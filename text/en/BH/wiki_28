<text>Malcolm Stevenson Forbes (August 19, 1919 – February 24, 1990) was an American entrepreneur and politician most prominently known as the publisher of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, which was founded by his father B. C. Forbes. He was known as an avid promoter of capitalism and free market economics and for an extravagant lifestyle, spending on parties, travel, and his collection of homes, yachts, aircraft, art, motorcycles, and Fabergé eggs.

Forbes was also active in politics. He served two terms as a member of the New Jersey Senate representing Somerset County and ran two campaigns for Governor of New Jersey. In 1953, he lost the Republican nomination to Paul L. Troast, who had the support of most of the party establishment. In 1957, he was nominated but lost to incumbent Governor Robert Meyner.

==Life and career==
Forbes was born on August 19, 1919, in Englewood, New Jersey, the son of Adelaide Mary (Stevenson) and Scottish-born financial journalist and author B. C. Forbes. He graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1937. In 1941 he received an A.B. from the School of Public and International Affairs, now Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, at Princeton University, with a 176-page senior thesis, &quot;Weekly Newspapers - An Evaluation.&quot; Forbes enlisted in the Army in 1942 and served as a machine gunner in the 84th Infantry Division in Europe, rising to the rank of staff sergeant. Forbes received a thigh wound in combat, and received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
After dabbling in politics, including service in the New Jersey Senate from 1951 to 1957 and an unsuccessful candidacy for Governor of New Jersey, he committed himself full time to the magazine by 1957, three years after his father&#x27;s death. After the death of his brother Bruce Charles Forbes in 1964, he acquired sole control of the company.

The magazine grew steadily, and Forbes diversified his investments into real estate sales and other ventures. One of his last projects was the magazine &quot;Egg&quot;, which chronicled New York&#x27;s nightlife. (The title had nothing to do with Forbes&#x27;s famous Fabergé egg collection.) To honor his contribution to the magazine, Forbes won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1989.

Forbes was an avid but idiosyncratic collector. In addition to a huge art collection and a collection of historical documents, he collected Harley-Davidson motorbikes and specially shaped hot air balloons. He owned more than 365 works by Peter Carl Fabergé, including a dozen Imperial eggs.

Malcolm Forbes&#x27; lavish lifestyle was exemplified by his private &quot;Capitalist Tool&quot; Boeing 727 trijet, ever-larger &quot;Highlander&quot; yachts, and his French Chateau (Château de Balleroy in Normandy) as well as his opulent birthday parties. In the mid-1960s he was a fixture at NYC&#x27;s famous Cat Club on Wednesday nights, supporting local musical talent.

He chose the Mendoub Palace (which he had acquired from the Moroccan government in 1970) in the northwestern city of Tangier, Morocco, to host his 70th birthday party. Spending an estimated $2.5 million, he chartered a Boeing 747, a Douglas DC-8 and a Concorde to fly in eight hundred of the world&#x27;s rich and famous from New York and London. The guests included his friend Elizabeth Taylor (who acted as a co-host), Gianni Agnelli, Robert Maxwell, Barbara Walters, Henry Kissinger, six U.S. state governors, and the CEOs of scores of multinational corporations likely to advertise in his magazine. The party entertainment was on a grand scale, including 600 drummers, acrobats and dancers and a fantasia—a cavalry charge ending with the firing of muskets into the air—by 300 Berber horsemen. Party favors included a custom-engraved Rolex watch for each guest.

Forbes became a motorcyclist late in life. He founded and rode with a motorcycle club called the Capitalist Tools. His estate in New Jersey was a regular meeting place for tours that he organized for fellow New Jersey and New York motorcyclists. He had a stable of motorcycles but was partial to Harley-Davidson machines. He was known for his gift of Purple Passion, a Harley-Davidson, to actress Elizabeth Taylor. He was also instrumental in getting legislation passed to allow motorcycles on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Forbes was married for thirty-nine years to Roberta Remsen Laidlaw before their divorce in 1985. The couple had five children: Malcolm S. Jr., Robert Laidlaw, Christopher Charles, Timothy Carter, and Moira Hamilton. Steve Forbes ran unsuccessfully for president in 1996 and 2000.

While living abroad, his father returned to Buchan, Aberdeenshire, every two years, staying in the Cruden Bay Hotel, &quot;to entertain people of Whitehill to a picnic&quot;. It was a tradition revived by Malcolm in 1987.

In March 1990, soon after his death, &quot;OutWeek&quot; magazine published a story with the cover headline &quot;The Secret Gay Life of Malcolm Forbes&quot;, by Michelangelo Signorile, which alleged Forbes was a gay man. Signorile was critical of the media for helping Forbes publicize many aspects of his life while keeping his homosexuality a secret. The writer asked, &quot;Is our society so overwhelmingly repressive that even individuals as all-powerful as the late Malcolm Forbes feel they absolutely cannot come out of the closet?&quot; Even in death, the media was reluctant to disclose his sexuality; when &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the controversy, they did not name Forbes in their coverage, referring only to news about a &quot;famous, deceased millionaire&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Forbes died in 1990 of a heart attack at age 70 at his home, Timberfield, in Far Hills, New Jersey. He was pronounced dead by his friend and physician Dr. Oscar Kruesi.

Since Malcolm Forbes&#x27;s death, the magazine business has been run by his son Steve Forbes and granddaughter Moira Forbes.

<doc id="327410" wikidata="Q7763337" url="?curid=327410" title="The Sequence">
<text>The Sequence was an American female hip–hop trio from Columbia, South Carolina, who formed in 1979. The Sequence is noted as the first female hip hop trio signed to the Sugar Hill Records label in the late–1970s and early–1980s. The group consisted of Cheryl Cook, known as &quot;Cheryl The Pearl&quot;, Gwendolyn Chisolm, known as &quot;Blondy&quot;, and lead singer and rapper Angie Stone, known as Angie B, who were all high school friends.

==Background==
The trio was noticed when they bum rushed a performance by the Sugarhill Gang and sang for them and Sylvia Robinson backstage. Their most notable single was &quot;Funk You Up&quot; (1979), which was the first rap record released by a female group and the second single released by Sugar Hill Records.

Elements of &quot;Funk You Up&quot; were later used by Dr. Dre for his 1995 single &quot;Keep Their Heads Ringin&#x27;&quot;. The group backed Spoonie Gee on the single &quot;Monster Jam&quot; (1980). Their single &quot;Funky Sound (Tear the Roof Off)&quot; (1981) was a remake of the single &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot; (1976) by Parliament. The group&#x27;s other charting single was &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Your Love (Part One)&quot; (1982). Angie Stone subsequently became a member of Vertical Hold and later a solo artist.

In September 2011, without Angie Stone, Cheryl Cook and Gwendolyn Chisolm released a single entitled &quot;On Our Way to the Movies&quot;. &quot;On Our Way to the Movies&quot; contains a sample of The Staple Singers&#x27; song &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;. In December 2017, the group, represented by attorney Antavius Weems, filed a Federal Copyright Infringement claim against Bruno Mars, claiming that his hit song &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; makes use of their 1970s hit &quot;Funk You Up&quot;.

<doc id="327411" wikidata="Q750623" url="?curid=327411" title="Crater of Diamonds State Park">
<text>Crater of Diamonds State Park is a Arkansas state park in Pike County, Arkansas, in the United States. The park features a plowed field, one of the few diamond-bearing sites accessible to the public. Diamonds have been discovered in the field continuously since 1906, including the graded-perfect Strawn-Wagner Diamond, found in 1990, and the Uncle Sam, found in 1924, which at over 40 carats is the largest diamond ever found in the United States.

The site became a state park in 1972 after the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism purchased the site from private owners in Dallas, Texas, who had previously operated the site as a tourist attraction.

==History==


In August 1906, John Huddleston found two strange crystals on the surface of his 243-acre farm near Murfreesboro, Arkansas. The following month, Huddleston and his wife, Sarah, sold an option on the property to a group of Little Rock investors headed by banker-attorney Samuel F. (Sam) Reyburn, who undertook a careful test of the property. From the sub-surface diamond matrix, Reyburn&#x27;s team extracted about two carats per hundred short tons of material (the standard tram-cart loads, each carrying about 1,600 pounds of material). Federal testing in 1943-1944 and State sponsored testing in the 1990s produced virtually the same result.

After 1906, several attempts at commercial diamond mining failed. The only significant yields came from the original surface layer on the east half of the Crater -- a black and sticky gumbo clay ranging from about one to four feet thick. Natural erosion, rocks, and vegetation had concentrated diamonds there over a long period of time.

In the early era, 1907–1932, companies finally gave up on conventional processing and adopted hydraulic mining to break down the black gumbo. That method was employed on a grand scale in California, to extract gold, and was already being used by one of Reyburn&#x27;s competitors on six acres at the north end of the Arkansas diamond field. Available photos of Reyburn&#x27;s property show large hoses spurting pressurized water, which carried material through sluice boxes where diamonds and other heavy minerals were concentrated for screening. Field crews also screened the pools of silt at the end of sluice boxes.

In Sam Reyburn&#x27;s hydraulic testing, the &quot;black gumbo&quot; surface material often yielded about thirty carats per hundred loads, a very high number compared with diamond fields generally. No doubt many diamonds were lost in that process, including some large ones. In 1908 and 1943-1944, careful testing of the underlying volcanic breccia found about two carats per 100 tons. Pit testing sponsored by the State of Arkansas in the 1990s found virtually the same yield.

Because equipment of the early period usually included bottom screens with mesh larger than 1/16th inch, thousands of smaller diamonds were allowed to pass through during testing. The bulk of these ended up in shallow drainage cuts all over the diamond field and in the big natural drains on its east and west edges. Since the State of Arkansas acquired the Crater, in 1972, regular plowing on the east side has marked the main field, 30 to 35 acres of easily eroded breccia. In recent decades, the old east and west drains have been especially fruitful for recreational diamond diggers. The regular diggers have worked especially hard for recoveries from the east drain, about ten feet deep: runoff from the field buried much of that channel during the early era; bulldozers finished the job while preparing access for a later test. Notable diamonds from the bottom of the east drain include the flawless white Strawn-Wagner diamond, weighing 3.03 carats in the rough. Shirley Strawn of Murfreesboro, Arkansas, came up with this celebrated gem in 1990.

Huddleston&#x27;s finds in 1906 hardly created a &quot;boomtown&quot; atmosphere around Murfreesboro. According to old tales, hotels in Murfreesboro turned away 10,000 people in the space of a year. Supposedly, aspiring diamond miners formed a &quot;tent city&#x27; near the diamond field and named it &quot;Kimberly&quot; in honor of the famous Kimberley diamond district in South Africa. On the other hand, all available evidence indicates that the Town of Kimberly originated as a land-development venture in 1909, initiated by Mallard M. Mauney and his oldest son, Walter, on their land immediately south of Murfreesboro. The project failed soon afterward as speculative publicity generated by the diamond discovery collapsed. There is no evidence of a tent city. Today, the Kimberly area is almost all cow pasture owned by Mauney&#x27;s descendants. As for any general diamond fever, that never developed: previous diamond-mining swindles in the American West had generated widespread skepticism. Before the State-sponsored testing of the 1990s, many observers still believed the Crater of Diamonds was &quot;salted.&quot;

During WWII the U.S. government took control of the diamond field and enlisted the Glen Martin corporation to extract diamonds for industrial use. Although diamonds were obtained, the yield remained about the same as earlier tests, and even the federal government thought that would be too costly for mining.

After the war, the property reverted to the private owners. From 1951 to 1972, the crater hosted several private tourist attractions. The first, The Diamond Preserve of the United States, lasted about one year. In late 1951, Howard A. Millar stepped in and salvaged the infant tourist industry. In April 1952, Millar and his wife, Modean, launched their tourist attraction on a small north section of the diamond-producing field. Howard Millar, an accomplished writer and promoter, stirred unprecedented national publicity and drew enough visitors to sustain the operation. In March 1956, a visitor found the &quot;Star of Arkansas&quot; on the cleared surface. That rare beauty, clean and brilliant in the raw, weighed 15.33|carats, enough to generate unprecedented national publicity.

Later, Roscoe Johnston opened a rival tourist attraction, the &quot;Arkansas Diamond Mine&quot;, on the main part of the diamond field. The rivalry between the two operations left both in a weakened position. In 1970, the entire volcanic formation was consolidated by a private partnership, which then reassigned the property to General Earth Minerals (GEM) of Dallas, Texas. GEM expected to turn the property over for a profit, but ended up heavily indebted to GF Industries (GFI) of Dallas. Upon default, GFI took the property in July 1971.

GEM consolidated the tourist operations as well as the property. GFI continued the attraction until it sold the 80-acre volcanic formation and a surrounding 800 acres to the State of Arkansas, in March 1972. The price: $750,000. The tourist operation continued as the centerpiece of Crater of Diamonds State Park.

Understandably, this special gem became closely associated with the State of Arkansas, &quot;The Natural State.&quot; A large diamond symbol has dominated the state flag since 1912. The federal government issued an Arkansas State quarter coin in 2003. It bore a diamond symbol on its face, as did new Arkansas auto license plates.
==Geology==

The Crater of Diamonds is part of a 100-million-year-old eroded volcanic formation (a volcanic pipe). The deeply sourced Kimberlite/Lamproite magma brought the diamonds to the surface. The diamonds had crystallized in the relatively stable cratonic root of the continent long before and were sampled by the magma as it rose to the surface.

The geology of the area and the diamond formation process itself were the subjects of the Ph.D. dissertation of Roland Everett Langford in 1973 of the University of Georgia. In it, he proposed a gas phase reaction from the reduction of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper mantle. The dissertation was on display at the state park for many years.

More recent research by geologist Dennis Dunn (Ph.D. dissertation 2002) found that the diamondiferous epiclastic rocks range from olivine lamproite to phlogopite and olivine-rich tuffs. The chemistry of the mantle xenolith was used to derive maximum pressures of around 5 GPa and temperatures of 1000 °C for the upper mantle origin of the lamproitic magma.

The lamproite diamond source is unusual, as almost all diamonds are mined from kimberlite formations and from alluvial deposits of diamonds weathered from that &quot;hardrock&quot; source. The most prominent lamproite diamond source is the Argyle diamond mine in Australia. It is notable that the physical characteristics of Australian lamproite and the Arkansas deposit differ markedly. From the discovery in 1906 into the 1960s, the historical record shows that geologists consistently classified the Arkansas deposit as Kimberlite.

==Recreation==

Crater of Diamonds State Park is known for the plowed field on which visitors can hunt for diamonds and other semi-precious gems. On average, two diamonds are found per day by park visitors. A visitor center contains information about the geology of the park, a gift shop, and a cafe. Interested visitors can continue to the Diamond Discovery Center, which offers an interpretive look at prospecting for diamonds. The Diamond Springs aquatic playground, enclosed pavilion, trails, and picnic areas surround the diamond field. The park offers campers 47 Class AAA facilities near the Little Missouri River.

===Diamond mine===
Crater of Diamonds State Park is situated over an eroded lamproite volcanic pipe. The park is open to the public and, for a small fee, rockhounds and visitors can dig for diamonds and other gemstones. Park visitors find more than 600 diamonds each year of all colors and grades. As of 2015 over 75,000 diamonds had been found in the crater. Visitors may keep any gemstone they find regardless of its value.

In addition to diamonds, visitors may find semi-precious gems such as amethyst, agate, and jasper or approximately 40 other minerals such as garnet, phlogopite, quartz, baryte, and calcite.

<text>Scheherazade () is a major character and the storyteller in the frame narrative of the Middle Eastern collection of tales known as the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

== Name ==
According to modern scholarship, the name &quot;Scheherazade&quot; derives from the Middle Persian name , which is composed of the words () and (). The earliest forms of Scheherazade&#x27;s name in Arabic sources include () in al-Masudi, and in Ibn al-Nadim.

The name appears as in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; and as in 
the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;. Among standard 19th-century printed editions, the name appears as in Macnaghten&#x27;s Calcutta edition (1839–1842) and in the 1862 Bulaq edition, and as in the Breslau edition (1825–1843). Muhsin Mahdi&#x27;s critical edition has .

The spelling &quot;Scheherazade&quot; first appeared in English-language texts in 1801, borrowed from German usage.
==History==
The oldest known text of the tale of Scheherazade is a ninth century (CE) Arabic manuscript from Cairo. By the twelfth century the 1001 Nights was established, with the story of Scheherazade being its frame.

== Narration ==
The story goes that the monarch Shahryar, on discovering that his first wife was unfaithful to him, resolved to marry a new virgin every day and to have her beheaded the next morning before she could dishonor him. Eventually, the vizier could find no more virgins of noble blood and, against her father&#x27;s wishes, Scheherazade volunteered to marry the king.

Sir Richard Burton&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Nights&quot; describes Scheherazade in this way:

Once in the king&#x27;s chambers, Scheherazade asked if she might bid one last farewell to her beloved younger sister, Dunyazad, who had secretly been prepared to ask Scheherazade to tell a story during the long night. The king lay awake and listened with awe as Scheherazade told her first story. The night passed by, and Scheherazade stopped in the middle. The king asked her to finish, but Scheherazade said there was no time, as dawn was breaking. So the king spared her life for one day so she could finish the story the next night. The following night Scheherazade finished the story and then began a second, more exciting tale, which she again stopped halfway through at dawn. Again, the king spared her life for one more day so that she could finish the second story.

Thus the king kept Scheherazade alive day by day, as he eagerly anticipated the conclusion of each previous night&#x27;s story. At the end of 1,001 nights, and 1,000 stories, Scheherazade finally told the king that she had no more tales to tell him. She summoned her three sons that she had borne him during the 1000 nights to come in before the king (one was a nursling, one was crawling, and one could walk) and she placed them in front of the king. Then she kissed the ground again and said: &quot;King of the age, these are your children and my wish is that as an act of generosity towards them to free me from sentence of death, for if you kill me, these babies will have no mother and you will find no other woman to bring them up so well.&quot; The king granted her a pardon as he could see that she was a &quot;chaste and pure woman, freeborn and God-fearing.&quot; He then presented a splendid and magnificent robe to Scheherazade&#x27;s father, the vizier, and she was celebrated throughout his kingdom for 30 days.

<text>Souls of Mischief is a hip hop group from Oakland, California, that is also part of the hip hop collective Hieroglyphics. The Souls of Mischief formed in 1991 and is composed of rappers A-Plus, Opio, Phesto, and Tajai.

==History==
East Oakland native Tajai began rhyming with future bandmate A-Plus at age 8, while both were in elementary school. Tajai and Phesto met later in junior high school. Tajai recruited his best friend Phesto in middle school and A-Plus brought Opio into the budding act in high school before making its major-label debut on Jive Records with the group&#x27;s well-received album &quot;93 &#x27;til Infinity&quot;, in 1993.

The group is part of the hip-hop collective Hieroglyphics, along with emcees Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Casual, Pep Love, Jaybiz, and producer Domino. The group participated as full members in all three of Hieroglyphics&#x27; studio albums: 1998&#x27;s &quot;3rd Eye Vision&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Full Circle&quot;, and 2013&#x27;s The Kitchen.

&quot;93 ’til Infinity&quot; is the group&#x27;s highest charting album to date (#17 Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums; #85 &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) and, in January, 1998, was named one of the Top 100 Rap albums by &quot;The Source&quot; magazine.

The group stayed with Jive for one more album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, before being released from the label during the same year.

The group released two albums on Hiero&#x27;s self-owned independent label, Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings: 1998&#x27;s &quot;Focus&quot;, and 2000&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

On October 30, 2006, &quot;Hierocast&quot; (Hieroglyphics&#x27; official podcast), Del tha Funkee Homosapien reported that the Souls of Mischief was currently working on its next studio album with Prince Paul (De La Soul, Gravediggaz, Handsome Boy Modeling School).

On January 6, 2009, Souls of Mischief released the &quot;Tour Stories&quot; EP produced by Domino and co-produced by Prince Paul. The song is taken from the group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, released on Hieroglyphics Imperium.

In 2013, a documentary about the band was released entitled &quot;Til Infinity: The Souls of Mischief&quot;. Produced and directed by Shomari Smith, it reflected on the 20-year anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;93 &#x27;Til Infinity&quot; and includes over 50 interviews with prominent MCs, DJs, and producers of the era.

During the 2017 NBA Playoffs, Gatorade released a television commercial promoting Gatorade Flow, which featured Indiana Pacers star forward Paul George and the instrumental music of Souls of Mischief&#x27; &quot;93 &#x27;Til Infinity&quot;.

<doc id="327418" wikidata="Q780842" url="?curid=327418" title="Steve Forbes">
<text>Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr. (; born July 18, 1947) is an American publishing executive and politician who is the editor-in-chief of &quot;Forbes&quot;, a business magazine. He is the son of longtime &quot;Forbes&quot; publisher Malcolm Forbes and the grandson of that publication&#x27;s founder B.C. Forbes. He is an adviser at the Forbes School of Business &amp; Technology. Forbes was a candidate in the 1996 and 2000 Republican presidential primaries. He was also appointed chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) in 1985, and was reappointed again in 1993.

==Early life and education==
Forbes was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Roberta Remsen (née Laidlaw) and Malcolm Forbes. Forbes grew up in Far Hills, New Jersey. He attended the Far Hills Country Day School with his longtime friend and future Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, in 1966.

Forbes graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1970 after completing a 75-page long senior thesis titled &quot;Contest for the 1892 Democratic Presidential Nomination.&quot; While at Princeton, Forbes founded his first magazine, &quot;Business Today&quot;, with two other students. &quot;Business Today&quot; is currently the largest student-run magazine in the world. Forbes is a member of Alpha Kappa Psi and Tau Kappa Epsilon. He holds honorary degrees from several universities, including the New York Institute of Technology and Lehigh University.

== Political career and views ==

===Early political career===
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan appointed Forbes as head of the Board of International Broadcasting (BIB), which historically managed the operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Reagan&#x27;s successor, George H. W. Bush reappointed Forbes to the position. Forbes would continue to serve as the BIB&#x27;s leader until 1993, following the inauguration of Bill Clinton.

Following his career as the BIB&#x27;s head, Forbes went on to get involved in various conservative political advocacy groups. From 1993 to 1996, Forbes was the chairman of the Board of Directors of &quot;Empower America&quot;, which later merged with the advocacy group FreedomWorks. Through &quot;Empower America&quot;, Forbes became associates with prominent conservative politician Jack Kemp, who would go on to endorse Forbes during the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries. From 1996 to 1999, Forbes also served as honorary chairman of the advocacy group &quot;Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity&quot;, described as &quot;a grassroots, issues-advocacy organization founded to advance pro-growth, pro-freedom and pro-family issues.&quot;

Forbes helped craft Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s plan for a 30% cut in New Jersey&#x27;s income tax over three years, and this plan proved to be a major factor in her victory over incumbent Governor James Florio. Despite Forbes and Whitman being childhood friends, Forbes would later distance himself from Whitman during his bid for the Republican nomination in 2000 owing to Whitman&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion.

===Campaigns for president===

Forbes entered the Republican primaries for President of the United States in 1996 and 2000, primarily running on a campaign to establish a flat income tax (Forbes&#x27;s emphasis on the flat tax proposal was so heavy that he was described as a &quot;single-issue candidate&quot;, a label he claimed was inaccurate). Forbes believed the American taxation system had become too Byzantine and bureaucratic and was in desperate need of reform and simplification. Forbes also supported the ideas of reintroducing 4.5% mortgages and term limits in 1996; however, he dropped both in 2000, as they were minor planks in his overall platform.

When Forbes ran for president in 1996 and 2000, he sold some of his Forbes, Inc. voting shares to other family members to help finance his run. Forbes did not come close to securing the Republican nomination, despite winning the Arizona and Delaware primaries in 1996 and getting some significant shares of the vote in other primaries. Forbes&#x27;s &quot;awkward&quot; campaigning style was considered to be a major factor in his defeat. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; called his stumping a &quot;comedy-club impression of what would happen if some mad scientist decided to construct a dork robot.&quot; Jeff Lyon of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote of Forbes on the campaign trail, &quot;[Forbes] resembles the classic , with a prissy smile, gold-rimmed glasses that make his eyes look smaller, and a stiff way of presenting himself when he works a crowd. He has a cornball style and uses preppie slang like &#x27;get real&#x27; and &#x27;el zippo&#x27; (meaning zero) in speeches.&quot; Forbes and his campaign staff were known for travelling between campaign stops via their &quot;big silver bus.&quot; For his 2000 presidential campaign, he raised $86,000,000 in campaign contributions, of which $37,000,000 was self-donated.
After dropping out early in the 2000 primary season, Forbes returned to heading the magazine and company. During the 1996 campaign, insiders at &quot;Fortune&quot; alleged that stories about Forbes&#x27;s advertisers became favorably biased toward them.

Major issues Forbes has supported include free trade, health savings accounts, and allowing people to opt out 75% of Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts (PRAs). Forbes supports traditional Republican Party policies such as downsizing government agencies to balance the budget, tough crime laws, support for the death penalty, and school vouchers. Forbes opposes gun control and most government regulation of the environment, as well as drug legalization and same-sex marriage, in spite of his father being gay. In terms of foreign policy, he called for a &quot;US not UN foreign policy&quot; (which is composed of anti-International Monetary Fund sentiments, pro-Israeli sentiment, opposition to Most Favored Nation status for the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and anti-UN sentiment.)

Forbes&#x27;s flat-tax plan has changed slightly. In 1996, Forbes supported a flat tax of 17% on all personal and corporate earned income (unearned income such as capital gains, pensions, inheritance, and savings would be exempt). However, Forbes supported keeping the first $33,000 of income exempt. In 2000, Forbes maintained the same plan; however, instead of each person receiving an exemption of $33,000, it more closely resembled the Armey Plan (Forbes&#x27;s version called for a $13,000-per-adult and $5,000-per-dependent deduction). Forbes is very wealthy, with a net worth in 1996 of $430 million. In response to this criticism, Forbes promised in his 2000 campaign to exempt himself from the benefits of the flat tax, although he did support the repeal of the 16th Amendment in a debate with Alan Keyes the previous year.

In his 2000 campaign, Forbes professed his support for social conservatism along with his supply-side economics. Despite holding opposite positions in 1996, for the 2000 campaign Forbes announced he was adamantly opposed to abortion and supported prayer in public schools. The previous year Forbes had issued a statement saying he would no longer donate money to Princeton University because of its hiring of philosopher Peter Singer, who views personhood as being limited to &#x27;sentient&#x27; beings and therefore considers some disabled people and all infants to lack this status. Steve Forbes was one of the signers of the Statement of Principles of Project for the New American Century (PNAC) on June 3, 1997.

===Other political activities===
In 1996, Forbes campaigned on behalf of Ron Paul in the congressional election for Texas&#x27;s 14th congressional district.

Actor Mark McKinney played Steve Forbes on the comedy television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a program known for featuring political satire. In an episode which aired on March 16, 1996—shortly after Forbes dropped out of the 1996 presidential race—McKinney played Forbes in a skit in which Forbes purchases land in Russia to found his own country, called &quot;Forbes America&quot;. Forbes himself hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that aired on April 13, 1996. The episode featured a skit in which Forbes earnestly wishes to answer the questions of potential voters, but all the questions he receives instead have to do with his enormous personal wealth (for example, with regards to the then ongoing war in Bosnia, Forbes is asked by an audience member, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just buy Bosnia and tell all those people over there that if they don&#x27;t stop fighting you&#x27;ll just, you know, throw them the hell out?&quot;). On that same episode, Forbes starred in a skit, playing a roofer, the comedy deriving from Forbes&#x27;s character being a tough blue collar worker, a personality which clashes with Forbes&#x27;s nerdy, intellectual demeanor and appearance. The episode also featured a skit where the real Forbes interviewed his &quot;SNL&quot; counterpart, played by McKinney.

In December 2006, Forbes joined the Board of Directors of the advocacy organization FreedomWorks. Forbes is also on the board of directors of the National Taxpayers Union. Forbes is also a member of the board of trustees of The Heritage Foundation, an influential Washington, D.C.–based public policy research institute. Forbes is a frequent panelist on the television program &quot;Forbes on Fox&quot;, which also features members of the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine staff and is shown Saturday mornings on Fox News Channel at 11:00 a.m. EST.

On March 28, 2007, Forbes joined Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s campaign for the 2008 presidential election, serving as a National Co- and Senior Policy Advisor. Later in the 2008 presidential campaign, Forbes served as John McCain&#x27;s economic adviser on taxes, energy and the budget during McCain&#x27;s bid for the 2008 presidential election.

In March 2013, Forbes participated in an NPR broadcast Intelligence Squared debate with James Grant, Frederic Mishkin and John R. Taylor Jr. concerning the motion &quot;Does America Need A Strong Dollar Policy?&quot;.

Forbes endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election.

==Personal life==
In 1971, he married Sabina Beekman. They have five daughters, including Moira Forbes. Forbes appeared alongside his family on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; during his 1996 presidential campaign. Forbes has been a resident of Bedminster, New Jersey.

Forbes rides Amtrak trains and was a passenger on board the 2016 Chester, Pennsylvania, train derailment.

<text>Duane Hughes, better known by his stage name Spyder D, is an American old-school rapper and producer from New York City.

== Career ==

=== 1980s ===
&quot;Big Apple Rappin&#x27; was released on his own Newtroit Records in 1980, placing it among hip-hop&#x27;s earliest single releases. Another notable release was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait (To Rock The Mike),&quot; a version of the Nu Shooz hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; released in 1986 as a single. Other Spyder D releases include &quot;Buckwheat&#x27;s Rap&quot; (released by Profile in 1985), and &quot;Smerphie&#x27;s Dance,&quot; which has been sampled on other tracks including How We Do by The Game.

Childhood schoolmate Russell Simmons later became his manager and mentor in 1983. Spyder produced several tracks for artists such as Infinity Machine&#x27;s DJ Divine, Sparky D, Roxanne Shante&#x27;, as well as a string of tracks for independent labels such as Profile Records, Select Records, Spring Records, and a joint label venture with Next Plateau (launching Fly Spy Records). He also managed Power Play Studios in Queens, from various stints from 1983 to 1998. He lived in Los Angeles between 1989 and 1992, where he worked with KDAY-AM&#x27;s Greg Mack and Curtis Harmon.

Spyder co-engineered and recorded his first full album, &quot;Gangsta Wages&quot;, with multi-platinum &quot;remixologist&quot; Greg Royal, which was released through his own Hype-Hop label. The imprint was distributed through Macola Records who, at the time also signed 2 Live Crew and Dr. Dre’s World Class Wrecking Crew. Spyder worked in the studio with Malcolm McClaren on writing lyrics for Sparky D for McClaren&#x27;s Hip-Hop/Opera fusion.

=== 1990s ===

In 1996, after once again taking over the reins as Power Play Studios full time manager, Spyder began a dual role as both engineer and manager for the renowned studio. He learned to use the state of the art SSL G Series recording and mixing console from some notes given to him by chief engineer Dino. He brought back into the studio clients like DJ Run of Run-DMC, producer Larry Smith (Whodini, Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash), Herbie Azor and Salt-n-Pepa, as well as bringing in new superstar producers like P Diddy Hit Squad producer Ron (Amen Ra) Lawrence.

In 1997, Spyder moved on to become manager and engineer for Gospel Jazz musician Mel Holder at Toy Factory, another Queens, NY based recording studio. At Toy Factory he engineered for such clients as Mic Murphy of The System, and Pharaoh Monch of Organized Konfusion, as well as on Mel Holder’s stirring saxophone rendition of R. Kelly’s &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;.

In 1999, Spyder moved to Atlanta, and began freelance engineering at Dallas Austin&#x27;s DARP Studios, and Bobby Brown’s Boss Recording, bringing with him some of his New York and northeast clientele, including Jam-Master Jay protégé Derrick Stanfield-Kivoi.

=== 2000s ===
He released a full-length album in 2000 entitled &quot;True Dat&quot;.

In 2005, Spyder became the owner of an American Basketball Association franchise, the Charlotte Krunk (named after a type of hip hop music). Dr Glenn Toby, founder of The Book Bank Foundation and former rap rival from Queens, New York (known then in the rap world as &quot;Mr Sweety G&quot;) was his business partner and investor in The Atlanta Krunk. The franchise moved to Atlanta and joined the Continental Basketball Association under new majority owner Freedom Williams, the former lead voice for multi-platinum dance-hop group C+C Music Factory, where Spyder signed Grayson Boucher, AKA &quot; The Professor,&quot; of And 1 fame, and recruited Kenny Anderson as head coach.

<doc id="327421" wikidata="Q109214" url="?curid=327421" title="A Momentary Lapse of Reason">
<text>A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in the UK on 7 September 1987 by EMI and the following day in the US on Columbia. It was recorded primarily on the converted houseboat &quot;Astoria&quot;, belonging to the guitarist, David Gilmour.

&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was the first Pink Floyd album recorded without the founding member Roger Waters, who departed in 1985. The production was marred by legal fights over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, which were not resolved until several months after release. It also saw the return of the keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who was fired by Waters during the recording of &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979). Wright returned as a session player.

Unlike most of Pink Floyd&#x27;s preceding studio records, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; is not a concept album. It includes writing contributions from outside songwriters, following Gilmour&#x27;s decision to include material once intended for his third solo album. The album was promoted with three singles: the double A-side &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; / &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;, &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;, and &quot;One Slip&quot;.

&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; received mixed reviews; some critics praised the production and instrumentation but criticised Gilmour&#x27;s songwriting, and it was derided by Waters. It reached number three in the UK and US, and outsold Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983). It was supported by a successful world tour between 1987 and 1989, including a free performance on a barge floating on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.

==Background==
After the release of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, viewed by some as a &quot;de facto&quot; solo record by bassist and songwriter Roger Waters, the band members worked on solo projects. Guitarist David Gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo album, &quot;About Face&quot; (1984), and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo album, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;. Although both had enlisted a range of successful performers, including in Waters&#x27; case Eric Clapton, their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts, and critic David Fricke felt that Waters&#x27; show was &quot;a petulant echo, a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters &quot;was&quot; Pink Floyd&quot;. Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour, this time without the support of CBS Records, which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album; Waters criticised the corporation as &quot;a machine&quot;.

After drummer Nick Mason attended one of Waters&#x27; London performances in 1985, he found he missed touring under the Pink Floyd name. His visit coincided with the release in August of his second solo album, &quot;Profiles&quot;, on which Gilmour sang. With a shared love of aviation, Mason and Gilmour were taking flying lessons and together bought a de Havilland Dove aeroplane. Gilmour was working on other collaborations, including a performance for Bryan Ferry at 1985&#x27;s Live Aid concert, and co-produced the Dream Academy&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

In December 1985, Waters announced that he had left Pink Floyd, which he believed was &quot;a spent force creatively&quot;. After the failure of his &quot;About Face&quot; tour, Gilmour hoped to continue with the Pink Floyd name. The threat of a lawsuit from Gilmour, Mason and CBS Records was meant to compel Waters to write and produce another Pink Floyd album with his bandmates, who had barely participated in making &quot;The Final Cut&quot;; Gilmour was especially critical of the album, labelling it &quot;cheap filler&quot; and &quot;meandering rubbish&quot;.
According to Gilmour, &quot;I told [Waters] before he left, &#x27;If you go, man, we&#x27;re carrying on. Make no bones about it, &quot;we would carry on&quot;″, and Roger replied: &#x27;You&#x27;ll never fucking do it.&#x27;&quot; Waters had written to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. This left Gilmour and Mason, in their view, free to continue with the Pink Floyd name. In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had not understood English jurisprudence.

In Waters&#x27; absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hook End studio, where he composed the chord progression that became &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters&#x27; offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;, saying it was &quot;far easier for Dave and I to do &quot;our&quot; version of a Floyd record&quot;. Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as &quot;mucking about with a lot of demos&quot;.

At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music &quot;doesn&#x27;t sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd&quot;. By the end of that year, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, and agreed to rework the material that Ralbovsky had found objectionable.

==Recording==

Gilmour experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;. Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour chose a more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. Gilmour later said that the project had been difficult without Waters.

&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason &quot;was recorded in several studios, mainly Gilmour&#x27;s houseboat studio &quot;Astoria, &quot;moored on the Thames; according to Ezrin, &quot;working there was just magical, so inspirational; kids sculling down the river, geese flying by...&quot;. Andy Jackson was brought in to engineer. During sessions held between November 1986 and February 1987, Gilmour&#x27;s band worked on new material, which in a change from previous Pink Floyd albums was mostly recorded with a 32-track ProDigi digital recorder apart from the drum tracks, which were recorded with a 24-track analogue machine. This trend of using new technologies continued with the use of MIDI synchronisation, aided by an Apple Macintosh computer.

Ezrin suggested incorporating rap, an idea dismissed by Gilmour. After agreeing to rework the material that Ralbovsky had found objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. Both drummers replaced Mason on several songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. Some drum parts were also performed by drum machines. In his memoir, Mason wrote: &quot;In hindsight, I really should have had the self-belief to play all the drum parts. And in the early days of life after Roger, I think David and I felt that we had to get it right, or we would be slaughtered.&quot;

During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd&#x27;s former keyboardist, Richard Wright, if he could contribute. A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1981, and there were legal obstacles to his return; after a meeting in Hampstead he was recruited as a paid musician on a weekly wage of $11,000. Gilmour said in an interview that Wright&#x27;s presence &quot;would make us stronger legally and musically&quot;. However, his contributions were minimal; most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, and added vocal harmonies. He also performed a solo in &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;, which was discarded, according to Wright, &quot;not because they didn&#x27;t like it ... they just thought it didn&#x27;t fit&quot;.

Gilmour later said: &quot;Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. In my view, they&#x27;d been destroyed by Roger.&quot; Gilmour&#x27;s comments angered Mason, who said: &quot;I&#x27;d deny that I was catatonic. I&#x27;d expect that from the opposition, it&#x27;s less attractive from one&#x27;s allies. At some point, he made some sort of apology.&quot; Mason conceded that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.
&quot;Learning to Fly&quot; was inspired by Gilmour&#x27;s flying lessons, which occasionally conflicted with his studio duties. The track also contains a recording of Mason&#x27;s voice during takeoff. The band experimented with samples, and Ezrin recorded the sound of Gilmour&#x27;s boatman Langley Iddens rowing across the Thames. Iddens&#x27; presence at the sessions became vital when &quot;Astoria&quot; began to lift in response to the rapidly rising river, which was pushing the boat against the pier on which it was moored.

&quot;The Dogs of War&quot; is a song about &quot;physical and political mercenaries&quot;, according to Gilmour. It came about through a mishap in the studio when a sampling machine began playing a sample of laughter, which Gilmour thought sounded like a dog&#x27;s bark. &quot;Terminal Frost&quot; was one of Gilmour&#x27;s older demos, which he decided to leave as an instrumental. Conversely, the lyrics for &quot;Sorrow&quot; were written before the music. The song&#x27;s opening guitar solo was recorded in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. A 24-track mobile studio piped Gilmour&#x27;s guitar tracks through a public address system, and the resulting mix was then recorded in surround sound.

=== Legal disputes ===

The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O&#x27;Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd&#x27;s clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to &quot;the new Pink Floyd project&quot;. He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band&#x27;s name. Gilmour&#x27;s team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reporter: &quot;Roger is a dog in the manger and I&#x27;m going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.&quot;

Waters twice visited &quot;Astoria&quot;, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin, who later suggested that he was being &quot;checked out&quot;. As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles: &quot;It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn&#x27;t call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.&quot; The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which became the magazine&#x27;s best-selling issue of that year. The legal disputes were resolved out of court by the end of 1987.

==Packaging and title==

Careful consideration was given to the album&#x27;s title, with the initial three contenders being &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, &quot;Of Promises Broken&quot; and &quot;Delusions of Maturity&quot;. The final title appears as a line in the chorus of &quot;One Slip&quot;.

For the first time since 1977&#x27;s &quot;Animals&quot;, designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover. His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; and Gilmour&#x27;s vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as &quot;vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes&quot;. The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds assembled in July 1987 on Saunton Sands in North Devon, where some of the scenes for &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; were filmed. The beds were arranged by Thorgerson&#x27;s colleague Colin Elgie. A hang glider in the sky references &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;. The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image, which took about two weeks to create. Some versions of the cover do not feature the hang glider, and other versions feature a nurse making one of the beds.

To emphasise that Waters had left the band, the inner gatefold featured a photograph of just Gilmour and Mason shot by David Bailey. Its inclusion marked the first time since &quot;Meddle&quot; (1971) that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album. Wright was represented only by name, on the credits. According to Mason, Wright&#x27;s leaving agreement contained a clause that prevented him rejoining the band, and &quot;consequently we had to be careful about what constituted being a member&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was released in the UK and US on 7 September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot in the US by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; and Whitesnake&#x27;s self-titled album. It spent 34 weeks on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified silver and gold in the UK on 1 October 1987, and gold and platinum in the US on 9 November. It went double platinum on 18 January the following year, triple platinum on 10 March 1992, and quadruple platinum on 16 August 2001, greatly outselling &quot;The Final Cut&quot;.

Gilmour presented &quot;A Momentary Lapse&quot; as a return to an older Pink Floyd sound, citing his belief that under Waters&#x27; tenure, lyrics had become more important than music. He said that their albums &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were successful &quot;not just because of Roger&#x27;s contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics [than on later albums]&quot;. Waters said of &quot;A Momentary Lapse&quot;: &quot;I think it&#x27;s very facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general; the lyrics I can&#x27;t quite believe. Gilmour&#x27;s lyrics are very third-rate.&quot; Wright said Waters&#x27; criticisms were &quot;fair&quot;. In a later interview, Waters said the album had &quot;a couple of really nice tunes&quot; and chord sequences and melodies he would have retained had he been involved.

In &quot;Q&quot;, Phil Sutcliffe wrote that it &quot;does sound like a Pink Floyd album&quot; and highlighted the two-part &quot;A New Machine&quot; as &quot;a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration&quot; and a &quot;brilliant stroke of imagination&quot;. He concluded: &quot;&quot;A Momentary Lapse&quot; is Gilmour&#x27;s album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd&#x27;s name were dominated by Waters … Clearly it wasn&#x27;t only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand-name.&quot; Recognising the return to a more music-oriented approach, &quot;Sounds&quot; said the album was &quot;back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy, moons have dark sides, and mothers have atom hearts&quot;.

Conversely, Greg Quill of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote: &quot;Something&#x27;s missing here. This is, for all its lumbering weight, not a record that challenges and provokes as Pink Floyd should. &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, sorry to say, is mundane, predictable.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;You&#x27;d hardly know the group&#x27;s conceptmaster was gone – except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas.&quot; In 2016, AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann described it as a &quot;Gilmour solo album in all but name&quot;.

In 2016, Nick Shilton chose &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; as one of the &quot;Top 10 Essential 80s Prog Albums&quot; for &quot;Prog&quot;. He wrote: &quot;While it&#x27;s not a patch on the Floyd masterworks of the 70s, it merits inclusion here. The ironically titled &#x27;Signs of Life&#x27; is an instrumental prelude for &#x27;Learning to Fly&#x27; which showcases Gilmour&#x27;s guitar, while the pulsating &#x27;The Dogs of War&#x27; is considerably darker, and the uplifting &#x27;On the Turning Away&#x27; simply sublime.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was reissued in 1988 as a limited-edition vinyl with posters and a guaranteed ticket application for Pink Floyd&#x27;s upcoming UK concerts. It was digitally remastered and rereleased in 1994. A tenth-anniversary edition was issued in the US in 1997.

In December 2019, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was reissued again as part of the &quot;Later Years&quot; box set. It was updated and remixed by Gilmour and Jackson, with restored contributions from Wright and newly recorded drum tracks from Mason to &quot;restore the creative balance between the three Pink Floyd members&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described this version as &quot;more tasteful ... [It] doesn&#x27;t drown in eighties reverb the way the original did ... Although none of the &quot;Momentary Lapse&quot; remixes will be dramatic enough to sway the band&#x27;s critics, they add clarity to what Gilmour was trying to achieve.&quot;

==Tour==
Pink Floyd toured for &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; before it was complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were out of practice, and, realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to take charge. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs; Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters and threatened to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name. Some promoters were offended by Waters&#x27; threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.

As the new line-up (with Wright) toured throughout North America, Waters&#x27; &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; tour was sometimes close by. Waters forbade the members of Pink Floyd to attend his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues. Waters also issued a writ for copyright fees for use of the Pink Floyd flying pig; Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon&#x27;s underside to distinguish it from Waters&#x27; design. By November 1987, Waters had given up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was reached at a meeting on &quot;Astoria&quot;.

The &quot;Momentary Lapse&quot; tour beat box office records in every US venue it booked, and was the most successful US tour that year. Tours of Australia, Japan, and Europe followed, before two more tours of the US. Almost every venue was sold out. A live album, &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot;, was released on 22 November 1988, followed in June 1989 by a concert video. A few days later, the live album was played in orbit, on board Soyuz TM-7. The tour eventually came to an end by closing the Silver Clef Award Winners Concert, at Knebworth Park on 30 June 1990, after 200 performances, a gross audience of 4.25 million fans, and box office receipts of more than £60 million (not including merchandising). The tour included a free performance on a barge floating on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.

<doc id="327422" wikidata="Q1760152" url="?curid=327422" title="Newcleus">
<text>Newcleus was an American electro and old school hip hop group that gained popularity in the early 1980s. The group is primarily known for its 12-inch single &quot;Jam-On&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (re-released as &quot;Jam on Revenge (The Wikki-Wikki Song)&quot; (1983)) and &quot;Jam on It&quot; (1984). 

The group was based in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Their appearance overlapped with the formative years of hip-hop DJing in the Bronx.

The sequencer line from its 1984 song &quot;Automan&quot; was adapted by euro-dance project Snap! on the group’s 1992 single &quot;Rhythm is a Dancer,&quot; which featured lyrics written and performed by American singer and songwriter Thea Austin as well as hip hop rhymes by American rapper Turbo B, and became a major international hit.

==History==
===Formation===
A precursor to the group, known as Jam-On Productions, was formed in 1977 in Brooklyn, New York City, and included teenagers Ben &quot;Cozmo D&quot; Cenac and his cousins Monique and Pierre &quot;Pete&quot; Angevin. The group&#x27;s popularity grew as it played block parties in Brooklyn. By 1979, the primary group&#x27;s members were Cenac, Yvette &quot;Lady E&quot; Cook (who would later marry Cozmo D), Monique Angevin, and Bob &quot;Chilly B&quot; Crafton (who would later marry Angevin. The coming together of families inspired the name change to Newcleus.

===Success===
Newcleus recorded &quot;Jam-On Revenge,&quot; a block-party favorite featuring vocals that were sped up. The track impressed record producer Joe Webb, and it became the group&#x27;s first single in 1983 on Mayhew Records. Retitled as &quot;Jam On Revenge (The Wikki-Wikki Song)&quot;, the track reached the top 40 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. The group eventually signed with Sunnyview Records, which was later acquired by Rhino Records in the 1990s.

The follow-up, &quot;Jam on It,&quot; did well on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching No. 56. Both singles began as an anti-hip hop joke, according to founding member DJ and producer Ben Cenac. At the time (1981) we were going by the name Positive Messenger and were making music that had a purpose, either messages of love or faith or talking about the conditions of the world. However, we were still doing lots of Hip-Hop jams with our DJ crew Jam-On Productions. So, one of our DJs, Salvador Smooth, kept nagging me to do a rap song. Having come out of Hip-Hop street battles in Brooklyn in the ’70s, I didn&#x27;t really think much of the Rap records that were playing on the radio, so I figured as a joke I would make a parody jam ... I threw in an idea from an [event] that actually had happened in the ’70s, when a DJ who we had just blown out in a battle said to me &quot;Yeah, you guys are bad, but you can&#x27;t do this… wikki wikki wikki wikki,&quot; meaning how we didn&#x27;t scratch on the turntables. I used to play &quot;Jam-On&#x27;s Revenge&quot; at our parties and it would fill the dance floor, so even though I had never planned to release it, when I was shopping Positive Messenger for a deal I put it on the tape just to fill out space at the end. Turned out it ended up being the track that drove everybody crazy! So, we went with it and changed our names to Newcleus.&quot; 

A third release, &quot;Computer Age (Push the Button)&quot; reached the R&amp;B top 40. Newcleus released two albums in the mid-1980s, &quot;Jam on Revenge&quot; and &quot;Space Is the Place&quot;, although neither sold well. The Cenacs and the Craftons continued to record until 1989.

===Later years===
The group released several albums during the following years, but these were the creations of producers putting out material under the Newcleus name. Some of these featured classic Newcleus tracks touted as live versions (but simply added crowd noise atop the original tracks).

In 2005, Cozmo D released &quot;Destination Earth: The Definitive Newcleus Recordings&quot;, a collection of hip-hop tracks from the group&#x27;s entire catalog. This collection superseded the Rhino/Atlantic Records compilation &quot;Jam on This! The Best of Newcleus&quot;. The majority of the songs on this release were restored and remastered from the original master tapes. The definitive versions of the songs &quot;Destination Earth&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; taken from this CD were also released on 12-inch vinyl on the German record label Dominance Electricity. Together with remixes by Sbassship and Reeno, the cover illustrations are by Bill Wray (known for his work on the 1990s cult TV cartoon &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;).

Although the Newcleus albums &quot;Jam on Revenge&quot; and &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; were remastered and reissued on CD, the song &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beat&quot; from &quot;Jam on Revenge&quot; was removed from the track listing because Sunnyview insisted on including the track on the original album, even though it was not recorded nor produced by the group. These albums were previously available in the United States only on vinyl and audio cassette. However, both albums&#x27; original track listing and cover art were also available on CD, manufactured and distributed by Bellaphon Germany, under license from Sunnyview Records, in 1988.

Chilly B died at age 47 of a stroke on February 23, 2010.

==Media appearances==
&quot;Jam on It&quot; is heard in a Halloween party sequence in &quot;Blind&quot;, the first of non-fiction filmmaker Frederick Wiseman&#x27;s four films released in 1986 about the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind. It was also featured in the 1998 film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;.

Newcleus&#x27; songs have been used in several video games. &quot;Computer Age&quot; appears in &quot;Mat Hoffman&#x27;s Pro BMX&quot;, and &quot;Jam on It&quot; appears in both &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2&quot; and &quot;DJ Hero 2&quot;, the latter featuring a newly re-recorded version of the song.

<doc id="327423" wikidata="Q999964" url="?curid=327423" title="Alcor Life Extension Foundation">
<text>The Alcor Life Extension Foundation, most often referred to as Alcor, is an American nonprofit, federally tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization based in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States. Alcor advocates for, researches, and performs cryonics, the freezing of human corpses and brains in liquid nitrogen after legal death, with hopes of resurrecting and restoring them to full health if the technology to do so becomes available in the future. Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the scientific community and has been characterized as quackery and pseudoscience.

, Alcor had 1,927 members, including 222 who have died and whose corpses have been subject to cryonic processes; 116 bodies had only their head preserved. Alcor also applies its cryonic process to the bodies of pets. , there were 33 animal bodies preserved.

==History==
The organization was established as a nonprofit organization by Fred and Linda Chamberlain in California in 1972 as the Alcor Society for Solid State Hypothermia. Alcor was named after a faint star in the Big Dipper. The name was changed to Alcor Life Extension Foundation in 1977. The organization was conceived as a rational, technology-oriented cryonics organization that would be managed on a fiscally conservative basis. Alcor advertised in direct mailings and offered seminars in order to attract members and bring attention to the cryonics movement. The first of these seminars attracted 30 people.

On July 16, 1976, Alcor performed its first human cryopreservation on Fred Chamberlain&#x27;s father. That same year, research in cryonics began with initial funding provided by the Manrise Corporation. At that time, Alcor&#x27;s office consisted of a mobile surgical unit in a large van. Trans Time, Inc., a cryonics organization in the San Francisco Bay area, provided initial preservation procedures and long-term storage until Alcor began doing its own storage in 1982.

In 1977, articles of incorporation were filed in Indianapolis by the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies (IABS) and Soma, Inc. IABS was a nonprofit research startup led by a young cryonics enthusiast named Steve Bridge, while Soma was intended as a for-profit organization to provide cryopreservation and human storage services. Its president, Mike Darwin, subsequently became a president of Alcor. Bridge filled the same position many years later. IABS and Soma relocated to California in 1981. Soma was disbanded, while IABS merged with Alcor in 1982.

Alcor grew slowly in its early years. In 1984, it merged with the Cryonics Society of South Florida. Alcor counted only 50 members in 1985, which was the year it cryopreserved its third patient. However, during this time researchers associated with Alcor contributed some of the most important techniques related to cryopreservation, eventually leading to today&#x27;s method of vitrification.

Increasing growth in membership during this period is partially attributed to the 1986 publication of Eric Drexler&#x27;s &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, which debuted the idea of nanotechnology and contained a chapter on cryonics. In 1986, a group of Alcor members formed Symbex, a small investment company which funded a building in Riverside, California, for lease by Alcor. Alcor moved from Fullerton, California, to the new building in Riverside in 1987; Timothy Leary appeared at the grand opening. Alcor cryopreserved a member&#x27;s companion animal in 1986, and two people in 1987. Three human cases were handled in 1988, including the first whole body patient of Alcor&#x27;s, and one in 1989. At that time, Alcor owned 20% interest in Symbex, with a goal of 51% ownership. In September 1988, Leary announced that he had signed up with Alcor, becoming the first celebrity to become an Alcor member. Leary later switched to a different cryonics organization, CryoCare, and then changed his mind altogether. Alcor&#x27;s vice-president, director, head of suspension team and chief surgeon, Jerry Leaf, died suddenly of a heart attack in 1991.

By 1990, Alcor had grown to 300 members and outgrown its California headquarters, which was the largest cryonics facility in the world. The organization wanted to remain in Riverside County, but in response to concerns that the California facility was also vulnerable to earthquake risk, the organization purchased a building in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1993 and moved its stored bodies to it in 1994.

According to a 2007 &quot;Forbes&quot; profile, Canadian businessman Robert Miller, founder of Future Electronics, is a financial supporter of Alcor. and in 2013, that publication reported that he intends to be cryopreserved himself.

==Policies and procedures==

Most Alcor members fund cryonic preservation through life insurance policies which name Alcor as the beneficiary. Members who have signed up wear medical alert bracelets informing hospitals and doctors to notify Alcor in case of any emergency; in the case of a person who is known to be near death, Alcor can send a team for remote standby.

In some states, members can sign certificates stating that they wish to decline an autopsy. The cutting of the body organs (especially the brain) and blood vessels required for an autopsy makes it difficult to either preserve the body, especially the brain, without damage or perfuse the body with glycerol. The optimum preservation procedure begins less than one hour after death. Members can specify whether they wish Alcor to attempt to preserve even if an autopsy occurs, or whether they wish to be buried or cremated if an autopsy renders little hope for preservation.

In cases with remote standby, cardiopulmonary support is begun as soon as a patient is declared legally dead. Some patients were not able to receive cardiopulmonary support immediately, but their bodies have been preserved as well as possible. Alcor has a network of paramedics nationwide and seven surgeons, located in different regions, who are on call 24 hours a day. If an Alcor patient is met by a standby team (usually at a hospital, hospice, or home), the team will perform CPR to maintain blood flow to the brain and organs while simultaneously pumping an organ preservation solution through the veins.

Patients are transported as quickly as possible to Alcor headquarters in Scottsdale, where they undergo final preparations in Alcor&#x27;s cardiopulmonary bypass lab. In the Patient Care Bay they are monitored by computer sensors while kept in liquid nitrogen in dewars. Liquid nitrogen is refilled on a weekly basis. Riverside County, California deputy coroner Dan Cupido said that Alcor had better equipment than some medical facilities.

Membership dues cover one-third of Alcor&#x27;s yearly budget, with donations and case income from cryopreservations covering the rest. Alcor receives $50,000 each year from television royalties donated by sitcom writer and producer Richard C. Jones who is in suspension. In 1997, after a substantial effort led by then-president Steve Bridge, Alcor formed the Patient Care Trust as an entirely separate entity to manage and protect the funding for storage, including owning the building. Alcor remains the only cryonics organization to segregate and protect funding in this way; the 2% annual growth of the Trust is enough for upkeep of the patients. At least $115,000 of the money received for each full body goes into this trust for future storage, $25,000 for a brain. Some members have already taken steps to do this on their own.

==Stored corpses==
Stored corpses include those of Dick Clair, an Emmy Award-winning television sitcom writer and producer, Hall of Fame baseball legend Ted Williams and his son John Henry Williams, and futurist FM-2030.

Corpse storage has grown at a rate of about eight percent a year since Alcor&#x27;s inception, tripling between 1987 and 1990. The oldest stored body (by age at decease) is a 101-year-old woman, and the youngest is a 2-year-old girl. Alcor has had customers from Australia. One in four of its customers reside(d) in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Cases and controversies==

===Dora Kent===

Before the company moved to Arizona from Riverside, California, in 1994, it became a center of controversy when a county coroner ruled that Alcor client Dora Kent (Alcor board member Saul Kent&#x27;s mother) was murdered with barbiturates before her head was removed for preservation by the company&#x27;s staff. Alcor contended that the drug was administered after her death. No charges were ever filed; former Riverside County deputy coroner Alan Kunzman later said that this was due to mistakes and poor decision-making by others in his office.

A judge ruled that Kent was already deceased at the time of preservation, and no foul play was involved. Alcor sued the county for false arrest and illegal seizure and won both suits. The incident is credited with spurring a growth in membership for Alcor due to the resultant publicity.

===Ted Williams===
In 2002, Alcor drew considerable attention when baseball star Ted Williams was placed in cryonic suspension; although Alcor maintains privacy of its patients if they wish and did not disclose that Williams was at the Scottsdale facility, the situation came to light in court documents that grew out of an extended family dispute over Williams&#x27; wishes for his remains. While Williams&#x27; children Claudia and John Henry contended that Williams wished to be preserved at Alcor, their half-sister and oldest Williams child Bobby-Jo Ferrell contested that her father wished to be cremated. Williams&#x27; attorney produced a note signed by Williams, John Henry, and Claudia saying: &quot;JHW, Claudia and Dad all agree to be put into biostasis after we die. This is what we want, to be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.&quot; John Henry later said, &quot;He was very into science and believed in new technology and human advancement and was a pioneer. Even though things seemed impossible at times, he always knew there was always a chance to catch a fish – only if you had your fly in the water.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published allegations by former Alcor COO Larry Johnson that the company had mishandled Williams&#x27; head by drilling holes and accidentally cracking it. Johnson also claimed that some of Williams&#x27; DNA was missing; the article states that Williams&#x27; son, John Henry Williams, desired to sell some of his father&#x27;s DNA, a charge John Henry denied. Williams&#x27; attorney called the DNA allegations an &quot;absurd proposition&quot; and accused Johnson of trying to grab headlines. Alcor denied the allegations of missing DNA.

John Henry Williams subsequently died of leukemia, and his remains are also stored at Alcor. After John Henry&#x27;s death, Ferrell again filed a lawsuit, but representatives of Williams&#x27; estate repeated that he wished to be at Alcor.

In addition to his Williams allegations, Johnson handed over to the police a taped conversation in which he claimed that Alcor facilities engineer Hugh Hixon stated that an Alcor employee deliberately hastened the imminent death of a terminally ill AIDS patient in 1992 with an injection of Metubine, a paralytic drug. In 2009, Carlos Mondragon, Alcor&#x27;s CEO at the time, told ABC News he had been made aware of the allegations at the time of the case, and as a result had severed Alcor&#x27;s ties with the employee who allegedly hastened the patient&#x27;s death.

=== Mary Robbins lawsuit ===
Mary Robbins, a woman living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, signed up with Alcor in 2006, naming the organization as the beneficiary of a $50,000 annuity to cover the harvesting and storage expense. When she was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer in December 2009, she contacted Alcor to let them know. The company instructed her to move to Alcor&#x27;s headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, due to the &quot;lengthy list of after-death protocols that the company requires to prep the body for freezing, including administering a cocktail of medications&quot;. Because Robbins&#x27;s hospice was not able to carry out these procedures, her family said that she changed the beneficiary of the annuity from Alcor to her family. After a Colorado probate court judge ruled in favor of Alcor, they reached a settlement in which Alcor renounced claims on the annuity in exchange for Robbins&#x27;s remains.

===&quot;Alcor Life Extension Foundation v. Richardson&quot; (2010)===
When Alcor member Orville Richardson died in 2009, his two siblings, who served as co-conservators after he developed dementia, buried his remains even though they knew about his agreement with Alcor. Alcor sued them when they found out about Richardson&#x27;s death to have the body exhumed so his head could be preserved. Initially, a district court ruled against Alcor, but upon appeal, the Iowa Court of Appeals ordered Richardson&#x27;s remains be disinterred and transferred to the custody of Alcor a year after they had been buried in May 2010.

<doc id="327427" wikidata="Q1218601" url="?curid=327427" title="The Greatest Story Ever Told">
<text>The Greatest Story Ever Told is a 1965 American epic religious film that retells the Biblical account of Jesus of Nazareth, from the Nativity through to the Ascension. Produced and directed by George Stevens, the film features an ensemble cast and includes the final film performances of Claude Rains and Joseph Schildkraut.

The origins of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; trace back to a half-hour radio series in 1947, inspired by the four canonical Gospels. The series was later adapted into a 1949 novel by Fulton Oursler. In 1954, Twentieth Century Fox acquired the film rights to Oursler&#x27;s novel, but development stalled for several years. In November 1958, Stevens joined the project, agreeing to write and direct. However, in September 1961, Fox withdrew due to concerns over the film&#x27;s projected cost and its thematic similarities to &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), another religious biopic about Jesus.

A few months later, Stevens moved the project to United Artists. He opted to film in the Southwestern United States rather than the Middle East, and principal photography began on October 29, 1962. Filming fell behind schedule due to Stevens&#x27; meticulous shooting techniques, prompting David Lean and Jean Negulesco to assist with some sequences. Production concluded on August 1, 1963.

The film premiered at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City on February 15, 1965, receiving a polarized response from critics. It was also a box office disappointment, earning $15.5 million against a $20 million budget. Despite this, it received five Academy Award nominations.

==Plot==

===Part I===
The film opens with Three Wise Men following a celestial star to Jerusalem, seeking the prophesied newborn King of the Jews. Summoned by the paranoid King Herod, they reveal the Messiah’s birth, foretold to occur in Bethlehem. Herod secretly dispatches spies to track the child, but the Magi instead find Mary and Joseph in a humble stable, presenting gifts to their infant son, Jesus. Warned by an angel, the family flees to Egypt just before Herod orders the slaughter of Bethlehem’s male infants. Herod dies shortly after, and the family returns to Nazareth. 

Years later, Judea chafes under Roman rule. Herod Antipas, now tetrarch of Galilee, dismisses messianic hopes while the prophet John the Baptist preaches repentance at the Jordan River. Jesus, now an adult, arrives to be baptized by John, then retreats to the wilderness. There, he resists three temptations by a mysterious Dark Hermit, embodying spiritual evil. Returning to Galilee, Jesus gathers disciples—including fishermen Peter, Andrew, John, and the skeptical Judas Iscariot—promising to make them “fishers of men.” 

As Jesus teaches through parables and performs miracles like healing a crippled man, crowds grow. In Capernaum, he recruits the tax collector Matthew, while Pharisees and priests grow alarmed. Herodias, wife of Herod Antipas, manipulates her husband into arresting John the Baptist for denouncing her marriage as adulterous. Meanwhile, Jesus’s fame spreads: he spares Mary Magdalene from stoning, heals a hemorrhaging woman, and feeds 5,000 with scant loaves. 

In Nazareth, Jesus faces rejection when locals demand proof of his divinity. Later, he resurrects his friend Lazarus in Bethany, stunning onlookers and cementing fears among Jerusalem’s leaders. Herod, learning Jesus survived his father’s massacre, executes John and orders Jesus’s arrest.

===Part II===
Preparing for death, Jesus accepts anointing by Mary Magdalene, then rides into Jerusalem hailed as a king. Enraged by commercial desecration of the Temple, he drives out merchants, further alienating the Pharisees. At the Last Supper, Jesus predicts Judas’s betrayal and Peter’s denials, instituting the Eucharist. Judas flees to conspire with priests for thirty pieces of silver. 

Arrested in Gethsemane after Judas’s kiss, Jesus endures a biased trial before the Sanhedrin, where false witnesses, including the healed Aram, testify. Pontius Pilate, pressured by mobs, sends Jesus to Herod Antipas, who mocks him. Returned to Pilate, Jesus is condemned when crowds demand Barabbas’s release. Crucified alongside thieves Dimas and Gestas, Jesus forgives his executioners, entrusts Mary to John, and dies as darkness shrouds Golgotha. 

A guilt-ridden Judas dies by suicide, while Jesus’s body is entombed by Joseph of Arimathea. Guards seal the tomb, but on the third day, Jesus rises, appearing to disciples and Mary Magdalene. Though Thomas doubts, Jesus’s ascension to heaven culminates in the Great Commission, charging followers to spread his teachings. The film closes with the Hallelujah Chorus as Jesus’s image merges into celestial light.

==Cast==
Smaller credited roles (some appearing for only a few seconds) were played by Michael Ansara, Carroll Baker, Ina Balin, Robert Blake, Pat Boone, Victor Buono, John Considine, Richard Conte, John Crawford, Cyril Delevanti, Jamie Farr, David Hedison, Van Heflin, Russell Johnson, Angela Lansbury, Mark Lenard, Robert Loggia, John Lupton, Janet Margolin, Sal Mineo, Nehemiah Persoff, Marian Seldes, David Sheiner, Abraham Sofaer, Paul Stewart, Michael Tolan, John Wayne, and Shelley Winters. Richard Bakalyan and Marc Cavell, in uncredited roles, played the thieves crucified with Jesus.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; originated in 1947 as a U.S. radio series of half-hour episodes, written by Henry Denker and inspired by the four canonical Gospels. In 1949, the series was adapted into a novel by Fulton Oursler, a senior editor at &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. In May 1954, Darryl F. Zanuck, chairman of 20th Century Fox, acquired the film rights to Oursler&#x27;s novel for a down payment of $110,000, plus a percentage of the gross. Denker wrote a draft of the script, but the studio did not move the project into production. When Zanuck left the studio in 1956, the project was abandoned. In September 1958, Philip Dunne briefly became involved with the project, after signing on as a producer.

In November 1958, while George Stevens was filming &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959) at 20th Century Fox, he became aware that the studio owned the rights to the Oursler property. Stevens then founded a company, &quot;The Greatest Story Productions&quot;, to film the novel. The studio set an initial production budget of $10 million, twice the previous largest figure. That same month, another religious biopic titled &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961) was in development, helmed by producer Samuel Bronston. Spyros Skouras, the studio president of 20th Century Fox, had tried and failed to purchase the project from Bronston and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which had agreed to distribute the film. In June 1960, 20th Century Fox resigned from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), partly because of the similarity between the two films.

In June 1960, Denker sued Fox to reclaim the film rights and for $2.5 million of damages, claiming the studio had failed to release the film before the end of 1959. When Denker and Oursler&#x27;s estate sold the rights to Fox, Denker had placed a clause in the contract dictating the agreement. In September 1961, 20th Century Fox announced it had &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot; the project. Skouras refused to explain the reasons for canceling the project, but the decision was made after the studio had posted a $13 million loss in the previous year. &quot;Variety&quot; also reported that in the wake of the not-yet-released &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), starring Jeffrey Hunter as Jesus, several studio board members expressed concern about the eventual production costs. More than $1 million had already been spent on script preparation and there was no established filming date. The studio agreed to hand over the film rights to Stevens, and was contracted to recoup the costs should the film earn $5 million in profits. That same month, four American film studios—including Magna Theatre Corporation—and two in Europe made offers to finance the film. By November 1961, Stevens had moved the project to United Artists.

===Writing===
Before writing the screenplay, Stevens reviewed 36 different translations of the New Testament and compiled an extensive reference book with various clippings of scripture. Stevens and David Brown, a Fox executive, considered numerous screenwriters, including Ray Bradbury, Reginald Rose, William Saroyan, Joel Sayre, and Ivan Moffat. Stevens then met with Moffat at the Brown Derby, where Stevens told him his vision for the film would be reverent and universal. Stevens collaborated with him and then with James Lee Barrett. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed. It took two years to write the screenplay.

By July 1960, Carl Sandburg had been hired for completion work on the screenplay. Sandburg remained with the project for the next thirteen months, before returning to his residence in Flat Rock, North Carolina. In September 1961, Sandburg told &quot;Variety&quot; that he would continue to consult on the project &quot;until George Stevens tells me to stop&quot;. The contributions Sandburg made included a brief conversation between Judas Iscariot and Mary Magdalene discussing her use of expensive perfume to anoint Jesus. He received screen credit for &quot;creative association&quot;. Sandburg also had an uncredited appearance as a Roman citizen who glares at Pilate when he gives in to the crowd&#x27;s demand that he crucify Jesus. By November 1961, Stevens had finished writing the script.

Financial excesses grew during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist André Girard to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens traveled to the Vatican to see Pope John XXIII for advice.

===Casting===

For the role of Jesus, Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public. In February 1961, Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s dramatic films. Von Sydow said, &quot;I thought with horror of Cecil B. DeMille and such things as &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. But when I saw the script, I decided that the role of Jesus is absolutely not a religious cliché.&quot; It was reported that Elizabeth Taylor would portray Mary Magdalene, while Marlon Brando and Spencer Tracy were considered for the roles of Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate, respectively.

In major supporting roles, Dorothy McGuire was cast as Mary, the mother of Jesus; Robert Loggia as Joseph, the adoptive father of Jesus; Charlton Heston as John the Baptist, and Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate. Stevens asked Savalas to shave his head for the role; Savalas did so, and continued shaving his head for the rest of his life. &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; features an ensemble of well-known actors, many in brief, sometimes cameo, appearances; these included Pat Boone, Carroll Baker, David McCallum, Sidney Poitier, Angela Lansbury, Jose Ferrer, Martin Landau, Ed Wynn, and John Wayne as a Roman centurion.

An urban legend told of Wayne delivering his only spoken line in the film, &quot;Truly this man was the Son of God&quot; three times, none of which worked to Stevens&#x27;s satisfaction. Stevens advised, &quot;Can you give it a little more awe, Duke?&quot; Wayne then repeated: &quot;Aw, truly this man was the Son of God.&quot; In 1984, film critic Michael Medved and his brother Harry playfully noted: &quot;It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of &#x27;Spot the Star&#x27;, and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard &#x27;Walk of Fame&#x27;.&quot;

===Filming===
In late April 1960, Stevens, his son George Jr., and researcher Tony Van Renterghem spent six weeks scouting potential locations for filming in Europe and the Middle East. However, in 1965, Stevens told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Unfortunately some of the landscapes around Jerusalem were exciting, but many had been worn down through the years by erosion and man, invaders and wars, to places of less spectacular aspects.&quot; Stevens then decided to film in the United States, explaining: &quot;I wanted to get an effect of grandeur as a background to Christ, and none of the Holy Land areas shape up with the excitement of the American southwest. ... I know that Colorado is not the Jordan, nor is Southern Utah Palestine. But our intention is to romanticize the area, and it can be done better here.&quot;

Principal photography began on October 29, 1962, at the Crossing of the Fathers along the Colorado River. The first sequence shot was the baptism of Jesus. The Pyramid Lake in Nevada represented the Sea of Galilee, and Lake Moab in Utah was used to film the Sermon on the Mount. Death Valley in California was filmed for Jesus&#x27;s 40-day journey into the wilderness. Sections of the film were also shot at Lake Powell, Canyonlands and Dead Horse Point in Utah.

Filming was initially scheduled to last 20 weeks. However, filming fell behind schedule due to Stevens ordering more than 30 different camera setups and filming multiple takes of several scenes. Charlton Heston, who was portraying John the Baptist, explained, &quot;Stevens would do two or three [takes], but he would devise more different angles from which to cover than you&#x27;d think possible. You&#x27;d finish a day&#x27;s work on a scene confident that there was no other possible coverage, yet find yourself there a day or two longer while George explored further ideas.&quot; Meanwhile, interior studio filming was shot at the Desilu Culver Studios for nine weeks from June 6 to July 31, 1963. There, forty-seven sets were constructed to represent Jerusalem. In June 1963, cinematographer William C. Mellor died of a heart attack during production; Loyal Griggs, who had won an Academy Award for his cinematography on Stevens&#x27;s 1953 Western classic &quot;Shane&quot;, was brought in to replace him.

By the summer of 1963, Stevens had met with Arthur B. Krim, the chairman of United Artists, and agreed to allow other directors to direct several sequences so the film would be finished. Fred Zinnemann contacted David Lean, asking if he would consider directing second unit for two sequences. Lean accepted the offer, to which Stevens suggested he direct the Nativity scenes. Lean declined but he decided to direct the scenes with Herod the Great. Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod the Great. Jean Negulesco instead filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes.

Filming ended on August 1, 1963, where Stevens had shot over six million feet of Ultra Panavision 70 film. The final production budget had spent nearly $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ) plus additional editing and promotion charges, making it the most expensive film shot in the United States.

===Music===
Alfred Newman, who had previously scored &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959), composed the musical score, with the assistance of Ken Darby, his longtime collaborator and choral director. The protracted scoring process proved to be an unhappy one. Stevens, under pressure from his financers, made extensive late-stage changes to the edited footage. These edits altered the musical continuity and called for significant rewriting and reorchestration. Other composers, including Fred Steiner and Hugo Friedhofer, were called in to assist.

The post-release editing of the film further disrupted the musical composition. The twin climaxes of Newman&#x27;s score were his elaborate choral finales to Act 1 (the raising of Lazarus) and Act 2 (the Resurrection of Jesus). Stevens eventually substituted the Hallelujah Chorus from George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; for both sequences—a choice that was widely ridiculed by critics. The entire experience was recalled by David Raksin as &quot;the saddest story ever told&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; premiered February 15, 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City. It opened two days later at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles and then in Miami Beach. The film opened in Philadelphia and Detroit on March 9, 1965, and an edited version opened March 10, 1965, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. It also opened March 10 in Chicago, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh and in Boston on March 11. A shorter version was released in February 1967 for its general release in Chicago.

The version that premiered in New York had a running time of 221 to 225 minutes (excluding a 10-minute intermission) per reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;. The original running time was 4 hr 20 min (260 min).

Twenty-eight minutes were cut for the release of the film in Washington D.C. to tighten the film without deleting any scenes and these cuts were later made to the other prints. The film was edited further with a running time of 137 to 141 minutes for its general release in the United States. This shortened version removed Jesus&#x27;s 40-day journey into the wilderness, featuring Donald Pleasence as well as appearances by John Wayne and Shelley Winters.

===Marketing===
The marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary schools, and secondary schools. The Smithsonian Institution put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes, and photographs that toured museums around the country. Promotional items made available to groups identified for market segmentation included school study guides, children&#x27;s books, and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders, and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.

The film was advertised on its first run as being shown in Cinerama. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.

===Home media===
In 1993, the film was released on LaserDisc. The film was released on DVD in 2001, which featured a 3 hr 19 min (199 min) version along with a documentary called &quot;He Walks With Beauty&quot; (2011), which details the film&#x27;s tumultuous production history. In March 2011, the film was released on Blu-Ray, with the same runtime as the DVD version. The Blu-Ray version also contains a deleted extended scene during Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. In 2014, the film was added on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s Best of Family Collection on Blu Ray during their 90th Anniversary. 
==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as the &quot;world&#x27;s most conglomerate Biblical picture&quot; with &quot;scenes in which the grandeur of nature is brilliantly used to suggest the surge of the human spirit in waves of exaltation and awe.&quot; However, he felt the scenes of Jesus preaching to the multitude were too repetitive and &quot;[t]he most distracting nonsense is the pop-up of familiar faces in so-called cameo roles, jarring the illusion.&quot; Robert J. Landry of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a big, powerful moving picture demonstrating vast cinematic resource&quot;. He also praised von Sydow&#x27;s performance, writing he &quot;is a tower of strength and sensitivity&quot;. However, he felt Stevens was &quot;not particularly original in his approach to the galaxy of talent, some 60 roles,&quot; noting several prominent actors were underused in their cameo appearances. James Powers of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated: &quot;George Stevens has created a novel, reverent and important film with his view of this crucial event in the history of mankind.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Stevens has outdone himself by producing an austere Christian epic that offers few excitements of any kind ... &quot;Greatest Story&quot; is a lot less vulgar [than Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s Biblical films], though audiences are apt to be intimidated by its pretentious solemnity, which amounts to 3 hours and 41 minutes&#x27; worth of impeccable boredom. As for vigorous ideas, there are none that would seem new to a beginners&#x27; class in Bible study.&quot; Brendan Gill wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;If the subject matter weren&#x27;t sacred in the original, we would be responding to the picture in the most charitable way possible by laughing at it from start to finish; this Christian mercy being denied us, we can only sit and sullenly marvel at the energy for which, for more than four hours, the note of serene vulgarity is triumphantly sustained. Shana Alexander, reviewing for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, stated: &quot;The scale of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; was so stupendous, the pace was so stupefying that I felt not uplifted but sandbagged.&quot; John Simon wrote: &quot;God is unlucky in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. His only begotten son turns out to be a bore.&quot;

In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stevens stated, &quot;I have tremendous satisfaction that the job has been done – to its completion – the way I wanted it done; the way I know it should have been done. It belongs to the audiences now ... and I prefer to let them judge.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 42% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10.

===Box office===
Three weeks after opening at the Warner Cinerama, the film had earned nearly $250,000 in advance ticket sales. Based on the ticket sales and advanced reserve-seating ticket sales before Easter, Eugene Picker, United Artists vice president, told &quot;Variety&quot; that the film &quot;was way ahead of any other previous UA hard-tickets being used up for each group and window sales.&quot; One year into its release, the film had earned $12.1 million worldwide, being equally split across domestic and international territories. However, this was far less than the $35–38 million gross needed to break even.

Months after the film&#x27;s release, United Artists wrote-off 60 percent of the film&#x27;s negative cost. They later recouped the cost by selling the television rights to NBC for $5 million, in which the film was broadcast for perennial viewing during Easter and Christmastime. Steven D. Greydanus, a film critic for the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, believed the film&#x27;s inability to connect with audiences discouraged future productions of biblical epics for decades.

===Awards===
Though it received a poor reception from some critics, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards:

<text>Israel Kaʻanoʻi Kamakawiwoʻole (May 20, 1959 – June 26, 1997), also called Braddah IZ or just simply IZ, was a Native Hawaiian musician and singer. Kamakawiwoʻole is regarded as one of the greatest musicians from Hawaii and is considered the most successful musician from the state. Along with his ukulele playing and incorporation of other genres, such as jazz and reggae, Kamakawiwoʻole remains influential on Hawaiian music. In 2010, he was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR, who called him &quot;The Voice of Hawaii&quot;.

He achieved commercial success and mainstream popularity with his 1993 studio album, &quot;Facing Future&quot;. His medley of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; from his album &quot;Ka ʻAnoʻi&quot; (1990), has spent 358 weeks on top of the World Digital Songs chart, making it the longest-leading number-one hit on any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; song charts.

== Early life ==
Israel Kaʻanoʻi Kamakawiwoʻole was born at Kuakini Medical Center on May 20, 1959, in Honolulu to Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Kaleialoha Naniwa Kamakawiwoʻole Jr. and Evangeline &quot;Angie&quot; Leinani Kamakawiwoʻole, who worked at a popular Waikiki nightclub. His mother was the manager while his father was a bouncer; his father also drove a sanitation truck at the U.S. Navy shipyard at Pearl Harbor. The notable Hawaiian musician Moe Keale was Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s uncle and a major musical influence. Kamakawiwoʻole was raised in the community of Kaimuki, where his parents had met and married.

Kamakawiwoʻole began playing music with his older brother, Henry Kaleialoha Naniwa Kamakawiwoʻole III (&quot;Skippy&quot;), and cousin Allen Thornton, at age 11 after being exposed to the music of Hawaiian entertainers of the time such as Peter Moon, Palani Vaughan, Keola Beamer and Don Ho, who frequented the establishment where Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s parents worked. Hawaiian musician Del Beazley spoke of the first time he heard Kamakawiwoʻole perform, when, while playing for a graduation party, the whole room fell silent on hearing him sing. Kamakawiwoʻole remained in Hawaii as his brother Skippy entered the Army in 1971 and his cousin Allen moved to the mainland in 1976.

In his early teens, Kamakawiwoʻole studied at Upward Bound (UB) of the University of Hawaii at Hilo and his family moved to Mākaha. There, Kamakawiwoʻole met Louis Kauakahi, Sam Gray, and Jerome Koko. Together with Skippy, they formed the Makaha Sons of Niʻihau. A part of the Hawaiian Renaissance, the band&#x27;s blend of contemporary and traditional styles gained in popularity as they toured Hawaii and the mainland United States, releasing fifteen successful albums. Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s aim was to make music that stayed true to the typical sound of traditional Hawaiian music. His cousin Bill Keale is also a musician.

== Music career ==
The Makaha Sons of Niʻihau recorded &quot;No Kristo&quot; in 1976 and released several more albums, including &quot;Hoʻoluana&quot;, &quot;Kahea O Keale&quot;, &quot;Keala&quot;, &quot;Makaha Sons of Niʻihau&quot; and &quot;Mahalo Ke Akua&quot;.

The group became Hawaii&#x27;s most popular contemporary traditional group with breakout albums 1984&#x27;s &quot;Puana Hou Me Ke Aloha&quot; and its follow-up, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Hoʻola&quot;. Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s last recorded album with the group was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Hoʻoluana&quot;. It remains the group&#x27;s top-selling CD. In 1982, Skippy died at age 28 of a heart attack. Later that year, Kamakawiwoʻole married his childhood sweetheart Marlene. They had a daughter named Ceslie-Ann &quot;Wehi&quot; Kamakawiwoʻole (born ).

In 1990, Kamakawiwoʻole released his first solo album &quot;Ka ʻAnoʻi&quot;, which won awards for Contemporary Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year from the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts (HARA). &quot;Facing Future&quot; was released in 1993 by The Mountain Apple Company. It featured a version of his most popular song, the medley &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; (listed as &quot;Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot;), along with &quot;Hawaiʻi &#x27;78&quot;, &quot;White Sandy Beach&quot;, &quot;Maui Hawaiian Sup&#x27;pa Man&quot;, and &quot;Kaulana Kawaihae&quot;. The decision to include a cover of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; was said to be a last-minute one by Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s producer Jon de Mello and Kamakawiwoʻole. &quot;Facing Future&quot; debuted at No.25 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Pop Catalogue chart. On October 26, 2005, &quot;Facing Future&quot; became Hawaiʻi&#x27;s first certified platinum album, selling more than a million CDs in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. On July 21, 2006, BBC Radio 1 announced that &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World (True Dreams)&quot; would be released as a single in America.

In 1994, Kamakawiwoʻole was voted favorite entertainer of the year by the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts (HARA). &quot;E Ala E&quot; (1995) featured the political title song &quot;ʻE Ala ʻE&quot; and &quot;Kaleohano&quot;, and &quot;N Dis Life&quot; (1996) featured &quot;In This Life&quot; and &quot;Starting All Over Again&quot;.

In 1997, Kamakawiwoʻole was again honored by HARA at the annual Na Hoku Hanohano Awards for Male Vocalist of the Year, Favorite Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year, and Island Contemporary Album of the Year. He watched the awards ceremony from a hospital room.

The posthumously released album &quot;Alone in Iz World&quot; (2001) debuted at No.1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; World Chart and No.135 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top200, No.13 on the Top Independent Albums Chart, and No.15 on the Top Internet Album Sales charts. In November 2012, &quot;Honolulu&quot; magazine ranked it as the third-greatest Hawaii album of the 21st century.

Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s album &quot;Facing Future&quot; was the first Hawaii album to be certified gold.

== Support of Hawaiian rights ==
Kamakawiwoʻole was known for promoting Hawaiian rights and Hawaiian independence, both through his lyrics, which often stated the case for independence directly and through his own actions. For example, the lyric in his song &quot;Hawaiʻi &#x27;78&quot;: &quot;The life of this land is the life of the people/and that to care for the land (malama ʻāina) is to care for the Hawaiian culture&quot;, is a statement that many consider summarizing his Hawaiian ideals. The state motto of Hawaiʻi is a recurring line in the song and encompasses the meaning of his message: &quot;Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono&quot; (proclaimed by King Kamehameha III when Hawaiʻi regained sovereignty in 1843. It can be roughly translated as: &quot;The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness&quot;).

Kamakawiwoʻole used his music to promote awareness of his belief that a second-class status had been pushed onto fellow natives by the tourism industry.

== Later life ==
In the 1990s, Kamakawiwoʻole became a born-again Christian. In 1996, he was baptized at the Word of Life Christian Center in Honolulu and spoke publicly about his beliefs at the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards. Kamakawiwoʻole also recorded the song &quot;Ke Alo O Iesu&quot; ().

== Death ==
Kamakawiwoʻole struggled with obesity throughout his life, at one point weighing while standing tall. Kamakawiwoʻole endured several hospitalizations because of his weight. With chronic medical problems including respiratory and cardiac issues, Kamakawiwoʻole died at age 38 in the Queen&#x27;s Medical Center in Honolulu at 12:18 a.m. on June 26, 1997, from respiratory failure.

On July 10, 1997, the Hawaiian flag flew at half-staff for Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s funeral. His koa wood casket lay at the state capitol building in Honolulu, making him the third person (and the only non-government official) to be so honored. Approximately 10,000 people attended his funeral. Thousands of fans gathered as his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean at Mākua Beach on July 12. According to witnesses, many people commemorated him by honking their car and truck horns on all Hawaiian highways that day. Scenes from the funeral and scattering of Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s ashes were featured in official music videos of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, released posthumously by Mountain Apple Company. , the two official video uploads of the song, as featured on YouTube by Mountain Apple Company Inc, have collectively received over 1.63 billion views.

On September 20, 2003, hundreds paid tribute to Kamakawiwoʻole as a bronze bust of him was unveiled at the Waianae Neighborhood Community Center on Oʻahu. His widow, Marlene Kamakawiwoʻole, and sculptor Jan-Michelle Sawyer were present for the dedication ceremony.

== Legacy ==
On December 6, 2010, NPR named Kamakawiwoʻole as &quot;The Voice of Hawaii&quot; in its 50 great voices series.

On March 24, 2011, Kamakawiwoʻole was honored with the German national music award Echo. The music managers Wolfgang Boss and Jon de Mello accepted the trophy in his stead.

A 2014 Pixar short film, &quot;Lava&quot;, features two volcanoes as the main characters. Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s cover of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; and his style of music were James Ford Murphy&#x27;s partial inspiration for the short film.

On May 20, 2020, Google Doodle published a page in celebration of Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s 61st birthday. It featured information about his life, musical career, and impact on Hawaii. Included was a two-minute cartoon video with Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s cover of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; playing as the background and imagery of Hawaii. The section of the page explaining the inspiration of the Doodle says that &quot;The Doodle is full of places in Hawaiʻi that had special significance for Israel: the sunrise at Diamond Head, Mākaha Beach, the Palehua vista, the flowing lava and volcanic landscape of the Big Island, the black sand beach at Kalapana and the Waiʻanae coast.&quot;

=== &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; ===

Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s recording of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; gained notice in 1999 when an excerpt was used in the TV commercials for eToys.com (later part of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us). The full song was featured in the movies &quot;K-Pax&quot;, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;, &quot;Son of the Mask&quot;, &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, &quot;Fred Claus&quot;, &quot;Letters to Santa&quot; and &quot;IMAX: Hubble 3D&quot;. It was also featured in TV series &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Between The Lions&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Storm Chasers&quot;, the UK original version of &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, and in &quot;Modern Family&quot;, among others.

In 1988, a friend of Kamakawiwoʻole called a Honolulu recording studio owned by Milan Bertosa at 3:00 a.m. with a request that Kamakawiwoʻole be allowed to come in to make a recording. Bertosa was about to shut down, but told the friend that Kamakawiwoʻole could come if he was able to make it within 15 minutes. In a 2011 interview, Bertosa recalled, &quot;In walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on.&quot; A security guard gave Kamakawiwoʻole a large steel chair. &quot;Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is &#x27;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&#x27; He played and sang, one take, and it was over.&quot; Five years later, Bertosa was working as an engineer at Mountain Apple Company when Iz was making a solo album there. Bertosa remembered the old demo tape and introduced it to de Mello, who remarked: &quot;Israel was really sparkly, really alive.&quot; The original 1988 acoustic version of the song was released with the 1993 &quot;Facing Future&quot; album.

&quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; reached No.12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Digital Tracks chart the week of January 31, 2004 (for the survey week ending January 18, 2004). It had passed two million paid downloads in the US by September 27, 2009, and then sold three million in the U.S. as of October 2, 2011. And, as of October 2014, the song has sold more than 4.2 million digital copies. The song is the longest-leading number-one hit on any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; song charts, having spent 358 weeks on top of the World Digital Songs chart.

On July 8, 2007, Kamakawiwoʻole debuted at No.44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top200 Album Chart with &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, selling 17,000 units.

In April 2007, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; entered the UK charts at No.68, and eventually climbed to No.46, spending ten weeks in the Top100 over a two-year period.

In October 2010, following its use in a trailer for the TV channel VOX and on a TV advertisement—for Axe deodorant (which is itself a revival of the advertisement originally aired in 2004)—it hit No.1 on the German singles chart, was the number-one seller single of 2010 and was eventually certified 2× Platinum in 2011.

As of November 1, 2010, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; peaked at No.6 on the OE3 Austria charts, which largely reflects airplay on Austria&#x27;s government-operated Top40 radio network. It also peaked at No.1 in France and Switzerland in late December 2010.

On December 21, 2020, the official music video for &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; reached a billion views on YouTube.

In 2021, the song was inducted into the National Recording Registry as part of the heritage in American recorded sound.

Edward Howard was born in Cresco, Iowa, to John and Marie (née Fleming) Howard. His father, who was born in Ireland but immigrated to the United States as a child, served during the Civil War with the 95th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was wounded at the Siege of Vicksburg. Howard had a twin brother who died in infancy. He attended St. Joseph College in Dubuque, where he received his high school education and completed two years of college. He continued his studies at St. Mary College in Kansas and at St. Paul Seminary in Minnesota.

==Priesthood==
Howard was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Ireland on June 12, 1906. He then returned to St. Joseph College, where he served as professor of Greek and Latin at the high school department. He served as principal of the high school from 1908 until 1916, when he became dean of the college. From 1921 to 1924, he served as president of St. Joseph&#x27;s.

==Episcopacy==
On December 23, 1923, Howard was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Davenport and titular bishop of &quot;Isaura&quot; by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on April 8, 1924, from Archbishop Austin Dowling, with Bishops Daniel Gorman and Thomas Drumm serving as co-consecrators, at St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral in Dubuque. As an auxiliary bishop, he assisted Bishop James J. Davis for two years.

Following the death of Archbishop Alexander Christie, Howard was appointed the fifth Archbishop of Oregon City on April 30, 1926. His installation took place at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Portland on August 26 of that year. On September 26, 1928, the name of the archdiocese was changed from &quot;Oregon City&quot; to &quot;Portland in Oregon&quot;. During his tenure as archbishop, Howard created a chancery in the cathedral rectory, later transferring it to a separate building. He reorganized the St. Vincent de Paul and Holy Name Societies, fostered the growth of Catholic Charities, and removed the &quot;Catholic Sentinel&quot; from private ownership.

In 1931, Howard led a successful campaign to repeal local zoning ordinances that prohibited the building of churches and parochial schools. He convened the Fourth Provincial Council of the archdiocese in 1932, and held a synod for the clergy in 1935. In 1939, he founded Central Catholic High School in Portland and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne by Pope Pius XII in 1939. He convened the Fifth Provincial Council of the archdiocese in 1957, and attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965.

==Later life and death==
After forty years as archbishop, Howard retired on December 9, 1966; he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Albulae by Pope Paul VI on the same date. He served as Apostolic Administrator of the archdiocese until the installation of his successor, Robert Joseph Dwyer.

Howard spent his retirement at Maryville Nursing Home in Beaverton, where he died at age 105. He is interred at Mount Calvary Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was the oldest Catholic prelate in the world.

<text>The California Republic, or Bear Flag Republic, was an unrecognized breakaway state from Mexico, that for 25 days in 1846 militarily controlled an area north of San Francisco, in and around what is now Sonoma County in California.

In June 1846, thirty-three American immigrants in Alta California who had entered without official permission rebelled against the Mexican department&#x27;s government. Among their grievances were that they had not been allowed to buy or rent land and had been threatened with expulsion. Mexican officials had been concerned about a coming war with the United States and the growing influx of Americans into California. The rebellion was covertly encouraged by U.S. Army Brevet Captain John C. Frémont, and added to the troubles of the recent outbreak of the Mexican–American War.

The name &quot;California Republic&quot; appeared only on the flag the insurgents raised in Sonoma. It indicated their aspiration of forming a republican government under their control. The rebels elected military officers but no civil structure was ever established. Their flag, featuring a silhouette of a California grizzly bear, became known as the &quot;Bear Flag&quot; and was later the basis for the official state flag of California.

Three weeks later, on July 5, 1846, the Republic&#x27;s military of 100 to 200 men was subsumed into the California Battalion commanded by Brevet Captain John C. Frémont. The Bear Flag Revolt and what remained of the California Republic ceased to exist on July 9 when U.S. Navy Lieutenant Joseph Revere raised the United States flag in front of the Sonoma Barracks and sent a second flag to be raised at Sutter&#x27;s Fort.

==Background of the Bear Flag Revolt==

===Alta California&#x27;s Governance===
By 1845–46, Alta California had been largely neglected by Mexico for the twenty-five years since Mexican independence. It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among Californios about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. In 1845, the widely hated Manuel Micheltorena, the latest governor to be sent by Mexico, was forcefully ejected by the Californians. His forces were defeated at the Battle of Providencia (also known as the Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass) as a result of the actions of California pioneer John Marsh. This resulted in the return of Californian Pio Pico to the governorship. Pico ruled the region south of San Luis Obispo with his capital in &quot;The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porciúncula River&quot;, now known as Los Angeles. The area to the north of the pueblo of San Luis Obispo was under the control of Alta California&#x27;s &quot;Commandante&quot; José Castro with headquarters near Monterey, the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the Customhouse. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.

Decrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice. By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.

===Texas, immigration and land===
The relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time. The Republic of Texas, which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845. Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened. James K. Polk was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.

Mexican law had long allowed grants of land to naturalized Mexican citizens. Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land. That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California. The orders also required California&#x27;s officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California. All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.

Alta California&#x27;s Sub-Prefect Francisco Guerrero had written to U.S. Consul Thomas O. Larkin that:
During November 1845, California&#x27;s &quot;Commandante General&quot; José Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter&#x27;s Fort. In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: &quot;Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department&quot; with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.

===Captain Frémont in California===
A 62-man exploring and mapping expedition entered California in late 1845 under the command of U.S. Army Brevet Captain John C. Frémont. Frémont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator Thomas Hart Benton. Early in 1846 Frémont acted provocatively with California&#x27;s &quot;Commandante General&quot; José Castro near the pueblo of Monterey and then moved his group out of California into Oregon Country. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt Archibald H. Gillespie who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul Thomas O. Larkin and instructions to share the message with Frémont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Frémont&#x27;s wife and father-in-law.

Frémont&#x27;s thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: &quot;I saw the way opening clear before me. War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the Sacramento valley in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.&quot; Nevertheless, Frémont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face court-martial for violating the Neutrality Act of 1794 that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Frémont&#x27;s group departed for California. Frémont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near Sutter Buttes.

===USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; in the San Francisco Bay===
U.S. Consul Thomas O. Larkin, concerned about the increasing possibility of war, sent a request to Commodore John D. Sloat of U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron, for a warship to protect U.S. citizens and interests in Alta California. In response, the arrived at Monterey on April 22, 1846. After receiving information about Frémont&#x27;s returning to California, Consul Larkin and &quot;Portsmouth&#x27;s&quot; captain John Berrien Montgomery decided the ship should move into the San Francisco Bay. She sailed from Monterey on June 1.

Lt. Gillespie, having returned from the Oregon Country and his meeting with Frémont on June 7, found &quot;Portsmouth&quot; moored at Sausalito. He carried a request for money, materiel and supplies for Frémont&#x27;s group. The requested resupplies were taken by the ship&#x27;s launch up the Sacramento River to a location near Frémont&#x27;s camp.

==Bear Flag Revolt==
===Settlers meet with Frémont===
William B. Ide, a future leader of the Revolt, writes of receiving an unsigned written message on June 8, 1846: &quot;Notice is hereby given, that a large body of armed Spaniards on horseback, amounting to 250 men, have been seen on their way to the Sacramento Valley, destroying crops and burning houses, and driving off the cattle. Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his&quot; – (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found). Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Frémont&#x27;s camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Frémont any definite promise of aid.

===Taking of government horses===
Some of the group who had been meeting with Frémont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by &quot;Californio&quot; soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian &quot;Commandante General&quot;, José Castro, in Santa Clara. It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California. The captured horses were taken to Frémont&#x27;s new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.

These men next determined to seize the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Sonoma to deny the &quot;Californios&quot; a rallying point north of San Francisco Bay. Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned Presidio of Sonoma and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo would delay any military response from the &quot;Californios&quot;. The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel &quot;Stuttering Zeke&quot; Merritt, whom Frémont described as his &quot;field-lieutenant&quot; and lauded for not questioning him.

===Capture of Sonoma===

Historian George Tays has cautioned &quot;The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors. No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.&quot; Historian H. H. Bancroft has written that Frémont &quot;instigated and planned&quot; the horse raid, and incited the American settlers indirectly and &quot;guardedly&quot; to revolt.

Before dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over 30 American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley. A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont&#x27;s camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached &quot;Comandante&quot; Vallejo&#x27;s home and pounded on his door. After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform. Communication was not good until American Jacob P. Leese (Vallejo&#x27;s brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.

Vallejo then invited the filibusters&#x27; leaders into his home to negotiate terms. Two other Californio officers and Leese joined the negotiations. The insurgents waiting outside sent elected &quot;captains&quot; John Grigsby and William Ide inside to speed the proceedings. The effect of Vallejo&#x27;s hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else&#x27;s barrel of &quot;aguardiente&quot; for those outside is debatable. However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it. Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages. John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Frémont. William Ide gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic. Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with &quot;Choose ye this day what you will be! We are robbers, or we &quot;must&quot; be conquerors!&quot;

At that time, Vallejo and his three associates were placed on horseback and taken to Frémont accompanied by eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic under the circumstances. That night they camped at the Vaca Rancho. Some young Californio &quot;vigilantes&quot; under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape. Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Frémont would release him on parole.

The Sonoma Barracks became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the &quot;Bear Flag&quot; section below). After the flag was raised Californios called the insurgents &quot;Los Osos&quot; (The Bears) and &quot;Bear Flaggers&quot; because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance. The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the &quot;Popular Movement&quot;, became known as the &quot;Bear Flag Revolt&quot;. Henry L. Ford was elected First Lieutenant of the company and obtained promises of obedience to orders. Samuel Kelsey was elected Second Lieutenant, Grandville P. Swift and Samuel Gibson Sergeants.

===Ide&#x27;s proclamation ===
During the night of June 14–15, 1846 (below), William B. Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt. There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.

===Need for gunpowder===
A major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient gunpowder to defend against the expected Mexican attack. William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter to be delivered to the USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as &quot;fellow country men&quot;. Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder. Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country&#x27;s neutrality. Todd, José de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth&#x27;s launch the morning of the 16th. Misroon&#x27;s mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.

Todd was given a second assignment. He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes called &#x27;the Englishman&#x27;) to obtain powder from American settlers in that area. On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to &quot;Rancho Sotoyome&quot; (near current-day Healdsburg, California) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Frémont&#x27;s scout Kit Carson.

===Sutter&#x27;s Fort===
Frémont&#x27;s &quot;field-lieutenant&quot; Merritt returned to Sacramento (known as New Helvetia at the time, so named by the Swiss John Sutter) on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Frémont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the &quot;Californio&quot; officers as hostages. He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo&#x27;s brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in Sutter&#x27;s Fort. Frémont recounts in his memoirs, &quot;Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction … I knew the facts of the situation. These I could not make known, but felt warranted in assuming the responsibility and acting on my own knowledge.&quot;

Frémont&#x27;s artist and cartographer on his third expedition, Edward Kern, was placed in command of Sutter&#x27;s Fort and its company of dragoons by Frémont. That left John Sutter the assignment as lieutenant of the dragoons at $50 a month, and second in command of his own fort.

While in command there news of the stranded Donner Party reached Kern; Sutter&#x27;s Fort had been their unreached destination. Kern vaguely promised the federal government would do something for a rescue party across the Sierra, but had no authority to pay anyone. He was later criticized for his mismanagement delaying the search.

===Castro&#x27;s response===
Word of the taking of the government horses, the capture of Sonoma, and the imprisonment of the Mexican officers at Sutter&#x27;s Fort soon reached &quot;Commandante General&quot; José Castro at his headquarters in Santa Clara. He issued two proclamations on June 17. The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country. The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt. A group of 50–60 militia under command of Captain Joaquin de la Torre traveled up to San Pablo and, by boat, westward across the San Francisco Bay to Point San Quentin on the 23rd. Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.

===Battle of Olúmpali===
On June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to &quot;Rancho Sotoyome&quot;. Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them. From the prisoner they learned that Cowie and Fowler had died. There are Californio and &quot;Oso&quot; versions of what had happened. Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the Californio irregulars led by Juan Padilla and José Ramón Carrillo.

Ford writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla&#x27;s men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma. Ide&#x27;s version is that Ford wrote to Frémont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide&#x27;s leadership. In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears. Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near Two Rock. The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the Rancho Laguna de San Antonio and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla&#x27;s group near the Indian rancho of Olúmpali. Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came &quot;pouring out of the adobe&quot;. Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla&#x27;s irregulars and now numbered about seventy. Ford&#x27;s men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing long-range battle, William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael. A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears. This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.

The deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the Sonoma Barracks. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred. Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.

===Frémont arrives to defend Sonoma===
Having learned of Ford&#x27;s request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Frémont left his camp near Sutter&#x27;s Fort for Sonoma on June 23. With him were ninety men – his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley. Frémont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law Thomas Hart Benton in case the government should wish to disavow his action. They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to San Rafael accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford&#x27;s command. They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished. The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.

On Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay. Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it. It held twin brothers Francisco and Ramón de Haro, their uncle José de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) – all unarmed. The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission. All three were shot and killed. Beyond that almost every fact is disputed. Some say Frémont ordered the killings. Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre. Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Frémont&#x27;s Delaware Indians. This incident became an issue in Frémont&#x27;s later campaign for President. Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.

===Captain de la Torre&#x27;s ruse===
Late the same afternoon as the killings, a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning. Frémont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible. The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Frémont and Ford&#x27;s forces approached Sonoma – almost provoking firing by the garrison. Frémont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast. He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat. Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape but almost succeeded in provoking a &#x27;friendly fire&#x27; incident among the insurgents.

After reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned. All three of Castro&#x27;s divisions then returned to the old headquarters near Santa Clara where a council of war was held on June 30. It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces. A messenger was sent to the Governor. Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to San Juan where General Castro was, on July 6, when he learned of the events in Monterey.

===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===
On July 1, Frémont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the &quot;Moscow&quot;″s launch to the old Spanish fort at the entrance to the Golden Gate. They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon. The next day Robert B. Semple led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of Yerba Buena (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port. Ridley was sent to Sutter&#x27;s Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.

===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===

A great celebration was held on the Fourth of July beginning with readings of the United States Declaration of Independence in Sonoma&#x27;s plaza. There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages. Frémont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the fandango held in Salvador Vallejo&#x27;s big adobe on the corner of the town square.

===Formation of the California Battalion===

On July 5, Frémont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit. He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the California Battalion signed or made their marks. A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Frémont to &quot;begin at the beginning&quot;.

The next day Frémont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter&#x27;s Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle. The seven-ton &quot;Mermaid&quot; was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter&#x27;s Fort.

===U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps capture Monterey===
The war against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846. Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively. (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.) Commodore John D. Sloat, commanding the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron, had been waiting in Monterey Bay since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war. Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May. He was also acutely aware of the 1842 Capture of Monterey, when his predecessor, Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day. This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.

Sloat had learned of Frémont&#x27;s confrontation with the Californios on Gavilan Peak and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma. He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie&#x27;s tracking down of Frémont with letters and orders. Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul Larkin, &quot;I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much – I prefer the latter.&quot; Early July 7, the frigate USS &quot;Savannah&quot; and the two sloops, USS &quot;Cyane&quot; and USS &quot;Levant&quot; of the United States Navy, captured Monterey, California, and raised the flag of the United States. Sloat had his proclamation read in and posted in English and Spanish: &quot;...henceforth California will be a portion of the United States&quot;.

===Conclusion and aftermath===
Two days later, July 9, the Bear Flag Revolt and whatever remained of the &quot;California Republic&quot; ended when Navy Lieutenant Joseph Revere was sent to Sonoma from the USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot;, which had been berthed at Sausalito, carrying two 27-star United States flags, one for Sonoma and the other for Sutter&#x27;s Fort (the squadron had run out of new 28-star flags that reflected Texas&#x27; admittance to the Union). The Bear Flag that was taken down that day was given to the Clerk of the &quot;Portsmouth&quot;, John Elliott Montgomery, the son of Commander John B. Montgomery. John E. wrote to his mother later in July that &quot;Cuffy came down growling&quot;. The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the Secretary of the Navy. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco. The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the Sonoma Barracks.

==Bear Flag==
The most notable legacy of the &quot;California Republic&quot; was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state Flag of California. The flag has a star, a grizzly bear, and a red stripe with the words &quot;California Republic&quot;. The &quot;Bear Flag Monument&quot; on the Sonoma Plaza, site of the raising of the original Bear Flag, is marked by a California Historical Landmark #7.

The design and creation of the original Bear Flag used in the Bear Flag Revolt is often credited to Peter Storm. The flags were made about one week before the storming of Sonoma, when William Todd and his companions claim to have made theirs, apparently based on Mr. Storm&#x27;s first flags.

In 1878, at the request of the Los Angeles &quot;Evening Express&quot;, William L. Todd (1818–1879) wrote an account of the Bear Flag used at the storming of Sonoma, perhaps the first to be raised. Soon after, his implementation became the basis for the first official State flag. Todd acknowledged the contributions of other &quot;Osos&quot; to the flag, including Granville P. Swift, Peter Storm, and Henry L. Ford in an 1878 newspaper article. Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length. It featured a red star based on the California Lone Star Flag that was flown during California&#x27;s 1836 revolt led by Juan Alvarado and Isaac Graham. The flag also featured an image of a grizzly bear statant (standing), as opposed to the original flag, which showed it salient (leaping) or rampant (rearing up). The modern flag shows the bear passant (walking).

<text>Compassion is a social feeling that motivates people to go out of their way to relieve the physical, mental, or emotional pains of others and themselves. Compassion is sensitivity to the emotional aspects of the suffering of others. When based on notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered partially rational in nature.

Compassion involves &quot;feeling for another&quot; and is a precursor to empathy, the &quot;feeling as another&quot; capacity (as opposed to sympathy, the &quot;feeling towards another&quot;). In common parlance, active compassion is the desire to alleviate another&#x27;s suffering.

Compassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is one that is intended to be helpful. Other virtues that harmonize with compassion include patience, wisdom, kindness, perseverance, warmth, and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in altruism. The difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to others&#x27; suffering with sorrow and concern whereas the latter responds with warmth and care. An article in &quot;Clinical Psychology Review&quot; suggests that &quot;compassion consists of three facets: noticing, feeling, and responding&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The English noun compassion, meaning &quot;to suffer together with&quot;, comes from Latin. Its prefix &quot;com-&quot; comes directly from , an archaic version of the Latin preposition and affix (= with); the &quot;-passion&quot; segment is derived from , past participle of the deponent verb . Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun patient (= one who suffers), from , present participle of the same , and is akin to the Greek verb (, to suffer) and to its cognate noun (= ). Ranked a great virtue in numerous philosophies, compassion is considered in almost all the major religious traditions as among the greatest of virtues.

== Theories on conceptualizing compassion ==
Theoretical perspectives show contrasts in their approaches to compassion.
:* Compassion is simply a variation of love or sadness, not a distinct emotion.
:* From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, compassion can be viewed as a distinct emotional state, which can be differentiated from distress, sadness, and love.
:* Compassion is, however, a synonym of empathic distress, which is characterized by the feeling of distress in connection with another person&#x27;s suffering. This perspective of compassion is based on the finding that people sometimes emulate and feel the emotions of people around them.
:* According to Thupten Jinpa, compassion is a &quot;sense of concern&quot; that arises in us in the face of someone who is in need or someone who is in pain. It is accompanied by a kind of a wishing (i.e. desire) to see the relief or end of that situation, along with wanting (i.e. motivation) to do something about it. Compassion is, however, not pity, neither an attachment, nor the same as empathetic feeling, nor even just simply wishful thinking. Compassion is basically a variation of love. To further this variation of love, Skalski and Aanstoos, in their article The Phenomenology of Change Beyond Tolerating, describe compassion with the definition of alleviate in mind. In the definition for alleviate there is no mention of taking, stopping, or fixing someone&#x27;s suffering. It is simply trying to make it less severe. This has a connotation of desperation of sorts. Desiring so little from such a dire situation can be described as inspiring feelings to help with another&#x27;s suffering in any way.
:* Emma Seppala distinguishes compassion from empathy and altruism as follows: &quot;... The definition of compassion is often confused with that of empathy. Empathy, as defined by researchers, is the visceral or emotional experience of another person&#x27;s feelings. It is, in a sense, an automatic mirroring of another&#x27;s emotion, like tearing up at a friend&#x27;s sadness. Altruism is an action that benefits someone else. It may or may not be accompanied by empathy or compassion, for example, in the case of making a donation for tax purposes. Although these terms are related to compassion, they are not identical. Compassion often involves an empathic response and altruistic behavior; however, compassion is defined as the emotional response when perceiving suffering which involves an authentic desire to help.&quot;

In addition, the more a person knows about the human condition and human experiences, the more vivid the route to identification with suffering becomes. Identifying with another person is an essential process for human beings, something that is even illustrated by infants who begin to mirror the facial expressions and body movements of their mother as early as the first days of their lives. Compassion is recognized through identifying with other people (i.e. perspective-taking), the knowledge of human behavior, the perception of suffering, the transfer of feelings, and the knowledge of goal and purpose-changes in sufferers which leads to the decline of their suffering.

Personality psychology agrees that human suffering is always individual and unique. Suffering can result from psychological, social, and physical trauma which happens in acute and chronic forms. Suffering has been defined as the perception of a person&#x27;s impending destruction or loss of integrity, which continues until the threat is vanquished or the person&#x27;s integrity can be restored.

Compassion therefore has three major requirements: The compassionate person must feel that the troubles that evoke their feelings are serious; the belief that the sufferers&#x27; troubles are not self-inflicted; and the ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming, non-shaming manner.

Because the compassion process is highly related to identifying with another person and is possible among people from other countries, cultures, locations, etc., compassion is characteristic of democratic societies.

The role of compassion as a factor contributing to individual or societal behavior has been the topic of continuous debate. In contrast to the process of identifying with other people, a complete absence of compassion may require ignoring or disapproving identification with other people or groups. Earlier studies established the links between interpersonal violence and cruelty which leads to indifference. Compassion may induce feelings of kindness and forgiveness, which could give people the ability to stop situations that have the potential to be distressing and occasionally lead to violence. This concept has been illustrated throughout history: The Holocaust, genocide, European colonization of the Americas, etc. The seemingly essential step in these atrocities could be the definition of the victims as &quot;not human&quot; or &quot;not us&quot;. The atrocities committed throughout human history are thus claimed to have only been relieved, minimized, or overcome in their damaging effects through the presence of compassion, although recently, drawing on empirical research in evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, social neuroscience, and psychopathy, it has been counterargued that compassion or empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary, since over the course of history, mankind has created social structures for upholding universal moral principles, such as Human Rights and the International Criminal Court.

On one hand, Thomas Nagel, for instance, critiques Joshua Greene by suggesting that he is too quick to conclude utilitarianism specifically from the general goal of constructing an impartial morality; for example, he says, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls offer other impartial approaches to ethical questions.

In his defense against the possible destructive nature of passions, Plato compared the human soul to a chariot: the intellect is the driver and the emotions are the horses, and life is a continual struggle to keep the emotions under control. In his defense of a solid universal morality, Immanuel Kant saw compassion as a weak and misguided sentiment. &quot;Such benevolence is called soft-heartedness and should not occur at all among human beings&quot;, he said of it.

== Psychology ==
Compassion has become associated with and researched in the fields of positive psychology and social psychology. Compassion is a process of connecting by identifying with another person. This identification with others through compassion can lead to increased motivation to do something in an effort to relieve the suffering of others.

Compassion is an evolved function from the harmony of a three grid internal system: contentment-and-peace system, goals-and-drives system, and threat-and-safety system. Paul Gilbert defines these collectively as necessary regulated systems for compassion.

Paul Ekman describes a &quot;taxonomy of compassion&quot; including: emotional recognition (knowing how another person feels), emotional resonance (feeling emotions another person feels), familial connection (care-giver-offspring), global compassion (extending compassion to everyone in the world), sentient compassion (extended compassion to other species), and heroic compassion (compassion that comes with a risk).

Ekman also distinguishes proximal (i.e. in the moment) from distal compassion (i.e. predicting the future; affective forecasting): &quot;...it has implications in terms of how we go about encouraging compassion. We are all familiar with proximal compassion: Someone falls down in the street, and we help him get up. That&#x27;s proximal compassion: where we see someone in need, and we help them. But, when I used to tell my kids, &#x27;Wear a helmet,&#x27; that&#x27;s distal compassion: trying to prevent harm before it occurs. And that requires a different set of skills: It requires social forecasting, anticipating harm before it occurs, and trying to prevent it. Distal compassion is much more amenable to educational influences, I think, and it&#x27;s our real hope.&quot; Distal compassion also requires perspective-taking.

Compassion is associated with psychological outcomes including increases in mindfulness and emotion regulation.

While empathy plays an important role in motivating caring for others and in guiding moral behavior, Jean Decety&#x27;s research demonstrates that this is far from being systematic or irrespective to the social identity of the targets, interpersonal relationships, and social context. He proposes that empathic concern (compassion) has evolved to favor kin and members of one own social group, can bias social decision-making by valuing one single individual over a group of others, and this can frontally conflict with principles of fairness and justice.

=== Compassion fatigue ===

People with a higher capacity or responsibility to empathize with others may be at risk for &quot;compassion fatigue&quot;, also called &quot;secondary traumatic stress&quot;. Examples of people at risk for compassion fatigue are those who spend significant time responding to information related to suffering. However, newer research by Singer and Ricard suggests that it is lack of suitable distress tolerance that gets people fatigued from compassion activities. Individuals at risk for compassion fatigue usually display these four key attributes: diminished endurance and/or energy, declined empathic ability, helplessness and/or hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion. Negative coping skills can also increase the risk of developing compassion fatigue.

People can alleviate sorrow and distress by doing self-care activities on a regular basis. helps to guide people to recognize the impact and circumstances of past events. After people , they are able to find the causes of compassion fatigue in their daily life. Practice of nonjudgmental compassion can prevent fatigue and burnout. Some methods that can help people to heal compassion fatigue include physical activity, eating healthy food with every meal, good relations with others, enjoying interacting with others in the community, writing a journal frequently, and sleeping enough every day. The practice of mindfulness and self-awareness also helps with compassion fatigue.

=== Conditions that influence compassion ===
Psychologist Paul Gilbert provides factors that can reduce the likelihood of someone being willing to be compassionate to another. These include (less): likability, competence, deservedness, empathic-capacity; (more) self-focused competitiveness, anxiety-depression, overwhelmed; and inhibitors in social structures and systems.

==== Compassion fade ====

Compassion fade is the tendency of people to experience a decrease in empathy as the number of people in need of aid increases. The term was coined by psychologist Paul Slovic. It is a type of cognitive bias that people use to justify their decision to help or not to help, and to ignore certain information. To turn compassion into compassionate behavior requires .

In an examination of the motivated regulation of compassion in the context of large-scale crises, such as natural disasters and genocides, research established that people tend to feel more compassion for single identifiable victims than single anonymous victims or large masses of victims (the Identifiable victim effect). People only show less compassion for many victims than for single victims of disasters when they expect to incur a financial cost upon helping. This collapse of compassion depends on having the motivation and ability to regulate emotions. People are more apt to offer help to a certain number of needy people if that number is closer to the whole number of people in need. People feel more compassionate towards members of another species the more recently our species and theirs had a common ancestor.

In laboratory research, psychologists are exploring how concerns about becoming emotionally exhausted may motivate people to curb their compassion for—and dehumanize—members of stigmatized social groups, such as homeless individuals and drug addicts.

==Neurobiology==
Olga Klimecki (&quot;et al.&quot;), found differential (non-overlapping) fMRI brain activation areas in respect to compassion and empathy: compassion was associated with the mOFC, pregenual ACC, and ventral striatum. Empathy, in contrast, was associated with the anterior insula and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC).

In one study conducted by James Rilling and Gregory Berns, neuroscientists at Emory University, subjects&#x27; brain activities were recorded while they helped someone in need. It was found that while the subjects were performing compassionate acts, the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate regions of the brain were activated, the same areas of the brain associated with pleasure and reward. One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy. The same study showed a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding and personal reputation. True compassion, if it exists at all, is thus inherently motivated (at least to some degree) by self-interest.

In a 2009 small fMRI experiment, researchers at the Brain and Creativity Institute studied strong feelings of compassion for and physical pain in others. Both feelings involved an expected change in activity in the anterior insula, anterior cingulate, hypothalamus, and midbrain, but they also found a previously undescribed pattern of cortical activity on the posterior medial surface of each brain hemisphere, a region involved in the default mode of brain function, and implicated in . Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent. Activity in the anterior insula related to compassion for social pain peaked later and endured longer than that associated with compassion for physical pain. Compassionate emotions toward others affect the prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and the midbrain. Feelings and acts of compassion stimulate areas known to regulate homeostasis, such as the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate, the mesencephalon, the insular cortex and the hypothalamus, supporting the hypothesis that social emotions use some of the same basic devices involved in other, primary emotions.

== Compassion in practice ==
=== Medicine ===
Compassion is one of the most important attributes for physicians practicing medical services. Compassion brings about the desire to do something to help the sufferer. That desire to be helpful is not compassion, but it does suggest that compassion is similar to other emotions in that it motivates behaviors to reduce the tension brought on by the emotion. Physicians generally identify their central duties as the responsibility to put the patient&#x27;s interests first, including the duty not to harm, to deliver proper care, and to maintain confidentiality. Compassion is seen in each of those duties because of its direct relation to the recognition and treatment of suffering. Physicians who use compassion understand the effects of sickness and suffering on human behavior. Compassion may be closely related to love and the emotions evoked in sickness and suffering. This is illustrated by the relationship between patients and physicians in medical institutions. The relationship between suffering patients and their caregivers provides evidence that compassion is a social emotion that is the closeness and cooperation between individuals.

=== Psychotherapy ===

Compassion-focused therapy, created by clinical psychologist Professor Paul Gilbert, focuses on the evolutionary psychology behind compassion: balancing of affect regulation systems (e.g. using affiliative emotions from the care-and-contentment system to soothe and reduce painful emotions from the threat-detection system).

== Self-compassion ==

Self-compassion is being kind to oneself and accepting suffering as a quality of being human. It has positive effects on subjective happiness, optimism, wisdom, curiosity, agreeableness, and extroversion. Kristin Neff and Christopher Germer identified three levels of activities that thwart self-compassion: self-criticism, self-isolation, and self-absorption; they equate this to fight, flight, and freeze responses. Parenting practices contribute to the development of self-compassion in children. Maternal support, secure attachment, and harmonious family functioning all create an environment where self-compassion can develop. On the other hand, certain developmental factors (i.e., personal fable) can hinder the development of self-compassion in children.

&quot;Authentic leadership&quot; centered on humanism and on nourishing quality interconnectedness increase compassion in the workplace to self and others.

Judith Jordan&#x27;s concept of &quot;self-empathy&quot; is similar to self-compassion, it implies the capacity to notice, care, and respond towards one&#x27;s own felt needs. Strategies of self-care involve valuing oneself, thinking about one&#x27;s compassionately, and connecting with others in order renewal, support, and validation. Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion.

== Religion and philosophy ==
===Abrahamic religions===
====Christianity====
The Christian Bible&#x27;s Second Epistle to the Corinthians is but one place where God is spoken of as the &quot;Father of mercies&quot; (or &quot;compassion&quot;) and the &quot;God of all comfort.&quot;

Jesus embodies the essence of compassion and relational care. Christ challenges Christians to forsake their own desires and to act compassionately towards others, particularly those in need or distress.


One of his most well-known teachings about compassion is the Parable of the Good Samaritan (), in which a Samaritan traveler &quot;was moved with compassion&quot; at the sight of a man who was beaten. Jesus also demonstrated compassion to those his society had condemned—tax collectors, prostitutes, and criminals—by saying &quot;just because you received a loaf of bread, does not mean you were more conscientious about it, or more caring about your fellow man&quot;.

An interpretation of the incarnation and crucifixion of Jesus is that it was undertaken from a compassionate desire to feel the suffering of and effect the salvation of mankind; this was also a compassionate sacrifice by God of his own son (&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son...&quot;).

A 2012 study of the historical Jesus claimed that he sought to elevate Judaic compassion as the supreme human virtue, capable of reducing suffering and fulfilling our God-ordained purpose of transforming the world into something more worthy of its creator.

====Islam====
In the Muslim tradition, foremost among God&#x27;s attributes are mercy and compassion, or, in the canonical language of Arabic, and . Each of the 114 chapters of the Quran, with one exception, begins with the verse, &quot;In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful.&quot;

The Arabic word for compassion is . Its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer, and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e., by reciting . The womb and family ties are characterized by compassion and named after the exalted attribute of Allah &quot;&quot; (The Compassionate).

====Judaism====
In the Jewish tradition, God is the Compassionate and is invoked as the Father of Compassion: hence or Compassionate becomes the usual designation for His revealed word. (Compare, above, the frequent use of in the Quran). Sorrow and pity for one in distress, creating a desire to relieve it, is a feeling ascribed alike to man and God: in Biblical Hebrew, (, from , the mother, womb), &quot;to pity&quot; or &quot;to show mercy&quot; in view of the sufferer&#x27;s helplessness, hence also &quot;to forgive&quot; (), &quot;to forbear&quot; (; ; ). The Rabbis speak of the &quot;thirteen attributes of compassion&quot;. The Biblical conception of compassion is the feeling of the parent for the child. Hence the prophet&#x27;s appeal in confirmation of his trust in God invokes the feeling of a mother for her offspring ().

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century Rabbi Hillel the Elder. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the Mishnah and the Talmud and, as such, is one of the most important figures in Jewish history. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion &quot;while standing on one leg&quot; (meaning in the most concise terms) Hillel stated: &quot;That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is the explanation; go and learn.&quot; Post 9/11, the words of Rabbi Hillel are frequently quoted in public lectures and interviews around the world by the prominent writer on comparative religion Karen Armstrong.

Many Jewish sources speak of the importance of compassion for and prohibitions on causing needless pain to animals. Significant rabbis who have done so include Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch Rabbi Simhah Zissel Ziv, and Rabbi Moshe Cordovero.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
In ancient Greek philosophy motivations based on (feeling, passion) were typically distrusted. Reason was generally considered to be the proper guide to conduct. Compassion was considered ; hence, is depicted as blindfolded, because her virtue is dispassion — not compassion.

Aristotle compared compassion with indignation and thought they were both worthy feelings: Compassion means being pained by another person&#x27;s unearned misfortune; indignation means being pained by another&#x27;s unearned good fortune. Both are an unhappy awareness of an unjust imbalance.

Stoicism had a doctrine of rational compassion known as .

In Roman society, compassion was often seen as a vice when it was expressed as pity rather than mercy. In other words, showing empathy toward someone who was seen as deserving was considered virtuous, whereas showing empathy to someone deemed unworthy was considered immoral and weak.

===Confucianism===
Mencius maintained that everyone possesses the germ or root of compassion, illustrating his case with the famous example of the child at an open well:

&quot;Suppose a man were, all of a sudden, to see a young child on the verge of falling into a well. He would certainly be moved to compassion, not because he wanted to get into the good graces of the parents, nor because he wished to win the praise of his fellow-villagers or friends, nor yet because he disliked the cry of the child&quot;.

Mencius saw the task of moral cultivation as that of developing the initial impulse of compassion into an enduring quality of benevolence.

===Indian religions===
====Buddhism====
The first of the Four Noble Truths is the truth of suffering or (unsatisfactoriness or stress). is one of the three distinguishing characteristics of all conditioned existence. It arises as a consequence of not understanding the nature of impermanence (the second characteristic) as well as a lack of understanding that all phenomena are empty of self (the third characteristic).

When one has an understanding of suffering and its origins and understands that liberation from suffering is possible, renunciation arises. Renunciation then lays the foundation for the development of compassion for others who also suffer. 
This is developed in stages:

; Ordinary compassion: The compassion we have for those close to us such as friends and family and a wish to free them from the &#x27;suffering of suffering&#x27;
; Immeasurable compassion: This is the compassion that wishes to benefit all beings without exception. It is associated with both the Hinayana and Mahayana paths.

; Great Compassion: This is practiced exclusively in the Mahayana tradition and is associated with the development of Bodhicitta. The Bodhisattva Vow begins (in one version): &quot;Suffering beings are numberless, I vow to liberate them all.&quot;

The 14th Dalai Lama has said, &quot;If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.&quot; But he also warned that compassion is difficult to develop:

====Hinduism====


In classical literature of Hinduism, compassion is a virtue with many shades, each shade explained by different terms. Three most common terms are (), (), and (). Other words related to compassion in Hinduism include , , and . Some of these words are used interchangeably among the schools of Hinduism to explain the concept of compassion, its sources, its consequences, and its nature. The virtue of compassion to all living beings, claims Gandhi and others, is a central concept in Hindu philosophy.

 is defined by &quot;Padma Purana&quot; as the virtuous desire to mitigate the sorrow and difficulties of others by putting forth whatever effort necessary. &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; describes as the value that treats all living beings (including human beings) as one&#x27;s own self, wanting the welfare and good of the other living being. Such compassion, claims &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, is one of necessary paths to being happy. Ekadashi Tattvam explains is treating a stranger, a relative, a friend, and a foe as one&#x27;s own self; and argues that compassion is that state when one sees all living beings as part of one&#x27;s own self, and when everyone&#x27;s suffering is seen as one&#x27;s own suffering. Compassion to all living beings, including to those who are strangers and those who are foes, is seen as a noble virtue.

, another word for compassion in Hindu philosophy, means placing one&#x27;s mind in other&#x27;s favor, thereby seeking to understand the best way to help alleviate their suffering through an act of (compassion). , yet another word for compassion, refers to one&#x27;s state after one has observed and understood the pain and suffering in others.

In Mahabharata, Indra praises Yudhishthira for his – compassion, sympathy – for all creatures. Tulsidas contrasts (compassion) with (arrogance, contempt of others), claiming compassion is a source of dharmic life, while arrogance a source of sin. (compassion) is not (pity) in Hinduism, or feeling sorry for the sufferer, because that is marred with condescension; compassion is recognizing one&#x27;s own and another&#x27;s suffering in order to actively alleviate that suffering. Compassion is the basis for , a core virtue in Hindu philosophy and an article of everyday faith and practice. , or non-injury, is compassion-in-action that helps actively prevent suffering in all living things as well as helping beings overcome suffering and move closer to liberation.

Compassion in Hinduism is discussed as an absolute and a relative concept. There are two forms of compassion: one for those who suffer even though they have done nothing wrong and one for those who suffer because they did something wrong. Absolute compassion applies to both, while relative compassion addresses the difference between the former and the latter. An example of the latter include those who plead guilty or are convicted of a crime such as murder; in these cases, the virtue of compassion must be balanced with the virtue of justice.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ,&quot; written between and , and sometimes called the &quot;Tamil Veda&quot;, is a cherished classic on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It dedicates Chapter 25 of Book 1 to compassion, further dedicating separate chapters each for the resulting values of compassion, chiefly, vegetarianism or veganism (Chapter 26), doing no harm (Chapter 32), non-killing (Chapter 33), possession of kindness (Chapter 8), dreading evil deeds (Chapter 21), benignity (Chapter 58), the right scepter (Chapter 55), and absence of terrorism (Chapter 57), to name a few.

====Jainism====

Compassion for all life, human and non-human, is central to the Jain tradition. Though all life is considered sacred, human life is deemed the highest form of earthly existence. To kill any person, no matter their crime, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is the only substantial religious tradition that requires both monks and laity to be vegetarian. It is suggested that certain strains of the Hindu tradition became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences. The Jain tradition&#x27;s stance on nonviolence, however, goes far beyond vegetarianism. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice veganism. Jains run animal shelters all over India. The Lal Mandir, a prominent Jain temple in Delhi, is known for the Jain Birds Hospital in a second building behind the main temple.

<doc id="327446" wikidata="Q1754096" url="?curid=327446" title="Weybridge">
<text>Weybridge () is a town in the Elmbridge district in Surrey, England, around southwest of central London. The settlement is recorded as &quot;Waigebrugge&quot; and &quot;Weibrugge&quot; in the 7th century and the name derives from a crossing point of the River Wey, which flows into the River Thames to the north of the town centre. The earliest evidence of human activity is from the Bronze Age. During the Anglo-Saxon and medieval periods, Weybridge was held by Chertsey Abbey. In 2011 it had a population of 15,449.

In the 1530s, Henry VIII constructed Oatlands Palace to the north of the town centre, which he intended to be the residence of his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. He married Catherine Howard there in July 1540 and the palace remained a royal residence until the Civil War. The buildings were demolished in the early 1650s and a new mansion, Oatlands House, was constructed to the east of Weybridge later the same century. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany owned the mansion in the 18th century.

The town began to expand beyond its medieval footprint in the early 19th century, catalysed by the initial breakup of the Oatlands House estate, the enclosure of Weybridge Heath and the opening of the railway station in 1838. The developer, W. G. Tarrant, was responsible for the construction of housing on St George&#x27;s Hill in the first half of the 20th century.

The world&#x27;s first purpose-built racing circuit was constructed at Brooklands in 1907. The track hosted the first British Grand Prix in 1926 and was used by Malcolm Campbell to develop his final land speed record car, Campbell-Railton Blue Bird. Throughout the 20th century, Brooklands was an important location for the aerospace industry and aircraft developed and tested there included the Sopwith Camel, the Wellington bomber and the Hurricane fighter. Vickers established a factory at the circuit in 1915 and aircraft manufacturing continued at the site until 1988.

==Toponymy==
The first written records of a settlement at Weybridge date from the 7th century, when its name is given as &quot;Waigebrugge&quot; and &quot;Weibrugge&quot;. It appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Webrige&quot; and &quot;Webruge&quot; and in subsequent surviving documents as &quot;Waibrigge&quot; and &quot;Wabrigge&quot; (12th century) and &quot;Wybrugge&quot; and &quot;Weybrugge&quot; (13th century). The name simply means &quot;Bridge over the River Wey&quot;.

Oatlands is first recorded in 1383 as &quot;Otelands&quot;, which may indicate that the area was used for the cultivation of oats. The earliest written record of Brooklands is from 1548, when it appears as &quot;Brokeland&quot;. The name probably means &quot;marshy land&quot;. St George&#x27;s Hill appears to have acquired its current name in the early 17th century. It is recorded as &quot;Le Bery&quot; in 1337 and &quot;Oldebury&quot; in 1548. The previous name may derive from the Old English word &quot;burh&quot;, which might reference the Iron Age earthworks on the hill.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Weybridge is in northwest Surrey, approximately southwest of central London. The town centre is close to the confluence of the River Wey and the River Thames, but the settlement also includes St George&#x27;s Hill and Brooklands, to the south. The highest point in Weybridge is above ordnance datum, but the low-lying areas close to the rivers are only above sea level.

Neighbouring settlements include Shepperton to the north, Walton-on-Thames to the east, Wisley to the south and Addlestone to the west.

===Geology===
The rock strata on which Weybridge sits were deposited in the Cenozoic. The Bagshot Sands are the main outcrop to the south of the town and at Brooklands. From the centre of Weybridge northwards towards the Thames, the surface geology is dominated by river gravels.

Overlying the Bagshot Sands at St George&#x27;s Hill is a cap of Bracklesham Clay, which was used for brickmaking in the 19th century. Ironstone, containing 33-48% iron(III) oxide, is also found on the Hill, along with a capping of chert gravels, thought to have been deposited by a former course of the River Wey.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human occupation in Weybridge is from the Bronze Age. A number of weapons, including socketed axe heads, a rapier, and a palstave, were retrieved from the River Wey close to the Wey Bridge in 1912. At least fifty cinerary urns dating from the same period were found in the area in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Three of the urns were recovered from a barrow during building work on the Silvermere estate (south of St George&#x27;s Hill) and were found to contain bones and charcoal.

A copper-alloy bucket, now held by the British Museum, was discovered during the construction of the Brooklands racetrack in 1907. It is thought to have originated in northern Italy in the late Bronze or early Iron Age and similar vessels have been found in Austria, Belgium and Germany. During the Iron Age, there was a fort on St George&#x27;s Hill. It covered an area of around and was protected by a rampart and ditch. Most traces of the fort were destroyed by housebuilding in the first half of the 20th century. Remains of a roundhouse and archaeological evidence of iron workings were discovered in the triangle of land between the railway lines in 1981.

There is not thought to have been a significant Roman presence in Weybridge, but 68 bronze coins of the late 3rd and early 4th centuries were found at Brooklands in 1907. Much of the hoard, which included &quot;nummi&quot; from the reigns of Diocletian (284–305 CE), Maximian (286–305), Constantius I (305–306) and Galerius (305–311), was donated to the British Museum.

===Governance===
There are three separate entries for Weybridge in Domesday Book. The first area of land described was held by Bishop Odo of Bayeux as tenant-in-chief and Herfrid of Throwley as lesser tenant. It included of meadow and woodland for five swine with a value of £5 per annum. The other two entries list areas belonging to Chertsey Abbey, totalling a further 16 acres of meadow, land for four swine and ploughland for 1½ plough teams. None of the entries records a church or a mill in the settlement.

There are only sporadic surviving references to Weybridge in the following centuries. A chapel is mentioned in a papal bull issued by Pope Alexander III in 1176 and a later document shows that Chertsey Abbey had sold the advowson to Newark Priory by 1200. By 1262, the Priory had obtained a license that confirmed its rights to appoint a priest, to hold church property and to collect tithes from the local residents. In 1284 the village was held by Geoffrey de Lucy as a lesser tenant of Chertsey Abbey.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries, Weybridge was held by the Rede family for three years, before passing to the Crown in 1537. In June of the same year, Henry VIII began to construct Oatlands Palace by expanding an existing late-medieval manor house located to the north of the town centre. Some of the stone used in the construction of the foundations was taken from the demolition of Chertsey Abbey. Henry had intended that the palace would become the residence of his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, but the marriage was annulled after six months. The king married his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, at Oatlands, but rarely visited thereafter. Following Henry&#x27;s death the palace remained a possession of the Crown until the Commonwealth, when the contents were sold and the buildings demolished. Only a side entrance gate and adjoining sections of walls, which date from , remain.

Reforms during the Tudor period reduced the importance of manorial courts and the day-to-day administration of towns such as Weybridge became the responsibility of the vestry of the parish church. The Weybridge vestry oversaw the distribution of poor relief and the maintenance of local roads. In the 1840s, responsibility for poor relief was transferred to the Chertsey Board of Guardians of the Poor. Local drainage and highways boards were established in the 1860s and in the 1870s a burial board was created to purchase land for new cemeteries.

The Local Government Act 1888 transferred many administrative responsibilities to the newly formed Surrey County Council and was followed by an 1894 Act that created the Weybridge Urban District Council (UDC). Initially the council met at the National school, but moved to Aberdeen House at the junction of High Street and Baker Street in 1908. As a result of the Local Government Act 1929, the UDCs of Weybridge and Walton were combined in 1932. In 1951 the civil parish of Weybridge had a population of 8083. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. The unified council was merged with the Esher UDC to form Elmbridge Borough Council in 1974.

===Transport and communications===
The name &quot;Weybridge&quot; suggests that there has been a bridge over the River Wey in the area since Anglo-Saxon times. During the Elizabethan period, the bridge was a wooden structure, long and wide and was maintained by Elizabeth I in her capacity as lord of the manor. The structure was rebuilt in 1808 on 13 wooden arches. The present bridge dates from 1865 and is constructed from brick, iron and stone. A second bridge, downstream of the first, was completed in 1945 and now carries the A317.
Both the Thames and the Wey have been used for transport since ancient times. By the 14th century, there was a wharf at Weybridge used for shipment of timber and, in 1463, Thomas Warner was given permission to build a dock on his land, which became known as the &quot;Crown Wharf&quot;. In 1537, materials for the construction of Oatlands Palace were transported to Weybridge by river. The River Wey Navigation was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1651. Twelve locks (including two flood locks) and of new cuts were constructed between the Thames and Guildford. Thames Lock was rebuilt in concrete in the 1930s, but like all the locks on the Wey, it was originally turf sided.

The earliest locks on the upper Thames were built in the 17th century, following the establishment of the Oxford-Burcot Commission. However, efforts to improve the stretch of the river through Weybridge did not start until the following century. In 1789, a flash lock was installed at Sunbury, but was replaced by a pound lock in 1812. Shepperton Lock opened the following year. The construction of the locks regulated the flow of the river and increased its depth, facilitating navigation and maintaining an adequate head of water to power mills.

The River Thames through Weybridge was further improved when the Desborough Cut was opened in 1935. The navigable channel bypasses a meander and was primarily designed to increase the flood capacity of the river. Construction of the cut created the Desborough Island, the entirety of which is in Weybridge.
The London and Southampton Railway Company opened the station at Weybridge in May 1838. Initially the station had two platforms and was in a deep cutting between St George&#x27;s Hill and Weybridge Heath. The typical journey time to London was around an hour and, by 1841, a mail train was stopping daily. A junction was created to the west of the station in 1848, when the line to was constructed. Additional tracks on the main line through the station were added in 1885 and 1902. The lines through the station were electrified in 1907, although steam locomotives continued to haul long-distance express services through Weybridge until 1967. The goods yard was closed in 1964 and signal boxes in the local area were shut in March 1970, when control of the lines was transferred to Surbiton Panel Box. An arson attack in January 1987, resulted in the destruction of the 1904 station building.

A manual telephone exchange opened in Weybridge in 1912 and was replaced in 1954 by an automated facility in Heath Road, which had sufficient capacity for 2500 lines.

===Residential development===
Although Weybridge was still only a small village in the early 18th century, a high proportion of the residents were members of the aristocracy. In 1724, the rector noted that it was increasingly becoming a place for &quot;gentile retirement&quot; and recorded eighteen upper-class families living in the area. The settlement was dominated by two estates: Portmore Park, to the north west of the centre, was the seat of the Colyear family, the Earls of Portmore; Oatlands Park, to the east, had been built on the former deer park belonging to Oatlands Palace and was purchased by Prince Frederick, the Duke of York and Albany, in 1790.
Towards the end of the 18th century, Weybridge was beginning to expand beyond its medieval footprint. In 1800, Weybridge Heath, an area of common land to the south east of the village centre, was enclosed. The Byfleet and Weybridge Inclosures Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. lxxxvii) enabled the Duke of York to purchase almost the whole of St George&#x27;s Hill and to add it to the Oatlands Estate. Four years later, Hanger Hill, one of the roads running across the heath, was laid out and plots alongside it were sold for housebuilding.

The Duke of York sold Oatlands Park in 1824, but the new owner, Edward Hughes Ball Hughes, was forced to lease the house and the surrounding to Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, three years later. The remainder of the Oatlands estate was sold in stages between 1828 and 1846. Housebuilding began almost as soon as the land was released, stimulated in part by the opening of Weybridge railway station in 1838. The majority of the houses in Oatlands village were completed by 1859. Oatlands Park House was sold to the developer W. G. Tarrant in 1909.
The west side of Weybridge High Street was developed when the Portmore Park estate was broken up in 1880s. The estate, approximately covering the area between the High Street and the River Wey, had been established by Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk in the 1670s. It was purchased by the Locke King family in 1861, who sold the land for residential development in the final decades of the 19th century.

St George&#x27;s Hill was developed by W. G. Tarrant, who bought of land from the Edgerton family in 1911. A year later he began the construction of the Tennis and Golf Clubs and published a series of promotions in the &quot;Surrey Herald&quot; to advertise the houses that he intended to build. Strict covenants were imposed on the development and the minimum size of each property was fixed as . Construction was interrupted by the First World War, but resumed shortly afterwards, continuing until the start of the Great Depression in the late 1920s.

The first council housing in the town was built by the Weybridge UDC between 1923 and 1927, when 160 houses were constructed on the Old Palace Gardens estate. Following the end of the Second World War, the Weybridge and Walton UDC built over 1000 houses in the two towns.

===Brooklands===
Brooklands, the first purpose-built motor-racing circuit in the world, opened in 1907. Constructed on farmland to the south of Weybridge, the concrete track was designed by Capel Lofft Holden and had a total length of . The first races for motorcars took place in July 1907 and for motorcycles in February the following year. Both attracted a large number of entrants from across Europe and by 1911, the British Automobile Racing Club had established a programme of regular race meetings.

Motor racing ceased for the duration of the First World War and did not resume until 1920. The first two British Grands Prix took place at the circuit in 1926 and 1927. The JCC 200 Mile race also took place at the circuit from 1921 to 1928, and again in 1938. In the early 1930s, Malcolm Campbell developed the Campbell-Railton Blue Bird, his final land speed record car, at Brooklands. Racing ceased for a second time at the outbreak of the Second World War.
Brooklands also played a key role in the development of the British aeronautical industry. In 1907, the aviation pioneer, A. V. Roe, performed the first flight by a British-built aeroplane at the circuit shortly after it opened in 1907. By 1912, several flying schools had been established at Brooklands and the Vickers company began manufacturing aircraft in 1915. The Sopwith Camel was among several aircraft developed at Brooklands during the First World War.

Aircraft manufacture continued during the 1920s and 1930s. Among those working at the Vickers factory was Barnes Wallis, who was involved in designing the Wellesley and the Wellington bombers. The Hawker Aircraft company opened a factory at Brooklands in 1935 and began building prototypes of the Hurricane fighter. Aircraft manufacture intensified during the Second World War and new factories, warehouses and hangars were rapidly built, encroaching onto the racing circuit. The track was breached near Byfleet to improve access for deliveries to the site and a large workshop was cut into the concrete at the north end. Following the end of hostilities in 1945, the track was considered to be in such poor condition that a resumption of motor racing was ruled impossible.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, the manufacturers based at Brooklands started to transition towards the production of civilian airliners. Vickers began producing the VC series of aircraft with the VC1 Viking in 1945. The VC10 was launched in 1964, by which point the company had been nationalised as the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Increasingly BAC began to refocus manufacturing at Brooklands to the production of aircraft parts, with final assembly elsewhere. Components of the British-built Concordes were manufactured at the site in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1977, BAC merged with Hawker-Siddeley to form British Aerospace and the combined entity began to run down the Brooklands site. Aerospace manufacturing finally ceased in Weybridge in 1988.

===Commerce and industry===
Although no mill is mentioned in the Weybridge entries in the Domesday book, watermills appear to have played an important role in the economy of the area since at least the early modern period. The earliest record of a mill in the town is from 1693, when a paper mill was built at the confluence of the Wey and Thames.

Ironstone was quarried from Weybridge Heath and St George&#x27;s Hill, although the dates of these workings are uncertain. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, iron was smelted at a mill on Whittet&#x27;s Ait and there is reference to iron and steel manufacture taking place at two mills in Byfleet in 1760. The Whittet&#x27;s Ait mill appears to have been used as a &quot;Brass Wire Mill&quot; in the 1760s and the machinery required for iron smelting had been fitted by 1769.
A mill for grinding malt was built on the Wey upstream of Thames Lock in around 1819, but had fallen into disrepair by 1830. In 1842 a new mill for extracting vegetable oil from seeds was built on the same site and the Whittet&#x27;s Ait mill was also being used for the same purpose by the 1930s. In the 1970s, Whittet&#x27;s Ait was the site of a solvent refinery.

For much of the 20th century, Weybridge was a centre for the aerospace industry. The Lang Propeller Works was established on Whittet&#x27;s Ait in 1913 and, in 1915, the Vickers company took over the Itala motor works at Brooklands. The circuit was also the base for several other aircraft manufacturers including Avro, Sopwith and Blériot.

As of 2021, the European headquarters of Sony and the UK headquarters of Procter &amp; Gamble are at Brooklands.

===Weybridge in the world wars===
At the start of the First World War, Weybridge became a training base for the 244 Motorised Transport Company, an army unit of mechanics and drivers operating as part of the 19th Divisional Supply Column. The company served throughout the war in the Gallipoli and Balkans campaigns. There were two military hospitals in Oatlands. Barnham Lodge opened as a 35-bed hospital in 1915 and, by 1917, a small operating theatre was in use and the facility was being run by the British Red Cross. Oatlands Park Hotel was requisitioned in 1916 as a hospital for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and was primarily used to treat &quot;medical &amp; tuberculosis cases and limbless men&quot;.

Ethel Locke King, the chair of the Chertsey branch of the Red Cross, was instrumental in establishing 15 hospitals in the local area during the First World War. She also organised a rest station for troops at Weybridge railway station. In January 1918, Locke King became a Dame Commander of the British Empire.

The presence of the Vickers aircraft factory made Weybridge an obvious target for enemy bombing during the Second World War. The defence of the town was coordinated by the 3rd Surrey Battalion of the Home Guard and five platoons of the C company were stationed at Brooklands. The local civil defence headquarters were established at the UDC offices in Aberdeen House and the council built a large air raid shelter at the Churchfields Recreation Ground. Serious bombing began in the local area in August 1940 and by December of that year 97 residents had died and 1300 houses had been damaged.

A devastating air raid took place on the Vickers plant in September 1940, when 83 people were killed. A bomb landed on the floor of the factory, but failed to explode. Five men of the Royal Canadian Engineers successfully removed the bomb from the building before it exploded. Lieutenant John Patton was subsequently awarded the George Cross for his role in the incident. Later in the war, 19 V-1 flying bombs landed in the Weybridge and Walton area.

==National and local government==
===UK parliament===
The town is in the parliamentary constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge and has been represented at Westminster since May 2019 by Conservative Ben Spencer. Between 1997 and 2019, the constituency was represented by Philip Hammond, who was elevated to the House of Lords as Lord Hammond of Runnymede in 2020.

===County council===
Councillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. The majority of the town is in the &quot;Weybridge&quot; electoral division, but areas to the east of the centre are in the &quot;Walton South and Oatlands&quot; and &quot;Hersham&quot; electoral divisions.

===Borough council===
Weybridge is divided between three wards, each of which elect three councillors to Elmbridge Borough Council. The three wards are &quot;Oatlands and Burwood Park&quot;, &quot;Weybridge Riverside&quot; and &quot;Weybridge St George&#x27;s Hill&quot;.

Between 1966 and 2009, the Borough of Elmbridge was twinned with Rueil-Malmaison in northern France.

==Demography and housing==

Across the South East Region, 28% of homes were detached houses and 22.6% were apartments.

==Transport==
===Public transport===

Weybridge railway station is to the south of the town centre. It is managed by South Western Railway, which operates all services. Trains run to via and to .

Weybridge is linked by bus to surrounding towns and villages in north Surrey and south west London. Operators serving the town include Arriva, Diamond Bus, the East Surrey Rural Transport Partnership and Falcon Buses.

===River navigations===
The non-tidal section of the River Thames is navigable between Lechlade in Gloucestershire and Teddington Lock. The navigation authority is the Environment Agency. The River Wey is navigable from Weybridge to Godalming and the navigation authority is the National Trust.

===National cycle route===
National Cycle Route 4, which links London to Fishguard, passes through Weybridge.

===Long-distance footpaths===
The Thames Path runs along the south bank of the River Thames, to the north of the town centre.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
Weybridge received its first drinking water supply in 1869, when the West Surrey Water Company was formed. The water was abstracted from the Thames at Walton, where it was filtered and then pumped to a storage reservoir on St George&#x27;s Hill. In 1960, the company became part of the Woking and District Water Company. Today, Affinity Water is responsible for supplying the town with drinking water.

The first wastewater treatment works in the town was built at Brooklands Farm in 1895. The works were principally a series of sewage lagoons, but were upgraded in 1939 to filter beds, which were considered less conspicuous to enemy aircraft. The present works, in the triangle formed by the railway lines to the west of Weybridge station, were opened in 1973. Treated water is discharged into the River Wey.

The Walton upon Thames and Weybridge Gas Company was incorporated in 1869. It was taken over by the Wandsworth Gas Company in Oct 1936.
In 1890, Weybridge became the first town in Britain to have electric street lighting using incandescent filament bulbs. The power station in Church Walk was capable of generating 70 kW and operated for six years before its closure in 1896. In 1902, a new station was opened in Thames Street with an initial installed capacity of 180 kW, which had risen to 700 kW by the time of its closure 20 years later. From 1922, electricity was supplied to the town by the Twickenham and Teddington Electricity Supply Company.

===Emergency services===
Weybridge Fire Brigade was formed 1874 and was initially equipped with a horse-drawn, manual engine with leather hoses. In 1881 the brigade moved to new building in Balfour Road and a steam-driven fire engine was purchased in 1902. In 1921, the Weybridge brigade was made responsible for attending fires in Cobham. The merger of Weybridge and Walton UDCs in 1933, resulted in the fire brigades of the two towns being combined into one single unit. Weybridge Police Station opened 1908 and closed in 1968.

In 2021, the fire authority for Weybridge is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Ambulance services are run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service. The local police force is Surrey Police and the nearest police station to the town is at Esher.

===Healthcare===
Weybridge Cottage Hospital was opened in 1889 in Balfour Road on land belonging to Ethel Locke King. It was replaced in 1928 by a new facility on the site of Vigo House in Church Street. The hospital became part of the National Health Service in 1948 and in the early 1960s, an additional wing was constructed. In 1999, a new hospital was opened adjacent to the old, which was subsequently demolished. In July 2017, the building was destroyed by fire, most probably caused by an electrical fault.

The nearest hospital with an A&amp;E is St Peter&#x27;s Hospital, Chertsey, from Weybridge. As of 2021, the town has two GP practices, both of which are housed in the Health Centre on Church Street.

==Education==
===Early schools===
The first recorded school in Weybridge was a Dame School for 12 children, founded in Baker Street. A charity school for poor children was founded in Weybridge in 1732 by Elizabeth Hopton and was incorporated into a new Parochial School in 1813. A second small parochial school was founded on the Oatlands estate in 1862 and was enlarged in 1874 to accommodate 201 children.

===Maintained schools===

There are several Primary Schools in Weybridge. St Charles Borromeo Catholic Primary School was founded in Heath Road in 1881. It educates around 210 pupils aged from 4 to 11. Cleves School, in Oatlands Avenue, became an academy in November 2010. St James Church of England Primary School is in Grotto Road.

Heathside School, in Brooklands Lane, is a co-educational secondary school for students aged 11 to 18. It opened in 1966.

===Independent school===

St George&#x27;s College Junior School is a coeducational Catholic school for pupils aged 3 to 11. It moved from the main school campus in Addlestone to Thames Street in 2000. The site, to the north of Weybridge town centre, had previously been occupied by a school for girls, founded in 1898 by the nuns of Les Dames de St Maur.

===Further education===
Brooklands College opened in 1951 as the Brooklands Technical College. Its Weybridge campus is built around the former Brooklands House, a Grade II-listed building, which was once the home of the Locke-King family. The mansion was originally constructed in 1860, but was rebuilt by the architect, Reginald Blomfield, in a Queen Anne style in 1891.

Brooklands College merged with Spelthorne College in Ashford in 2007. It now operates across two campuses and educates over 1,600 students. Higher education courses are offered in association with Oxford Brookes and Kingston Universities.

==Places of worship==
===Early church===

There is no mention of a church at Weybridge in the Domesday Book and the first record of a place of worship is in 1175, in which a chapel in the town is listed as a dependent of Chertsey Abbey. During the Reformation, several valuable items, including chalices and a paten were seized from the Weybridge church by the King&#x27;s commissioners. The font was buried under the floor of the building at around the same time, possibly to prevent it being confiscated.

Major renovations to Weybridge church were carried out in 1722, including the construction of a south aisle. The congregation increased in size in the first half of the 19th century, as the population of the town expanded. By the middle of the century, it was clear that a larger building was required and so the church was demolished in 1848 and replaced by the present St James&#x27;. A portion of a fresco from the old church was saved and is held by Elmbridge Museum.

===St James&#x27; Church===

The Anglican parish church of St James was built in 1848 to replace the earlier church. It was designed by the architect John Loughborough Pearson in the Early English Gothic Revival style. It is constructed of coursed rubble stone with a plain tiled roof. The broach spire was completed in 1855 and the south aisle was added in 1864. The chancel is decorated in red and gold mosaics, containing more than 20 types of marble. In 1875, the church was given a ring of eight bells, cast by Taylor of Loughborough. They were re-hung on a new steel frame in 1989.

Several monuments were rescued from the medieval church and were reinstalled in St James&#x27;. The oldest is a sculpture of three skeletons, dating from around 1450, which appears to commemorate a man and two women. There are two brasses dating from the reign of Elizabeth I, which record the members of two prominent local families.

===St Charles Borromeo Catholic Church===

A Catholic Chapel was built on Weybridge Heath in the 1830s for the private use of the Taylor Family and was dedicated to St Charles Borromeo in November 1835. The chapel is constructed from brick, plastered to resemble Bath Stone and has a central dome with towers to the east and west. Following his abdication in 1848, Louis Philippe, King of France, moved with his family to Claremont, Esher. He attended mass at the chapel until his death in 1850. He and ten other members of his family were buried in the crypt, but their bodies were subsequently returned to France for reinterment.

A church adjoining the chapel was designed by the architect, Alfred Edward Purdie, and built in 1880. It served as the local Catholic Church until the congregation moved to the newly constructed Christ the Prince of Peace Church in 1989. The church was sold to the World Mission Korean Presbyterian Church in 1993 and a restoration project was awarded funding by English Heritage in 2005.

===Christ the Prince of Peace Catholic Church===
Christ the Prince of Peace Catholic Church opened in Advent 1989, succeeding St Charles Borromeo and the demolished St Martin de Porres. The benches, statues and the crucifix over the altar were recovered from the old churches and installed in the new church.

===Weybridge United Reformed Church===

The Nonconformist community in Weybridge traces its origins to 1855, when Congregational services were conducted in a hired cottage in Thames Street for a short period. Five years later, Benjamin Scott, the Chamberlain of the City of London began to hold open-air services in the town.

The foundation stone of Weybridge United Reformed Church was laid on 4 July 1864 by John Remington Mills. The church, designed in the mixed style by John Tarring, was opened the following year. The building is constructed of rubble masonry, dressed with ashlar, and has a square tower with a hexagonal spire. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described the appearance of the church as &quot;ferocious&quot;.

===St Mary Oatlands===

St Mary Oatlands was founded as a chapel in the Parish of Walton-on-Thames in 1867, but two years later, became a church with its own parish. Extensions to the original structure include the tower, built in 1905, and the Chapel of the Resurrection, built in 1920.

===Weybridge Methodist Church===
Weybridge Methodist Church was designed by the architect, Josiah Gunton, and the foundation stone was laid in June 1900. The adjacent Hayfield Hall was built in 1937. The church was severely damaged by fire in 1977, but was reopened in 1980.

===North West Surrey Synagogue===
The first Jewish congregation in Weybridge began meeting in the late 1930s in Finnart House, a school for Jewish boys. North West Surrey Synagogue was founded there in 1968, but moved to new premises in Princes Road in 1981. Four years later, the congregation relocated to its current home, Horvath Close, named in honour of one of the founding members, Imre Horvath. In 2021, the synagogue is affiliated to the Movement for Reform Judaism.

==Culture==
===Art===

&quot;The Thames at Weybridge&quot; painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1805–6 is held by the Tate. The Elmbridge Museum collection includes works by Charles Claude Houssard (1884–1958), Edwin Lock (active 1929–1961), and Nancy Wallis. Guildford House Gallery holds two riverside views of Weybridge by Winifred Schofield (d. 2000). Brooklands Museum holds a number of artworks that reference the area&#x27;s motor racing and aviation heritage.

===Literature===

Several authors have lived in Weybridge. The writer George Meredith moved to the town with his first wife in 1849. Whilst living at Weybridge he wrote &quot;The Shaving of Shagpat: An Arabian Entertainment&quot;, his first work of fiction, which was published in 1856. He moved to Box Hill in 1868. Following the Dreyfus affair, the French novelist Émile Zola (1840–1902) was exiled to England from July 1898 to June 1899, during which time he lived at the Oatlands Park Hotel. The novelist E. M. Forster (1879–1970) lived at 19 Monument Green from 1904 until 1912, during which he wrote all six of his novels. A plaque recording his residence in Weybridge was installed on the outside wall of his former home in the 1980s. The novelist Warwick Deeping lived on Brooklands Lane from 1918 until his death in 1950.

The town is mentioned in several works of literature. Chapter 12 of H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897) is entitled &quot;What I saw of the destruction of Weybridge and Shepperton&quot;. During the chapter, an armoured Martian is disabled by an artillery shell and collapses into the River Thames. In John Wyndham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; (1953), the main characters are stopped in their attempt to reach Cornwall on a dinghy through a flooded England in the &quot;Staines-Weybridge area&quot;. In Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988), Weybridge is referred to by one of Saladin Chamcha&#x27;s interrogators as his place of residence.

===Music===
The rock band, You Me at Six, was formed in Weybridge in 2004. Four members of the group attended Brooklands College. Amateur choirs rehearsing and performing regularly in the town include the Treble Clef Choir for ladies&#x27; voices and the Weybridge Male Voice Choir.

==Sport and leisure==
===Cricket===

Weybridge Cricket Club was formed in 1924, by the merger of two existing clubs, the oldest of which was founded before 1870. Cricket is thought to have been played on Weybridge Green since at least 1814. In 1921, the UDC improved the ground by levelling the surface and the surrounding banking.

Weybridge Vandals Cricket Club traces its origins to two clubs formed in the early 20th century. Brownacres Cricket Club was founded in 1938, but changed its name to University Vandalls CC in 1953. In 1975, it merged with the Olinda CC, which had been formed in 1924.

===Golf===

St George&#x27;s Hill Golf Course was designed by the architect Harry Colt and the first 18 holes opened in 1913. The course was constructed on land owned by W. G. Tarrant, who intended the course to complement the surrounding housing development. The original club house was burnt down in March 1920 and was replaced the same year. The future Edward VIII was president of the club from 1934 to 1935 and his brother the future George VI was also a member. The German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, visited the club in 1937. A second 18-hole course, also designed by Colt, was opened in 1929, but was reduced to nine holes in 1946.

Silvermere Golf Course was designed by Neil Coles and Brian Huggett and opened in 1976. The 18-hole course surrounds Silvermere Lake, where Barnes Wallace tested prototypes of his bouncing bomb. Both the 17th and 18th holes require golfers to play the ball across the surface of the lake.

===Rowing===

Weybridge Rowing Club was founded in 1881 and moved to its current premises, adjacent to Thames Lock, in 1910. Women were first admitted as members in 1910. Weybridge Ladies Amateur Rowing Club was founded by Amy Gentry in 1926. Weyfarers Rowing Club for recreational rowers was founded in September 2000.

The Weybridge Community Regatta, organised by Weybridge Rowing Club, takes place on the Desborough Cut each summer. The club has hosted the Weybridge Silver Sculls head since 1956. The race takes place on a course on the Thames. The Weybridge Veterans&#x27; Head is held each year in March and includes events for juniors as well as veterans.

===Rugby===

Weybridge Vandals RFC was founded in 1932 for members of the University of London. It was initially known as &quot;London University Vandals RFC&quot; and played its home matches at Motspur Park. A vulture taking off with wings raised was adopted as the club symbol. The club moved to the premises of a former private zoo on Desborough Island in 1932 and, in 2003, changed its name to Weybridge Vandals RFC to reflect the location of its home ground.

===Shooting===
Weybridge Rifle and Pistol Club was opened in 1901. Initially the range was at Brooklands Farm, but relocated in 1906 to allow for the construction of the racing circuit. In 2021, the club has a 100-yard outdoor range for .22 calibre rifles and a 25-yard outdoor air gun range.

===Tennis===
St George&#x27;s Hill Lawn Tennis Club was opened in 1913. It covers and has 33 courts, of which 13 are grass courts. It also offers four squash courts and facilities for badminton and table tennis.

Weybridge Lawn Tennis Club, in Walton Lane, offers five outdoor courts.

==Tourist attractions==
===Brooklands Museum===
As aircraft manufacture at Brooklands began to decline in the 1970s, BAC closed the factory buildings on the west side of the runway and the area was redeveloped for light industry, offices and retail units. The corporation also vacated a site at the northern end of the former finishing straight, 30 acres of which became the Brooklands Museum. The museum, which opened in 1991, has preserved several historic buildings including the 1911 Ticket Office, the 1932 Aero Clubhouse and a section of track. A wide range of vintage aircraft, racing cars and motorcycles is on display, including Concorde G-BBDG, a Wellington Bomber and a 1927 Delage 15-S8 Grand Prix racing car.

===London Bus Museum===
The London Bus Museum traces its origins to the mid-1960s, when the London Bus Preservation Group was formed by a number of private heritage vehicle owners. Eight years later, the group purchased a former factory in Cobham, Surrey, which was converted to a museum, opening in 1974. In 2011, the museum moved to a newly constructed building on the Brooklands Museum site. Around 30 buses dating from the 1820s to the 1970s are on public display at any one time, around two thirds of which are owned by the London Bus Preservation Trust and the remainder by private individuals. Entry to the museum is via a combined ticket with the Brooklands Museum.

===Mercedes-Benz World===
The German car manufacturer, Daimler AG, purchased the former Brooklands runway and the adjacent strips of land in 2002. The northern half of the site was redeveloped into a tourist attraction, Mercedes-Benz World, which was opened in October 2006. The southern half was handed to Elmbridge Borough Council and became the Brooklands Community Park. As part of the work to construct the new attraction, the section of the motor racing circuit adjacent to the railway was restored and a new car park and entrance to the Brooklands Museum were provided. Among the exhibits at Mercedes-Benz World are a number of historic racing and road cars and the attraction offers racing simulators and driving experiences.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Memorial to Gerrard Winstanley===

The memorial to Gerrard Winstanley, located close to the railway station, was unveiled in December 2000. It commemorates the radical leader of the Diggers or True Levellers, a group of 17th-century religious dissidents, who set up an encampment on St George&#x27;s Hill. The group began to cultivate the common land on the hill in April 1649, encouraging others to join them and declaring their intention to reclaim enclosed land. The group published several pamphlets and their philosophy has been compared to agrarian socialism and modern anarchism. Following harassment from local landowners and threats of legal action, the Diggers relocated to Little Heath, Cobham that August, but had been driven from the land by April 1650.

===Oatlands Park Hotel===

Following the demolition of Oatlands Palace in the mid-17th century, the surrounding hunting park passed through a series of owners until it was inherited by Henry Clinton, 7th Earl of Lincoln in 1716. Clinton remodelled the estate, creating a new garden in 1725 and constructing a new house to the east of the town centre in 1725. The property was purchased by Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany in around 1790. Four years later, much of the house was destroyed by fire and a new mansion, Oatlands Park, was designed by Henry Holland on the same site. It was built in the Italianate style using yellow London stock bricks, but the original entrance gateway, designed in the mid-18th century by William Kent, was retained.

The Duke of York sold Oatlands Park to Edward Hughes Ball Hughes in 1824, following the death of his wife four years earlier. Hughes was responsible for remodelling the house in 1827, but financial problems forced him to lease the estate to William Egerton, 1st Baron Egerton a year later. The land was sold in 1846 and, in 1856, Oatlands Park became a hotel, when the west wing was added by the architect, Thomas Henry Wyatt.

The Broad Water, also known as Broadwater Lake, is located between the Oatlands Park Hotel and the River Thames. It is shown as a cruciform canal on a 1737 plan of the Oatlands estate by the cartographer, John Roque, and is thought to have been enlarged to its current form by 1770. Today, the lake runs in a shallow arc from west to north east and is fed by springs close to St George&#x27;s Junior School. It was constructed as a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; and its east end appears to flow under Walton Bridge, which in fact spans the River Thames. A new footpath along the northern bank of the lake was opened in 2017.

===Ship Hotel===
Parts of the Ship Hotel on Monument Green are thought to date from the 16th century. Its original name, the Ship Inn, may derive from &quot;shippin&quot; meaning a cattle shed. In the mid-18th century, the inn was used for meetings of the manorial courts and during the Napoleonic Wars, it served as a recruiting centre for the army.

===War memorial===

The war memorial, designed by J. Hatchard Smith, was erected in 1923 at the south end of Monument Hill. It consists of a square column, on which a statue of a soldier is standing at ease. A total of 224 people who died in the First World War, Second World War and Korean War are commemorated.

===Yool Memorial===
The stone drinking fountain at the junction of Hanger Hill and Princes Road was commissioned from the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1896. It commemorates Henry Yool, a local benefactor and former vice-chairman of Surrey County Council. Originally erected on Weybridge Hill, the memorial was moved to its current location in 1971.

===York Column===
The York Column on Monument Green originally stood at Seven Dials in central London. The sundial pillar was commissioned by Thomas Neale in the 1690s to form the centrepiece of his housing development near Covent Garden. The monument was dismantled in 1777 and the stones were purchased by the architect, James Paine, who lived in Addlestone. In 1822 the column was erected on Monument Green in Weybridge as a memorial to the Duchess of York, who had lived at Oatlands House and who had died two years previously. The badly weathered dialstone was not reinstalled on the monument and can be seen adjacent to Weybridge Library.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Brooklands Community Park===
The Brooklands Community Park was opened in 2006 on land donated by Daimler AG to Elmbridge Borough Council. The formal recreation areas, which include a children&#x27;s playground, multi-use games area, skatepark and an off-road cycle course, total approximately . The remainder of the park is naturalised dry-acid grassland, which provides a habitat for plants including hoary cinquefoil and yellow rattle, as well as butterfly species such as the small copper and common blue. Brooklands Parkrun takes place at the Community Park on Saturday mornings.

===Churchfields recreation ground===
Churchfields recreation ground was opened by Weybridge Council in 1908, on land donated by John Lyle.

===Monument Green===

Monument Green is an area of common land at the north end of the High Street, surrounding the junction between Thames Street and Monument Hill. In the 18th century, it was known as the &quot;Bull Ring&quot; and bull-baiting is thought to have taken place there. In the early 19th century, the village pump was located on the western side, in front of the Ship Hotel. The York Column was erected in the centre of the green in 1822. Most of the houses in the surrounding area were constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Weybridge Heath===

Weybridge Heath, to the south of the town centre, was reserved for the use of local residents under the Inclosure Act 1800. Some are owned by Elmbridge Borough Council.

===Whittet&#x27;s Ait===
Whittet&#x27;s Ait is an island between the River Wey and River Wey Navigation in the north of Weybridge. It is named after the owner of the former oil seed mill, which was sited next to Thames Lock. Elmbridge Borough Council acquired the publicly accessible open land on the ait in 2000, to protect it for recreational use.

<text>Weybridge Heath is a part of Weybridge common, in South East England.

The Heath comprises of lowland heathland that runs from the deep cutting of the South West Main Line railway eastwards to Cobbetts Hill. To the west of the railway line, much of the original heathland is now occupied by Heathside School and Brooklands College.

During the 1970s and 1980s the heathland fell into a poor state of repair because the surrounding brush was ill-maintained and coppicing, which is essential for the maintenance of small heaths, had ceased. Gradually, the area became more and more overgrown with newly grown brush composed of the saplings of deciduous trees, and became to resemble more of a young wood.

Because the area used to contain many species of ants, rare birds and insectivorous plants, Surrey County Council embarked in 1989 upon a project to renew the heathland and encourage the return of the area to its original habitat type. The project consisted of the removal of many taller trees from a central portion of the site, and the clearing of brush from this area. The council hoped that the area would be returned to something approaching its former glory within a decade.

Evidence of the re-growth of heathland is not great as of 2003, and some local residents are sceptical about the apparent defacement of the area, dubbing the cleared area &quot;the bomb site&quot;.

It was on the original heath in this location that British myrmecologist Horace Donisthorpe collected many of the ants from which he produced so many observations and deductions.

<text>The Persians (, &quot;Persai&quot;, Latinised as &quot;Persae&quot;) is an ancient Greek tragedy written during the Classical period of Ancient Greece by the Greek tragedian Aeschylus. It is the second and only surviving part of a now otherwise lost trilogy that won the first prize at the dramatic competitions in Athens&#x27; City Dionysia festival in 472 BC, with Pericles serving as &quot;choregos&quot;.

==Place in Aeschylus&#x27; work==
The first play in the trilogy, called &quot;Phineus&quot;, presumably dealt with Jason and the Argonauts&#x27; rescue of King Phineus from the torture that the monstrous harpies inflicted at the behest of Zeus. The subject of the third play, &quot;Glaucus&quot;, was either a mythical Corinthian king who was devoured by his horses because he angered the goddess Aphrodite (see Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)) or else a Boeotian farmer who ate a magical herb that transformed him into a sea deity with the gift of prophecy (see Glaucus).

In &quot;The Persians&quot;, Xerxes invites the gods&#x27; enmity for his hubristic expedition against Greece in 480/79 BC; the focus of the drama is the defeat of Xerxes&#x27; navy at Salamis. Given Aeschylus&#x27; propensity for writing connected trilogies, the theme of divine retribution may connect the three. Aeschylus himself had fought the Persians at Marathon (490 BC). He may even have fought at Salamis, just eight years before the play was performed.

The satyr play following the trilogy was &quot;Prometheus Pyrkaeus&quot;, translated as either &quot;Prometheus the Fire-lighter&quot; or &quot;Prometheus the Fire-kindler&quot;, which comically portrayed the titan&#x27;s theft of fire. Several fragments of &quot;Prometheus Pyrkaeus&quot; are extant, and according to Plutarch, one of those fragments was a statement by Prometheus warning a satyr who wanted to kiss and embrace the fire that he would &quot;mourn for his beard&quot; if he did. Another fragment from &quot;Prometheus Pyrkaeus&quot; was translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as &quot;And do thou guard thee well lest a blast strike thy face; for it is sharp, and deadly-scorching its hot breaths&quot;.

==Summary==
The Persians takes place in Susa, which at the time was one of the capitals of the Persian Empire, and opens with a chorus of old men of Susa, who are soon joined by the Queen Mother, Atossa, as they await news of her son King Xerxes&#x27; expedition against the Greeks. Expressing her anxiety and unease, Atossa narrates &quot;what is probably the first dream sequence in European theatre.&quot; This is an unusual beginning for a tragedy by Aeschylus; normally the chorus would not appear until slightly later, after a speech by a minor character. An exhausted messenger arrives, who offers a graphic description of the Battle of Salamis and its gory outcome. He tells of the Persian defeat, the names of the Persian generals who have been killed, and that Xerxes had escaped and is returning. The climax of the messenger&#x27;s speech is his rendition of the battle cry of the Greeks as they charged:
In the original, this reads:

At the tomb of her dead husband Darius, Atossa asks the chorus to summon his ghost: &quot;Some remedy he knows, perhaps,/Knows ruin&#x27;s cure&quot; they say. On learning of the Persian defeat, Darius condemns the hubris behind his son&#x27;s decision to invade Greece. He particularly rebukes an impious Xerxes’ decision to build a bridge over the Hellespont to expedite the Persian army&#x27;s advance. Before departing, the ghost of Darius prophesies another Persian defeat at the Battle of Plataea (479 BC): &quot;Where the plain grows lush and green,/Where Asopus&#x27; stream plumps rich Boeotia&#x27;s soil,/The mother of disasters awaits them there,/Reward for insolence, for scorning God.&quot; Xerxes finally arrives, dressed in torn robes (&quot;grief swarms,&quot; the Queen says just before his arrival, &quot;but worst of all it stings / to hear how my son, my prince, / wears tatters, rags&quot; (845–849)) and reeling from his crushing defeat. The rest of the drama (908–1076) consists of the king alone with the chorus engaged in a lyrical &quot;kommós&quot; that laments the enormity of Persia&#x27;s defeat.

==Discussion==
Aeschylus was not the first to write a play about the Persians — his older contemporary Phrynichus wrote two plays about them. The first, &quot;The Sack of Miletus&quot; (written in 493 BC, 21 years before Aeschylus&#x27; play), concerned the destruction of an Ionian colony of Athens in Asia Minor by the Persians. For his portrayal of this brutal defeat, which emphasized Athens&#x27; abandonment of its colony, Phrynichus was fined and a law passed forbidding subsequent performances of his play. The second, &quot;Phoenician Women&quot; (written in 476 BC, four years before Aeschylus&#x27; version), treated the same historical event as Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Persians&quot;. Neither of Phrynichus&#x27; plays have survived.

Interpretations of &quot;Persians&quot; either read the play as sympathetic toward the defeated Persians or else as a celebration of Greek victory within the context of an ongoing war. The sympathetic school has the considerable weight of Aristotelian criticism behind it; indeed, every other extant Greek tragedy arguably invites an audience&#x27;s sympathy for one or more characters on stage. The celebratory school argues that the play is part of a xenophobic culture that would find it difficult to sympathize with its hated barbarian enemy during a time of war. During the play, Xerxes calls his pains &quot;a joy to my enemies&quot; (line 1034).

==Subsequent production history==

According to a scholium at Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Frogs&quot; 1028, Hiero of Syracuse at some point invited Aeschylus to reproduce &quot;The Persians&quot; in Sicily.

Seventy years after the play was produced, the comic playwright Aristophanes mentions an apparent Athenian reproduction of &quot;The Persians&quot; in his &quot;Frogs&quot; (405 BC). In it, he has Aeschylus describe &quot;The Persians&quot; as &quot;an effective sermon on the will to win. Best thing I ever wrote&quot;; while Dionysus says that he &quot;loved that bit where they sang about the days of the great Darius, and the chorus went like this with their hands and cried &#x27;Wah! Wah!&#x27;&quot; (1026–28).

&quot;The Persians&quot; was popular in the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, who also fought wars with the Persians, and its popularity has endured in modern Greece. According to Anthony Podlecki, during a production at Athens in 1965 the audience &quot;rose to its feet en masse and interrupted the actors&#x27; dialogue with cheers.&quot;

The American Peter Sellars directed an important production of &quot;The Persians&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival and Los Angeles Festival in 1993, which articulated the play as a response to the Gulf War of 1990–1991. The production was in a new translation by Robert Auletta. It opened at the Royal Lyceum Theatre on 16 August 1993. Hamza El Din composed and performed its music, with additional music by Ben Halley Jr. and sound design by Bruce Odland and Sam Auinger. Dunya Ramicova designed the costumes and James F. Ingalls the lighting. Cordelia Gonzalez played Atossa, Howie Seago the Ghost of Darius, and John Ortiz played Xerxes. The Chorus was performed by Ben Halley Jr, Joseph Haj, and Martinus Miroto.

Ellen McLaughlin translated &quot;Persians&quot; in 2003 for Tony Randall&#x27;s National Actors Theatre in New York as a response to George Bush&#x27;s invasion of Iraq. The production starred Len Cariou as Darius and Michael Stuhlbarg as Xerxes. 

A 2010 translation by Aaron Poochigian included for the first time the detailed notes for choral odes that Aeschylus himself created, which directed lines to be spoken by specific parts of the chorus (strophe and antistrophe). Using Poochigian&#x27;s edition, which includes theatrical notes and stage directions, &quot;Persians&quot; was presented in a staged read-through as part of New York&#x27;s WorkShop Theater Company&#x27;s Spring 2011 one-act festival &quot;They That Have Borne the Battle.&quot;

Also in 2010, Kaite O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s award-winning translation was produced on Sennybridge Training Area (a military range in the Brecon Beacons) by National Theatre Wales. Audiences valued the way this production required them to shift their attention between the spectacular landscape surrounding them, the particular history of the area, and the modern adaptation of the ancient Greek text performed onstage. The work went on to win O&#x27;Reilly the Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry, presented by the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy.

Οn the occasion of the 2500th anniversary of the Battle of Salamis, on July 25, 2020, &quot;Persians&quot; was the first Ancient Greek tragedy that was played at its natural environment, i.e. the open-air theatre of Epidaurus, and was live streamed internationally via YouTube. The play was a production of the Hellenic National Theatre and was directed by Dimitrios Lignadis as part of the Epidaurus Festival. Actors delivered the play in Ancient and Modern Greek, while English subtitles were projected on YouTube.

The play is currently in production as one of a double bill in the 2022 Cambridge Greek Play.

In March 2024 Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre staged the first Irish language translation of the play by poet Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill.

==Influence==
Aeschylus&#x27; drama was a model for Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s 1821 &quot;Hellas: A Lyrical Drama&quot;, his final published poetical work before his death in 1822. T. S. Eliot, in &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, &quot;The Burial of the Dead&quot;, line 63 &quot;&quot;I had not thought Death had undone so many&quot; echoes line 432 of the Messenger account in &quot;The Persians&quot;: &quot;However, you can be sure that so great a multitude of men never perished in a single day&quot;&quot;, which is also similar to Dante&#x27;s line in &quot;Inferno&quot;, Canto III, lines 56–57: &quot;ch&#x27;i&#x27; non averei creduto/Che morte tanta n&#x27;avesse disfatta&quot;.

In modern literature, Dimitris Lyacos in his dystopian epic &quot;Z213: Exit&quot; uses quotations from the Messenger&#x27;s account in &quot;The Persians&quot; (&quot;δίψῃ πονοῦντες, οἱ δ᾽ ὑπ᾽ ἄσθματος κενοὶ: some, faint from thirst, while some of us, exhausted and panting&quot;) in order to convey the failure of a military operation and the subsequent retreat of the troops in a post-apocalyptic setting. The excerpts from &quot;The Persians&quot; enter a context of fragmentation whereby broken syntax is evocative of a landscape in the aftermath of war.

<doc id="327454" wikidata="Q19630" url="?curid=327454" title="Greater prairie-chicken">
<text>The greater prairie-chicken or pinnated grouse (Tympanuchus cupido), sometimes called a boomer, is a large bird in the grouse family. This North American species was once abundant but has become extremely rare or extirpated over much of its range due to habitat loss, natural disasters, and overhunting. Conservation measures are underway to ensure the sustainability of existing small populations. One of the most famous aspects of these creatures is the mating ritual called booming.

==Taxonomy==
The greater prairie-chicken was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao cupido&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;Le Cocq de bois d&#x27;Amerique&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. Catesby had seen greater prairie-chickens in 1743 at the home of the Earl of Wilmington in the then village of Chiswick, west of London. The Earl believed that that his birds had come from North America but did not know from where. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Virginia but this has been changed to Pennsylvania by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The specific epithet &quot;cupido&quot; was chosen as the erectile neck feathers were thought to resemble the wings of Cupid. The greater prairie-chicken is now placed together with the sharp-tailed grouse and the lesser prairie-chicken in the genus &quot;Tympanuchus&quot; that was introduced in 1841 by the German zoologist Constantin Gloger.

Three subspecies are recognised:
==Description==
Adults of both sexes are medium to large chicken-like birds, stocky with round wings. They have short tails which are typically rounded. Adult males have orange comb-like feathers over their eyes and dark, elongated head feathers that can be raised or lain along neck. They also possess a circular, un-feathered neck patch which can be inflated while displaying; this, like their comb feathers, is also orange. As with many other bird species, the adult females have shorter head feathers and also lack the male&#x27;s yellow comb and orange neck patch. Adults are about long, and weigh between . The greater prairie-chicken has a wingspan range of .

==Distribution and habitat==
The greater prairie-chicken prefers undisturbed prairie and was originally found in tallgrass prairies. It can tolerate agricultural land mixed with prairie, but sparser population density is found in areas that are more agricultural. Its diet consists primarily of seeds and fruit, but during the summer it also eats green plants and insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles. This species was once widespread all across the oak savanna and tall grass prairie ecosystem.

==Conservation==
A steamboat captain recalled seeing great flocks of prairie chickens at Bird&#x27;s Point in 1840, writing &quot;Then we gazed in wonderment, but very soon our eyes were drawn to something more attractive which caused us to forget the great river. The whole banks or sandbars on either river were a mass of quail or partridges. I have never in my life seen such a grand sight. They had come from the prairies to the river, but unable to fly across either stream there they were by the millions running up and down each river until they had made paths and roads. We killed a great many with sticks and clubs and took them to the boat. We met Dick Bird, the man this point took its name from, and he said we could look for a cold winter, as the quails and prairie chickens were leaving the prairies and trying to get south to escape the cold.&quot;

The greater prairie-chicken was almost extinct in the 1930s due to hunting pressure and habitat loss. In Illinois alone, in the 1800s, the prairie-chicken numbered in the millions. It was a popular game bird, and like many prairie birds, which have also suffered massive habitat loss, it is now on the verge of extinction, with the wild bird population at around 200 in Illinois in 2019. It now only lives on small parcels of managed prairie land. Throughout North America, it is thought that their current population has declined severely, to approximately 500,000 individuals. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the greater prairie-chicken as extirpated in its Canadian range (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario). It was again confirmed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in November 2009. Nonetheless, sightings and encounters continue to occur in the south-central regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan, along with southern Ontario, where sightings are extremely rare.

In states such as Iowa and Missouri that once had thriving prairie-chicken populations (estimated to be hundreds of thousands), total numbers have dropped to about 500. However, the Missouri Department of Conservation has started a program to import prairie-chickens from Kansas and Nebraska in the hopes that they will be able to repopulate the state and increase that number to 3,000.

Central Wisconsin is home to approximately 600 individuals, down from 55,000 when hunting was prohibited in 1954. Though this area was predominately spruce and tamarack marsh before European settlement, early pioneers drained the marshes and attempted to farm the poor soil. As the prairies to the south and west were lost to agriculture and development, and the southern half of Wisconsin was logged, the prairies spread northward into the abandoned farmland. Today, over 30,000 acres are managed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as greater prairie-chicken habitat. Birdwatchers travel from around the world to visit Wisconsin in April for the Central Wisconsin Prairie Chicken Festival, started in 2006 by Golden Sands Resource Conservation &amp; Development Council, Inc.

=== Conservation of subspecies ===
The Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken is one of the most endangered endemic species of the United States, its biggest threats are habitat loss caused by industrialisation and natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey. Captive-breeding programmes have been established at the Fossil Ram Wildlife Center, Abeline Zoo, Caldwell Zoo, Houston Zoo, and NASA.

There were many conservation efforts to save the heath hen. The biggest threats towards the subspecies were overhunting due to perceived overabundance, predation from invasive species such as feral cats, and natural disasters. As early as 1791, bills were passed to protect the species but were poorly enforced. By 1870, the heath hen was extirpated from mainland North America, leaving a relict population of 300 individuals on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. In 1908 the &quot;Heath Hen Reserve&quot; (Now the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest) was established as a last ditch effort to save the remaining birds. By late 1928, only one male individual remained, Booming Ben, the endling of the subspecies. Booming Ben was last seen in March 1932, with his disappearance marking the extinction of his subspecies.

There is an ongoing project to potentially revive the heath hen through genome editing and reintroduce it to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The project is carried out by American non-profit, Revive &amp; Restore.

==Threats==
Habitat loss is the greatest historical threat to prairie-chicken populations. More than 95% of all tallgrass prairie in the United States has been converted to cropland. The conversion of native prairie to cropland is very detrimental to these birds. It was found in a radio telemetry study conducted by Kansas State University that &quot;most prairie-chicken hens avoided nesting or rearing their broods within a quarter-mile of power lines and within a third-mile of improved roads.&quot; (Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks) It was also found that the prairie-chickens avoided communication towers and rural farms.

Studies have found mesopredators such as striped skunks, raccoons, and opossums significantly increase egg mortality; experimental removal of these predators increased nesting success from 33% to 82%. Loss of apex predators such as bears, wolves, and mountain lions results in increased populations of these mesopredators, and therefore reduces populations of prairie-chickens, an example of a top-down trophic cascade. Non-native common pheasants also reduce prairie-chicken reproduction through nest parasitism.

The small size of some isolated prairie-chicken populations in the Eastern portion of the range resulted in a population bottleneck, which reduced the genetic diversity and ultimately survival of offspring. In Illinois, wildlife management included the &quot;genetic rescue&quot; of small and potentially inbred populations by introducing birds from other areas.

==Sexual behavior==

Greater prairie-chickens do not migrate. They are territorial birds and often defend their booming grounds. These booming grounds are the area in which they perform their displays in hopes of attracting females. Their displays consist of inflating air sacs located on the side of their neck and snapping their tails. These booming grounds usually have very short or no vegetation. The male prairie-chickens stay on this ground displaying for almost two months. The breeding season usually begins in the United States starting in late March and throughout April. During this time the males establish booming sites where they display for the females. The one or two most dominant males can obtain 90% of mating opportunities. Due to their now small populations and habitat fragmentation the greater prairie-chickens often undergo inbreeding causing observable inbreeding depression: with fewer offspring and a decreased survival rate within these limited offspring further aiding their population decrease.

After mating has taken place, the females move about one mile from the booming grounds and begin to build their nests. Hens lay between 5 and 17 eggs per clutch and the eggs take between 23 and 24 days to hatch. There are between five and 10 young per brood. The young are raised by the female and fledge in one to four weeks, are completely independent by the tenth to twelfth week, and reach sexual maturity by age one (Ammann, 1957). A study of female greater prairie-chickens in Kansas found that their survival rates were 1.6 to 2.0 times higher during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season; this was due to heavy predation during nesting and brood-rearing. One problem facing prairie-chickens is competition with the ring-necked pheasants. Pheasants lay their eggs in prairie-chicken nests. The pheasant eggs hatch first; this causes the prairie-chickens to leave the nest thinking that the young have hatched. In reality, prairie-chicken eggs do not hatch and the young usually die due to lack of incubation.

<text>Mary Joe Matalin (born August 19, 1953) is an American political consultant well known for her work with the Republican Party. She served under President Ronald Reagan, was campaign director for George H. W. Bush, an assistant to President George W. Bush, and until 2003 counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney. Matalin has been chief editor of Threshold Editions, a conservative publishing imprint at Simon &amp; Schuster, since March 2005. She is married to Democratic political consultant James Carville. She appears in the award-winning documentary film &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot; and played herself, opposite her husband James Carville, John Slattery, and Mary McCormack in the short-lived HBO series &quot;K Street&quot;.

On May 5, 2016, Matalin announced she changed her party registration to Libertarian.

==Early life==
Matalin grew up in the Chicago suburb of Burnham, the daughter of Eileen (née Emerson), who ran beauty salons, and Steven Matalin, a steel mill worker. Her paternal grandparents were Croatian immigrants and her mother was of Irish descent. Matalin originally intended to follow her mother into the beauty salon profession, and briefly considered becoming a model. Instead, Matalin attended Thornton Fractional North High School and attended Western Illinois University for college and Hofstra University School of Law, where she dropped out after one year.

==Career==
Matalin&#x27;s first campaign was Illinois Lieutenant Governor Dave O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s bid for the U.S. Senate in 1980, a race O&#x27;Neal lost to Alan Dixon. After O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s loss, Matalin began her career with the Republican National Committee, where she would remain for nearly two decades as a key Republican strategist. Leaving briefly to attend Hofstra University School of Law, Matalin dropped out after just one year, and in 1984 returned to the RNC. She rose quickly, as an aide to Richard Bond and Chief of Staff to RNC co-Chairperson Betty Heitman in 1985. A year later, Matalin gained national attention when she joined George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign, working as both Deputy Political Director and Midwest Regional Political Director in the primaries. After the election, Matalin was appointed Chief of Staff to then RNC Chairman Lee Atwater. In that capacity, she would in effect run the RNC for nearly a year, as Atwater—his health declining due to an inoperable brain tumor—spent 170 days in the hospital between his diagnosis in early March 1990 and eventual death on March 29, 1991.

In 1992, Matalin served as the deputy campaign manager for political operations on Bush&#x27;s reelection campaign. Ironically, she served in this role while dating her future husband, James Carville, who was chief strategist for the Clinton campaign.

Matalin was a host of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; political debate show, and in 1993, she co-hosted &quot;Equal Time&quot;, which aired on the CNBC business television channel. Matalin was also the host of her own talk radio show in the 1990s, &quot;The Mary Matalin Show&quot;, which was carried on the CBS Radio Network. She is currently on the nationally syndicated radio program &quot;Both Sides Now w/ Huffington &amp; Matalin&quot;, hosted by Mark Green and aired weekends on 120 stations.

Matalin worked in various roles in the George W. Bush administration. She resigned on December 31, 2002.

Matalin also appeared alongside her husband James Carville in HBO&#x27;s 2003 television show &quot;K Street&quot; where she and her husband played versions of themselves as they lobbied real and fictional politicians. The show was directed by Academy Award winner Steven Soderbergh and featured a cast of fictional and real characters working in the political sphere.

In March 2005, Matalin was hired as chief editor of a new conservative publishing imprint, Threshold Editions, for CBS-owned Simon &amp; Schuster. On August 1, 2008, this division released &quot;The Obama Nation&quot;, written by Jerome Corsi, who co-authored &quot;Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry&quot;. Other notable titles published by Threshold Editions includes Dick Cheney&#x27;s &quot;In My Time&quot;, Karl Rove&#x27;s &quot;Courage and Consequence&quot; and a number of Glenn Beck books including &quot;Cowards&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In April 2006, she was appointed Treasurer of Virginia Republican Senator George Allen&#x27;s re-election committee. She worked on the presidential campaign of Fred Thompson until January 2008, when Thompson dropped out of the race.

In 2008, Matalin joined the Board of Directors at The George Washington University&#x27;s Cheney Cardiovascular Institute. Matalin also serves on numerous other boards including The Water Institute of the Gulf (TWIG), Conscience Cause, The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (NOJO) and the Tulane President&#x27;s Council.

Matalin appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on Lee Atwater, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;. Speaking about Lee, she says, &quot;They had to kill the messenger because they couldn&#x27;t kill the message. They had to turn him into the Boogie Man. Satan incarnate.&quot;

On April 26, 2009, Matalin returned to CNN as a political contributor, joining her husband, James Carville on a special &quot;First 100 Days&quot; edition of &quot;State of the Union with John King&quot;.

In 2010, Matalin and husband James Carville were named co-chairs of Super Bowl XLVII Host Committee, held in 2013 in New Orleans.

In 2012, Matalin and husband Carville began appearing together in &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; commercials for Maker&#x27;s Mark Kentucky Straight Bourbon.

Believing that farm animals should be treated humanely, Matalin teamed up with PETA to produce a video in 2013, encouraging Indiana lawmakers to vote against &quot;ag-gag&quot; bills that would ban unapproved videotaping on farms and businesses.

On May 5, 2016, Matalin announced she has changed her party registration to Libertarian, as that party represents her &quot;Jeffersonian, Madisonian [...] constitutional principles&quot; better than the Republican Party, after the GOP lost two successive presidential elections and was &quot;falling apart.&quot; While maintaining the change was not because of Donald Trump becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, she criticized Trump for &quot;his high school boy antics with women.&quot; She endorsed Austin Petersen for president in May 2016.

She was named PETA&#x27;s &quot;Person of the Year&quot; in December 2016. The organization cited her willingness to fight for the humane treatment of monkeys and farm animals, and &quot;for setting a tremendous example of compassion that all Americans can follow.&quot;

==Personal life==
On November 25, 1993 (Thanksgiving Day), Matalin married James Carville, a political strategist for candidates of the Democratic Party, in New Orleans. They have two daughters.

Matalin and Carville have gone on record saying they do not talk politics at home. The best example of contention between the two, aside from appearances on talk shows, is the portrayal of their relationship in the 1993 movie &quot;The War Room&quot;. In the 1992 political campaign, Matalin and Carville were staffing opposing campaigns. Matalin wrote the best-selling book &quot;All&#x27;s Fair: Love, War and Running for President&quot; with Carville and co-author Peter Knobler. In April 2004, she published the book &quot;Letters to My Daughters&quot;. In 2008, Carville and Matalin moved their family to New Orleans. On April 26, 2009, &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; carried a joint op-ed &quot;Point of View&quot; by Matalin and Carville on their reasons for settling in New Orleans. Matalin and Carville are profiled in the Politics chapter of the book &quot;The Compatibility Matrix&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In the 2018 film &quot;Vice&quot;, Matalin is portrayed by Camille Harman.

<text>The horned lark or shore lark (Eremophila alpestris) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found across the northern hemisphere. It is known as &quot;horned lark&quot; in North America and &quot;shore lark&quot; in Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The horned lark was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Alauda alpestris&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the description and illustration by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that was published between 1729 and 1732. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America but this has been restricted to the coastal areas of South Carolina. The horned lark is now placed together with Temminck&#x27;s lark in the genus &quot;Eremophila&quot; that was introduced in 1828 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie. The specific epithet &quot;alpestris&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of the high mountains&quot;, from &quot;Alpes&quot;, the Alps. A molecular genetic study of the Alaudidae published in 2023 found that Temminck&#x27;s lark (&quot;Eremophila bilopha&quot;) was embedded in a clade containing taxa currently classed as subspecies of the horned lark.
The horned lark is suggested to have diverged from Temminck&#x27;s lark (&quot;E. bilopha&quot;) around the Early-Middle Pleistocene, according to genomic divergence estimates. The horned lark is known from around a dozen localities of Late Pleistocene age, including those in Italy, Russia, The United Kingdom and the United States. The earliest known fossil is from the Calabrian of Spain, around 1–0.8 million years old. In 2020, a 46,000 year old frozen specimen was described from the Russian Far East.

A 2014 genetic analysis suggested that the species consists of six clades that in the future may warrant recognition as separate species. A 2020 study also suggested splitting of the species, but into 4 species instead, the Himalayan horned lark &quot;E. longirostris,&quot; mountain horned lark &quot;E. penicillata,&quot; common horned lark &quot;E. alpestris (sensu stricto),&quot; alongside Temminck&#x27;s lark.

== Description ==
Unlike most other larks, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern. Except for the central feathers, the tail is mostly black, contrasting with the paler body; this contrast is especially noticeable when the bird is in flight. The summer male has black &quot;horns&quot;, which give this species its American name. North America has a number of races distinguished by the face pattern and back colour of males, especially in summer. The southern European mountain race &quot;E. a. penicillata&quot; is greyer above, and the yellow of the face pattern is replaced with white.

Measurements:

* Length: 6.3-7.9 in (16-20 cm)
* Weight: 1.0-1.7 oz (28-48 g)
* Wingspan: 11.8-13.4 in (30-34 cm)

Vocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinkling, and weak. The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The horned lark breeds across much of North America from the high Arctic south to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northernmost Europe and Asia and in the mountains of southeast Europe. There is also an isolated population on a plateau in Colombia. It is mainly resident in the south of its range, but northern populations of this passerine bird are migratory, moving further south in winter.

This is a bird of open ground. In Eurasia it breeds above the tree line in mountains and the far north. In most of Europe, it is most often seen on seashore flats in winter, leading to the European name. In the UK it is found as a winter stopover along the coasts and in eastern England. In North America, where there are no other larks to compete with, it is also found on farmland, on prairies, in deserts, on golf courses and airports.

== Breeding and nesting ==

Males defend territories from other males during breeding season and females will occasionally chase away intruding females. Courting involves the male singing to the female while flying above her in circles. He then will fold his wings in and dive towards the female, opening his wings just before reaching the ground.
The nest site is selected in the early spring by only the female and is either a natural depression in the bare ground or she digs a cavity using her bill and feet. She will spend 2–4 days preparing the site before building her nest. She weaves fine grasses, cornstalks, small roots, and other plant material and lines it with down, fur, feathers, and occasionally lint. The nest is about 3-4 inches in diameter with the interior diameter about 2.5 in wide and 1.5 in deep. It has been noted that she often adds a “doorstep” of pebbles, corncobs, or dung on one side of the nest. It is speculated that this is used to cover the excavated dirt and hide her nest more.

Females will lay a clutch of 2-5 gray eggs with brown spots, each about 1 in long and 0.5 in wide. Incubation will take 10–12 days until hatching and then the nestling period will take 8–10 days. During the nestling period, the chick is fed and defended by both parents. A female in the south can lay 2-3 broods a year while in the north, 1 brood a year is more common.

The structure of horned lark nests can vary depending on the microclimate, prevailing weather and predation risk, revealing flexibility in nesting behaviour to adjust to changing environmental conditions to maintain nest survival and nestling size development.

== Status and conservation ==
Horned lark populations are declining according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. In 2016, the Partners in Flight Landbird Conservation Plan detailed the horned lark as a “Common Bird in Steep Decline,” but the horned lark as of 2016 is not on the State of North America&#x27;s Birds’ Watch List. This species’ decline could be contributed to the loss of habitat due to agricultural pesticides, the disturbed sites the birds prefer reverting to forested lands through reforestation efforts, urbanization and human encroachment as well as collisions at wind farms and at airports. In 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the subspecies streaked horned lark as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

<text>Obie Trice III (born November 14, 1977) is an American rapper. He signed with fellow Detroit rapper Eminem&#x27;s Shady Records, an imprint of Interscope Records in 2000 to release his first two albums, &quot;Cheers&quot; (2003) and &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot; (2006). Both peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the former was supported by the singles &quot;Got Some Teeth&quot; and the Dr. Dre-produced &quot;The Set Up (You Don’t Know)&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg). Upon leaving the label, Trice formed his own record label, Black Market Entertainment to release his following albums, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (2012), &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Fifth&quot; (2019).

== Biography ==
Obie Trice III was born and raised on the west side of Detroit, Michigan, by his mother, along with three brothers. He is of African American and German descent. Trice was given a karaoke machine by his mother when he was 11 and he used it to rhyme over instrumentals from artists such as N.W.A. By the age of 14, he was attending rap battle gatherings around Detroit, including the Hip Hop Shop, where he and his friends would go on Saturday afternoons. The battles were hosted by Proof from D12. Positive response from watchers encouraged Trice to get into rap music seriously.&quot;

Trice was calling himself &quot;Obie 1&quot; at that time, but before Proof introduced him at the Hip Hop Shop, he asked him his real name and introduced him as &quot;Obie Trice&quot;, which remains his rap name. Trice was introduced to Eminem through D12 member Bizarre. Later, Trice&#x27;s manager arranged for him to have dinner and go to a Kid Rock party with Eminem.

== Career ==

=== Shady Records (2000–2002) ===
Trice signed to Shady Records in 2000. He created a freestyle skit on the D12 album &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, following up with an intro snippet in Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; lead single &quot;Without Me&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Drips&quot;. Later in 2002, Trice rapped on songs for the &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack, and also had a cameo appearance in the film as a rapper in a parking lot.

=== &quot;Cheers&quot; (2003–2004) ===

Trice&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Cheers&quot;, was released on September 23, 2003, with its first single &quot;Got Some Teeth&quot; being well received on radio in a number of countries. &quot;Got Some Teeth” peaked at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, &quot;Got Some Teeth&quot; debuted and peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart in October 2003. He also released the singles &quot;The Set Up&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Down&quot;. The album consists of 17 tracks with production from Eminem, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Mike Elizondo, Emile, Fredwreck and Mr. Porter. Artists featured on &quot;Cheers&quot; include Busta Rhymes, Eminem, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, D12, Tony Yayo, and Timbaland. The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.
Trice also featured on the track &quot;Hennessey&quot; on Tupac Shakur&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Loyal To The Game&quot;.

=== &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot; and shooting (2005–2007) ===

In 2005, Trice began work on his second album, entitled &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot;. The album was released on August 15, 2006. Following the release of &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot;, he released a mixtape called &quot;Bar Shots&quot; with G-Unit&#x27;s DJ Whoo Kid.

Shortly after his label-mate Proof was shot to death in a Detroit nightclub, a song emerged on the mixtape circuit called &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;. The song was dedicated to Proof. Trice made a speech at Proof&#x27;s funeral, addressing the problem of black-on-black violence:

In the single &quot;Cry Now&quot; from his second album, Trice addresses his shooting, as well as Eminem&#x27;s rumored retirement, referenced with the following line, &quot;Rock City is my voice / The white boy has stepped down / So I will accept the crown.&quot; Trice also addresses the shooting in the song &quot;Pistol Pistol&quot; from the album &quot;Eminem Presents: The Re-Up&quot; claiming he&#x27;s after revenge, &quot;I solemnly swear on my daughters tears/The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends / Hope you inconspicuous my friend / `Cause once the word get back ya in a world of sin / Bullets will hurtle at him for tryin to murder what been determined as the first solo African &quot; and later &quot;I&#x27;m so sincere you seein&#x27; a hearse this year / it&#x27;s not a verse it&#x27;s curse for burstin&#x27; what&#x27;s on ya person&quot;. He has since given insight as to why he feels the shooting occurred, and has labeled it &quot;haterism&quot;, as well as a bad mind state by saying, &quot;it&#x27;s a lot of do-or-die type individuals. They want to get that plug and there&#x27;s really more to the game than they think it is [...] it&#x27;s competition on a real vicious level.&quot;

=== Departure from Shady Records (2008–2009) ===
In June 2008, Obie Trice departed from Shady Records due to concern that he was not being promoted properly. Contrary to public belief at the time of the announcement, Trice did not have a falling out with Eminem or Dr. Dre. Both contributed vocals and production to Trice&#x27;s upcoming album. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled &quot;The Giant&quot;; however, this was quickly dismissed.

=== &quot;Special Reserve&quot; (2009–2010) ===
On December 15, 2009, a compilation album, &quot;Special Reserve&quot;, by Obie Trice and MoSS, the first producer of DJ Premier&#x27;s &quot;Works of Mart&quot; production company, was released. The album is a collection of eleven of Trice&#x27;s tracks recorded with MoSS from 1997 to 2000. The album served as a preface to his next album, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;.

=== Move to Black Market Entertainment, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;, &quot;The Hangover&quot; and &quot;The Fifth&quot; (2010–present) ===
In 2010, &quot;Rap Basement&quot; reported that Obie Trice would launch his own independent music label, Black Market Entertainment. The label would be owned by Universal. On May 4, he confirmed that Eminem would be a featured guest artist on his upcoming album, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;. On August 24, 2010, he released the single &quot;My Time 2011&quot; via Myspace; the track was produced by Geno XO. The music video was released on March 22, 2011; footage for the video was filmed at the Black Market Ent. Launch Party.

In April 2011, Trice released another single called &quot;Learn to Love&quot;. It was a remixed version of the song &quot;Haters&quot; from his &quot;Bar Shots&quot; mixtape. That August, Trice tweeted the release date for &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;, initially planned for October 25. The first official single, &quot;Battle Cry&quot; featuring Adrian Rezza and produced by Lucas Rezza was released on iTunes on August 23.

On April 3, 2012, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; was released. On May 7, Trice released a new song from his upcoming mixtape &quot;The Hangover&quot; titled &quot;Get Rich Die Tryin&quot; featuring Bilal. In an interview with HipHopDX that August, Trice announced that he was working on an album that would also be also titled &quot;The Hangover&quot;&quot;,&quot; which features production by Warren G. On June 15, 2015, Trice released the single &quot;Good Girls&quot; which would appear on &quot;The Hangover.&quot; The track was produced by the Grammy award-winning producer Magnedo7, who was one of the producers of Eminem&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Recovery&quot;. The album was released on August 7.

In a 2016 interview with Mr. Wavvy, Trice announced that he was already working on his fifth studio album, which he planned to releasing later in the year. Additionally, he revealed plans of a box set that included all four of his previous studio albums, along with previously unreleased tour footage. On August 23, 2019, his fifth album aptly named &quot;The Fifth&quot; was released. It includes guest appearances from Magnedo7, Directorkasper, Xzibit, and others.

On December 10, 2019, Obie Trice released a diss track called &quot;Spanky Hayes&quot; against Nick Cannon after Cannon released two diss tracks against Eminem. In the track, Trice was rapping over the instrumental of &quot;30 Something&quot; by Jay-Z. On December 16, Trice released a second diss track against Cannon called &quot;Spanky Hayes 2&quot; and under original production by Dubmuzik, who has produced for Trice in the past. In the diss track, he also calls out Suge Knight for calling Cannon &quot;the new 2Pac&quot; on the latter&#x27;s first diss track against Eminem.

== Personal life ==
Trice&#x27;s first child, a daughter, was born in 1998. He has credited her birth as motivation for him to get serious with music.

=== Shootings ===
On December 31, 2005, Trice&#x27;s car was shot six times and while driving on the Lodge Expressway by Wyoming Avenue in Detroit; one of the bullets penetrated his head. Trice was able to drive off the expressway, where his girlfriend waved down the police. He was taken to Providence Hospital and released later that day. Doctors contemplated whether or not to remove the bullet. As it was too dangerous to operate, the bullet is still lodged in his skull.

TMZ reported on December 6, 2019, that Trice was arrested for shooting his girlfriend&#x27;s son. On July 8, 2020, Trice was sentenced to 90 days in the Oakland County Jail in Michigan from charges related to the shooting.

=== Meeting with Michigan State Senator ===
On April 22, 2011, Trice met with Michigan State Senator Virgil Smith Jr. to discuss providing local artists with entertainment venues.

=== Michigan arrest ===
On June 16, 2022, Trice was arrested and jailed after an arraignment in District Court in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on a charge of using a telephone to harass or threaten someone. Soon after, he posted the $10,000 bond in the case.

<text>A Fabergé egg () is a jewelled egg first created by the jewellery firm House of Fabergé, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As many as 69 Czarist Russia Era eggs were created, of which 61 are currently known to have survived. Virtually all of the original first edition eggs were manufactured under the supervision of Peter Carl Fabergé between 1885 and 1917. The most famous of the firm&#x27;s creations are the 50 delivered Imperial Easter eggs, of which 44 are currently known to be in complete or partial physical existence, leaving the fate of those remaining unknown. 

These eggs were commissioned for the Russian tsar Aleksandr III (10 eggs) and tsar Nikolai II (40 eggs) as Easter gifts for Alexander&#x27;s wife and Nicholas&#x27;s mother Empress Maria Feodorovna, and Nicholas&#x27;s wife Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna. Fabergé eggs are worth large sums of money and have become symbols of opulence.

Two more of Fabergé Easter Imperial eggs (bringing the total to 52) were designed but were unable to be delivered. One egg known as the Karelian Birch Egg, has confirmed sketches but is not confirmed to have actually been made, and the other, the Blue Tsesarevich Constellation Egg, only partially completed due to the Russian Revolution of 1917.

More recently, Theo Fabergé, grandson of Peter Carl Fabergé, has created a series of eggs as part of the St. Petersburg Collection.

==History==
The House of Fabergé was founded by Gustav Fabergé in 1842 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Fabergé egg was a later addition to the product line by his son, Peter Carl Fabergé.

Prior to 1885, Emperor Alexander III gave his wife Empress Maria Feodorovna jeweled Easter eggs. For Easter in 1883, before his coronation, Alexander III and Maria Feodorovna were given eggs, one of which contained a silver dagger and two skulls. The egg came with messages including &quot;Christ is risen&quot; and &quot;You may crush us—but we Nihilists shall rise again!&quot;

Before Easter 1885, Alexander III&#x27;s brother Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich suggested that Peter Carl Fabergé create a jeweled egg. This type of egg is believed to have been inspired by an ivory hen egg made for the Danish Royal Collection in the 18th century. Known as the Hen Egg, it has a 2.5-inch outer enamel shell and a golden band around the middle. The egg opens to reveal a golden &quot;yolk&quot; within, which opened to reveal a golden hen sitting on golden straw. Inside the hen lay a miniature diamond replica of the Imperial crown and a ruby pendant, though these two elements have been lost. It was given to the tsarina on 1 May 1885. The egg cost 4,151 rubles. Six weeks later, the emperor made Fabergé the supplier to the Imperial Court.

Maria was so delighted by the gift that Alexander appointed Fabergé a &quot;goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown&quot; and commissioned another egg the next year. After that, Peter Carl Fabergé was apparently given complete freedom to design future imperial Easter eggs, and their designs became more elaborate. According to Fabergé family lore, not even the emperor knew what form they would take—the only requirements were that each contain a surprise, and that each be unique. Once Fabergé had approved an initial design, the work was carried out by a team of craftsmen, among them Michael Perkhin, Henrik Wigström, and Erik August Kollin.

After Alexander III&#x27;s death on 1 November 1894, his son, Nicholas II, presented a Fabergé egg to both his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Records have shown that of the 50 imperial Easter eggs, 20 were given to the former and 30 to the latter. Eggs were made each year except 1904 and 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War.

The imperial eggs enjoyed great fame. Fabergé was commissioned to make similar eggs for a few private clients, including the Duchess of Marlborough, the Rothschild family, and the Yusupovs. Fabergé was also commissioned to make twelve eggs for the industrialist Alexander Kelch, though only seven appear to have been completed. Another notable patron was the oil baron Emanuel Nobel, nephew of Alfred Nobel. In 1913, he commissioned an &#x27;Ice Egg&#x27; from Fabergé.

Following the revolution and the nationalization of the Fabergé workshop in St. Petersburg by the Bolsheviks in 1918, the Fabergé family left Russia. The Fabergé trademark has since been sold several times, and several companies have retailed egg-related merchandise using the Fabergé name. From 1998 to 2009, the Victor Mayer jewelry company produced limited-edition Fabergé eggs authorized under Unilever&#x27;s license. The trademark is now owned by Fabergé Limited, which makes egg-themed jewelry.

In 2023, Fabergé debuted Journey in Jewels on Seven Seas Grandeur, a luxury cruise ship from Regent Seven Seas Cruises. The egg will remain on the cruise ship, making it the first ever Fabergé to live at sea.

==List of eggs==
===List of Fabergé imperial Easter eggs===
Below is a chronology of the 52 eggs made for the imperial family. The dating of the eggs has evolved. An earlier chronology dated the Blue Serpent Clock Egg to 1887 and identified the egg of 1895 as the Twelve Monograms Egg. The discovery of the previously lost Third Imperial Easter Egg confirms the chronology below.

===List of the Kelch eggs===
Faberge was also commissioned to make eggs for Alexander Ferdinandovich Kelch, a Siberian gold mine industrialist, as gifts for his wife Barbara (Varvara) Kelch-Bazanova. Though still &quot;Fabergé eggs&quot; by virtue of having been produced by his workshop, these seven eggs were not as elaborate as the imperial eggs, and were not unique in design. Most are copies of other eggs.
===Other Fabergé eggs===
==Location of eggs==
Of the 52 known Fabergé eggs, 46 have survived to the present day. Ten of the imperial Easter eggs are displayed at Moscow&#x27;s Kremlin Armory Museum. Of the 50 delivered imperial eggs, 44 have survived, and there are photographs of three of the six lost eggs: the 1903 Royal Danish Egg, the 1909 Alexander III Commemorative Egg, and the Nécessaire Egg of 1889. The previously lost Third Imperial Easter Egg of 1887 has since been found in the US and bought by Wartski for a private collector. All six of the missing Imperial Eggs belonged to Maria Feodorovna.

After the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks nationalized the House of Fabergé, and the Fabergé family fled to Switzerland, where Peter Carl Fabergé died in 1920. The imperial family&#x27;s palaces were ransacked and their treasures moved to the Kremlin Armoury on order of Vladimir Lenin.

In a bid to acquire more foreign currency, Joseph Stalin had many of the eggs sold in 1927, after their value had been appraised by Agathon Carl Theodor Fabergé. Between 1930 and 1933, 14 imperial eggs left Russia. Many of the eggs were sold to Armand Hammer (president of Occidental Petroleum and a personal friend of Lenin, whose father was founder of the United States Communist Party) and to Emanuel Snowman of the London antique dealers Wartski.

After the collection in the Kremlin Armoury, the largest gathering of Fabergé eggs was assembled by Malcolm Forbes, and displayed in New York City. Totaling nine eggs, and approximately 180 other Fabergé objects, the collection was to be put up for auction at Sotheby&#x27;s in February 2004 by Forbes&#x27; heirs. However, before the auction began, the collection was purchased in its entirety by the oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. In a 2013 BBC Four documentary, Vekselberg revealed he had spent just over $100 million purchasing the nine Fabergé eggs. He claims never to have displayed them in his home, saying he bought them as they are important to Russian history and culture, and he believed them to be the best jewelry art in the world. In the same BBC documentary, Vekselberg revealed he plans to open a museum that will display the eggs in his collection, which was built as a private Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 19 November 2013.

In November 2007, a Fabergé clock, named by Christie&#x27;s auction house as the Rothschild Egg, sold at auction for £8.9 million ($16.5 million) (including commission). The price achieved by the egg set three auction records: it is the most expensive timepiece, Russian object, and Fabergé object ever sold at auction, surpassing the $9.6 million sale of the 1913 Winter Egg in 2002.

In 1989, as part of the San Diego Arts Festival, 26 Fabergé eggs were loaned for display at the San Diego Museum of Art, the largest exhibition of Fabergé eggs anywhere since the Russian Revolution. The eggs included eight from the Kremlin, nine from the Forbes collection, three from the New Orleans Museum of Art, two from the Royal Collection one from the Cleveland Museum of Art and three from private collections.

==In popular culture==

Fabergé eggs have acquired a cult status in the art world and popular culture. Featured in exhibitions, films, TV series, documentaries, cartoons, publications, and the news, they continue to intrigue. They have become symbols of the splendor, power and wealth of the Romanov dynasty and the Russian Empire, priceless treasures to hunt, steal, etc.

As such, they have been part of the plot in several films and television series, including &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; (&quot;Strike&quot; episode, 1985), &quot;Love Among Thieves&quot; (1987), &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;An Egg to Die For&quot; (1994), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &#x27;Round Springfield&quot; (1995) (in which jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy talks about his addiction to buying Fabergé eggs), &quot;Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century&quot; (1999), &quot;The Order&quot; (2001), &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; episode &quot;M.I.A.&quot; (2001), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004), The Simpsons episode &quot;The Last of the Red Hat Mamas&quot; (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants episode &quot;What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?&quot; (2008), &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; (2009), multiple episodes of &quot;White Collar (TV series)&quot; (2009 - 2014), a 2010 episode of the TV series &quot;Leverage&quot; (&quot;The Zanzibar Marketplace Job&quot;), the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;A Jones for a Smith&quot; (2010), &quot;The Intouchables&quot; (2011), &quot;Hustle&quot; episode &quot;Eat Yourself Slender&quot; (2012), many episodes of &quot;Riverdale&quot; belonging to Veronica Lodge, &quot;Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; episode &quot;The House of the Nightmare Witch&quot; (2012), &quot;Person of Interest&quot; episode &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; (2015), &quot;Imperial Eight&quot; (2015), the British crime drama series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (&quot;Lilies of the Valley&quot; egg, season 3, episode 6, 2016) and s3e5, &quot;Hooten &amp; the Lady&quot; episode &quot;Moscow&quot; (2016), &quot;Game Night&quot; (2018), &quot;Between Two Ferns: The Movie&quot; (2019), &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot; (2020), &quot;Lupin&quot; (2021), &quot;Bhamakalapam&quot; (2022). and &quot;The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2023)

In Danielle Steele&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Zoya&quot;, a Fabergé egg is a keepsake of the last two remaining members of a noble family. The 2011 digital card game &quot;&quot; features Fabergé egg as a collectible card. In 2017, visual artist Jonathan Monaghan exhibited a series of digital prints re-interpreting Fabergé eggs in humorous and surreal ways at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.

In M. J. Rose&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;The Last Tiara&quot;, the main character discovers a Fabergé tiara in her late mother&#x27;s apartment. This discovery sets her off on a journey to discover how the tiara came into her mother&#x27;s possession and if her father, a Fabergé workman, was involved.

<doc id="327476" wikidata="Q2500527" url="?curid=327476" title="Ureterosigmoidostomy">
<text>A ureterosigmoidostomy is a surgical procedure wherein the ureters, which carry urine from the kidneys, are diverted into the sigmoid colon. It is performed as a secondary treatment in bladder cancer patients who have undergone cystectomy. Rarely, the cancer can present in children between the ages of 2 &amp; 10 years old as an aggressive rhabdomyosarcoma, although there have been diagnoses of children as young as 3 months old. The procedure was also used several decades ago as a correctional procedure for patients born with bladder exstrophy. In the case of some bladder exstrophy patients, occasional bowel incontinence (in this case, a mixture of urine and feces similar to diarrhea) at night is one uncontrollable consequence.

Another consequence of this procedure is an increased risk of kidney infections (nephritis) due to bacteria from faeces travelling back up the ureters (reflux). Patients are commonly put on oral prophylactic antibiotics to combat infections in the ureteral tract and kidneys, but this can lead to tolerance of the antibiotic. Consequently, the patient can build up tolerance to a large number of oral antibiotics, leading to the need for inpatient administration of IV (intravenous) antibiotics.

Additionally, the urine entering the colon can cause diarrhea and salt imbalance due to the sodium and chloride in the urine. Urea levels in the blood are higher due to urea crossing the colon wall. In the large intestine, sodium is swapped for potassium, and chloride for bicarbonate. This causes hypokalaemia and acidosis. Many patients take sodium bicarbonate to combat this.

Patients with ureterosigmoidostomy have a 100 times greater chance of developing carcinoma of the colon after living with the modification for a number of years (an average of 20–30 years after the operation), 24% of patients go on to develop carcinoma of the bowel.

This operation is no longer popular in many countries, with an ileal conduit (where the ureters lead into a loop of small intestine) being preferred. However, ureterosigmoidostomy is still popular in developing countries, as the maintenance of an ileal conduit or catheter is seen to be more difficult.

<text>Angel Airlines was a private airline with its base at Băneasa Airport (the capital&#x27;s second airport), Bucharest, Romania. It operated domestically, to main cities in Romania.

==History==
Angel Airlines was founded in August 2001, first flying from Bucharest to Baia Mare and Iași. It was founded as a result of Romania&#x27;s rapid economic development, and the growing domestic and short-haul international airline market. The major goal of Angel Airlines was to connect other cities in Romania and the region with Bucharest, the country&#x27;s business center, and a major economic center in the Eastern and Central Europe region.

The company declared bankruptcy and closed in 2004.

==Services==
Angel Airlines used to fly to the following destinations from Bucharest:

*Arad
*Baia Mare
*Constanța
*Iași
*Oradea
*Satu Mare
*Sibiu
*Suceava
*Târgu Mureș

Some flights were under codeshare agreements with TAROM, the national carrier. According to Angel&#x27;s business practise, Angel had two flights on each route, one in the morning and one in the evening, for maximum efficiency.

In August 2002, the airline adopted a new business strategy that was still focused on efficient timing and routes, but also on international and charter flights. The airline was in agreement with a number of Romanian tour operators to provide charter flights to destinations in Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. The airline also introduced the following international and domestic flights:

*Constanța–Istanbul (two flights per week)
*Bucharest–Tirana (two flights per week)

Angel Airlines was also planning to introduce flights on the route Bucharest–Tirana–Bari and Bucharest–Craiova–Rimini.

==Fleet==
The Angel Airlines fleet consisted of two BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft.

<doc id="327487" wikidata="Q112730899" url="?curid=327487" title="Service economy">
<text>Service economy can refer to one or both of two recent economic developments:
* The increased importance of the service sector in industrialized economies. The current list of Fortune 500 companies contains more service companies and fewer manufacturers than in previous decades.
* The relative importance of service in a product offering. The service economy in developing countries is mostly concentrated in financial services, hospitality, retail, health, human services, information technology and education. Products today have a higher service component than in previous decades. In the management literature this is referred to as the servitization of products or a product-service system. Virtually every product today has a service component to it.

The old dichotomy between product and service has been replaced by a Service (economics) service–product continuum . Many products are being transformed into services.

For example, IBM treats its business as a service business. Although it still manufactures computers, it sees the physical goods as a small part of the &quot;business solutions&quot; industry. They have found that the price elasticity of demand for &quot;business solutions&quot; is much less than for hardware. There has been a corresponding shift to a subscription pricing model. Rather than receiving a single payment for a piece of manufactured equipment, many manufacturers are now receiving a steady stream of revenue for ongoing contracts.

Full cost accounting and most accounting reform and monetary reform measures are usually thought to be impossible to achieve without a good model of the service economy.

Since the 1950s, the global economy has undergone a structural transformation. For this change, the American economist Victor R. Fuchs called it “the service economy” in 1968. He believes that the United States has taken the lead in entering the service economy and society in the Western countries. The declaration heralded the arrival of a service economy that began in the United States on a global scale. With the rapid development of information technology, the service economy has also shown new development trends.

==Environmental effects of the service economy==
This is seen, especially in green economics and more specific theories within it such as Natural Capitalism, as having these benefits:
*Much easier integration with accounting for nature&#x27;s services
*Much easier integration with state services under globalization, e.g. meat inspection is a service that is assumed within a product price, but which can vary quite drastically with jurisdiction, with some serious effects.
*Association of goods movements in raw materials and energy markets with the related negative environmental effects (representing emissions or other pollution, biodiversity loss, biosecurity risk) public bads so that no commodity can be traded without assuming responsibility for damage done by its extraction, processing, shipping, trading and sale - its comprehensive outcome
*Easier integration with urban ecology and industrial ecology modelling
*Making it easier to relate to the Experience Economy of actual quality of life decisions made by human beings based on assumptions about service, and integrating economics better with marketing theory about brand value e.g. products are purchased for their assumed reliability in some known process. This assumes that the user&#x27;s experience with the brand (implying a service they expect) is far more important than its technical characteristics

Product stewardship or product take-back are words for a specific requirement or measure in which the service of waste disposal is included in the distribution chain of an industrial product and is paid for at time of purchase. That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you to dispose of it.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process. It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) &quot;commodity&quot; and &quot;product&quot; relationships.

It is often applied to paint, tires, and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly. It is most familiar as the container deposit charged for a deposit bottle. One pays a fee to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains. If one returns the bottle, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling. If not, one has paid the fee, and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of diapers or a broken bottle. Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of gaining a small income. This is quite common for instance among homeless people in U.S. cities. Legal requirements vary: the bottle itself may be considered the property of the purchaser of the contents, or, the purchaser may have some obligation to return the bottle to some depot so it can be recycled or re-used.

In some countries, such as Germany, law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way. This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally. In the United States, there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability - holding companies responsible for things the product does which it was never advertised to do.

Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits, many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting. This is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved, not just those investing or purchasing. Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive, as it avoids liability and future lawsuits.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency advocates product stewardship to &quot;reduce the life-cycle environmental effects of products.&quot; The ideal of product stewardship, as administered by the EPA in 2004, &quot;taps the shared ingenuity and responsibility of businesses, consumers, governments, and others,&quot; the EPA states at a Web site.

==Role of the service economy in development==
Services constitute over 50% of GDP in low income countries and as their economies continue to develop, the importance of services in the economy continues to grow. The service economy is also key to growth, for instance it accounted for 47% of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the period 2000–2005 (industry contributed 37% and agriculture 16% in the same period). This means that recent economic growth in Africa relies as much on services as on natural resources or textiles, despite many of those countries benefiting from trade preferences in primary and secondary goods. As a result, employment is also adjusting to the changes and people are leaving the agricultural sector to find work in the service economy. This job creation is particularly useful as often it provides employment for low skilled labour in the tourism and retail sectors, thus benefiting the poor in particular and representing an overall net increase in employment. The service economy in developing countries is most often made up of the following:
* Financial services
* Tourism
* Distribution
* Health, and
* Education
The export potential of many of these products is already well understood, e.g. in tourism, financial services and transport, however, new opportunities are arising in other sectors, such as the health sector. For example:
* Indian companies who provide scanning services for US hospitals
* South Africa is developing a market for surgery and tourism packages
* India, the Philippines, South Africa and Mauritius have experienced rapid growth in IT services, such as call centers, back-office functions and software development.

==Servitization drivers==
The trend of servitization is very visible while looking at the growth of the service shares in the United States and European countries GDP than 20 years ago. Services are becoming an inseparable component of the product, as the supplier offers them jointly with the core to improve its performance (IBM, 2010). However, what are the key drivers for reshaping the business model of the company? Baines, Lightfoot, &amp; Kay (2006) name three main sets of factors that motivate companies to expand into services sectors: financial, strategic and marketing.

===Financial drivers===
The financial driver is reflected in improved profit margins and stable income, that come with servitization. In the increasing price competition among product offering, companies can use services to recover the lost potential revenue. GE&#x27;s transportation division encountered a 60% drop in the number of locomotives sold between 1999 and 2002 but did not turn out disastrously because the revenue from services has tripled from $500M to $1.5B from 1996 to 2002. According to an AMR Research (1999) report, companies earn over 45% gross profits from the aftermarket services although they represent only 24% of revenues. It also shows that GM earned more profits in 2001 from $9 billion after-sale revenues than it did from $150 billion income from car sales.

Also, the servitization levels the seasonality of the product and increases life cycles of the complex products, examples of which one can see in the aircraft industry, whereby companies stop focusing on the pure product delivery but start introducing maintenance and other aftermarket activities.

===Strategic drivers===
Strategic drivers focus mainly on gaining and securing the competitive advantage by the company. For the company to be able to achieve sustainable competitive advantage, its resources should be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate and organised. Servitization might not be the ultimate and only guarantee for the company of achieving it. However, it shows to be valuable as it is not provided by many suppliers, and it facilitates the usage of the product by the customer. It is also rare and difficult to imitate as not too many companies have capabilities of providing service to the customer since the producer has better knowledge and experience in the product functioning. Moreover, services are less visible and require more labour, therefore, prove to be more difficult to imitate. Finally, commoditisation is pushing the prices down, forcing companies to constantly innovate. However, adding services to the product enhances its value to the customer making it more valuable and perceived customised as service delivery can be done in a more individual way answering the customer needs on a more ad hoc manner.

===Marketing and sales drivers===
As services are provided on a long-term basis rather than one-time sale they offer more time to build the relationship with the customers and allow supplier to create the brand. Moreover, it enables the sales team to influence the purchasing decisions, by giving them opportunities to upsell additional product extension or other complementing parts of the product. Growing needs for services in the B2B industry comes from the customer and his need for not universal but custom-made solutions and this requires understanding his scope of work. This kind of work requires time and meetings of both sides during which trust and understanding are developed, which further leads to loyalty. Last but not least working closely with customer and having opinions from a different perspective provides the supplier with valuable insights about the industry enabling him to innovate with a more customer-centric approach.

Designing a proper go-to-market strategy (aligned with an operations strategy) is key success factor for the PSS to be successfully introduced on the market. The 5Cs marketing framework analysis shall be applied: 
* Context (PESTEL analysis) 
* Customer
* Competition
* Collaborators (suppliers and distributors)
* Company (Internal capabilities, for instance with a VRIN test)

Perticularly important is the pricing approach, that to be successful shall adopt a Total Economic Value approach supported by a conjoint analysis to determine customer preferences and price sensitivity. Servitization contracts are typically based on fixed-fee schemas with increasing level of risks:
* fixed-fee for Product oriented PSS have the lowest level of risks
* level of risks increase moving versus usage-based oriented PSS, as an agreed uptime level is the base of pricing
* highest risks is captured with fixed fee for result-based PSS.
TEV analysis shall identify how the repositioning of such risks from customers to supplier creates value for the client and shall be used in pricing strategy

<text>The Colpodea are a class of ciliates, of about 200 species common in freshwater and soil habitats. The body cilia are typically uniform, and are supported by dikinetids of characteristic structure, with cilia on both kinetosomes. The mouth may be apical or ventral, with more or less prominent associated polykinetids. Many are asymmetrical, the cells twisting sideways and then untwisting again prior to division, which often takes place within cysts. &quot;Colpoda&quot;, a kidney-shaped ciliate common in organic rich conditions, is representative.

Most ciliates placed here were originally considered advanced trichostomes, on the assumption that they lacked true oral cilia. However the Bursariomorphida, large carnivorous ciliates whose oral cavity forms a deep anterior pocket, were considered heterotrichs because of their prominent oral polykinetids. The modern class was first defined by Small &amp; Lynn in 1981, based mainly on the structure of the body kinetids.

<text>Pale lager is a pale-to-golden lager beer with a well-attenuated body and a varying degree of noble hop bitterness.

In the mid-19th century, Gabriel Sedlmayr took British pale ale brewing and malt making techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied them to existing lagering methods. The resulting beers gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.

== History ==
Bavarian brewers in the sixteenth century were required by law to brew beer only during the cooler months of the year. In order to have beer available during the hot summer months, beers would be stored (lagered) in caves and stone cellars, often under blocks of ice.

In the period 1820–1830, a brewer named Gabriel Sedlmayr II the Younger, whose family was running the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, went around Europe to improve his brewing skills. When he returned, he used what he had learned to get a more stable and consistent lager beer. The Bavarian lager was still different from the widely known modern lager; due to the use of dark malts it was quite dark, representing what is now called Dunkel beer or the stronger variety, bock beer. This technique was applied by Josef Groll in the city of Pilsen, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, (now Czech Republic) using less-roasted grains, resulting in the first pale lager Pilsner Urquell in 1842.

The new recipe of the improved lager beer spread quickly over Europe. In particular Sedlmayr&#x27;s friend Anton Dreher adopted new kilning techniques that enabled the use of lighter malts to improve the Viennese beer in 1840–1841, creating a rich amber-red colored Vienna-style lager.

== Description ==
Pale lagers tend to be dry, lean, clean-tasting and crisp. Flavors may be subtle, with no traditional beer ingredient dominating the others. Hop character (bitterness, flavor, and aroma) ranges from negligible to a dry bitterness from noble hops. The main ingredients are water, Pilsner malt and noble hops, though some brewers use adjuncts such as rice or corn to lighten the body of the beer.

Depending on style, pale lagers typically contain 4-6% alcohol by volume.

== Variations ==

=== Pilsner ===

Pale lager was developed in the mid 19th-century, when Gabriel Sedlmayr took some British pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany, and started to modernize continental brewing methods. In 1842, a new modern lager brewery Měšťanský pivovar was built in Plzeň (), a city in western Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic. The first known example of a golden lager, &quot;Pilsner Urquell&quot;, was brewed there by Josef Groll. This beer proved so successful that other breweries followed the trend, using the name Pilsner. Breweries now use the terms &quot;lager&quot; and &quot;Pilsner&quot; interchangeably, though pale lagers from the Czech Republic and Germany categorized as pilsner tend to have more evident noble hop aroma and dry finish than other pale lagers.

=== Dortmunder Export ===

With the success of Pilsen&#x27;s golden beer, the town of Dortmund in Germany started brewing pale lager in 1873. As Dortmund was a major brewing center, and the town breweries grouped together to export the beer beyond the town, the brand name
&quot;Dortmunder Export&quot; became known. Today, breweries in Denmark, the Netherlands, and North America also brew pale lagers labelled as Dortmunder Export.

=== Helles ===

&quot; or &quot; is a traditional German pale lager, produced chiefly in Southern Germany, particularly Munich. The German word can be translated as &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, or &quot;pale&quot;. In 1894, the Spaten Brewery in Munich noticed the commercial success of the pale lagers Pilsner and Dortmunder Export; Spaten utilized the methods that Sedlmayr had brought home over 50 years earlier to produce their own pale lager they named in order to distinguish it from the darker, sweeter or (&quot;dark beers&quot;) from that region. Initially other Munich breweries were reluctant to brew pale-coloured beer, though, as the popularity of pale beers grew, so other breweries in Munich and Bavaria gradually began brewing pale lager either using the name or .

Pale lagers termed , , or gold remain popular in Munich and Bavaria, with a local inclination to use low levels of hops, and an abv in the range 4.7% to 5.4%; Munich breweries which produce such pale lagers include Löwenbräu, , Augustiner Bräu, Paulaner, and Hacker-Pschorr, with Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu producing a 5.2% abv pale lager called .

=== American lager ===

The earliest known brewing of pale lager in the United States was in the Old City section of Philadelphia in 1840, by John Wagner, using yeast from his native Bavaria. Modern American lagers are still widely made, in a market dominated by large breweries such as Anheuser-Busch and Molson-Coors (formerly MillerCoors). Lightness of body is the norm, both by design and since it allows the use of a high percentage of less expensive, light-bodied rice or corn. Some American lagers are brewed as calorie-reduced light beers.

=== Australian lager ===

Beer from XXXX, various Tooheys&#x27; brands, Victoria Bitter (which is classified as a lager), West End, Swan, and Foster&#x27;s Lager, are Australian lagers. An Australian lager with an amber hue and slightly bitter flavour typically brewed with Pride of Ringwood hops or its descendants.

=== Dry beer ===
The term &quot;dry beer&quot; has varied with time and region - and still does.

Though the term was not yet used, the first dry beer, &quot;Gablinger&#x27;s Diet Beer&quot;, was released in 1967, developed by Joseph Owades at Rheingold Breweries in Brooklyn. Owades developed an enzyme that could further break down starches, so that the finished product contained fewer residual carbohydrates and was lower in food energy.

A marketing term for a fully attenuated pale lager, originally used in Japan by Asahi Breweries in 1987, , was taken up by the American brewer Anheuser-Busch in 1988 as &quot;dry beer&quot; for the Michelob brand, &quot;Michelob Dry&quot;. This was followed by other &quot;dry beer&quot; brands such as Bud Dry, though the marketing concept was not considered a success. In Australia, the term &quot;Dry&quot; is used for beers that are lower in carbohydrates.

While all lagers are well attenuated, a more fully fermented (i.e. &quot;dry&quot;) pale lager in Germany goes by the name &quot;Diät-Pils&quot; or &quot;&quot;. &quot;Diet&quot; in the instance not referring to being &quot;light&quot; in calories or body, rather its sugars are fully fermented into alcohol, allowing the beer to be targeted to diabetics due to its lower carbohydrate content. Because the available sugars are fully fermented, dry beers often have a higher alcohol content, which, if desired, may be reduced in the same manner as low-alcohol beers.

Since the 2012 revisions to the &quot;&quot; (Ordinance on Dietetic Foodstuffs), it is no longer permitted to label beer as &quot;Diät&quot; in Germany, but it may be advertised as &quot;suitable for diabetics&quot;. Prior to this change, a &quot;Diätbier&quot; could contain no more than 7.5 g of unfermented carbohydrates per liter (a typical lager contains 30-40 g/L), and the alcohol content could not exceed normal levels (5% ABV).

== Strong lager ==
Pale lagers that exceed an abv of around 5.8% are variously termed bock, malt liquor/super strength lager, Oktoberfestbier/Märzen, or European strong lager.

=== Bock ===

Bock is a strong lager which has origins in the Hanseatic town of Einbeck in Germany. The name is a corruption of the medieval German brewing town of Einbeck, but also means billy goat (buck) in German. The original bocks were dark beers, brewed from highly roasted malts. Modern bocks can be dark, amber or pale in color. Bock was traditionally brewed for special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent.

=== Malt liquor ===

Malt liquor is an American term referring to a strong pale lager brewed to an unnaturally high alcohol content through the addition of such high-carbohydrate adjuncts as corn, rice, and sugar. In the UK, similarly made beverages are called super-strength lager.

=== Oktoberfestbier/Märzen ===
Oktoberfest is a German festival dating from 1810, and Oktoberfestbiers are the beers that have been served at the festival since 1818, and are supplied by six breweries: Spaten, Löwenbräu, Augustiner-Bräu, Hofbräu-München, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr. Traditionally Oktoberfestbiers were lagers of around 5.5 to 6 abv called &quot;Märzen&quot;, brewed in March and allowed to ferment slowly during the summer months. Originally these would have been dark lagers, but from 1872 a strong March brewed version of an amber-red Vienna lager made by Josef Sedlmayr became the favorite Oktoberfestbier. Despite its origins, the color of Märzen - and thus Oktoberfestbier - has become ever lighter since the late 20th century, with many Oktoberfest beers brewed in Munich since 1990 being golden in color; though some Munich brewers still produce darker versions, mostly for export to the United States.

Oktoberfestbier is a registered trademark of the big six Munich breweries, which call themselves the Club of Munich Brewers. Along with other Munich beer, it is protected by the European Union as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).

<doc id="327498" wikidata="Q348455" url="?curid=327498" title="Gideon Mantell">
<text>Gideon Algernon Mantell MRCS FRS (3 February 1790 – 10 November 1852) was an English obstetrician, geologist and palaeontologist. His attempts to reconstruct the structure and life of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; began the scientific study of dinosaurs: in 1822 he was responsible for the discovery (and the eventual identification) of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton, of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. Mantell&#x27;s work on the Cretaceous of southern England was also important.

== Early life and medical career ==

Mantell was born in Lewes, Sussex as the fifth-born child of Thomas Mantell, a shoemaker, and Sarah Austen. He was raised in a small cottage in St. Mary&#x27;s Lane with his two sisters and four brothers. As a youth, he showed a particular interest in the field of geology. He explored pits and quarries in the surrounding areas, discovering ammonites, shells of sea urchins, fish bones, coral, and worn-out remains of dead animals. The Mantell children could not study at local grammar schools because the elder Mantell was a follower of the Methodist church and the 12 free schools were reserved for children who had been brought up in the Anglican faith. As a result, Gideon was educated at a dame school in St. Mary&#x27;s Lane, and learned basic reading and writing from an old woman. After the death of his teacher, Mantell was schooled by John Button, a philosophically radical Whig who shared similar political beliefs with Mantell&#x27;s father. Mantell spent two years with Button, before being sent to his uncle, a Baptist minister, in Swindon, for a period of private study.

Mantell returned to Lewes at age 15. With the help of a local Whig party leader, Mantell secured an apprenticeship with a local surgeon named James Moore. He served as an apprentice to Moore in Lewes for a period of five years, in which he took care of Mantell&#x27;s dining, lodging and medical issues. Mantell&#x27;s early apprenticeship duties included cleaning vials, as well as separating and arranging drugs. Soon, he learned how to make pills and other pharmaceutical products. He delivered Moore&#x27;s medicines, kept his accounts, wrote out bills and extracted teeth from his patients. On 11 July 1807, Thomas Mantell died at the age of 57. He left his son some money for his future studies. As his time in apprenticeship began to wind down, he began to anticipate his medical education. He began to teach himself human anatomy, and he ultimately detailed his new-found knowledge in a volume entitled &quot;The Anatomy of the Bones, and the Circulation of Blood&quot;, which contained dozens of detailed drawings of fetal and adult skeletal features. Soon, Mantell began his formal medical education in London. He received his diploma as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1811. Four days later, he received a certificate from the Lying-in Charity for Married Women at Their Own Habitations that allowed him to act in midwifery duties.
He returned to Lewes, and immediately formed a partnership with his former master, James Moore. In the wake of the cholera, typhoid and smallpox epidemics, Mantell found himself quite busy attending to more than 50 patients a day and delivering between 200 and 300 babies a year. As he later recalled, he would have to stay up for &quot;six or seven nights in succession&quot; due to his overwhelming doctoral duties. He was also able to increase his practice&#x27;s profits from £250 to £750 a year. Although mainly occupied with running his busy country medical practice, he spent his little free time pursuing his passion, geology, often working into the early hours of the morning, identifying fossil specimens he found at the marl pits in Hamsey. In 1813, Mantell began to correspond with James Sowerby. Sowerby, a naturalist and illustrator who catalogued fossil shells, received from Mantell many fossilised specimens. In appreciation for the specimens Mantell had provided, Sowerby named one of the species &quot;Ammonites mantelli&quot;. On 7 December, Mantell was elected as a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Two years later, he published his first paper, on the characteristics of the fossils found in the Lewes area.

In 1816, he married Mary Ann Woodhouse, the 20-year-old daughter of one of his former patients who had died three years earlier. Since she was not 21 and still technically a minor under English law, she had to obtain permission from her mother and a special licence to marry Mantell. After obtaining consent and the licence, she married Mantell on 4 May at St. Marylebone Church. That year, he purchased his own medical practice and took up an appointment at the Royal Artillery Hospital, at Ringmer, Lewes.

==Geological research==

Inspired by Mary Anning&#x27;s sensational discovery of a fossilised animal resembling a huge crocodile (later identified as an ichthyosaur) at Lyme Regis in Dorset, Mantell became passionately interested in the study of the fossilised animals and plants found in his area. The fossils he had collected from the region, near The Weald in Sussex, were from the chalk downlands covering the county. The chalk is part of the Upper Cretaceous System and the fossils it contains are marine in origin. But by 1819, Mantell had begun acquiring fossils from a quarry, at Whitemans Green, near Cuckfield. These included the remains of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, at a time when all the known fossil remains from Cretaceous England, hitherto, were marine in origin. He named the new strata the &quot;Strata of Tilgate Forest&quot;, after an historical wooded area and it was later shown to belong to the Lower Cretaceous.

By 1820, he had started to find very large bones at Cuckfield, even larger than those discovered by William Buckland, at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire. Then, in 1822, shortly before finishing his first book (&quot;The Fossils of South Downs&quot;), his wife found several large teeth (although some historians contend that they were in fact discovered by himself), the origin of which he could not ascertain. In 1821 Mantell planned his next book on the geology of Sussex. It was an immediate success with two hundred subscribers including King George IV at Carlton House Palace, who wrote a letter stating, &quot;His majesty is pleased to command that his name should be placed at the head of the subscription list for four copies.&quot;
How the king heard of Mantell is unknown, but Mantell&#x27;s response is known. Galvanised and encouraged, Mantell showed the teeth to other scientists but they were dismissed as belonging to a fish or mammal and from a more recent rock layer than the other Tilgate Forest fossils. The eminent French anatomist, Georges Cuvier, identified the teeth as those of a rhinoceros.

Although according to Charles Lyell, Cuvier made this statement after a late party and apparently had some doubts when reconsidering the matter when he awoke, fresh in the morning. &quot;The next morning he told me that he was confident that it was something quite different.&quot; Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the Mesozoic strata and finally recognised that they resembled those of the iguana, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60 feet (18 metres) in length.

== Recognition ==

He tried in vain to convince his peers that the fossils were from Mesozoic strata, by carefully studying rock layers. William Buckland famously disputed Mantell&#x27;s assertion, by claiming that the teeth were of fish.

When it was proved Mantell was correct in 1825, the only question was what to call his new reptile. His original name was &quot;Iguana-saurus&quot; but he then received a letter from William Daniel Conybeare: &quot;Your discovery of the analogy between the Iguana and the fossil teeth is very interesting but the name you propose will hardly do, because it is equally applicable to the recent iguana. Iguanoides or Iguanodon would be better.&quot; Mantell took this advice to heart and called his creature &quot;Iguanodon&quot;.

Years later, Mantell had acquired enough fossil evidence to show that the dinosaur&#x27;s forelimbs were much shorter than its hind legs, therefore proving they were not built like a mammal as claimed by Sir Richard Owen. Mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil vertebrae, which Owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He also named a new genus of dinosaur called &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles.

== Later years ==
In 1833, Mantell relocated to Brighton but his medical practice suffered. He was almost rendered destitute, but for the town&#x27;s council, which promptly transformed his house into a museum. There he gave a series of lectures that were published in 1838 with the title &quot;The wonders of geology, or, A familiar exposition of geological phenomena: being the substance of a course of lectures delivered at Brighton&quot;. The museum in Brighton ultimately failed as a result of Mantell&#x27;s habit of waiving the entrance fee. Financially destitute, Mantell offered to sell the entire collection to the British Museum in 1838 for £5,000, accepting the counter-offer of £4,000. He moved to Clapham Common in South London, where he continued his work as a doctor.

Mary Mantell left her husband in 1839. That same year, Gideon&#x27;s son Walter emigrated to New Zealand. Walter later sent his father some important fossils from New Zealand. Gideon&#x27;s daughter, Hannah, died in 1840.

In 1841 he began to suffer from what would eventually be diagnosed as scoliosis, possibly precipitated by a carriage accident. He got stuck in the reins and was dragged along for 5 miles before arriving at his destination. Despite being bent, crippled and in constant pain, he continued to work with fossilised reptiles and published a number of scientific books and papers until his death in November the 10th 1852. He moved to Pimlico in 1844 and began to take opium, as a painkiller, in 1845.

== Death and legacy==
On 10 November 1852, Mantell took an overdose of opium and later lapsed into a coma. He died that afternoon. His post-mortem by William Adams showed that he had been suffering from severe lumbar scoliosis, leading to the Adams Forward Bend Test as a diagnostic tool. A section of Mantell&#x27;s spine was removed, preserved and stored on a shelf at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It remained there until 1969 when it was destroyed due to lack of space.

Mantell&#x27;s surgery, on the south side of Clapham Common, is now a dental surgery.

At the time of his death Mantell was credited with discovering four of the five genera of dinosaurs then known.

In 2000, in commemoration of Mantell&#x27;s discovery and his contribution to the science of palaeontology, the &quot;Mantell Monument&quot; was unveiled at Whiteman&#x27;s Green, Cuckfield. The monument has been confirmed as the location of the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; fossils that Mantell first described in 1822.

He is buried at West Norwood Cemetery within a sarcophagus attributed to Amon Henry Wilds that replicates the sanctuary of Natakamani&#x27;s Temple of Amun. (The name ammonite is, coincidentally, derived from Amun.)

<text>The hypotrichs are a group of ciliated protozoa, common in fresh water, salt water, soil and moss. Hypotrichs possess compound ciliary organelles called &quot;cirri,&quot; which are made up of thick tufts of cilia, sparsely distributed on the ventral surface of the cell. The multiple fused cilia which form a cirrus function together as a unit, enabling the organism to crawl along solid substrates such as submerged debris or sediments. Hypotrichs typically possess a large oral aperture, bordered on one side by a wreath or collar of membranelles (small membranous structures made up of fused cilia), forming an &quot;adoral zone of membranelles,&quot; or AZM.

== Classification ==

In older systems of classification, the term hypotrich comprised all ciliates possessing a relatively flattened body shape, strong cirri restricted to the ventral surface, and a large oral region (peristome) partially surrounded by an &quot;adoral zone of membranelles&quot;. From a phylogenetic point of view, this historic grouping--which included both euplotid ciliates (such as &quot;Euplotes&quot; and &quot;Aspidisca&quot;), and stichotrichian ciliates (such as &quot;Oxytricha&quot; and &quot;Urostyla&quot;)--is paraphyletic. Any natural group, or clade, that contains both &quot;Euplotes&quot; and &quot;Oxytricha&quot; would also have to include many morphologically dissimilar spirotrich ciliates, such as the tintinnids and the oligotrichs.

In the classification system developed by Denis Lynn in collaboration with Eugene B. Small, the subclass Hypotrichia was restricted to euplotids and one small order of marine ciliates called Kiitrichida, while most of the traditional hypotrichs were placed in the subclass Stichotrichia. However, some prominent researchers—notably, the Austrian ciliatologist Helmut Berger—rejected Lynn&#x27;s nomenclature, and continued to assign non-euplotid &quot;hypotrich&quot; ciliates, such as oxytrichids and urostyloids, to some variant of Friedrich von Stein&#x27;s original order Hypotricha. 

In their revised classification of the phylum Ciliophora, published in 2016, Gao et al. place the &quot;stichotrichs&quot; of Lynn &amp; Small in the synonymous subclass Hypotrichia, and place all euplotid and discocephalid ciliates in the subclass Euplotia. The same high-level taxa are used, without ranks, by Adl et al. in their &quot;Revised Classification of Eukaryotes&quot; of 2012.

<text>The stichotrichs were a proposed group of ciliates, in the class Spirotrichea. In a classification system proposed by Eugene Small and Denis Lynn in 1985, Stichotrichia formed a subclass containing four orders: Stichotrichida, Urostylida, Sporadotrichida and Plagiotomida. Although the group was made up of species traditionally classified among the &quot;hypotrichs&quot;—ciliates possessing compound ciliary organelles called cirri—it excluded euplotid ciliates such as &quot;Euplotes&quot; and &quot;Diophrys&quot;, which were placed in the subclass Hypotrichia. In later classifications proposed by Denis Lynn, Stichotrichia omits the order Plagiotomida (species in that group were relocated to the order Stichotrichida).

In more recent classifications, members of Stichotrichia, as defined by Small and Lynn., are placed in the subclass Hypotrichia, and euplotid ciliates are placed in the subclass Euplotia.

Like the euplotids, stichotrichs (or hypotrichs, in the sense of Gao et al., 2016) have body cilia fused into cirri, but these are mostly arranged into rows, running along the ventral surface or edges of the cell. Most stichotrichs are flattened and reasonably flexible, although some, such as &quot;Stylonychia&quot;, have rigid bodies. Characteristic genera include &quot;Stylonychia&quot;, &quot;Oxytricha&quot;, &quot;Uroleptus&quot; and &quot;Urostyla&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;stichotrich&quot; derives from the ancient greek (), meaning &quot;row&quot;, and , (), meaning &#x27;hair&#x27;, because of the arrangement into rows of the cilia.

== Genomics ==
The draft macronuclear genome of &quot;Oxytricha trifallax&quot; was published in 2013.

<text>The choreotrichs are a group of small marine ciliates. Their name reflects the impression that they appear to dance (&#x27;choreo&#x27; as in choreography). The group includes the tintinnids, which produce species-specific loricae (shells), and are important because these may be preserved as microfossils. The cyst forms have been suggested to be affiliated to Chitinozoans, although other studies suggest Chitinozoans to have affinities to larger marine animals, and not tintinnids.
Often they have been included among the oligotrichs. Tintinnids seem to be an excessively specious group as over 400 living species have been described, based on characteristics of the lorica or shell.

Choreotrichs (including tintinnids) are part of the microzooplankton. Generally small (20–200 micrometres in size) organisms found in the plankton. They feed on small algae and serve as prey for larger organisms in the plankton such as copepods and larval fish.

Alma Guillermoprieto (born Alma Estela Guillermo Prieto, 1949) is a Mexican journalist. She has written extensively about Latin America for the British and American press, especially &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Her writings have also been widely disseminated within the Spanish-speaking world and she has published eight books in both English and Spanish, and been translated into several more languages.

Guillermoprieto began her career as a dancer (later the subject of two of her books: &quot;Samba&quot;, 1990, and &quot;Dancing with Cuba&quot;, 2004), before turning to journalism in 1978 and soon breaking the story of the 1981 El Mozote massacre by the army in El Salvador. In English, she has published two books collecting her long-form journalism on Latin America: &quot;The Heart That Bleeds&quot; (1994) and &quot;Looking for History&quot; (2001). She has also published three books collecting and translating her English reporting into Spanish. She has won a MacArthur Fellowship (1995), a George Polk Award (2001), and a Princess of Asturias Award (2018), among other honors.

==Early life==
Alma Estela Guillermo Prieto was born in 1949 in Mexico City. In her teens, she moved to New York City with her mother. She studied modern dance with Merce Cunningham until 1969 when he recommended her for a job teaching at the Cuban National Schools of the Arts in Havana. She spent six months there. From 1962 to 1973, she was a professional dancer.

== Journalism career ==
In 1978, she started her journalism career as a stringer for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where she covered the Nicaraguan Revolution. In 1981 she moved to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and in January 1982, Guillermoprieto, then based in Mexico City, was one of two journalists (the other was Raymond Bonner of &quot;The New York Times&quot;) who broke the story of the El Mozote massacre in which some 900 villagers at El Mozote, El Salvador, were slaughtered by the Salvadoran army in December, 1981. With great hardship and at great personal risk, she was smuggled in by FMLN rebels to visit the site approximately a month after the massacre took place. When the story broke simultaneously in the &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; on January 27, 1982, it was dismissed as propaganda by the Reagan administration. Subsequently, however, the details of the massacre as first reported by Guillermoprieto and Bonner were verified, with widespread repercussions.

Guillermoprieto was promoted to staff writer at the Post, where she worked for two years before winning an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 1985, funding research and writing about changes in rural life under the policies of the European Economic Community. She next became a Latin American correspondent for &quot;Newsweek,&quot; until 1987 when she left to write a book. Her first book, &quot;Samba&quot; (1990), was an account of a season studying at a samba school in Rio de Janeiro. It was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award. Also in 1990, Guillermoprieto won a Maria Moors Cabot Prize, honoring her contributions to press freedom and inter-American understanding in the Western hemisphere.

During the 1990s, she worked as a freelance writer, contributing long reported articles on Latin American culture and politics for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, including on the Colombian civil war, the Shining Path during the Internal conflict in Peru, the aftermath of the &quot;Dirty War&quot; in Argentina, and post-Sandinista Nicaragua.
Thirteen of these pieces were bundled in the book &quot;The Heart That Bleeds&quot; (1994), now considered a classic portrait of the politics and culture of Latin America during the &quot;lost decade&quot; (it was published in Spanish as &quot;Al pie de un volcán te escribo — Crónicas latinoamericanas&quot; in 1995).

In 1993, she published an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on Pablo Escobar; this article, &quot;Exit El Patron,&quot; was referenced in the Netflix series &quot;Narcos&quot;.

In April 1995, at the request of Gabriel García Márquez, Guillermoprieto taught the inaugural workshop at the Fundación para un Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano, an institute for promoting journalism that was established by García Márquez in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. She has since held more workshops for young journalists throughout the continent.

That same year, Guillermoprieto also received a MacArthur Fellowship.

In 2001, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. That year, she published a second anthology of articles, &quot;Looking for History: Latin America&quot;, collecting pieces on Cuba, Mexico and Colombia written for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In a review for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Kenneth Maxwell wrote, &quot;Guillermoprieto is well recognized for her evocative, intimate style and her sympathetic but critical insights into Latin American affairs. These skills are all on display again here…clearly a writer at the top of her form.&quot; In 2001, she also published a three-part series in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; on the Colombian drug trade. The series won a George Polk Award for foreign reporting. She also published a collection of articles in Spanish on the Mexican crisis, &quot;El año en que no fuimos felices&quot;.

In 2004, Guillermoprieto published a memoir, &quot;Dancing with Cuba&quot;, which revolved around the time she spent living in Cuba in her early twenties. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Katha Pollitt praised the nuance Guillermoprieto brought to the book, as well as &quot;sly humor, curiosity and knowledge.&quot; An excerpt from it was published in 2003 in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In the fall of 2008, Guillermoprieto joined the faculty of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Chicago, as a Tinker Visiting professor.

In 2017, she won the Ortega y Gasset Award for her career in journalism. In 2018, she won the Princesa de Asturias Award in Communication and Humanities, Spain&#x27;s most prestigious award for authors.

<text>Naim bey Frashëri, more commonly Naim Frashëri (; ; 25 May 184620 October 1900), was an Albanian historian, journalist, poet, rilindas and translator who was proclaimed as the national poet of Albania. He is regarded as a pioneer of modern Albanian literature and one of the most influential Albanian cultural icons of the 19th century.

Frashëri&#x27;s works explored themes such as freedom, humanity, unity, tolerance and revolution. His twenty-two works consist of fifteen works written in Albanian as well as four in Turkish, two in Greek and one in Persian. He is considered to be the most representative writer of Sufi poetry in Albanian, and having been under the influence of his uncle Dalip Frashëri, he tried to mingle Sufism with Western philosophy in his poetical ideals. He had an extraordinarily profound impact on Albanian literature and society during the 20th century, most notably on Asdreni, Gjergj Fishta and Lasgush Poradeci, among many others.

&quot;Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar&quot; (&quot;You Albania, you give me honour, you give me the name Albanian&quot;), a memorable line in his poem &quot;O malet e Shqipërisë&quot;, has been designated as the national motto of Albania. It speaks to unity and freedom and it embodies in its words a sense of pride towards the country and people.

== Life ==

=== Family ===

Naim Frashëri was born on 25 May 1846 into a wealthy Albanian family of religious belief affiliated with the Bektashi tariqa of Islam, in the village of Frashër in what was then part of the Ottoman Empire and now Albania. He, Abdyl and Sami were one of eight children of Halid Frashëri (1797–1859), a landowner and military commander and Emine (1814–1861). Halid belonged to the Dakollari branch of the Frashëri family. They were descendants of Ajaz Bey from Gramsh who in 1650–60 was given the command of Frashër. Ajaz Bey&#x27;s grandfather, Hamza Bey had lost his lands in Tomorrica in 1570 when he rebelled and was exiled but the family&#x27;s fortunes changed with the rise of Köprülü Mehmed Pasha who intervened on their behalf and they were pardoned. Emine came from the family of Iljaz Bej Mirahori from the region around Korçë that traced its ancestry back to the 15th century.

Naim and his brothers Abdyl and Sami were born and raised in the village of Frashër at the southern slopes of the Tomorr Mountains. He became acquainted with numerous cultures and languages such as Arabic, Ancient and Modern Greek, French, Italian, Ottoman Turkish and Persian. He was one of the few men to whom the literary culture of the Occident and Orient was equally familiar and valuable.

Upon the death of his father, he and his family settled to Ioannina where he earned initial inspiration for his future poetries written in the lyric and romantic style. After he suffered a severe lung infection, due to his congenital tuberculosis, in Constantinople, he joined his brother Abdyl in the fight for national freedom and consciousness of the Albanian people during the Albanian Renaissance in which he later became the most distinguished representative of that period.

=== Education ===

His religion paved the way for many of his future accomplishments.

In the Tekke of Frashër, he received lessons in all the common subjects of his time especially in languages such as Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and Persian. As a member of a family which gave him a strong Bektashi upbringing, he spent a part of his time in a Bektashi tekke. After the death of their parents, the family moved to Ioannina in 1865. The eldest brother, Abdyl (b. 1839), became the family head at the age of 22 and started working as a merchant. That year Naim and Sami enrolled in the Zosimaia secondary school. The education there provided Naim with the basics of a classical education along Western lines. Apart from languages he learned in the Zosiamaia (Ancient and Modern Greek, French and Italian), Naim took private lessons in Persian, Turkish and Arabic from two important local Bektashi.

After he finished his studies in 1870, Frashëri worked for a few months at the press office in Istanbul (1870) but was forced to return to his home village because of tuberculosis. The climate of Frashër helped Naim and soon he started work in the Ottoman bureaucracy as a clerk in Berat and later in Saranda (1872–1877). However, in 1876 Frashëri left the job and went to Baden, in modern Austria to cure his problems with rheumatism in a health resort.

===Politics===
In 1879, along with his brother Sami and 25 other Albanians, Naim Frashëri founded and was a member of the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings in Istanbul that promoted Albanian language publications. Ottoman authorities forbid writing in Albanian in 1885 which resulted in publications being published abroad and Frashëri used his initials N.H.F. to bypass those restrictions for his works. Later on, Albanian schools were established in 1887 in Southeastern Albania.

An Albanian magazine, &quot;Drita&quot;, appeared in 1884 under the editorship of Petro Poga and later Pandeli Sotiri with Naim Frashëri being a behind-the-scenes editor as it was not allowed by Ottoman authorities to write in Albanian at that time. Naim Frashëri and other Albanian writers like his brother Sami Frashëri would write using pseudonyms in Poga&#x27;s publication. Due to a lack of education material Naim Frashëri, his brother Sami and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in the Albanian language during the late 1880s for the Albanian school in Korçë. In a letter to Faik Konitza in 1887, Frashëri expressed sentiments regarding the precarious state of the Ottoman Empire that the best outcome for Albanians was a future annexation of all of Albania by Austria-Hungary.

In 1900 Naim Frashëri died in Istanbul. During the 1950s the Turkish government allowed for his remains to be sent and reburied in Albania.

== Career ==

=== Works ===

With its literary stature and the broad range of both stylistic and thematic content, Frashëri significantly contributed to the development of the modern Albanian literary language. The importance of his works lies less in his creative expression than in the social and political intention of his poetry and faith. His works were noted by the desire for the emergence of an independent Albanian unity that overcomes denominational and territorial differences, and by an optimistic belief in civilization and the political, economic and cultural rise of the Albanian people.
In his poem &quot;Bagëti e Bujqësi&quot;, Frashëri idyllically describes the natural and cultural beauty of Albania and the modest life of its people where nothing infringes on mystical euphoria and all conflicts find reconciliation and fascination.
Frashëri saw his liberal religion as a profound source for Albanian libration, tolerance and national awareness among his religiously divided people. He, therefore, composed his theological &quot;Fletore e Bektashinjet&quot; which is now a piece of national importance. It contains an introductory profession of his faith and ten spiritual poems granting a contemporary perspective into the beliefs of the sect.

=== Legacy ===

The prime representative of Romanticism in Albanian literature, Frashëri is considered by many to be the most distinguished Albanian poet of the Albanian Renaissance whose poetry continued to have a tremendous influence on the literature and society of the Albanian people in the 20th century. He is also widely regarded as the national poet of Albania and is celebrated as such among the Albanian people in Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and other Albanian-inhabited lands in the Balkans.

After his death, Frashëri became a great source of inspiration and a guiding light for the Albanian writers and intellectuals of the 20th century amongst them Asdreni, Gjergj Fishta, Mitrush Kuteli and Lasgush Poradeci. His great work such as &quot;Bagëti e Bujqësi&quot;, &quot;Gjuha Jonë&quot; and &quot;Feja&quot; promoted national unity, consciousness, and tolerance in the breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the culture and history of their ancestors.

Albanians of the Bektashi faith were in particular influenced and motivated by his work. Himself a Bektashi, he desired purity of the Albanian language and had attempted in his lifetime to Albanianise hierarchical terms of the order in his work &quot;Fletore e Bektashinjët&quot; which called for an Albanian Bektashism. His poem &quot;Bagëti e Bujqësi&quot; celebrated the natural beauty of Albania and the simple life of Albanian people while expressing gratitude that Albania had bestowed upon him &quot;the name Albanian&quot;. In &quot;Istori&#x27; e Skënderbeut&quot;, he celebrated his love for Albania by referring to the medieval battles between the Albanians and Ottomans while highlighting Skenderbeg&#x27;s Albanian origins and his successful fight for liberation. In &quot;Gjuha Jonë&quot;, he called for fellow Albanians to honour their nation and write in Albanian while in another poem &quot;Feja&quot;, he pleaded with Albanians not make religious distinctions among themselves as they all were of one origin that speak Albanian.

Numerous organizations, monuments, schools, and streets had been founded and dedicated to his memory throughout Albania, Kosovo as well as to a lesser extent in North Macedonia and Romania. His family&#x27;s house, where he was born and raised, in Frashër of Gjirokastër County is today a museum and was declared a monument of important cultural heritage. It houses numerous artefacts including handwritten manuscripts, portraits, clothing and the busts of him and his brothers Abdyl and Sami.

Frashëri&#x27;s portrait is depicted on the obverses of the 500 lek banknote from 1992 to 1996 and since 1996 on the 200 lekë banknote. On the reverse side of the bill is a picture of his family house in Frashër. The Albanian nation has established an order of merit that bears his name which was awarded to, amongst others, the Albanian nun and missionary Mother Teresa.

<text>The efficiency of a system in electronics and electrical engineering is defined as useful power output divided by the total electrical power consumed (a fractional expression), typically denoted by the Greek small letter eta (η – ήτα).

: formula_1
If energy output and input are expressed in the same units, efficiency is a dimensionless number. Where it is not customary or convenient to represent input and output energy in the same units, efficiency-like quantities have units associated with them. For example, the heat rate of a fossil fuel power plant may be expressed in BTU per kilowatt-hour. Luminous efficacy of a light source expresses the amount of visible light for a certain amount of power transfer and has the units of lumens per watt.

== Efficiency of typical electrical devices ==

&quot;Efficiency&quot; should not be confused with &quot;effectiveness&quot;: a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term &quot;efficiency&quot; makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A light bulb, for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the windows). An electronic amplifier that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a loudspeaker), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient. (10/20 × 100 = 50%)
* Electric kettle: more than 90% (comparatively little heat energy is lost during the 2 to 3 minutes a kettle takes to boil water).
* A premium efficiency electric motor: more than 90% &quot;(see Main Article: Premium efficiency).&quot;
* A large power transformer used in the electrical grid may have efficiency of more than 99%. Early 19th century transformers were much less efficient, wasting up to a third of the energy passing through them.
* A steam power plant used to generate electricity may have 30-40% efficiency.

== Efficiency of devices at point of maximum power transfer ==

As a result of the maximum power theorem, devices transfer maximum power to a load when running at 50% electrical efficiency. This occurs when the load resistance (of the device in question) is equal to the internal Thevenin equivalent resistance of the power source. This is valid only for non-reactive source and load impedances.

== Efficiency of light bulbs ==

== Discussion ==
High efficiency is particularly relevant in systems that can operate from batteries. Inefficiency may require weighing the cost either of the wasted energy, or of the required power supply, against the cost of attaining greater efficiency. Efficiency can usually be improved by choosing different components or by redesigning the system. Inefficiency probably produces extra heat within the system, which must be removed if it is to remain within its operating temperature range. In a climate-controlled environment, like a home or office, heat generated by appliances may reduce heating costs or increase air conditioning costs.

Impedance bridging connections have a load impedance much larger than the source, which helps transfer voltage signals at high electrical efficiency.

<doc id="327513" wikidata="Q409444" url="?curid=327513" title="H2 receptor antagonist">
<text>H2 antagonists, sometimes referred to as H2RAs and also called H2 blockers, are a class of medications that block the action of histamine at the histamine H2 receptors of the parietal cells in the stomach. This decreases the production of stomach acid. H2 antagonists can be used in the treatment of dyspepsia, peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease. They have been surpassed by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The PPI omeprazole was found to be more effective at both healing and alleviating symptoms of ulcers and reflux oesophagitis than the H2 blockers ranitidine and cimetidine.
H2 antagonists, which all end in &quot;-tidine&quot;, are a type of antihistamine. In general usage, however, the term &quot;antihistamine&quot; typically refers to H1 antagonists, which relieve allergic reactions. Like the H1 antagonists, some H2 antagonists function as inverse agonists rather than receptor antagonists, due to the constitutive activity of these receptors.

The prototypical H2 antagonist, called cimetidine, was developed by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline &amp; French – now GlaxoSmithKline – in the mid-to-late 1960s. It was first marketed in 1976 and sold under the trade name Tagamet, which became the first blockbuster drug. The use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) led to the development of other agents – starting with ranitidine, first sold as Zantac, which was thought to have a better adverse effect profile (later disproven), fewer drug interactions and be more potent.

==Class members==
* cimetidine (Tagamet)
* ranitidine (Zantac) (withdrawn in USA, suspended in EU and Australia for carcinogenic metabolites)
* famotidine (Pepcid)
* nizatidine (Tazac, Axid)
* roxatidine 
* lafutidine (Stogar, Lafaxid, Ildong Lafutidine)
* lavoltidine (discontinued as carcinogen)
* niperotidine (withdrawn as causing liver damage)
* sufotidine

== History and development ==
Cimetidine was the prototypical histamine H2 receptor antagonist from which later drugs were developed. Cimetidine was the culmination of a project at Smith, Kline &amp; French (SK&amp;F; now GlaxoSmithKline) by James W. Black, C. Robin Ganellin, and others to develop a histamine receptor antagonist that would suppress stomach acid secretion.

In 1964, it was known that histamine stimulated the secretion of stomach acid, and also that traditional antihistamines had no effect on acid production. From these facts the SK&amp;F scientists postulated the existence of two different types of histamine receptors. They designated the one acted upon by the traditional antihistamines as H1, and the one acted upon by histamine to stimulate the secretion of stomach acid as H2.

The SK&amp;F team used a classical design process starting from the structure of histamine. Hundreds of modified compounds were synthesised in an effort to develop a model of the then-unknown H2 receptor. The first breakthrough was &quot;Nα&quot;-guanylhistamine, a partial H2receptor antagonist. From this lead, the receptor model was further refined, which eventually led to the development of burimamide, a specific competitive antagonist at the H2 receptor. Burimamide is 100 times more potent than &quot;Nα&quot;-guanylhistamine, proving its efficacy on the H2 receptor.

The potency of burimamide was still too low for oral administration. And efforts on further improvement of the structure, based on the structure modification in the stomach due to the acid dissociation constant of the compound, led to the development of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; however, it was associated with unacceptable nephrotoxicity and agranulocytosis. It was proposed that the toxicity arose from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the discovery of cimetidine, which would become the first clinically successful H2 antagonist.

Ranitidine (common brand name Zantac) was developed by Glaxo (also now GlaxoSmithKline), in an effort to match the success of Smith, Kline &amp; French with cimetidine. Ranitidine was also the result of a rational drug design process utilising the by-then-fairly-refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Glaxo refined the model further by replacing the imidazole-ring of cimetidine with a furan-ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine, which was found to have a much better tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and ten times the activity of cimetidine.

Ranitidine was introduced in 1981 and was the world&#x27;s biggest-selling prescription drug by 1988. The H2 receptor antagonists have since largely been superseded by the even more effective proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), with omeprazole becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years.

== Pharmacology ==
The H2 antagonists are competitive antagonists of histamine at the parietal cell&#x27;s H2 receptor. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: Histamine released by enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL) in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors, which stimulate acid secretion; therefore, other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.

== Clinical uses ==
H2 antagonists are used by clinicians in the treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal conditions, including:

* Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD)
* Dyspepsia
* Prevention of stress ulcer (a specific indication of ranitidine)
* Prevention of aspiration pneumonitis during surgery. Oral H2 antagonists reduce gastric acidity and volume and have shown to reduce the frequency of aspiration pneumonitis; however, this aspiration benefit has not been shown with IV H2antagonists.

People who suffer from infrequent heartburn may take either antacids or H2 receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2 antagonists offer several advantages over antacids, including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for antacids), greater efficacy, and ability to be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of heartburn occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for erosive esophagitis since they have been shown to promote healing better than H2antagonists.

== Adverse effects ==
H2 antagonists are generally well tolerated, with the exception of cimetidine, which more commonly elicits the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) than other H2 antagonists: 

Infrequent ADRs include hypotension. Rare ADRs include headache, tiredness, dizziness, confusion, diarrhea, constipation, and rash. In addition, gynecomastia occurred in 0.1% to 0.5% of men treated for non-hypersecretory conditions with cimetidine for 1 month or longer and in about 2% of men treated for pathologic hypersecretory conditions; in even fewer men, cimetidine may also cause loss of libido, and impotence, all of which are reversible upon discontinuation.

A 31-study review found that the overall risk of pneumonia is about 1 in 4 higher among H2 antagonist users.

According to a 2022 umbrella review of meta-analyses, the use of H2 receptor antagonist is associated with pneumonia, peritonitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection, liver cancer, gastric cancer, and hip fracture diseases.

Famotidine has been associated with agranulocytosis, the destruction of white blood cells.

== Research ==
=== Bladder diseases ===
Histamine can cause bladder inflammation and contribute to the symptoms of such bladder diseases as cystitis (inflammation of the bladder) or painful bladder disease. Histamine binds to H2 receptors in the bladder smooth muscle, leading to relaxation of the bladder muscle and promotion of urine storage. Histamine does not seem to have a direct role in the development of bladder diseases, but it can contribute to bladder inflammation and associated symptoms.

H2 receptors in the bladder play a role in regulating bladder contraction. 

H2 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce bladder contractions and improve bladder function in animal studies. Blocking the activation of H2 receptors in the bladder leads to decreased bladder contractions and improved urine storage. While H2 receptor antagonists may have a potential role in managing bladder conditions such as overactive bladder, they are not typically used in treating cystitis or painful bladder disease, and their mechanism of action in bladder diseases is still not fully understood. There is limited research that histamine H2 receptor antagonists can potentially alleviate symptoms of cystitis or painful bladder disease.

== Drug interactions ==

With regard to pharmacokinetics, cimetidine in particular interferes with some of the body&#x27;s mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, labetalol, metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

The more recently developed H2receptor antagonists are less likely to alter CYP metabolism. Ranitidine is not as potent a CYP inhibitor as cimetidine, although it still shares several of the latter&#x27;s interactions (such as with warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, metoprolol, and midazolam). Famotidine has negligible effect on the CYP system, and appears to have no significant interactions.

<text>Loca Records is a British independent electronica and post rock record label based in Brighton, England. All the music, artwork and videos are released under copyleft licenses and distributed physically on vinyl, CD, and cassette. Inspired by the free software movement, Loca Records allows similar freedoms as the GNU General Public License on their releases, including copying, re-release, modification, and sampling, with the requirement that the new work uses the same license.

== Artists ==
The roster of artists releasing work on LOCA Records includes the following; 
* Dot
* Meme &quot;(David Meme)&quot;
* Maz Plant Out &quot;(Marion Bouyssonnade – chant, corps sonores; Fleur Galasso – piano, guitare, chant; Mylène Duhec – basse, violoncelle; Widad Abdessemed – violon; Laurent Bouyssonade – batterie)&quot;
* ML
* OJN &quot;(currently released on Arkward Silence)&quot;
* Snø
* Ward &quot;(David Meme and Richard Williams, also released on Static Caravan)&quot;
* Xan &quot;(featuring Lisa Elle from Dark Horses)&quot;

== Licensing ==
Loca&#x27;s first and second release in 1999, &quot;Kinematic&quot; and the &quot;Mandibles EP&quot;, were released under the GNU General Public License and subsequent releases have been on the EFF Open Audio License. Loca is now releasing all work under the Creative Commons license known as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

One notable difference between the Creative Commons license and free/open source licenses, such as the GPL, is that it does not require making the raw unmixed tracks available, whereas free/open source software has the underlying source code available. Loca is planning a true free content/open source release with the new ML album which will contain a selection of samples used to make the track along with the music on a computer-readable data section of the CD.

== Finance ==
Loca receives money from selling CDs and Records. Following the example of free and open source software distributors, this money is reinvested in new talent and to encourage more experimentation.

<text>Raymond Bingham (born 16 April 1967 in Streatham, London, England), better known as Grooverider, is a British drum and bass DJ. He and DJ partner Fabio are regarded as &quot;originators&quot; of the scene.

==Biography==
Grooverider began his DJing at illegal raves and warehouse parties in the UK in the late 1980s, and rose to prominence with partner Fabio through his sets at club nights such as the groundbreaking &#x27;Rage&#x27; at Heaven. Grooverider was also on the London pirate radio station, Faze 1, in the mid-1980s alongside Fabio and DJs including Colin Dale, Dave Angel, and Booker T. He originally played soul, hip hop and disco but later played house, upon being converted whilst hearing &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot; by Mr. Fingers.

Fabio and Grooverider began playing house at Mendoza&#x27;s in Brixton. From there the pair went on to a venue in Barrington Road in Brixton, but it was not until 1991 that they would really make their mark. That year, Grooverider and Fabio took up a residency at Rage. Throughout the 1990s, Grooverider released tracks as Codename John and helped build the reputations of Matrix and Boymerang with releases on his own record label, Prototype.

With Fabio, he hosted a radio show on Kiss 100 from 1994 to 1997. In 1997, Grooverider compiled the album &quot;Prototype Years&quot; which featured the best tracks by various artists who appeared on his label. Prototype is known for its sporadic releases, which have included drum and bass work by Dillinja, Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith, Ed Rush, Photek and Optical. In 1998, he and Fabio brought their radio show to a national audience on BBC Radio 1.

As a recording artist, Grooverider has released one album, &quot;Mysteries of Funk&quot; (Sony 1998), produced in conjunction with Optical, and a number of remixes including his reworkings of Jonny L&#x27;s &quot;Piper&quot; plus Roni Size/Reprazent&#x27;s &quot;Share the Fall&quot;. In 2005, he was holding a weekly Sunday session called Grace at the London club, Herbal.

On 24 November 2007, Grooverider was arrested at Dubai International Airport for possession of 2.16 grams of cannabis, which he claimed he had forgotten was in a pair of his trousers. &quot;I must have forgotten the spliff,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;It was a small amount. Back home I would not even get prosecuted.&quot; On 19 February 2008, he was sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment, to be followed by immediate deportation (four years is the mandatory sentence for drug possession in the United Arab Emirates). He was pardoned and released on 3 September 2008, during the holy month of Ramadan that traditionally sees the pardoning of select prisoners in UAE. In an interview with BBC, Grooverider described his experience and the conditions in which he was placed as &quot;appalling&quot;.

Grooverider returned to the BBC Radio 1 drum and bass show with Fabio in October 2008, until it finally ended in March 2012. Since September 2016, they have brought their long-running radio show to London&#x27;s Rinse FM.

<text>Barbarella is a fictional heroine in a French science fiction comic book created by Jean-Claude Forest.

==History==
Jean-Claude Forest created the character of Barbarella for serialization in the French &quot;V Magazine&quot; in spring 1962. In 1964 Éric Losfeld published these strips as a stand-alone book titled &quot;Barbarella&quot;. The book caused a scandal and became known as the first &quot;adult&quot; (erotic) comic book, though American pornographic comic books known as &quot;Tijuana bibles&quot; had long predated it. For her creator, the character embodied the modern, emancipated woman in the era of sexual liberation, and as a result, this literary work has come to be associated with the mid-20th century sexual revolution. The comic would stop publishing in 1978.

Barbarella was relaunched as an ongoing series by the American publisher Dynamite Entertainment in December 2017. The creative team included writer Mike Carey and artist Kenan Yarar. The comic would be supervised by Jean-Marc Lofficier, who worked with the original creator. It ran for 12 issues with a holiday special.

Another relaunch was announced in May 2021, with writer Sarah Hoyt and artist Madibek Musabekov. This run continued for 10 issues.

After the announcement of a movie remake, Dynamite announced in November 2022 it would relaunch the comic with the title &quot;Barbarella: The Center Cannot Hold&quot;. Sarah Hoyt would return as writer, this time joined by artist Riccardo Bogani&quot;.&quot; In July 2024, a new series was announced with writer Blake Northcott and artist Anna Morozova. This iteration of the comic will return more closely to Jean-Claude Forest&#x27;s concept for the original comic series.

<text>The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (, abbreviated FMLN) is a Salvadoran political party and former guerrilla rebel group.

The FMLN was formed as an umbrella group on 10 October 1980, from five leftist guerrilla organizations; the Farabundo Martí Popular Liberation Forces (FPL), the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), the National Resistance (RN), the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES) and the Revolutionary Party of the Central American Workers (PRTC). The FMLN was one of the main participants in the Salvadoran Civil War. After the Chapultepec Peace Accords were signed in 1992, all armed FMLN units were demobilized and their organization became a legal left-wing political party in El Salvador.

On 15 March 2009, the FMLN won the presidential elections with former journalist Mauricio Funes as its candidate. Two months earlier in municipal and legislative elections, the FMLN won the majority of the mayoralties in the country and a plurality of the Legislative Assembly seats. Funes is now wanted by the Salvadoran authority for corrupt actions, such as illegally laundering more than $700,000 in his personal bank account and was found guilty of illegal enrichment by the Supreme Court. Funes and his son fled to Nicaragua, where they were granted political asylum by Daniel Ortega and became citizens.

== Civil war and emergence ==
Tensions began to build between the farmers and the elite class in the time leading up to the Salvadoran Civil War including political assassinations by the Salvadoran government on outspoken critics starting in the early 1970s. In 1979, farmers went on strike for higher wages and better working conditions on Hacienda California, a large farm in Tierra Blanca. Due to this strike, National Guard troops responded to the growing violence in Tierra Blanca using military force. As the violence spread into the residential areas of El Salvador, animosity heightened between the campesinos and the elite class. The previously politically withdrawn campesinos began to join the FMLN and other left-wing guerrilla groups.

On 17 December 1979, in a period of national crisis, the three dominant organizations (FPL, RN and PCS) of the Salvadoran left formed the (CPM). The CPM&#x27;s first manifesto was released on 10 January 1980, and the day after, the was formed as a union of revolutionary mass organizations. CRM later merged with the to form the .

It is alleged by the United States that some credit for the unity of the five organizations that formed the FMLN may belong to Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, who facilitated negotiation between the groups in Havana in December 1979. However, neither the Cuban nor Soviet government were significantly responsible for forming FMLN, although it received some of its arms and supplies from the Soviet Union and Cuba. While all five groups called themselves revolutionaries and socialists, they had serious ideological and practical differences, and there had been serious conflicts, even including in some cases bloodshed, between some of the groups during the 1970s.

On 22 May 1980, the success of negotiations led to the union of the major guerrilla forces under one flag. The Unified Revolutionary Directorate () was created by the FPL, RN, ERP and PCS. DRU consisted of three Political Commission members from each of these four organizations. The DRU manifesto declared, &quot;There will be only one leadership, only one military plan and only one command, only one political line.&quot; Despite continued infighting, DRU succeeded in coordinating the group&#x27;s efforts and equipped forces.
On 10 October 1980, the four organizations formed the Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional (FMLN), taking the name of Farabundo Martí, the peasant leader during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre. In December 1980, the Salvadoran branch of the broke away from its central organization and affiliated itself to FMLN. Thus the FMLN was composed of the following organizations at the time of the peace accords in 1992 (listed in the order of size):
* (BPR), armed wing , (FPL)
* (PCS), armed wing (FAL)
* (PRS), armed wing , ERP (El Salvador)
* (RN), armed wing (RN-FARN)
* (PRTC), armed wing , (ERTC)

Youth organizations of FMLN at the time of armed struggle included:
Student unions (High Schools):
* MERS – 
* BRES – 
* LPS – 
* AES – 
* ARDES – 

Student unions (Universities):
* AGEUS – 
* FUERSA – 

== Armed struggle ==

After the formation of the FMLN, the group organized its first major military offensive on 10 January 1981. During this offensive, the FMLN established operational control over large sections of Morazán and Chalatenango departments, which remained largely under guerrilla control throughout the rest of the civil war. Insurgents ranged from children to the elderly, both male and female, and most were trained in FMLN camps in the mountains and forests of El Salvador to learn military techniques.

Another large FMLN offensive was in November 1989. In that offensive, the FMLN caught the Salvadoran government and military off guard by taking control of large sections of the country and entering the capital, San Salvador. In San Salvador, the FMLN quickly took control of many of the poor neighborhoods until denied support of violence and tried to avoid being at risk and involved in the conflict as the military bombed their positions—including residential neighborhoods to drive the FMLN out. One of the most famous battles in San Salvador took place in the Sheraton Hotel, where guerrillas and army soldiers battled floor by floor. The FMLN&#x27;s November 1989 offensive did not succeed in overthrowing the government. Many analysts pointed to the FMLN&#x27;s show of strength in the 1989 offensive as the turning point in the war, where it became clear that the government would not be able to defeat the FMLN militarily. Soon after the November 1989 offensive, the U.S. government started to support negotiations to end the civil war, whereas up to that point they had pursued a policy of military defeat of the FMLN. Since the U.S. government was the major funder of the Salvadoran government and military, it exercised considerable influence over the course of events. When the U.S. began to advocate negotiations instead of a military solution, a negotiated peace accord between the FMLN and the Salvadoran government was reached in fairly short order in 1992, despite a few incidents that could have marred the accord, such as the high-profile murder of the peace-seeking FPL commandante Antonio Cardenal, aka Jesus Rojas.

The United Nations has estimated that the FMLN guerrillas were responsible for 5% of the murders of civilians during the civil war, while approximately 85% of all killings of civilians were committed by the Salvadoran armed forces and death squads.

== After the peace accords: participation in elections ==

After the ceasefire established by the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Accords, the FMLN became a legal political party. The FMLN has now participated in elections since 1994.
The FMLN and the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) are the two dominant political parties in El Salvador. Since 2000, the FMLN has gone back and forth with ARENA in controlling the largest number of Legislative Assembly seats. The FMLN has controlled the mayor&#x27;s offices in many of the large cities of El Salvador since 1997, including the capital, San Salvador, and the neighboring city Santa Tecla. The FMLN mayor of San Salvador, was Violeta Menjívar, the first female mayor of San Salvador, who was elected in a narrow victory in 2006. The death of the FMLN&#x27;s long standing leader, Jorge Schafik, boosted Violeta Menjivar&#x27;s political campaign which ultimately led her to narrow win in the election of San Salvador&#x27;s mayor. Schafik&#x27;s death also boosted several FMLN political candidates running for positions in El Salvador&#x27;s Legislative Assembly. The FMLN mayor of Santa Tecla was Oscar Ortiz, who served in that position since 2000.

In the legislative elections, held on 16 March 2003, the FMLN won 34% of the popular vote and 31 out of 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador, becoming the political party with the most assembly members. The FMLN&#x27;s candidate in the 21 March 2004 presidential election, Schafik Hándal, won 35.6% of the vote, but was defeated by Antonio Saca of ARENA.

In the 2006 legislative election, held on 12 March 2006, the FMLN won 39.7% of the popular vote and 32 out of 84 legislative assembly seats. The FMLN also retained the mayor&#x27;s seats in the largest cities of El Salvador, San Salvador and Santa Tecla, and hundreds of other municipalities. This was possible because one of the largest progressive coalitions in El Salvador called The Popular Social Bloc formed a pact with FMLN to help the political party win more seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, most other coalitions and groups dedicated to social change have kept away from the political party. Two months before the elections of 2009, however, the FMLN lost the mayoralty of San Salvador.

At the 18 January 2009 legislative elections, FMLN won 42.6% of the vote and 35 seats. FMLN is the largest party in the Salvadoran legislature, though it did not have a governing majority.

On 15 March 2009, the FMLN&#x27;s candidate Mauricio Funes won the presidential elections. He was inaugurated in June 2009 as the first president coming from the FMLN party. The FMLN also organized support groups during the 2009 election in order to secure votes as well as gaining more volunteers to help in the upcoming elections.

In March 2014, Vice President of El Salvador from 2009 to 2014, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, was elected as the new President of El Salvador. Cerén&#x27;s presidential win assured the FMLN would have a party member in the presidential office for another five years.

== Post-war splits and internal changes ==
At the end of the civil war in 1992, the FMLN became a legal political party. At the end of the war, the FMLN still comprised the five political parties—FPL, CP, ERP, RN, PRTC—each of which retained its own organizational structure but with a leader. During the civil war, and continuing in the post-war period, people did not directly join the FMLN &quot;per se&quot;, but joined one of the five component groups.

=== 1994 – ERP and RN leaders split ===
After the end of the war, it became clear that there were serious divisions within the FMLN, some of which had existed during the war but had been somewhat hidden from the general public. Particularly it became clear between 1992 and 1994 that the leaders of the ERP and the RN had a number of disagreements with the leaders of the other parties. Soon after the 1994 Legislative Assembly elections, the leaders of the ERP and the RN left the FMLN, and took many of their members with them. The leaders of this split (including FMLN commandante Joaquin Villalobos of the ERP) then formed the (Democratic Party), which was short-lived. Many members of the ERP and RN who had left in 1994 then returned to the FMLN.

=== 1995 – Dissolving the five organizations to become a single party ===
After the 1994 elections and the 1994 split, momentum grew to unify the FMLN into a single organization without separate internal parties. In 1995, the five parties that had formed the FMLN dissolved themselves. It is at that point that the FPL, CP, ERP, RN and PRTC ceased to exist, and what remained was a unified FMLN. Then people could join the FMLN directly instead of having to join one of its component parties. While this decision liquidated the parallel organizational structures inside the FMLN, there still remained strong loyalties along historic organizational lines, some of which can still be seen today.

=== Renovadores split ===
In the 1999 presidential election, the FMLN ran Facundo Guardado as its candidate. This was a contentious decision, and many in the FMLN did not support Guardado, as they believed that his politics were moving to the right. Out of this internal conflict, two organized tendencies emerged in the FMLN—the (&quot;Renovators&quot; or &quot;Renewal Movement&quot;) and the (CRS—Revolutionary Socialist Current). The two main leaders of the CRS were the historic FMLN leaders Schafik Hándal and Salvador Sanchez Ceren. The main leader of the was Facundo Guardado. As a charismatic former FPL commander, Guardado had a base of supporters in the FMLN. He criticized the historic leadership as being too communist and called for a renovated ideology. The CRS criticized Guardado for advocating social democratic politics and for not being clearly against neoliberalism.

After a couple years of internal turmoil, in which the Revolutionary Socialist Current won the majority of the internal elections in the organization, Guardado became more frustrated, publicly attacked the FMLN leaders he didn&#x27;t agree with, and took actions contrary to decisions the party had made. He was expelled from the party and some of his supporters left the FMLN. Guardado tried to form the as its own political party, but they received negligible support in the 2003 election and then ceased to exist as a party.

After the vs Revolutionary Socialist Current factionalism, the FMLN&#x27;s leadership decided to stop organized internal tendencies, and none have emerged since then.

=== 2005 – FDR split ===
In 2004 and 2005, the FMLN experienced another split. Five FMLN Legislative Assembly members and a number of their supporters left the FMLN to form a new political party, the Democratic Revolutionary Front (). Some of the principal leaders of this split were Ileana Rogel and Francisco Jovel. The people who left to form the FDR chose this name because it has a legacy in the Salvadoran movement; an organization by the same name was formed under the leadership of the FMLN during the civil war to bring together parties and individuals doing legal political work during the civil war. As opposed to previous splits from the FMLN which openly proclaimed that they were ideologically &#x27;center&#x27; or &#x27;center-left&#x27; or were no longer self-declared &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, the people who split to form the FDR claimed to still be part of the leftist legacy of the FMLN. In the 2006 elections, no FDR candidates won office, except for the incumbent mayor of Nejapa, Rene Canjura. Canjura was a popular FMLN mayor of the municipality of Nejapa for three consecutive periods, and therefore under FMLN statutes, would not have been eligible to run for a fourth consecutive period. So he left the FMLN and successfully ran in 2006 as the FDR candidate. No other FDR candidates won any electoral victories in 2006.

=== 2009 and 2014 – FMLN candidates elected president ===
On Sunday, 15 March 2009, an FMLN candidate, Mauricio Funes, was elected President of El Salvador. On 10 February 2016, the El Salvador Supreme Court ruled that Funes would face a civil trial for charges of illegally laundering more than $700,000 in personal bank accounts. On 28 November 2017, El Salvador&#x27;s second civil court found Funes guilty of illegal enrichment.

In 2014 election Salvador Sánchez Cerén of FMLN was narrowly elected as the new President of El Salvador.

=== In opposition (2019–) ===

FMLN lost both 2019 presidential election and 2021 legislative election dominated by new Nuevas Ideas party of President Nayib Bukele.

In the 2024 general election, FMLN lost all seats in both the legislative and municipal branches, becoming an extra-parliamentary party for the first time since participating in elections in 1994.

== Ideology ==
The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front was heavily inspired by Cuban Revolution and was based on Marxism-Leninism as well as liberation theology. The communist foundations of the party were however not aligned with Soviet communism, but with &quot;Western Marxism&quot; that developed from the ideology of Ernest Mandel, Trường Chinh and most importantly Ché Guevara; Marxist-Leninist thought was infused with the concepts of revolutionary nationalism and national liberation, and lack of national autonomy was considered an expression of landowning elite&#x27;s interests. Liberation theology, which in case of FMLN represents a strand of Catholic socialism, was developed by radicalized priests connecting to the most depressed areas of El Salvador, founding Christian-based communities and worker associations and supporting rural communities through charity work and literacy campaigns. Middle-class youth of Catholic universities became exposed to the misery of the Salvadoran working class, and the teaching of liberation theology provided them with justification of violence and armed struggle in name of improving working and living conditions.

Catholic clergy had a prominent role within the FLMN, as apart from being considered &quot;authentic representatives&quot; of Salvadoran people that legitimatized and popularized FMLN in the eyes of Salvadoran peasantry, Catholic priests would also join the party directly and become guerrillas, with at least one priest becoming a commander. Because of this, FMLN was described as &quot;the merging of the popular church and the political opposition&quot;. This was augmented with Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) overthrowing the Nicaraguan government in the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution. In response to the growing radicalization and opposition to Somoza amongst the Church, FSLN incorporated a Catholic message into its program; this was augmented by left-wing Catholic organizations such as the Movimiento Cristiano Revolucionario joining the FSLN, whose members would assume high responsibilities within the Sandinista government. The Sandinistas were a source of inspiration and support for the FMLN. 

FMLN was born through liberation theology priests who promoted the &quot;conscientization&quot; of the Salvadoran working class, who argued that their desperation and poverty was not &quot;God&#x27;s will or the result of their own failures&quot; but rather the consequence of capitalism; the party would even earn the support of Archbishop Óscar Romero, who believed that oppressive conditions made some forms of violence acceptable, stating: &quot;Christians are not afraid of combat; they know how to fight, but they prefer the language of peace. However, when a dictatorship seriously violates human rights and attacks the common good of the nation, when it becomes unbearable and closes all channels of dialogue, when this happens, the Church speaks of the legitimate right of insurrectional violence.&quot; The clergy was further radicalized after Romero was murdered by a right-wing death squad, with priests such as Rogelio Poncel fleeing to mountains and joining the Marxist-Leninist ERP guerillas there, which would later become one of the co-founders of the FMLN. Justifying his decision, Poncel wrote: &quot;The Bible confronts the established order. It must be seen from the point of view of the poor, and Christ was poor ... A Christian, a priest, must of necessity be a revolutionary. How can we conform what we preach with a system that oppresses and exploits?&quot; Given the Catholic nature of the movement, most FMLN members and guerilla fighters were Catholics who &quot;understood revolution in the language of religion&quot;.

The FMLN has a symbiotic relationship with the Catholic Church marked by mutual support, leading political scientists to compare the party to the similarly pro-Catholic Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua. FMLN worked closely together with the Revolutionary Democratic Front led by Catholic Democrats who rebelled against the government following the murder of Enrique Álvarez Córdova. The FMLN built an extensive network of ties and connections to Salvadoran Catholic Democrats through churches and other religious organizations, with rural church-run communities known as Christian Base Communities (CEBs) becoming the main source of party&#x27;s support, shelter and recruitment. Through liberation theology, Salvadoran clergy would radicalize the local peasantry into joining and aiding the FMLN; in 1977, one Jesuit remarked: &quot;Slowly the peasants began to abandon their fatalism, slowly they began to understand that their hunger, their disease, their infant mortality, their unemployment, their unpaid wages, were not the will of God but the result of the greed of a few Salvadorans and of their own passivism.&quot;

Being initially a mix of Marxism-Leninism and liberation theology, the FMLN would moderate in the late 1980s and hold peace talks with the Salvadoran government, demanding power-sharing and transition to democratic rule. The leaders of FMLN and FDR established alliances and agreements with social-democrats figures from Latin America, Canada and Europe, which caused their political mutation as the prospect of a negotiated settlement became more and more possible. After building a potent front of social democratic governments of Europe and Latin America that opposed U.S. policy in Central America, the FMLN gradually abandoned Marxism-Leninism and embraced democratic socialism between 1988 and 1991 while maintaining its close ties to the Catholic Church. Catholic allies of the FMLN would call the moderation of the party &quot;its own aggiornamento, its own Vatican II.&quot;

== Party structure ==
The FMLN&#x27;s headquarters is located at 11 Poniente Street N. 1316. Colonia Layco in San Salvador, the country&#x27;s capital city.

<text>José Cruz Dilan (born August 8, 1947), nicknamed &quot;Cheo&quot;, is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player, coach and baseball front office executive. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from 1970 to 1988, most prominently as a member of the Houston Astros.

The left-hand hitting Cruz was one of the most popular players in Houston Astros team history, leading the team to their first-ever division title and postseason berth in .
A two-time All-Star, Cruz hit .300 or above for the Astros six times, won two Silver Slugger Awards and led the National League in hits in while playing his home games in the cavernous, pitcher-friendly Houston Astrodome. He finished in the top ten of the National League Most Valuable Player Award voting three times and won a record four Astros team MVP awards. He was the all-time leader in hits for the Astros (1,937) until being passed by Craig Biggio. Cruz was twice named as the Astros&#x27; nominee for the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his humanitarian efforts. He also played for the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees.

After his playing career, Cruz spent several years as the Houston Astros&#x27; first base coach and is currently a community outreach executive for the Astros. He is a member of one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most famous Major League families and is the brother of former Major Leaguers Héctor Cruz and Tommy Cruz. His son, José Cruz Jr., is also a former Major League outfielder. The Astros honored Cruz&#x27;s career accomplishments on October 3, 1992 by permanently retiring his jersey number 25. In 2019, Cruz was inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame. Cruz still holds the Astros team record for career triples 35 years after his retirement with 80.

==Career==
Cruz signed with the St. Louis Cardinals straight after graduating as a four-sport star at Arroyo High School in 1966. Years of minor league play resulted in him entering the majors as a September call-up in 1970, where he played six games and had six hits. The following year, he was called back up to the Cardinals on June 28, where he would play in 83 of the next 85 games primarily as a center fielder, batting .274 with a .377 on-base percentage (OBP), nine home runs, eighty hits, 49 walks, and 35 strikeouts.

The next year, he was the starting center fielder for the Cardinals on Opening Day. He would play in 117 of 156 games, which included a slump where he batted below .200 the whole month of June. He finished with a .235 average with 23 RBIs and 78 hits (both down from before) while having more strikeouts than walks. The next year, he played in 132 games for the team, where he batted a .227/.310/.379 line with 92 hits and 57 RBIs while also having 66 strikeouts (the most he would have for four seasons) and 51 walks. 1974 proved to be his last year with the team. He played in 107 games, with his .261/.341/.416 (batting average/OBP/slugging percentage) being his second best of four full years with the club. His career took an upswing when he was sold to the Houston Astros on October 24.

He made his debut for the Astros for their Opening Day start in 1975 as the right fielder and proved key in a 5-2 win with a key three-run home run in the fifth inning to break a 2-2 tie that led to a win for the team as he went 3-for-4. In 120 games, he batted .257/.358/.403 while garnering 81 hits, 52 walks and 44 strikeouts (the first of five seasons where his strikeouts weren&#x27;t higher than his walk count). After the Astros posted an 81–81 record in 1974, the team traded first baseman Lee May to the Baltimore Orioles, which allowed Astros left fielder Bob Watson to move the first base, opening the left field position to Cruz or teammate Greg Gross. By 1976, Cruz had secured the left field spot (although he would play right field for 1977 and 1978). With the exception of the late Roberto Clemente, Cruz was arguably the most famous baseball player in Puerto Rico during his playing career.
It was 1980 that proved big for Cruz and the Astros. In 160 games for the team, he would hit .302/.360/.426 while garnering a selection to the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first ever for him. His efforts proved key to the Astros making the postseason for the first time in team history. To get to the postseason, the Astros had to win a tie-breaker game with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the first inning, he helped to score the first run of the game after hitting a ball that got him to first base on a fielder&#x27;s choice while scoring the runner on third base.

The 1980 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies proved a close series (all but Game 1 went to extra innings), and Cruz proved important in numerous games. In Game 2, he broke a 2-2 tie with an eighth inning single to score Joe Morgan. When the Phillies came back to even it, he stepped up in the tenth inning with runners on first and second on one out with a single that was the first of four runs in the inning as the Astros evened up the series. In the do-or-die Game 5, he scored the first run of the game on a two-out double in the first inning. An intentional walk in the seventh with two outs proved important as the Astros scored three runs on two subsequent hits and a wild pitch that scored Cruz. While the Phillies made up for it in the top of the eighth inning to lead 7-5, Cruz and the Astros fought back to tie in the bottom half, as Cruz helped score the tying run on a two-out single. However, the Astros could not hang on for the tenth inning, as Garry Maddox scored in the winning run on a two-out double to seal the fate of the Astros (who had lost the last two games needing just one more win for the pennant). On the whole, Cruz batted .400 with four RBIs, six hits, eight walks, and one strikeout.

He continued some of his success with the following year. He played in 107 games (out of 110 possible games, owing to the strike) while batting .267/.319/.425 with 109 hits and 55 RBIs while having his second of four straight years with more strikeouts than walks (49 to 35). Despite this, he finished 14th in MVP voting as the Astros found ways to manage the strike-shortened season by winning the second half of the year and advancing to play the first half winner Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1981 National League Division Series, he batted .300 in five games while having six hits and one stolen base, although the Astros would blow a 2-0 series lead by losing the next three on the road.

In 1984, he continued his successes with the team. He played in 160 games once again while batting .312/.381/.462 and having 95 RBIs, 22 stolen bases, and 187 hits. He reversed his troubles with strikeouts, having 73 walks and 68 strikeouts while leading the league in sacrifice hits with ten. He finished eighth in MVP voting while winning his second and last Silver Slugger Award. He was named player of the month for July, having raised his batting average from .266 to .313 in 29 games played.

The Astros returned to the postseason in 1986. While Cruz would bat in all six games, he only hit .192 with just five hits and two RBIs. 1987 was his final year with the Astros. He played in 126 games (the lowest in a full season since 1976) while batting .241/.307/.400, including 88 hits and 38 RBIs while walking 36 times and striking out 65 times.

He signed with the New York Yankees in . He played in 38 games before being released on July 22. He had a .200/.273/.263 line with seven RBIs and eight strikeouts/walks. He had a total of 165 home runs and 1,077 RBI during his career, while hitting for a .284 batting average.

Cruz was involved in the Astros&#x27; first nine postseason appearances: three as a player (1980, 1981 and 1986) and six as a coach (1997–1999, 2001, 2004–2005). As a player in the postseason, he hit .400 in the five-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 NLCS. Cruz represented the Astros in the MLB All-Star Game in 1980 in Los Angeles and 1985 in Minnesota. He finished third in NL MVP voting in 1980, sixth in 1983, and eighth in 1984. He won the NL Silver Slugger Award as an outfielder in 1983 and 1984. In 1983, Cruz led the NL in hits with 189.

Cruz had played in more games than any other player in the history of the Houston franchise (1,870) before being passed by Craig Biggio in 2001. In 2000, Cruz coached from first base as Biggio surpassed many of his other long-standing franchise records, including at-bats, hits, and total bases. His eighty triples remains an Astros&#x27; record, as does his six career walk-off home runs. His last home run, in his last career at bat, was a pinch-hit grand slam on July 17, 1988, in a 7–4 loss against the Chicago White Sox.

==Post-playing career==
On October 3, 1992, Cruz was honored by the Astros when the team retired his number 25; Cruz&#x27;s former teammate Mike Scott had his number 33 retired at the same time. In 1999, Cruz was selected by a panel of experts as one of three outfielders on the All-Astrodome team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2018, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; determined that of players who spent at least five seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals that Cruz ranked eighteenth in all players in wins above replacement ahead of Hall of Fame players like Ted Simmons, Lou Brock, and Dizzy Dean.

After retiring from baseball, Cruz managed in both the Texas–Louisiana League and the Puerto Rican Winter League before returning as first base coach for the Astros from 1997 to 2009. He moved to the front office as a special assistant to the general manager for five years before being assigned as a Community Outreach Executive. In 2005, he agreed to coach for the team representing Puerto Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, which was managed by José Oquendo, and included his own son, José Cruz, Jr.

Jose Cruz was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on September 13, 2002 in a on-field ceremony (done prior to a game) at Minute Maid Park in Houston. He was inducted into as part of the inaugural class of the Astros Hall of Fame in August 2019.

<text>The Bucharest Metro () is an underground rapid transit system that serves Bucharest, the capital of Romania. It first opened for service on 16 November 1979. The network is run by Metrorex. One of two parts of the larger Bucharest public transport network, Metrorex had an annual ridership of 142,783,000 passengers during 2023, compared to over a billion annual passengers on Bucharest&#x27;s STB transit system. In total, the Metrorex system is long and has 64 stations.
The Bucharest Metro has five lines (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5). The newest metro line, M5, was opened in 2020. A sixth metro line, M6 line, is currently under construction. 

As of 2024, Bucharest Metro is the only metro system in Romania; with a second one, the Cluj-Napoca Metro, being under construction.

==Overview==
Bucharest Metro is part of the Bucharest public transport network which also includes STB, which operates a complex network of buses, trolleybuses, light rail and trams. STB is Bucharest&#x27;s surface public network system, while Bucharest Metro operates underground (a short stretch between Dimitrie Leonida and Tudor Arghezi metro stations is the only portion of the Bucharest Metro that does not run underground). Until relatively recently, car ownership in Romania was not common: during the first part of the 20th century few people had cars, and the subsequent communist regime installed after World War II restricted personal car use. The public transportation system in Bucharest has its origin in the 19th century, with the city introducing horse-drawn trams in 1872.

== History ==
The first proposals for a metro system in Bucharest were made in the early part of the 20th century, by the Romanian engineers Dimitrie Leonida and Elie Radu.
The earliest plans for a Bucharest Metro were drafted in the late 1930s, alongside the general plans for urban modernization of the city. The outbreak of World War II, followed by periods of political tensions culminating with the installation of communism, put an end to the plans.

By 1970, the public transport system (ITB) was no longer adequate due to the fast pace of urban development, although the system was the fourth-largest in Europe. A commission was set up, and its conclusion pointed to the necessity of an underground transit system that would become the Bucharest Metro. The plan for the first line was approved on 25 November 1974 as part of the next five-year plan and the construction on the new metro system started on 20 September 1975.

The network was not built in the same style as other Eastern European systems. Firstly, the design of the stations on the initial lines was simple, clean-cut modern, with most stations being relatively austere, without excessive additions such as mosaics, awkward lighting sources or elaborate and ornate decoration. The main function of the stations was speed of transit and practicality. Secondly, the trainsets themselves were all constructed in Romania and did not follow the Eastern European style of construction. Each station usually followed a colour theme (generally white – in Unirii 2 (Union 2), Victoriei 1 (Victory 1), Lujerului; but also light blue – in Obor, Universitate (University), and Gara de Nord (North Train Station); orange – in Tineretului (Of Youth Station); green – in Grozăvești), and an open plan. No station was made to look exactly like any other. Despite this, many stations are rather dark, due to the policies of energy economy in the late 1980s, with later modernisations doing little to fix this problem. 

During the 1980s, the metro network expanded very rapidly, at a rate only surpassed by that of the Mexico City Metro. Two more lines were opened during this decade, M3 in 1983, and M2 in 1986. 
After the 1989 Romanian Revolution, the socioeconomic and political turmoil of the 1990s largely stagnated the expansion of the metro. Advancement of the construction was difficult; for example, the Gorjului metro station was built in two stages (1994 outbound platform and 
1998 inbound platform), and as a consequence the two platforms and associated vestibules were built with different materials and with different colour schemes. The fourth metro line, M4, for which construction was started in September 1989 (shortly before the Revolution), was finally opened in 2000. After Romania joined the European Union in 2007, EU funds helped with the expansion of the metro. The M5 line was opened in 2020, and the M6 line is under construction.

Due to Bucharest being one of the largest cities in the region, the network is larger than those of Prague, Warsaw, Budapest or Sofia. Bucharest Metro is also larger than some other metro systems within the European Union, such as: Rome Metro, Copenhagen Metro, Helsinki Metro, Amsterdam Metro, Brussels Metro, and Lisbon Metro. In addition, there are plans to extend the existing lines and to open two more lines: M7 and M8. Bucharest Metro opened in 1979 (line M1), shortly after Brussels Metro (1976), Vienna U-Bahn (1976) and Amsterdam Metro (1977), and before Helsinki Metro (1982) or Copenhagen Metro (2002).

The first line, M1, opened on 19 November 1979, running from Semănătoarea &quot;(now Petrache Poenaru)&quot; to Timpuri Noi. It had a length of with 6 stations. Following this, more lines and several extensions were opened:
* 28 December 1981: M1 Timpuri Noi – Republica; , 6 stations
* 19 August 1983: M1 (now M3) Branch line Eroilor – Industriilor &quot;(now Preciziei)&quot; ; , 4 stations (Gorjului added later)
* 22 December 1984: M1 Semănătoarea &quot;(Petrache Poenaru)&quot; – Crângași; , 1 station
* 24 January 1986: M2 Piața Unirii (Union Square) – Depoul IMGB &quot;(now Berceni)&quot; ; , 6 stations (Tineretului and Constantin Brâncoveanu added later)
* 6 April 1986: M2 Tineretului; 1 infill station
* 24 October 1987: M2 Piața Unirii (Union Square) – Pipera; , 5 stations (Piața Romană = Roman Square, added later)
* 24 December 1987: M1 Crângași – Gara de Nord 1 (North Train Station 1); , 1 station (Basarab added later)
* 28 November 1988: M2 Piața Romană (Roman Square); 1 infill station
* 5 December 1988: M2 Constantin Brâncoveanu; 1 infill station
* 17 August 1989: M3 (now M1) Gara de Nord 1 (North Train Station 1) – Dristor 2; , 6 stations
* May 1991: M1 Republica – Pantelimon; , 1 station (single track, operational on a special schedule)
* 26 August 1992: M1 Basarab; 1 infill station
* 31 August 1994: M3 Gorjului; 1 infill station (westbound platform only; eastbound platform opened in 1998)
* 1 March 2000: M4 Gara de Nord 2 (North Train Station 2) – 1 Mai (First of May); , 4 stations
* 20 November 2008: M3 branch Nicolae (Nicolas) Grigorescu 2 – Linia de Centură &quot;(now Anghel Saligny)&quot;, , 4 stations
* 1 July 2011: M4 1 Mai – Parc Bazilescu, , 2 stations
* 31 March 2017: M4 Parc Bazilescu – Străulești, , 2 stations
* 15 September 2020: M5 Râul Doamnei / Valea Ialomiței – Eroilor 2 , 10 stations
* 15 November 2023: M2 Berceni – Tudor Arghezi, 1,6 kilometers (1 mi.), 1 station

Expansions in the near future (estimative):
*2027: M6 1 Mai (First of May) - Tokyo, , 6 stations
*2028: M6 Tokyo - Otopeni Airport, , 6 stations
*2030: M5 Eroilor 2 - Piața Iancului (Iancu&#x27;s Square) 2, 5,4 kilometers (2 mi.), 6 stations

Lines M1 and M3 have been sharing the section between Eroilor and Nicolae Grigorescu.

Lines M5 have been sharing the section between Romancerilor.

Lines M4 and M6 have been sharing the section between Gara de Nord 2 and 1 Mai.

The newest metro station, Tudor Arghezi (M2), was opened on 15 November 2023. Between that date and 8 May 2024, all services to Tudor Arghezi ran in a shuttle service from Berceni, because the signalling and automatisation systems were not yet finished. 

Large stations which connect with other lines, such as Piața Victoriei, have two terminals, and each terminal goes by a different name (Victoriei 1 and Victoriei 2). On the official network map, they are shown as two stations with a connection in between, even though, in fact – and for trip planners – they are a single station with platforms at different levels. There is one exception: Gara de Nord 1 and Gara de Nord 2 are separate stations (although linked through a subterranean passage, the traveller is required to exit the station proper and pay for a new fare at the other station, thus leaving the system), passengers being required to change trains at Basarab.

Generally, the underground stations feature large interiors. The largest one, Piata Unirii, is cathedral-like, with vast interior spaces, hosting retail outlets and fast-food restaurants and has an intricate network of underground corridors and passageways.

== Metrorex ==

Metrorex is the Romanian company which runs the Bucharest Metro. It is fully owned by the Romanian Government through the Ministry of Transportation. There were plans to merge the underground and overground transportation systems into one authority subordinated to the City of Bucharest, however these plans did not come to fruition.

== Infrastructure and network == 
As of 2023, the entire network runs underground, except for a stretch between Dimitrie Leonida and Tudor Arghezi stations on the southern end of the M2 line. All metro stations are underground, except two (Berceni and Tudor Arghezi, which are the former terminus and current terminus, respectively, of line M2). The network is served by six depots, two being located above ground (IMGB and Industriilor) and four underground (Ciurel, Străulești, Pantelimon and Valea Ialomiței) and smaller additional works at Gara de Nord 1, Eroilor 1, Republica, Parc Drumul Taberei, Favorit, Anghel Saligny, Crângași, Piața Victoriei 2 and Dristor 2 stations.

There are two connections between the Metro network and the Romanian Railways network, one at Berceni (connecting to the Bucharest Belt Ring), the other at Ciurel (connecting via an underground passage to the Cotroceni-Militari industrial railway). However, the latter connection is currently unused and mothballed. The metro network and the national rail network have almost similar track gauge (using the vs ) and loading gauge but not the same electrification system (the metro uses whereas the Romanian Railways use overhead lines) making it possible for new metro cars to be transported cross country as unpowered railway cars. This distinction is also seen in the pre-2007 separation between the MTR and the former KCR network in Hong Kong (see Track gauge in Hong Kong).

=== Lines ===
There are five metro lines in operation and another one in the construction phase:

*M1 Line: between Dristor and Pantelimon – the first line to open in 1979, last extension in 1990; it is circular with a North-Eastern spur. Part of its tracks are shared with M3 (7 stations).
*M2 Line: between Pipera and Tudor Arghezi. opened in 1986, last extension opened in November 2023; it runs in a north–south direction, crossing the center.
*M3 Line: between Preciziei and Anghel Saligny opened in 1983, last extension in 2008; it runs in an east–west direction, south of the center. Shares part of its tracks with M1 (7 stations).
*M4 Line: between Gara de Nord and Străulești opened in 2000, last extension was opened in 2017. Part of its tracks will be shared with M6 (4 stations).
*M5 Line: between Râul Doamnei and Eroilor opened in 2020; it runs through the Drumul Taberei neighborhood.
*M6 Line: between Gara de Nord and Henri Coandă Airport. This line is bound to be opened partially from 2026. Part of its tracks will be shared with M4 (Gara de Nord - 1 Mai).

=== Signalling system ===

There are multiple signalling systems used. Line 2, the first one that has been modernized, uses Bombardier&#x27;s CITYFLO 350 automatic train control system. It ensures the protection (ATP) and operation (ATO) of the new Bombardier Movia trains.

The system uses an IPU (Interlocking processing unit), TI21-M track circuits and EbiScreen workstations. Signals have been kept only in areas where points are present, meaning that the route has been assigned and the driver can use cab signalling.
Trains are usually operated automatically, with the driver only opening and closing the doors and supervising the operation.
Other features include auto turnback and a balise system, called PSM (precision stop marker). This ensures that the train can stop at the platform automatically.

On line 3, the ATC system has been merged with the Indusi system. Signals are present in point areas and platform ends. Along with the three red-yellow-green lights, the white ATP light has been added. Optical routes can be assigned, meaning that a train gets a green light (permission to pass the signal) only after the next signal has been passed by the train ahead, or a yellow light, meaning that the signal can be passed at low speed. Automatic block signals have been removed.

Line 4 uses Siemens&#x27;s TBS 100 FB ATC system.

Line 5 uses Alstom&#x27;s Urbalis 400 Communications-based train control system.

=== Hours of operation ===
Trains run from 5 AM to 11 PM every day. The last trains on M1, M2 and M3 wait for the transfer of the passengers between lines to complete, before leaving Piața Unirii station.

=== Headway ===
At rush hour, trains run at 4–6-minute intervals on lines 1 and 3, at 1-3 minute intervals on line 2, and at 7–8-minute on line 4; during the rest of the day, trains run at 8-minute intervals on lines 1 and 3, at 7-9 minute intervals on line 2 and at 10-minute intervals on line 4.

=== Fares and tickets ===

Public transport in Bucharest is heavily subsidized, and the subsidies will increase, as the City Council wants to reduce traffic jams, pollution and parking problems and promote public transport. Like the STB, the metro can get crowded during morning and evening rush hours. The network uses magnetic stripe cards, that are not valid for use on trams, buses or trolleys . Payment by contactless credit cards is available directly at the turnstiles. One tap will take 3 RON, the equivalent of one trip. For multiple validations with the same card, tap the plus button. Starting from 29 July 2021 Metrorex began replacing the magnetic stripe cards with contactless ones for weekly and monthly passes. As of November 2021 most of the cards with have been replaced with contactless ones.

== Future service ==
=== Under construction ===
*M6 Line: between Gara de Nord and Henri Coandă International Airport. The contract for the first part of the line, known as M6.1 between 1 Mai and Tokyo has been signed in 2022 with the Turkish company Alsim Alarko. They are tasked with designing and building the structural support of the stations and tunnels. The designing and construction contract for the second half to the Henri Coandă International Airport was signed in May 2023 with the Gülermak – Somet association.

=== Planned ===
*M2 Line: a further northbound extension of and two more stations from Pipera;
*M4 Line extension: between Gara de Nord, through &quot;Soseaua Giurgiului&quot; and ending at &quot;Gara Progresul&quot; at Bucharest&#x27; southern limit. The tender for the designing and building of this extension was launched on 26 April 2024.
*M5 Line: a further extension of to Pantelimon is approved;. The central part of M5, known as M5.2, is currently designed by Metrans Engineering and 3TI Progetti SpA.

These projects are financed by the EU, with the exception of M6.2 which is financed by a loan from JICA.

=== Other proposals ===
Metrorex is also planning the following new lines, routes and stations:
* M2 Line: a further southbound extension of and three more stations from Tudor Arghezi
* Line M7; it is supposed to run from Bragadiru to Voluntari.
* Line M8, the south half ring. Its route has not been fully planned yet, but it will run through Piața Sudului and end at Crângași and Dristor stations.
* An extension of the Line M3 is also planned for 2030.
*Two more stations are planned and may be constructed on existing lines, both on M1. However, given the complexity of work required, and the limited benefits these stations would have it is unlikely that construction will begin in the near future:
**Dorobanți between Stefan cel Mare and Piața Victoriei;
**Giulești between Crângași and Basarab.

== Rolling stock ==
The Bucharest Metro uses three types of trainsets:
* Astra IVA (BM1) – 84 trainsets (504 cars), built between 1976 and 1992. Only 15 trainsets (90 cars) are still operating. Until now, 69 trainsets (414 cars) have been retired from service. The remaining of 15 trainsets which are still active were refurbished by Metrorex and Alstom Transport România in 2011–2013. In the past, they were used on M1, M2, M3 and M4. Presently, they are still used on M4 and occasionally on M3.
* Bombardier Movia 346 (BM2, BM21) – 44 trainsets (264 cars), built between 2002 and 2008, used on M1, M2, M3 and M5 (a modification of the Swedish SL C20 metro train type)
* CAF Inneo (BM3) – 24 trainsets (144 cars), built between 2013 and 2016, used on M2.
* Alstom Metropolis (BM4) - 13 trainsets built in Taubaté between 2023 and 2025, will be used on M5 when they will finish testing.

The subway livery for Bucharest is either white with two yellow or red horizontal stripes below the window for the Astra trains, stainless steel with black and white for the Bombardier trains, or stainless steel with blue and white for the CAF trains.

All trains run on a bottom-contact , or an overhead wire (in maintenance areas where a third rail would not be safe). Maximum speed on the system is , although plans are to increase it to on M5, a new line that opened its first phase on 15 September 2020. New trains from Alstom (Metropolis) have been ordered, the first train having arrived in April 2024.

== Incidents ==

In its 45 years of operations, there have never been any very grave accidents, however, there have been various incidents, either during construction or operation. Accidents are investigated by the Railway Investigation Authority (Agenția de Investigare Feroviară Română (AGIFER)).

*1983: Due to works on M2, the Piața Unirii 1 station was flooded by the Dâmbovița.
*April–May 1986: Whilst digging for a connection service tunnel for the M1-M2 lines, the foundations and altar of the Slobozia Church were cracked, leading to the subsequent closure of the construction site of the tunnel, which was filled with sand. Thus, trains for the M2 were disconnected from the rest of the network up to 1987 (trains were sent through the Bucharest Freight Railway Bypass), when another link tunnel was created at Piața Victoriei.
*1 May 1987: During reconstruction work at Piața Unirii, the Dâmbovița was breached again, this time flooding both stations and forcing train circulation to cease for the next 5 days as a result. The flooding took place during a heavy rainstorm and during work on the Unirii Underpass (which was opened on 6 June 1987, after a record 34 days of work), when an excavator damaged a collecting canal of the Dâmbovița, flooding the underpass construction site, and subsequently, the M1 station. The M2 metro station was flooded due to an improperly sealed tube, designed for electric installations. At its peak, the flooding was 30 centimeters over the platforms, but further damages to the electrical transformers were avoided.
*2 May 1987: During recovery from the flooding at Piața Unirii the previous day, the tunnel between Timpuri Noi and Mihai Bravu was found fully submerged by the Dâmbovița, possibly in relation to the previous incident. Signalling and other electrical cables were damaged, which further prolonged the repair efforts for the previous incident.
*4 March 1996: The metro workers began a strike, demanding a 48% pay increase to offset inflation and better working conditions. It continued for at least 2 days, and was condemned by the Văcăroiu government as illegal.
*17 November 2010: An IVA train derailed between Timpuri Noi and Piața Unirii.
*14 January 2015: Due to a broken pipe, a fire started out at Tineretului station, leading to its closure for the rest of the day.
*14 June 2016: Piața Victoriei was closed after huge amounts of smoke originated from the third rail.
*20 January 2017: A fire, originating from electrical contactors, led to the evacuation of the Universitate station, subsequently leading to the closure of one of the tracks towards Piața Unirii.
*16 August 2018: A train in Piața Unirii had to be evacuated, after someone began pepper-spraying the consist stopped in the station.
*26 January 2019: A newly purchased CAF unit crashed in the Berceni depot. The train, which was stabled outside, was being shunted into the depot to prevent icing, however, due to software failure, it could not stop on time and crashed past the buffers. It is likely that the train could be scrapped since there is no way to remove it.
*26 March 2021: A sudden strike, launched by the union of the metro employees began at 5 AM, effectively blocking the circulation of all trains. The dispute is related to the activity of commercial spaces within metro stations.
*24 May 2022: 172 people were evacuated after a metro train that left from Piaţa Romană station heading to Berceni broke down.

Aside from these incidents, there have been other disruptions due to suicides at the metro. A recent one on 25 June 2019, led to the disruption of metro traffic at rush hour between Piața Unirii and Eroilor (the suicide took place at Izvor). Aside from that, in 2017, one woman was arrested for pushing a person in front of a train. These incidents led to criticism of METROREX, and suggestions to install platform screen doors or to increase security. Additionally, railfans reported harassment from security guards, being told &quot;not to photograph in the stations&quot;.

Currently, the Bucharest Metro does not use platform screen doors. Debates about the opportunity of using platform screen doors have been going on for years, and testing of such doors has been taking place at Berceni metro station, but in 2024 authorities stated that it is uncertain whether platform screen doors will be installed, given concerns about financing and costs and benefits. Since all the stations of Bucharest Metro were inaugurated without having platform screen doors, installing such doors would require retrofitting, namely the process of installing platform screen doors on a system that was not initially designed to accommodate such doors, which may be complex and difficult, especially if the type installed were to be full-height doors (rather than half-height doors or rope-doors which are more common in retrofitting, but have limited benefits compared to full height doors).

== Miscellaneous ==
Bucharest Metro was the only one in the world that operated with passengers during testing.

In the 1980s, the speed of building the network (4 kilometers / year) placed the Bucharest Metro on the second place in the world, after Mexico City Metro.

The shortest distance between two adjacent stations is between Gara de Nord 2 (M4) and Basarab 2 (M4) and is 430 meters.

<text>The spruce grouse (Canachites canadensis), also known as Canada grouse, spruce hen or fool hen, is a medium-sized grouse closely associated with the coniferous boreal forests or taiga of North America. It is the only member of the genus Canachites.

It is one of the most arboreal grouse species, fairly well adapted to perching and moving about in trees. When approached by a predator, it relies on camouflage and immobility to an amazing degree; for example, letting people approach within a few feet before finally taking flight.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747, the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of a female spruce grouse in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Brown and Spotted Heathcock&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been sent to him in London from the Hudson Bay in Canada by a Mr Light. Edwards was later sent what he assumed was a specimen of the male bird by James Isham. In 1750, he included the male bird in the third volume of his book under the English name &quot;The Black and Spotted Heathcock&quot;. When in 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the spruce grouse with other grouse in the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao canadensis&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The spruce grouse is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Canachites&quot; that was introduced in 1885 by the zoologist Leonhard Stejneger. The genus name &quot;Canachites&quot; combines the name &quot;Canace&quot; from Greek mythology with the Ancient Greek &quot;-itēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;.

In the first half of the 20th century, spruce grouse were classified as two separate species in the genus &quot;Canachites&quot;: spruce grouse (&quot;C. canadensis&quot;) and Franklin&#x27;s grouse (&quot;C. franklinii&quot;), a position reinstated by Birdlife International in 2014. However, as of early 2021, the International Ornithological Congress (IOC), the American Ornithological Society, and the Clements taxonomy retain Franklin&#x27;s grouse as a subspecies of spruce grouse.

The species was later moved to the genus &quot;Dendragapus&quot;, congeneric with the blue grouse with which spruce grouse often share coniferous habitats. However, spruce grouse do not have inflatable cervical sacs as in blue grouse, and the natal plumage of the two species is different. Based on its stronger resemblance to the Siberian grouse (&quot;Falcipennis falcipennis&quot;), the spruce grouse was later reclassified into the genus &quot;Falcipennis&quot;. However, taxonomic studies found this classification to be paraphyletic, with the Siberian grouse being basal to a clade containing the spruce grouse, &quot;Tetrao&quot;, and &quot;Lyrurus&quot;. Due to this, the spruce grouse was again reclassified in &quot;Canachites&quot;, bringing its taxonomy full-circle.

The spruce grouse has six recognized subspecies:
==Description==
Spruce grouse are long; males weigh and females . The spruce grouse has a wingspan range of 21.5-22.6 in (54.5-57.5 cm). Races vary slightly in plumage, especially in the tail pattern and in the extent of white on the underparts, but in general adult males are mainly grey above and black below, with white spots along the side, and a red patch of bare skin over the eye called the &quot;eyebrow comb&quot;. This red eyebrow comb, should not be confused by a similar yellow marking found on other species of grouse including, but not limited to, sharp-tailed and dusky grouse. Adult females are mottled brown (red morph) or mottled grey (grey morph) with dark and white bars on the underparts. Juveniles resemble females. Females may be confused with ruffed grouse but they have a dark tail with a pale band at the end (while the reverse is true in ruffed grouse) and they do not erect their crown feathers when alarmed the way ruffed grouse do.

Spruce grouse are among the most silent of all grouse, but they nevertheless have a number of calls used to warn of predators, to repel territorial intruders, to maintain brood cohesion, or to elicit brooding. In the subspecies &quot;franklinii&quot;, territorial males are notable for their wing-clap display. At the end of a short flight through the trees, the wings are brought together over the back so as to produce two sharp claps, about 0.5 s apart, loud enough to be heard by the human ear 150 m away. These territorial displays can sometimes be elicited by similar hand clapping, and can be used to detect male territories and estimate their density. Other non-vocal sounds include soft drumming by territorial males (a sound produced by the beating wings) and a tail-swish and a whoosh produced by the tail feathers in flight.

==Distribution and habitat==
As a specialist of the taiga, the spruce grouse is found throughout Canada. In the United States, it is present in Alaska, northern New England, the Adirondacks in New York, northern Michigan, northeastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and the montane coniferous forests of Montana, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, and Washington. Spruce grouse are always associated with conifer-dominated forests, be they pine, spruce, or fir. They seem to prefer young successional stands. In summer they can be found near rich understory of blueberries and other shrub, and in winter they prefer denser stands.

The spruce grouse is essentially a permanent resident. However, in southwestern Alberta up to 35% of females and 7% of males move several kilometers (up to 11) between summer breeding sites and wintering sites. Similar movements have also been documented in Alaska and New Brunswick (Canada).

==Behaviour and ecology==

This species prefers to walk on the ground or along tree limbs rather than fly. Like other grouse, in the fall they grow &quot;snow shoes&quot; (short lateral extensions, or pectinations) on their toes. This increases the surface area of the toes and helps support the bird on snow and probably to grip branches as well. The pectinations are shed in the spring.
Flights are usually over short distances, most commonly from the ground to a tree nearby, or vice versa. Flight can be rapid but no actual measures of velocity have been made.

==Breeding==
Males are promiscuous; they disperse and advertise a territory that is visited by females for mating. Females are solely responsible for the rest of the reproductive effort though males have been known to stay with young chicks and seem to aid in keeping the brood together. For a nest, they scratch a depression in the ground in a bush or under a low-lying coniferous branch or fallen tree, away from other females and from the males&#x27; territories. The nest is lined with grasses, leaves, and a few feathers. Nesting season is from early May to early July. Up to 10 eggs may be laid, the usual number being 4–7. Laying rate is 1 egg every 1.4 days. Eggs are about and are tawny olive or buff, marked with blotches of brown. Incubation begins with the last egg laid and lasts about 24 days. Young are about 15 g at hatching (0.5 ounces) and they are precocial; they walk out of the nest as soon as they are dry (about 8 h after hatching). They are capable of fluttering up from the ground at 1 week of age. The brood stays together and is accompanied by the hen, who broods them all night and frequently during the day until the young are 3–5 weeks old. Brooding behaviour of the female seems to be initiated by specific calls from the chicks when they are cold. At 70–100 days of age, chicks tend to leave the group and become independent.
Females breed only once a year. Most females first breed at 1 year of age, but about half the males delay establishing a territory until 2 years. The species&#x27; lifespan appears to be about 5–6 years in the wild, though one study in Southwestern Alberta has found two males and one female that lived to be at least 13 years old.

===Food and feeding===
The staple winter food is conifer needles, clipped directly from the tree, preferably the midcrown of pines though other conifers such as spruce are exploited as well. Spruce needles are high in calcium and their increase in use by females in Spring may be related to egg production In summer the birds can forage on the ground, eating berries, green plants such as blueberry leaves, fungi, and some insects. In winter, when only needles are consumed, the caeca (dead-end extensions of the intestines) and ventriculus (gizzard) increase in size to support digestion. The crop is also well developed: up to 45 cc of needles (about 10% of body mass) can be stored in the crop at the end of the day, to be digested over the duration of the night fast. Like other birds, spruce grouse consume clay, grit or small stones to help their gizzard break down food. Chicks under 1 week old feed on insects and other arthropods, then switch to berries and fungi until the fall, when they start feeding on needles. Birds captured while on the winter diet have been maintained several months without loss of weight, on only pine needles and grit and clay taken from where they were seen consuming it.

==Predators==
Spruce grouse eggs are taken by American red squirrels, gray foxes, weasels, and possibly corvids. Adults can fall prey to various hawks and owls, red foxes, American and Pacific martens, wolves, cougars, and coyotes.

==Relationship with humans==
This species is commonly hunted. Annual bag figures in the late 1970s were about 188,000 birds in the US and about 360,000 in Canada. Even though it has been deemed of Least Concern by IUCN, in the United States this bird is a protected species according to many northern states&#x27; hunting rules. The spruce grouse is available for hunting in Alaska from August 10 - March 31 and in some regions through May 15 according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
Conversely, the spruce grouse is considered threatened in its southern range - being listed as Endangered in New York and Vermont, and &quot;Critically Imperiled&quot; in Wisconsin according to NatureServe. In New York, the population is estimated at 175–315 individuals, with declines recorded since the 1970s. However, a management plan has been developed.

<text>Hans Island (Inuktitut and , ; Inuktitut syllabics: ; , ; , ) is an island in the centre of the Kennedy Channel of Nares Strait in the high Arctic region, split between the Canadian territory of Nunavut and the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland. The island itself is barren and uninhabited with an area of , measuring , and a maximum elevation of . Its location in the strait that separates Ellesmere Island of Canada from northern Greenland was for years a border dispute, the so-called Whisky War between the two countries of Canada and Denmark. Hans Island is the smallest of three islands in Kennedy Channel off the Washington Land coast; the others are Franklin Island and Crozier Island. The strait at this point is wide, placing the island within the territorial waters of both Canada and Denmark (Greenland). A shared border traverses the island.

The island has likely been part of Inuit hunting grounds since the 14th century. It was claimed by both Canada and Denmark until 14 June 2022, when both countries agreed to split the disputed island roughly in half. In accordance with the Greenland home rule treaty, Denmark handles certain foreign affairs, such as border disputes, on behalf of the entire Danish Realm.

==Geology==
As determined by field investigations and the interpretation of satellite image maps and monochrome stereoscopic air photographs, the exposed portion of Hans Island consists of of Silurian limestone. From its summit to sea level, it consists of an upper thick yellowish brown to grey megalodont bivalve and stromatoporoid limestone; a thick pale yellowish brown to pale grey marker bed; and a thick yellowish brown to brownish grey weathering, locally cliff-forming, coral, megalodont bivalve and stromatoporoid limestone. These strata are assigned to the uppermost carbonate buildup facies of the Allen Bay Formation of Canada and part of the Kap Morton Formation of Washington Land, Greenland.
The limestone of Hans Island are underlain by Lower Cambrian to middle Silurian strata that are at least thick. These sedimentary strata underlying Washington Land, Hans Island and most of subsurface Kennedy Channel are undeformed with a northwesterly dip of 1 to 3 degrees. They contain source rocks that may have been heated enough to have generated significant amounts of oil and gas. However, these strata lack the geological structures and facies changes capable of trapping these hydrocarbons and forming commercial-size petroleum reservoirs.

The glaciated surface of Hans Island is covered by a veneer of unconsolidated glacial sediment. These sediments consist of a mixture of gravel, mud and boulders that form a discontinuous till veneer on its limestone surface over much of the island with the exception of its coastal cliffs and part of the intertidal zone. The gravel consists of angular to subrounded (kidney-shaped) limestone clasts and large erratics of red granites and granitoid and garnet gneisses.

This surface also exhibits erosional features indicative of the streaming of an ice sheet through Kennedy Channel. These glacial features include glacial striations on bedrock; glacially-polished bedrock; linear-aligned crescentic fractures; sickle-shaped, comma-form, and longitudinal grooves and furrows. In addition, linear glacial flutes and ridges can be mapped from aerial photography and profile of the island also has a stream-lined form suggestive of glacial sculpting.

== Etymology ==
The island is named after Hans Hendrik, whose native Greenlandic name was . Hendrik was an Arctic traveller and translator who worked on the American and British Arctic expeditions of Elisha Kent Kane, Charles Francis Hall, Isaac Israel Hayes and George Strong Nares, from 1853 to 1876.

Prior to 2005, the island was thought to have been named during Charles Francis Hall&#x27;s third Arctic voyage, the Polaris expedition, between 1871 and 1873. The first written reference to the name and the island itself appears in Charles Henry Davis&#x27;s book &quot;Narrative of the North Polar expedition&quot; (1876), which is a narrative of Hall&#x27;s fatal North Pole expedition. On page 407 it appears, without any previous mention. The island made its first cartographic appearance on a map accompanying the book.

Charles Henry Davis writes,

He was referring to the ship &quot;Polaris&quot;&#x27;s return voyage southward down the Kennedy channel. This does not answer when it was named. The ship&#x27;s doctor and leader of the scientific part of the expedition, Emil Bessels, mentioned the island in his own book, (1879). He tells that on 29 August 1871, on the voyage north through Kennedy Channel, the &quot;Polaris&quot; sailed between (Ellesmere Island) and a small island &quot;which was named Hans Island&quot; (), without further explanation of the name.

An earlier mention of a Hans Island expedition is in Elisha Kent Kane&#x27;s account of the Second Grinnell expedition, &quot;Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition, 1853, ’54, ’55&quot;, (published 1857), in pages 317–319. Thus the year 1853 is now often cited as the date of the discovery and naming of the island, including in a letter by the Danish Ambassador to Canada in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; on 28 July 2005.

Littleton Island () is approximately from Greenland&#x27;s coast right in Smith Sound. It is about south of the island today called Hans Island. Around it and the coast of Greenland lay dozens of tiny islands, and Kane named one of them Hans Island after Hans Hendrik, the native Greenlandic helper he had with him on the trip. That this is the current Littleton Island is confirmed by Kane mentioning Edward Augustus Inglefield, who named Littleton Island.

The names of many places in this region have changed or been altered during the last 100 years. For example, the name of Nares Strait (named after George Strong Nares), separating Ellesmere Island and northern Greenland, was not agreed upon between the Danish and Canadian governments until 1964.

==History and disputed sovereignty==
The conflict over the island, known as the Whisky War, has been alternately described as &quot;one of the most passive-aggressive boundary disputes in history&quot; and &quot;the friendliest war.&quot;

===Early history===
Inuit living in northern Greenland or Canada would have known the island for centuries. In the mid 19th century, Nares Strait was likely unknown to Europeans. It is not known whether Norsemen visited the island in the centuries when Greenland was inhabited by them.

From 1850 to 1880, the area in which Hans Island is situated was explored by American and British expeditions. These expeditions were a response partly due to the popular search for the missing British explorer John Franklin, and partly to search for the elusive Northwest Passage and/or reach the North Pole.

The Danish &quot;Celebration Expedition&quot; of 1920 to 1923 accurately mapped the whole region of the northern Greenland coast from Cape York (, ) to Danmark Fjord ().

In 1933, the Permanent Court of International Justice declared the legal status of Greenland in favour of Denmark. Denmark claims geological evidence points to Hans Island being part of Greenland, and therefore it belongs to Denmark by extension of the Court&#x27;s ruling.

Since the 1960s, numerous surveys have been undertaken in the Nares Strait region, including seismic, ice flow, mapping, archaeological and economic surveys. Canadian-based Dome Petroleum made surveys on and around Hans Island from 1980 to 1983, to investigate the movement of ice masses.

===1972–73 border treaty===
In 1972, a team consisting of personnel from the Canadian Hydrographic Service and Danish personnel working in the Nares Strait determined the geographic coordinates for Hans Island. During negotiations between Canada and Denmark on their maritime boundary in 1973, both states claimed Hans Island was part of their territory. No agreement was reached between the two governments on the issue.

The maritime boundary immediately north and south of Hans Island was established in the continental shelf treaty ratified by Denmark and Canada and then submitted to the United Nations on 17 December 1973, in force since 13 March 1974. At the time, it was the longest shelf boundary treaty ever negotiated and may have been the first ever continental shelf boundary developed by a computer.

The treaty lists 127 points (latitude and longitude) from Davis Strait to the end of Robeson Channel, where the Nares Strait runs into the Lincoln Sea, to draw geodesic lines between, to form the border. The treaty does not, however, draw a line from point 122 () to point 123 (), a distance of , because Hans Island is situated in between those two points.

=== Joint administration ===
In 1984, Iqaluit-based Kenn Harper, a historian and writer for &quot;Nunatsiaq News&quot;, wrote an article about Hans Island. It was printed in &quot;Hainang&quot;, a local newspaper in Qaanaaq in northwestern Greenland. This article was picked up by a Danish newspaper in Copenhagen and by CBC Radio in Canada.

This article was sparked because of a chance encounter on the ice near Resolute, in the Canadian Arctic in the autumn of 1983. According to Harper, he met a man wearing a hat with bold capitals around the side of the hat saying &quot;Hans Island, N.W.T.&quot; This man was a scientist with Dome Petroleum who had just spent the summer on the island doing ice research. Dome Petroleum did research on and around the island from 1980 to 1983.

Simultaneously, the Danish and Canadian governments were in the process of signing a cooperation agreement in relation to the marine environment in the Nares Strait. The agreement was signed and put into force on 26 August 1983. The Agreement addresses protection of the marine environment of the waters lying between Canada and Greenland, particularly with respect to preparedness measures as a contingency against pollution incidents resulting from offshore hydrocarbon exploration or exploitation and from shipping activities that may affect the marine environment.

One of the items also discussed was the possibility of establishing a reciprocal arrangement for processing applications to conduct research on and around Hans Island. This was never signed; however, Canadian John Munro, at the time Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and Dane Tom Høyem, at the time Minister for Greenland, agreed, in common interest, to avoid acts that might prejudice future negotiations.

However, unknown to the politicians, Dome Petroleum was doing research on the island.

In 1984, the Danish Minister for Greenland planted the Danish flag on the island and left a little message saying &quot; (). It is also said he left a bottle of brandy; however, this seems to have been Schnapps, which, unlike brandy, is a traditional Danish spirit. It is commonly told, internally in the Royal Danish Navy, that it was specifically a bottle of Gammel Dansk, which translates literally to &#x27;Old Danish&#x27;. The Canadians have reciprocated with their own sign, the flag of Canada and a bottle of Canadian Club.

===Media attention and continuing negotiations===

Though CBC and others had done some reporting in the 1980s, the dispute came to popular attention through Canadian press stories during late March 2004. Within days, it spread to other newspapers worldwide.

On 25 March 2004, when Adrian Humphreys of the Canadian &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper wrote an article entitled &quot;Five-year plan to &#x27;put footprints in the snow&#x27; and assert northern sovereignty&quot;, Humphreys made a brief mention of the dispute over Hans Island, and that the Danes had sent warships to the island.

The Arctic sea region has long been a subject of dispute. In this matter, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Russia, and Norway share an interest in establishing parts of the Arctic seas as &quot;national waters&quot;. The United States and most European Union countries, on the other hand, officially regard the region as international waters. Further items in the Canadian media led to the issue being picked up by international news organizations.

The 2004 Canadian budget was introduced on 23 March 2004, by the government of Canada, two days before the issue gained widespread attention. It proposed minimal increases to spending on national defence. The issue of Hans Island was raised in the Canadian Parliament by opposition foreign affairs critic Stockwell Day to highlight the government&#x27;s failure to provide more funding for the military.

A news article by Adrian Humphreys on 30 March 2004, also in the &quot;National Post&quot;, entitled &quot;Danes summon envoy over Arctic fight—the solution of the dispute is not going to be military&quot;, drew even more attention to the issue. The article claimed Brian Herman, Canada&#x27;s only diplomat in Denmark (ambassador Alfonso Gagliano having been recently recalled as a result of an unrelated Canadian scandal), was called before the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comment about his country&#x27;s intentions in the dispute, which had, according to the article, recently been inflamed by Danish sailors occupying Hans Island.

On 31 March 2004, the Danish and Canadian governments denied Herman or any other Canadian official was summoned to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Both governments stated the dispute was a long-standing issue, and nothing had changed in the matter.

A Canadian military exercise, named &quot;Narwhal 04&quot;, inflamed the issue further. However, this exercise had been in the planning stage since September 2003, and it took place around Pangnirtung on Baffin Island, south of Hans Island. The Canadian military denied the exercise had anything to do with the Danish–Canadian territorial dispute. The exercise took place from 9 to 30 August 2004, involving about 160 soldiers from the army, various aircraft, helicopters and one frigate, . About 600 Canadian Forces personnel were involved in total.

A new development came to light after Canadian Defence Minister Bill Graham visited the island on 20 July 2005. Peter Taksøe-Jensen, the head of the international law department at Denmark&#x27;s foreign ministry, said the following in an interview with Reuters on 25 July in response to the event:

On 18 August 2005, Canadian frigate left Halifax, Nova Scotia, for an Arctic cruise. Canadian officials said the month-long patrol was unrelated to the Hans Island dispute. The s and were also scheduled to patrol the Arctic in 2005.

In July 2007, owing to updated satellite imagery, Canadian authorities realized the line constructed as a basis for the maritime boundary (but not for land) would have run roughly across the middle of the island, but the boundary did not &quot;move&quot; as that required a bilateral agreement by the two states for which negotiations continued.

The two countries maintained a sense of humour in the dispute. Peter Taksøe-Jensen has stated &quot;when Danish military go there, they leave a bottle of schnapps. And when Canadian military forces come there, they leave a bottle of Canadian Club and a sign saying, &#x27;Welcome to Canada.&#x27;&quot;

Negotiations began in 2012 between Canada and Denmark, calling for either a condominium or splitting the disputed island&#x27;s sovereignty in half.

On 23 May 2018, Canada and Denmark announced the creation of a Joint Task Force to determine the boundary between Canada and Greenland, including the fate of Hans Island.

====Google fight====
&quot;Google fight&quot; or &quot;Google war&quot; is the name given to a number of advertisements on the Internet search engine Google which promoted either Danish or Canadian sovereignty over Hans Island in 2005.

In July 2005, a Canadian author said that he saw an advertisement on Google stating that the island was part of Denmark, along with a link to a Danish Foreign Ministry page with a copy of the diplomatic protest that had been sent after Canada&#x27;s defence minister had visited the island. Denmark&#x27;s ambassador to Canada said that the Danish government had not been involved in any advertisement about the island and whoever placed it was acting alone. In response, the Canadian author ordered his own advertisement stating that the island belongs to Canada, along with a link to a page with a rotating Canadian flag and the Canadian national anthem. Similar to the actual dispute, the &quot;Google fight&quot; was considered quite harmless and treated as entertainment by the media, with the Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry responding that they – as a goodwill gesture to Denmark – still would allow Danish pastries to be sold in the ministry cafeteria.

===Resolution===
&lt;mapframe text=&quot;The international border on Hans Island after the 2022 treaty. The balance is 40% Canada (western portion) and 60% Greenland/Denmark (eastern portion).&quot; latitude=&quot;80.826389&quot; longitude=&quot;-66.458333&quot; zoom=&quot;12&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
On 11 June 2022, the Danish, Greenlandic, Canadian, and Nunavut governments agreed to split Hans Island in half after 17 years of negotiations. On 14 June 2022, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Danish foreign affairs minister Jeppe Kofod, and prime minister of Greenland Múte Bourup Egede signed an agreement to divide the island nearly in half along a natural fault line. The treaty will take effect after the Folketing (Parliament of Denmark), the Inatsisartut (Parliament of Greenland) have each voted to ratify it. By this, Canada and the Danish Realm, through Greenland, will have an international land border of , which follows a rift, forming a half circle with the westernmost part around the middle, in the surface of the island that runs from north to south near the centre of the island. The agreement was cited as an example of a peaceful resolution to a border conflict shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The island contains the third shortest land border between countries, and also a second land neighbour for Canada and for the Danish Realm, each of which had only one, with the United States and Germany respectively. It also is the northernmost international land border in the world, as well as the third land border between countries of Europe and of the Americas, the previous two being between French Guiana and the South American countries Brazil and Suriname.

===The new border according to the treaty and laws===
The Danish law to establish the land border and the sea border between the Danish Realm and Canada was put before the Danish parliament on 5 October 2023. The final Danish parliament decision came 19 December 2023. The comments to the law contains (point 1.3) a principle to allow people who enter Hans Island for official matters or tourism to visit the entire island without border control. No border control will be established on Hans Island.

The treaty (written in English, French, Danish and Greenlandic) mentions three border points on land, and 149 border points in the sea, with straight lines in between. The land points are:
*Point T1: 80° 49′ 17.2″ N 66° 27′ 02.4″ W
*Point T2: 80° 49′ 33.1″ N 66° 27′ 52.3″ W
*Point T3: 80° 49′ 54.6″ N 66° 27′ 24.0″ W

<text>The Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh ( BJS or JS, short name: Jan Sangh) was a Hindutva political party active in India. It was established on 21 October 1951 in Delhi by three founding members: Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Balraj Madhok and Deendayal Upadhyaya. Jan Sangh was the political arm of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindutva volunteer organisation. In 1977, it merged with several other left, centre and right parties opposed to the Indian National Congress and formed the Janata Party. In 1980, the members of erstwhile Jan Sangh quit the Janata party after the defeat in the 1980 general elections and formed the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is the direct political successor to the Jan Sangh.

==Origins==
Many members of the right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) began to contemplate the formation of a political party to continue their work, begun in the days of the British Raj, and take their ideology further. Around the same time, Syama Prasad Mukherjee left the Hindu Mahasabha political party that he had once led because of a disagreement with that party over permitting non-Hindu membership.
&lt;br&gt;Mainly two reasons led to the formation of Jan Sangh- first was the Liaquat–Nehru Pact and second, the ban on RSS after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.
&lt;br&gt;The state level units for Punjab, P.E.P.S.U. (Patiala and East Punjab States Union), Delhi, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Bharat were already established before it was formally founded at national level.
The BJS was subsequently started by Mukherjee on 21 October 1951 in Delhi, with the collaboration of the R.S.S., as a &quot;nationalistic alternative&quot; to the Congress Party.

==History==

The first plenary session of Jan Sangh was held at Kanpur in December 1952.

After the death of Mukherjee in 1953, RSS activists in the BJS edged out the career politicians and made it a political arm of the RSS and an integral part of the RSS family of organisations (&quot;Sangh Parivar&quot;).

The strongest election performance of the BJS came in the 1967 Lok Sabha election in which it won 35 seats, when the Congress majority was its thinnest ever.&lt;br&gt;
The party secured six out of seven parliamentary seats in Delhi and went on to wrest control of the Metropolitan Council and Municipal corporation.

==Ideology==
When BJS was formed, an 8-point programme was adopted.This formed the core of its ideology over the next years.

The BJS leadership fervently supported a strong policy against Pakistan and China, and were averse to communism and the Soviet Union. Many BJS leaders also initiated the drive to ban cow slaughter nationwide in the early 1960s.&lt;br&gt;
Establishment of full relations with Israel was also a demand in the party manifesto.&lt;br&gt;
Uniform Civil Code was mentioned in the 1967 manifesto which said that the party would enact UCC if it came to power.

==Chronological list of presidents==
== In general elections ==
The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was created in 1951, and the first general election it contested was in 1951–52, in which it won only three Lok Sabha seats, in line with the four seats won by Hindu Mahasabha and three seats won by Ram Rajya Parishad. Syama Prasad Mukherjee and Durga Charan Banerjee were elected from Calcutta South East constituency and Midnapore Jhargram constituency in West Bengal and Uma Shankar Trivedi from Chittor constituency in Rajasthan. All the like-minded parties formed a block in the Parliament, led by Shyama Prasad Mookerjee.

<text>Gerard Colby (earlier known as Gerard Colby Zilg) (born 1950) is an author and past president of the US National Writers Union, where he previously held various chair positions. From 1997 to 2001 he served as chair of the Vermont section.

He is notable for authoring &quot;Du Pont: Behind The Nylon Curtain&quot;. The 1974 publication was put under contract by Prentice-Hall in anticipation of a significant quantity of books sold to Book of the Month. The book painted a portrait of DuPont enterprises and the DuPont family that was characterized as &quot;sober but unflattering&quot; by some but as presenting a Marxist interpretation of the company by others. In response to pressure from DuPont, Book-of-the-Month cancelled its preorder. In anticipation of lower sales, Prentice-Hall reduced its print run and scaled back its marketing plans. Colby (Zilg) sued Prentice-Hall for breach of contract. In the federal case Zilg v Prentice-Hall, Inc., the Federal District Court in New York awarded Colby damages of $24,000. In 1984 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the ruling. The US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal the same year. The suit is an important example of case law relating to the practice of &quot;privishing&quot; (private publishing) where a publishing house reduces its print run and support of a book so much that the book fails to reach the public.

==State Politics==
Colby ran for the Vermont State Senate seat for Lamoille County in 2012 and 2016 but lost both races.

<doc id="327559" wikidata="Q19058" url="?curid=327559" title="Ruffed grouse">
<text>The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) is a medium-sized grouse occurring in forests from the Appalachian Mountains across Canada to Alaska. It is the most widely distributed game bird in North America. It is non-migratory. It is the only species in the genus Bonasa.

The ruffed grouse is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a &quot;partridge&quot;, an unrelated phasianid, and occasionally confused with the grey partridge, a bird of open areas rather than woodlands.

The ruffed grouse is the state game bird of Pennsylvania, United States.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1766 12th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He classified it as &quot;Tetrao umbellus&quot;, placing it in a subfamily with Eurasian grouse. The genus &quot;Bonasa&quot; was applied by British naturalist John Francis Stephens in 1819. Ruffed grouse is the preferred common name because it applies only to this species. Misleading vernacular names abound, however, and it is often called partridge (sometimes rendered pa&#x27;tridge, or shortened to pat), pheasant, or prairie chicken, all of which are properly applied to other birds. Other nicknames for ruffed grouse include drummer or thunder-chicken.

The ruffed grouse has 13 recognized subspecies:

* &quot;B. u. brunnescens&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. castanea&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. incana&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. labradorensis&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. mediana&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. monticola&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. obscura&quot; 
* &quot;B. u. phaios&quot; (
* &quot;B. u. sabini&quot; 
* &quot;B. u. togata&quot; 
* &quot;B. u. umbelloides&quot; 
* &quot;B. u. umbellus&quot; 

* &quot;B. u. yukonensis&quot; 

==Description==

Ruffed grouse are chunky, medium-sized birds that weigh from , measure from in length and span across their short, strong wings. They have two distinct morphs: grey and brown. In the grey morph, the head, neck, and back are grey-brown; the breast is light with barring. There is much white on the underside and flanks. Overall, the birds have a variegated appearance; the throat is often distinctly lighter. The tail is essentially the same brownish grey, with regular barring and a broad black band near the end (&quot;subterminal&quot;). Brown-morph birds have tails of the same color and pattern. However, the rest of the plumage is much more brown, giving the appearance of a more uniform bird with less light plumage below and a conspicuously grey tail. There are all sorts of intergrades between the most typical morphs; warmer and more humid conditions favor browner birds in general.
The ruffs are on the sides of the neck in both sexes. They also have a crest on top of their head, which sometimes lies flat. Both sexes are similarly marked and sized, making them difficult to tell apart, even in hand. The female often has a broken subterminal tail band. At the same time, males tend to have unbroken tail bands, though the opposite of either can occur. Females may also do a display similar to the male. Another fairly accurate sign is that rump feathers with a single white dot indicate a female; rump feathers with more than one white dot indicate a male.

The average life span of a ruffed grouse is one year, although some birds are thought to live for as long as eleven years. Ruffed grouse are polygynous, and males may mate with several females during the breeding season.

==Ecology==
Like most grouse, they spend most of their time on the ground; mixed woodland rich in aspen seems to be particularly well-liked. These birds forage on the ground or in trees. They are omnivores, eating buds, leaves, berries, seeds, and insects. According to nature writer Don L. Johnson:
==Hunting==

Ruffed grouse frequently seek gravel and clover along road beds during early morning and late afternoon. These are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds. Also, grouse use sandy roadbeds to dust their feathers to rid themselves of skin pests. Dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers. Birds will return to these spots during the late afternoon to bathe in dust and socialize and mate.

==Behavior==
The ruffed grouse differs from other grouse species in its courtship display. The ruffed grouse relies entirely on a non-vocal acoustic display, known as drumming, unlike other grouse species. The drumming itself is a rapid, wing-beating display that creates a low-frequency sound, starting slow and speeding up (thump ... thump ... thump..thump-thump-thump-thump). Even in thick woods, this can be heard for or more.

The ruffed grouse spends most of its time quietly on the ground, and when surprised, may explode into flight, beating its wings very loudly. They will burrow into the snow for warmth in the winter and may suddenly burst out of the snow when approached too closely.

The male grouse proclaims his property by engaging in a &quot;drumming&quot; display. This sound is made by beating his wings against the air to create a vacuum. It usually stands on a log, stone or mound of dirt when drumming. It does not strike the log to make the noise, it only uses the &quot;drumming log&quot; as a sort of stage.

The ruffed grouse population has a cycle, and follows the cycle no matter how much or how little hunting there is. The cycle has puzzled scientists for years, and is simply referred to as the &quot;grouse cycle&quot;. In spite of this historical cycle, populations have been declining in Pennsylvania and management plans adopted. Habitat loss has been a concern for the species, but the introduction of the West Nile virus has been seen to be further increasing mortality.

<text>Versatile Real-Time Executive (VRTX) is a real-time operating system (RTOS) developed and marketed by the company Mentor Graphics. VRTX is suitable for both traditional board-based embedded systems and system on a chip (SoC) architectures. It has been superseded by the Nucleus RTOS.

==History==
The VRTX operating system began as a product of Hunter &amp; Ready, a company founded by James Ready and Colin Hunter in 1980 which later became Ready Systems. This firm later merged with Microtec Research in 1993, and went public in 1994. This firm was then acquired by Mentor Graphics in 1995 and VRTX became a Mentor product.

The VRTX operating system was released in September 1981.

Since the 1980s, the chief rival to VRTX has been VxWorks, a Wind River Systems product. VxWorks had its start in the mid 1980s as compiler and assembly language tools to supplement VRTX, named VRTX works, or VxWorks. Later, Wind River created their own real-time kernel offering similar to VRTX.

==VRTX==
VRTX comes in several flavors: 
* VRTX: 16-bit VRTX, for Z8000, 8086, etc.
* VRTX-32: 32-bit VRTX, for M68K, AMD29K, etc.
* MPV: Multiprocessor VRTX for distributed applications, such as distributed across VME backplanes.
* VRTX-mc: Micro-Controller VRTX, for small systems needing minimal memory use.
* VRTX-oc: On-chip VRTX, freeware community source code for personal and academic use, license required for commercial use.
* VRTX-sa: Scalable Architecture VRTX for full operating system features. Loosely based on Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Mach microkernel principles.
* SPECTRA: Virtual machine (VM) implementation for running a VRTX VM on Unix-like hosts. Also includes an open integrated development environment allowing third-party tools open access to cross-development resources.

Most companies developing software with VRTX use reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors including ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, or others.

==Implementations==
VRTX runs the Hubble Space Telescope.

VRTX runs the Wide Area Augmentation System.

VRTX was the first operating system ported to the AMD Am29000.

VRTX is used as a core for the Motorola proprietary operating system, which runs on most company devices since the Motorola V60 and T280i, up to the Motorola RAZR2 V9x. It runs on several hardware platforms including LTE (Motorola V300, V500, V600, E398, RAZR V3 and others featuring the ARM7 processor), LTE2 (Motorola L7 and upcoming devices with 176x220 screen resolution), Rainbow POG (3G phones featuring an MCORE processor from Motorola E1000 to RAZR V3x), Argon (all new 3G phones with 532 MHz ARM11 processor since Motorola RAZR MAXX V6, and V3xx), and others.

<doc id="327568" wikidata="Q271114" url="?curid=327568" title="Amina Lawal">
<text>Amina Lawal Kurami (born 1972) is a Nigerian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and for conceiving a child out of wedlock. Lawal was sentenced by an Islamic Sharia court in Funtua, in the northern state of Katsina, in Nigeria, on 22 March 2002. The person she identified as the father of the child, Yahayya Muhammad Kurami, was acquitted of the accusation of zinā. Although Kurami was excused because he took an oath by the Holy Qur’an, this was not an option for Lawal due to the presence of her child, which is proof in the Mālikī school.

Lawal&#x27;s conviction sparked an international controversy. It was overturned by a Sharia which ruled that it violated Islamic law, and she later remarried.

==Background==

Lawal was the second Nigerian woman condemned to death by stoning for engaging in sex before marriage. The first woman, Safiya Hussaini, had her sentence overturned in March 2002 on her first appeal. Sharia law was established in northern Nigeria&#x27;s mostly Muslim state Zamfara in 2000 and has since spread to at least twelve other states.

==Appeals and acquittal==
An appeal was put in motion and on 25 September 2003 Lawal&#x27;s sentence of death by stoning for adultery was overturned by a five-judge panel of Katsina State Sharia Court of Appeal. Four of the five judges ruled that the conviction violated Islamic law on a number of points, which included: the defendant&#x27;s right to proper legal defence was not ensured, the circumstantial evidence of her pregnancy was not sufficient, the confession of the accused was not valid, and only one instead of the required three judges was present at the time of conviction.

Baobab for Women&#x27;s Human Rights, an NGO based in Nigeria, took up her case which was argued by Nigerian lawyers trained in both secular and Sharia law. Lawal&#x27;s lawyers included Hauwa Ibrahim, a prominent human rights lawyer known for her pro bono work for people condemned under Sharia law. In their successful defence of Amina Lawal, lawyers used the notion of &quot;extended pregnancy&quot; (dormant foetus), arguing that under Sharia law, a five-year interval is possible between human conception and birth; two years prior to the date of her daughter&#x27;s birth, she was still married to her husband.

== Reactions ==
The affair exposed civil and religious tensions between the Christian and Muslim regions of Nigeria. The sentence also caused widespread outrage in the West, and a number of campaigns were launched to persuade the Nigerian government to overturn the sentence. Several contestants of the Miss World beauty contest, to be held in Nigeria in 2002, pulled out of the contest to protest against Amina Lawal&#x27;s treatment. Miss Norway condemned the sentence and called it “utterly revolting” and stated she would not attend until Lawal was acquitted. Miss Ivory Coast said, “[I am] not going to Nigeria, and I hope my decision will help save Amina Lawal.” Miss Togo added, “Stoning this woman is not right. All of society should rise up to end this sort of practice.” Several other beauty queens representing different countries also criticised the sentence and refused to compete. &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; had a special report on Amina Lawal and encouraged viewers to send protest e-mails to the Nigerian Ambassador to the United States: over 1.2 million e-mails ensued.

Amnesty International had a solid response to the sentencing because Nigeria is a signatory of the legally binding international human rights Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The organization also implored Nigeria to bring Sharia law in line with the 1999 Nigerian Constitution. However, Amnesty was unaware that this debate already existed in the religiously separated Nigeria.

United States President Bill Clinton pleaded to the Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, “I hope and pray that the legal system will find a way to pardon a young woman convicted to death for bearing a child out of wedlock.” Consequently, Clinton was pleading to the wrong audience as President Obasanjo is a Christian from the south of Nigeria and most likely opposes this sentencing more vehemently. Furthermore, Muslims are the only ones subject to Sharia law, so President Obasanjo has no say in the matter and has no power over its outcome.

A 2002 Petition called &quot;save Amina&quot; gathered a few thousand signatures then a 2003 e-communication with the subject line &quot;“Please Stop the International Amina Lawal Protest Letter Campaigns&quot; signed by Ayesha Iman and Sindi Medar-Gould who represented two Nigerian Human Rights organizations said the &quot;save Amina&quot; petition had some inaccuracies including a false assertion that execution of the sentence was imminent. They further contested that &quot;There is an unbecoming arrogance in assuming that international human rights organizations or others always know better than those directly involved, and therefore can take actions that fly in the face of their express wishes&quot;.

In May 2003, the official response of the Embassy of Nigeria in the Netherlands to the then Sharia-based trial of the State of Katsina in Nigeria, was that no court had given a stoning order on Lawal. They claimed the reports were &quot;unfounded and malicious&quot; and were &quot;calculated to ridicule the Nigerian judicial system and the country&#x27;s image before the international community.&quot; They claimed no knowledge of such a case.

Ambassador A.A. Agada of the Embassy of Nigeria in Washington D.C., U.S., was more forthcoming in recognizing the case of Lawal and stated on 29 August 2003: &quot;the Embassy wishes to inform that Malama Amina Lawal has three levels of courts of appeal before the final determination of her case. The Embassy hereby assures the general public that Malama Lawal&#x27;s right to a fair hearing under the Nigerian Constitution is guaranteed. Therefore due appellate processes will be followed to ensure the rule of law&quot;.

==In popular culture==
As noted in the Author Q&amp;A at the end of Will Ferguson&#x27;s novel &quot;419&quot;, the fictional character Amina—a young pregnant woman fleeing the Sharia states of northern Nigeria on foot—was based on Amina Lawal.

Alison M. Jaggar, an American philosopher, wrote an article in 2005 pertaining to this case, titled &quot;Saving Amina&quot;.

<doc id="327573" wikidata="Q2723747" url="?curid=327573" title="Bajrang Dal">
<text>Bajrang Dal () is a Hindu nationalist militant organisation that forms the youth wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). It is a member of the right-wing Sangh Parivar. The ideology of the organisation is based on Hindutva.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI/&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on 1 October 1984 in Uttar Pradesh, and began spreading more in the 2010s throughout India, although its most significant base remains the northern and central portions of the country.

The group runs about 2,500 akhadas, similar to the shakhas (branches) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The name &quot;Bajrang&quot; is a reference to the Hindu deity Hanuman. The Bajrang Dal&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Seva, Suraksha, Sanskar&quot; or &quot;Service, Safety and Culture&quot;. Some of the main goals of the Dal is to build Ram temple at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya and the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura, and also to expand the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, which are currently disputed places of worship. The Bajrang Dal opposes Muslim demographic growth, Christian conversion, cow slaughter, and western influence in Hindu culture.

==Ideology==

Bajrang Dal is a right-wing organisation. Together with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), the organisation has spoken out against Islamic terrorism in India and have announced that they will carry out awareness campaigns across the nation. They have stated that Islamic terrorists are hiding among the general population in India and mean to expose them. Convener Prakash Sharma stressed that they were not targeting any particular community, but were trying to &quot;wake up&quot; the people of India, particularly its youth, to the dangers of terrorism in the light of the 2002 Akshardham Temple attack perpetrated by terrorists linked to the militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba. Bajrang Dal shares the VHP&#x27;s position against cow slaughter and has supported proposals for banning it. The Gujarat branch is at the forefront of anti-beauty contest agitation. Another of its objectives is preventing Hindu-Muslim marriages.

==Social media presence==
Bajrang Dal is active on social media. Facebook&#x27;s security team has tagged it along with right wing organisations Sanatan Sanstha and Sri Ram Sena, as a potentially dangerous organisation that supports violence against minorities across India. Regardless the organisation has been allowed to spread on Facebook due to political and safety considerations. Facebook has avoided acting against Bajrang Dal as it has ties with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and because &quot;cracking down on Bajrang Dal might endanger both the company&#x27;s business prospects and its staff in India&quot;, The Wall Street Journal newspaper wrote, reaffirming its reportage earlier this year on the subject.

== Controversies, Criticism and Incidents ==
Bajrang Dal was banned in 1992 by the Rao government following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, but the ban was revoked one year later. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported the involvement of Bajrang Dal during the 1998 attacks on Christians in southeastern Gujarat where dozens of Churches and Prayer halls were burnt down by Sangh Parivar outfits. According to HRW, Bajrang Dal had been involved in riots against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.

In April 2006, two Bajrang Dal activists were killed in Nanded in the process of bomb-making. The same group of activists was also suspected of perpetrating the 2003 Parbhani mosque blasts. Those arrested told interrogators they wanted to avenge several blasts across the country. New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) subsequently accused the police of a coverup in Nanded. A report by the Secular Citizen&#x27;s Forum and People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Nagpur claimed to have found maps of mosques at the home of one of the deceased, on 24 August 2008 in Kanpur.

The VHP leader, Pravin Togadia, was arrested in April 2003 after distributing tridents to Bajrang Dal activists in Ajmer, defying a ban and prohibitory orders. He asserted that the coming Assembly polls in the Indian state of Rajasthan would be fought on the issue of tridents and attacked the ruling Indian National Congress Party for &quot;placating&quot; Muslims for electoral gains. He expressed satisfaction at the publicity received due to the incident.

The Bajrang Dal has been accused of not allowing Muslims to own land in parts of Gujarat by attacking traders who sell to Muslims, attacking Muslim homes and forcing the sale of the house or flat. This creates a ghettoisation of large cities in Gujarat, like Ahmedabad and Vadodara.

In June 2006, Bajrang Dal activists allegedly stormed a press meet, where 2 Christian rape victims were stating about their ordeal, accompanied by MP State Minorities Commission (MPSMC) member and prominent Christian leader Indira Iyengar. The district Convener Devendra Rawat had threatened the women about naming the right wing Hindu organizations, whose members were involved in the crime. In April 2017, Bajrang Dal members issued threats of rape and acid attacks against Assam based activist Bondita Acharya for condemning arrests of 3 people for possession of beef.

On several occasions, acting as &quot;Social Police&quot;, the activists of Bajrang Dal have indulged in moral policing and harassed un-married couples on Valentine&#x27;s Day and forced them to apply sindoor or tie rakhis against their wishes. The activists have often indulged in violence, invading gift shops and restaurants and threatening couples on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Bajrang Dal activists have also targeted and moral policed women for wearing clothes like Bikini, Crop top, tube top, and sleeveless dresses, as they display vulgarity and are not a part of Indian culture.

In September 2008, a fresh wave of attacks in Karnataka were directed against the Newlife Christian churches and prayer halls by the Bajrang Dal as a protest against defaming Hindu gods and religious conversion carried on by the Newlife Missionaries. Later, convenor Mahendra Kumar was arrested even after he publicly announced that they were not responsible for the attacks after the Federal Government of India had strongly criticised the State Government. In addition, the National Commission for Minorities has also blamed them for the religious violence in the BJP-ruled states of Karnataka and Odisha. While some police reports claim that the Bajrang Dal was not involved &quot;per se&quot; and that the attacks were carried out by splinter groups, the testimonies of their activists showed exactly the opposite, as they described the attacks and openly warned of more violence.

On 24 January 2009, members of Sri Ram Sene, a Bajrang Dal affiliate, attacked young men and women after dragged them out of a pub in Mangalore. A group of 40 activists of the Sena barged into the pub &quot;Amnesia — The Lounge&quot; and beat up a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalized. The video of the incident has become one of the most watched clips on YouTube, though how the TV crew happened to be ready at the &#x27;unannounced&#x27; attack is not known.

Starting 14 February 2011, there was a fresh wave of violence directed at people celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day in Kanpur city, in the province of Uttar Pradesh. &quot;Offenders&quot;, so called, are forced to hold their ears and do sit-ups as punishment for being caught celebrating the &quot;Western holiday&quot;. Police were called in to calm the sectarian violence and discrimination.

On 2 November 2014, during the Kiss of Love protest against moral policing, members of Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and many other right wing groups opposed and attacked protestors and threatened to strip protestors for kissing on the streets. These opposing groups claimed that public display of affection is against both Indian culture and the law of the land (under section 294 of the Indian Penal Code), though according to the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court, kissing in public is not a criminal offence. Police took many of the Kiss of Love protestors into custody to save their lives, but were blamed for giving a free hand to counter protestors of the right wing groups.

From 2015, Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad have been accused of promoting and indulging in Cow vigilantism, apparently targeting Muslims and lower caste Hindus, mostly Dalits. Human rights groups have slammed several state Governments for promoting and supporting such acts, even turning a blind eye. Police officers have been threatened by members of cow protection groups for intervening in such cases or arresting cow vigilantes. Following the Una Flogging incident in July 2016 in Gujarat, where 4 dalits were brutally thrashed by Bajrang Dal goons and vigilantes when they were skinning dead cow carcasses, the victims converted to Buddhism. The conversion irked some perpetrators, who attacked the victims for the second time when they were out on bail.

Following the death of the Dalit victim and subsequent forced cremation by Uttar Pradesh Police officials in the Hathras rape and murder, Bajrang Dal faced media criticism and widespread condemnation for supporting the accused as they belonged to the higher caste Thakurs and issued threats to the kin of the victim to drop the case, which eventually reinforced their ideology of caste bigotry. Several Bajrang Dal activists joined expelled BJP MLA Rajveer Singh Pehelwan, who held a protest rally to support the accused, after they were arrested. Along with members of Bajrang Dal, members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Karni Sena, Kshatriya Mahasabha, Savarna Samaj Sangathan, and Rashtriya Savarna Sangathan also attended the protest in October 2020. On 7 October 2020, the Ex-BJP MLA and 100 others were booked by the UP Police for organizing the rally. In April 2022, Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad activists clashed with Police Officers in Noida over the arrest of a rape accused.

Following the introduction of Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 in Uttar Pradesh to curb Love Jihad, Bajrang Dal, acting as a parallel police force, has been condemned for stopping consensual inter-religious and inter-caste marriages. Bajrang Dal has also been slammed for supporting patriarchy and called for restricting freedom of women, particularly to the point of when they choose their partners out of caste and religion.

Days before Christmas, on 5 December 2020, Bajrang Dal leader Mithu Nath openly threatened and warned of beating Hindus for visiting Churches in Assam&#x27;s Barak Valley. Following this, a case was filed against him by the Cachar district Deputy Commissioner of Police.

On 13 December 2021, Bajrang Dal spread violence in the congregation of a Hindu saint, some anti-social elements reached the gathering with sticks and guns and attacked unarmed people in which a person named Devi Lal Meena died.

In 2022, on the occasion of Valentine&#x27;s Day, several members of the Bajrang Dal protested in Hyderabad and Agra. The militants were caught harassing couples in Agra.

Beginning 2022, members of the right-wing Hindutva groups in India have protested against the sale of Halal food in India. Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindutva groups were running door to door campaign in Karnataka, asking people not to purchase Halal meat. In March 2022 the Hindutva group Bajrang Dal physically attacked a Muslim meat seller. Five people were arrested in the incident.

On 15 August 2022, the eleven men sentenced to life imprisonment in the Bilkis Bano gangrape case, which occurred during the 2002 Gujarat riots, were released from a Godhra jail by the Gujarat government. Following their release, the rapists were allegedly greeted with garlands from members of Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad. The release and felicitation was criticized by several activists and members of opposition, and the release itself is controversial, because the convicts were released as per the old 1992 Remission Policy instead of the aggressive 2014 Policy. The challenge to release the rapists, which was pending in Supreme Court after a review petition was filed, was dismissed in December 2022, earning criticism from women&#x27;s safety activists. The Supreme Court, however, redirected the Bombay High Court to look into the case. On 8 January 2024, the Supreme Court bench, led by Justices B.V. Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan, reversed the Gujarat Government&#x27;s decision and canceled the remission, noting that the convicts were freed erroneously. In its judgement, the bench noted several frauds committed by one of the convicts Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah, also known as Lala Vakil, who had filed the petition for remission, as he did not declare earlier remission petitions submitted to the Maharashtra State Government, as the trial was transferred to the High Court in Mumbai - the remissions were denied on the recommendation of CBI, as well as the magistrate and Superintendent of Police of Dahod, Gujarat. The Supreme Court eventually ordered the convicts to surrender within 2 weeks to carry out the remainder of their life sentences.

On 14 February 2023, Bajrang Dal activists were accused and criticized for intimidating couples across the nation against celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day, even physically attacking them. A few local citizens in Faridabad allegedly thrashed a few Bajrang Dal activists for attacking a couple sitting in a park, prompting police investigation.

On 16 February 2023, 2 Muslim men of Ghatmeeka village in Bharatpur district in Rajasthan, were abducted and burnt to death by Bajrang Dal members belonging to the neighboring state of Haryana, on suspicion of cow smuggling. Though Bajrang Dal leaders denied the killings, 2 of the accused were found to be tied to the outfit. The main accused, Monu Manesar, accused of cow vigilantism, has been granted shelter from certain police officers of Haryana. The Haryana Government and State Police have been criticized for assisting the culprits, with Bajrang Dal activists attempting to stop Rajasthan Police from investigation and arrest of the accused.

On 2 March 2023, Bajrang Dal activists attempted to stop a women&#x27;s night party in Shivamogga, Karnataka. The activists, who attempted to moral police the women&#x27;s group, claimed that women taking part in such events are against &quot;Hindu culture&quot;. Police were called to intervene and prevent any untoward incident.

The Bajrang Dal, along with Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been a major opponent of LGTBQ rights and describes homosexuality as mental disease. Several VHP activists have violently targeted LGBTQ parades across the country. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s judgement in April 2023 on same sex marriages, the VHP and Bajrang Dal welcomed the decision, calling it a Western attack on Indian culture.

Following the decision to add caste as a form of discrimination by the city of Seattle and the state of California in the United States in 2023, the leaders and supporters of Bajrang Dal&#x27;s parent organization Vishva Hindu Parishad criticized this decision and attempted to stop the legislations to pass the bill. The decision was taken after caste-based discrimination issues in Silicon Valley came to the surface in 2020 with a lawsuit by the State of California against Cisco Systems filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH, later named Civil Rights Department). The Department sued Cisco and two of its senior engineers for discrimination against a Dalit engineer (identified as &quot;John Doe&quot;), who alleged that he received lower wages and fewer opportunities because of his caste.

In the days leading up to the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, there were a number of incidents of violence and vandalism against minorities that were allegedly carried out by VHP and Bajrang Dal members. These groups, in their celebration, singled out religious minorities during the celebrations.

These incidents included:
* A clash between two groups in Mira Road, Maharashtra, which resulted in injuries
* A saffron flag being placed on top of a church in Madhya Pradesh
* A mob playing loud music and dancing near a mosque in Kodangal, Telangana
* A Muslim graveyard being set on fire in Bihar
* A Muslim man being forced to chant Hindu slogans in Maharashtra
* A right-wing Hindutva mob setting fire to a shop owned by a Muslim vendor as it conducted its rally from Daulatabad in Hathnoor mandal, Telangana.

On 2 February 2024, Police in Uttar Pradesh apprehended four individuals, including Monu Bishnoi, the Moradabad district president of the Bajrang Dal on charges related to cow slaughter, attempting to implicate a Muslim man in a fabricated case, and potentially hindering or conspiring against the police investigation. Bajrang Dal&#x27;s Monu Bishnoi was in jail in an attempt to murder case. Post-release, Bishnoi engaged in illegal activities, attempting to manipulate the Chhajlait police station.

On 14 February 2024, the Bajrang Dal, along with Vishva Hindu Parishad, intimidated and targeted couples who were celebrating Valentines Day. Several activists and leaders threatened resort to violence if clubs, pubs and corporate hotels across Hyderabad did not cancel celebrations for Valentines Day. The activists instead asked the youngsters to pay tribute to the soldiers and service-members who were killed in the 2019 Pulwama attack, which was perpetrated by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

On 13 February 2025, right before Valentines Day, Bajrang Dal activists engaged in moral policing against couples celebrating the western festival in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The activists, who were armed with rods and sticks were intimidating and harassing couples by chanting “Jai Bajrangbali” and “Jai Shri Ram”(Meaning Hail Lord Hanuman and Hail Lord Ram). The act of moral policing was heavily criticized across several media outlets. To prevent any incidents of harassment and moral policing, the Jamshedpur Police in Bihar made elaborate security arrangements for couples.

== Reception ==
The US State Department&#x27;s 2000 report on international religious freedom and 2000 World Report by the Human Rights Watch labelled this organisation as a Hindu extremist group. The US Central Intelligence Agency classified the Bajrang Dal and the VHP as religious militant organisations in the &quot;India&quot; entry of &quot;The World Factbook&quot; on 4 June 2018, but removed the mentions of the Bajrang Dal and the VHP from the entry by 25 June 2018.

The group has also been called &quot;terrorist&quot;, with Torkel Brekke referring to it as the &quot;best known among the terrorist groups controlled by the RSS&quot;. Paul Brass described the Bajrang Dal as Indian equivalent of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Sturmabteilung.

Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has called Bajrang Dal an embarrassment to the BJP and urged Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to &quot;rein them in&quot;. After the religious violence in Odisha, the Bharatiya Janata Party Prime Ministerial candidate L. K. Advani advised the Bajrang Dal to cease association with violence, concerned with the fact that it took pressure off the UPA government in Delhi.

==Demand for ban==

In September 2008, the Indian National Congress (INC) demanded a ban on the Bajrang Dal and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) which according to the INC are involved in anti-national activities. Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said &quot;White paper should be brought out not only against SIMI &quot;(Students Islamic Movement of India)&quot; but all organisations involved in anti-national activities like Bajrang Dal and VHP&quot;. Congress spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said, &quot;Those outfits involved in terrorist activity should be investigated, the question is why Bajrang Dal should not be banned&quot;. Muslim cleric Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahli, who is involved in the &quot;Movement Against Terrorism&quot;, also demanded a ban on this organisation in the wake of the Kanpur blast.

The monthly magazine &quot;Communalism Combat&quot; started by civil rights activists Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand demanded an immediate ban on the Bajrang Dal in August 2008.

Leader of the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) Ramchandra Paswan describing the Bajrang Dal as communal organisation said, &quot;Bajrang Dal and VHP should immediately be banned.&quot;

The Indian National Congress, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, former prime minister H. D. Deve Gowda and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati have demanded a ban on Bajrang Dal and Sri Rama Sena. In this regard, Deve Gowda sent a letter to prime minister and accused Bajrang Dal &quot;for perpetrating senseless violence&quot; against minorities in Karnataka and Odisha.

On 5 October 2008, the NCM recommended a ban on the Bajrang Dal and VHP for its alleged role in the attacks on Christian institutions in Karnataka. However, the ruling state government has the Minority commission&#x27;s recommendations and does not support this suggestion.

On 5 October 2008, the Indian Prime Minister called a special cabinet meeting to discuss a possible ban on the Bajrang Dal and the VHP over the continuing attacks on Christians and Christian institutions in Odisha and Karnataka.

Bajrang Dal, and its Odisha president Pratap Chandra Sarangi have been alleged to have links with the Graham Staines murder case. However, no proof has been established for the allegations.

<text>David Randolph Scott (born June 6, 1932) is an American retired test pilot and NASA astronaut who was the seventh person to walk on the Moon. Selected as part of the third group of astronauts in 1963, Scott flew to space three times and commanded Apollo 15, the fourth lunar landing; he is one of four surviving Moon walkers and the only living commander of a spacecraft that landed on the Moon.

Before becoming an astronaut, Scott graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and joined the Air Force. After serving as a fighter pilot in Europe, he graduated from the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62C) and the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class IV). Scott retired from the Air Force in 1975 with the rank of colonel, and more than 5,600 hours of logged flying time.

As an astronaut, Scott made his first flight into space as a pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, along with Neil Armstrong, in March 1966, spending just under eleven hours in low Earth orbit. He would have been the second American astronaut to walk in space had Gemini8 not made an emergency abort. Scott then spent ten days in orbit in March 1969 as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 9, a mission that extensively tested the Apollo spacecraft, along with Commander James McDivitt and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart.

After backing up Apollo 12, Scott made his third and final flight into space as commander of the Apollo15 mission, the fourth crewed lunar landing and the first J mission. Scott and James Irwin remained on the Moon for three days. Following their return to Earth, Scott and his crewmates fell from favor with NASA after it was disclosed that they had carried four hundred unauthorized postal covers to the Moon. After serving as director of NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center in California, Scott retired from the agency in 1977. Since then, he has worked on a number of space-related projects and served as a consultant for several films about the space program, including &quot;Apollo13&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Scott was born June 6, 1932, at Randolph Field (for which he received his middle name) near San Antonio, Texas. His father was Tom William Scott (1902–1988), a fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Corps who would rise to the rank of brigadier general; his mother was Marian Scott (; 1904–1999). Scott lived his earliest years at Randolph Field, where his father was stationed, before moving to an air base in Indiana, and then in 1936 to Manila in the Philippines, then under U.S. rule. David remembered his father as a strict disciplinarian. The family returned to the United States in December 1939. By the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the family was living in San Antonio again; shortly thereafter Tom Scott was deployed overseas.

As it was felt that he needed more discipline than he would receive with his father gone for three years, David was sent to Texas Military Institute, spending his summers at Hermosa Beach in California with his father&#x27;s college friend, David Shattuck, after whom he had been named. Determined to become a pilot like his father, David built many model airplanes and watched with fascination war films about flying. By the time of Tom Scott&#x27;s return, David was old enough to be allowed to go up in a military aircraft with him, and in David Scott&#x27;s autobiography remembered it as &quot;the most exciting thing I had ever experienced&quot;.

David Scott was active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving its second-highest rank, Life Scout. With Tom Scott assigned to March Air Force Base near Riverside, California, David attended Riverside Polytechnic High School, where he joined the swimming team and set several state and local records. Before David could finish high school, Tom Scott was transferred to Washington, D.C., and after some discussion as to whether he should remain in California to graduate, David attended Western High School in Washington, graduating in June 1949.

David Scott wanted an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point but lacked connections to secure one. He took a government civil service examination for competitive appointments and accepted a swimming scholarship to the University of Michigan where he was an honor student in the engineering school. In the spring of 1950, he received and accepted an invitation to attend West Point. Scott attended Michigan on a swimming scholarship, set a freshman record in the 440-yard freestyle, and the team captain during Scott&#x27;s year there, Jack Craigie, recalled that the West Point swimming coach, Gordon Chalmers, was happy to get Scott from Michigan, one of the dominant programs of the time.

Scott still wanted to fly and wanted to be commissioned in the newly established United States Air Force (USAF). The Air Force Academy was founded in 1954, the year Scott graduated from West Point; an interim arrangement had been made whereby a quarter of West Point and United States Naval Academy graduates could volunteer to be commissioned as Air Force officers. Earning a Bachelor of Science degree in military science, Scott graduated 5th in his class of 633 and was commissioned in the Air Force.

==Air Force pilot==
Scott did six months of primary pilot training at Marana Air Base in Arizona, beginning there in July 1954. He completed Undergraduate Pilot Training at Webb Air Force Base, Texas, in 1955, then went through gunnery training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.

From April 1956 to July 1960, Scott flew with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Soesterberg Air Base, Netherlands, flying F-86 Sabres and F-100 Super Sabres. The weather there was often poor, and Scott&#x27;s piloting skills were tested. Once, he had to land his plane on a golf course after a flameout. On another, he barely made it to a Dutch base on the edge of the North Sea. Scott served in Europe during the Cold War and tensions were often high between the U.S. and Soviet Union. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, his squadron was placed on the highest alert for weeks but was stood down without going into combat.

Scott hoped to advance his career by becoming a test pilot, to be trained at Edwards Air Force Base. He was counseled that the best way to get into test pilot school was to gain a graduate degree in aeronautics. Accordingly, he applied to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was accepted. He received both a Master of Science degree in Aeronautics/Astronautics and the degree of Engineer in Aeronautics/Astronautics (the E.A.A. degree) from MIT in 1962.

After receiving these degrees, Scott was stunned to receive orders from the Air Force to report to the new Air Force Academy as a professor, rather than to test pilot school. Although challenging orders was strongly discouraged, Scott went to the Pentagon and found a sympathetic ear from a colonel. Scott received changed orders to report to Edwards.

Scott reported to the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards in July 1962. The commandant of the school was Chuck Yeager, the first person to break the sound barrier, whom Scott idolized; Scott got to fly several times with him. Scott graduated top pilot in his class. He was selected for the Aerospace Research Pilot School, also at Edwards, where those intended as Air Force astronauts were trained. There he learned how to control aircraft, such as the Lockheed NF-104A, at altitudes of up to .

==NASA career==
In applying to be part of the third group of astronauts in 1963, Scott intended only a temporary detour from a mainstream military career; he expected to fly in space a couple of times and then return to the Air Force. He was accepted as one of the fourteen Group3 astronauts later that year.

Scott&#x27;s initial assignment was as an astronaut representative at MIT supervising the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer. He spent most of 1964 and 1965 in residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as backup CAPCOM during Gemini 4 and as a CAPCOM during Gemini 5.

===Gemini 8===
After the conclusion of Gemini 5, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton informed Scott that he would fly with Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8. This made Scott the first Group3 astronaut to become a member of a prime crew, and this without having served on a backup crew. Scott was highly regarded by his colleagues for his piloting credentials; another Group3 astronaut, Michael Collins, wrote later that Scott&#x27;s selection to fly with Armstrong helped convince him that NASA knew what it was doing.
Scott found Armstrong something of a taskmaster, but the two men greatly respected each other and worked well together. They spent most of the seven months before launch in each other&#x27;s company. One part of the training that Scott undertook without Armstrong was riding the Vomit Comet, where he practiced in preparation for a planned spacewalk.

On March 16, 1966, Armstrong and Scott were launched into space, a flight originally planned to last three days. The Agena rocket with which they were to dock had been launched an hour and forty minutes earlier. They carefully approached and docked with the Agena, the first docking ever accomplished in space. However, after the docking, there was unexpected movement by the joined craft. Mission Control was out of touch during this portion of the orbit, and the astronauts&#x27; belief that the Agena was causing the problem proved incorrect, for once they performed an emergency undocking, the spin only got worse. With the spacecraft spinning, there was a risk of the astronauts blacking out or the Gemini vehicle disintegrating. The problem was one of the craft&#x27;s Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) thrusters firing unexpectedly; the crew shut down those thrusters, and Armstrong activated the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to negate the spin. The RCS thrusters were to be used for reentry, and the mission rules said if they were activated early, Gemini8 had to return to Earth. Gemini8 splashed down in the Western Pacific on the day of launch; the mission lasted only ten hours, and the early termination meant that Scott&#x27;s spacewalk was scrubbed.

According to Francis French and Colin Burgess in their book on NASA and the Space Race, &quot;Scott, in particular, had shown incredible presence of mind during the unexpected events of the Gemini8 mission. Even in the middle of an emergency, out of contact with Mission Control, he had thought to reenable ground control command of the Agena before the two vehicles separated.&quot; This allowed NASA to check the Agena from the ground, and use it for a subsequent Gemini mission. Scott&#x27;s competence was recognized by NASA when, five days after the brief flight, he was assigned to an Apollo crew. Along with Armstrong, Scott received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and the Air Force awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross as well. He was also promoted to lieutenant colonel.

===Apollo 9===

Scott&#x27;s Apollo assignment was as backup senior pilot/navigator for what would become known as Apollo 1, scheduled for launch in February 1967, with Jim McDivitt as backup commander and Russell Schweickart as pilot. In that capacity, they spent much of their time at North American Rockwell&#x27;s plant in Downey, California, where the command and service module (CSM) for that mission was under construction.

By January 1967, Scott&#x27;s crew had been assigned as prime crew for a subsequent Apollo mission and were at Downey on January 27 when a fire took the lives of the Apollo1 prime crew during a pre-launch test. During the fire, the inward-opening hatch had proved impossible for the astronauts to open, and Scott&#x27;s post-fire assignment, with all flights put on hold amid a complete review of the Apollo program, was to serve on the team designing a simpler, outward-opening hatch.

After the pause, Scott&#x27;s crew was assigned to Apollo 8, intended to be an Earth-orbit test of the full Apollo spacecraft, including the Lunar Module (LM). There were delays in the development of the lunar module and in August 1968, NASA official George Low proposed that if Apollo 7 in October went well, Apollo8 should go to lunar orbit without a Lunar Module, so as not to hold up the program. The Earth-orbit test would become Apollo9. McDivitt was offered Apollo8 by Slayton, but turned it down on behalf of his crew (who fully agreed), preferring to wait for Apollo 9, which would involve extensive testing of the spacecraft and was dubbed &quot;a test pilot&#x27;s dream&quot;.

As command module pilot for Apollo9 Scott&#x27;s responsibilities were heavy. The LM was to separate from the CSM during the mission; if it failed to return, Scott would have to run the entire spacecraft for reentry, normally a three-man job. He would also have to go rescue the LM if it could not perform the rendezvous, and if it could not dock, would have to assist McDivitt and Schweickart in performing an extravehicular activity (EVA) or spacewalk, back to the CSM. Scott was somewhat unhappy, though, that CSM-103, which he had worked on extensively, would stay with Apollo8, with Apollo9 given CSM-104.
The planned February 28, 1969, launch date was postponed as all three astronauts had head colds, and NASA was wary of medical issues in space after problems on Apollo7 and Apollo8. The launch took place on March 3, 1969. Within hours of launch, Scott had performed a maneuver essential to the lunar landing by piloting the CSM &quot;Gumdrop&quot; away from the S-IVB rocket stage, then turned &quot;Gumdrop&quot; around and docked with the LM &quot;Spider&quot; still attached to the S-IVB, before the combined spacecraft separated from the rocket.

Schweickart vomited twice on the third day in space, suffering from space adaptation syndrome. He was supposed to do a spacewalk from the LM&#x27;s hatch to that of the CM the following day, proving that this could be done under emergency conditions, but because of concerns about his condition, simply exited the LM while Scott stood in the CM&#x27;s hatch, bringing in experiments and photographing Schweickart. On the fifth day in space, March 7, McDivitt and Schweickart in the LM &quot;Spider&quot; flew away from the CSM while Scott remained in &quot;Gumdrop&quot;, making him the first American astronaut to be alone in space since the Mercury program. After the redocking, &quot;Spider&quot; was jettisoned. The LM had gone over 100 miles (160km) from the CSM during the test.

The remainder of the mission was devoted to tests of the command module, mostly performed by Scott; Schweickart called these days &quot;Dave Scott&#x27;s mission&quot;; McDivitt and Schweickart had much time to observe the Earth as Scott worked. The mission stayed in space one orbit longer than planned due to rough seas in the Atlantic Ocean recovery zone. Apollo9 splashed down on March 13, 1969, less than four nautical miles (7km) from the helicopter carrier USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;, east of the Bahamas.

===Apollo 15===


Scott was deemed to have performed his duties well, and on April 10, 1969, was named backup commander of Apollo 12, with Al Worden as command module pilot and James Irwin as lunar module pilot. McDivitt had chosen to go into NASA management, and Slayton had seen Scott as a potential crew commander; Worden and Irwin were working on the support crews for Apollo9 and Apollo10, respectively. Schweickart was ruled out due to the space sickness episode. This put the three in line to be the prime crew for Apollo 15. Scott&#x27;s status as backup commander of the next flight allowed him to sit in the Mission Control room as Apollo 11, with his old crewmate Armstrong in command, landed on the Moon. That Scott, Worden, and Irwin would be the crew of Apollo15 was announced on March 26, 1970.
Apollo 15 would be the first J Mission, which emphasized scientific research, with longer stays on the Moon&#x27;s surface and the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). Already having an interest in geology, Scott made time during the training for his crew to go on field trips with Caltech geologist Lee Silver. The scientists were divided over where Apollo15 should land; Scott&#x27;s argument for the area of Hadley Rille won the day. As time dwindled towards the launch date, Scott pushed to make the field trips more like what they would encounter on the lunar surface, with mock backpacks simulating what they would wear on the Moon, and from November 1970 onwards, the training version of the LRV.

Apollo 15 launched from Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Complex 39A on July 26, 1971. The outward flight to the Moon&#x27;s orbit saw only minor difficulties, and the mission entered lunar orbit without incident. The descent to the Moon by the LM &quot;Falcon&quot;, with Scott and Irwin aboard, took place on the late afternoon of July 30, with Scott as commander attempting the landing. Despite difficulties caused by the computer-controlled flight path being to the south of what was planned, Scott assumed manual control for the final descent, and successfully landed the &quot;Falcon&quot; within the designated landing zone.

After landing, Scott and Irwin donned the helmets and gloves of their pressure suits and Scott performed the first and only stand-up EVA on the lunar surface, by poking his head and upper body out of the docking port on top of the LM. He took panoramic photographs of the surrounding area from an elevated position and scouted the terrain they would be driving across the next day. After deploying the LRV from its folded-up position on the side of the LM&#x27;s descent stage, Scott drove with Irwin in the direction of Hadley Rille. Once there, Scott marveled at the beauty of the scene. While their exploits were followed by a television camera mounted on the Rover and controlled from Earth, Scott and Irwin took samples of the lunar surface, including the rock Great Scott named after the astronaut, before returning to the LM to set up the ALSEP, the experiments that were to continue to run after their departure.
The second traverse, the following day (August 1) was to the slope of Mount Hadley Delta. At Spur Crater, they discovered one of the most famous lunar samples, a plagioclase-rich anorthosite from the early lunar crust, that was later dubbed the Genesis Rock by the press. On the third day, August 2, they went on their final moonwalk, an excursion cut short by problems with retrieving a core sample. On their return to the LM, Scott, before the television camera, dropped a hammer and a feather to demonstrate Galileo&#x27;s theory that objects in a vacuum will drop at the same rate. After driving the LRV to a position where the camera could view &quot;Falcon&quot; takeoff, Scott left a memorial to the astronauts and cosmonauts who had died to advance space exploration. This consisted of a plaque bearing their names, and a small aluminum sculpture, &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot;, by Paul Van Hoeydonck. Once this was done, Scott re-entered the LM, and soon thereafter, &quot;Falcon&quot; lifted off from the Moon.

Apollo 15 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean north of Honolulu on August 7, 1971. The first crew to land on the Moon and not be quarantined on return, the astronauts were flown to Houston, and after debriefing, were sent off on the usual circuit of addresses to Congress, celebrations, and foreign trips that met returning Apollo astronauts. Scott regretted the lack of quarantine, which he felt would have given them time to recover from the flight, as the demands on their time were heavy.

===Postal covers incident===

The crew had arranged with a friend named Horst Eiermann to carry postal covers to the Moon in exchange for about $7,000 for each astronaut. Slayton had issued regulations that personal items taken in spacecraft must be listed for his approval; which was not done for the covers. Scott carried the covers into the CM in his spacesuit; they were transferred to the LM en route to the Moon and landed there with the astronauts. Scott sent 100 of them to Eiermann, and in late 1971, against the astronauts&#x27; wishes, the covers were offered for sale by West German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger. The astronauts returned the money, but in April 1972, Slayton learned of the unauthorized covers and had Scott, Worden, and Irwin removed as backup crew members for Apollo 17. The matter became public in June 1972, and the astronauts were reprimanded for poor judgment by NASA and the Air Force the following month. The covers that the crew still had were initially impounded by NASA but were in 1983 returned to the astronauts in an out-of-court settlement, as the government felt it could not successfully defend the lawsuit, and that NASA either authorized the covers to be flown or was aware of them.

The press release that announced the reprimands, dated July 11, 1972, stated that the astronauts&#x27; &quot;actions will be given due consideration in their selection for future assignment&quot;, something that made it extremely unlikely that they would be selected to fly in space again. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that &quot;there are no forthcoming missions for which he [Scott] is being considered&quot;. Scott related in his autobiography that Alan Shepard, then head of the Astronaut Office, had offered him the choice between backing up Apollo17 or serving as a special assistant on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first joint mission with the Soviet Union; Scott had chosen the latter. Although a NASA spokesman had stated that Scott had no choice but to leave the Astronaut Corps, and this was reproduced in the press, Slayton&#x27;s supervisor, Christopher C. Kraft, stated that the Public Affairs Office at NASA had erred, and the transfer was not a further rebuke.

===NASA management===
In his role with Apollo-Soyuz, Scott traveled to Moscow, leading a team of technical experts. There he met the commander of the Soviet part of the mission, Alexei Leonov, with whom he would later write a joint autobiography. In 1973 Scott was offered the job of deputy director of NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center, located at Edwards, a place Scott had long loved. This allowed Scott to fly aircraft that reached the edge of space, and let him renew his acquaintance with the retired Chuck Yeager who was there as a consulting test pilot, and to whom Scott granted flying privileges.

On April 18, 1975, at age 42, Scott became the Center Director at Dryden. This was a civilian appointment, and to accept it, Scott retired from the Air Force in March 1975 with the rank of colonel. Kraft wrote in his memoirs that Scott&#x27;s appointment &quot;pissed off Deke to his eyebrows&quot;. Scott found the work interesting and exciting, but with budget cuts and the forthcoming end of Approach and Landing Tests for the Space Shuttle, in 1977 he decided it was time to leave NASA and retired from the agency on September 30, 1977.

==Post-NASA career==
Entering the private sector, Scott founded Scott Science and Technology, Inc. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Scott worked on several government projects, including designing the astronaut training for a proposed Air Force version of the Space Shuttle. One of Scott&#x27;s firms went out of business after the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster; though the company played no part in the disaster, subsequent redesign of parts of the shuttle eliminated Scott&#x27;s firm&#x27;s role. After &quot;Challenger&quot;, Scott served four years on the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee, formed to advise the Secretary of Transportation on the possible conversion of ICBMs to launch vehicles. In 1992 Scott was found by a Prescott, Arizona, court to have defrauded nine investors in a partnership organized by him. He was ordered to pay roughly $400,000 to investors in the partnership, which was to create technology to prevent aircraft mechanical breakdowns, but which was never developed.

Scott was a commentator for British television on the first Space Shuttle flight (STS-1) in April 1981. He also was a consultant on the film &quot;Apollo13&quot; and for the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Brett Cullen. Scott consulted on the 3D IMAX film, &quot;Magnificent Desolation&quot; (2005), showing Apollo astronauts on the Moon, and produced by Tom Hanks and the IMAX Corporation. He is one of the astronauts featured in the 2007 book and documentary &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;.
From 2003 to 2004, Scott was a consultant on the BBC TV series &quot;Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets&quot;. In 2004, he and Leonov began work on a dual biography/history of the &quot;Space Race&quot; between the United States and the Soviet Union. The book, &quot;Two Sides of the Moon: Our Story of the Cold War Space Race&quot;, was published in 2006. Armstrong and Hanks both wrote introductions to the book. Scott has worked on the Brown University science teams for the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter. For NASA, he has worked on the 500-Day Lunar Exploration Study and as a collaborator on the research investigation entitled &quot;Advanced Visualization in Solar System Exploration and Research (ADVISER): Optimizing the Science Return from the Moon and Mars&quot;.

Scott had taken two Bulova timepieces, a wristwatch and a stopwatch, with him to the Moon without advance authorization from Slayton. Scott wore the wristwatch on the third EVA, after his NASA-issued Omega Speedmaster lost its crystal. He sold the Bulova watch in 2015 for $1.625million, after which the company marketed similar timepieces, whose accompanying material mentioned Scott and Apollo15. Scott sued in federal court in 2017, alleging Bulova and Kay Jewelers were wrongfully using his name and image for commercial purposes, and in April 2018, a federal magistrate ruled he could proceed on some of his claims. The case was dismissed by agreement of the parties in August 2018, and in 2021, Bulova marked the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo15 with the issuance of a commemorative watch.

==Personal life==
In 1959 Scott married his first wife, Ann Lurton Ott. They had two children. In 2000, it was reported that he was engaged to British TV presenter Anna Ford; at the time he was still married to Ann Scott, although separated. His relationship with Ford had begun in 1999. By 2001, Scott and Ford had separated. He subsequently married Margaret Black, former vice-chairman of Morgan Stanley. David Scott and Margaret Black-Scott reside in Los Angeles.

==Awards, honors, and organizations==
Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans presented Scott and Armstrong the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1966 for their Gemini flight. Scott was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the Gemini8 flight. Vice President Spiro Agnew presented the Apollo9 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. At the ceremony, Agnew said, &quot;I am proud that America has forged to the forefront and established the leadership in space to match our new leadership on Earth.&quot; Scott received the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for the Apollo9 mission.

Agnew also gave the Apollo 15 crew the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Scott earned his second Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for Apollo15. On September 15, 1971, the city of Chicago hosted the Apollo15 crew in a parade attended by more than 200,000 people. Mayor Daley presented the crew with honorary citizenship medals. On August 25, 1971, the Apollo15 crew were honored with a ticker-tape parade in New York City. The city bestowed them with gold medals. Later that day, U.N. Secretary General Thant awarded the trio the first United Nations Peace Medal. At the Air Force Association&#x27;s annual dinner dance in September 1971, the Apollo15 crew were presented with the David C. Schilling Trophy, the association&#x27;s top flight award. Scott presented the Air Force and Air Force Association with items they flew to the Moon: sheet music of &quot;Into the Wild Blue Yonder&quot; and a U.S. Air Force flag. The Apollo15 crew and Robert Gilruth (director of the Manned Spacecraft Center) were awarded the 1971 Robert J. Collier Trophy, an annual award for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics. Scott received the De la Vaulx Medal, the Gold Space Medal, and the V.M. Komorav Diploma from for 1971 for his role in the Apollo15 flight. Scott was awarded his third NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1978.

Scott, Worden, and Irwin were granted honorary Doctorates of Astronautical Science from the University of Michigan in 1971. Scott was awarded an honorary doctor of science and technology degree from Jacksonville University in 2013. It was the first honorary degree bestowed by the university.

Scott is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society, an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Sigma Gamma Tau.

In 1982 Scott was inducted with nine other Gemini astronauts into the International Space Hall of Fame in the New Mexico Museum of Space History. Along with twelve other Gemini astronauts, Scott was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993.

On August 23, 2024, he received an honorary promotion to brigadier general in recognition of his service to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project and deputy director of the Dryden Flight Research Center.
