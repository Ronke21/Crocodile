<text>Kedah (), also known by its honorific Darul [[Aman (Islam)|Aman]] (دار الأمان; Arabic for &#x27;The Safe Abode&#x27;) and historically as Queda, is a state of Malaysia, located in the northwestern part of Peninsular Malaysia. The state covers a total area of over 9,000 km2, and consists of a mainland portion and the Langkawi islands. The mainland has relatively flat terrain, which is used to grow rice, while Langkawi is composed of mostly of uninhabited islands.

Kedah was previously known as Kadaram (; &#x27;) by the ancient and medieval [[Tamils]], Kataha or Kalahbar (;&#x27; or ; &quot;&quot;) by the Arabs, and &quot;Syburi&quot; (; ) by the Siamese when it was under their influence.

Kedah borders the state of Perlis to the north and shares an international boundary with the Songkhla and Yala provinces of Thailand. It borders the states of Perak to the south and Penang to the southwest.

The state&#x27;s capital is Alor Setar and the royal seat is in the capital&#x27;s suburb Anak Bukit. Other major towns include Sungai Petani (its largest urban area by population), and Kulim on the mainland, and Kuah on Langkawi.

== History ==
===Early history===
Around 788 BC, a large settlement may have been already established around the northern bank of Merbok River. The settlement consisted of a large area of Bujang Valley, covering branches of the Merbok and Muda River that was about 1,000 square miles in area. It was built at the estuary of a branch of Merbok River, now known as Sungai Batu. Archaeological evidence found in the Bujang Valley (Malay: &quot;Lembah Bujang&quot;) reveals that an animist settlement resided in ancient Kedah possibly as early as 110 AD. The discovery of a temple, jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and clay brick monuments probably dating back to 110 AD shows that a maritime trading route with south Indian Tamil kingdoms was already established since that time. The discoveries in the Bujang Valley also made ancient Kedah perhaps the most ancient settlement in Southeast Asia.

===Hindu-Buddhist Era===
Ancient Kedah was first mentioned in the Tamil poem Paṭṭiṉappālai written at the end of the second century AD. It described goods from &quot;Kadaram&quot; &quot;heaped together in the broad streets&quot; of the Chola capital. Apart from &quot;Kadaram&quot;, Kedah was known by various names at different times in Indian literature: &quot;Kataha-Nagara&quot; (in Kaumudi Mahotsava drama), &quot;Anda-Kataha&quot; (in Agni Purana), &quot;Kataha-Dvipa&quot; (in Samarāiccakahā), and &quot;Kataha&quot; (in Kathasaritsagara). In Middle Eastern literature, ancient Kedah was referred to as &quot;Qilah&quot; by Ibn Khordadbeh in the &quot;Book of Roads and Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Kalah-Bar&quot; by Soleiman Siraf &amp; Abu Zaid al Hassan in &quot;Silsilat-al-Tawarikh&quot; (travels in Asia), and &quot;Kalah&quot; by Abu-Dulaf Misa&#x27;r Ibn Muhalhil in &quot;Al-Risalah al-thaniyah&quot;. The Tang dynasty Buddhist monk, Yijing who visited the Malay Archipelago between 688 and 695, also mentioned a kingdom known as &quot;Ka-Cha&quot; in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, which according to him was thirty days sail from Bogha (Palembang), the capital of Sribogha (Srivijaya).

In the seventh and eighth centuries, Kedah was under the loose control of Srivijaya. Indian and Arab sources consider Kedah to be one of the two important sites during the Srivijaya period, often calling the king of the straits &quot;the ruler of Srivijaya and Kataha&quot;. In 1025, Rajendra I, the Chola king from Coromandel Coast in South India, captured Kedah in his Chola invasion of Srivijaya and occupied it for some time. A second invasion was led by Virarajendra of the Chola dynasty who conquered Kedah in the late 11th century. During the reign of Kulottunga I Chola overlordship was established over the Srivijayan province of Kedah in the late 11th century.

===Kedah Sultanate===
According to &quot;Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa&quot; or the &quot;Kedah Annals&quot;, Kedah was founded by a Hindu king named Merong Mahawangsa. According to the text further, the Sultanate of Kedah started in 1136 when King Phra Ong Mahawangsa converted to Islam and adopted the name Sultan Mudzafar Shah. However, an Acehnese account gave a date of 1474 for the year of the ruler of Kedah&#x27;s conversion to Islam. This later date accords with an account in the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; where a raja of Kedah visited Malacca during the reign of its last sultan seeking the honour of the royal band that marks the sovereignty of a Muslim ruler. However, in Thai chronicles it is told that Kedah was a Thai city like Nakhon Si Thammarat and was a part of Siamese kingdom but later was changed into a Malay state after invasion of Muslim kingdoms.

It was later under Siam, until it was conquered by the Malay sultanate of Malacca in the 15th century. In the 17th century, Kedah was attacked by the Portuguese after their conquest of Malacca, and by Aceh. In the hope that Great Britain would protect what remained of Kedah from Siam, the sultan handed over Penang and then Province Wellesley to the British at the end of the 18th century. The Siamese nevertheless invaded Kedah in 1821, and it remained under Siamese control under the name of Syburi. In 1896, Kedah along with Perlis and Setul were combined into the Siamese province of Monthon Syburi which lasted until it was transferred to the British by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.

===Incorporation into Malaya===

In World War II, Kedah (along with Kelantan) was the first part of Malaya to be invaded by Japan. The Japanese returned Kedah to their Thai allies who had it renamed Syburi, but it returned to British rule after the end of the war. Kedah became one of the states of the Federation of Malaya in 1948, which then achieved independence in 1957. Malaya was then enlarged to become Malaysia in 1963, joined by Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (independent in 1965).

== Geography ==

Kedah is the 8th largest state by land area and 8th most populated state in Malaysia, with a total land area of . The terrain is mostly flat in general, as the Kedah–Perlis Plain covers much of the state&#x27;s land area, from the district of Kuala Muda in the south towards the state of Perlis in the north. Owing to its alluvial properties, most of the plains have been developed for rice farming for centuries. Meanwhile, the northeastern towards the southeastern part of the state is particularly mountainous, especially in the districts of Padang Terap, Sik, Baling, Kulim and Bandar Baharu. The Kedah–Songkhla and Bintang Ranges formed the state&#x27;s boundary between the Thai provinces of Songkhla and Yala in the northeast, and the state of Penang in the southwest and Perak in the southeast. The Bintang Range is home to Mount Bintang, the state&#x27;s highest point, located on the border with Perak. Some parts of Kedah are also karstic, with areas punctuated by limestone hills called mogotes.

The major rivers within Kedah include the Kedah, Merbok, Muda and Kerian rivers. The Muda River serves as the southwestern border with Penang, while the Kerian River forms part of the southeastern boundary with Penang and Perak.

<text>The western yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) is a small passerine bird in the wagtail family Motacillidae, which also includes the pipits and longclaws. This species breeds in much of temperate Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, moving south to tropical Africa and southern Asia for the winter; the small population breeding in Egypt is however resident there.

It is a slender 15–16 cm long bird, with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. It is the shortest tailed of the European wagtails. The breeding adult male is basically olive above and yellow below. In other plumages, particularly in juveniles, the yellow may be diluted to whitish. The heads of breeding males come in a variety of colours and patterns depending on subspecies. The call is a high-pitched &quot;jeet&quot;. This insectivorous bird inhabits open country near water, such as wet meadows. It nests in tussocks, laying 4–8 speckled eggs.

== Taxonomy==
The western yellow wagtail was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Motacilla flava&quot;. In 1555 the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner had used the identical Latin name &quot;Motacilla Flava&quot; when describing this species in his book, &quot;Historia animalium&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this is now restricted to southern Sweden. The genus name &quot;Motacilla&quot; is the Latin name for the wagtail; although actually a diminutive of &quot;motare&quot;, &quot;to move about&quot;, from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of &quot;cilla&quot; as &quot;tail&quot;. The specific &quot;flava&quot; is Latin for golden-yellow.

This species&#x27; systematics and phylogeny is confusing. Dozens of subspecies have been described at one time or another, and some 15-20 are currently considered valid depending on which author reviews them. In addition, the citrine wagtail (&quot;M. citreola&quot;) forms a cryptic species complex with this bird; both taxa as conventionally delimited are paraphyletic in respect to each other. The populations of the Beringian region are sometimes separated as eastern yellow wagtail (&quot;M. tschutschensis&quot;).
===Subspecies===
The ten recognised subspecies are listed below. Plumage colours refer to males except when noted; females are often hard to impossible to identify to subspecies. Vernacular names of the European subspecies follow Svensson (1992).

The nominate blue-headed wagtail and yellow wagtail form a narrow hybrid zone in northern France. Birds from this zone vary in appearance, but one type, which resembles nominate blue-headed wagtail (except that the blue tones to the head are paler and more mauve and the white of the head is more extensive, particularly on the throat, ear-coverts, and supercilium) is colloquially referred to as Channel wagtail. A hybrid zone between &quot;M. f. flava&quot; and &quot;M. f. feldegg&quot; in Romania and nearby, sometimes distinguished as separate subspecies &quot;&quot;M. f. dombrowskii&quot; or &quot;M. f. superciliaris&quot;&quot;, is also variable, but often like &quot;M. f. feldegg&quot; except with a white supercilium, rather than a solid black head.
== In culture ==
In the Pyramid Texts of Old Kingdom Egypt, the yellow wagtail was considered a representation of Atum himself and might have been the first inspiration for the Bennu bird, which, in turn, is the supposed inspiration for the phoenix of Greek mythology.

<text>Maya ceramics are ceramics produced in the Pre-Columbian Maya culture of Mesoamerica. The vessels used different colors, sizes, and had varied purposes. Vessels for the elite could be painted with very detailed scenes, while utilitarian vessels were undecorated or much simpler. Elite pottery, usually in the form of straight-sided beakers called &quot;vases&quot;, used for drinking, was placed in burials, giving a number of survivals in good condition. Individual examples include the Princeton Vase and the Fenton Vase.

Used for a plethora of daily activities, such as the storage of food and beverages, ceramics were also a canvas of commemoration. There were three main types of ceramics used in daily life: bowls, plates, and cylinders. They were often monochrome, meaning that only one type of mineral slip was used. Polychrome pottery was more complex in nature and therefore more commonly used by the elite. Not only was polychrome pottery used as decoration, it was also used as a form of social currency—a physical display of status and others&#x27; approval.

As time progressed, various features were added to ceramics to go beyond the fundamental needs of vessels; For example, pellets were put in larger bowls to not only serve as something to hold food, but would also become instruments used in the same feasts.

Archaeological evidence has been found that suggests ceramics were used for industrial purposes. The discovery of highly uniform ceramic cylinders along with tools used in the production of salt indicate that the ceramics were used to mass-produce salt from brine.

Surveys of Maya ceramics a major part of the ongoing controversy over the degree of elite political control over aspects the subsistence economy, the extent of economic centralization, and how it reinforces power (a common debate in the archaeology of complex societies).

==Typology==
As defined and used by Southwestern archaeologists, a ware is &quot;a large grouping of pottery types which has little temporal or spatial implication but consists of stylistically varied types that are similar technologically and in method of manufacture&quot;, and &quot;a defined ware is a ceramic assemblage in which all attributes of paste composition (with the possible exception of temper) and of surface finish remain constant.&quot; Generally each pottery classification and terminology system then becomes rather specific to a particular archaeological site and/or period.

A classification system can be epistemologically useful:
What does a ceramic system “mean”? Most obviously, it means that Postclassic Petén potters recognized and adhered to a decorative canon—a set of rules—for design structure, layout, and colors. Vessel forms and proportions varied from ware to ware and settlement to settlement, but the principles
that structured what kinds of decoration were to be applied, and where and how, were strictly adhered to in at least three production resource-groups (minimally defined by paste compositions) throughout the lakes area (approximately seventy-five kilometers east–west) over three hundred years. In addition, we were eventually able to successfully predict the decorative types we would find (which would otherwise be a process of categorization) in each ceramic group. 
A type-variety classification system&#x27;s criticisms include that it leaves a lot of variability unaccounted for, it should be accompanied by modal analysis, and it has limited use with whole vessels.

===Petén Lakes Postclassic system===
&quot;Postclassic slipped and decorated pottery at sites in the Petén Lakes region was manufactured of three distinctive paste wares. These indicate minimally three production nodes of Petén Postclassic pottery, at least one for each paste. ... These paste wares were used to manufacture the three most common red-slipped ceramic groups of the Postclassic... [P]otters across the Petén Lakes area had a fairly uniform and widely shared set of ideas about what constituted proper pottery decoration regardless of their different clay and temper resources.&quot;
* &quot;Vitzil Orange-red Ware&quot;: coarse red-orange carbonate; used to manufacture &quot;Augustine&quot; ware.
* &quot;Snail-Inclusion Paste Ware&quot;: silty gray-to-brown with snail inclusions; used to manufacture &quot;Paxcamán&quot; ware.
* &quot;Clemencia Cream Paste Ware&quot;: marly “white” or cream; used to manufacture &quot;Topoxté&quot; ware.

&quot;Whether painted or incised, decoration appeared in circumferential bands on the interior walls of tripod dishes (Rice 1983, 1985, 1989). The bands are defined above and below by multiple lines and divided into two or four panels by vertical lines or placement of simple motifs, which also may appear inside the panels (see Rice and Cecil 2009). This decorative coherence structures the classificatory coherence of types and varieties in the slipped ceramic groups across the three paste wares: monochrome, black-painted, red-painted, and incised.&quot;

===Chocholá style===

Northern Yucatán; as they did not come directly from digs they are often &quot;labeled as &#x27;unprovenanced&#x27; and hence &#x27;unusable&#x27;. ... In 1973, the name Chocholá was first assigned to the waxy, chocolatey, bowls and cylinders, which due to their uniquely carved surfaces, stand out from the majority of ancient Maya ceramics. ... Coe named the style after a small village 30 kilometers southwest of Mérida, near the larger settlement of Maxcanu, from which he was told the ceramics originated&quot;

&quot;On a significant number of Chocholá pots the decorative information is restricted to hieroglyphics, either the diagonal band described above, or a more elaborate combination of diagonal glyph bands, rim texts, or a single large Calendar Round date.&quot; The Primary Standard Sequences are text that occurs usually as a rim text on many ceramic vessels from all parts of the Maya Lowlands. The PSS is a glyphic formula that refers to the dedication of a vessel, its method of adornment, the class of vessel involved, its use and content (cacao drinks and maize gruels), and sometimes the owner or artisan.

===Monte Albán typology===
A ceramic classification by paste color and texture first defined in is commonly used: &quot;gris&quot; (gray, abbreviated &quot;G&quot;), &quot;crema&quot; (cream, abbreviated &quot;C&quot;), &quot;café&quot; (brown, abbreviated &quot;K&quot;), and &quot;amarillo&quot; (yellow or orange, abbreviated &quot;A&quot;). &quot;Most ceramic types produced after the founding of Monte Albán are designated by an alphanumeric code indicating their ware and type number (e.g., G.12, C.11, K.17, A.9). In contrast, ceramic types dating to pre-Monte Albán phases generally have descriptive names (e.g., Socorro Fine Gray, Atoyac Yellow-White). Although Oaxaca archaeologists do not formally assign these types to the four ware categories defined by Caso et al. (1967), similar gray, brown, and buff/cream pastes were used by earlier (Middle Formative) potters, and several pre-Monte Albán types clearly were &quot;ancestral&quot; to particular types in the Monte Albán sequence (e.g., Drennan, 1976: 22; also Flannery and Marcus, 2005: 473; 2015: 115–116).&quot;

====Crema ware (cream)====

Designs could be incised or carved post-firing. &quot;In the Rosario phase and Early MA I, production loci generally produced both “costly” and utilitarian vessels. By Late MA I, the production of costly vessels was dominated by potters in the Cacaotepec-Atzompa locality northwest of Monte Albán, who specialized in the manufacture of elaborate cream ware (crema) vessels, while other communities produced primarily (though not exclusively) utilitarian vessels. We suspect that these patterns reflect the efforts of rulers at Monte Albán to control the production and distribution of elite pottery, particularly crema vessels.&quot;
&quot;Many other sites in which crema-ware ceramics were found were interpreted to have had close ties to Monte Albán, because these ceramics were only produced from clay sources located near the ancient city.&quot; The distribution of crema ware in combination with other archaeological evidence suggests &quot;efforts by the leaders of Monte Albán to control, perhaps because of trade, the valleys lying between the Valley of Oaxaca and the coast.&quot;

====Gris ware (gray)====

====Cafe ware (brown)====

====Amarillo ware (yellow or orange)====

===Slate ware===
characterized by its waxy and lustrous surface finishing, Late Classic to Early Postciassic in northwestern Yucatán peninsula. one of the most sophisticated ceramic traditions of Northern Yucatán, and encompasses a multitude of elite wares.

===Color types: red ware, orange ware, polychrome===

===Gralisa ware===
&quot;A distinctive incised and graphite-painted red ware pottery known only from Bajos de Chila and four other sites on Oaxaca’s central coast.&quot; Their great abundance and variety in Bajos de Chila and the Guatemala highlands have suggested a possible greater extent of Maya trade and influence, but Oaxaca coast excavations have been limited.

===Chocolate pots===
Spouted vessels of the Middle Preclassic (1000–400 B. C.) and Late Preclassic (400 B. C.-A. D. 250) Maya are traditionally called &quot;chocolate pots&quot;, but lacked direct evidence that they had use in association with cacao until recently.

===Unique styles===
Stamped or mould-made pottery are generally rare among Maya ceramics.

==Decoration==
The utilitarians ware of the common people usually had simple decoration that reflected its use. Vessels in the palace were more elaborately decorated by carved forms or highly skilled polychrome paintings with hieroglyphs which named their function, the patron and rarely, the artist signature. For example, cylindrical bowls used for cacao drinks often had the plant species &quot;Q. guatemalteca&quot; depicted on them because that flower was used to enhance the flavor of the cacao drink. Designs often included rituals, supernatural figures or common day practices. Rulers were often depicted next to deities and shown to be equal, or nearly equal, in power and status as them. Other pots functioned more as storytelling devices, with glyphs from the Maya script that likely were guides for songs or other ritualistic texts.

For many potters, decoration and imagery was more important than the structure of each vessel. Cylindrical vases and plates were popular because they maximized the surface area for storytelling through imagery on each piece. There was more evolution in pictorial representations than shapes. As the complexity of painting increased, vessel shapes remained fairly simple. Different regions in Mesoamerica also featured different color schemes regarding the area. In Holmul the color scheme surrounded reds and oranges on a white background. Black backgrounds often indicate supernatural forces featured in the plate&#x27;s scene or the depiction of the underworld because of the dark color used. Different regions also featured a variety of regional symbols depicted on pottery. In Tikal, the Tikal Dancer represents the young Maize God, often depicted with his arms outspread and one leg bent, and has been seen on eighty-two compiled plates. The Maize God was incredibly important to Maya culture because the god not only symbolized the Maya&#x27;s main resource but rebirth as well. In the Popol Vuh, the Maize God is represented in a cyclical nature in order for the Maya to understand the human life cycle. By placing an important figure in Maya culture onto pieces of pottery, it provides a higher importance of the pottery itself and its purpose. The Holmul Dancer, although similar to the Tikal Dancer in positioning, features a male dancing with a small dwarf or hunchback figure off to one side and has been seen on forty-five compiled vessels. Although the decoration had a higher importance, structure was still taken in to account. Specific pieces often featured other characteristics such as rattle feet, hollow cylinders located on the bottom of the plate that hold a ball on the inside. The rattle feet were often used for ritual purposes in the form of music because when shaken, the plate rattles. Pieces created with a diameter over 0.3m were often used for ceremonial feasts and those with smaller diameters, often including jars, were used for storage.

== Ceramics in society ==
Maya ceramics are made from two main types of materials that relate to their social structure, limestone and volcanic ash. Most of the land around the Mayans was limestone, which is where calcite comes from. These were mainly made as gifts and given to make local alliances, and these vessels are found in a more localized area. Whereas the ones made from volcanic ash are more widespread because they were thought to be given as gifts from the upper class to make very large alliances, through the Maya trade systems.

Although the Maya are well known for creating a multitude of art, they are perhaps most well-known for their pottery. The Maya used these potteries to perform their sacrifice rituals with melodic tones. Because these rituals were a way of praying for rain, the blood spilled by the sacrificial victim (frequently a prisoner of war) was a form of asking their gods for rain and bounty in agriculture. Since these two components are connected, with rain, the Maya would have grown along with their agriculture.

Ceramics played a big role in society during the Maya Classic Period, when the Maya elite used ceramics not only to give gifts to foreign dignitaries, but they were also used in feasts during the Classic Period. Specialized pottery was made for the graves of nobles. Not anyone could make this pottery as it was very important they knew about the Maya history, mythology, and more. On these ceramics, intricate scenes were depicted which showed the palace life of the elite. The decorative scenes needed to feature the elite because they were the primary customers and wanted to have artwork that featured themselves. On each ceramic piece near the rim, its contents would be listed out, a type of beverage for a vase or food for a plate, then who it belonged to was written next. The rim also may feature Saurian head labels which may indicate a specific location where the piece was made or where the scene on the piece took place. Since these ceramics were traded and gifted, many end up in differing environments. In Teotihuacan, many ceramics from Tikal have been found due to being traded between traveling merchants between different cities in Mesoamerica. Specialists mainly pay attention to the writing, drawings, and hieroglyphs, since they were different for the different people and cultures they were made by. As for the everyday use more simple ware was made, generally of only one color, and would be produced in large quantities for the general public use. Maya pottery only weakly correlates to socio-economic levels of Maya society because of the value the culture emphasized ceramics. Rituals were where the Maya registered status rather than in pottery.

== Economics ==
There is evidence in Postclassic Oaxaca that there was significant local production and trade of ceramics independent of the markets at the region imperial capital of Tututepec.

== Production techniques ==
The Maya had specific techniques to create, inscribe, paint, and design pottery. To begin creating a ceramic vessel the Maya had to locate the proper resources for clay and temper. The present-day indigenous Maya, who currently live in Guatemala, Belize and southern Mexico still create wonderful ceramics. Prudence M. Rice provides a look at what the current Guatemalan Maya use today for clay. Highland Guatemala has a rich geological history comprised mainly from a volcanic past. The metamorphic and igneous rock, as well as the sand and ash from the pumice areas provide many types of tempering. In the area, there are a range of clays that create varied colors and strengths when fired. Today&#x27;s Maya locate their clays in the exposed river systems of the highland valleys. It is hypothesized that the ancient people obtained their clay by the same method as today&#x27;s Maya. The clays are located in exposed river systems of the highland valleys. Most likely, due to the climatic similarities over the last millennia it is likely that these same deposits or similar ones could have been used in early times.

Once the clay and temper were collected, pottery creation began. The maker would take the clay and mix it with the temper (the rock pieces, ash, or sand). Temper served as a strengthening device for the pottery. Once worked into a proper consistency, the shape of the piece was created.
A potter&#x27;s wheel was not used in creating this pottery. Instead, they used coil and slab techniques. The coil method most likely involved the formation of clay into long coiled pieces that were wound into a vessel. The coils were then smoothed together to create walls. The slab method used square slabs of clay to create boxes or types of additions like feet or lids for vessels. Once the pot was formed into the shape, then it would have been set to dry until it was leather hard. Then, the pot was painted, inscribed, or slipped. The last step was the firing of the vessel. Kilns were used to fire the vessels, and they were normally found outside in the open air. Unlike many modern kilns, they were fired by wood, charcoal, or even grass.

Like the Ancient Greeks, the Maya created clay slips from a mixture of clays and minerals. The clay slips were then used to decorate the pottery. By the fourth century, a broad range of colors including yellow, purple, red, and orange were being made. However, some Mayan painters refrained from using many colors and used only black, red, and occasionally cream. This series of ceramics is termed the &quot;Codex Style&quot;, it being similar to the style of the Pre-Columbian books.

From the 5th century onwards, post-firing stucco was adopted from Teotihuacan. By preparing a thin quicklime, the Maya added mineral pigments that would dissolve and create rich blues and greens that added to their artistic culture. The original use of the Maya Blue that is so well known was for ritualistic purposes in pre-Columbian times by combining indigo, copal, and palygorskite to burn as incense which left a blue hue used for many other types of art later on in Maya history. Many times this post-fire stucco technique was mixed with painting and incising. Incising is carving deeply or lightly into partially dried clay to create fine detailed designs. This technique was mostly popular during the Early Classic Period.

==Development chronology==

The Maya were a diverse people whose culture has developed through the centuries. As they developed, so did their pottery. Archaeologists have found stages of commonality between types of ceramics, and these phases coincide with the Mayan timeline.

Middle Preclassic (900/800-250 BC) Late Preclassic (250 BC- AD 250) Early Mayan ceramics stemmed from a past that began even years before the Maya became a group. Originally, the early Maya used gourds cut into useful shapes to create vessels to carry liquids and foodstuffs. These portable and durable gourds made excellent containers. The first ceramics closely resembled gourds and many were decorated with rocker stamps and simple slips. During the Late Preclassic period, many of the ceramics took on appendages of tetrapod mammiform supports. These supports were four legs underneath the pot holding it up. Tetrapods are relatively rare in the Maya Lowlands- even in the Peten where they were first described. Characteristic cream-on-red stripes colored these unique vessels.

The pottery of the Maya Early Classic dated from AD 250 to 550. The Maya soon began using polychrome slip paint, meaning they used many different colors to decorate the pots. This method of decoration became almost homogeneous for Mayan potters, thus signaling the beginning of the Classic Period. Across the Classic period, Maya pottery has little comparisons between its assemblages. Polychrome pottery was a luxury item not commonly available to the general population. Most Early Classic Ceramics were monochrome types. Figural Polychromes were an elite prerogative, probably produced by and for other elites. The Classic Period of the Maya provided beautiful ceramics in many forms. The lidded basal flange bowl was a new style of potter to add to the already growing repertoire. This type vessel usually had a knob on top in the form of an animal or human head, while the painted body of the animal or human spreads across the pot. Many of these pots also had mammiform supports, or legs. These unique vessels are usually found in great condition signaling a ritual function. The reason many are in good condition is their frequent use as burial goods. As such, they are often the target of looters who cut deep trenches through many Maya buildings in search of a marketable vessel.
==Sample timelines==
There is no &#x27;standard&#x27; timetable for Maya ceramics. There is significant variability in timing and content between sites. The first table below lists the ceramic complexes for Uaxactun (1955, modified, 2000), and may not apply to any other site.

Version of a Maya ceramic timetable, adapted from a tourist booklet for Chichen Itza, 1984, based on Valliant&#x27;s work from 1927, and modified from Smith&#x27;s 1955 work at Uaxactun. It is a mix of phases, types, and technology, and therefore of no indicative value.

<doc id="336707" wikidata="Q2705509" url="?curid=336707" title="USS Randolph (CV-15)">
<text>USS &quot;Randolph&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-15) was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The second US Navy ship to bear the name, she was named for Founding Father Peyton Randolph, president of the First Continental Congress. &quot;Randolph&quot; was commissioned in October 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning three battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS).

In her second career she operated exclusively in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean. In the early 1960s she served as the recovery ship for two Project Mercury space missions, including John Glenn&#x27;s historic first orbital flight. She was decommissioned in 1969 and sold for scrap in 1975.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Randolph&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; ships. She was laid down on 10 May 1943 in Shipway 10, at Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 28 June 1944, sponsored by Rose Gillette (wife of Guy M. Gillette, a US Senator from Iowa). &quot;Randolph&quot; was commissioned on 9 October 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Following shakedown off Trinidad, &quot;Randolph&quot; got underway for the Panama Canal and the Pacific. On 31 December, she reached San Francisco where Air Group 87 was detached and Air Group 12 reported on board for four months duty.

On 20 January 1945, &quot;Randolph&quot; departed San Francisco for Ulithi, from which she sortied on 10 February with Task Force 58 (TF 58). She launched attacks on 16–17 February against Tokyo airfields and the Tachikawa engine plant. The following day, she made a strike on the island of Chichi Jima. On 20 February, she launched three aerial sweeps in support of ground forces invading Iwo Jima and two against Haha Jima. During the next four days, further strikes hit Iwo Jima and combat air patrols were flown almost continuously. Three sweeps against airfields in the Tokyo area and one against Hachijo Jima followed on 25 February before the carrier returned to Ulithi.

Riding at anchor at Ulithi on 11 March, a Yokosuka P1Y1 &quot;Frances&quot; &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit &quot;Randolph&quot; on the starboard side aft just below the flight deck, killing 27 men, including four reported missing and five transferred to the hospital ship where they later died, and wounding 105, during Operation Tan No. 2.

The initial damage assessment by the ship&#x27;s captain and later confirmed by task force commander, Admiral Raymond Spruance, was that &quot;Randolph&quot;″s damage was beyond the repair capabilities at Pearl Harbor and the ship would have to return to Navy facilities on the US west coast, effectively taking &quot;Randolph&quot; out of action for some five months, including the upcoming invasion of Okinawa. At this point, &quot;Randolph″s&quot; catapult officer was able to convince the captain and Spruance that repairs could be completed at sea utilizing , a repair ship in the immediate vicinity.

What ensued became the most extensive repair at sea ever performed by the US Navy. The captain&#x27;s first act was to move number six (forward) arresting-gear catapult engine aft to replace the destroyed number one engine. This returned &quot;Randolph&quot;, very quickly, to an operational status. With &quot;Randolph&quot; able to launch and retrieve aircraft, and thus defend herself, repairs focused on the massive task, at the ship&#x27;s stern, involving the replacement of structural steel components forming the hangar deck, aircraft elevator framework and flight deck support, all warped or destroyed by the fires ignited by the kamikaze hit. Some 29 tons of structural steel, including I-beams salvaged from a Japanese sugar mill on newly liberated Saipan, were utilized. An additional 7,500 board feet of lumber was required to repair &quot;Randolph’s&quot; flight deck. In the words of Cmdr. Charles Minter, assistant air officer on board &quot;Randolph&quot;, &quot;That decision to remain in the forward area [for repairs] allowed us to complete the war in an operational status. I doubt anyone could estimate how long we would have been in the yard had we gone back to the States, and the loss of the &quot;Randolph&quot; at that particular time would have been crucial. Slingin&#x27; Sam (Lt. Cmdr. Samuel Humphreys) saved the day&quot;.

Working twenty four hours a day at sea off Ulithi, &quot;Randolph’s&quot; repairs, initiated after the fires from the 11 March kamikaze attack were extinguished, were completed by 1 April, the launch date of the Okinawa invasion. &quot;Randolph&quot; joined Task Force 58 on 7 April. Combat air patrols (CAP) were flown daily until 14 April, when strikes were sent against Okinawa, Ie Shima, and Kakeroma Island. The following day, an air support mission of fighters, bombers, and torpedo planes hit Okinawa and a fighter sweep struck an airfield in southern Kyūshū. Under daily air attack from 17 April on, &quot;Randolph&quot; continued to send her aircraft on CAP and support missions throughout the month.

In May, planes from the carriers hit the Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan, Kikai (Amami Islands) naval base and airfields, and Kyūshū airfields. Becoming the flagship of TF 58 on 15 May, &quot;Randolph&quot; continued her support of the occupation of Okinawa until 29 May, when she retired via Guam to the Philippines. On 7 June, while loading supplies in the Philippines, a P-38 Lightning practicing strafing runs lost control and crashed against the deck of the &quot;Randolph&quot;, killing thirteen sailors and destroying ten of Randolph&#x27;s aircraft. USS &quot;Jason&quot; repaired &quot;Randolph&quot; in four days, due to the damage being far less severe than the Kamikaze attack.

On her next war cruise, as a part of Admiral Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet, &quot;Randolph&quot; made a series of strikes up and down the Japanese home islands. With Air Group 16 replacing Air Group 12, the ship launched eight raids on 10 July against airfields in the Tokyo area, principally those on the peninsula east of Tokyo Bay. On the 14th, her planes struck the airfields and shipping in and near Tsugaru Strait. In this attack, two of the important Honshū-Hokkaidō train ferries were sunk and three were damaged. Attacks on the Japanese home islands continued for the next few days, and on 18 July, the Japanese battleship – lying camouflaged alongside a pier at the Yokosuka Naval Base – was bombed.

Moving southwest, &quot;Randolph&quot; and other carriers were off the coast of Shikoku on 24 July, for an anti-shipping sweep of the Inland Sea, during which the carrier-battleship was heavily damaged and airfields and industrial installations on Kyūshū, Honshū, and Shikoku were hit hard. &quot;Randolph&quot;″s pilots estimated that from 10 to 25 July they had destroyed 25 to 30 ships, ranging in size from small luggers to a 6000-ton freighter, and had damaged 35 to 40 others. &quot;Randolph&quot;″s strikes continued right up to the morning of the 15 August surrender, when her planes hit Kisarazu Airfield and surrounding installations.

===Post-war===
Following the end of the war, &quot;Randolph&quot; headed home. Transiting the Panama Canal in late September, she arrived at Naval Station Norfolk on 15 October, where she was rigged for &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; service. Before the end of the year, she completed two trips to the Mediterranean area to return American servicemen. Then, in 1946, she became a training ship for reservists and midshipmen, and made a Mediterranean cruise in the latter half of the year. After another voyage to the Caribbean, she embarked midshipmen in the early summer of 1947 for a cruise to northern European waters. &quot;Randolph&quot; was placed out of commission, in reserve, 25 February 1948, and berthed at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

In June 1951, &quot;Randolph&quot; commenced her SCB-27A modernization program at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. To handle the new generation of carrier aircraft, the flight deck structure was reinforced. Stronger elevators, more powerful hydraulic catapults, and new arresting gear were installed. The island structure was rebuilt, the anti-aircraft turrets were removed, and blisters were added to the hull. Reclassified CVA-15 on 1 October 1952, &quot;Randolph&quot; recommissioned on 1 July 1953. After a shakedown cruise off Guantánamo Bay with Carrier Air Group 10, she took on Carrier Air Group 14, departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean, and joined the 6th Fleet on 3 February 1954, deployed for 6 months of Fleet and NATO exercises until 6 August 1954. &quot;Randolph&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 18 June 1955 for the installation of an angled flight deck and other SCB-125 modernizations.

Leaving the yard in January 1956, &quot;Randolph&quot; conducted air operations off the East Coast for the next six months, and was the first Atlantic Fleet carrier to launch a Regulus guided missile from her flight deck. On 14 July 1956, &quot;Randolph&quot; again steamed east for a seven-month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. When Israel, Britain, and France invaded the United Arab Republic in October of that year, &quot;Randolph&quot; stood ready. Operating near the Suez Canal, her aircraft provided air cover and surface and air reconnaissance for the evacuation of U.S. nationals from Alexandria. She returned to the United States on 19 February 1957. After a few months operating off the East Coast, &quot;Randolph&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean again on 1 July 1957. Between August and December, as political turmoil in Syria threatened to further disturb the already turbulent Mideast, she patrolled the eastern Mediterranean. Back in the United States on 24 February 1958, the carrier made her fifth Mediterranean deployment from 2 September 1958 to 12 March 1959.

&quot;Randolph&quot; was reclassified CVS-15 on 31 March 1959, and conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations off the East Coast throughout that year and the next, receiving her fourth consecutive Battle Efficiency Award in September 1960. From October 1960 to March 1961, &quot;Randolph&quot; underwent the SCB-144 upgrade as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization program. She received the new SQS-23 bow sonar, as well as improved displays in the Combat Information Center.

In the summer of 1962, &quot;Randolph&quot; again steamed to the Mediterranean. Returning to the western Atlantic as the Cuban Missile Crisis broke, she operated in the Caribbean from the end of October through November. On 27 October, &quot;Randolph&quot; and a group of eleven US Navy destroyers entrapped a nuclear-armed Soviet near Cuba and started dropping practice depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. Reportedly, the captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, believing that a war might already have started, prepared to launch a retaliatory nuclear-tipped torpedo, but Second Captain Vasily Arkhipov persuaded the captain to surface to await orders from Moscow. After an overhaul at Norfolk, &quot;Randolph&quot; resumed her station in the Atlantic. Over the next five years, she made two Mediterranean cruises and a northern European cruise, while spending most of her time off the East Coast and in the Caribbean.

In July 1961, &quot;Randolph&quot; sailed for operations in the Caribbean and served as the recovery ship after splashdown for astronaut Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom on America&#x27;s second manned space flight, a suborbital shot. In February 1962, &quot;Randolph&quot; was the primary recovery ship for astronaut John Glenn on his flight, the first American orbital voyage in space. After his historic three-orbit flight, he landed safely near the destroyer from which he was transferred, by helicopter, to &quot;Randolph&quot;. On 1 April 1964, in an unusual accident, the Number Three deck elevator of &quot;Randolph&quot; tore loose from the ship during a vicious storm at night and fell into the Atlantic off Cape Henry, Virginia, taking with it a Grumman S-2D Tracker, five crewmen, and a tractor. Three crew were rescued by the destroyer , but two were lost at sea.

===Decommissioning===
On 7 August 1968, the Defense Department announced that it would inactivate &quot;Randolph&quot; and 49 other ships to reduce fiscal expenditures in 1969. &quot;Randolph&quot; was decommissioned on 13 February 1969 at Boston Navy Yard and laid up in the reserve fleet at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. &quot;Randolph&quot; was stricken from the Navy List on 1 June 1973. In May 1975, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service sold the ship to Union Minerals &amp; Alloys for $1,560,000. &quot;Randolph&quot; was towed to Kearny, New Jersey, and broken up for scrap. One of her anchors is located on the river front in Toms River, New Jersey. Another anchor was placed at a Naval Reserve unit in Kingsport, Tennessee. That building was later designated for decommissioning and destruction. With the blessing and approval of the Randolph Association, that anchor was kept in Kingsport and then relocated in 1990 to Sullivan North High School for representation of their newly commissioned NJROTC program. After the closing of that school, the anchor was moved on 7 June 2023 to its new home in Lebanon Missouri where it&#x27;s being refurbished and being placed on display in the city&#x27;s Veterans Park with a dedication on Veterans Day, 11 November 2023. Her binnacle is preserved at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum.

<text>The citrine wagtail(Motacilla citreola) is a small songbird in the family Motacillidae.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;citrine&quot;, and the specific name &quot;citreola&quot;, refers to its yellowish colouration.

==Taxonomy==
Its systematics, phylogeny and taxonomy are subject of considerable debate in the early 21st century. This is because this bird forms a cryptic species complex with the eastern (&quot;M. tschutschensis &quot;) and western yellow wagtail (&quot;M. flava&quot;). Which of the many taxa in this group should properly refer to which population is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future.

&quot;Motacilla&quot; is the Latin name for the pied wagtail; although actually a diminutive of &quot;motare&quot;, &quot; to move about&quot;, from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of &quot;cilla&quot; as &quot;tail&quot;. The specific &quot;citreola&quot; is Latin for &quot;lemon yellow&quot;.

==Description==
It is a slender, 15.5–17 cm long bird, with the long, constantly wagging tail characteristic of the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot;. The adult male in breeding plumage is basically grey or black above, with white on the remiges, and bright yellow below and on the entire head except for the black nape. In winter plumage, its yellow underparts may be diluted by white, and the head is brownish with a yellowish supercilium. Females look generally like washed-out versions of males in winter plumage.

==Distribution==
This species breeds in the central Palearctic in wet meadows and tundra. It migrates in winter to South Asia, often to highland areas. Its range is expanding westwards, and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe. Vagrants seem to extend the migration rather than straying ; in Bhutan, for example, though along one of the species&#x27; migration flyways, the citrine wagtail has been recorded as an extremely rare passer-by rather than staying even for a few days or weeks.

==Ecology==
It is an insectivorous bird of open country near water, such as wet meadows and bogs, and nests on the ground, laying 4–5 speckled eggs.

<text>Hofheim (; officially known as Hofheim am Taunus) is the administrative centre of Main-Taunus-Kreis district, in the south of the German state of Hesse. Its population in September 2020 was 39,946.

==Geography==
===Location===
The town is located on the south side of the Taunus hills, 17 km west of Frankfurt and 17 km east of both Wiesbaden and Mainz; Frankfurt Airport is 12 km to the southeast.

Hofheim is located in the Rhine Main Area, one of the fastest-growing regions in Germany in terms of population and also in regard to economic productivity. Unemployment is the second lowest in the state of Hesse and one of the lowest in Germany.
It is mainly surrounded by forest and open country. The highest point of Hofheim is the mountain Judenkopf in the Lorsbach district, with a height of 410 metres. As well as being the administrative centre of the Main-Taunus-Kreis, Hofheim is its economic hub.

==History==
===Early history===

The oldest traces of human life in the area around Hofheim date back to the Palaeolithic period, with the oldest find dating back to around 40,000 B.C. From the Neolithic period from around 5000 B.C. onwards, settlement areas on the banks of the Schwarzbach, on both sides of today&#x27;s Schmelzweg and on the Kapellenberg have been identified. Especially the Michelsberg culture around 4400 to 3500 B.C. is shown by numerous traces of settlements and finds on the Kapellenberg (Ringwallanlage). Around 30/40 A.D., the area was settled by the Romans, who built the Hofheim fort here as a two-phase complex - first an earth fort and from 75 A.D. under Emperor Vespasian also a stone fort, which existed until 110 A.D. - in order to secure the Wetterau region, to protect the route between Mainz and Nidda in today&#x27;s Frankfurt-Heddernheim, and to protect the Limes triangle, among other things. The fort was built by the Romans as a two-phase complex.

===Middle Ages===

The first documented mention was in 1254 under the name Hoveheim, but the suffix -heim indicates a much earlier Frankish foundation. Hofheim belonged to Count Philipp VI the Elder of Falkenstein, when Emperor Charles IV on 21. This document gave the lords of Hofheim the right to build walls, gates and bridges, to erect a gallows, to hold court, to conduct crafts and to hold a market. In the imperial war against Philip the Elder of Falkenstein (Falkenstein Feud), the town was conquered by the Electorate of Mainz in 1366, to which it was subject until 1418. This was followed by the rule of the Counts of Eppstein-Königstein until the extinction of the dynasty in 1535. During this time, the first Jews were recorded in Hofheim. Within the 16th century, the owners changed only twice. From 1535 to 1574 the dominion of Eppstein-Königstein belonged to Count Ludwig von Stolberg, who introduced the Reformation in Hofheim in 1540, and from 1574 to 1581 to Christoph von Stolberg. But already in 1559 Elector and Archbishop Daniel Brendel von Homburg had redeemed an old pledge and thus regained Eppstein and Hofheim. After the death of Christoph von Stolberg, the rest of the county of Königstein also went to the Electorate of Mainz in 1581.

Under the reign of Wolfgang von Dalberg, Archbishop and Elector of Mainz, and his successor Johann Adam von Bicken, the witch trials in the Electorate of Mainz reached their peak in the period from 1588 to 1602 in both the Höchst and Hofheim districts. From the remains of old court records, the Aschaffenburg archive remains, 23 women could be identified who were accused of witchcraft, 15 of them found death at the stake. On November 3, 2010, the town council of Hofheim am Taunus decided to rehabilitate the citizens convicted of witchcraft.

Until the beginning of 1603, Protestantism was still the predominant religion among the inhabitants despite the town&#x27;s affiliation with the Catholic Electorate of Mainz. It was not until June of that year that the Protestant pastor was replaced by a Catholic one. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Spanish, Bavarian, Swedish and French troops occupied, plundered and devastated the town and its present-day districts. Inhabitants were tortured into revealing the hiding places of cattle, horses and household goods. In addition to famine, epidemics broke out again and again, and in 1635 the plague spread through the region. In Hofheim, the number of men (burghers) dropped from 76 and 13 widows to 27 within four years in 1635 (no subdivision into men and widows). Finally, at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, there were 40 men and 4 widows. Children, women and bystanders were not recorded in counts as a matter of principle. From 1665 on, the plague raged in Mainz and Frankfurt as well as in the region of today&#x27;s Main-Taunus district.

The following year Hofheim was still free of the plague and on July 3, 1666, Pastor Gleidener led the inhabitants in a procession to the &quot;Rabberg&quot; (today&#x27;s Kapellenberg) to take a vow: If the town was spared from the plague, a chapel should be built on this spot in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The chapel was built in 1667 and replaced by a successor building in 1774.

Hofheim is also described in the &quot;Topographia Hassiae&quot;:
With the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, a 26-year period of peace ended for Hofheim. The population had come to a modest prosperity and had grown to a thousand inhabitants. With the occupation of the city of Mainz by French Revolutionary troops and finally of the city of Frankfurt in 1792, Hofheim residents began years of suffering. Alternating troop marches and quarterings brought looting, famine, and epidemics.

In the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, Hofheim fell to the principality of Nassau-Usingen. In 1806, it was united with the principality of Nassau-Weilburg. Together they formed the Duchy of Nassau. In 1866 this was annexed by Prussia and from then on existed as the province of Hesse-Nassau. After Hofheim had long been sidelined in terms of transportation, the town was connected to the railroad network from 1874 to 1877 with the construction of the Main-Lahn Railway between Frankfurt and Limburg. A renewed economic upswing began. Hofheim had also become interesting for Taunus tourists from Frankfurt thanks to the rail connection.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The First World War 1914-1918 claimed its victims: 121 men fell in acts of war. Numerous inhabitants, especially children, died as a result of malnutrition. After the armistice treaty of November 11, 1918, an occupation of Hofheim by French troops followed as early as December 2, which lasted until 1929 (officially until 1930) ( Allied occupation of the Rhineland). Hofheim was located within the thirty-kilometer radius around Mainz, which had to be cleared of German soldiers - in accordance with the victors&#x27; demands. Within these zones were the cities of Cologne and Koblenz, the area on the right bank of the Rhine, and the city of Kehl (the latter with a smaller radius).

In 1933, the National Socialists took power in Hofheim as well. In the Reichstag election on March 5, 36.91 percent of the residents in Hofheim voted for the NSDAP. In the municipal elections on March 12, 1933, the NSDAP won 6 of 12 seats. The other seats were held by the SPD (3) and the Center Party (3). On June 22, the SPD was banned, and the Center Party dissolved under massive pressure on July 5. Thus, the NSDAP was the only remaining party in Hofheim&#x27;s city parliament and, as of July 24 anyway, by law the only permitted party in the German Reich. The NSDAP was the only party in Hofheim&#x27;s city parliament.

By April 11, 1933, the previous mayors in 13 municipalities in the Main-Taunus district had been replaced by NSDAP members. Since 1920, Oskar Meyrer held the office of mayor in Hofheim and was to keep it until his death on August 1, 1942. After that, the position was not filled again, but continued to be held by the local group leader Georg Kaufmann on a deputy basis.

Discrimination and persecution of Communists, Social Democrats, members of the Confessing Church, and especially Jewish residents began as soon as the Nazis came to power. There had been a Jewish community since the Middle Ages. Around 1800, a synagogue had been established by the members in the former Wehrturm/Büttelturm. In 1933 the community comprised about 35 members. In the night of November 9–10, 1938 (Reichspogromnacht) this synagogue was devastated. Because of the narrow buildings in the old town, the synagogue was not set on fire. A similar fate befell the synagogue in Wallau (since 1977 a district of Hofheim). Only a few inhabitants were able to save themselves by emigrating abroad; the others were deported and were murdered in concentration camps. The almost 500-year-old Jewish community which had numbered around 40~ people since the 19th century was destroyed.

On January 1, 1980, Hofheim im Taunus became the administrative centre of the Main-Taunus-Kreis, although the move was not completed until 1987 with the completion of the new administrative building in Hofheim. The administrative seat was previously in the Frankfurt district of Höchst, which was part of the county as an independent town of Höchst am Main until its incorporation into Frankfurt in 1928.

In 1988, the city of Hofheim was the 28th Hessentag city.

Between 2008 and 2014, 89 stumbling blocks for victims of National Socialism were laid in the town of Hofheim and the districts of Marxheim, Diedenbergen, Wallau and Langenhain by the artist Gunter Demnig.

* The Alois Kottmann Award for classical violin pieces in the canto-style is an international award bestowed following a competition during the International Days of Music Hesse Main-Taunus Hofheim which take place annually in May or June.
* In 1988, the town hosted the 28th &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival.

<text>Felix Wakefield (30 November 1807 – 23 December 1875) was an English colonist, who settled in New Zealand.

==Early life==
Felix Wakefield was born in 1807, the seventh child and sixth son of Edward Wakefield (1774–1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crush (1767–1816) of Felstead. His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751–1832), was a popular author for the young, and one of the introducers of savings banks. He was the brother of: Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793–1873), the mother of Charles Torlesse (1825–1866); Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796–1862); Daniel Bell Wakefield (1798–1858); Arthur Wakefield (1799–1843); William Hayward Wakefield (1801–1848); John Howard Wakefield (1803–1862); Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809–1887); Percy Wakefield (1810–1832); and an unnamed child born in 1813.

In 1831 Felix married Marie Bailley, by whom he had nine children.

==Life==
When he left school Felix began working with his father and training as a surveyor and civil engineer. This was interrupted, however, in 1826 as a result of the scandal surrounding his brothers, Edward Gibbon and William Wakefield and also his stepmother. When he eventually finished his training he rejoined his father, now in exile in Blois, France. Soon afterwards he impregnated a servant girl, Marie Bailley and was required to marry her. In 1832 the young family emigrated to Tasmania where Felix was employed as a surveyor. Although initially successful, Felix&#x27;s work did not impress the authorities and such was his personality that when criticised he usually resorted to litigation and argument. As a result of this, he became extremely unpopular and eventually unemployable. Various attempts to recoup his fortunes were unsuccessful and by 1846 the family was destitute. Abandoning his wife and youngest child in Tasmania, Felix took the other eight children and returned to England.

Most of the responsibility for supporting the family fell on his older sister, Catherine Torlesse, mother of Charles Torlesse, and brother, Edward Gibbon, who was himself recovering from a major stroke. But Edward Gibbon was also involved in the promotion and planning of a new scheme for the colonisation of New Zealand, the Canterbury Association, under the auspices of the Church of England and he persuaded himself that his brother Felix and his surveying skills had a contribution to make. The plan that Felix drew up for surveying the Canterbury Plains was largely adopted and contributed significantly to the early success of the colony. However, it was not easy, as Felix was just as hard to work with in England as he had been in Tasmania.

Eventually, relations between the brothers were so bad that Edward Gibbon more or less wrote off his brother&#x27;s debts, paid him a substantial sum of money, and sent him off to New Zealand.

==New Zealand==
Felix Wakefield arrived in New Zealand with six of his children in November 1851 and immediately began feuding with the agents of the Canterbury Association about the land allocated to him. There were also questions about various sums of money that he was unable to account for satisfactorily. A few months later he leased the store at Redcliffs, installed his children in the care of his eldest daughter, Constance, now twenty years old, and departed for Wellington.

In Wellington, he met up with another brother, Daniel Bell Wakefield, resumed his campaign against Edward Gibbon, and started a new campaign aiming to have the administrators of the Canterbury Settlement replaced. Then at the end of March, after less than five months in the colony, he returned to London. There he continued his vendettas with such vehemence that he was summoned to appear in court, charged with uttering threats against the Canterbury Association&#x27;s Land Agent, John Robert Godley. And then, just as precipitately, he returned to New Zealand.

He arrived in Nelson, New Zealand in 1854, bringing with him two red deer. They thrived in New Zealand and went on to destroy much of the country&#x27;s native forests. Felix returned to Canterbury where here his welcome was very cool. By August he was again in trouble, this time for attempting to evict the tenant from a building owned by his nephew, Jerningham Wakefield. Shortly afterwards he quit Canterbury, this time taking his children with him and returned to Nelson where they stayed for a short while before sailing once again back to England.

He stayed away from New Zealand for ten years, during much of the time he was involved in litigation over various issues about land in New Zealand. He also served in the Crimean War, acting briefly as an engineer on the construction of the Balaclava Railway. He may also have been involved in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.

Finally in January 1864 he returned to New Zealand, this time bringing with him a flock of skylarks. He settled in Nelson for a while, tried Canterbury for a period and then moved on to Wellington and then back once again to Nelson where in 1870 he was employed as a post office clerk until he retired in 1874. Wakefield died of a heart attack in Sumner on 23 December 1875. He is buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery.

His son Edward Wakefield was a New Zealand politician and journalist.

<text>Jón Leifs (born Jón Þorleifsson on 1 May 1899 – 30 July 1968) was an Icelandic composer, pianist, and conductor.

==Life==
Jón Leifs was born &quot;Jón Þorleifsson,&quot; at the farm Sólheimar, then in the Húnavatnssýsla, northwestern Iceland. He left for Germany in 1916 to study at the Leipzig Conservatory. He graduated in 1921 having studied piano with Robert Teichmüller, but decided not to embark on a career as a pianist, devoting his time instead to conducting and composing. During this period he also encountered the legendary pianist-composer Ferruccio Busoni, who urged him to &quot;follow his own path in composition&quot;.

In the 1920s Jón Leifs conducted a number of symphony orchestras in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Denmark, thus becoming the only internationally successful Icelandic conductor to date, although he failed to obtain a fixed position. During a tour of Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland with the Hamburger Philharmoniker, he gave the very first symphonic concerts in Iceland in the summer of 1926 (a total of 13 concerts with different programmes). During this period, he was also very active as a writer on music and musical interpretation, both in German and Icelandic. Between 1925 and 1928, he travelled through Iceland on three occasions to record folk songs among the population in his home county Húnavatnssýsla in Northern Iceland. His observations on this were published in both Icelandic and German periodicals.

Beginning with piano arrangements of Icelandic folk songs, Jón Leifs started an active career as a composer in the 1920s. From the 1930s he concentrated his efforts on the composition of large orchestral works, some of which were not performed until after his death. Most of his output is inspired by Icelandic natural phenomena. In the piece &quot;Hekla&quot; he depicts the eruption of the volcano Hekla which he witnessed. &quot;Dettifoss&quot; (Op. 57) was inspired by Dettifoss, Europe’s second most powerful waterfall. In the &quot;Saga Symphony&quot; he musically portrays five characters from the classic Icelandic sagas.

In 1935 Jón Leifs was appointed Musical Director of the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. However, having found it difficult to implement his vision for the radio service, he resigned from the post in 1937 and returned to Germany.
Jón Leifs married the pianist Annie Riethof soon after graduating from the Leipzig Conservatory. They had two daughters, Snót Jónsdóttir and Líf Jónsdóttir, and made their home first in Wernigerode. Since Riethof was Jewish, the family lived under constant threat of Nazi persecution. In 1944, the couple managed to obtain permission to leave Germany and moved to Sweden with their daughters. However, by this time their marriage was showing signs of strain and they divorced in 1946. Jón Leifs later married, and divorced, a Swedish woman, Thea Andersson. His third wife, who survived him, was Þorbjörg Jóhannsdóttir Leifs (1919–2008). She and Jón had one son, Leifur (1957–2022).

In 1945 Jón Leifs moved back to Iceland (leaving his family in Sweden), and became a fierce proponent of music education and of artists’ rights. This included working for the ratification by Iceland of the Berne Convention, which happened in 1947, and setting up the Performing Rights Society of Iceland (STEF) in 1948.

In 1947 tragedy struck. Jón Leifs’ younger daughter Líf drowned in a swimming accident off the coast of Sweden in 1947, aged only eighteen. Overcome with grief, he composed four works dedicated to her memory, including &quot;Requiem&quot; Op. 33b for mixed choir, perhaps his most celebrated piece. The other works are &quot;Torrek&quot; Op. 33a, for solo voice and piano, &quot;Erfiljóð&quot; (In memoriam) Op. 35 for male choir, and the string quartet &quot;Vita et mors&quot; Op. 36.

Jón Leifs composed his last work, &quot;Consolation, Intermezzo for string orchestra&quot;, as he had only weeks to live. He died of lung cancer in Reykjavík in 1968.

Jón Leifs and his first wife are the subjects of the film &quot;Tears of Stone&quot; (&quot;Tár úr steini&quot;) (1995) by Icelandic director Hilmar Oddsson. A square in Bergholz-Rehbrücke (Nuthetal, Germany), where he lived with his family from the 1930s until 1944, is named after him. An English-language biography, &quot;Jón Leifs and the Musical Invention of Iceland&quot;, by the musicologist Árni Heimir Ingólfsson, was published in 2019 and was listed as one of the year&#x27;s most notable books by The New Yorker critic Alex Ross (music critic).

<doc id="336752" wikidata="Q3357564" url="?curid=336752" title="Otakon">
<text>Otakon ( ) is an annual three-day anime convention held during July/August. From 1999 to 2016, it took place at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland&#x27;s Inner Harbor district; in 2017, it moved to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. The convention focuses on East Asian popular culture (primarily anime, manga, music, and cinema) and its fandom. The name is a portmanteau derived from &quot;convention&quot; and the Japanese word &quot;otaku&quot;.

==Otakorp==
Otakon is run by the Pennsylvania-based non-profit organization Otakorp, Inc. whose primary purpose &quot;is to promote the appreciation of Asian culture, primarily through its media and entertainment&quot;.

==Programming==
Typical Otakon programming includes anime and live action East Asian films shown on big screens in multiple video rooms. Fan-produced content including fan-parodies and anime music videos (AMVs) are also shown. For several years, Otakon had a dedicated 35 mm film theater, but replaced it in 2008 with an HD theater to take advantage of the wider array of offerings in that format. Panels and workshops are held on subjects such as voice acting, how to draw manga, and Japanese culture. Industry professionals announce new acquisitions, and expert guests discuss or show tricks of their trade and field questions from the audience. Many panels and workshops are conducted by fans rather than pros (ex. &quot;Create a Comic Project&quot;). The convention also includes cosplay and a skit-based Masquerade show, which in the years before the convention moved to Washington D.C. had taken place inside the Royal Farms Arena.

==History==
Otakon 2020 was cancelled due to its venue, the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, being converted to a field hospital to treat COVID-19 patients during the ongoing pandemic.

===Event history===

===Locations===

The first Otakon was held at a Days Inn in State College, Pennsylvania in 1994; 350 people attended.

====Baltimore====

From 1999 to 2016, Otakon was held at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2011, the Baltimore city tourism agency, Visit Baltimore, gave Otakon a &quot;Customer of the Year&quot; award for &quot;demonstrat[ing] ongoing commitment to Baltimore, bringing more than 27,000 attendees to the city every year, a much-anticipated event by the local community and media&quot;. Otakon has been a top convention for Baltimore since 2003. Otakon 2009 had an economic impact of $12.5 million in direct spending and booked over 4,500 hotel rooms. According to the &quot;Baltimore Business Journal&quot; on December 10, 2010, Otakon 2010 had 4,575 booked hotel rooms and an estimated economic impact of $15.3 million, up from $12.5 million the year before; in particular it had significant impact on food vendors.

====Washington, DC====
Beginning in 2017, Otakon moved to Washington, DC, to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

====Las Vegas====

From 2014 to 2018, a spin-off convention also run by Otakorp had been held in January at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2018, shortly after the end of Otakon Vegas 2018, Otakorp, Inc. announced on the Otakon Vegas website that Otakon Vegas was going on hiatus for an undetermined amount of time and that Otakon Vegas 2018 would be the last Otakon Vegas held. Otakorp, Inc. described Otakon Vegas as being an &quot;experiment&quot; and stated that they were &quot;taking some time to examine the results of this experiment, to rethink and reorganize the show logistics, and to determine how best to bring the show forward.&quot; They left the door open for a future Otakon Vegas by concluding that they &quot;hope to return to Vegas in the future.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="336771" wikidata="Q2547545" url="?curid=336771" title="Vogue Records">
<text>Vogue Records was a short-lived United States–based record label of the 1940s, noted for the artwork embedded in the records themselves. Founded in 1946 as part of Sav-Way Industries of Detroit, Michigan, the discs were initially a hit, because of the novelty of the colorful artwork, and the improved sound compared to the shellac records dominant at the time. The discs were manufactured by first sandwiching printed illustrations around a core of aluminum, then coating both sides with clear vinyl upon which the grooves were stamped.

The company went out of business the following year, having released between 67 and 74 double-sided 78 rpm gramophone records. Some of the Vogue issues were re-releases of recordings originally issued by other companies.

The colorful artwork on the records have made Vogue Records a collector&#x27;s item.

Two releases on the Vogue label have been the source of much collector debate over the years: the 1946 releases by the country swing group the Down Homers &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Kiss You When I&#x27;m Gone?&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie Yodel&quot; have often been cited as featuring the earliest recorded performances by future rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley, who was a member of the group in 1946. However this rumor was later debunked by surviving members of the Down Homers as well as Haley researchers. Nonetheless, the Vogue Down Homers releases are considered among the more collectable of the label&#x27;s releases.

<doc id="336773" wikidata="Q15024" url="?curid=336773" title="Donald Tsang">
<text>Sir Donald Tsang Yam Kuen (; born 7 October 1944) is a former Hong Kong civil servant who served as the second Chief Executive of Hong Kong from 2005 to 2012.

Tsang joined the colonial civil service as an Executive Officer in 1967, occupying various positions in local administration, finance and trade before he was appointed Financial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1995, becoming the first ethnic Chinese to hold the position under British administration. He continued to serve in the Hong Kong SAR government after 1997 and gained his reputation internationally for his intervention in Hong Kong&#x27;s stock market in defending the Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s peg to the US dollar during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Tsang became the Chief Secretary for Administration in 2001 and ran for the Chief Executive in 2005 after incumbent Tung Chee-hwa resigned. He served the remaining term of Tung and was re-elected in 2007. He served a full five-year term until he stepped down in 2012. In his seven years of term, he proposed two constitutional reform proposals in 2005 and 2010 and saw the second ones passed after he reached a compromise with the pro-democracy legislators, making it the first and only political reform proposals to be passed in the SAR history. He carried out a five-year policy blueprint and ten large-scale infrastructure projects during his term. His popularity began to decline after the introduction of the Political Appointments System which was marked by controversies and scandals.

In the last months of his term, Tsang was embroiled by various corruption allegations. He was subsequently charged by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and was found guilty of one count of misconduct in public office in February 2017 and was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment, becoming the highest officeholder in Hong Kong history to be convicted and imprisoned. His name was later cleared when the Court of Final Appeal unanimously quashed his conviction and sentence in June 2019, on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury.

==Early life and government career==
Tsang was born in Hong Kong on 7 October 1944 to a Hong Kong police officer. His family ancestry is from Foshan in Guangdong. He spent his childhood living in the Hollywood Road Police Married Quarters in Central, Hong Kong. After completing his secondary education at Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, a Jesuit school in Hong Kong, he worked briefly as a salesman at US drug company Pfizer Inc. before joining the civil service.

Tsang joined the Civil Service as an Executive Officer in January 1967 and held many positions dealing with local administration, finance, trade and policies relating to the return of Hong Kong to China. In 1977, Tsang was attached to the Asian Development Bank in Manila for a year and worked on water supply and railway development projects in the Philippines and Bangladesh. He was subsequently sent by the government to complete a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government of the Harvard University in 1981.

Tsang was responsible for implementing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984 to decide the Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty to be transferred to China in 1997, and the promotion of the British Nationality Selection Scheme as Deputy Secretary of the General Duties Branch between 1985 and 1989. In 1989, he was appointed Director of Administration to oversee the functioning of the Government Secretariat. In 1991 he became Director-General of Trade and in charge of all facets of trade negotiation and administration affecting Hong Kong. In May 1993, he was promoted to Secretary for the Treasury, responsible for the overall resource allocation, the taxation systems and the cost effectiveness of the Hong Kong government.

==Financial Secretary==
In September 1995, Tsang was appointed Financial Secretary, becoming the first Chinese to hold the position in 150 years of colonial history. He went on to become the first Financial Secretary in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 1 July 1997. Shortly before the handover, he was knighted by Prince Charles at the Government House in June 1997.

During his term as Financial Secretary, Tsang coined the term &quot;caring capitalism&quot; in 1996, which describe the governments&#x27;s approach of giving priority to economic growth and then using the new-found wealth to develop social infrastructure and welfare services. Hong Kong&#x27;s public spending grew steadily as public revenue remained robust and government budget in surplus. Public expenditure to GDP rose to as high as 23%, though still the lowest among developed economies. He also approved a raise in civil servants&#x27; salaries at the beginning of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The salary raise was finally reversed, aligning civil servants&#x27; salaries to 1997 levels.

Tsang was known for his role in defending the Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s peg to the US dollar during the 1997 Asian financial crisis in 1998 from attacks by hedge funds led by George Soros who he dubbed &quot;crocodiles&quot;. He joined hand with Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and bought over $15 billion in Hong Kong stock to defend Hong Kong&#x27;s exchange rate and to make the government the biggest shareholder in many blue chip firms. Tsang&#x27;s action successfully led to the retreat of the hedge funds and earned his reputation internationally.
==Chief Secretary==
In 2001, Tsang succeeded Anson Chan who retired citing personal reasons to be the Chief Secretary for Administration, the second-ranking position in the government. It was widely believed that Chan resigned from the government in protest against Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s introduction of the Principal Officials Accountability System, which altered the capacity of the Chief Secretary from civil servant to political appointee. 

Under the new system, the power of the Chief Secretary as the head of the civil service was largely taken away by the Chief Executive and all ministers would only report to the Chief Executive directly. Donald Tsang found his major task as Chief Secretary was to implement Tung&#x27;s order to launch a &quot;Team Clean Campaign&quot; to clean up the city in May 2003 after the SARS outbreak.

As he was generally regarded as being sidelined by Tung, Tsang was untainted by major policy blunders, such as the controversy over the legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 which led to a historic massive demonstration on 1 July 2003. He remained topping in popularity polls among all the officials in Hong Kong as Chief Secretary.

==Chief Executive bid==

On 11 March 2005, incumbent Tung Chee-hwa announced his resignation, citing poor health. Tung&#x27;s resignation was approved by the central government the next day and Tsang took over becoming the acting Chief Executive. After Tung&#x27;s resignation, Tsang was tipped as Beijing&#x27;s favoured next Chief Executive. On the afternoon of 25 May 2005, Tsang resigned as Chief Secretary and announced his Chief Executive candidacy on 2 June 2005 after his resignation was accepted by the central government. He was elected unopposed by the 800-member Election Committee on 16 June 2005 and was formally appointed by the central government as the Chief Executive on 21 June 2005. However, the term of the Chief Executive was disputed, which led to the interpretation of the Basic Law by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee on 27 April to clarify that Tsang would only serve out the remaining two years of Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s term, rather than the full five years as some legal professionals argued.

==Chief Executive==
===First term (2005–07)===
====2007/08 constitutional reform====

Tsang developed a warm relationship with the pan-democrats during the early months of his first term. Pan-democrat legislator Albert Chan gave his nomination to Tsang in the Chief Executive election, while Albert Cheng was seen as Tsang&#x27;s friend in the Legislative Council. Tsang also appointed some members from the pan-democracy camp to the government positions, including Lau Sai-leung to the Central Policy Unit which drew the criticism from the traditional Beijing-loyalists. On 30 August 2005, Tsang announced that the Guangdong Provincial Government invited all 60 members from the legislative council to visit Guangdong between 25 and 26 September 2005. This was the first chance for most of the pro-democrats such as Martin Lee to visit the mainland China since 1989.

The Tsang administration&#x27;s relationship with the pan-democrats deteriorated after the pro-democrats&#x27; rejection of the constitutional reform package in December 2005. Bounded by the decision by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee in 2004 which ruled out the 2007/2008 Chief Executive and Legislative Council universal suffrage, the Tsang administration put forward a reform package which would expand the 800-member Election Committee to 1,600 members and add 10 seats to the 2008 Legislative Council, with five directly elected through geographical constituencies and five functional constituencies elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was the best deal they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict. The proposal failed to gain two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council with four votes short, as 24 pan-democrats vetoed it. He angered democrats, who voted down his proposals, when he referred to them as &quot;horrid animals&quot;.

====Action Blue Sky Campaign====
In mid-2006 Tsang launched the &quot;Action Blue Sky Campaign&quot; and outlined a comprehensive plan to tackle air pollution in Hong Kong and in collaboration with the neighbouring Guangdong. Scepticism however remained among the expatriate and local population of Hong Kong and, in late November 2006, they ridiculed Tsang for citing the long life expectancy of Hong Kong residents as evidence of Hong Kong&#x27;s high quality of life relative to other major cities in the East Asian region.

===2007 re-election===

Tsang announced he would seek for the second term on 1 February 2007 with the campaign slogan &quot;I&#x27;ll get the job done&quot;. He submitted his nomination on 16 February, with 641 of the 796 Election Committee members nominated him which guaranteed his electoral victory before the polling day. He faced challenge from the pan-democrats who backed Civic Party legislator Alan Leong to run against him.

Tsang was elected by the 796-member Election Committee on 25 March 2007 with 649 votes, compared to Leong&#x27;s 123 votes. It was seen as the first competitive Chief Executive election featuring two candidates from different political camp with debates held between the candidates which changed Hong Kong&#x27;s political culture.

===Second term (2007–12)===
====Five-year policy blueprint====

Following his re-election as the Chief Executive in 2007, Tsang set out the 5-year blueprint for the third term of the SAR government in his 2007–08 policy address. He stressed the importance of &quot;progressive development&quot;, a core element of which is the promotion of community development through revitalisation of the built heritage in the city which is to be realised by promoting economic development through infrastructure projects. Ten large-scale infrastructure projects were also proposed within his term of office to boost economic activities to improve the living environment in Hong Kong: (1) MTR Southern District Extension; (2) MTR Sha Tin to Central Link; (3) Tuen Mun Western Bypass and Tuen Mun–Chek Lap Kok Link; (4) Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link; (5) Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge; (6) Hong Kong-Shenzhen Airport Co-operation; (7) Hong Kong-Shenzhen Joint Development of the Lok Ma Chau Loop; (8) West Kowloon Cultural District; (9) Kai Tak Development Plan; and (10) New Development Areas at Kwu Tung North, Fanling North, Ping Che and Ta Kwu Ling and Hung Shui Kiu.

====Heritage conservation====
The Tsang administration embattled with the conservation movement which reach its peak in the late 2000s, including the protests against the demolitions of the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen&#x27;s Pier. In response to it, Tsang set up a Commissioner for Heritage Office and earmarked $1 billion to revitalise historic buildings. He also proposed a series of revitalisation projects that would add a new dimension to Central. For instance, to reduce the development density of the Central Ferry Piers site and open up the public space along the waterfront for entertainment, recreational and cultural uses; to remove the Central Market from the Application List and hand it over to the Urban Renewal Authority for conservation and revitalisation; and to convert the Murray Building into a hotel through open tender etc.

====Political Appointments System====

In 2008, the Tsang administration introduced the Political Appointments System, by superseding the Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS) and inserting two layers of politically appointed officials below the secretaries, who are political appointees. The appointees&#x27; foreign nationalities, experience and remuneration levels, and transparency of the selection process were widely criticism by the public, which led to Tsang to offer a public apology, saying: &quot;With hindsight, I admit the arrangements in this regard did not fully meet public expectations, and I apologise for the controversy this has caused.&quot; The controversy became the turning point of the popularity of the Tsang government. A poll showed Tsang&#x27;s popularity declining sharply following the three-week row over the introduction of the Political Appointments System; his disapproval rating rose from 18% to a record 24%, while his approval rating declined from 66% to 60.8% in the space of three weeks. His approval/disapproval rating continued to deteriorate, and stood at 39/41% as at late August 2008.

====Great Recession====
After Great Recession led to a steep rise in unemployment especially among the banking and finance industries, Tsang announced on 8 December 2008 to create 60,000 jobs in 2009 by speeding up infrastructure projects and a ten-fold increase in its loan guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Tsang government also quickly formed a Task Force on Economic Challenges to deal with the recession. Tsang came up with six economic sectors to explore with the recommendations of the Task Force in his 2009–10 policy address: (1) testing and certification, (2) medical services, (3) innovation and technology, (4) cultural and creative industries, (5) environmental industry, and (6) educational services. The government pledged to provide more concrete support in those sectors and called them as the &quot;new economic pillars&quot;. After a year of negative record of GDP growth rate, the Hong Kong economy recovered quickly from 2010, despite the poverty population keep growing under Tsang tenure.

==== Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link ====

In 2009, the government proposal of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link Hong Kong section sparked concerns over the significant cost escalations compared to estimates made one year previously, the conservation of the Choi Yuen village and the increasing Mainland–Hong Kong integration. The government&#x27;s plan drew more than 10,000 people protesting against the construction of the rail link in late 2009 and early 2010. Despite the controversy and strong opposition from the community, the Executive Council approved the implementation on 20 October 2009. Appropriations for the project of $64 billion were passed by the Legislative Council on 16 January 2010 with the objections of the pro-democracy legislators.

====2012 constitutional reform====
The Tsang administration launched the proposals for electoral reform for the 2012 Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections in November 2009 which largely similar to the 2005 proposals. To oppose the proposal, five pan-democrat legislators resigned from the Legislative Council to trigger a territory-wide by-election in which they campaigned as the &quot;Five Constituencies Referendum&quot; for universal suffrage and the abolition of the functional constituencies.

Following the by-election, the government stepped up efforts to gain support for the reform package. It commissioned two television advertisements which emphasised the need to move forwards with democratisation. Tsang began to campaign via radio interviews, and he and his ministers took to the streets to mobilise support. On the weekend of 29/30 May, Tsang and his ministers toured Hong Kong on an unpublicised itinerary to deliver flyers and meet the public. Tsang described as &quot;myths&quot; which surrounded the proposals – that it is regressive, it makes little difference whether it is passed or not, and that ordinary people are not concerned by political developments. He said they were &quot;the first step as well as the last opportunity&quot; to lay the foundation for a chief executive elected by universal suffrage in 2017. He expressed his fear that &quot;a mood of pessimism and cynicism will take root&quot; if there was no progress this time. Tsang also invited Audrey Eu of the Civic Party, the spokesperson of the &quot;Five Constituencies Referendum&quot; to a one-hour televised debate on 17 June. Pundits were unanimous that Eu had trounced Tsang in the debate, with the University of Hong Kong poll showed that 45% of people were &quot;more opposed&quot; to the government&#x27;s proposals after the debate, while 20% said they were more supportive.

The central government made a U-turn on the moderate democrats&#x27; modified proposal tabled by the Democratic Party on 19 June, after &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; (SCMP) revealed that Donald Tsang had written a letter the previous week to Xi Jinping, vice-president in charge of Hong Kong affairs. &quot;The chief executive warned in the letter that Hong Kong could face a serious governance crisis if the electoral reform package was vetoed by Legco again, and his ability to govern Hong Kong effectively would be in doubt&quot;. The SCMP source said Chinese Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao personally approved the Democratic Party&#x27;s proposals. With the moderate democrats&#x27; support, the proposals were approved by the Legislative Council, making it the first and only electoral reform to be passed in the SAR history.

====Minimum Wage legislation====
Facing the increasing disparity between rich and poor in his term, Tsang set up a Minimum Wage Provisional Commission in February 2009 to research and eventually set a proposed wage floor. The Minimum Wage Bill was passed on 15 July 2010 and a HK$28 (~US$3.60) per hour rate was recommended by the Provisional Minimum Wage Commission and adopted by the Chief Executive-in-Council on 10 November 2010.

====Corruption allegations====
In the last months of his tenure, Tsang was embroiled in a series of corruption allegations. In February 2012 during the Chief Executive election in which contender Henry Tang, the former Chief Secretary in Tsang&#x27;s government suffered in wide range of scandals, Tsang was also discovered by the &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; to have received favours and hospitality from business tycoons on various occasions, including private jet and yacht trips and was labelled as &quot;Greedy Tsang&quot;.

The allegations of preferential allocation of a luxury three-storey penthouse in Shenzhen surfaced after Tsang addressed the press by saying that he and his wife had chosen to live in Shenzhen for a period after his retirement as they wanted to stay away from the limelight. Tsang was accused for allocating the Shenzhen penthouse owned by Bill Wong Cho-bau to Tsang in exchange for granting of a broadcasting licence to the Wong&#x27;s Digital Broadcasting Corporation (DBC, then Wave Media). It was reported that Tsang was set to rent the flat at a substantially discounted rate while renovation works, provided by the developer, were tailored to the demands of Tsang&#x27;s wife. Tsang argued that declaration was not necessary and that his lease did not affect the government&#x27;s decision on granting the broadcasting licence to DBC. He also argued that the lease was at market value.

Tsang was later summoned to answer questions from an open inquiry by the Legislative Council. This unprecedented revelations and move to impeach him launched by a pro-Beijing legislator Paul Tse shook the confidence in integrity of the city&#x27;s officials. Tsang also set up an Independent Review Committee for the Prevention and Handling of Potential Conflicts of Interests chaired by former Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Andrew Li on 26 February 2012 to review the existing frameworks and procedures for preventing and handling of potential conflicts of interests concerning the Chief Executive and other top officials.

In the last month of his office, Tsang fought back tears as he offered &quot;sincere apologies&quot; on 1 June, when he said: &quot;I know that my mishandling of the various events has undermined the community&#x27;s confidence in the integrity of the system and has disappointed my colleagues in the civil service. For this I would like to, once again, offer my sincere apologies.&quot; He stepped down as the Chief Executive on 30 June 2012 under the cloud of an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Compared to his predecessor Tung Chee-hwa who was appointed vice-chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) after stepping down as Chief Executive, Tsang was not appointed any position by the central government after his retirement.

==Conviction, imprisonment, and acquittal==
On 5 October 2015, Tsang was charged with two counts of misconduct in public office after failing to disclose plans to rent a luxury penthouse for his retirement from Bill Wong Cho-bau applying for a broadcasting licence for the Digital Broadcasting Corporation (then Wave Media) by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), as well as failing to declare renowned interior designer Barrie Ho Chow-lai&#x27;s engagement for decorating the penthouse when he recommended to the relevant government committee that Ho should receive an honour. An extra count of accepting an advantage from an agent for violating the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance over the Shenzhen penthouse was added on 11 October 2016.

After entering pleas of not guilty to all charges, his trial began before a jury on 10 January 2017. On 17 February 2017, the jury found Tsang guilty on one charge of misconduct in public office over the penthouse rental and not guilty on the misconduct charge for the penthouse decoration, but failed to reach a verdict on the count of accepting an advantage from an agent. He was sentenced to a 20-month imprisonment on 22 February 2017. When he announced Tsang&#x27;s sentence, Mr Justice Andrew Chan Hing-wai said &quot;never in my judicial career have I seen a man fallen from so high.&quot;

On 24 April, Tsang granted bail by court after his health was fluctuating and had to be sent to the Queen Mary Hospital. Regarding the charge which had a guilty verdict, Tsang gets bail pending appeal. Regarding the charge which &quot;failed to reach a verdict&quot;, a retrial was carried out, and the Judge dismissed the retrial-jury on 3 November 2017 after they too were unable to reach a verdict. Prosecution has not applied for a third trial.

On 11 January 2019, Tsang was admitted to hospital for health reasons, a few days ahead of his scheduled release from prison. On 15 January, Tsang was released from hospital and also from jail. Upon his release, Tsang refused to compare his case with that of his successor Leung Chun-ying, who was also accused of corruption for his recipient of HK$50 million from Australian firm UGL without disclosure, even though Leung&#x27;s case was dropped by the government in a controversial manner. &quot;If I make comparisons, it may revive my anger and hatred in my heart. I have cleared these through working hard to pray and receive blessings from the heavens a few months ago,&quot; Tsang said. He also said he would persist in seeking justice and clear his name.

On 26 June 2019, the Court of Final Appeal unanimously quashed his conviction and sentence, after finding that the trial judge had failed to direct his jurors properly. The Court found that the trial court trial did not adequately instruct the jury on required elements of the crime. Since Tsang was not convicted for bribery, the elements of &quot;wilfulness&quot; and &quot;seriousness&quot; in the misconduct in public office charge became especially important, and an adequate explanation was not given to the jury. The Court also decided that the interests of justice did not require a new trial.

As a result of his successful appeal, Tsang should be able to reclaim some of the estimated HK$40 to 50 million of legal costs over two trials and two appeals. Tsang had said he and his wife spent almost all their savings on the lawsuit. But Tsang is unlikely to reclaim his costs fully, including the initial trial and legal costs related to his investigation. Another outcome of the appeal is that Tsang&#x27;s entitlement to HK$80,000 a month in civil servants&#x27; pension will no longer be in jeopardy. Retired Hong Kong civil servants could lose all or part of their pension if they were convicted of an offence related to their office, subject to the chief executive&#x27;s approval.

==Personal life==

Tsang is the eldest of the five sons and one daughter. His younger brother Tsang Yam-pui, retired as the Police Commissioner in December 2003, after a career with the police in which he worked his way up to the top job from the rank of Probationary Inspector. His younger sister Katherine Tsang is chairperson of Standard Chartered Hong Kong. He married Selina Pou Siu-mei in 1969 and has two sons, Simon Tsang Hing-yin and Thomas Tsang Hing-shun.

Tsang is a devout Roman Catholic and goes to Mass every morning, though his political viewpoints were bluntly criticised at times by Joseph Cardinal Zen, who was the Bishop of Hong Kong during Tsang&#x27;s term as Chief Executive.

Tsang is well known for his preference of wearing bow-ties. According to Associated Press, &quot;the bow tie is such an integral part of Tsang&#x27;s identity that he is nicknamed &quot;Bow-tie Tsang&quot;. His nickname is widely known among Hong Kong people. According to a television interview, this preference started somewhere between 1988 and 1993, when Tsang&#x27;s office was adjacent to Deputy Political Adviser Stephen Bradley, who himself wore bow-ties. Tsang felt comfortable with a bow-tie Bradley gave him, saying that its design brings fewer hurdles to its wearer than a necktie.

Tsang is well known for keeping koi. He had a pond built for them in the garden of his official residence, Government House, at a cost of HK$300,000. His other hobbies include swimming, bird-watching and hiking.

<text>Trend Records was a post-World War II United States jazz record label.

Trend&#x27;s back catalogue was purchased by Albert Marx, an authority on jazz music and entrepreneur who founded Discovery Records in 1948, and much of its material was reissued in the 1980s. Among those who recorded for Trend are Van Alexander, Robert Conti, Shelly Manne, Clare Fischer, Dick Berk, Matt Dennis and Ray Linn.

==Background==
Two men that were connected with the label were former Discovery Records chief, Albert Marx and a wealthy construction and oil man, Paul W. Trousdale.

The label in its early days had the intent of releasing jazz, r&amp;b, standards, western melodies and novelties. They were handling all the main formats at the time, 45s, 78s and long play records.

One of the groups that was signed to the label was the Dave Pell Octet. Albert Marx came to one of their rehearsals. Dave Pell recalled in an interview decades later that Marx flipped when he heard them and the ensemble was soon recording for the label.

==History==
It was mentioned in the April 18, 1953 issue of &quot;The Billboard&quot; that the label had released its first record which was a novelty. The record was &quot;Wang Wang Blues&quot; backed with &quot;Somebody Stole My Gal&quot;. The recordings featured &quot;Gus Meuller, Buster Johnson, Leo Wood and Henry Busse. Jerry Feilding who had recently signed to the label was set to release an LP album of standards.

In late 1953, the Ernie Andrews release, “Make Me A Present of You” and “Don’t Lead Me On” were getting a good amount of airplay in the Los Angeles region, and there were predictions of them having hit potential. By January 1954, the record was reportedly making big sales throughout the US and Al Marx was on a promotional tour throughout the East. The record was a boost to Andrews&#x27; career with him now a popular nightclub attraction. Not only had it broken wide into r&amp;b but it was also doing well in pop and getting a good amount of juke box play. The Lancers were also doing well with their release, &quot;Peggy O&#x27;Neil&quot; bw &quot;Stop Chasin&#x27; Me Baby&quot; which was released on Trend 70.

According to the 78RPM Club, label went bankrupt in March, 1955. With Kapp Records purchasing their catalogue in February 1956. It&#x27;s likely that the label with its good catalogue wasn&#x27;t meeting the expectations of Paul W Trousdale. Being the major investor, he decided to sell the label in the spring of 1955. In February 1956, Dave Kapp of Kapp Records purchased the label for a healthy five figure amount. Following the sale, Albert Marx had a short career in management and had signed up singer Johnny Holiday as the first on his roster. Dave Pell who had recorded for the label had already signed an exclusive deal with Atlantic in April 1955.

It appears that Ben Hurwitz was involved with the legacy of the label, and the name was changed to Prime Records in 1966.

==Later years==
Paul W. Trousdale died in Santa Barbara, California in April 1990 at age 75.

<doc id="336784" wikidata="Q494691" url="?curid=336784" title="Cayuse people">
<text>The Cayuse are a Native American tribe in what is now the state of Oregon in the United States. The Cayuse tribe shares a reservation and government in northeastern Oregon with the Umatilla and the Walla Walla tribes as part of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. The reservation is located near Pendleton, Oregon, at the base of the Blue Mountains.

The Cayuse called themselves the Liksiyu in the Cayuse language. Originally located in present-day northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, they lived adjacent to territory occupied by the Nez Perce and had close associations with them. Like the Plains tribes, the Cayuse placed a high premium on warfare and were skilled horsemen. They developed the Cayuse pony. The Cayuse ceded most of their traditional territory to the United States in 1855 by treaty and moved to the Umatilla Reservation, where they have formed a confederated tribe.

==History==
According to Haruo Aoki (1998), the Cayuse called themselves &quot;Liksiyu&quot; in their language. Their name &quot;Cayuse&quot; was derived from the French word &quot;cailloux,&quot; meaning stones or rocks, adopted by early French Canadian trappers of the area. The name may have referred to the rocky area the tribe inhabited, or it may have been an imprecise rendering of the name they called themselves. The tribe has been closely associated with the neighboring Nez Percé and Walla Walla. The Cayuse language is an isolate, independent of the neighboring Sahaptin-speaking peoples. The Cayuse population was about 500 in the eighteenth century.

The Cayuse were a seminomadic tribe and maintained summer and winter villages on the Snake, Tucannon, Walla Walla, and Touchet rivers in Washington, and along the Umatilla, Grand Ronde, Burnt, Powder, John Day River, and from the Blue Mountains to the Deschutes River in Oregon. Historian Verne Ray has identified seventy-six traditional Cayuse Village sites, most temporary, seasonal sites; five separate villages in the Walla Walla Valley and seven Cayuse Bands scattered throughout Eastern Oregon and Washington. The Walla Walla River Cayuse Band was called the &quot;Pa&#x27;cxapu&quot;. Other sources name only three distinct regional bands within the Cayuse at the time: two centered on the Umatilla River, and the third on the Walla Walla River.

The Cayuse were known for their bravery, and as horsemen. They bred their ponies for speed and endurance, developing what is now called the Cayuse horse. No longer restricted to what they could carry or what their dogs could pull, they moved into new areas, traveling as far east as the Great Plains and as far south as California, to hunt, trade, fight, and capture slaves. Meanwhile, their herds multiplied rapidly, a combination of skillful breeding and periodic raids on other tribes. By the early 1800s, a Cayuse who owned only 15 to 20 horses was considered poor; wealthy families controlled 2,000 or more. Horses improved the range and effectiveness of war parties, making it possible for Cayuses to dominate their sedentary neighbors on the Columbia. They claimed ownership of The Dalles, the great fishery and trade emporium of the Columbia, forcing the weaker bands in that area to pay them tribute in the form of salmon and other goods. They frequently were in conflict fighting with Piute, Shoshone, and Bannock Tribes to the south and east referred to as the Snake people and other tribes such as the Blackfeet over territory and hunting sites.

As white settlers moved into their territory in large numbers following the opening of the Oregon Trail in 1842, the Cayuse suffered. Even settlers passing through competed with them for game and water. Crowds of whites invaded the region during the California gold rush beginning in 1848 and when gold was discovered in Eastern Oregon in 1862.

The tribe gained wide notoriety in the early days of the white settlement of the territory. In 1838, Marcus Whitman and his wife Narcissa established a mission among the Cayuse at &quot;Waiilatpu&quot; (&quot;Place of the Rye Grass&quot;), a site about seven miles from the present-day city of Walla Walla and about a quarter mile east of where the Cayuse &quot;Pásxa&quot; winter village was located. In 1847, a measles epidemic, suspected by some to be contracted from white settlers, resulted in high fatalities among the tribe. A small group of Cayuse, after putting Witmans medicine to the test with both sick and non sick individuals, and which all test individuals died, believed the missionaries were deliberately poisoning their native people, since a much higher percentage of the natives were dying from the measles than were the whites. In addition, cultural differences and settler encroachment had caused growing tensions.

The Cayuse attacked the missionaries, killing Whitman and his wife Narcissa, and eleven others. They captured 54 European-American women and children and held them for ransom. They destroyed the mission buildings. This attack prompted an armed response by the United States and the Cayuse War ensued. Five Cayuse warriors were hanged; see Cayuse Five.

The Cayuse put the captives to work together with their members; the adults made clothing for the tribe. They released the hostages after the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company brokered an exchange of 62 blankets, 63 cotton shirts, 12 Hudson Bay rifles, 600 loads of ammunition, 7 pounds of tobacco and 12 flints for the return of the now 49 surviving prisoners. The Cayuse and many from other nearby tribes such as the Walla Walla Tribe were hunted down by Militias and massacred. The Cayuse eventually lost the war. They were forced to cede their land to the US and shared a reservation with the Umatilla and Walla Walla.

By 1851, the Cayuse had long intermarried with the neighboring Nez Percé, with whom they had sheltered; many learned their language. Kathleen Gordon, a Tribal member of the Confederate Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was a Cayuse/Nez Pierce Language instructor who spoke and taught the Nez Pierce language, but also knew small amounts of the Original Cayuse Language that is now extinct.

In 1855, the Cayuse joined the Treaty of Walla Walla with the Umatilla and Walla Walla by which the Umatilla Indian Reservation was formed. Since that time, they have officially resided within the reservation&#x27;s limits. During the mid-twentieth century, some members moved to cities under the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, an effort to give better access for contemporary jobs.

Their number was officially reported as 404 in 1904; this number may be misleading. A count in 1902 found one pure-blooded Cayuse on the reservation. Descendants with ancestry partially of the other tribes may still have identified as Cayuse. The Cayuse language is believed to have become extinct by then. As the members of the three tribes have intermarried, they no longer keep separate population numbers.

==Lifestyle==
The Cayuse Indians were located in the Columbia Basin and were nomadic, sometimes moving on a daily basis. They lived in teepees, which many nomadic tribes used for portability. The Cayuse were skilled horsemen, and used horses in hunting. They also used them for their trip over the Rocky Mountains each year to hunt a supply of buffalo to bring back for their families. The men hunted game and fished salmon. The women gathered and picked berries and dug and processed roots. The women also processed the animal skins to make materials for shelter and clothing. The men considered bravery to be an important quality, with brave warriors being held in high esteem. The strongest would be made chief.

==Language==

The Cayuse language is a language isolate and has been extinct since the 1930s. Weyíiletpuu was a dialect of the Nez Perce language spoken by the Cayuse inhabitants of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. It has not been used since the 1940s and is designated as extinct.

==Cuisine ==

One of the Cayuse&#x27;s main food sources was salmon from the Columbia River. Along with trout and lamprey, they also hunted elk and deer, as well as small game such as rabbits and fowl. Most significantly, women gathered camas roots, bitter roots, basket roots, wild celery, huckleberries and choke cherries, processing them for cooked and dried foods for their survival. They also gathered bark, leaves, flowers, and roots for making medicine.

==Notable Cayuse==
* Tawatoy (known as Young Chief), Head Chief, uncle and predecessor of the next Young Chief (&quot;Weatenatemany&quot;), was a well-known leader and warrior 
* Weatenatemany (also known as Young Chief, c.18??–1859), Head Chief, nephew of Tawatoy, became the new Young Chief in October 1853, leader of the more conciliatory faction of the Cayuse, killed in a skirmish with the Snake during the summer of 1859.
* Five Crows (also known as &quot;Achekaia&quot; or &quot;Hezekiah&quot;), brother and first successor of Tauitau, and leader of the hostile Cayuse, principal rival to Tauitau&#x27;s son Young Chief (Weatenatemany) for the role of Head Chief.

<doc id="336785" wikidata="Q489579" url="?curid=336785" title="George Lewis (clarinetist)">
<text>George Lewis (born Joseph Louis Francois Zenon; July 13, 1900 – December 31, 1968) was an American jazz clarinetist who achieved his highest profile in the later decades of his life.

==early life==
Lewis was born in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1900 and lived at 3327 De Armas Street in the Algiers section of New Orleans. Through his mother, Alice Zeno, his maternal great-great-grandmother was a Senegalese slave who was brought to Louisiana around 1803. Zeno&#x27;s family retained some knowledge of Senegalese language and customs until Alice&#x27;s generation.

==Personal==
George married Emma Zeno in 1918 in New Orleans they had four children, Mildred Zeno-Major; Joseph Zeno; William (Bill) Zeno; and George (Baby George).

==Musical career==
During the 1920s, he founded the New Orleans Stompers. In the decade he also worked with Chris Kelly, Buddy Petit, Kid Rena, and was a member of the Eureka Brass Band and the Olympia Orchestra. In the 1930s, he played with Bunk Johnson, De De Pierce, and Billie Pierce. He recorded with Johnson in the early 1940s and with Kid Shots Madison. Alan Lomax brought Lewis on a Rudi Blesh radio show in 1942 in which Lewis played &quot;Woodchopper&#x27;s Ball&quot; by Woody Herman.

Unable to earn enough money as a musician, he worked loading and unloading ships&#x27; cargo at docks of the Mississippi River. In 1944, Lewis was injured while working on the docks. A heavy container nearly crushed his chest. He practiced while convalescing in bed at his St. Phillips Street home in the French Quarter. His friends, banjoist Lawrence Marrero and double bassist Alcide Pavageau, brought their instruments to his bedside. Bill Russell brought his portable recorder and they recorded &quot;Burgundy Street Blues&quot;, improvised blues song that was to become the Lewis signature piece. As Russell recorded Lewis, he occasionally gave new titles to interpretations of pop tunes, such as &quot;New Orleans Hula&quot; for &quot;Hula Lou&quot;. These changes may have been made for copyright reasons, but occasionally it was because musicians reported the titles inaccurately to Russell.

Lewis stayed with Johnson&#x27;s band through 1946. This included a trip to New York City, where they played for dancing at the Stuyvesant Casino on Second Avenue. Band members included Johnson, Marrero, Pavageau, trombonist Jim Robinson, pianist Alton Purnell, and drummer Baby Dodds. While in New York, they recorded for Decca and Victor. After Johnson retired, Lewis took over leadership of the band, which included Robinson, Pavageau, Marrero, Purnell, Joe Watkins, and a succession of New Orleans trumpeters: Elmer Talbert, Kid Howard, and Percy Humphrey. Starting in 1949, Lewis was a regular on Bourbon Street clubs and radio station WDSU.

His band was profiled in the June 6, 1950, issue of &quot;Look&quot; magazine with photographs by Stanley Kubrick. His reputation grew and he became a leader of the New Orleans revival.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, his recordings reached the UK and influenced clarinetists Monty Sunshine and Acker Bilk. They became important contributors to the traditional jazz scene in the UK and accompanied Lewis when he toured the country.

Lewis visited England in 1957, playing throughout the country with Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazzmen. In 1959, he returned, this time with his full band, and received a warm response. In 1959, he visited Denmark and played at Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen.

Beginning in the 1960s, he played regularly at Preservation Hall in New Orleans as leader of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band until shortly before his death. His performances were painted by artists in the city. Sitting portraits by Noel Rockmore were sold to collectors. Rockwell painted several musicians who had performed at Preservation Hall.

Jazz critic Gary Giddins described Lewis as &quot;an affecting musician with a fat-boned sound but limited technique&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Lewis was Catholic. He died on December 31, 1968, from unknown causes.

<doc id="336787" wikidata="Q19083" url="?curid=336787" title="Kingdom of Iberia">
<text>In Greco-Roman geography, Iberia (Ancient Greek: &quot;Iberia&quot;; ; Parthian: ; Middle Persian: ) was an exonym for the Georgian kingdom of Kartli or kingdom of Iveria (Georgian: ქართლის სამეფო ან ივერიის სამეფო), known after its core province, which during Classical Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages was a monarchy in the Caucasus, either as an independent state or as a dependent of larger empires, notably the Sassanid and Roman empires. Iberia, centered on present-day Eastern Georgia, was bordered by Colchis in the west, Caucasian Albania in the east and Armenia in the south.

Its population, the Iberians (Iverians), formed the nucleus of the Kartvelians (i.e. Georgians). Iberia, ruled by the Pharnavazid, Artaxiad, Arsacid and Chosroid royal dynasties, together with Colchis to its west, would form the nucleus of the unified medieval Kingdom of Georgia under the Bagrationi dynasty.

In the 4th century, after the Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino during the reign of King Mirian III, Christianity was made the state religion of the kingdom. Starting in the early 6th century AD, the kingdom&#x27;s position as a Sassanian vassal state was changed into direct Persian rule. In 580, king Hormizd IV (578–590) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III, and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a &quot;marzpan&quot; (governor).

The term &quot;Caucasian Iberia&quot; is also used to distinguish it from the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe.

==Name==

All exonyms are likely derived from (), the Persian designation of the Georgians, evolving from Parthian () and Middle Persian (), rooting out from Old Persian () meaning &quot;the land of the wolves&quot;. This is also reflected in Old Armenian (), it being a source of Ancient Greek (), that entered Latin as . The transformation of into and alteration of v into g was a phonetic phenomenon in the word formation of Proto-Aryan and ancient Iranian languages. All exonyms are simply phonetic variations of the same root &quot;vrk/varka&quot; () meaning wolf.

Historian argues that the name &quot;Iberian&quot; was given by Ancient Greeks to two different peoples located at the extremities of their world (in the Iberian Peninsula and the Caucasus) due to the mythical wealth associated with them (Tartessos and the Golden Fleece of Colchis).

==History==

===Early history===

In earliest times, the area of Caucasian Iberia was inhabited by several related tribes stemming from the Kura-Araxes culture.

According to the Cyril Toumanoff, Moschians were the early proto-Georgian tribe which played a leading role in the consolidation of Iberian tribes largely inhabiting eastern and southern Georgia. The Moschians may have moved slowly to the northeast forming settlements as they traveled. One of these was Mtskheta, the future capital of the Kingdom of Iberia. The Mtskheta tribe was later ruled by a prince locally known as &quot;mamasakhlisi&quot; (“father of the household” in Georgian).

The written sources for the early periods of Iberia&#x27;s history are mostly medieval Georgian chronicles, that modern scholarship interpret as a semi-legendary narrative. One such chronicle, &quot;Moktsevay Kartlisay&quot; (“Conversion of Kartli”) mentions that a ruler named Azo and his people came from Arian-Kartli – the initial home of the proto-Iberians, which had been under Achaemenid rule until the fall of the Persian Empire – and settled on the site where Mtskheta was to be founded. Another Georgian chronicle, &quot;Kartlis Tskhovreba&quot; (“History of Kartli”) claims Azo to be an officer of Alexander’s, who massacred a local ruling family and conquered the area, until being defeated at the end of the 4th century BC by Prince Pharnavaz, at that time a local chief.

The story of Alexander&#x27;s invasion of Kartli, although legendary, nevertheless reflects the establishment of Georgian monarchy in the Hellenistic period and the desire of later Georgian literati to connect this event to the celebrated conqueror.

===Pharnavaz I and his descendants===
Pharnavaz, victorious in a power struggle, became the first king of Iberia (c. 302 – c. 237 BC). According to the later Georgian chronicles, after driving back an invasion, he subjugated the neighboring areas, including a significant part of the western Georgian state of Colchis (locally known as Egrisi), and seems to have secured recognition of the newly founded state by the Seleucids of Syria. Pharnavaz is also said to have built a major citadel, the Armaztsikhe, and a temple to the god Armazi, and to have created a new system of administration, subdividing the country into several counties called &quot;saeristavos&quot;.

His successors controlled the mountain passes of the Caucasus, with the Daryal (also known as the Iberian Gates) being the most important of them.

The period following this time of prosperity was one of incessant warfare as Iberia was forced to defend against numerous invasions into its territories. Some southern parts of Iberia, that were conquered from the Kingdom of Armenia, in the 2nd century BC were reunited to Armenia and the Colchian lands seceded to form separate princedoms (&quot;sceptuchoi&quot;). At the end of the 2nd century BC, the Pharnavazid king Pharnajom was dethroned by his own subjects, after converting to Zoroastrianism, and the crown given to the Armenian prince Artaxias who ascended the Iberian throne in 93 BC, establishing the Artaxiad dynasty of Iberia.

===Roman period and Roman/Parthian rivalry===

This close association with Armenia and Pontus brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC) by the Roman general Pompey, who was then at war with Mithradates VI of Pontus, and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Twenty-nine years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King Pharnavaz II to join their campaign against Albania.

While another Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, Iberia freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at Mtskheta speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58–106) as &quot;the friend of the Caesars&quot; and the king &quot;of the Roman-loving Iberians.&quot; Emperor Vespasian fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in AD 75.

The next two centuries saw a continuation of Roman influence over the area, but by the reign of King Pharsman II (116–132) Iberia had regained some of its former power. Relations between the Roman Emperor Hadrian and Pharsman II were strained, though Hadrian is said to have sought to appease Pharsman. However, it was only under Hadrian&#x27;s successor Antoninus Pius that relations improved to the extent that Pharsman is said to have even visited Rome, where Dio Cassius reports that a statue was erected in his honor and that rights to sacrifice were given. The period brought a major change to the political status of Iberia with Rome recognizing them as an ally, rather than their former status as a subject state, a political situation which remained the same, even during the Empire&#x27;s hostilities with the Parthians.

From the first centuries of the Christian era, the cult of Mithras and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Iberia. Excavation of rich burials in Bori, Armazi, and Zguderi has produced silver drinking cups with the impression of a horse either standing at a fire-altar or with its right foreleg raised above the altar. The cult of Mithras, distinguished by its syncretic character and thus complementary to local cults within Georgian mythology, especially the cult of the Sun, gradually came to merge with ancient Georgian beliefs. It is even thought that Mithras must have been the precursor of St. George in pagan Georgia. Step by step, Iranian beliefs and ways of life penetrated deeply the practices of the Iberian court and elite: the Armazian script and “language,” which is based on Aramaic (see Tsereteli), was adopted officially (a number of inscriptions in Aramaic of the Classical/Hellenistic periods are known from Colchis as well); the court was organized on Iranian models, the elite dress was influenced by Iranian costume, the Iberian elite adopted Iranian personal names, and the official cult of Armazi (q.v.) was introduced by King Pharnavaz in the 3rd century BC (connected by the medieval Georgian chronicle to Zoroastrianism)

===Between Rome/Byzantium and Persia===

Decisive for the future history of Iberia was the foundation of the Sasanian (or Sassanid) Empire in 224 by Ardashir I. By replacing the weak Parthian realm with a strong, centralized state, it changed the political orientation of Iberia away from Rome. Iberia became a tributary of the Sasanian state during the reign of Shapur I (241–272). Relations between the two countries seem to have been friendly at first, as Iberia cooperated in Persian campaigns against Rome, and the Iberian king Amazasp III (260–265) was listed as a high dignitary of the Sasanian realm, not a vassal who had been subdued by force of arms. But the aggressive tendencies of the Sasanians were evident in their propagation of Zoroastrianism, which was probably established in Iberia between the 260s and 290s.

However, in the Peace of Nisibis (298) while the Roman empire obtained control of Caucasian Iberia again as a vassal state and acknowledged the reign over all the Caucasian area, it recognized Mirian III, the first of the Chosroid dynasty, as king of Iberia.

===Adoption of Christianity and Sassanid Persian period===

Roman predominance proved crucial in religious matters, since King Mirian III and leading nobles converted to Christianity around 317 and declared as state religion. The event is related with the mission of a Cappadocian woman, Saint Nino, who since 303 had preached Christianity in the Georgian kingdom of Iberia (Eastern Georgia).

The religion would become a strong tie between Georgia and Rome (later Byzantium) and have a large scale impact on the state&#x27;s culture and society. Iranian elements in Georgian art gradually ceased with the adoptation of Christianity in the fourth century.

However, after the emperor Julian was slain during his failed campaign in Persia in 363, Rome ceded control of Iberia to Persia, and King Varaz-Bakur I (Asphagur) (363–365) became a Persian vassal, an outcome confirmed by the Peace of Acilisene in 387. However, a later ruler of Kartli, Pharsman IV (406–409), preserved his country&#x27;s autonomy and ceased to pay tribute to Persia. Persia prevailed, and Sassanian kings began to appoint a viceroy (&quot;pitiaxae&quot;/&quot;bidaxae&quot;) to keep watch on their vassal. They eventually made the office hereditary in the ruling house of Lower Kartli, thus inaugurating the Kartli &quot;pitiaxate&quot;, which brought an extensive territory under its control. Although it remained a part of the kingdom of Kartli, its viceroys turned their domain into a center of Persian influence. Sasanian rulers put the Christianity of the Georgians to a severe test. They promoted the teachings of Zoroaster, and by the middle of the 5th century Zoroastrianism had become a second official religion in eastern Georgia alongside Christianity.

The early reign of the Iberian king Vakhtang I dubbed &quot;Gorgasali&quot; (447–502) was marked by the relative revival of the kingdom. Formally a vassal of the Persians, he secured the northern borders by subjugating the Caucasian mountaineers, and brought the adjacent western and southern Georgian lands under his control. He established an autocephalic patriarchate at Mtskheta, and made Tbilisi his capital. In 482 he led a general uprising against Persia and started a desperate war for independence that lasted for twenty years. He could not get Byzantine support and was eventually defeated, dying in battle in 502.

===Fall of the kingdom===
The continuing rivalry between Byzantium and Sasanian Persia for supremacy in the Caucasus, and the next unsuccessful insurrection (523) of the Georgians under Gurgen had severe consequences for the country. Thereafter, the king of Iberia had only nominal power, while the country was effectively ruled by the Persians. In 580, Hormizd IV (578–590) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bacurius III of Iberia, and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a &quot;marzpan&quot; (governor). Georgian nobles urged the Byzantine emperor Maurice to revive the kingdom of Iberia in 582, but in 591 Byzantium and Persia agreed to divide Iberia between them, with Tbilisi to be in Persian hands and Mtskheta to be under Byzantine control.

At the beginning of the 7th century, the truce between Byzantium and Persia collapsed. The Iberian prince Stephan I (c. 590 – 627), decided in 607 to join forces with Persia in order to reunite all the territories of Iberia, a goal he seems to have accomplished. But Emperor Heraclius&#x27;s offensive in 627 and 628 brought victory over the Georgians and Persians and ensured Byzantine predominance in western and eastern Georgia until the invasion of the Caucasus by the Arabs.

===Arab period and restoration of the kingship===

The Arabs reached Iberia about 645 and forced its eristavi (prince), Stephanoz II (637 – c. 650), to abandon his allegiance to Byzantium and recognize the Caliph as his suzerain. Iberia thus became a tributary state and an Arab emir was installed in Tbilisi about 653. At the beginning of the 9th century, eristavi Ashot I (813–830) of the new Bagrationi dynasty, from his base in southwestern Georgia, took advantage of the weakening of the Arab rule to establish himself as hereditary prince (with the Byzantine title &quot;kouropalates&quot;) of Iberia. A successor, Adarnase IV of Iberia, formally a vassal of Byzantium, was crowned as the “king of Iberia” in 888. His descendant Bagrat III (r. 975–1014), brought the various principalities together to form a united Georgian monarchy.

==Eastern and Western Iberians==
The similarity of the name with the old inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, the &#x27;Western&#x27; Iberians, has led to an idea of ethnogenetical kinship between them and the people of Caucasian Iberia (called the &#x27;Eastern&#x27; Iberians).

It has been advocated by various ancient and medieval authors, although they differed in approach to the problem of the initial place of their origin. The theory seems to have been popular in medieval Georgia. The prominent Georgian religious writer George the Hagiorite (1009–1065) wrote about the wish of certain Georgian nobles to travel to the Iberian peninsula and visit the local &quot;Georgians of the West&quot;, as he called them.

<text>Madeleine Stowe (born August 18, 1958) is an American actress. She appeared mostly on television before her role in the 1987 crime-comedy film &quot;Stakeout&quot;. She went on to star in the films &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990), &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot; (1992), &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), &quot;Blink&quot; (1993), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999), and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; (2002). For her role in the 1993 independent film &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, she won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress.

From 2011 to 2015, Stowe starred as Victoria Grayson, the main antagonist of the ABC drama series &quot;Revenge&quot;. For this role, she was nominated for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.

==Early life==
Stowe, the first of three children, was born at the Queen of Angels Hospital, in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Eagle Rock, a section of Los Angeles. Her father, Robert Stowe, was a civil engineer from Oregon, while her mother, Mireya (née Mora Steinvorth), came from a prominent family in Costa Rica. One of Stowe&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfathers, politician José Joaquín Mora Porras, was a younger brother of President Juan Rafael Mora Porras, who governed Costa Rica from 1849 to 1859. Another maternal great-great-grandfather, Bruno Carranza, was briefly President of that country in 1870 (he resigned three months after taking office); his wife, Stowe&#x27;s great-great-grandmother Gerónima Montealegre, was the sister of President José María Montealegre Fernández, who governed Costa Rica from 1859 to 1863, and himself the son of his country&#x27;s first Vice Head of State Mariano Montealegre Bustamante, himself the half brother of Mariano Montealegre y Romero, the founder of the Montealegre family branch in Nicaragua.

Stowe&#x27;s father suffered from multiple sclerosis, and she accompanied him to all his medical treatments. She originally aspired to become a concert pianist, taking lessons between the ages of ten and eighteen. She later explained that playing the piano was a means to escape having to socialize with other children her age. Her Ukrainian-born music teacher, Sergei Tarnowsky, had faith in Stowe, even teaching her from his deathbed. Following his death at the age of 92, she quit, later commenting, &quot;I just felt it was time to not be by myself anymore.&quot;

==Acting career==

===Early years===
Not being especially interested in her college classes, she volunteered to do performances at the &quot;Solaris&quot;, a Beverly Hills theater, where a movie agent saw her in a play and got her several offers of appearances in TV and films. In 1978, she made her debut in an episode in the police drama series &quot;Baretta&quot;, followed by a string of TV work with guest appearances on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; and &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. In 1978, she played a leading role as Mary in the television movie, &quot;The Nativity&quot; (1978). She starred in two NBC miniseries: &quot;Beulah Land&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Gangster Chronicles&quot; (1981), which starred Brian Benben, her future husband. She also starred in several television films, such as &quot;Amazons&quot; (1984) and &quot;Blood &amp; Orchids&quot; (1986). In 1984, she was featured in the music video for JD Souther&#x27;s song Go Ahead And Rain.

===Breakthrough and film career===
In 1987, Stowe appeared in her first breakthrough role in the feature film &quot;Stakeout&quot; with Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez. The film debuted at No.1 at the box office. In 1988, she played a leading role in Ciro Durán&#x27;s film &quot;Tropical Snow&quot;, with David Carradine. She co-starred with Mark Harmon in the comedy &quot;Worth Winning&quot;, with Kevin Costner in the 1989 thriller &quot;Revenge&quot;, and opposite Jack Nicholson in 1990 in &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;. She played a leading role in the 1991 independent film &quot;Closet Land&quot;.

In 1992, she appeared opposite Kurt Russell in the crime drama &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot;. That same year, Stowe played Cora Munro in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, which also starred Daniel Day-Lewis. Her critically acclaimed performance in the film, which grossed more than $75 million worldwide, elevated Stowe from supporting player to an A-list movie star. The next year, director Robert Altman cast Stowe in the award-winning ensemble cast movie &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, where she gave one of her most acclaimed screen performances as the wife of a compulsively lying and adulterous police officer played by Tim Robbins. She won the National Society of Film Critics Awards for Best Supporting Actress, a Golden Globe Award and a Volpi Cup for Best Ensemble Cast for her performance in the movie. She also made a cameo appearance in &quot;Stakeout&quot; sequel &quot;Another Stakeout&quot;. The following year, Stowe played a leading role as a blind musician in the thriller &quot;Blink&quot;, in the neo-noir thriller &quot;China Moon&quot;, and in the Western &quot;Bad Girls&quot;. The year after that, she was a sympathetic psychiatrist in the financially successful and critically lauded science-fiction movie &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;. Stowe received a Saturn Awards nomination for this performance. 

In 1994 Stowe was named one of People magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;. In 1995, Stowe was chosen by &quot;Empire&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot;.

Stowe postponed her acting career in 1996 to concentrate on her family life. She settled for several years in a Texas ranch, with her daughter May and husband Brian Benben. In 1998, she came back with &quot;The Proposition&quot; and &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;, and then &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, opposite John Travolta in 1999. In 2001, she starred in the science-fiction box office bomb &quot;Impostor&quot;. In 2002, she played Julia Moore in the war film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; with Mel Gibson, and the box office flop action-comedy &quot;Avenging Angelo&quot; opposite Sylvester Stallone. In 2003, she starred in the thriller &quot;Octane&quot; as Senga Wilson, a single mother trying to save her teenage daughter (Mischa Barton) from a bizarre cult obsessed with blood and cars.

===Recent years===
Stowe&#x27;s onscreen appearances became increasingly rare in the 2000s, as she focused on motherhood. She later stated in an interview : &quot;I never thought, &#x27;I&#x27;m retiring,&#x27; but I didn&#x27;t feel that &#x27;thing&#x27; revving in me. I was much more focused on May. It was frustrating at times, but now I see how she&#x27;s turned out, I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.&quot; She occasionally appeared in some TV productions, such as &quot;Saving Milly&quot;, an adaptation of Morton Kondracke&#x27;s book of the same name, of a woman diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Stowe starred in the not-picked-up Fox pilot &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; about a woman who takes over her mobster husband&#x27;s business when he gets sent to prison. In 2007, she appeared in the recurring role of Dr. Samantha Kohl in Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s detective drama &quot;Raines&quot; on NBC, a mid-season replacement. The series was canceled after two months. In 2009 she starred in the Lifetime movie, &quot;The Christmas Hope&quot;.

In 2011, Stowe announced her return and began playing Victoria Grayson, the glamorous and powerful matriarch of the Grayson family, on ABC&#x27;s television drama series &quot;Revenge&quot;. It debuted on September 21, and was picked up for a full season by ABC on October 13. Stowe&#x27;s portrayal of the character received critical praise, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for this role. In April 2012, she was listed at No. 5 in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Most Beautiful Woman list. The series ended in 2015 after four seasons and 89 episodes.

In May and June 2016, Stowe guest hosted primetime films on Turner Classic Movies, appearing in dozens of wraparounds on the channel. In 2019, she returned to acting starring as actress Margot Weston in the Netflix musical drama series, &quot;Soundtrack&quot;. The series was canceled after one season.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Stowe married Brian Benben, whom she met on the set of the NBC miniseries &quot;The Gangster Chronicles&quot; the previous year. Before living in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, they have lived on a ranch west of Austin, near Fredericksburg, Texas. She currently lives in Memphis, TN in the Midtown historic district of Chickasaw Gardens

<doc id="336796" wikidata="Q1781740" url="?curid=336796" title="Cinema of the Czech Republic">
<text>Czech cinema comprises the cinema of the Czech Republic as well as contributions to cinema by Czech people during the Austrian-Hungarian Empire period.

The earliest Czech cinema began in 1898 with Jan Kříženecký, later major contributions were made by interwar directors such as Karel Lamač and Martin Frič, with Barrandov Studios founded in 1933. During WWII, filmmakers like Otakar Vávra continued working despite Nazi occupation.

In the Post-war period, the industry was nationalized, with &quot;The Proud Princess&quot; (1952) becoming a record hit. Domestically, the most viewed Czech film ever, it was seen by 8 million people. The 1958 film &quot;The Fabulous World of Jules Verne&quot; is considered the most internationally successful Czech film ever made; soon after its release it was distributed to 72 countries and received widespread attention.

The 1960s saw the Czechoslovak New Wave emerge, featuring directors Miloš Forman and Jiří Menzel. The 1970s–80s focused on comedies and family films. In the 1990s, &quot;Marketa Lazarová&quot; was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a poll of Czech film critics and publicists.

==History==
The first Czech film director and cinematographer was Jan Kříženecký, who started filming short documentaries in Prague in the second half of 1898. The first permanent cinema house was founded by Viktor Ponrepo in 1907 in Prague.

Some early findings enabling the birth of cinematography were made by Czech scientists in the 19th century such as by Jan Evangelista Purkyně.

=== Interwar period ===
Among the prominent directors were Karel Lamač, Karl Anton, Svatopluk Innemann, Přemysl Pražský, Martin Frič and Gustav Machatý. The first Czechoslovak film fully made with synchronized sound is considered to be Když struny lkají, released in September 1930. &quot;Tonka of the Gallows&quot;, released in February 1930, was shot as a silent film and the sound was added in France. Barrandov Studios was launched by Miloš Havel in 1933, which started a Czech film industry film boom. It is the largest film studio in the country and one of the larger in Europe.

===World War II===
During World War II, many major pre-war film directors continued to make films, including Otakar Vávra, Martin Frič, Miroslav Cikán, Jan Sviták (who was murdered at the end of the war by an anti-fascist mob), Vladimír Slavínský, František Čáp, Zdeněk Gina Hašler (who emigrated to the USA after the war) and Václav Binovec.

Vladimír Čech and Václav Krška started their careers during World War II. Scenario writer Karel Steklý turned to film directing at the end of the war and maintained both careers until his death.

Well-known actor Rudolf Hrušínský (born 1920) also directed films during this period.

===After World War II===
Many prominent people of Czech cinema left the country before World War II including directors Karel Lamač and Gustav Machatý, cinematographer Otto Heller, actors Hugo Haas and Jiří Voskovec and producer Josef Auerbach. Director Vladislav Vančura was murdered by Nazis as were popular actor and signer Karel Hašler, actress Anna Letenská and writer Karel Poláček. Studio owner Miloš Havel and actresses Lída Baarová and Adina Mandlová went into exile in Germany or Austria after they were accused of collaborating with Nazis during the war. In 1943, Czech Film Archive (NFA) was established in Prague.

In 1945, the Czechoslovak film industry was nationalized. &quot;The Proud Princess&quot;, the most viewed Czech film ever, was released in 1952. It was seen by 8,222,695 people. The film also won a prize for a child film at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.

Famous movies of the 1950s include &quot;Journey to the Beginning of Time&quot;, &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;, &quot;The Emperor and the Golem&quot;, &quot;The Princess with the Golden Star&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous World of Jules Verne&quot;, &quot;Proud Princess&quot; (the most viewed Czech film ever) and &quot;Once Upon a Time, There Was a King...&quot;.

===New Wave===
Main Article: Czechoslovakian New Wave
The Czechoslovak New Wave frequently is associated with the early works of directors such as Miloš Forman, Věra Chytilová, Jiří Menzel and others, but works by older, established Czechoslovak directors such as Karel Kachyňa and Vojtěch Jasný are placed in this category. Encompassing a broad range of works in the early to mid-1960s, the Czechoslovak New Wave cannot be categorized to any one style or approach to filmmaking. Examples range from highly stylised, even avant-garde, literary adaptions using historical themes (e.g. Jan Němec&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds of the Night (Démanty noci)&quot;) to semi-improvised comedies with contemporary subjects and amateur actors (e.g., Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;The Firemen&#x27;s Ball (Hoří, má panenko)&quot;). However, a frequent feature of films from this period was absurd, black humour and an interest in the concerns of ordinary people, particularly when faced with larger historical or political changes. The acid western comedy film &quot;Lemonade Joe&quot; was a famous parody of old-time westerns. Cinematic influences included Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, but the Czechoslovak New Wave also builds organically on developments in Czechoslovak cinema in the late 1950s when the influence of Stalinism in the film industry declined.

===1970s to 1989===
Many of the directors active in the previous periods continued to work in this period, including Otakar Vávra and Jiří Menzel. During the period of normalization, only the movies that Czech authorities considered harmless were made. Therefore the most successful movies from this era are comedies, sci-fi and family movies, like in the previous periods. &quot;Three Wishes for Cinderella&quot;, a fairy-tale film from 1973, became a holiday classic in Czechoslovakia and several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden and Norway.

===1990s and beyond===
Successful Czech films made after the Velvet Revolution include &quot;Kolya&quot;, &quot;Divided We Fall&quot;, &quot;Cosy Dens&quot; and &quot;Walking Too Fast&quot;. In the 1990s, &quot;Marketa Lazarová&quot; was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists.

<doc id="336801" wikidata="Q2918369" url="?curid=336801" title="Molly house">
<text>Molly house or molly-house was a term used in 18th- and 19th-century Britain for a meeting place for homosexual men and gender-nonconforming people. The meeting places were generally taverns, public houses, coffeehouses or even private rooms where patrons could either socialise or meet possible sexual partners.

Despite the reputation of molly-houses as places having primarily sexual connotations, rather than as social meeting places, some historians are reluctant to classify them specifically as brothels. Rictor Norton, for example, argues that the regular customers could have been in fact mutual friends, at least at the beginning, since consistent evidence concerning male prostitution seems to be insufficient in Britain until the 1780s.

From 1533 onwards, homosexual relations and sexual activities remained illegal and were frequently prosecuted, with homosexual sexual activities being included in the offence categories of buggery and sodomy (the terms which were often used interchangeably), they remained capital offences until 1861. From the 16th century onwards until 1861, particularly during the 1720s, molly-houses came to be the scenes of raids and arrests, and their customers frequently became targets for blackmail.

Molly-houses can be considered a precursor to some types of contemporary meeting places for the gay community, such as cottaging.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;molly&quot; (also spelt as &quot;molley&quot;, &quot;mollie&quot;, &quot;mally&quot;) is a pet-form of the female forename Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one is close to the word moll, designating a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form &quot;mollis&quot;, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships. In a 1762 Swedish/English dictionary by Jacob Serenius and in a 1767 French/English dictionary by Thomas Nugent the word was present, but simply defined a sodomite, without effeminate connotations.

Other uses of the word can be seen in the verb &quot;to molly&quot; (to have homosexual intercourse), in the expressions &quot;mollycot&quot; (a British regional expression indicating man interested in activities traditionally associated with women) and &quot;Miss Molly&quot; (referring to an effeminate or homosexual male). The Kent tradition of Hoodening includes the participation of a Molly; a male who takes on womanhood for the night. She is referenced (often humorously) in hoodening songs.

== History ==
=== Gender issues in 18th century London ===
According to one historian, English society of Georgian era accorded high importance to the concepts of family and household as fundamental units for reproduction, subsistence and interaction between generations: in this context, male and female roles evolved into more static forms. Men were associated with an active, assertive role both in sexual behaviour and in managing the household, while women were &quot;defined in terms of their maternal functions&quot;, contrarily to a tradition common at the start of the century, attributing them features related to lustfulness and aggressiveness in sexual matters. It is possible to see that the notion of &quot;molly-house&quot; was rooted in the emergence of a distinctive identity according to gender and sexual orientation, a peculiar social phenomenon considered crucial by some critics in gender studies. As stated by Robert Shoemaker, &quot;... any activity (such as homosexual intercourse), in which [men] could be seen as acting passively was further marginalised&quot;.

Some of the activities popular among the homosexual community, that were seemingly taking place in molly-houses (by nature, marginalised meeting places), were often associated both to female roles and to a family environment (e.g. cross-dressing, &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;mock birth&quot; rituals, as described in a satire work of the time, Edward Ward&#x27;s &quot;Satyrical Reflections on Clubs&quot;, Chapter XXV &quot;Of the Mollies Club&quot;).

=== Molly-houses and the homosexual subculture in London ===

As sodomy was a capital offence, the organisation of homosexual men and their activities had to be a crucial point, in order to keep the community as safe as possible from prosecution. As a consequence, molly districts seemed to appear, and eventually grow, in areas in which their business could be acknowledged and tolerated at the same time: such connivance could be often found in areas with a high rate of criminal acts such as theft and prostitution.

An editorial in &quot;The London Journal&quot; singled out a number of areas:
* The arcades of Covent Garden and the Royal Exchange;
* Moorfields (the path crossing the middle of these fields was known as the Sodomites&#x27; Walk);
* Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and its bog-house, as recorded in trials.
* The south side of St James&#x27;s Park, a popular cruising ground frequented by soldiers from the nearby barracks and homosexual habitués.
The presence of pillories punishing sodomitical offences, ironically, identified the sites where such acts frequently took place. Pillories were often organised near the crime locations attributed to the accused.

Molly-houses could be considered the most organised phenomenon of London 18th-century homosexual subculture. They were enclosed, private spaces gathering individuals with a common purpose, i.e. socializing and seeking pleasure with partners of the same sex.

=== Law enforcement and sources of information ===
Before 1533, the &quot;unnatural sin&quot; (also defined &quot;detestable crime&quot; in trial records) of sodomy or &quot;buggery&quot;, (a specific common law offence, meaning anal intercourse between a man and another man or woman, or anal or vaginal intercourse with a beast – in this way encompassing both sodomy and bestiality) was dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts. From that year however, the country&#x27;s first civil sodomy law was introduced as &quot;An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie&quot; (Buggery Act 1533), and also criminal courts could prosecute individuals accused of such crimes. According to the Old Bailey Online Proceedings site:In order to obtain a conviction, it was necessary to prove that both penetration and ejaculation had occurred, and two witnesses were required to prove the crime. Both the &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; partner could be found guilty of this offence. But due to the difficulty of proving this actual penetration and ejaculation many men were prosecuted with the reduced charge of assault with sodomitical intent.From the late 1690s to the early 1710s, the Societies for the Reformation of Manners (organizations born after the Revolution in 1688, seeking to eliminate immorality and disrespect for religion from public life) actively pursued prostitutes, Sabbath breakers and also homosexual men, through the means of spies and &quot;provocateurs&quot; to dismantle molly houses and prosecute individuals. In the 1720s and 30s thief-takers like Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild stimulated the Societies&#x27; activities. The peak of this wave of prosecution is to be recognized in the late 1720s with a raid on the most famous molly house, Mother Clap&#x27;s. According to Rictor Norton:

Molly-houses at that time were evidently and intrinsically related to since they gathered those who were called sodomites being a capital offence, so most of the information concerning molly-houses and the community around them is available through an indirect form, that is, mostly through newspaper reports and the accounts given during the Old Bailey trials relating to sexual offences, such as &quot;sodomy, assault with sodomitical intent&quot; and &quot;keeping a brothel&quot;, or sometimes the ones related to theft cases (for example, in cases with men caught stealing during a sexual encounter).

Other important sources include satires and pamphlets, such as &quot;An Answer To A Late Insolent Libel&quot; by Jonathan Wild, Edward Ward&#x27;s &quot;Satyrical Reflections on Clubs&quot;, Chapter XXV &quot;Of the Mollies Club&quot;, John Dunton&#x27;s &quot;The He-Strumpets. A Satyr on the Sodomite-Club&quot;, James Dalton&#x27;s &quot;A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last&quot;.

Later in the eighteenth century, waves of prosecutions can be identified in the 1750s and 1770s. However most of the details concerning sexual offences trials came to be more and more rare owing to a trend for a strait-laced morality, but fraud and extortion cases seemed to continue in giving &quot;retail at length detailed accounts of alleged sexual encounters between men&quot;.

=== Activities ===
The adoption of specific codes and rituals in relating to each other seemed to be another feature allowing cohesion in the group. These peculiarities were often described in trials and libels, often to be put on public display and disapproval. Some of the uses seemed to be:
* the use of Female Dialect, and the assumption of female names, the Maiden Name tradition: the controversial figure of Charles Hitchen (alternative spelling: &quot;Hitchin&quot;) member of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, notable thief-taker, former Under City Marshal in London, was described as a regular in molly-houses according to a libel written by Jonathan Wild and also to be referred by using female names.
the &quot;Marshal&quot; was complimented by the Company with the Titles of &quot;Madam&quot; and &quot;Ladyship&quot;.From James Dalton&#x27;s &quot;A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last&quot;:They could take on a female persona, have a female name, and affect feminine mannerisms and speech. Again from Jonathan Wild:The men calling one another &quot;my Dear&quot;, and hugging, kissing, and tickling each other, as if they were a Mixture of wanton Males and Females, and assuming effeminate Voices and Airs
* Cross-dressing, from Jonathan Wild:At the expected Time several of the sporting Youngsters were seized in Women&#x27;s Apparel, and convey&#x27;d to the &quot;Compter&quot;. Next Morning they were carried before the Lord-Mayor in the same Dress they were taken in. Some were compleatly rigg&#x27;d in Gowns, Petticoats, Head-cloths, fine lac&#x27;d Shoes, furbelow&#x27;d Scarves and Marks; some had Riding-hoods; some were dressed like Milk-Maids, others like Shepheardesses with green Hats, Waistcoats and Petticoats; and others had their Faces patch&#x27;d and painted, and wore very extensive Hoop-petticoats, which had been very lately introduced.
* Marriage ceremonies: often a euphemism for sexual intercourse but sometimes actual ceremonies between a Mollie and his male lover, enacted to symbolise their partnership and commitment to each other.
* &quot;Mock-birth&quot; rituals: during which a man dressed in a nightgown pretended to be a woman giving birth to a baby assisted by fellow Mollies as &quot;midwives&quot; — a fact confirmed by other sources including trials. This ritual almost certainly originated as a couvade, designated to collectively relieve the extreme stress this particular social group was forced to live under. The ceremonies described by Ned Ward took place in specific periods called &quot;Festival Nights&quot;, which other sources indicate took place towards the end of December.

=== Mother Clap&#x27;s molly-house ===

The most well known molly-house in 18th century London was that owned by Mother Clap, which had been open from 1724 to 1726, when a raid sustained by the Societies for the Reformation of Manners had it dismantled. It was located in Field Lane, near to another tavern &quot;The Bunch of Grapes&quot; in Holborn, a suburban parish of Middlesex a short distance from the City of London. This area came to be renowned as a rookery in the next decades, and described as &quot;a sort of distinct town, or district calculated for the reception of the darkest and most dangerous enemies to society; in which when pursued for the commission of crimes they easily conceal themselves and readily escape&quot;. A literary example can be interpreted as a sort of confirmation of the reputation of this lane, since Charles Dickens placed here Fagin&#x27;s den, an old Jewish man earning a living as a fence, in his 1837 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. This peculiar homosexual meeting place, however, became well known to the public during the 1720s through the trial of its keeper, Margaret Clap, indicted for keeping a disorderly house and for encouraging her customers to commit sodomy; and, particularly, through the account given by an agent provocateur, Samuel Stevens.

On Sunday Night the 14th of November. I went to the Prisoners House in Field-Lane, Holbourn. I found near Men Fifty there, making Love to one another as they call&#x27;d it. Sometimes they&#x27;d sit in one anothers Laps, use their Hands indecently Dance and make Curtsies and mimick the Language of Women – O Sir! - Pray Sir! - Dear Sir! Lord how can ye serve me so! - Ah ye little dear Toad! Then they&#x27;d go by Couples, into a Room on the same Floor to be marry&#x27;d as they call&#x27;d it. The Door at that Room was kept by – Ecclestone to prevent any body from balking their Diversions.

She and half a dozen of her customers were also put into the pillory, fined, and imprisoned for periods of up to two years. Three of her customers were hanged for sodomy: Gabriel Lawrence, a 43-year-old milkman; William Griffin, a 43-year-old furniture upholsterer; and Thomas Wright, who was a molly house keeper.

=== Trials and personalities related to molly-houses ===
In the eighteenth century according to the Old Bailey Proceedings, only two individuals were formally arrested for keeping a molly-house: Margaret Clap and Julius Cesar Taylor, but several accused of sodomitical practices seems to be reported as brothel keepers as well (i.e. Thomas Wright).

On 9 May 1726, three men (Gabriel Lawrence, William Griffin, and Thomas Wright) were hanged at Tyburn for buggery following a raid of Margaret Clap&#x27;s molly-house. Their trials are fundamental since they provide important details for the descriptions of the gay community surroundings. On 12 April 1727 Charles Hitchin was convicted of assault with sodomitical intent.

<text>George Murphy &quot;Pops&quot; Foster (May 19, 1892 – October 30, 1969) was an American jazz musician, best known for his vigorous slap bass playing of the string bass. He also played the tuba and trumpet professionally.

==Biography==
Foster was born to Charley and Annie Foster, who &quot;was nearly fullblooded Cherokee,&quot; on a plantation near McCall in Ascension Parish near Donaldsonville in south Louisiana, United States. His family moved to New Orleans when he was about 10 years of age. His older brother, Willard Foster, began playing banjo and guitar; George started out on a cello then switched to string bass. Foster married twice: to Bertha Foster in 1912 and Alma Foster in 1936.

Pops Foster was playing professionally by 1907 and worked with Jack Carey, Kid Ory, Armand Piron, King Oliver and other prominent hot bands of the era. In 1921, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to play with the Charlie Creath and Dewey Jackson bands, in which he would be active for much of the decade. He also joined Ory in Los Angeles. He acquired the nickname &quot;Pops&quot; because he was far older than any of the other players in the band.

In 1929, Foster moved to New York City, where he played with the bands of Luis Russell and Louis Armstrong through 1940. He gigged with New York-based bands through the 1940s, including those of Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, and regularly participated in the national &quot;This Is Jazz&quot; radio program. He recorded with the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet (Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, Fitz Weston, and Kaiser Marshall) and Septet (on two consecutive dates in 1945, with Hot Lips Page (as Pappa Snow White), Sammy Price (as Jimmy Blythe Jr.), Danny Barker and Sid Catlett, and on the second session with Pleasant Joe on vocals).

In the late 1940s, he began touring more widely and played in many countries in Europe, especially in France, and throughout the United States including returns to New Orleans and California.

&quot;The Autobiography of Pops Foster&quot; was published in 1971, with a new edition in 2005. Foster is quoted, &quot;Some of the books are fouled up on the times in New Orleans&quot;, &quot;and some of the guys weren&#x27;t telling the truth.&quot; &quot;The critics and guys who write about jazz think they know more about what went on in New Orleans than the guys that were there.&quot;

<text>Orthodontics is a dentistry specialty that addresses the diagnosis, prevention, management, and correction of mal-positioned teeth and jaws, as well as misaligned bite patterns. It may also address the modification of facial growth, known as dentofacial orthopedics.

Abnormal alignment of the teeth and jaws is very common. The approximate worldwide prevalence of malocclusion was as high as 56%. However, conclusive scientific evidence for the health benefits of orthodontic treatment is lacking, although patients with completed treatment have reported a higher quality of life than that of untreated patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The main reason for the prevalence of these malocclusions is diets with less fresh fruit and vegetables and overall softer foods in childhood, causing smaller jaws with less room for the teeth to erupt. Treatment may require several months to a few years and entails using dental braces and other appliances to gradually adjust tooth position and jaw alignment. In cases where the malocclusion is severe, jaw surgery may be incorporated into the treatment plan. Treatment usually begins before a person reaches adulthood, insofar as pre-adult bones may be adjusted more easily before adulthood.

== History ==
Though it was rare until the Industrial Revolution, there is evidence of the issue of overcrowded, irregular, and protruding teeth afflicting individuals. Evidence from Greek and Etruscan materials suggests that attempts to treat this disorder date back to 1000 BC, showcasing primitive yet impressively well-crafted orthodontic appliances. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a range of devices for the &quot;regulation&quot; of teeth were described by various dentistry authors who occasionally put them into practice. As a modern science, orthodontics dates back to the mid-1800s. The field&#x27;s influential contributors include Norman William Kingsley (1829–1913) and Edward Angle (1855–1930). Angle created the first basic system for classifying malocclusions, a system that remains in use today.

Beginning in the mid-1800s, Norman Kingsley published &quot;Oral Deformities&quot;, which is now credited as one of the first works to begin systematically documenting orthodontics. Being a major presence in American dentistry during the latter half of the 19th century, not only was Kingsley one of the early users of extraoral force to correct protruding teeth, but he was also one of the pioneers for treating cleft palates and associated issues.
During the era of orthodontics under Kingsley and his colleagues, the treatment was focused on straightening teeth and creating facial harmony. Ignoring occlusal relationships, it was typical to remove teeth for a variety of dental issues, such as malalignment or overcrowding. The concept of an intact dentition was not widely appreciated in those days, making bite correlations seem irrelevant.

In the late 1800s, the concept of occlusion was essential for creating reliable prosthetic replacement teeth. This idea was further refined and ultimately applied in various ways when dealing with healthy dental structures as well. As these concepts of prosthetic occlusion progressed, it became an invaluable tool for dentistry.

It was in 1890 that the work and impact of Dr. Edwards H. Angle began to be felt, with his contribution to modern orthodontics particularly noteworthy. Initially focused on prosthodontics, he taught in Pennsylvania and Minnesota before directing his attention towards dental occlusion and the treatments needed to maintain it as a normal condition, thus becoming known as the &quot;father of modern orthodontics&quot;.

By the beginning of the 20th century, orthodontics had become more than just the straightening of crooked teeth. The concept of ideal occlusion, as postulated by Angle and incorporated into a classification system, enabled a shift towards treating malocclusion, which is any deviation from normal occlusion. Having a full set of teeth on both arches was highly sought after in orthodontic treatment due to the need for exact relationships between them. Extraction as an orthodontic procedure was heavily opposed by Angle and those who followed him. As occlusion became the key priority, facial proportions and aesthetics were neglected. To achieve ideal occlusals without using external forces, Angle postulated that having perfect occlusion was the best way to gain optimum facial aesthetics.

With the passing of time, it became quite evident that even an exceptional occlusion was not suitable when considered from an aesthetic point of view. Not only were there issues related to aesthetics, but it usually proved impossible to keep a precise occlusal relationship achieved by forcing teeth together over extended durations with the use of robust elastics, something Angle and his students had previously suggested. Charles Tweed in America and Raymond Begg in Australia (who both studied under Angle) re-introduced dentistry extraction into orthodontics during the 1940s and 1950s so they could improve facial esthetics while also ensuring better stability concerning occlusal relationships.

In the postwar period, cephalometric radiography started to be used by orthodontists for measuring changes in tooth and jaw position caused by growth and treatment. The x-rays showed that many Class II and III malocclusions were due to improper jaw relations as opposed to misaligned teeth. It became evident that orthodontic therapy could adjust mandibular development, leading to the formation of functional jaw orthopedics in Europe and extraoral force measures in the US. These days, both functional appliances and extraoral devices are applied around the globe with the aim of amending growth patterns and forms. Consequently, pursuing true, or at least improved, jaw relationships had become the main objective of treatment by the mid-20th century.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, orthodontics was in need of an upgrade. The American Journal of Orthodontics was created for this purpose in 1915; before it, there were no scientific objectives to follow, nor any precise classification system and brackets that lacked features.

Until the mid-1970s, braces were made by wrapping metal around each tooth. With advancements in adhesives, it became possible to instead bond metal brackets to the teeth.

In 1972, Lawrence F. Andrews gave an insightful definition of the ideal occlusion in permanent teeth. This has had meaningful effects on orthodontic treatments that are administered regularly, and these are: 1. Correct interarchal relationships 2. Correct crown angulation (tip) 3. Correct crown inclination (torque) 4. No rotations 5. Tight contact points 6. Flat Curve of Spee (0.0–2.5 mm), and based on these principles, he discovered a treatment system called the straight-wire appliance system, or the pre-adjusted edgewise system. Introduced in 1976, Larry Andrews&#x27; pre-adjusted edgewise appliance, more commonly known as the straight wire appliance, has since revolutionized fixed orthodontic treatment. The advantage of the design lies in its bracket and archwire combination, which requires only minimal wire bending from the orthodontist or clinician. It&#x27;s aptly named after this feature: the angle of the slot and thickness of the bracket base ultimately determine where each tooth is situated with little need for extra manipulation.

Prior to the invention of a straight wire appliance, orthodontists were utilizing a non-programmed standard edgewise fixed appliance system, or Begg&#x27;s pin and tube system. Both of these systems employed identical brackets for each tooth and necessitated the bending of an archwire in three planes for locating teeth in their desired positions, with these bends dictating ultimate placements.

==Evolution of the current orthodontic appliances==
When it comes to orthodontic appliances, they are divided into two types: removable and fixed. Removable appliances can be taken on and off by the patient as required. On the other hand, fixed appliances cannot be taken off as they remain bonded to the teeth during treatment.

===Fixed appliances===

Fixed orthodontic appliances are predominantly derived from the edgewise appliance approach, which typically begins with round wires before transitioning to rectangular archwires for improving tooth alignment. These rectangluar wires promote precision in the positioning of teeth following initial treatment. In contrast to the Begg appliance, which was based solely on round wires and auxiliary springs, the Tip-Edge system emerged in the early 21st century. This innovative technology allowed for the utilization of rectangular archwires to precisely control tooth movement during the finishing stages after initial treatment with round wires. Thus, almost all modern fixed appliances can be considered variations on this edgewise appliance system.

Early 20th-century orthodontist Edward Angle made a major contribution to the world of dentistry. He created four distinct appliance systems that have been used as the basis for many orthodontic treatments today, barring a few exceptions. They are E-arch, pin and tube, ribbon arch, and edgewise systems.

====E-arch====
Edward H. Angle made a significant contribution to the dental field when he released the 7th edition of his book in 1907, which outlined his theories and detailed his technique. This approach was founded upon the iconic &quot;E-Arch&quot; or &#x27;the-arch&#x27; shape as well as inter-maxillary elastics. This device was different from any other appliance of its period as it featured a rigid framework to which teeth could be tied effectively in order to recreate an arch form that followed pre-defined dimensions. Molars were fitted with braces, and a powerful labial archwire was positioned around the arch. The wire ended in a thread, and to move it forward, an adjustable nut was used, which allowed for an increase in circumference. By ligation, each individual tooth was attached to this expansive archwire.

====Pin and tube appliance====
Due to its limited range of motion, Angle was unable to achieve precise tooth positioning with an E-arch. In order to bypass this issue, he started using bands on other teeth combined with a vertical tube for each individual tooth. These tubes held a soldered pin, which could be repositioned at each appointment in order to move them in place. Dubbed the &quot;bone-growing appliance&quot;, this contraption was theorized to encourage healthier bone growth due to its potential for transferring force directly to the roots. However, implementing it proved troublesome in reality.

====Ribbon arch====
Realizing that the pin and tube appliance was not easy to control, Angle developed a better option, the ribbon arch, which was much simpler to use. Most of its components were already prepared by the manufacturer, so it was significantly easier to manage than before. In order to attach the ribbon arch, the occlusal area of the bracket was opened. Brackets were only added to eight incisors and mandibular canines, as it would be impossible to insert the arch into both horizontal molar tubes and the vertical brackets of adjacent premolars. This lack of understanding posed a considerable challenge to dental professionals; they were unable to make corrections to an excessive Spee curve in bicuspid teeth. Despite the complexity of the situation, it was necessary for practitioners to find a resolution. Unparalleled to its counterparts, what made the ribbon arch instantly popular was that its archwire had remarkable spring qualities and could be utilized to accurately align teeth that were misaligned. However, a major drawback of this device was its inability to effectively control root position since it did not have enough resilience to generate the torque movements required for setting roots in their new place.

====Edgewise appliance====
In an effort to rectify the issues with the ribbon arch, Angle shifted the orientation of its slot from vertical, instead making it horizontal. In addition, he swapped out the wire and replaced it with a precious metal wire that was rotated by 90 degrees in relation—henceforth known as Edgewise. Following extensive trials, it was concluded that dimensions of 22 × 28 mils were optimal for obtaining excellent control over crown and root positioning across all three planes of space. After debuting in 1928, this appliance quickly became one of the mainstays for multibanded fixed therapy, although ribbon arches continued to be utilized for another decade or so beyond this point too.

====Labiolingual====
Prior to Angle, the idea of fitting attachments on individual teeth had not been thought of, and in his lifetime, his concern for precisely positioning each tooth was not highly appraised. In addition to using fingersprings for repositioning teeth with a range of removable devices, two main appliance systems were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. Labiolingual appliances use bands on the first molars joined with heavy lingual and labial archwires affixed with soldered fingersprings to shift single teeth.

====Twin wire ====
Utilizing bands around both incisors and molars, a twin-wire appliance was designed to provide alignment between these teeth. Constructed with two 10-mil steel archwires, its delicate features were safeguarded by lengthy tubes stretching from molars towards canines. Despite its efforts, it had limited capacity for movement without further modifications, rendering it obsolete in modern orthodontic practice.

===Begg&#x27;s Appliance===
Returning to Australia in the 1920s, the renowned orthodontist, Raymond Begg, applied his knowledge of ribbon arch appliances, which he had learned from the Angle School. On top of this, Begg recognized that extracting teeth was sometimes vital for successful outcomes and sought to modify the ribbon arch appliance to provide more control when dealing with root positioning.
In the late 1930s, Begg developed his adaptation of the appliance, which took three forms. Firstly, a high-strength 16-mil round stainless steel wire replaced the original precious metal ribbon arch. Secondly, he kept the same ribbon arch bracket but inverted it so that it pointed toward the gums instead of away from them. Lastly, auxiliary springs were added to control root movement. This resulted in what would come to be known as the Begg Appliance. With this design, friction was decreased since contact between wire and bracket was minimal, and binding was minimized due to tipping and uprighting being used for anchorage control, which lessened contact angles between wires and corners of the bracket.

===Tip-Edge System===
Begg&#x27;s influence is still seen in modern appliances, such as Tip-Edge brackets. This type of bracket incorporates a rectangular slot cutaway on one side to allow for crown tipping with no incisal deflection of an archwire, allowing teeth to be tipped during space closure and then uprighted through auxiliary springs or even a rectangular wire for torque purposes in finishing. At the initial stages of treatment, small-diameter steel archwires should be used when working with Tip-Edge brackets.

==Contemporary edgewise systems==
Throughout time, there has been a shift in which appliances are favored by dentists. In particular, during the 1960s, when it was introduced, the Begg appliance gained wide popularity due to its efficiency compared to edgewise appliances of that era; it could produce the same results with less investment on the dentist&#x27;s part. Nevertheless, since then, there have been advances in technology and sophistication in edgewise appliances, which led to the opposite conclusion: nowadays, edgewise appliances are more efficient than the Begg appliance, thus explaining why it is commonly used.

===Automatic rotational control===
At the beginning, Angle attached eyelets to the edges of archwires so that they could be held with ligatures and help manage rotations. Now, however, no extra ligature is needed due to either twin brackets or single brackets that have added wings touching underneath the wire (Lewis or Lang brackets). Both types of brackets simplify the process of obtaining moments that control movements along a particular plane of space.

===Alteration in bracket slot dimensions===
In modern dentistry, two types of edgewise appliances exist: the 18- and 22-slot varieties. While these appliances are used differently, the introduction of a 20-slot device with more precise features has been considered but not pursued yet.

===Straight-wire bracket prescriptions===
Rather than rely on the same bracket for all teeth, L.F. Andrews found a way to make different brackets for each tooth in the 1980s, thanks to the increased convenience of bonding. This adjustment enabled him to avoid having multiple bends in archwires that would have been needed to make up for variations in tooth anatomy. Ultimately, this led to what was termed a &quot;straight-wire appliance&quot; system – an edgewise appliance that greatly enhanced its efficiency. The modern edgewise appliance has slightly different construction than the original one. Instead of relying on faciolingual bends to accommodate variations among teeth, each bracket has a correspondingly varying base thickness depending on the tooth it is intended for. However, due to individual differences between teeth, this does not completely eliminate the need for compensating bends. Accurately placing the roots of many teeth requires angling brackets in relation to the long axis of the tooth. Traditionally, this mesiodistal root positioning necessitated using second-order, or tip, bends along the archwire. However, angling the bracket or bracket slot eliminates this need for bends.

Given the discrepancies in inclination of facial surfaces across individual teeth, placing a twist, otherwise known as third-order or torque bends, into segments of each rectangular archwire was initially required with the edgewise appliance. These bends were necessary for all patients and wires, not just to avoid any unintentional movement of suitably placed teeth or when moving roots facially or lingually. Angulation of either brackets or slots can minimize the need for second-order or tip bends on archwires. Contemporary edgewise appliances come with brackets designed to adjust for any facial inclinations, thereby eliminating or reducing any third-order bends. These brackets already have angulation and torque values built in so that each rectangluar archwire can be contorted to form a custom fit without inadvertently shifting any correctly positioned teeth. Without bracket angulation and torque, second-order or tip bends would still be required on each patient&#x27;s archwire.

== Methods ==

A typical treatment for incorrectly positioned teeth (malocclusion) takes from one to two years, with braces being adjusted every four to 10 weeks by orthodontists, while university-trained dental specialists are versed in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of dental and facial irregularities. Orthodontists offer a wide range of treatment options to straighten crooked teeth, fix irregular bites, and align the jaws correctly. There are many ways to adjust malocclusion. In growing patients, there are more options to treat skeletal discrepancies, either by promoting or restricting growth using functional appliances, orthodontic headgear, or a reverse pull facemask. Most orthodontic work begins in the early permanent dentition stage before skeletal growth is completed. If skeletal growth has completed, jaw surgery is an option. Sometimes teeth are extracted to aid the orthodontic treatment (teeth are extracted in about half of all the cases, most commonly the premolars).

Orthodontic therapy may include the use of fixed or removable appliances. Most orthodontic therapy is delivered using appliances that are fixed in place, for example, braces that are adhesively bonded to the teeth. Fixed appliances may provide greater mechanical control of the teeth; optimal treatment outcomes are improved by using fixed appliances.

Fixed appliances may be used, for example, to rotate teeth if they do not fit the arch shape of the other teeth in the mouth, to adjust multiple teeth to different places, to change the tooth angle of teeth, or to change the position of a tooth&#x27;s root. This treatment course is not preferred where a patient has poor oral hygiene, as decalcification, tooth decay, or other complications may result. If a patient is unmotivated (insofar as treatment takes several months and requires commitment to oral hygiene), or if malocclusions are mild.

The biology of tooth movement and how advances in gene therapy and molecular biology technology may shape the future of orthodontic treatment.

=== Braces ===

Braces are usually placed on the front side of the teeth, but they may also be placed on the side facing the tongue (called lingual braces). Brackets made out of stainless steel or porcelain are bonded to the center of the teeth using an adhesive. Wires are placed in a slot in the brackets, which allows for controlled movement in all three dimensions.

Apart from wires, forces can be applied using elastic bands, and springs may be used to push teeth apart or to close a gap. Several teeth may be tied together with ligatures, and different kinds of hooks can be placed to allow for connecting an elastic band.

Clear aligners are an alternative to braces, but insufficient evidence exists to determine their effectiveness.

==== Treatment duration ====

The time required for braces varies from person to person as it depends on the severity of the problem, the amount of room available, the distance the teeth must travel, the health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone, and how closely the patient follows instructions. On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years. After braces are removed, most patients will need to wear a retainer all the time for the first six months, then only during sleep for many years.

=== Headgear ===

Orthodontic headgear, sometimes referred to as an &quot;extra-oral appliance&quot;, is a treatment approach that requires the patient to have a device strapped onto their head to help correct malocclusion—typically used when the teeth do not align properly. Headgear is most often used along with braces or other orthodontic appliances. While braces correct the position of teeth, orthodontic headgear—which, as the name suggests, is worn on or strapped onto the patient&#x27;s head—is most often added to orthodontic treatment to help alter the alignment of the jaw, although there are some situations in which such an appliance can help move teeth, particularly molars.

Whatever the purpose, orthodontic headgear works by exerting tension on the braces via hooks, a facebow, coils, elastic bands, metal orthodontic bands, and other attachable appliances directly into the patient&#x27;s mouth. It is most effective for children and teenagers because their jaws are still developing and can be easily manipulated. (If an adult is fitted with headgear, it is usually to help correct the position of teeth that have shifted after other teeth have been extracted.) Thus, headgear is typically used to treat a number of jaw alignment or bite problems, such as overbite and underbite.

=== Palatal expansion ===
Palatal expansion can be best achieved using a fixed tissue-borne appliance. Removable appliances can push teeth outward but are less effective at maxillary sutural expansion. The effects of a removable expander may look the same as they push teeth outward, but they should not be confused with actually expanding the palate. Proper palate expansion can create more space for teeth as well as improve both oral and nasal airflow.

=== Jaw surgery ===
Jaw surgery may be required to fix severe malocclusions. The bone is broken during surgery and stabilized with titanium (or bioresorbable) plates and screws to allow for healing to take place. After surgery, regular orthodontic treatment is used to move the teeth into their final position.

=== During treatment ===
To reduce pain during the orthodontic treatment, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), vibratory devices, chewing adjuncts, brainwave music, or cognitive behavioral therapy can be used. However, the supporting evidence is of low quality, and the results are inconclusive.

===Post treatment===
After orthodontic treatment has been completed, there is a tendency for teeth to return, or relapse, back to their pre-treatment positions. Over 50% of patients have some reversion to pre-treatment positions within 10 years following treatment. To prevent relapse, the majority of patients will be offered a retainer once treatment has been completed and will benefit from wearing their retainers. Retainers can be either fixed or removable.

==== Removable retainers ====
Removable retainers are made from clear plastic, and they are custom-fitted for the patient&#x27;s mouth. It has a tight fit and holds all of the teeth in position. There are many types of brands for clear retainers, including Zendura Retainer, Essix Retainer, and Vivera Retainer. A Hawley retainer is also a removable orthodontic appliance made from a combination of plastic and metal that is custom-molded to fit the patient&#x27;s mouth. Removable retainers will be worn for different periods of time, depending on the patient&#x27;s need to stabilize the dentition.

==== Fixed retainers ====
Fixed retainers are a simple wire fixed to the tongue-facing part of the incisors using dental adhesive and can be specifically useful to prevent rotation in incisors. Other types of fixed retainers can include labial or lingual braces, with brackets fixed to the teeth.

=== Clear aligners ===
Clear aligners are another form of orthodontics commonly used today, involving removable plastic trays. There has been controversy about the effectiveness of aligners such as Invisalign or Byte; some consider them to be faster and more freeing than the alternatives.

==Training==
There are several specialty areas in dentistry, but the specialty of orthodontics was the first to be recognized within dentistry. Specifically, the American Dental Association recognized orthodontics as a specialty in the 1950s. Each country has its own system for training and registering orthodontic specialists.

===Australia===
In Australia, to obtain an accredited three-year full-time university degree in orthodontics, one will need to be a qualified dentist (complete an AHPRA-registered general dental degree) with a minimum of two years of clinical experience. There are several universities in Australia that offer orthodontic programs: the University of Adelaide, the University of Melbourne, the University of Sydney, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia, and the University of Otago. Orthodontic courses are accredited by the Australian Dental Council and reviewed by the Australian Society of Orthodontists (ASO). Prospective applicants should obtain information from the relevant institution before applying for admission. After completing a degree in orthodontics, specialists are required to be registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) in order to practice.

===Bangladesh===
Dhaka Dental College in Bangladesh is one of the many schools recognized by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM&amp;DC) that offer post-graduation orthodontic courses. Before applying to any post-graduation training courses, an applicant must have completed the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) examination from any dental college. After application, the applicant must take an admissions test held by the specific college. If successful, selected candidates undergo training for six months.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, obtaining a dental degree, such as a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Medical Dentistry (DMD), would be required before being accepted by a school for orthodontic training. Currently, there are 10 schools in the country offering the orthodontic specialty. Candidates should contact the individual school directly to obtain the most recent pre-requisites before entry. The Canadian Dental Association expects orthodontists to complete at least two years of post-doctoral, specialty training in orthodontics in an accredited program after graduating from their dental degree.

===United States===
Similar to Canada, there are several colleges and universities in the United States that offer orthodontic programs. Every school has a different enrollment process, but every applicant is required to have graduated with a DDS or DMD from an accredited dental school. Entrance into an accredited orthodontics program is extremely competitive and begins by passing a national or state licensing exam.

The program generally lasts for two to three years, and by the final year, graduates are required to complete the written American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) exam. This exam is also broken down into two components: a written exam and a clinical exam. The written exam is a comprehensive exam that tests for the applicant&#x27;s knowledge of basic sciences and clinical concepts. The clinical exam, however, consists of a Board Case Oral Examination (BCOE), a Case Report Examination (CRE), and a Case Report Oral Examination (CROE). Once certified, certification must then be renewed every ten years. Orthodontic programs can award a Master of Science degree, a Doctor of Science degree, or a Doctor of Philosophy degree, depending on the school and individual research requirements.

===United Kingdom===

Throughout the United Kingdom, there are several Orthodontic Specialty Training Registrar posts available. The program is full-time for three years, and upon completion, trainees graduate with a degree at the Masters or Doctorate level. Training may take place within hospital departments that are linked to recognized dental schools. Obtaining a Certificate of Completion of Specialty Training (CCST) allows an orthodontic specialist to be registered under the General Dental Council (GDC). An orthodontic specialist can provide care within a primary care setting, but to work at a hospital as an orthodontic consultant, higher-level training is further required as a post-CCST trainee. To work within a university setting as an academic consultant, completing research toward obtaining a Ph.D. is also required.

<text>Joachim Murat ( , also ; ; ; 25 March 1767 – 13 October 1815) was a French Army officer and statesman who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Under the French Empire he received the military titles of Marshal of the Empire and Admiral of France. He was the first Prince Murat, Grand Duke of Berg from 1806 to 1808, and King of Naples as Joachim-Napoleon () from 1808 to 1815.

Born in Labastide-Fortunière in southwestern France, Murat briefly pursued a vocation in the clergy before enlisting in a cavalry regiment on the outbreak of the French Revolution. Murat distinguished himself under the command of General Napoleon Bonaparte on 13 Vendémiaire (1795), when he seized a group of large cannons and was instrumental in suppressing the royalist insurrection in Paris. He became Napoleon&#x27;s aide-de-camp and commanded the cavalry during the French campaigns in Italy and Egypt. Murat played a pivotal role in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (1799), which brought Napoleon to political power. In 1800 he married Caroline Bonaparte, thus becoming a brother-in-law to Napoleon.

Murat was named a Marshal of the Empire on the proclamation of the French Empire. He took part in various battles including those of Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena and Eylau, where he led a famous massed cavalry charge against the Russians. In 1806, Murat was appointed Grand Duke of Berg, a title he held until 1808 when he was named King of Naples. He continued to serve Napoleon during his Russian and German campaigns but abandoned the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; after the Battle of Leipzig to save his throne. In 1815, Murat launched the Neapolitan War against the Austrian Empire but was decisively defeated at Tolentino. He fled to Corsica and then made a last-ditch attempt to recover his throne, but was soon taken prisoner by King Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was tried for treason and sentenced to death by firing squad in Pizzo.

==Early life==
Murat was born on 25 March 1767 in La Bastide-Fortunière (later renamed Labastide-Murat after him), in Guyenne (the present-day French department of Lot). His father was Pierre Murat-Jordy, an affluent yeoman, innkeeper, postmaster and churchwarden. His mother was Jeanne Loubières, the daughter of Pierre Loubières and his wife Jeanne Viellescazes.

Murat&#x27;s parents intended that he pursue a vocation in the church. He was taught by the parish priest, after which he won a place at the College of Saint-Michel at Cahors when he was ten years old. He then entered the seminary of the Lazarists at Toulouse. When a regiment of cavalry passed through the city in 1787, he ran away and enlisted on 23 February 1787 in the &quot;Chasseurs des Ardennes&quot;, which the following year became known as the &quot;Chasseurs de Champagne&quot;, or the 12th Chasseurs. In 1789, an affair forced him to resign, and he returned to his family, becoming a clerk to a haberdasher at Saint-Céré.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
By 1790, Murat had joined the National Guard. The Canton of Montaucon sent him as its representative to the Fête de la Fédération, the celebration of the first anniversary of Bastille Day (&quot;la Fête nationale&quot;). He was reinstated in his former regiment. Because part of the 12th Chasseurs had been sent to Montmédy to protect the royal family on its flight to Varennes, the regiment had to defend its honour and loyalty to the Republic. Murat and the regiment&#x27;s adjutant made a speech to the assembly at Toul to that effect. 

In 1792, Murat joined the Constitutional Guard, but left it that same year. His departure was attributed to various causes, including his constant quarreling and dueling, although he claimed he left to avoid punishment for being absent without leave.

An ardent Republican, Murat wrote to his brother in 1791 stating he was preoccupied with revolutionary affairs and would sooner die than cease to be a patriot. Upon his departure from the Constitutional Guard, he reported to the Committee of Surveillance of the Constitutional Assembly that the Guard was guilty of treason and that his lieutenant colonel, a man named Descours, had encouraged him to serve in the émigré army of Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, then stationed in Koblenz. This garnered for him the support of the Republicans. Murat rejoined his former regiment and was promoted to corporal in April, and in May to sergeant. 

By 19 November 1792, Murat was 25 years old and elated at his latest promotion. As a &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot;, he thought, his family must recognise that he had no great propensity for the priesthood, and he was hoping to prove that he had not been wrong in wishing to be a soldier. Two of the ministers had accused him of being an aristocrat, confusing him with the noble family of Murat d&#x27;Auvergne, an accusation that continued to haunt him for the next several years.

===13 Vendémiaire===

In the autumn of 1795, two years after King Louis XVI had been guillotined, royalists and counter-revolutionaries organised an armed uprising. On 3 October, General Napoleon Bonaparte, who was stationed in Paris, was named commander of the French National Convention&#x27;s defending forces. Bonaparte tasked Murat, who had offered himself voluntarily, with the gathering of artillery from a suburb outside the control of the government&#x27;s forces.

Murat managed to take the cannons of the &quot;Camp des Sablons&quot; and transport them to the centre of Paris while avoiding the rioters. The use of these cannons – the famous &quot;whiff of grapeshot&quot; – on 5 October allowed Bonaparte to save the members of the National Convention. Napoleon&#x27;s later report did not mention Murat, but Napoleon did not forget him, as Murat was made a marshal, the &quot;First Horseman of Europe&quot;, Grand Duke of Berg and King of Naples.

===Italian and Egyptian campaigns===


In 1796, Joachim Murat went with Bonaparte to northern Italy, initially as his aide-de-camp, and was later named commander of the cavalry during the many campaigns against the Austrians and their allies.

Murat commanded the cavalry of the French Egyptian expedition of 1798, again under Bonaparte. On 25 July 1799 at the Battle of Abukir, he successfully led the cavalry charge that broke the Ottoman line. 

In 1799, some remaining staff officers, including Murat, and Bonaparte returned to France, eluding various British fleets in five frigates. A short while later, Murat played an important, even pivotal, role in Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;coup within a coup&quot; of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), when he first assumed political power.

Murat married Caroline Bonaparte, with whom he shared the same birthday, in a civil ceremony on 20 January 1800 at Mortefontaine and in a religious ceremony on 4 January 1802 in Paris, thus becoming a son-in-law of Letizia Ramolino as well as brother-in-law to Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte, Pauline Bonaparte and Jérôme Bonaparte.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Napoleon made Murat a Marshal of the Empire on 18 May 1804, and granted him the title of &quot;First Horseman of Europe&quot;. He was made Prince of the Empire and Admiral of the Empire in 1805, despite having very little knowledge about naval warfare. He fought in various battles, during 1805–1807, including those of Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena and Eylau, where he led a famous cavalry charge against the Russians.

After several territorial concessions made by Prussia, the Grand Duchy of Berg was set up, he was appointed Grand Duke of Berg and Duke of Cleves on 15 March 1806, and held this title until 1 August 1808, when he was named King of Naples. Murat was in charge of the French Army in Madrid when the popular Dos de Mayo Uprising, that started the Peninsular War, broke out.

Murat proved to be equally useful in the Russian campaign of 1812, where he distinguished himself as the best cavalry commander of the at battles such as Smolensk and Borodino.

Although he was a great horseman, Murat showed a total lack of concern for the well-being of the horses. Napoleon had created the greatest forage problem known in military history by putting together a cavalry of 40,000 men and horses. The long marches and the lack of rest meant that the horses suffered from hunger, bad fodder, saddle sores and exhaustion, but these factors were aggravated by Murat himself. He also failed to forge caulkin shoes for the horses to enable them in the retreat to traverse roads that had become iced over. The Polish cavalry and Caulaincourt knew this and acted accordingly.

He continued to serve Napoleon during the German Campaign of 1813. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig, Murat reached a secret agreement with the Allies in order to save his own throne and switched sides to the Coalition.

=== Neapolitan War ===
Following further military defeats, Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814. At the Congress of Vienna, Klemens von Metternich, Austria&#x27;s Foreign Minister, was bound by other coalition allies that wanted to restore Ferdinand IV of the House of Bourbon to the Neapolitan throne, particularly Britain.

With his throne no longer secure, following Napoleon&#x27;s return from exile, Murat switched sides in an unsuccessful attempt to return to Napoleon&#x27;s favour. On 15 March 1815, the Kingdom of Naples declared war on the Austrian Empire, starting the Neapolitan War. With an estimated 45,000 troops, the Neapolitan army invaded the Papal States and Tuscany. Though the Austrian army in northern Italy numbered 94,000 troops, it was widely distributed. On 30 March 1815, Murat&#x27;s troops arrived in Rimini, where they were hosted by the Battaglini counts. In a final attempt to gain allies, Murat published the Rimini Proclamation, though it may have been backdated after his military defeats.

Murat&#x27;s eastern column advanced northwards from Rimini towards the River Po, entering Bologna on 2 April, while the western column reached Florence on 8 April. On the same day, the eastern column engaged 3,000 Austrian soldiers at the Battle of Occhiobello. Following its defeat at Occhiobello, it was pushed southwards, leading to Murat&#x27;s decisive defeat at the Battle of Tolentino on 2–3 May. Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France.

==Death==
Hearing of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Murat fled to Corsica, from which he attempted an impossible invasion of Calabria. Napoleon remarked: &quot;Murat attempted to reconquer with 200 men that territory which he failed to hold when he had 80,000 at his disposal.&quot; Murat was captured, sentenced to death, and shot by firing squad in Pizzo Calabro on 13 October 1815.

<doc id="336811" wikidata="Q354883" url="?curid=336811" title="Earl Hines">
<text>Earl Kenneth Hines, also known as Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines (December 28, 1903 – April 22, 1983), was an American jazz pianist and bandleader. He was one of the most influential figures in the development of jazz piano and, according to one source, &quot;one of a small number of pianists whose playing shaped the history of jazz&quot;.

The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (a member of Hines&#x27;s big band, along with Charlie Parker) wrote,

The piano is the basis of modern harmony. This little guy came out of Chicago, Earl Hines. He changed the style of the piano. You can find the roots of Bud Powell, Herbie Hancock, all the guys who came after that. If it hadn&#x27;t been for Earl Hines blazing the path for the next generation to come, it&#x27;s no telling where or how they would be playing now. There were individual variations but the style of … the modern piano came from Earl Hines.
The pianist Lennie Tristano said, &quot;Earl Hines is the &quot;only&quot; one of us capable of creating real jazz and real swing when playing all alone.&quot; Horace Silver said, &quot;He has a completely unique style. No one can get that sound, no other pianist.&quot; Erroll Garner said, &quot;When you talk about greatness, you talk about Art Tatum and Earl Hines.&quot;

Count Basie said that Hines was &quot;the greatest piano player in the world&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Earl Hines was born in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, 12 miles from the center of Pittsburgh, in 1903. His father, Joseph Hines, played cornet and was the leader of the Eureka Brass Band in Pittsburgh, and his stepmother was a church organist. Hines intended to follow his father on cornet, but &quot;blowing&quot; hurt him behind the ears, whereas the piano did not. The young Hines took lessons in playing classical piano. By the age of eleven he was playing the organ in his Baptist church. He had a &quot;good ear and a good memory&quot; and could replay songs after hearing them in theaters and park concerts: &quot;I&#x27;d be playing songs from these shows months before the song copies came out. That astonished a lot of people and they&#x27;d ask where I heard these numbers and I&#x27;d tell them at the theatre where my parents had taken me.&quot; Later, Hines said that he was playing piano around Pittsburgh &quot;before the word &#x27;jazz&#x27; was even invented&quot;.

===Early career===
With his father&#x27;s approval, Hines left home at the age of 17 to take a job playing piano with Lois Deppe and His Symphonian Serenaders in the Liederhaus, a Pittsburgh nightclub. He got his board, two meals a day, and $15 a week. Deppe (later a member of the Detroit McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers), a well-known baritone concert artist who sang both classical and popular songs, also used the young Hines as his concert accompanist and took him on his concert trips to New York. In 1921, Hines and Deppe became the first African Americans to perform on radio.

Hines&#x27;s first recordings were accompanying Deppe – four sides recorded for Gennett Records in 1923, still in the very early days of sound recording. Only two of these were issued, one of which was a Hines composition, &quot;Congaine&quot;, &quot;a keen snappy foxtrot&quot;, which also featured a solo by Hines. He entered the studio again with Deppe a month later to record spirituals and popular songs, including &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot; and &quot;For the Last Time Call Me Sweetheart&quot;. He also accompanied Ethel Waters, describing his strategy as playing &quot;under what the artist is doing&quot; by listening &quot;to the changes she made.&quot;

In 1925, after much family debate, Hines moved to Chicago, Illinois, then the world&#x27;s jazz capital, the home of Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver. Hines started in Elite No. 2 Club but soon joined Carroll Dickerson&#x27;s band, with whom he also toured on the Pantages Theatre Circuit to Los Angeles and back.

Hines met Louis Armstrong in the poolroom of the Black Musicians&#x27; Union, local 208, on State and 39th in Chicago. Hines was 21, Armstrong 24. They played the union&#x27;s piano together. Armstrong was astounded by Hines&#x27;s avant-garde &quot;trumpet-style&quot; piano playing, often using dazzlingly fast octaves so that on none-too-perfect upright pianos (and with no amplification) &quot;they could hear me out front&quot;. Richard Cook wrote in &quot;Jazz Encyclopedia&quot; that

Armstrong and Hines became good friends and shared a car. Armstrong joined Hines in Carroll Dickerson&#x27;s band at the Sunset Cafe. In 1927, this became Armstrong&#x27;s band under the musical direction of Hines. Later that year, Armstrong revamped his Okeh Records recording-only band, Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, and hired Hines as the pianist, replacing his wife, Lil Hardin Armstrong, on the instrument.

Armstrong and Hines then recorded what are often regarded as some of the most important jazz records ever made.
In the days of 78 rpm records, recording engineers were unable to play back a take without rendering the wax master unusable for commercial release, so the band did not hear the final version of &quot;West End Blues&quot; until it was issued by Okeh a few weeks later. &quot;Earl Hines, he was surprised when the record came out on the market, &#x27;cause he brought it by my house, you know, we&#x27;d forgotten we&#x27;d recorded it&quot;, Armstrong recalled in 1956. But they liked what they heard. &quot;When it first came out&quot;, Hines said, &quot;Louis and I stayed by that recording practically an hour and a half or two hours and we just knocked each other out because we had no idea it was gonna turn out as good as it did.&quot;

The Sunset Cafe closed in 1927. Hines, Armstrong, and the drummer Zutty Singleton agreed that they would become the &quot;Unholy Three&quot; – they would &quot;stick together and not play for anyone unless the three of us were hired&quot;. But as Louis Armstrong and His Stompers (with Hines as musical director), they ran into difficulties trying to establish their own venue, the Warwick Hall Club, which they rented for a year with the management help of Lil Hardin Armstrong. Hines went briefly to New York and returned to find that Armstrong and Singleton had rejoined the rival Dickerson band at the new Savoy Ballroom in his absence, leaving Hines feeling &quot;warm&quot;. When Armstrong and Singleton later asked him to join them with Dickerson at the Savoy Ballroom, Hines said, &quot;No, you guys left me in the rain and broke the little corporation we had&quot;.

Hines joined the clarinetist Jimmie Noone at the Apex, an after-hours speakeasy, playing from midnight to 6 a.m., seven nights a week. In 1928, he recorded 14 sides with Noone and again with Armstrong (for a total of 38 sides with Armstrong). His first piano solos were recorded late that year: eight for QRS Records in New York and then seven for Okeh Records in Chicago, all except two his own compositions.

Hines moved in with Kathryn Perry (with whom he had recorded &quot;Sadie Green the Vamp of New Orleans&quot;). Hines said of her, &quot;She&#x27;d been at The Sunset too, in a dance act. She was a very charming, pretty girl. She had a good voice and played the violin. I had been divorced and she became my common-law wife. We lived in a big apartment and her parents stayed with us&quot;. Perry recorded several times with Hines, including &quot;Body and Soul&quot; in 1935. They stayed together until 1940, when Hines &quot;divorced&quot; her to marry Ann Jones Reed, but that marriage was soon &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot;.

Hines married singer &#x27;Lady of Song&#x27; Janie Moses in 1947. They had two daughters, Janear (born 1950) and Tosca. Both daughters died before he did, Tosca in 1976 and Janear in 1981. Janie divorced him on June 14, 1979, and died in 2007. However, two other children from Laurice Penn exist: Michael Gordon Penn (1960) and Sandra Penn Wilson (1962 - 2023).

===Chicago years===
On December 28, 1928 (his 25th birthday and six weeks before the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre), Hines opened at Chicago&#x27;s Grand Terrace Cafe leading his own big band, a prestigious position in the jazz world at the time. &quot;All America was dancing&quot;, Hines said, and for the next 12 years and through the worst of the Great Depression and Prohibition, Hines&#x27;s band was the orchestra at the Grand Terrace. The Hines Orchestra – or &quot;Organization&quot;, as Hines preferred it – had up to 28 musicians and did three shows a night at the Grand Terrace, four shows every Saturday and sometimes Sundays. According to Stanley Dance, &quot;Earl Hines and The Grand Terrace were to Chicago what Duke Ellington and The Cotton Club were to New York – but fierier.&quot;

The Grand Terrace was controlled by the gangster Al Capone, so Hines became Capone&#x27;s &quot;Mr Piano Man&quot;. The Grand Terrace upright piano was soon replaced by a white $3,000 Bechstein grand. Talking about those days Hines later said:

From the Grand Terrace, Hines and his band broadcast on &quot;open mikes&quot; over many years, sometimes seven nights a week, coast-to-coast across America – Chicago being well placed to deal with live broadcasting across time zones in the United States. The Hines band became the most broadcast band in America. Among the listeners were a young Nat King Cole and Jay McShann in Kansas City, who said his &quot;real education came from Earl Hines. When &#x27;Fatha&#x27; went off the air, I went to bed.&quot; Hines&#x27;s most significant &quot;student&quot; was Art Tatum.

The Hines band usually comprised 15–20 musicians on stage, occasionally up to 28. Among the band&#x27;s many members were Wallace Bishop, Alvin Burroughs, Scoops Carry, Oliver Coleman, Bob Crowder, Thomas Crump, George Dixon, Julian Draper, Streamline Ewing, Ed Fant, Milton Fletcher, Walter Fuller, Dizzy Gillespie, Leroy Harris, Woogy Harris, Darnell Howard, Cecil Irwin, Harry &#x27;Pee Wee&#x27; Jackson, Warren Jefferson, Budd Johnson, Jimmy Mundy, Ray Nance, Charlie Parker, Willie Randall, Omer Simeon, Cliff Smalls, Leon Washington, Freddie Webster, Quinn Wilson and Trummy Young.

Occasionally, Hines allowed another pianist sit in for him, the better to allow him to conduct the whole &quot;Organization&quot;. Jess Stacy was one, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole and Teddy Wilson were others, but Cliff Smalls was his favorite.

Each summer, Hines toured with his whole band for three months, including through the South – the first black big band to do so. He explained, &quot;[when] we traveled by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car to let us know when the dining room was cleared, and then we would all go in together. We couldn&#x27;t eat when we wanted to. We had to eat when they were ready for us.&quot;

In &quot;Duke Ellington&#x27;s America&quot;, Harvey G. Cohen writes:

===The birth of bebop===

In 1942, Hines provided the saxophonist Charlie Parker with his big break, although Parker was subsequently fired soon after for his &quot;time-keeping&quot; – by which Hines meant his inability to show up on time – despite Parker resorting to sleeping under the band stage in his attempts to be punctual. Dizzie Gillespie joined the same year.

The Grand Terrace Cafe had closed suddenly in December 1940; its manager, Ed Fox, disappeared. The 37-year-old Hines, always famously good to work for, took his band on the road full-time for the next eight years, resisting renewed offers from Benny Goodman to join his band as piano player.

Hines&#x27;s band encountered trouble when several of its members were drafted into the armed forces in World War II. Six were drafted in 1943 alone. As a result, on August 19, 1943, Hines had to cancel the rest of his Southern tour. He went to New York and hired a &quot;draft-proof&quot; 12-piece all-woman group, which lasted two months. Next, Hines expanded it into a 28-piece band (17 men, 11 women), including strings and French horn. Despite these wartime difficulties, Hines took his bands on tour from coast to coast, but was still able to take time out from his own band to front the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1944 when Ellington fell ill.

It was during this time (and especially during the recording ban during the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike) that late-night jam sessions with members of Hines&#x27;s band sowed the seeds for the emerging new style in jazz, bebop. Ellington later said that &quot;the seeds of bop were in Earl Hines&#x27;s piano style&quot;. Charlie Parker&#x27;s biographer Ross Russell wrote:

As early as 1940, saxophone player and arranger Budd Johnson had &quot;re-written the book&quot; for Hines&#x27;s band in a more modern style. Johnson and Billy Eckstine, Hines&#x27;s vocalist between 1939 and 1943, have been credited with helping to bring modern players into the Hines band in the transition between swing and bebop. Apart from Parker and Gillespie, other Hines &#x27;modernists&#x27; included Gene Ammons, Gail Brockman, Scoops Carry, Goon Gardner, Wardell Gray, Bennie Green, Benny Harris, Harry &#x27;Pee-Wee&#x27; Jackson, Shorty McConnell, Cliff Smalls, Shadow Wilson and Sarah Vaughan, who replaced Eckstine as the band singer in 1943 and stayed for a year.

Dizzy Gillespie said of the music the band evolved:

The links to bebop remained close. Parker&#x27;s discographer, among others, has argued that &quot;Yardbird Suite&quot;, which Parker recorded with Miles Davis in March 1946, was in fact based on Hines&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot;, which nightly served as the Hines band theme-tune.

Dizzy Gillespie described the Hines band, saying, &quot;We had a beautiful, beautiful band with Earl Hines. He&#x27;s a master and you learn a lot from him, self-discipline and organization.&quot;

In July 1946, Hines suffered serious head injuries in a car crash near Houston which, despite an operation, affected his eyesight for the rest of his life. Back on the road again four months later, he continued to lead his big band for two more years. In 1947, Hines bought the biggest nightclub in Chicago, The El Grotto, but with the declining popularity of big-band music, it soon foundered and Hines lost $30,000 ($ today).

===Rediscovery===
In early 1948, Hines joined up again with Armstrong in the &quot;Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars&quot; &quot;small-band&quot;. It was not without its strains for Hines. A year later, Armstrong became the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine (on February 21, 1949). Armstrong was by then on his way to becoming an American icon, leaving Hines to feel he was being used only as a sideman in comparison to his old friend. Discussing the difficulties, mainly over billing, Armstrong stated, &quot;Hines and his ego, ego, ego ...&quot; Three years later and to Armstrong&#x27;s annoyance, Hines left the All Stars in 1951.

Next, back as leader again, Hines took his own small combos around the United States. He started with a markedly more modern lineup than the aging All Stars: Bennie Green, Art Blakey, Tommy Potter, and Etta Jones. In 1954, he toured his then seven-piece group nationwide with the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1958, he broadcast on the American Forces Network but by the start of the jazz-lean 1960s, the aging Hines settled &quot;home&quot; in Oakland, California, with his wife and two young daughters, opened a tobacconist&#x27;s, and came close to giving up the profession.

In 1964, Stanley Dance, Hines&#x27;s determined friend and unofficial manager, convinced Hines to perform a series of recitals at the Little Theatre in New York. They were the first piano recitals Hines had ever given; they caused a sensation, leading Hines to be &quot;suddenly rediscovered&quot;. &quot;What is there left to hear after you&#x27;ve heard Earl Hines?&quot;, asked John Wilson of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Hines then won the 1966 International Critics Poll for &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame. &quot;DownBeat&quot; also elected him the world&#x27;s &quot;No. 1 Jazz Pianist&quot; in 1966 (and did so again five more times). &quot;Jazz Journal&quot; awarded his LPs of the year first and second in its overall poll and first, second and third in its piano category. &quot;Jazz&quot; voted him &quot;Jazzman of the Year&quot; and picked him for its number 1 and number 2 places in the category Piano Recordings. Hines was invited to appear on TV shows hosted by Johnny Carson and Mike Douglas.

From then until his death twenty years later, Hines recorded endlessly, both solo and with contemporaries like Cat Anderson, Harold Ashby, Barney Bigard, Lawrence Brown, Dave Brubeck (they recorded duets in 1975), Jaki Byard (duets in 1972), Benny Carter, Buck Clayton, Cozy Cole, Wallace Davenport, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Vic Dickenson, Roy Eldridge, Duke Ellington (duets in 1966), Ella Fitzgerald, Panama Francis, Bud Freeman, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Gonsalves, Stéphane Grappelli, Sonny Greer, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Milt Hinton, Johnny Hodges, Peanuts Hucko, Helen Humes, Budd Johnson, Jonah Jones, Max Kaminsky, Gene Krupa, Ellis Larkins, Shelly Manne, Marian McPartland (duets in 1970), Gerry Mulligan, Ray Nance, Oscar Peterson (duets in 1968), Russell Procope, Pee Wee Russell, Jimmy Rushing, Stuff Smith, Rex Stewart, Maxine Sullivan, Buddy Tate, Jack Teagarden, Clark Terry, Sarah Vaughan, Joe Venuti, Earle Warren, Ben Webster, Teddy Wilson (duets in 1965 and 1970), Jimmy Witherspoon, Jimmy Woode and Lester Young. Possibly more surprising were Alvin Batiste, Tony Bennett, Art Blakey, Teresa Brewer, Barbara Dane, Richard Davis, Elvin Jones, Etta Jones, the Ink Spots, Peggy Lee, Helen Merrill, Charles Mingus, Oscar Pettiford, Vi Redd, Betty Roché, Caterina Valente, Dinah Washington, and Ry Cooder (on the song &quot;Ditty Wah Ditty&quot;).

But the most highly regarded recordings of this period are his solo performances, &quot;a whole orchestra by himself&quot;. Whitney Balliett wrote of his solo recordings and performances of this time:

Hines recorded solo tributes to Armstrong, Hoagy Carmichael, Ellington, George Gershwin and Cole Porter in the 1970s, sometimes on the 1904 12-legged Steinway given to him in 1969 by Scott Newhall, the managing editor of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In 1974, when he was in his seventies, Hines recorded sixteen LPs. &quot;A spate of solo recording meant that, in his old age, Hines was being comprehensively documented at last, and he rose to the challenge with consistent inspirational force&quot;. From his 1964 &quot;comeback&quot; until his death, Hines recorded over 100 LPs all over the world. Within the industry, he became legendary for going into a studio and coming out an hour and a half later having recorded an unplanned solo LP. Retakes were almost unheard of except when Hines wanted to try a tune again in some other way, often completely different.

From 1964 on, Hines often toured Europe, especially France. He toured South America in 1968. He performed in Asia, Australia, Japan and, in 1966, the Soviet Union, in tours funded by the U.S. State Department. During his six-week tour of the Soviet Union, in which he performed 35 concerts, the 10,000-seat Kyiv Sports Palace was sold out. As a result, the Kremlin cancelled his Moscow and Leningrad concerts as being &quot;too culturally dangerous&quot;.

===Final years===
Arguably still playing as well as he ever had, Hines displayed individualistic quirks (including grunts) in these performances. He sometimes sang as he played, especially his own &quot;They Didn&#x27;t Believe I Could Do It ... Neither Did I&quot;. In 1975, Hines was the subject of an hour-long television documentary film made by ATV (for Britain&#x27;s commercial ITV channel), out-of-hours at the Blues Alley nightclub in Washington, DC. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; described it as &quot;the greatest jazz film ever made&quot;. In the film, Hines said, &quot;The way I like to play is that ... I&#x27;m an explorer, if I might use that expression, I&#x27;m looking for something all the time ... almost like I&#x27;m trying to talk.&quot; In 1979, Hines was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. He played solo at Duke Ellington&#x27;s funeral, played solo twice at the White House, for the President of France and for the Pope. Of this acclaim, Hines said, &quot;Usually they give people credit when they&#x27;re dead. I got my flowers while I was living&quot;.

Hines&#x27;s last show took place in San Francisco a few days before he died of a heart attack in Oakland. As he had wished, his Steinway was auctioned for the benefit of gifted low-income music students, still bearing its silver plaque:

:presented by jazz lovers from all over the world. this piano is the only one of its kind in the world and expresses the great genius of a man who has never played a melancholy note in his lifetime on a planet that has often succumbed to despair.

Hines was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California.

==Style==
&quot;The Oxford Companion to Jazz&quot; describes Hines as &quot;the most important pianist in the transition from stride to swing&quot; and continues:

Hines himself described meeting Armstrong:
Hines continued:

In their book &quot;Jazz&quot; (2009), Gary Giddins and Scott DeVeaux wrote of Hines&#x27;s style of the time:

In his book &quot;Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism&quot;, Thomas Brothers described Hines&#x27;s style:Rhythmically, Hines was very good at taking his melodic lines further and further way from the fixed foundation, creating a radical sense of detachment for a few beats or measures, only to land back in time with great aplomb when finished with his foray. The left hand sometimes joins in the action...What is especially distinctive about Hines are the startling effects he creates by harmonically enhancing these rhythmic departures. Like Armstrong, he thought of chords creatively and with great precision. But he was a step ahead of his colleague in his willingness to experiment. He became fond of radical dislocations, sudden turns of directions with dim and nonexistent connection to the ground harmony.Pianist Teddy Wilson wrote of Hines&#x27;s style:

Oliver Jackson was Hines&#x27;s frequent drummer (as well as a drummer for Oscar Peterson, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Teddy Wilson and many others. He described Hines&#x27;s style as follows:

&quot;The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz&quot; gives the following description of Hines&#x27;s 1965 style:

Later still, then in his seventies and after a host of recent solo recordings, Hines himself said:

<text>The prolific mathematician Paul Erdős and his various collaborators made many famous mathematical conjectures, over a wide field of subjects, and in many cases Erdős offered monetary rewards for solving them.

==Unsolved==
* The Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture on cycles with lengths equal to a power of two in graphs with minimum degree 3.
* The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture that in a family of graphs defined by an excluded induced subgraph, every graph has either a large clique or a large independent set.
* The Erdős–Mollin–Walsh conjecture on consecutive triples of powerful numbers.
* The Erdős–Selfridge conjecture that a covering system with distinct moduli contains at least one even modulus.
* The Erdős–Straus conjecture on the Diophantine equation 4/&quot;n&quot; = 1/&quot;x&quot; + 1/&quot;y&quot; + 1/&quot;z&quot;.
* The Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions in sequences with divergent sums of reciprocals.
* The Erdős–Szekeres conjecture on the number of points needed to ensure that a point set contains a large convex polygon.
* The Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases of natural numbers.
* A conjecture on quickly growing integer sequences with rational reciprocal series.

* The Erdős sumset conjecture on sets, proven by Joel Moreira, Florian Karl Richter, Donald Robertson in 2018. The proof has appeared in &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; in March 2019.
* The Burr–Erdős conjecture on Ramsey numbers of graphs, proved by Choongbum Lee in 2015.
* A conjecture on equitable colorings proven in 1970 by András Hajnal and Endre Szemerédi and now known as the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.
* A conjecture that would have strengthened the Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem to state that the number of elements in a square-difference-free set of positive integers could only exceed the square root of its largest value by a polylogarithmic factor, disproved by András Sárközy in 1978.
* The Erdős–Lovász conjecture on weak/strong delta-systems, proved by Michel Deza in 1974.

* The Erdős squarefree conjecture that central binomial coefficients C(2&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) are never squarefree for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 was proved in 1996.
* The Erdős primitive set conjecture that the sum formula_3 for any primitive set A (a set where no member of the set divides another member) attains its maximum at the set of primes numbers, proved by Jared Duker Lichtman in 2022.
* The Erdős-Sauer problem about maximum number of edges an n-vertex graph can have without containing a k-regular subgraph, solved by Oliver Janzer and Benny Sudakov

<text>The 11th Brigade (also known as the Yiftach Brigade) is a reserve unit in the Israel Defense force, composed mainly of fighters who completed their service in the Unit 621 – &#x27;Egoz&#x27;.

==History==
In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War it was a Palmach infantry brigade. It was formed in late April 1948 from existing Palmach battalions: the First Battalion, that resided in Jezreel Valley and the Third Battalion in the eastern valleys. In late 1948, the Second Palmach Battalion was transferred to it from the Negev Brigade.

The Palmach memorial website records 274 of its members being killed whilst in the Yiftach Brigade.

In May 1949 the Palmach brigade was disbanded. This was part of a general downsizing of the IDF (9 out of 12 brigades were disbanded). It was also considered by many as part of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s process of disbanding the Palmach itself.

A while after that, it was re-established as a reserve unit that served in the Gaza Strip front As an infantry brigade it also fought in the Suez Crisis and in the Six-Day War in the Gaza Strip

In 1971 the brigade was converted to an armored brigade. It fought in the Egyptian front of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. After the war it was regrouped and its unit number was changed to 576. in 2006 the brigade fought in Operation Defensive Shield.

In May 2014 it was disbanded. 

=== Reestablishment ===
In 2016, it was decided to reestablish the brigade as an elite infantry brigade in the reserves, called the &quot;Reserve Commando Brigade&quot;, based on the reserve battalions of the 810th Brigade &#x27;Hermon&#x27;, which was closed as part of the multi-year Gideon plan. Most of the soldiers off the brigade completed their service in the Egoz unit. In September 2020, the brigade transferred command to the 99th Infantry Division (&quot;Reserve&quot;), where it serves as a commando reserve force.

<doc id="336820" wikidata="Q448331" url="?curid=336820" title="Alvar">
<text>An alvar is a biological environment based on a limestone plain with thin or no soil and, as a result, sparse grassland vegetation. Often flooded in the spring, and affected by drought in midsummer, alvars support a distinctive group of prairie-like plants. Most alvars occur either in northern Europe or around the Great Lakes in North America. This stressed habitat supports a community of rare plants and animals, including species more commonly found on prairie grasslands. Lichen and mosses are common species. Trees and bushes are absent or severely stunted. 

The primary cause of alvars is the shallow exposed bedrock. Flooding and drought, as noted, add to the stress of the site and prevent many species from growing. Disturbance may also play a role. In Europe, grazing is frequent, while in North America, there is some evidence that fire may also prevent encroachment by forest. The habitat also has strong competition gradients, with better competitors occupying the deeper soil and excluding other species to less productive locations. Crevices in the limestone provide a distinctive habitat which is somewhat protected from grazing, and which may provide habitat for unusual ferns such as &quot;Pellaea atropurpurea&quot;. Bare rock flats provide areas with extremely low competition that serve as refugia for weak competitors such as the sandwort &quot;Minuartia michauxii&quot; and &quot;Micranthes virginiensis&quot;. In a representative set of four Ontario alvars, seven habitat types were described. From deep to shallow soil these were: tall grassy meadows, tall forb-rich meadows, low grassy meadows, low forb-rich meadows, dry grassland, rock margin grassland and bare rock flats. 

Alvars comprise a small percentage of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems by land extent. Although some 120 exist in the Great Lakes region, in total there are only about left across the entire Great Lakes basin, and many of these have been degraded by agriculture and other human uses. More than half of all remaining alvars occur in Ontario. There are smaller areas in New York, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Quebec.

In North America, alvars provide habitat for birds such as bobolinks, eastern meadowlarks, upland sandpipers, eastern towhees, brown thrashers and loggerhead shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere. Rare plants include Kalm&#x27;s lobelia (&quot;Lobelia kalmii&quot;), Pringle&#x27;s aster (&quot;Symphyotrichum pilosum&quot; var. &quot;pringlei&quot;), juniper sedge (&quot;Carex juniperorum&quot;), lakeside daisy (&quot;Hymenoxys acaulis&quot;), ram&#x27;s-head lady&#x27;s-slipper (&quot;Cypripedium arietinum&quot;), and dwarf lake iris (&quot;Iris lacustris&quot;). Also associated with alvars are rare butterflies and snails. The use of the word &quot;alvar&quot; to refer to this type of environment originated in Sweden. The largest alvar in Europe is located on the Swedish island of Öland. Here the thin soil mantle is only 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters thick in most places and in many extents consists of exposed limestone slabs. The landscape there has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are other more local names for similar landforms, such as a pavement barren, although this term is also used for similar landforms based on sandstone. In the United Kingdom the exposed landform is called a limestone pavement and thinly covered limestone is known as calcareous grassland.

==European alvar locations==
*Sweden
**Öland – Stora Alvaret – largest alvar extent in Europe
**Gotland
**Västergötland – several locations on limestone mountain Kinnekulle, smaller fragments on Falbygden, e.g. in Dala and Högstena parishes
*Estonia
** Alvars are distributed along the whole northern coast of Estonia from approx. the town of Paldiski to Sillamäe, wherever limestone comes to the surface near the seashore (see Baltic Klint), as well as on the islands of the West Estonian archipelago. Estonia used to be home to approximately one third of the world&#x27;s alvars; however, the total area of alvars has decreased from 43,000 hectares in the 1930s to 12,000 hectares in 2000, and approximately 9,000 hectares in 2010. Estonian alvars are home to 267 species of vascular plants, approximately one fifth of which are protected. There are also 142 species of bryophytes and 263 species of lichens. The Estonian government has committed itself to protect at least 9,800 hectares of the country&#x27;s alvars as part of the Natura 2000 network. The Loopealse subdistrict of Tallinn is named after alvar.
**Vardi Nature Reserve in Rapla County is an Estonian nature reserve especially designated to protect one of the more representative alvar areas of Estonia.
*England
**Cumbria and North Yorkshire – under protection in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan

<text>In the Book of Genesis, Zilpah ( &quot;Zīlpā&quot;, meaning uncertain) was Leah&#x27;s handmaid whom Leah gave to Jacob like a wife to bear him children (). Zilpah gave birth to two sons, whom Leah claimed as her own and named Gad and Asher ().

Zilpah was given to Leah as a handmaid by Leah&#x27;s father, Laban, upon Leah&#x27;s marriage to Jacob (see , ). According to the early rabbinical commentary Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Zilpah and Bilhah, the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, respectively, were actually daughters of Laban and one or more of his concubines. But modern scholars believe that Zilpah and Bilhah were most likely foreign, like Tamar and Asenath.

Zilpah also figured in the competition between Jacob&#x27;s wives to bear him sons. Leah stopped conceiving after the birth of her fourth son, at which point Rachel, who had not yet borne any children, offered her handmaid, Bilhah, to Jacob like a wife in order to have children through her. After Bilhah bore two sons, Leah took up the same idea and presented Zilpah to Jacob so she could have more children through her handmaid. Leah named the two sons of Zilpah and was directly involved in their upbringing.

According to Rashi, an 11th-century commentator, Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, and Laban&#x27;s decision to give her to Leah was part of the deception he used to trick Jacob into marrying Leah, who was older than Rachel. The morning after the wedding, Laban explained to Jacob, &quot;This is not done in our place, to give the younger before the older&quot; (). But at night, to mask the deception, Laban gave the veiled bride the younger of the handmaids, so Jacob would think that he was really marrying Rachel, the younger of the sisters.

In Jewish tradition, Zilpah is believed to be buried in the Tomb of the Matriarchs in Tiberias.

==In popular culture==
In the novel &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant, Zilpah and Bilhah are represented as half-sisters of Leah and Rachel by different mothers.

<doc id="336822" wikidata="Q223830" url="?curid=336822" title="Danny Trejo">
<text>Danny Trejo (, ; born May 16, 1944) is an American actor. A native of Los Angeles, Trejo&#x27;s film career began in 1985, when he landed a role in &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985). The first film in which he was given a proper credited role was as Art Sanella in &quot;Death Wish 4: The Crackdown&quot; (1987). He went on to star in a multitude of other films, many of which were small parts as inmates, gangsters, or other criminals, appearing in &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; (both 1995), &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996), &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997), &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (1998), &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; (2000), and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003), among others.

From 2001 to 2003, Trejo appeared in the Robert Rodriguez-directed &quot;&quot;Spy Kids&quot; franchise&quot; as Isador &quot;Machete&quot; Cortez. Subsequently, in 2010, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in the spin-off exploitation action film &quot;Machete&quot; as the protagonist. With the success of &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), Trejo once again reprised his role in a direct sequel, &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013).

His voice acting work includes the characters Umberto Robina for the video games &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;, himself in &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY&quot; (2004), Raul Tejada in &quot;&quot;, Trainer Duke in &quot;The Fight: Lights Out&quot;, himself in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; and &quot;Call of The Dead&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty Black Ops 4: Blackout&quot; and also himself in &quot;Far Cry 6: Danny and Dani vs. Everybody&quot;, and &quot;SCUM&quot;, among others.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Danny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, in Maywood, California. He was raised on Temple Street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son of Mexican-American parents. He is the son of Delores Rivera King and Dionisio &quot;Dan&quot; Trejo (1922–1981), a construction worker. Trejo was the result of an extramarital affair; Delores&#x27;s husband was away fighting in World War II. His parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943. He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor Delores from 1949 until 1965; his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care.

Trejo was often abused by his father. Shortly after his birth, Trejo and his family briefly lived in San Antonio, Texas; they fled Los Angeles because Dionisio was wanted by police for stabbing another man. After a year, they returned to Los Angeles and Trejo&#x27;s father turned himself in. By 1949, Trejo shared a room with his cousins at their grandmother&#x27;s house. His stepmother was Alice Mendias, &quot;his only source of comfort&quot; when he lived with his father.

Trejo was using marijuana, heroin, and cocaine by ages 8, 12, and 18, respectively.
 Trejo&#x27;s uncle Gilbert introduced him to all three and was responsible for Trejo overdosing on his first heroin fix. When he was 13, he moved to the majority Hispanic neighborhood of Pacoima, Los Angeles, where he said he did not experience racism growing up. Years later, he purchased his childhood home and often lived in it.

===Life of crime and incarceration===
At age seven, Trejo participated in his first drug deal. He was first arrested at the age of 10, but experienced his first incarceration at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in 1956.

Throughout the 1960s, Trejo&#x27;s life consisted predominantly of intermittent jail stints in the California prison system. The accounts of his prison chronology, though, are notably conflicting; by one account, his final term in custody is said to have ended in 1972. However, Trejo did time in various juvenile offenders&#x27; camps, including three years at Camp Glenn Rockey, San Dimas, for maiming a sailor (stabbing him in the face with broken glass), followed by numerous California prisons between 1959 and 1969; &quot;I was in San Quentin, Folsom, Soledad, Vacaville, Susanville, Sierra&quot;.

While doing a stint in Los Angeles County jail in 1961, he met Charles Manson, whom he described as a &quot;dirty, greasy, scrawny white boy&quot; who was allegedly a talented hypnotist.

Trejo arrived at San Quentin State Prison in 1966, and his heroin use was exacerbated shortly thereafter. He was a debt collector and drug dealer, often participating in or witnessing acts of serious violence, including murder. Simultaneously while imprisoned, Trejo focused on boxing and became a champion in San Quentin&#x27;s lightweight and welterweight divisions.

Regarding himself, Trejo has suggested his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble. In 1968, a prison riot broke out during Cinco De Mayo at Soledad. From that fracas, Trejo ended up in solitary confinement, facing capital charges and, potentially, the death penalty, after hitting a guard with a rock. While in solitary, Trejo found faith and became a member of a 12-step program, having first attended one &quot;by accident&quot; aged 15. He successfully overcame his drug addictions, recalling in 2011 that he had been sober for the previous 42 years. Also while incarcerated, he earned his high-school diploma.

In July 1969, Trejo was released from custody and returned to Pacoima, Los Angeles, having served five years of a 10-year prison sentence.

Prior to his film career, Trejo worked as a labor foreman for developer Saul Pick, and contributed toward the construction of the Cinerama Dome. He was also a gardener, salesperson, part owner of a lawn care company, and became a substance abuse counselor since 1973.

==Career==
===Film and television===
====1980s: Acting debut====

Trejo worked with Western Pacific Med Corp in the 1980s, assisting them with the establishing and operating of sober living houses within the San Fernando Valley. He met a &quot;good looking tattooed kid&quot; during a meeting in one such house, who explained that he worked as a film extra and was paid $50 per day to stand there. Intrigued, Trejo considered becoming a film extra, initially due to the easy money and publicity it could afford his work with Western Pacific Med Corp. Trejo signed with an agent and would hand out his details while working on film sets, in the hopes of finding more opportunities to help those in need. Late one night, Trejo received a call from a teenaged patient, asking for his assistance in dealing with cocaine problems on the set of &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985).

While there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film&#x27;s prison scenes. Edward Bunker, a former convict turned published crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo from their time together at San Quentin. Remembering Trejo&#x27;s boxing skills, Bunker played a pivotal role in securing Trejo as Eric Roberts&#x27; personal trainer and boxing advisor. Trejo was paid between $320 and $350 per day. Trejo recalled: &quot;When I got my first paycheck, I thought they made a mistake!&quot; Bunker also convinced director Andrei Konchalovsky to offer Trejo a small acting role, asserting that Trejo&#x27;s personal experiences of incarceration would provide authenticity to the prison drama. Following his acting debut, Trejo was oblivious to being typecast as a prisoner in similar roles for years to follow; &quot;I [did not] know I was being stereotyped. I just knew I was working.&quot;

&quot;Penitentiary III&quot; was his first billed role. While filming he met Anthony Gambino of the Gambino crime family; Gambino allegedly had financial interests invested and was there to meet the leading man, Leon Isaac Kennedy. Trejo was paid $120 cash each day, but the project often went into overtime; &quot;We were stacked with cash.&quot; On a good month, Trejo was taking home as much as $700 by 1989 from being an extra alone; yet, people often assumed he was far wealthier after a few appearances on television. Trejo says this worked to his advantage as a drug counselor, though, because clients would recognize him as an actor, therefore appreciating his presence and the humility of his work all the more.

====1990s: &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; and career progression====
Trejo had made a dozen films by 1990, including &quot;Death Wish 4: The Crackdown&quot;, and &quot;Marked for Death&quot;. He enjoyed the making of &quot;Guns&quot;, yet alleges Erik Estrada took issue with the cast and crew being more familiar with Trejo than himself. Trejo says Estrada&#x27;s ego got the better of him; he believes Estrada arranged for Trejo and a number of others to fly coach instead of first class on the way to Hawaii for filming.

In 1991, Edward James Olmos originally offered him the role of Pedro Santana in &quot;American Me&quot;. Trejo was unimpressed by the script and his initial meeting with Olmos. Trejo claims rumors began circulating within the Mexican Mafia that the script was taking narrative liberties. Before Trejo had the chance to attend a second meeting with Olmos, he received a call from Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan, the then-don of the Mexican Mafia; Morgan approved of his choosing a role in &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; instead of &quot;American Me&quot;. In 2021, Trejo stated that he believes Olmos has yet to accept him as a serious actor.

Of his experiences of &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot;, Trejo recalls feeling uncomfortable around many of the other actors during rehearsals, as they were more established. During production at San Quentin, Trejo often had flashbacks to his time there; filming scenes in C550, his former cell, merely exacerbated such feelings. Though his previous works brought him opportunities, Trejo credits &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; as having brought him &quot;legitimate, worldwide fame.&quot;

Trejo found a new talent agent with the help of Raymond Cruz. He was first cast in an episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, followed by a part in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Last Light&quot;, Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s directorial debut.

&quot;Heat&quot; went through two script revisions while Trejo read for the part. He ultimately secured the role, which reunited him with Michael Mann, who had directed him in the television miniseries &quot;Drug Wars: The Camarena Story&quot; a few years prior. Mann initially mistook Trejo for his uncle Gilbert; he found the resemblance uncanny, having met Gilbert while shooting &quot;The Jericho Mile&quot; at Folsom in the late 1970s; production required the co-operation of the inmates, and Gilbert happened to be one of the shot-callers. Trejo&#x27;s character in the film was initially called &#x27;Vince&#x27; but renamed &#x27;Trejo&#x27; in honor of Gilbert. Filming could be upward of 17 hours per day, but Trejo said he was grateful for how much he learned; &quot;watching De Niro, Kilmer, and Voight, I learned a lot about how they saved [their performances] for when it mattered.&quot; He recalls being mentored by Robert De Niro, who was a patient and instructive scene partner. Trejo and De Niro improvised the former&#x27;s death scene.

In 1996, Trejo was cast in the French production &quot;Le Jaguar&quot; (which was French for The Jaguar) and reunited with Voight for &quot;Anaconda&quot;, both of which were filmed in Manaus, Brazil. When production for &quot;Anaconda&quot; moved to Venezuela, Trejo would go out socializing on his days off. The producers were worried given a possible coup d&#x27;état had made parts of the country unsafe to travel; a group of teenagers brandished AK47&#x27;s on one occasion, demanding Trejo&#x27;s combat boots. Because of this, Trejo says he negotiated a higher salary to remain within the confines of his hotel.

Trejo described 1997&#x27;s &quot;Con Air&quot; as a &quot;macho fest from the start&quot; and the cast were often pulling pranks on one another. He remembers Nicolas Cage as being &quot;cool as hell&quot; and John Cusack as a &quot;kickboxing badass&quot;. Trejo met many of his longtime friends on set, including: John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and Dave Chappelle.

====2000s: Health scare, &quot;Spy Kids&quot; and the establishing of Isador &quot;Machete&quot; Cortez====

After concluding &quot;Animal Factory&quot; in 1999, he contracted Hepatitis C and &quot;had to drag [his] ass&quot; from Canada to Austin, Texas, to begin filming of &quot;Spy Kids&quot; in 2000. &quot;Spy Kids&quot; marked Trejo&#x27;s debut as the fictional character Isador &quot;Machete&quot; Cortez. Having already made &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; together, the opportunity to collaborate with Robert Rodriguez, Antonio Banderas, and Cheech Marin once again &quot;felt like [a] family reunion.&quot; &quot;Spy Kids&quot; provided Trejo with worldwide recognition and for the first time he was &quot;instantly recognizable&quot; among children around the globe.

By the time of &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; in 2001, his illness had progressed to the point that much of the cast had noticed his weight loss; Trejo states that his past drug use had caught up with him. He described himself as having been pale and weak throughout production, and pre-occupied with keeping his diagnosis a secret within Hollywood for fear of reprisal. Trejo was &quot;out of it&quot; and struggling to remember his lines due to prescription medication. By the time &quot;Spy Kids&quot; premiered in September 2002, Trejo had fully recovered.

Throughout the 2000s, Trejo appeared in productions including: &quot;XXX&quot;; &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;; &quot;Snoop Dogg&#x27;s Hood of Horror&quot;; &quot;Delta Farce&quot;; &quot;Grindhouse&quot;; &quot;Rob Zombie&#x27;s Halloween&quot;; &quot;Urban Justice&quot; (alongside Steven Seagal); and &quot;Valley of Angels&quot;.

==Personal life==

Trejo has been married and divorced four times and has three children.

In 1962, following his release from Youth Training School, reputedly one of California&#x27;s most notorious juvenile prisons, he met his first wife, Laura. Her parents did not approve of their relationship, and they were married in the backyard of Trejo&#x27;s family home. Trejo believes his drug use and criminal lifestyle contributed to their marriage&#x27;s demise; Laura filed for divorce during his second confinement at Youth Training School.

He was married to Debbie Schipek from 1971 to 1975, and to Joanne Discuillo from 1975 to 1978.

Trejo is a Christian.

Trejo has three children: Danny (b. 1981), actor and director Gilbert (b. 1988), and actress Danielle (b. 1990). His eldest child, nicknamed &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, is from a relationship with Diana Walton; they were together from 1978 to 1983. His latter two children are from a relationship with Maeve Crommie. They were together from 1986 to 1997, and he has also helped her raise her two sons from a subsequent relationship.

In 1997, he married Debbie Shreve; they separated in 2005 and he filed for divorce in 2009.

Trejo is a Democrat. His second cousin is filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, though the two were unaware they were related until the filming of &quot;Desperado&quot;.

Trejo battled liver cancer in 2010. In 2011, he moved to the San Fernando Valley to be closer to his mother after she sustained a knee injury; she died in 2013. Prior to this, he lived in Venice, California, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. In August 2019, he witnessed a car colliding with an SUV at an intersection and helped extract a five-year-old trapped in a child safety seat inside the overturned SUV. In reference to the incident, he was quoted saying: &quot;Everything good that has happened to me has happened as a direct result of helping someone else. Everything.&quot;

Trejo is characterized in his acting roles by his distinctive appearance; in addition to his heavily lined face, scarred from cystic acne and boxing brawls, and the long hair often in a ponytail and full mustache that he usually sports. For many roles, he also displays a large tattoo on his chest. The tattoo depicts a woman – a Charra wearing a sombrero.

Trejo is a passionate fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles FC as well as the Los Angeles Rams dating back well into their original tenure in Los Angeles. Trejo claims that as a child he used to sneak through the security fences at the LA Coliseum to watch Rams games. He frequently attends games and the team&#x27;s training camps.

During the filming of &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; at San Quentin, Trejo met Mario Castillo, a prisoner in the midst of drug addiction. Trejo helped him overcome his addiction, and they became good friends upon Castillo&#x27;s release from prison. They have since spoken together at both juvenile detention centers and recovery centers across California.

<text>The Negev Brigade (, &quot;Hativat HaNegev&quot;), originally the 12th Brigade is an Israeli reserve infantry brigade under the Sinai Division, that originally served in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==History==

===Founding and organization===
The brigade was founded in March 1948 with two battalions, the 2nd and 8th. The 7th Battalion was created in April, with the 9th Battalion being the last of the four. Yisrael Galili, the Haganah Chief of Staff, and Yigal Allon, the Palmach commander, chose Nachum Sarig to command the brigade in December 1947. The residents of the Negev and David Ben-Gurion appointed Shaul Avigur instead, without Sarig&#x27;s knowledge. After Avigur toured the Negev, he told Ben-Gurion that he would not be able to command the brigade, citing deteriorating health, and praised Sarig.

It was commanded by Nahum &quot;Sergei&quot; Sarig, which is why it was also called &quot;Sergei Brigade&quot;. It consisted of four Palmach battalions. The Negev Brigade participated in many operations in the Negev Desert, including Operation Yoav in the latter part of the war. Sarig decided to divide the Negev into two sectors, divided by the Beersheba–Gaza road, later Highway 25. Yigal Allon then named Haim Bar-Lev as the commander of the southern sector—the 8th Battalion.

The Palmach memorial website records the names of 312 of its members who died while in the Negev Brigade.

During the 1948 war, the Negev Brigade was involved in the defence of Negba, Kafr Daron, Be&#x27;erot Yitzhak and Nirim. In October 1948 the Brigade took part in the conquest of Beersheba. They were part of Operations Barak, Yoav, An Far, Horev, Uvda and Pleshet. 

In the 1967 war, the Brigade fought in the battle of Abu Agelia.

In the 2023 Gaza war the unit saw action in Beit Hanoun, the unit was later deployed in the Rafah offensive.

<text>The Independent Baptist Fellowship International (IBFI) is an Independent Baptist fellowship.

==History==
The founding of the IBFI resulted from a controversy involving Arlington Baptist College of Arlington, Texas, an affiliate of the World Baptist Fellowship (WBF) after Raymond W. Barber, then President of the WBF, lost a lawsuit against the college. The lawsuit was an attempt to force the Arlington Baptist College to recognize its parent/child relationship to the WBF, revert to its original name, Bible Baptist Seminary, and return to the original intent of its founders, J. Frank Norris and Louis Entzminger. He claimed that by seeking accreditation, the Arlington Baptist College was straying from its original purpose of training preachers. Barber moved forward with the lawsuit even though an investigator found that the Bible Baptist Seminary Board of Directors had created a new junior college in conjunction with the seminary, the seminary was allowed to die and the Arlington Baptist Junior College became the Arlington Baptist College.

Although it was not a major issue during the controversy, Barber charged the Arlington Baptist College with teaching the doctrines of grace, often called Calvinism, and said that some of its faculty members were &quot;hyper&quot; Calvinists. It was a strategy that worked, bringing together a strong following who shared his concerns. Barber&#x27;s actions resulted in his becoming a catalyst that drew 271 disenchanted pastors and missionaries together to create the new organization on May 10, 1984, at Fort Worth, Texas.

IBFI was careful to incorporate all of its institutions into one unit. It created a Bible institute, Norris Bible Baptist Institute, a monthly publication, &quot;The Searchlight&quot;, and a mission agency, all of which were under one corporation and headed by a board of directors. It elected Raymond Barber, Randy Cotton, Arvie Jernigan, Bill Slayton and Jack Warren as its first board of directors. The early years were aggressive, drawing support from 327 churches for its school, publication and 21 missionary families.

After a few years of tremendous momentum, the organization began to have internal squabbles. Barber was elected to the office of the president year after year without any challenge whatsoever. Finally, someone stood up in a meeting and nominated another pastor to that office. In a ruse, fifteen minutes before his term expired, Barber resigned. Again, his strategy worked. He was reelected by a Landslide vote. But that incident proved to be a foreshadow of things to come. In &quot;A View of the Norris Phenomenon&quot;, the author points to the common problem of egocentricity among fundamentalist leaders as the cause of IBFI&#x27;s decline. In less than seven years, Barber had badgered Jack Warren, editor of &quot;The Searchlight&quot;, and Young Houston, director of missions, into resigning.

Most of the original pastors soon left IBFI for various reasons. A new group of ministers, who were mostly anti-organizational, came into the ranks. The Bible institute became a seminary, the mission agency was reduced to a and the by-laws were replaced by a document that disenfranchised the supporting churches. Financial problems began to plague the organization and enrollment in the seminary consistently lagged between 10 and 25 students. A deal was eventually made for Crown College in Knoxville, Tennessee, to take over the seminary. Critics blame the questionable funding of an expensive building on IBFI property, called the &quot;Raymond Barber Conference Center&quot;, for the fellowship&#x27;s ultimate failure.

In its prime, Arlington Baptist College had a consistently expanding enrollment that was close to 1,000 students. Twenty-five years after the split, total enrollment for both schools was under 200 students annually.

<text>Open marriage is a form of non-monogamy in which the partners of a dyadic marriage agree that each may engage in extramarital sexual or romantic relationships, without this being regarded by them as infidelity, and consider or establish an open relationship despite the implied monogamy of marriage. There are variant forms of open marriage such as swinging and polyamory, each with the partners having varying levels of input into their spouse&#x27;s activities.

==Terminology==
A general definition of an open marriage is that there is an agreement between the two partners to have some degree of sexual interaction outside the couple. There are variant forms of open marriage, each with the partners having varying levels of input on their spouse&#x27;s activities.

The term &quot;open marriage&quot; originated in sociology and anthropology. Through the 1960s, researchers used &quot;closed marriage&quot; to indicate the practices of communities and cultures where individuals were intended to marry based upon social conventions and proscriptions, and open marriage where individuals had the ability to make their own choice of spouse.

&quot;Open Marriage: A New Life Style for Couples&quot; was a best selling book published by M. Evans &amp; Company in 1972 by Nena O&#x27;Neill and George O&#x27;Neill. It was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 40 weeks. It has been translated into 14 languages and has sold more than 35 million copies worldwide according to the publisher. The book changed the meaning of the term. The O&#x27;Neills describe open marriage as a relationship in which each partner has room for personal growth and can individually develop outside friendships, rather than focus obsessively on their couplehood and their family unit (being &quot;closed&quot;). Most of the book describes approaches to revitalizing marriage in areas of trust, role flexibility, communication, identity, and equality. Chapter 16, entitled &quot;Love Without Jealousy&quot;, devoted 20 pages to the proposition that an open marriage might possibly include some forms of sexuality with other partners. Fueled by frequent appearances of the O&#x27;Neills on television and in magazine articles, the redefinition entered popular consciousness, and open marriage became a synonym for sexually non-monogamous marriage.

In her 1977 book &quot;The Marriage Premise&quot;, Nena O&#x27;Neill advocated sexual fidelity in a chapter of that name. As she later said, &quot;The whole area of extramarital sex is touchy. I don&#x27;t think we ever saw it as a concept for the majority, and certainly it has not proved to be.&quot;

===Definitional issues===
The meaning of open marriage can vary from study to study depending on how the particular researchers have set their selection criteria.

Individuals might claim to have open marriages when their spouses would not agree. Studies and articles that interview individuals without taking their married status into account may not receive accurate information about the actual &quot;open&quot; status of the marriage. Blumstein and Schwartz asked more than 6,000 couples whether or not they had an understanding allowing sex outside their relationship. Interviewed individually, the partners in some couples gave very different responses to this question; the respective replies from one married couple were

* &quot;We&#x27;ve never spoken about cheating, but neither of us believe in it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever forgive him. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to. I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t met up with that situation.&quot; (Blumstein &amp; Schwartz, 1983, p. 287).
* &quot;Sure we have an understanding. It&#x27;s &#x27;You do what you want. Never go back to the same one.&#x27; See, that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s going to screw your mind up, to go back the second time to the same person.&quot; (Blumstein &amp; Schwartz, 1983, p. 286).

Couples may have an open marriage in principle, but not engage in extramarital sex. Studies that define open marriage by agreement alone will tend to report a higher incidence than studies that define open marriage by agreement and behavior. Spaniel and Cole found that 7 percent of couples would consider participating in an open marriage, but only 1.7 percent of couples reported having open marriages that actually included extramarital sex. 
Blumstein and Schwartz found that 15 percent of married couples share an agreement that allows extramarital sex, but only about 24 percent of men and 22 percent of women (or 6 percent and 5 percent of the total, respectively) who had such an agreement actually engaged in extramarital sex during the prior year. 
Researchers have applied open marriage in overly narrow terms, as when Hunt used it specifically to mean swinging couples who meet with other swinging couples to swap mates.

Open marriage is usually defined in terms of legally married, opposite-sex partners, and thus data collected may not generalize to other kinds of open relationships. For example, cohabiting couples tend to show higher levels of involvement in extra-relational intimacy compared to married couples. 
Gay male couples show very high levels of open relationships compared to straight couples.

There is a lack of content regarding studies and educational programming in open marriage and diverse relationship structures. Due to this, there is much uncertainty regarding the topic.

Common misconceptions of nonmonogamy include that it violates principles of all religions, and that it is equivalent to polygyny (one man having multiple wives) or polygamy (a marriage of many).

===Ideals of an open marriage===

*Here-and-now living combined with realistic expectations: There is a reduction of commitment to and sacrifice in the long-term goals.
*Personal privacy: A greater respect for personal privacy than in a traditional marriage.
*Open and honest communication: sharing, self-disclosure, and productive fighting.
*Role flexibility: open partners exhibit this considerably.
*Open companionship: avoiding traditional marriage assumptions of coupledness. This may involve the development of deep personal, sexual relationships with other members outside their marriage.
*Equality: equality of power as well as responsibility.
*Pursuit of identity: An individual&#x27;s uniqueness is valued, differences are not seen as a threat.
*Mutual trust: an assumption that everything is out on the open and that one&#x27;s partner is not a possession that is guarded.

==Relationship maintenance==
The impact of open marriage on relationships varies across couples. Some couples report high levels of marital satisfaction and have long-lasting open marriages.
Other couples drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. These couples may continue to believe open marriage is a valid way of life, just not for them.

The extent to which open marriage actually contributes to divorce remains uncertain. Blumstein and Schwartz note a slightly higher risk of divorce among couples who engage in extramarital sex, even if the couples agree to allow extramarital sex. However, Rubin and Adams did not observe any significant difference in the risk of divorce for couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages.

===Jealousy issues===
A 1981 study concluded that around 80 percent of people in open marriages experienced jealousy over their extramarital relationships. Couples in open marriages experienced as much or more jealousy than people in sexually monogamous marriages.

==Styles==

Couples in open marriages may prefer different kinds of extramarital relationships. Couples who prefer extramarital relationships emphasizing love and emotional involvement have a polyamorous style of open marriage. Couples who prefer extramarital relationships emphasizing sexual gratification and recreational friendships have a swinging style of open marriage. These distinctions may depend on psychological factors such as sociosexuality and may contribute to the formation of separate Polyamory and Swinging communities. Despite their distinctions, however, all open marriages share common issues: the lack of social acceptance, the need to maintain the health of their relationship and avoid neglect, and the need to manage jealous rivalry.

Many open couples establish rules that forbid emotional attachment, extramarital children, extramarital sex in the marital bed, extramarital sex with those known to both partners, or extramarital sex without the use of barrier contraception.

Some open marriages are one-sided. Some situations giving rise to this are where the libidos of partners differ greatly, or illness renders one partner incapable of, or no longer desiring, sex. The couple may remain together while one partner seeks out sexual gratification as he or she sees fit. The difference between these situations and a cheating situation is that both partners in the marriage are aware of, and agree to the arrangement.

===Types of openness: from &quot;polyamory style&quot; to &quot;swinging style&quot;===
Extramarital relationships vary in terms of the degree of sexual involvement desired and the degree of emotional involvement desired. Presented with the potentiality of non-monogamous intimacy, a given individual might be motivated more either by the desire for multiple sexual partners or a wider erotic experience than offered by monogamy, or by the desire for multiple others with whom to form an emotional or familial bond.

Polyamory is motivated by a desire to expand love by developing emotionally involved relationships with extramarital partners. Swinging is motivated by a desire for physical gratification by engaging in sexual activities with extramarital partners. The distinction between polyamory and swinging applies to open marriages. Delineation of polyamory and swinging has appeared in academic literature, popular media, and Web sites devoted respectively to polyamory and to swinging. (The swing sites prefer to frame the distinction more along Gould&#x27;s &quot;utopic swingers&quot; and &quot;recreational swingers&quot;.)

===Psychological basis===
The preference for a polyamorous versus a swinging style of open marriage may depend on many psychological factors. One factor may be sociosexuality, an individual&#x27;s willingness to engage in sexual behavior without having emotional ties to the sex partner. Individuals who are very willing to engage in sexual behavior without emotional ties are said to have &quot;unrestricted sociosexuality&quot;. Individuals who are very unwilling to engage in sexual behavior without emotional ties are said to have &quot;restricted sociosexuality&quot;. Individuals can vary along a continuum from unrestricted to restricted sociosexuality.

===Community implications===
Couples with different styles of open marriage tend to self-segregate in order to find others who share similar philosophies and interests, which has likely contributed to the development of separate polyamory and swinging communities. These offer informational resources and support, even if a given couple in an open marriage cannot see themselves joining either community. Some couples may not have a strong preference for either style of open marriage, feeling equally at home in either community.

The partners within a couple may differ in their respective preferences. One partner may prefer a polyamorous style of open marriage and participate in the Polyamory community, while the other partner may prefer a swinging style of open marriage and participate in the swinging community. Variations in couple preferences and individual preferences thus can result in overlap between the polyamory and swinging communities.

==Lack of acceptance==

===Christianity and other religions===
Some critics object to open marriages on the ground that open marriages violate religious principles. For example, open marriages contradict traditional Christian doctrine. Open marriages also violate the prohibition against adultery in the Ten Commandments. The definition of sexual immorality in Christianity includes the practices of open marriage and therefore it is considered an immutable reason for a dissolution of marriage. The Jewish religion hold similar values as Christianity in these matters. Muslims or Islamic teachings however allows for polygynous marriages albeit for the male partner only. Islam prohibits this practice for the female partner. The perceived validity of these objections depends entirely on individual faith. Arguments about faith and rationality lie outside the scope of this article. Generally, non-monogamous people tend not to be very religious. A 1998 review observed that, across the various studies, most swingers (approximately two-thirds) claimed to have no religious affiliation.

===Evidence of disapproval===
Surveys show consistently high disapproval of extramarital sex. Hunt mentions three general-population surveys conducted in the 1960s in which large majorities disapproved of extramarital sex under any conditions. More recent surveys show that 75–85 percent of adults in the United States disapprove of extramarital sex.
Similar levels of disapproval are observed in other Western societies. Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb surveyed over 33,500 people in 24 nations and found 85 percent of people believed extramarital sex was &quot;always&quot; or &quot;nearly always&quot; wrong. Much of the disapproval is attributed to &quot;religious and moral reasons.&quot;

A few studies have shown more direct disapproval of open marriage. In a national study of several hundred women and men, Hunt (1974) reported that around 75 percent of women and over 60 percent of men agreed with the statement &quot;Mate-swapping is wrong.&quot; A 1975 study of several hundred men and women living in the midwestern United States found that 93 percent would not consider participating in swinging.
A 2005 study asked 111 college women about various forms of marriage and family.
These young women viewed open marriage as one of the least desirable forms of marriage, with 94 percent saying they would never participate in a marriage where the man has a right to sex outside the marriage, and 91 percent saying they would never participate in a marriage where the woman has a right to sex outside the marriage.

===Health concerns===
Studies in the 1970s found that engaging in sex with a greater number of partners increases risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. These concerns do not apply to open marriage alone, which would affect only 1 to 6 percent of the married population. A 1985 study found that 33 percent of male swingers and 10 percent of female swingers claimed to actively fear this risk.
In a 1992 study, sexually transmitted diseases topped the list of disadvantages of swinging, and 58 percent of swingers expressed some fear of HIV/AIDS.
In the 1990s some couples decided to drop out of open marriage lifestyles and become sexually monogamous in response to HIV/AIDS.

A 1998 study found that the risk of sexually transmitted diseases can be greatly reduced by practicing safer sex. However, the percentage of people in open marriages who practice safer sex remained disputed. Anecdotal observations ranged from claiming no one at a swing event practiced safer sex to claiming everyone at an event practiced safer sex. A survey of swingers found that &quot;Over 62% said that they had changed their behaviors because of the AIDS scare. The two most frequently mentioned changes were being more selective with whom they swung and practicing safer sex (e.g., using condoms). Almost 7% said they had quit swinging because of the AIDS epidemic. Finally, one third said that they had not changed any of their habits, and, of these respondents, more than a third said nothing, not even AIDS, would get them to change.&quot;

===Psychological factors===
Several authors considered open marriages to be psychologically damaging. They claimed sexual non-monogamy proves too difficult for most couples to manage, and their relationships suffer as a consequence.

Studies in the 1980s found that couples report high levels of satisfaction and enjoy long-lasting open marriages. A 1995 study found that some couples drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. These couples may continue to view open marriage as a valid lifestyle for others, but not for themselves.
A 1974 study found that other couples experience problems and report that open marriage contributed to their divorces.

===Loss of social support===
Strong social disapproval of open marriage may lead to a loss of psychological and health benefits. People in open marriages may hide their lifestyle from family, friends, and colleagues.
Blumstein and Schwartz note:

Keeping their lifestyles secret reduces the amount of social support available to people in open marriages.

==Incidence==
In 1983, Blumstein and Schwartz determined that out of 3,498 married men, 903 had an agreement with their spouses allowing extramarital sex; of these, 24 percent (217 men) actually engaged in extramarital sex during the previous year, and overall 6 percent had been actively involved in open marriages during the previous year. The number is only slightly less for women, where of 3,520 married women, 801 had an agreement with their spouses allowing extramarital sex, and 22 percent (or 176 women) actually engaged in extramarital sex during the previous year. This means about 5 percent of married women were actively involved in open marriages during the previous year.

Those estimates are slightly higher than those from other researchers. Hunt, based on interviews from a 1974 national study of sexual behavior, estimated that 2% to 4% of the married population was involved in open marriages. 
Bartell (1971) estimated that two percent of the married population was involved in open marriages. 
The lowest estimate comes from a study conducted by Spanier and Cole (1975) of several hundred people living in the midwestern United States, which found 1.7 percent of married people involved in open marriages.

Following the 1972 publication of &quot;Open Marriage&quot;, the popular media expressed a belief that open marriages were on the rise. However, Hunt concluded the incidence of extramarital sex had remained about the same for many years:

Hunt attributed the mistaken impression of increasing open marriages to a barrage of books, articles, and television shows dealing with the topic. He also notes that speculative comments about increases in open marriage would sometimes be repeated often enough that people cited them as evidence.

Nearly twenty years later (1993), in a national study of sexual behavior, Janus and Janus likewise denied that open marriages were on the rise, and suggested the number of open marriages may have declined:

A large amount of media interest can mislead people into thinking the incidence of open marriage is on the rise. Conversely, media attention given to the marriage movement can mislead people into thinking the incidence of open marriage is declining. Weiss (1997) notes that &quot;there is no scientific basis for concluding that these patterns increased in popularity earlier or that they have become less common in the 1980s and 1990s.&quot;

==History==
CNS was established in 1952 as a successor to the CCP&#x27;s International News Agency. It has news offices and stations in every province in mainland China, as well as in Hong Kong and Macau. CNS also has news offices in foreign countries, including the United States, Japan, France, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. According to the Jamestown Foundation, CNS is &quot;the CCP&#x27;s main propaganda organ targeting overseas Chinese.&quot;

In 1990, CNS personnel were dispatched to the U.S. to found SinoVision and &quot;The China Press&quot; to counter negative perceptions of the Chinese government following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.

Since 2001, CNS has held a biannual Global Chinese Language Media Forum in China (also known as World Chinese Language Media Forum), a large global summit of Chinese media leaders. In 2007, CNS established the China News Service Overseas Center, which provides news reports, editorials, and layout for overseas Chinese media outlets. In 2009, CNS established the Global Chinese Media Cooperative Union (GCMCU), which redistributes CNS and other Chinese state media content to other Chinese-language media outlets. In Europe, newspapers and outlets such as &quot;Nouvelles d’Europe&quot; in France, &quot;Cine in Italia&quot; in Italy, &quot;Ouhua News&quot; in Spain, the &quot;Prague Chinese Times&quot; in the Czech Republic, and &quot;EurAsia Info&quot; in Switzerland carry CNS content.

In 2014, CNS published an editorial which derided outgoing American ambassador to China Gary Locke. The editorial was widely criticized both within China and internationally for referring to the Chinese American ambassador as a banana which was interpreted as a racial slur. The article also mocked his Mandarin Chinese abilities and said that his ancestors would disown him if they knew about his loyalties.

In 2017, a former editor-in-chief and Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of CNS until February 2015, Liu Beixian, was charged with taking bribes during the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping and expelled from the CCP.

In 2018, CNS became part of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) when its host organization, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, was folded into the UFWD. The same year, a deputy head of the UFWD stated that &quot;[a]s an important propaganda unit of the United Front, CNS must adhere to the concept of ‘newspapers run by politicians’ and thoroughly carry out political awareness work. CNS&#x27;s important mission is to do good united front propaganda work within Overseas Chinese affairs.&quot;

In 2019, CNS began a campaign to increase its influence on overseas social media. According to NPR and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, CNS was involved in targeted disinformation and propaganda campaigns during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. That year, CNS released a public tender to increase its Twitter followers. According to a 2020 investigation by ProPublica, CNS hired a third-party firm to create fake Twitter accounts to spread conspiracy theories and disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2020, the United States Department of State designated China News Service, along with other Chinese state media outlets, as a foreign mission.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, CNS repeated unsubstantiated Russian state media claims that the Bucha massacre was staged. In 2023, cybersecurity researchers found that CNS had established sock puppet accounts on Twitter for influence operations in Latin America.

== Activities ==

=== Film and television production ===
During the early stages of CNS&#x27;s establishment, a film team was created under Liao Chengzhi&#x27;s guidance, led by Wu Jiang and others. From the 1950s onwards, numerous documentaries and operas, including &quot;North and South of Taishan&quot;, &quot;Heroes of Qilu&quot;, &quot;Sisters Get Married Easily&quot; and &quot;The Pearl Pagoda&quot;, were produced and distributed in Hong Kong, Macau and overseas.

In 1979, CNS&#x27;s business departments underwent reconstruction. Following Liao Chengzhi&#x27;s instruction to revive the agency&#x27;s film work, a team of professionals from Beijing film production institutions were transferred by the agency&#x27;s leadership to expand the film team into a dedicated department. This led to the establishment of the &quot;Nanhai Film Company&quot;, with Wu Jiang as its chairman. In 1981, CNS produced its inaugural feature film, &quot;The Wilderness&quot;, under the banner of &quot;Nanhai Film Company.&quot;

Beginning with the film &quot;The Savage Land&quot;, the Film Department of the China News Agency (expanded to become the Film and Video Department in 1985) has since produced feature films and film documentaries, starring actors such as Liu Xiaoqing, Chen Baoguo, Pu Cunxin, Jiang Wen, and Ge You. The Department of Film Sound and Video has also worked with professionals from Changchun Film Studio, Beijing Film Studio and Shanghai Film Studio.

=== Video ===
In April 2007, CNS officially released a television news release called &quot;China News Video&quot;. In October 2007, CNS and Sina Corporation signed a strategic cooperation agreement, and &quot;China News Video&quot; debuted on Sina.

In July 2010, CNS adjusted the business of its Film and Television Department and set up a new Video News Department, positioning video news as the &quot;third channel news&quot;, and using China News Service website as the basic communication platform to promote video interviews, and launching a column called &quot;Focus on Net Affairs&quot;. Since its establishment in 2010, the department has been involved in the coverage of major events such as the &quot;Two Sessions&quot;, the 2010 Yushu earthquake, Expo 2010, the 2010 Gansu mudslide, the 2010 Asian Games, and the 2012 Summer Olympics.

=== Publications ===
CNS publishes China Newsweek, Fengya and World Chinese Media Yearbook in China, and China Digest (monthly) in Hong Kong, and runs the Hong Kong China News Press.

CNS controls the &quot;Chinese New Zealand Herald&quot;, which is co-owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment.

== Commentary ==
According to scholars Filip Jirouš and Petra Ševčíková, &quot;CNS&#x27;s activity lies at the symbiotic intersection of propaganda and united front work.&quot; They state that such a symbiosis helps the CCP to shape the &quot;information landscape&quot; to better serve the party&#x27;s policy goals.

<text>Euronext N.V. (short for European New Exchange Technology) is a European bourse that provides trading and post-trade services for a range of financial instruments.

Traded assets include regulated equities, exchange-traded funds (ETF), warrants and certificates, bonds, derivatives, commodities, foreign exchange as well as indices. By the end of 2024, Euronext operates over 2,000 listed issuers with a market capitalization of approximately €6.9 trillion.

Euronext is the largest center for debt and funds listings in the world, and provides technology and managed services to third parties. In addition to its main regulated market, it operates Euronext Growth and Euronext Access, providing access to listing for small and medium-sized enterprises. Euronext Paris accounts for more than 80% of Euronext’s total market cap.

Euronext also plays a key role in commodities trading, offering markets for power through Nord Pool and for fish through Fish Pool, alongside other agricultural commodities such as milling wheat and rapeseed.

Post-trade services include clearing performed by Euronext&#x27;s multi-asset clearing house, Euronext Clearing, headquartered in Rome, as well as custody and settlement performed by Euronext&#x27;s central securities depository (CSD), Euronext Securities.

Euronext is registered in Amsterdam but its operational headquarters are located in Paris. It operates major stock exchanges in seven countries: France (Euronext Paris), the Netherlands (Euronext Amsterdam), Belgium (Euronext Brussels), Ireland (Euronext Dublin), Portugal (Euronext Lisbon), Italy (Borsa Italiana) and Norway (Euronext Oslo Børs).

With the acquisition of Borsa Italiana, Euronext has strengthened its position as a hub for debt and fixed income markets across Europe, particularly through the addition of MTS and Monte Titoli, Italy’s leading central securities depository.

Euronext traces its origins back to the world&#x27;s first bourses, formed in the Low Countries&#x27; shifting trade centres, Bruges, Antwerp and Amsterdam in 1285, 1485 and 1602, respectively, as well as to the foundation of the Paris Bourse in 1724. In its present form, Euronext was established in September 2000 through the merger of the bourses in Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. The goal was to create a single, integrated, and liquid market for securities trading across Europe. Since its inception, Euronext has continued to expand, and now operates stock exchanges in several European countries, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, and Norway. Its creation was followed by the introduction of the single currency and harmonisation of financial markets.

The present day Euronext was spun off from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2014, shortly after ICE&#x27;s acquisition of NYSE Euronext the year before.

On 23 August 2023, the company formed EuroCTP as a joint venture with 13 other bourses, in an effort to provide a consolidated tape for the European Union, as part of the Capital Markets Union proposed by the European Commission.

===Financial information===
==History==

===Background: Exchange companies that merged into Euronext===


=== 2000–2007: Founding merger and early acquisitions===
In 1998, the London Stock Exchange and announced their intention of forming an alliance to fend off competition from the United States, and take advantage from the European Union&#x27;s (EU) single currency and harmonisation of financial markets. In April 1999 the stock exchanges in Paris, Zurich, Madrid, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Milan signed a memorandum of understanding in Madrid, which formalised plans to include these bourses as well.

Ultimately, only three decided to proceed, and on 22 September 2000 Euronext was formed following a merger of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Brussels Stock Exchange, and Paris Bourse.

In 2001, Euronext became a listed company itself after completing its initial public offering.

In December 2001, Euronext acquired the shares of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE), forming Euronext.LIFFE.

In 2002, the group merged with the Portuguese stock exchange Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto (BVLP), renamed Euronext Lisbon.

In 2003, Euronext cash products were integrated onto a single platform (NSC).

In 2004, Euronext derivatives products were integrated onto &quot;LIFFE CONNECT&quot;.

In 2005, Euronext introduced Alternext as a market segment to help finance small and mid-class companies in the Eurozone.

===2007–2014: Merger with the New York Stock Exchange and acquisition by Intercontinental Exchange===


Due to apparent moves by NASDAQ to acquire the London Stock Exchange or Euronext itself, NYSE Group, owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), offered €8 billion (US$10.2b) in cash and shares for Euronext on 22 May 2006, outbidding a rival offer for the European Stock exchange operator from , the German stock market. Contrary to statements that it would not raise its bid, on 23 May 2006, unveiled a merger bid for Euronext, valuing the pan-European exchange at €8.6 billion (US$11b), €600 million over NYSE Group&#x27;s initial bid. Despite this, NYSE Group and Euronext penned a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval. The initial regulatory response by SEC chief Christopher Cox (who was coordinating heavily with European counterparts) was positive, with an expected approval by the end of 2007.

 dropped out of the bidding for Euronext on 15 November 2006, removing the last major hurdle for the NYSE Euronext transaction. A run-up of NYSE Group&#x27;s stock price in late 2006 made the offering far more attractive to Euronext&#x27;s shareholders.
On 19 December 2006, Euronext shareholders approved the transaction with 98.2% of the vote. Only 1.8% voted in favour of the offer. Jean-François Théodore, the chief executive officer of Euronext, stated that they expected the transaction to close within three or four months.
Some of the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the merger had already given approval. NYSE Group shareholders gave their approval on 20 December 2006.
The merger was completed on 4 April 2007, forming NYSE Euronext.

The new firm, NYSE Euronext, was headquartered in New York City, with European operations and its trading platform run out of Paris. Then-NYSE CEO John Thain, who was to head NYSE Euronext, intended to use the combination to form the world&#x27;s first global stock market, with continuous trading of stocks and derivatives over a 21-hour time span. In addition, the two exchanges hoped to add Borsa Italiana (the Milan stock exchange) into the grouping.

In 2008 and 2009 made two unsuccessful attempts to merge with NYSE Euronext. Both attempts did not enter into advanced steps of merger. In 2011, and NYSE Euronext confirmed that they were in advanced merger talks. Such a merger would create the largest exchange in history. The deal was approved by shareholders of NYSE Euronext on 7 July 2011, and on 15 July 2011 and won the antitrust approved by the US regulators on 22 December 2011. On 1 February 2012, the deal was blocked by European Commission on the grounds that the new company would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges. unsuccessfully appealed this decision.

In 2012, Euronext announced the creation of Euronext London to offer listing facilities in the UK. As such, Euronext received in June 2014 Recognized Investment Exchange (RIE) status from Britain&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority.

On 20 December 2012, the boards of directors of both Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock. The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE&#x27;s business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked. ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris. The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of ICE. ICE CEO Jeffrey Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president. The future of the New York Stock Exchange&#x27;s historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions, the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.

In May 2013, Euronext established Enternext as a subsidiary to help small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) listed on Euronext outline and apply a strategy most suited to support their growth.

The ICE&#x27;s deal was approved by the shareholders of NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange on 3 June 2013.
The European Commission approved the acquisition on 24 June 2013 
and on 15 August 2013 the US regulator, SEC, granted approval of the acquisition.
European regulators and ministries of Finance of the participating countries approved the deal and on 13 November 2013 the acquisition was completed.

===2014–present: Spin-off from ICE and subsequent development===

Part of ICE&#x27;s deal to acquire NYSE Euronext was a spin-off for Euronext, which was considered a positive element for European stakeholders. After a complex series of operations, this occurred on 20 June 2014, through an initial public offering (IPO). The former Euronext.LIFFE was retained by ICE and renamed &quot;ICE Futures Europe&quot;. In order to stabilise Euronext, a consortium of eleven investors decided to invest in the company as &quot;reference shareholders&quot;. These investors owned 33.36% of Euronext&#x27;s capital and have a 3 years lockup period: Euroclear, BNP Paribas, BNP Paribas Fortis, Société Générale, Caisse des Dépôts, BPI France, ABN Amro, ASR, Banco Espírito Santo, Banco BPI and Belgian holding public company (SFPI/FPIM). They have 3 board seats.

In June 2014, EnterNext launched two initiatives to boost SME equity research and support the technology sector. EnterNext partnered with Morningstar to increase equity research focusing on mid-size companies, especially in the telecommunications, media and technology (TMT) sector.

On 22 September 2014, Euronext announced a partnership with DEGIRO regarding the distribution of retail services of Euronext. Upon publishing the third quarter results for 2014, the partnership was seen as a plan for Euronext to compete more effectively on the Dutch retail segment.

In May 2017, Alternext was renamed to Euronext Growth.

On 14 August 2017, Euronext announced the completion of its acquisition of FastMatch, a currency trading platform.

On 27 March 2018, Euronext announced the completion of its acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange, rebranded as Euronext Dublin, to expand its reach into the debt and funds markets.

On 18 June 2019, Euronext announced the completion of its acquisition of the Oslo Stock Exchange.

On 5 December 2019, Euronext announced that it would acquire 66% of the European power exchange Nord Pool. The acquisition was completed on 15 January 2020.

On 23 April 2020, Euronext announced that it would acquire ca. 70% of the Danish Central Securities Depository, VP Securities. The acquisition was completed on 4 August 2020.

On 18 September 2020, as part of regulatory remedies to see through its $27 billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) entered into exclusive talks to sell the Italian Bourse (formally 100% of &quot;London Stock Exchange Group Holdings Italia S.p.A.&quot;), situated in Milan, to Euronext. As part of the deal, CDP Equity, 100% owned by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and Intesa Sanpaolo would become Euronext reference shareholders.

In April 2021, Euronext completed the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group for €4.4 billion, enhancing its leadership in the European financial markets. This acquisition integrated the Milan Stock Exchange (Borsa Italiana) and its subsidiary MTS, a leader in fixed income markets, into Euronext. As of 2024, Euronext has further consolidated its market position through technological advancements, partnerships, and sustainability initiatives.

On 23 August 2023, Euronext formed EuroCTP as a joint venture with 13 other bourses, in an effort to provide a consolidated tape for the European Union, as part of the Capital Markets Union proposed by the European Commission.

In November 2024, Euronext announced a new three-year strategic plan titled &quot;Innovate for Growth 2027&quot;, aimed at accelerating revenue growth through innovation and business diversification. The plan focuses on three main priorities:

# Growth in non-volume-related activities: expansion of post-trade services, data solutions, and technology services, which currently account for 60% of total revenues.
# Expansion in fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) markets: enhancing trading and clearing capabilities, with a particular focus on the energy market through Nord Pool.
# Leadership in equity trading: strengthening Euronext&#x27;s dominant position in equity markets and becoming the leading ETF market in Europe.

Commitments to ESG and Innovation

Euronext has reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability by setting a Net Zero target for 2027. Additionally, it aims to enhance operational efficiency through the adoption of artificial intelligence and scaling its operational model.

Financial Growth and Capital Allocation Policy

The strategic plan targets an annual revenue and income growth of over 5%, with capital expenditure (CAPEX) estimated between 4% and 6% of total revenues. Euronext also announced a share buyback program of up to €300 million, set to be completed within a maximum of 12 months starting in November 2024.

<doc id="336838" wikidata="Q3686826" url="?curid=336838" title="Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture">
<text>In graph theory, the unproven Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture, made in 1995 by mathematician Paul Erdős and his collaborator András Gyárfás, states that every graph with minimum degree 3 contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of two. Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many conjectures of Erdős.

If the conjecture is false, a counterexample would take the form of a graph with minimum degree three having no power-of-two cycles. It is known through computer searches of Gordon Royle and Klas Markström that any counterexample must have at least 17 vertices, and any cubic counterexample must have at least 30 vertices. Markström&#x27;s searches found four graphs on 24 vertices in which the only power-of-two cycles have 16 vertices. One of these four graphs is planar; however, the Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture is now known to be true for the special case of 3-connected cubic planar graphs 

Weaker results relating the degree of a graph to unavoidable sets of cycle lengths are known: there is a set &quot;S&quot; of lengths, with |&quot;S&quot;| = O(&quot;n&quot;0.99), such that every graph with average degree ten or more contains a cycle with its length in &quot;S&quot; , and every graph whose average degree is exponential in the iterated logarithm of &quot;n&quot; necessarily contains a cycle whose length is a power of two . The conjecture is also known to be true for planar claw-free graphs and for graphs that avoid large induced stars and satisfy additional constraints on their degrees .

<text>The Pnyx (; ; , &quot;Pnyka&quot;) is a hill or hillside in central Athens, the capital of Greece. Beginning as early as 507 BC (Fifth-century Athens), the Athenians gathered on the Pnyx to host their popular assemblies, thus making the hill one of the earliest and most important sites in the creation of democracy.

The Pnyx is located less than west of the Acropolis and about 2 km south-west of the Syntagma Square in the centre of Athens. The &quot;mainly natural hollow&quot; was first used from before 500 BC to perhaps 404 BC, when the arrangement was changed by adding a retaining wall below the speakers&#x27; platform, with the space between filled with earth.

The Pnyx was probably the prototype for the Greek theatre auditorium, with the late form perhaps reflecting changes in theatre design.

==Historical significance==
The Pnyx was used for popular assemblies in Athens as early as 507 BC, when the reforms of Cleisthenes transferred political power to the citizenry. It was then outside the city proper, but close enough to be convenient. It looks down on the ancient Agora, which was the commercial and social centre of the city.

At this site all the great political struggles of Athens of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; were fought out. Pericles, Aristides and Alcibiades spoke here, within sight of the Parthenon, temple of Athena. Here Demosthenes delivered his vilifications of Philip II of Macedon.

==The area==
The Pnyx is a small, rocky hill surrounded by parkland, with a large flat platform of eroded stone set into its side, and by steps carved on its slope. It was the meeting place of one of the world&#x27;s earliest known democratic legislatures, the Athenian  (assembly), and the flat stone platform was the , the &quot;stepping stone&quot; or speakers&#x27; platform. This was the oratorical platform from which noted politicians such as Pericles and orators &quot;fulmined over Greece.&quot; Some scholars note that the environs and position of the Pnyx as well as its openness and objects of appeal, provided the ancient Greek speakers with the inspiration that not even the Roman Forum could rival. It is described as a result of previous reforms that included the utilization of demography and topography for the purpose of serving the interests of a rhetorical culture.

As such, the Pnyx is the material embodiment of the principle of (), &quot;equal speech&quot;, i.e. the equal right of every citizen to debate matters of policy. The other two principles of democracy were (), equality under the law, and {{transliteration|el|isopoliteía} ({{langx|el|ἰσοπολιτεία}}), equality of vote and equal opportunity to assume political office. The right of {{transliteration|el|isēgoría}} was expressed by the presiding officer of the Pnyx assembly, who formally opened each debate with the open invitation &quot;{{transliteration|el|Tís agoreúein boúletai}}?&quot; ({{langx|el|Τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται}}, &quot;Who wishes to speak to the Popular Assembly?&quot;).

The Pnyx was protected by a defense wall built in the fourth century BC and reconstructed a century later. The new walls, made of almost solid masonry and ashlar blocks, were two-meter thick. The stretch began on a northern end with a tower that stood south of the Melitides Gate of the Themistoclean Wall and ended at the western end of the summit where it joined the Diateichisma. The wall featured seven towers set with 40-meter interval while the connecting walls were strengthened by buttresses.

==Early history and phases==
The Pnyx was the official meeting place of the Athenian democratic assembly ({{langx|grc|ἐκκλησία, ekklesía}}). In the earliest days of Athenian democracy (after the reforms of Kleisthenes in 508 B.C.), the ekklesia met in the Agora. Sometime in the early 5th century, the meeting place was moved to a hill south and west of the Acropolis. This new meeting place came to be called &quot;Pnyx&quot; (from the Greek word meaning &quot;tightly packed together&quot;). 

In the early history of the Pnyx, three phases can be distinguished:

Pnyx I: Probably constructed in the early 5th century B.C.. The people apparently sat on the hillside facing a speaker&#x27;s platform on the north. The seating capacity may have been anywhere from 6,000 to 13,000 people. This phase is represented archaeologically only by a few cuttings in the bedrock and a boundary stone (not found in situ), so that it is impossible to determine the date and size with any precision. 

Pnyx II: Probably late 5th century B.C. In this phase the orientation of the auditorium was apparently reversed (a reconstruction that is based more upon ancient literary sources than from the actual archaeological record). A stepped terrace wall was created on the north to support an artificial terrace, and the people sat facing a speaker&#x27;s platform on the south. Some sources stated that this retaining wall was constructed around 500 BC for the purpose of holding the soil that was brought in to form the level space for the bema. Part of the stepped terrace wall is preserved, as well as a staircase with rock-cut steps leading up to it from the direction of the Agora. The size of the auditorium (as it is restored by the excavators) is not that much larger than Pnyx I. 
Pnyx III: The Pnyx was rebuilt and expanded in the 3rd quarter of the 4th century B.C., probably around 345-335 B.C. A massive, curved, retaining wall was built (or at least begun) on the north. The southern side of the auditorium and speaker&#x27;s platform (bema) were quarried out of the natural bedrock. (Traces of the quarrying process can still be seen at the eastern side of the great rock-cut scarp). On a terrace above (south of) the speaker&#x27;s platform, the foundations were begun for 2 long stoas (but these seem never to have been finished). It is unknown for how many years Pnyx III was used as the meeting place of the ekklesia, and certainly by the 1st century B.C. the assembly held their meetings in the Theater of Dionysos on the South Slope of the Acropolis.

Finally, in the Roman period, part of the Pnyx was used as a sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos. Evidence for the sanctuary consist of c. 50 niches for votive plaques cut into the bedrock scarp east of the speaker&#x27;s platform. Many of the votive plaques are carved with representations of human body parts (eyes, breasts, etc.), suggesting that this Zeus Hypsistos was a healing divinity.

==Athenian democracy==
{{Main|Athenian democracy}}
Scholars such as Mogens Herman Hansen suggest the Pnyx was able to hold about 6,000 citizens, though later expansions may have accommodated 8,000 or as many as 13,000. French classical scholar Robert Flacelière states that the Pnyx had enough standing room for as many as 20,000 citizens, though this is disputed. The grassy area in front of the &quot;bema&quot; was in ancient times an area of bare rock, on which about 6,000 men could stand. This can be taken as a reasonable estimate of the number of politically active citizens (citizens were free males born in the city, or perhaps 20% of the adult population). There were wooden seats for the members of the Council of 500, who were selected by lot for terms of a single year to run the city on a day-to-day basis, and prepare the agenda for the Assembly. In later times two &quot;stoae&quot;, or covered galleries, were built to protect the dignitaries against the rain and sun.

In theory, all citizens were equal and all of the male citizens had the right to speak. In practice, relatively few citizens actually spoke or proposed actions. A citizen who made a proposal might be subjected to a future prosecution (graphe paranomon) if the proposal was illegal or came to be seen as detrimental to Athens. There was a rule that citizens aged over 50 had a right to be heard first.

Democratic government at Athens was suspended in 411 BC and again in 404 BC with the assumption of power by oligarchies during crises in the Peloponnesian War. The Spartans and their allies in Athens installed a dictatorship, called the Thirty Tyrants, but in 403 BC the democrats seized power again and the meetings at the Pnyx resumed. Athens lost its independence to Philip II of Macedon after the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC; but they continued to run their internal affairs democratically until the coup by Demetrius of Phaleron in 322 BC. After his fall, the Athenians continued to run their internal affairs according to democratic forms for centuries.

==Excavations==
Excavations at the site were begun in 1910 by the Greek Archaeological Society and definitely confirmed the site as the Pnyx. Large-scale excavations were conducted at various times between 1930 and 1937 by Homer Thompson, in collaboration first with K. Kourouniotes and later with Robert Scranton.

These excavations discovered the foundations of the important buildings at the Pnyx, although nothing else remains of them. These included the two large stoas, erected between 330 and 326 BC, the Altar of Zeus Agoraios, erected at the same time, but removed during the reign of Augustus (first century BC), and the Sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos. Most of these buildings were erected after the Pnyx had lost its real significance.

West to the Altar of Zeus are the foundations of Meton&#x27;s heliotropion, the oldest known astronomical observatory, where he performed several of his measurements that led to the calculations involving the eponymous 19-year Metonic cycle which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar, a calendar that appears in the Antikythera Mechanism.

Today the site of the Pnyx is under the control of the Ephorate of Prehistorical and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture. The surrounding parkland is fenced, but can be visited free of charge at any time.

<doc id="336846" wikidata="Q267721" url="?curid=336846" title="Grease (film)">
<text>Grease is a 1978 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Randal Kleiser (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Bronté Woodard and an adaptation by co-producer Allan Carr, based on the 1972 stage musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. The film depicts the lives of greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Australian transfer student Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John), who develop an attraction for each other during a summer romance.

&quot;Grease&quot; was released in the United States on June 16, 1978, by Paramount Pictures. The film was successful both critically and commercially, becoming the highest-grossing musical film at the time. Its ended 1978 as the second-best-selling album of the year in the United States, only behind the soundtrack of the 1977 film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which also starred Travolta, and the song &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 51st Academy Awards. The film also received five nominations at the 36th Golden Globe Awards, including for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and two for Best Original Song, for &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the One that I Want&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Grease&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Grease 2&quot;, was released in 1982, starring Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer as a newer class of greasers. Few of the original cast members reprised their roles. As of 2023, a short-lived prequel television series, &quot;&quot;, debuted on Paramount+, with a prequel film, titled &quot;Summer Lovin″&quot;, currently in production.

==Plot==
In the summer of 1958, local boy Danny Zuko and vacationing Australian Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love. When the summer comes to an end, Sandy frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is &quot;only the beginning&quot;.

At the start of the seniors&#x27; term at Rydell High School, Danny resumes his role as leader of the T-Birds greaser gang consisting of Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and his best friend Kenickie. Sandy&#x27;s parents remain in America and enroll Sandy at Rydell where she meets greaser girl clique the Pink Ladies consisting of Frenchy, Marty, Jan and leader Rizzo.

Danny and Sandy recount their brief romance to their groups, Sandy recalling a romantic summer and Danny implying a more physical experience. When Sandy finally says Danny&#x27;s name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion at a pep rally where Sandy meets Tom, a jock, and Kenickie unveils his new used car, Greased Lightnin&#x27;, which he plans on street racing after a restoration. Caught between his feelings and his bad-boy reputation, Danny snubs Sandy in front of his gang and she becomes upset.

At a Pink Ladies pajama party, Sandy falls ill from drinking, trying a cigarette, and having her ears pierced by Frenchy. Rizzo, after mocking Sandy&#x27;s wholesome and chaste personality, departs for sex with Kenickie in his car—they do not use a condom as Kenickie discovers that the one he bought in the seventh grade has broken. They are disturbed by Leo, leader of the rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha. After the slumber party comes to an end, Sandy realizes she still loves Danny after all.

The next day, Danny apologizes to Sandy for having brushed her off the previous night and, with Coach Calhoun&#x27;s help, becomes a runner and successfully wins her back from Tom. However, their friends crash their date, and Kenickie and Rizzo break up after an argument. After a disastrous beauty class leaves Frenchy with candy-pink hair, she drops out of beauty school and reluctantly returns to Rydell to complete her high-school education.

During the school dance, broadcast live on &quot;National Bandstand&quot; and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, Rizzo and Kenickie spite each other by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. In a chaotic hand jive contest, Danny and Sandy dance well, but just before the winners are announced, Sonny pulls Sandy away and Cha-Cha cuts in to win with Danny, as Sandy storms out.

Danny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater, but a more direct and pushy advance causes Sandy to flee in horror. Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, who tells Sonny, who inadvertently spreads the rumor to the apparent father Kenickie, though Rizzo denies it to him.

On race day, Kenickie is struck in the head by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel, winning the race after Leo spins out. Sandy, watching from afar and rejoicing for Danny&#x27;s victory, concludes she still loves him and enlists Frenchy&#x27;s help in changing her attitude and looks to impress him.

On the last day of school, Rizzo finds she is not pregnant and reunites with Kenickie. At a carnival, Danny and Sandy each find they have changed for each other: Danny has become a letterman, and Sandy a greaser girl. The two depart in the Greased Lightnin&#x27; car, which takes flight into the sky.

==Production==
Director Randal Kleiser took numerous liberties with the original source material, most notably moving the setting from an urban Chicago setting (based on William Howard Taft High School), as the original musical had been, to a more suburban locale, reflecting his own teenage years at Radnor High School in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Writer Warren Casey was said to have based the high school on Gorton High School in Yonkers, New York. He had little control over the musical aspects of the film; his choice of theme song, a composition by Charles Fox and Paul Williams, was overruled when Robert Stigwood and Allan Carr commissioned a song from Stigwood&#x27;s client Barry Gibb at the last minute.

===Casting===
John Travolta had previously worked with Stigwood on &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, recorded the top-10 hit &quot;Let Her In&quot; in 1976, and had previously appeared as Doody in a touring production of the stage version of &quot;Grease&quot;. As part of a three-picture deal with Stigwood, Travolta was given the lead role after Henry Winkler (then starring as Arthur &quot;Fonzie&quot; Fonzarelli on Paramount&#x27;s TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot;) turned down the role for fear of being typecast as a greaser. (Winkler would later regret the decision.) Director Randal Kleiser had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot;; Kleiser and Travolta developed a close platonic bond over the course of production, helping Travolta maintain focus as he grieved the death of Diana Hyland (his girlfriend at the time and his on-screen mother in &quot;Bubble&quot;). Before Newton-John was hired, Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Carrie Fisher, Ann-Margret, Deborah Raffin, Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role. Fisher, who had recently finished &quot;Star Wars&quot;, was ultimately rejected because neither Stigwood nor Carr knew if she could sing. Osmond almost took the role before she realized the extent to which the character transformed into a rebel and turned it down to star in &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot; instead. Carr eventually chose Newton-John after a chance encounter at a soireé hosted by Helen Reddy. Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965&#x27;s &quot;Funny Things Happen Down Under&quot; and the little-seen 1970 film &quot;Toomorrow&quot;, which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time; she requested a screen test prior to accepting the role. Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing and the ability to rewrite the script, which included changing her character&#x27;s origin to an Australian immigrant (to avoid having to emulate an American accent) and making her less passive. In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John&#x27;s own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after &quot;Grease&quot;, the provocatively titled &quot;Totally Hot&quot;, featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair.

Lucie Arnaz auditioned for the part of Rizzo, but a talent client of Carr, Stockard Channing, was cast, several years after her last major film role and debut in &quot;The Fortune&quot;. At 33 she was the oldest cast member to play a high school student, and Kleiser made her and the other actors playing students take a &quot;crow’s feet test&quot; to see whether they could pass for younger in close-ups. Softer focus was used on some of the older actors&#x27; faces. Channing lobbied heavily to keep the climactic song &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot; in the score over Carr&#x27;s objections.

Elvis Presley was considered for the role of The Teen Angel but died before production. Marie Osmond&#x27;s brother and duet partner Donny Osmond was another potential Teen Angel before Avalon was cast, as was Frankie Valli, who had been given the choice of either singing the theme or appearing as the Teen Angel (he chose the former, believing the theme to be a better song and more likely hit). Fabian was noted as the inspiration for the role in the musical&#x27;s script notes, but he and Allan Carr had fallen out after Carr&#x27;s brief attempt at managing Fabian&#x27;s stage act in 1974, as Carr determined Fabian&#x27;s talent was limited to headlining a lounge act. The role would revive Avalon&#x27;s career on the nostalgia circuit, with Valli noting that both Frankies both benefited from their appearances despite &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; not being released as a single.

Jeff Conaway, like Travolta, had previously appeared in the stage version of &quot;Grease&quot;; he had played Danny Zuko during the show&#x27;s run on Broadway. He did not get to perform Kenickie&#x27;s featured number &quot;Greased Lightnin&#x27;&quot; due to Travolta&#x27;s influence and desire to have that song for himself. Jamie Donnelly reprised her role as Jan from the Broadway show, the only cast member to do so; as her hair had begun to gray by this point, she had to dye her hair to resemble her stage character. Kelly Ward had previously appeared as a similar sarcastic supporting character in &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; with Travolta under Kleiser; he was cast as Putzie, a mostly new character.

Lorenzo Lamas was a last-minute replacement for Steven Ford, who developed stage fright shortly before filming and backed out, and Mark Fidrych, who ran into conflicts with his full-time career as a baseball player. His role contained no spoken dialogue and required Lamas to bleach his hair to avoid looking like one of the T-Birds.

Adult film star Harry Reems was originally signed to play Coach Calhoun; however, executives at Paramount nixed the idea, concerned that his reputation as a porn star would hinder box office returns in the Southern United States, and producers cast Sid Caesar instead. Caesar was one of several veterans of 1950s television (Eve Arden, Frankie Avalon, Joan Blondell, Edd Byrnes, Alice Ghostley, Dody Goodman) to be cast in supporting roles; Paul Lynde was considered for the role Arden ultimately filled, with a scene conceived for Lynde that would have had him in a Carmen Miranda outfit. Coincidentally, Frankie Avalon and Randal Kleiser had both appeared in 1966&#x27;s &quot;Fireball 500&quot;, the latter as an extra.

===Filming locations===
The opening beach scene was shot at Malibu&#x27;s Leo Carrillo State Beach, making explicit reference to &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. The exterior Rydell scenes, including the front parking lot scenes, the auto shop, the “Summer Nights” bleachers number, Rizzo&#x27;s “There Are Worse Things I Can Do” number, the basketball, baseball, and track segments, and the interior of the gymnastics gym, were shot at Venice High School in Venice, California, during the summer of 1977. The Rydell interiors, including the high school dance, were filmed at Huntington Park High School. The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood. The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; and &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot;. The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place). The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, where many other films have been shot. The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School in Los Feliz. Furthermore, owing to budget cuts, a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles.

===Post-production===
Scenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca-Cola signs. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, producer Allan Carr had made a product placement deal with Coca-Cola&#x27;s main competitor Pepsi (for example, a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence animated by John David Wilson at Fine Arts Films). When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The &#x27;blurring&#x27; covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged. According to Kleiser, &quot;We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn&#x27;t complain. They didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Due to an editing error, a closing scene in which Danny and Sandy kiss was removed from the finished print and lost before its theatrical release. The scene was preserved only in black-and-white; Kleiser attempted to have the existing footage colorized and restored to the film for the film&#x27;s re-release in 1998 but was dissatisfied with the results. The scene is included as an extra on the 40th anniversary home video release, and Kleiser hopes to make another attempt at colorizing the footage that is effective enough for the footage to be inserted into the film as he originally intended by the time the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary comes in 2028.

==Release==
&quot;Grease&quot; was originally released in the United States on June 16, 1978, and was an immediate box-office success. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at number 2 (behind &quot;Jaws 2&quot;) at the box office for the weekend and with the all-time opening weekend records. Despite losing the opening weekend, it topped the box office the following weekend with a gross of $7,867,000 and set a record gross in its first 19 days, with $40,272,000. After 66 days, it had grossed $100 million to become Paramount&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film, behind &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and ended its initial run with a gross of $132,472,560, which made it the highest-grossing film in 1978.

In the United States and globally, it became the highest-grossing musical ever at the time, eclipsing the 13-year-old record held by &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; with a worldwide gross of $341 million.

In the United Kingdom, it opened with a record $2.2 million in its first eight days. It went on to become the highest-grossing film in the UK, with a gross of £14.7 million.

It was re-released May 18, 1979, in 1,248 theatres in the United States and Canada (except for the New York City area, where it opened a week later), Paramount&#x27;s biggest ever saturation release at the time, grossing $4.5 million in its opening weekend. The film played for four weeks and was then paired with the PG-rated version of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in late June. During the reissue, it overtook &quot;The Godfather&quot; as Paramount Pictures&#x27; highest-grossing film. It was re-released in March 1998 for its 20th anniversary, where it grossed a further $28 million in the United States and Canada.

It remained the highest-grossing live-action musical until 2012 when it was overtaken by &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and it remained the US champion until 2017 when it was surpassed by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and again in 2024 with &quot;Wicked&quot;, the first installment of that musical&#x27;s two-part adaptation. Discounting inflation, &quot;Grease&quot; is now the seventh-highest-grossing live-action musical worldwide.

A further re-issue for its 40th anniversary in 2018 grossed $1 million. To date, &quot;Grease&quot; has grossed $189,969,103 domestically and $206.2 million internationally, totaling $396 million worldwide. Another re-issue took place in select AMC Theatres locations in August 2022 to honor Olivia Newton-John following her death earlier that month, with $1 per sold ticket and the proceeds going to breast cancer research, through a donation by AMC Cares. Similarly, in the UK, selected Merlin Cinemas venues also reissued the film during August, but partnered with Macmillan Cancer Support, with a contribution of £1 per ticket sold.

==Reception==
&quot;Grease&quot; is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 66% approval rating based on 156 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Word is, &quot;Grease&quot; stars an electrifying John Travolta while serving up some &#x27;50s kitsch in a frenetic adaptation that isn&#x27;t always the one that we want.&quot;

First reviews were mixed. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Vincent Canby called the film &quot;terrific fun&quot;, describing it as a &quot;contemporary fantasy about a 1950s teen-age musical—a larger, funnier, wittier and more imaginative-than-Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own&quot;. Canby compared &quot;Grease&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; (1956) and &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963), calling it a &quot;multimillion-dollar evocation&quot; of these &quot;B-picture quickies&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;exciting only when John Travolta is on the screen&quot; but still recommending it to viewers, adding, &quot;Four of its musical numbers are genuine showstoppers that should bring applause.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the &quot;zesty choreography and very excellent new plus revived music&quot;, and thought Travolta and Newton-John &quot;play together quite well.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was negative, writing, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see &quot;Grease&quot; onstage, but on the testimony of this strident, cluttered, uninvolving and unattractive movie, it is the &#x27;50s—maybe the last innocent decade allowed to us—played back through a grotesquely distorting &#x27;70s consciousness.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also panned the film, writing, &quot;Despite the obvious attempts to recall bits from Stanley Donen musicals or Elvis Presley musicals or Frankie-and-Annette musicals, the spirit is closer to the New Tastelessness exemplified by Ken Russell, minus Russell&#x27;s slick visual style [...] I&#x27;ve never seen an uglier large-scale musical.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;Too often, &quot;Grease&quot; is simply mediocre, full of broad high-school humor, flat dramatic scenes and lethargic pacing. Fortunately, there&#x27;s nothing flat about John Travolta [...] when he&#x27;s on screen you can&#x27;t watch anyone else.&quot;

In a 1998 retrospective review, Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;an average musical, pleasant and upbeat and plastic.&quot; He found John Travolta&#x27;s Elvis Presley–inspired performance to be the highlight, but felt that &quot;Grease&quot; &quot;sees the material as silly camp.&quot; In 2018, Peter Bradshaw from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it 5 out of 5 stars, saying &quot;It&#x27;s still a sugar-rush of a film.&quot; &quot;Grease&quot; was voted the best musical ever on Channel 4&#x27;s 100 greatest musicals in 2004. The film was ranked number 21 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.

In recent years, the film has been reassessed for what some critics have deemed as discriminatory and problematic content. Bryn Gelbart from &quot;Business Insider&quot; wrote that the film had not aged well, describing it as preaching an &quot;unfortunate message&quot; with aspects that could be &quot;considered regressive by today&#x27;s standards&quot;. Kristen Baldwin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that the ending of the film was &quot;decidedly un-feminist&quot;. Katy Hall of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said that the film was &quot;deeply problematic&quot; but also &quot;ahead of its time.&quot; Joe Hildebrand of News.com.au defended the film, saying that it &quot;isn’t horribly sexist and offensive, it’s just that its characters say and do horrible, sexist and offensive things [...] In short, they’re a lot like, well, people.&quot; A 2020 showing of film on the BBC drew complaints from viewers and renewed criticism. Olivia Newton-John responded to the criticism, calling the comments &quot;silly&quot; and saying that the film isn&#x27;t meant &quot;to be taken so seriously.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Grease&quot; was released in the US on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1979, 1982, 1989, 1992 and 1994; the last VHS release was on June 23, 1998, and was titled the &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; following a theatrical re-release that March. This one was THX certified and consisted of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions.

On September 24, 2002, it was released on DVD for the first time. On September 19, 2006, it was re-released on DVD as the &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rydell Edition&quot;, which came with a black Rydell High T-Bird jacket cover, a white Rydell &quot;R&quot; letterman&#x27;s sweater cover, or the Target-exclusive Pink Ladies cover. It was released on Blu-ray Disc on May 5, 2009.

On March 12, 2013, &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Grease 2&quot; were packaged together in a double feature DVD set from Warner Home Video.

==Legacy==
===Sequel===
&quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982) stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer. While several of the Rydell High staff characters reprise their roles, the sequel focused on the latest class of graduating seniors, hence most of the principals from &quot;Grease&quot; did not appear. Patricia Birch, the original film&#x27;s choreographer, directed the sequel. The original musical&#x27;s cocreator Jim Jacobs, who was not involved in the making of &quot;Grease 2&quot;, has disowned the film.

===Sing-along version===
 On July 8, 2010, a sing-along version of &quot;Grease&quot; was released to selected theaters around the U.S. A trailer was released in May 2010, with cigarettes digitally removed from certain scenes, implying heavy editing; however, Paramount confirmed these changes were done only for the film&#x27;s advertising, and the rating for the film itself changed from its original PG to that of PG-13 (as that rating had not been introduced until 1984) for &quot;sexual content including references, teen smoking and drinking, and language.&quot; The film was shown for two weekends only; additional cities lobbied by fans from the Paramount official website started a week later and screened for one weekend. CBS aired this version of the film on June 7, 2020.

===Prequel===
In March 2019, it was announced that a prequel, called &quot;Summer Lovin&quot;&#x27;, was in development from Paramount Players. The project would be a joint-production collaboration with Temple Hill Productions and Picturestart. John August signed on to serve as screenwriter. As of August 2024, there has been no further word on the project.

==Soundtrack==
The ended 1978 as the second-best-selling album of the year in the United States, exceeded only by another soundtrack album, from the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which also starred Travolta. The song &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music – Original Song. The song &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; was released as a single prior to the film&#x27;s release and became an immediate chart-topper, despite not being in the stage show or having been seen in the film at that time. Additionally, the dance number to &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; was nominated for TV Land&#x27;s award for &quot;Movie Dance Sequence You Reenacted in Your Living Room&quot; in 2008. In the United Kingdom, the two Travolta/Newton-John duets, &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; and &quot;Summer Nights&quot;, were both number one hits and were still among the 30 best-selling singles of all time (at Nos. 5 and 28, respectively). The film&#x27;s title song was also a number-one hit single for Frankie Valli.

The song &quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m Sandra Dee&quot; refers to Sal Mineo in the original stage version. Mineo was stabbed to death a year before filming, so the line was changed to refer to Elvis Presley instead. The references to Troy Donahue, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Annette Funicello are from the original stage version. Coincidentally, this scene as well as the scene before and the scene after it were filmed on August 16, 1977, the date of Presley&#x27;s death.

Some of the songs were not present in the film; songs that appear in the film but not in the soundtrack are &quot;La Bamba&quot; by Ritchie Valens, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis, &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, &quot;Alma Mater Parody&quot;, and &quot;Rydell Fight Song&quot;. &quot;Alone at a Drive-in Movie (Instrumental)&quot;, &quot;Mooning&quot;, and &quot;Freddy My Love&quot; are not present in the film, although all three are listed in the end credits in addition to being on the soundtrack. (Both &quot;Mooning&quot; and &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Party Queen&quot;, the latter of which was played in the film as background music, were written in the musical for a character named Roger that was written out of the film, replaced by the non-singing Putzie. In general, all of the songs in the musical that were performed by characters other than Danny, Rizzo, Sandy, Johnny Casino, or the Teen Angel were either taken out of the film or given to other characters, including Marty Maraschino&#x27;s number &quot;Freddy My Love&quot;, Kenickie&#x27;s &quot;Greased Lightnin&#x27;&quot;, and Doody&#x27;s &quot;Those Magic Changes&quot;.) Two songs from the musical, &quot;Shakin&#x27; at the High School Hop&quot; and &quot;All Choked Up&quot;, were left off both the film and the soundtrack.

<text>Dr. Ahmad Yusuf Nuristani is a former politician from Afghanistan. He served as governor of Herat province from January 2009 to August 2010. In September 2018, President Ashraf Ghani appointed Nuristani to the Meshrano Jirga, the upper body of parliament in Afghanistan. From 2005 to 2008 he was the 1st Deputy Defense Minister, Government of Afghanistan. He was recently convicted in the United States and in Afghanistan.

==Early life and experiences==
Nuristani was born in 1947 in Neshagram, which is in the Want District of Nuristan Province in eastern Afghanistan. His father&#x27;s name is Ahmad Khan. 

From 1992 to 1996 Nuristani has worked as a Project Coordinator, Basic Education for Afghan Refugees, GTZ/UNHCR- sponsored project, in Peshawar, Pakistan. As a project coordinator, Nuristani managed programs aimed at serving educational needs of Afghan refugees in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He also provided guidance and coordination between GTZ and collaborating organizations (e.g. Ministry of Education, UNHCR, UNICEF, EU Commission for Afghan Refugees) in terms implementing formal and informal educational projects; forged relations with various religious and political organizations interested in working in the educational field of Afghan children who also promoted curriculums based on own ideologies and political thoughts; served as chairman of ACBAR educational committee, and in this capacity created curriculum standards that adequately served educational and cultural needs of children.

From 1988 to 1990 Nuristani worked as a Senior Cultural Specialist, United States Information Service (USIS)-Afghan Program, in Peshawar, Pakistan. In this position, Nuristani administered US international visitors exchange program (I.V.) by sending prospective political leaders to the US in order to acquire leadership and democratic skills; facilitated Fulbright, Hubert Humphrey, and North and South Fellowship and other fellowship and scholarship exchange programs; worked closely with Afghan resistance leaders and parties in Pakistan in order to promote good working relations and understanding between Afghan resistance parties and the US foreign mission in Pakistan; established the monthly 8-page journal, called Itlaat, in order to disseminate information on US foreign policies and other relevant issues in the region.

From 1975 to 1978, Nuristani worked as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant in the Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona in the United States. He also worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Social Sciences and Humanities at Kabul University in Afghanistan. He has been actively involved in Afghan politics for the last 30 years and has participated in major conferences related to Afghan issues. He was one of the founding members of the Writer&#x27;s Union of Free Afghanistan (WUFA) as well as the Afghan Professor&#x27;s University Association (APUA) during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan while residing in Peshawar. He received his Ph.D. in Near Eastern Studies from the University of Arizona located in Tucson, Arizona.

Nuristani was a central figure in the 2014 election crisis of Afghanistan, as the chairman of the election commission his deputies were accused of ballot stuffing in favor of president Ashraf Ghani. Nuristani has been a controversial figure in the election process of Afghanistan and, despite Afghan public opinion being against him, he insisted on staying as chairman of the election commission. On March 26, 2016, in a surprise move Nuristani resigned from his post as the chairman of election commission. He recently became a member of Afghanistan&#x27;s Meshrano Jirga (Parliament).

===Criminal conviction===

On December 11, 2019, Nuristani pleaded guilty in a United States federal court in Southern California to theft and fraud related charges. As a part of his plea agreement, Nuristani has agreed to make full restitution to the Social Security Administration and the California Department of Health Care Services. He faced up to 10 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He was sentenced to six months of home confinement. On March 8, 2021, a court in Afghanistan found Nuristani guilty of misusing his authority during his past employment for the Afghan government.

<text>Grote Reber (December 22, 1911 – December 20, 2002) was an American pioneer of radio astronomy, which combined his interests in amateur radio and amateur astronomy. He was instrumental in investigating and extending Karl Jansky&#x27;s pioneering work and conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies.

His 1937 radio antenna was the second ever to be used for astronomical purposes and the first parabolic reflecting antenna to be used as a radio telescope. For nearly a decade he was the world&#x27;s only radio astronomer.

==Life==
Reber was born and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and graduated from Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1933 with a degree in electrical engineering. He was an amateur radio operator (callsign W9GFZ), and worked for various radio manufacturers in Chicago from 1933 to 1947.

When he learned of Karl Jansky&#x27;s work in 1933, he decided this was the field he wanted to work in, and applied to Bell Labs, where Jansky was working.

===Early experimentation===
In the summer of 1937, Reber decided to build his own radio telescope in his back yard in Wheaton, IL. Reber&#x27;s radio telescope was considerably more advanced than Jansky&#x27;s, and consisted of a parabolic sheet metal dish 9 meters in diameter, focusing to a radio receiver 8 meters above the dish. The entire assembly was mounted on a tilting stand, allowing it to be pointed in various directions, though not turned. The telescope was completed in September 1937.

Reber&#x27;s first receiver operated at 3300 MHz and failed to detect signals from outer space, as did his second, operating at 900 MHz. Finally, his third attempt, at 160 MHz, was successful in 1938, confirming Jansky&#x27;s discovery. In 1940, he achieved his first professional publication, in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, but Reber refused a research appointment with Yerkes Observatory. He turned his attention to making a radiofrequency sky map, which he completed in 1941 and extended in 1943. He published a considerable body of work during this era, and was the initiator of the &quot;explosion&quot; of radio astronomy in the immediate post-Second World War era. His data, published as contour maps showing the brightness of the sky in radio wavelengths, revealed the existence of radio sources such as Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A for the first time. For nearly a decade from 1937 on he was the world&#x27;s only radio astronomer, a field that only expanded after World War Two when scientists, who had gained a great deal of knowledge during the wartime expansion of RADAR, entered the field, starting with Project Diana.

During this time he uncovered a mystery that was not explained until the 1950s. The standard theory of radio emissions from space was that they were due to black-body radiation, light (of which radio is a non-visible form) that is given off by all hot bodies. Using this theory one would expect that there would be considerably more high-energy light than low-energy, due to the presence of stars and other hot bodies. However Reber demonstrated that the reverse was true, and that there was a considerable amount of low-energy radio signal. It was not until the 1950s that synchrotron radiation was offered as an explanation for these measurements.

Reber sold his telescope to the National Bureau of Standards, and it was erected on a turntable at their field station in Sterling, Virginia. Eventually the telescope made its way to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and Reber supervised its reconstruction at that site. Reber also helped with a reconstruction of Jansky&#x27;s original telescope.

===Medium frequency research===
Starting in 1951, he received generous support from the Research Corporation in New York, and moved to Hawaii. In the 1950s, he wanted to return to active studies but much of the field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments. Instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored, that of medium frequency (hectometre) radio signals in the 0.5–3 MHz range, around the AM broadcast bands. However, signals with frequencies below 30 MHz are reflected by an ionized layer in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere called the ionosphere. In 1954, Reber moved to Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, where he worked with Bill Ellis at the University of Tasmania. There, on very cold, long, winter nights the ionosphere would, after many hours shielded from the Sun&#x27;s radiation by the bulk of the Earth, &#x27;quieten&#x27; and de-ionize, allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array. Reber described this as being a &quot;fortuitous situation&quot;. Tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise, which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space.

In the 1960s, he had an array of dipoles set up on the sheep grazing property of Dennistoun, about 7.5 km (5 miles) northeast of the town of Bothwell, Tasmania, where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of coach bolts at a local auction. He imported 4x8 douglas fir beams directly from a sawmill in Oregon, and then high technology double glazed window panes, also from the US. The bolts held the house together. The window panes formed a north facing passive solar wall, heating mat black painted, dimpled copper sheets, from which the warmed air rose by convection. The interior walls were lined with reflective rippled aluminium foil. The house was so well thermally insulated that the oven in the kitchen was nearly unusable because the heat from it, unable to escape, would raise the temperature of the room to over 50 °C (120 °F).

===Final years===
His house was never completely finished. It was meant to have a passive heat storage device, in the form of a thermally insulated pit full of dolerite rocks, underneath, but although his mind was sharp, his body started to fail him in his later years, and he was never able to move the rocks. He was fascinated by mirrors and had at least one in every room.
He had one of the amplifiers from the prime focus of his first telescope, probably the one used at 900 MHz. It was of compact point-to-point construction and used two R.C.A. type 955 &quot;acorn&quot; thermionic valves. All the rubber-insulated wires in it had perished and the rubber was hard and crumbly. He powered this amplifier, and all his later receivers at Dennistoun, from batteries, to avoid interference entering the equipment along power cables.


Reber was not a believer of the Big Bang theory; he believed that red shift was due to repeated absorption and re-emission or interaction of light and other electromagnetic radiations by low density dark matter, over intergalactic distances, and in 1977 he published an article called &quot;Endless, Boundless, Stable Universe&quot;, which outlined his theory. Reber was supportive of the Tired light explanation for the redshift-distance relationship.He was looked after in his final days at the Ouse District Hospital, about 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Hobart, Tasmania, where he died in 2002, two days before his 91st birthday. His ashes are located at Bothwell Cemetery, just past New Norfolk in Tasmania and at many major radio observatories around the world:

Kinyarwanda, Rwandan or Rwanda, officially known as Ikinyarwanda, is a Bantu language and the national language of Rwanda. It is a dialect of the Rwanda-Rundi language that is also spoken in adjacent parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, where the dialect is known as ikinyakore,Rufumbira,or &quot;Urufumbira&quot;. Kinyarwanda is universal among the native population of Rwanda and is mutually intelligible with Kirundi, the national language of neighbouring Burundi. Kinyabwishya and Kinyamulenge are mutually intelligible dialects spoken in the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces of neighbouring DR Congo.

In 2010, the Rwanda Academy of Language and Culture (RALC) was established to help promote and sustain Kinyarwanda. The organization attempted an orthographic reform in 2014, but it was met with pushback due to their perceived top-down and political nature, among other reasons.

==Geographic distribution==
Kinyarwanda is spoken in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. 

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The table below gives the consonants of Kinyarwanda.
# is only found in loanwords.
# Consonants in parentheses are allophones.

===Vowels===
The table below gives the vowel sounds of Kinyarwanda.
===Tone===
Kinyarwanda is a tonal language. Like many Bantu languages, it has a two-way contrast between high and low tones (low-tone syllables may be analyzed as toneless). The realization of tones in Kinyarwanda is influenced by a complex set of phonological rules.

==Orthography==

Except in a few morphological contexts, the sequences &#x27;ki&#x27; and &#x27;ke&#x27; may be pronounced interchangeably as and or and according to speaker&#x27;s preference.

The letters at the end of a word followed by a word starting with a vowel often follows a pattern of omission in common speech (sandhi), though the orthography remains the same. Consider the following excerpt of the Rwandan anthem: would be pronounced as 

There are some discrepancies in pronunciation from orthographic &quot;Cw&quot; and &quot;Cy.&quot; The glides strengthen to stops in consonant clusters. For example, (as in ) is normally pronounced . The differences are the following:

These are all sequences; , for example, is not labial-velar . Even when is pronounced rather than , the onset is a sequence, not a labialized .

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Kinyarwanda uses 16 of the Bantu noun classes. Sometimes these are grouped into 10 pairs so that most singular and plural forms of the same word are included in the same class. The table below shows the 16 noun classes and how they are paired in two commonly used systems.

===Verbs===
All Kinyarwanda verb infinitives begin with &quot;ku-&quot; (morphed into &quot;k(w)-&quot; before vowels, and into &quot;gu-&quot; before stems beginning with a voiceless consonant due to Dahl&#x27;s Law). To conjugate, the infinitive prefix is removed and replaced with a prefix agreeing with the subject. Then a tense marker can be inserted.

The class I prefixes &quot;y-/a-&quot; and &quot;ba-&quot; correspond to the third person for persons. The personal prefix &quot;n-&quot; becomes &quot;m-&quot; before a labial sound (p, b, f, v), while personal prefix &quot;tu-&quot; becomes &quot;du-&quot; under Dahl&#x27;s Law.

Every regular verb has three stems: the imperfective (ending in the morpheme &quot;-a&quot;), the perfective (ending in the morpheme &quot;-:ye&quot;, which may trigger a variety of morphophonological changes in the preceding segment) and the subjunctive (ending in the morpheme &quot;-e&quot;).

According to Botne (1983), a verb may belong to any of eight Aktionsart categories, which may be broadly grouped into stative and dynamic categories. In the immediate tense, dynamic verbs take the imperfective stem while stative verbs take the perfective stem, while both use the imperfective stem in the habitual or gnomic tense.

Simple tense/mood markers include the following:
* With the &quot;present stem&quot;:
** Present (&#x27;I do&#x27;): &quot;-&quot; (no infix)
** Present Progressive (&#x27;I am doing&#x27;): &quot;-ra-&quot; (assimilates to &quot;-da-&quot; when preceded by &quot;n&quot;)
** Habitual Past (&#x27;I used to do/was doing&#x27;): &quot;-a-&quot; plus &quot;-ga&quot; suffixed to the verb
** Future (&#x27;I will do&#x27;): &quot;-za- &quot;
* With the &quot;past stem&quot;:
** Polite Imperative (&#x27;Let me do&#x27;; &#x27;please do&#x27;): &quot;-&quot; (no infix)
** Perfect (&#x27;I have done/I did&#x27;): &quot;-a-&quot;
** Near Past (&#x27;I just did&#x27;): &quot;-ra-&quot; (assimilates to &quot;-da-&quot; when preceded by &quot;n&quot;)
** Preterite (&#x27;I did&#x27;): &quot;-ara-&quot;
** Subjunctive (&#x27;that I do/did&#x27;): &quot;-za- &quot;

Object affixes corresponding to the noun classes of an object may be placed after the tense marker and before the verb stem:

The personal object affixes are as follows:

===Causatives===

Kinyarwanda employs the use of periphrastic causatives, in addition to morphological causatives.

The periphrastic causatives use the verbs &quot;-teer-&quot; and &quot;-tum-&quot;, which mean &quot;cause&quot;. With &quot;-teer-&quot;, the original subject becomes the object of the main clause, leaving the original verb in the infinitive (just like in English):

In this construction, the original S can be deleted.

With &quot;-túm-&quot;, the original S remains in the embedded clause and the original verb is still marked for person and tense:

Derivational causatives use the instrumental marker &quot;-iish-&quot;. The construction is the same, but it is instrumental when the subject is inanimate and it is causative when the subject is animate:

This morpheme can be applied to intransitives (3) or transitives (4):



However, there can only be one animate direct object. If a sentence has two, one or both is deleted and understood from context.

The suffix &quot;-iish-&quot; implies an indirect causation (similar to English &quot;have&quot; in &quot;I had him write a paper), while other causatives imply a direct causation (similar to English &quot;make&quot; in &quot;I made him write a paper&quot;).

One of these more direct causation devices is the deletion of what is called a &quot;neutral&quot; morpheme &quot;-ik-&quot;, which indicates state or potentiality. Stems with the &quot;-ik-&quot; removed can take &quot;-iish&quot;, but the causation is less direct:

Another direct causation maker is &quot;-y-&quot; which is used for some verbs:

<text>Filariasis is a filarial infection caused by parasitic nematodes (roundworms) spread by different vectors. They are included in the list of neglected tropical diseases. 

The most common type is lymphatic filariasis caused by three species of &quot;Filaria&quot; that are spread by mosquitoes. Other types of filariasis are onchocerciasis also known as &quot;river blindness&quot; caused by &quot;onchocerca volvulus&quot;; Loa loa filariasis (Loiasis) caused by &quot;Loa loa&quot;; Mansonelliasis caused by three species of &quot;Mansonella&quot;, and Dirofilariasis caused by two types of &quot;Dirofilaria&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
In the year 2000, 199 million infection cases of lymphatic filariasis were predicted with 3.1 million cases in America and around 107 million in South East Asia, making up to 52% of the global cases coming from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Myanmar combined. While the African nations that comprised around 21% of the cases showed a decrease in the trend over a period of 19 years from 2000 to 2018, studies still proved the global burden of infection to be concentrated in southeast Asia.

==Cause==
Eight known filarial worms have humans as a definitive host. These are divided into three groups according to the part of the body they affect:
* Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, &quot;Brugia malayi&quot;, and &quot;Brugia timori&quot;. These worms occupy the lymphatic system, including the lymph nodes; in chronic cases, these worms can lead to the syndrome of &quot;elephantiasis&quot;.
* Loiasis a subcutaneous filariasis is caused by &quot;Loa loa&quot; (the eye worm). &quot;Mansonella streptocerca&quot;, and &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot;. These worms occupy the layer just under the skin. &quot;O. volvulus&quot; causes river blindness.
* Serous cavity filariasis is caused by the worms &quot;Mansonella perstans&quot; and &quot;Mansonella ozzardi&quot;, which occupy the serous cavity of the abdomen. &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;, the dog heartworm, rarely infects humans.
These worms are transmitted by infected mosquitoes of the genera &quot;Aedes, Culex, Anopheles&quot; and &quot;Mansonia.&quot; Recent evidence suggests that climate change has an influence in the spread of the parasitic disease and its vectors. Lymphatic filariasis has been the leading cause of permanent disfigurement and continues to be the second most common cause of long-term disability in the world, even after several efforts of curbing the problem.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot; (Wb) belonging to the family Onchocercidae, accounts for more than 90% of filarial infections worldwide. It completes its life cycle across two hosts, human beings are the definitive host while the mosquito is the intermediate host. The most common mosquito vectors that aid in transmission are Anopheles in Africa, &quot;Culex&quot; in America, &quot;Aedes&quot; and &quot;Mansonia&quot; in Asia (Zulfiqar et al., 2023). Female worms are ovoviviparous and can produce thousands of juveniles known as microfilariae, in infected humans. These are ingested by mosquitoes when they bite. The ingested microfilaria mature and eventually migrate to the insect proboscis from where they get injected into the human skin. Here they travel through the dermis to the lymph organs and further mature into male and female worm forms for the next 6 to 12 months and finally reproduce to complete the cycle.

Individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either &quot;microfilaraemic&quot; or &quot;amicrofilaraemic&quot;, depending on whether microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood. Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most spectacular symptom of lymphatic filariasis is elephantiasis – edema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues—which was the first disease discovered to be transmitted by mosquito bites. Elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in the lymphatic system.

Cases of acute inflammatory filariasis manifest 5 to 7 day episodes of fever along with inflammation of lymph nodes. It is often accompanied by epididymitis and spermatic cord inflammation. Secondary bacterial infections are very common and are seen to be more severe in previously unexposed immigrants than in native residents. Chronic filarial disease develops gradually over the years. In most patients the lymphatic dilation does not present any physical symptoms. However, inflammatory responses to dying adult worms often lead to chronic lymphedema in the affected regions which then progresses to elephantiasis. &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; often causes hydrocele and scrotal elephantiasis. Moreover, disruption of lymphatic vessels or aberrant drainage of lymph fluid often leads to chyluria and chyloceles.

Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities, while the ears, mucous membranes, and amputation stumps are affected less frequently. However, different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body; &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot; can affect the legs, arms, vulva, breasts, and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation), while &quot;Brugia timori&quot; rarely affects the genitals. Those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually free from microfilariae (amicrofilaraemic), and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae, as well as the adult worms.

The subcutaneous worms present with rashes, urticarial papules, and arthritis, as well as hyper- and hypopigmentation macules. &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; manifests itself in the eyes, causing &quot;river blindness&quot; (onchocerciasis), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis, in addition to abdominal pain, because these worms are also deep-tissue dwellers.

==Diagnosis==
Filariasis is usually diagnosed by identifying microfilariae on Giemsa stained, thin and thick blood film smears, using the &quot;gold standard&quot; known as the finger prick test. The finger prick test draws blood from the capillaries of the finger tip; larger veins can be used for blood extraction, but strict windows of the time of day must be observed. Blood must be drawn at appropriate times, which reflect the feeding activities of the vector insects. Examples are &quot;W. bancrofti&quot;, whose vector is a mosquito; night is the preferred time for blood collection. &quot;Loa loa&#x27;s&quot; vector is the deer fly; daytime collection is preferred. This method of diagnosis is only relevant to microfilariae that use the blood as transport from the lungs to the skin. Some filarial worms, such as &quot;M. streptocerca&quot; and &quot;O. volvulus&quot;, produce microfilariae that do not use the blood; they reside in the skin only. For these worms, diagnosis relies upon skin snips and can be carried out at any time.

In past, one of the first successes in the efforts to improve sensitivity and specificity of filarial diagnostic tests was identification of the repeated sequences in the parasite genome. The advancement in technologies like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) led to the development of various assays that made large scale surveys of parasitic prevalence much easier.

Filarial parasites are known to induce several immunoregulatory mechanisms like the 
activation of macrophages and T regulatory cells. It has been found that T regulatory cells play an essential role in how filarial worms modify the host immune response by producing immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). A very high plasma content of IgG4 has been recorded in asymptomatic patients of LF. Thus, the newer assays measuring IgG4 responses to crude filarial extracts or using fractions of parasite extracts have a better overall specificity but are not efficient in discriminating microfilaremic from amicrofilaremic serum donors. Assays which measure circulating antigen are expected to be better at measuring active infection because only living worms secrete circulating antigen.

As an attempt to come up with immunodiagnostic test kits for detection of circulating filarial antigen, numerous Antigens and Antibodies specific to the parasites have been tested. An Og4C3 monoclonal antibody-based ELISA and an immunochromatographic ( ICT) card test using the same monoclonal antibody have been tested. However, these commercial assays have certain issues with respect to stability, cost and specificity in field applications. Moreover, it was seen that the ICT format showed 25% of microfilarial negative individuals as being positive for circulating filarial antigens.

These commercial tests based on the above circulating antigens are also limited to 
successful detection of only adult bancroftian worms, making diagnosis only possible in later stages of infection when the therapeutics might no more show effect. A search for worm specific antigens was initiated where SXP-1 antigen was recognized to be specific for &quot;W.bancrofti&quot; filariasis. The antigen was identified after screening the cDNA library of adult worms with serum from both amicrofilaremic and microfilaremic patients.The native SXP-1 antigen was present in extracts of microfilariae and adult worms and were seen to be not specific to any lifecycle stage. 

To identify a W. bancrofti-specific antigen, pastor et al., used the Bm SXP gene to screen against the &quot;W.bancrofti&quot; Larval stage 3 cDNA library. This led to the identification of a cDNA sequence of &quot;W.bancrofti&quot; SXP-1 that encoded for a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 20.8 kDa. Wb-SXP was found to be 85 percent identical to the BmSXP polypeptide and differed along the C terminal where the former had an extra 29 amino acid long extension. The WbSXP-1 variant, where a stop codon has been introduced at the amino acid position 153 has been shown to be widely distributed among different &quot;W.bancrofti&quot; populations. Searches carried out with available sequences from various worms revealed the presence of SXP-1 homologs in many other nematodes with substantial identities in sequence observed during pairwise comparisons. Some examples include O.volvulus (50% identity; Ov-SXP-1), Ascaris suum (43%; As-SXP-1), Loa loa (46%; Li-SXP-1), and &quot;C.elegans&quot; (29%; Ce-SXP-1).The presence of a number of invariant and conserved residues in all of these nematode-derived molecules suggests that Wb-SXP-1 is a member of a new protein family.

==Treatment==
The recommended treatment for people outside the United States is albendazole combined with ivermectin. A combination of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole is also effective. Side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, and headaches. All of these treatments are microfilaricides; they have no effect on the adult worms. While the drugs are critical for treatment of the individual, proper hygiene is also required. One review study found that &quot;there is good evidence&quot; that albendazole itself does not contribute to the elimination of microfilaraemia or adult filarial worms, and thus is likely an unnecessary component of albendazole-ivermectin treatment. Diethylcarbamazine-medicated salt is effective in controlling lymphatic filariasis while maintaining its coverage at 90% in the community for six months.

Different trials were made to use the known drug at its maximum capacity in absence of new drugs. In a study from India, it was shown that a formulation of albendazole had better anti-filarial efficacy than albendazole itself.

In 2003, the common antibiotic doxycycline was suggested for treating elephantiasis. Filarial parasites have symbiotic bacteria in the genus &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, which live inside the worm and seem to play a major role in both its reproduction and the development of the disease. This drug has shown signs of inhibiting the reproduction of the bacteria, further inducing sterility in the nematode.
Clinical trials in June 2005 by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine reported an eight-week course almost eliminated microfilaraemia.
==Society and culture==

=== Research teams ===
In 2015 William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura were co-awarded half of that year&#x27;s Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the drug avermectin, which, in the further developed form ivermectin, has decreased the occurrence of lymphatic filariasis.

===Prospects for elimination===
Filarial diseases in humans offer prospects for elimination by means of vermicidal treatment. If the human link in the chain of infection can be broken, then notionally the disease could be wiped out in a season. In practice it is not so simple, and there are complications in that multiple species overlap in certain regions and double infections are common. This creates difficulties for routine mass treatment because people with onchocerciasis in particular react badly to treatment for lymphatic filariasis.

==Other animals==
Filariasis can also affect domesticated animals, such as cattle, sheep, and dogs.

===Cattle===
* Verminous hemorrhagic dermatitis is a clinical disease in cattle due to &quot;Parafilaria bovicola&quot;.
* Intradermal onchocerciasis of cattle results in losses in leather due to &quot;Onchocerca dermata&quot;, &quot;O. ochengi&quot;, and &quot;O. dukei&quot;. &quot;O. ochengi&quot; is closely related to human &quot;O. volvulus&quot; (river blindness), sharing the same vector, and could be useful in human medicine research.
* &quot;Stenofilaria assamensis&quot; and others cause different diseases in Asia, in cattle and zebu.

===Horses===
* &quot;Summer bleeding&quot; is hemorrhagic subcutaneous nodules in the head and upper forelimbs, caused by &quot;Parafilaria multipapillosa&quot; (North Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia and South America).

===Dogs===
* Heart filariasis is caused by &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;.

<doc id="336870" wikidata="Q418050" url="?curid=336870" title="Sertindole">
<text>Sertindole, sold under the brand name Serdolect among others, is an antipsychotic medication. Sertindole was developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and marketed under license by Abbott Labs. Like other atypical antipsychotics, it has activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. It is used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is classified chemically as a phenylindole derivative.

Sertindole is not approved for use in the United States and was discontinued in Australia in January 2014.

==Medical Uses==
Sertindole appears effective as an antipsychotic in schizophrenia. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, sertindole was found to be slightly less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, as effective as ziprasidone, approximately as effective as chlorpromazine and asenapine, and slightly more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone.

== Adverse effects ==

Very common (&gt;10% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Headache
* Ejaculation failure
* Insomnia
* Dizziness

Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Urine that tests positive for red and/or white blood cells
* Sedation (causes less sedation than most antipsychotic drugs according to a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs. Causes only slightly [and non-significantly] more sedation than amisulpride and paliperidone)
* Ejaculation disorder
* Erectile dysfunction
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Weight gain (which it seems to possess a similar propensity for causing as quetiapine)

Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include:

Rare (&lt;0.1% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
* Tardive dyskinesia

Unknown frequency adverse events include:
* Extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE; e.g. dystonia, akathisia, muscle rigidity, parkinsonism, etc. These adverse effects are probably uncommon/rare according to a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs which found it had the 2nd lowest effect size for causing EPSE)
* Venous thromboembolism
* QT interval prolongation (probably common; in a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was found to be the most prone to causing QT interval prolongation)

==Pharmacology==
Sertindole is metabolized in the body to dehydrosertindole.

==Safety and status==

===United States===
Abbott Labs first applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for sertindole in 1996, but withdrew this application in 1998 following concerns over the increased risk of sudden death from QTc prolongation. In a trial of 2000 patients on taking sertindole, 27 patients died unexpectedly, including 13 sudden deaths. Lundbeck cites the results of the Sertindole Cohort Prospective (SCoP) study of 10,000 patients to support its claim that although sertindole does increase the QTc interval, this is not associated with increased rates of cardiac arrhythmias, and that patients on sertindole had the same overall mortality rate as those on risperidone. Nevertheless, in April 2009 an FDA advisory panel voted 13-0 that sertindole was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia but 12-1 that it had not been shown to be acceptably safe. , the drug has not been approved by the FDA for use in the USA.

=== European Union ===
In the European Union, sertindole was approved and marketed in 19 countries from 1996, but its marketing authorization was suspended by the European Medicines Agency in 1998 and the drug was withdrawn from the market. In 2002, based on new data, the EMA&#x27;s CHMP suggested that Sertindole could be reintroduced for restricted use in clinical trials, with strong safeguards including extensive contraindications and warnings for patients at risk of cardiac dysrhythmias, a recommended reduction in maximum dose from 24 mg to 20 mg in all but exceptional cases, and extensive ECG monitoring requirement before and during treatment. , sertindole is authorized in several countries of the European Union.

<doc id="336877" wikidata="Q172940" url="?curid=336877" title="E-6 process">
<text>The E-6 process (often abbreviated to E-6) is a chromogenic photographic process for developing Ektachrome, Fujichrome and other color reversal (also called slide or transparency) photographic film.

Unlike some color reversal processes (such as Kodachrome K-14) that produce positive transparencies, E-6 processing can be performed by individual users with the same equipment that is used for processing black and white negative film or C-41 color negative film. The process is highly sensitive to temperature variations: a heated water bath is mandatory to stabilize the temperature at for the first developer and first wash to maintain process tolerances.

== History ==

The E-6 process superseded Kodak&#x27;s E-3 and E-4 processes. The E-3 process required fogging with light to accomplish image reversal and produced transparencies that faded quickly. The E-4 process used polluting chemicals, such as the highly toxic reversal agent borane tert-butylamine (TBAB).

Non-Kodak color reversal films introduced in the 1980s were compatible with the E-6 process, including variants of &quot;Fujichrome&quot; and &quot;Agfachrome&quot;, sold by Fujifilm and Agfa-Gevaert, respectively; one notable exception was Fujichrome 1600 Professional D, which was compatible with E-6 but used a customized PZ process for best results. The PZ process was similar to E-6, but used a different fog-suppressing chemical.
== Process variations ==
There are two versions of the E-6 process. Commercial laboratories use a six-bath chemical process. The &#x27;hobby&#x27; type chemistry kits, such as those produced by Tetenal, use three chemical baths that combine the color developer and fogging (reversal) bath solutions, and the pre-bleach, bleach and fixer bath solutions. Rinses, washes, stop baths and stabilizer/final rinse (the final step of the process) are not counted as baths when describing both the conventional six bath and hobbyist three bath processes.

=== Six-bath process ===

The structure of E-6 film has three separate light-sensitive layers; each layer is sensitive to a different group of wavelengths corresponding to red, green, and blue colors. When the film is exposed, each layer records a latent image based on its sensitivity. A yellow filter prevents blue light from exposing the green- and red-sensitive layers, which have some sensitivity to blue light.

Kodak Publication Z-119 provides instructions for various methods to carry out the E-6 process, including the use of continuous processors, roller-transport processors, rack-and-tank processors, batch processing, and rotary-tube processors; however, they largely share the same steps and recommendations for time and temperature with the exception of rotary-tube processors. The first developer, first wash, and reversal bath must be carried out in darkness.


=== Three-bath process ===
Tetenal nearly closed in 2019, but was rescued through a management buyout, and relaunched its online store in 2020, operating as Tetenal 1847 GmbH. However, the chemical production part of Tetenal 1847 was spun off as Norderstedter Chemiewerke in 2022, which filed for bankruptcy in February 2023 and the three-bath process is no longer available.

<doc id="336878" wikidata="Q1877202" url="?curid=336878" title="Bolivian gas conflict">
<text>The Bolivian Gas War (Spanish: &quot;Guerra del Gas&quot;) or Bolivian gas conflict was a social confrontation in Bolivia reaching its peak in 2003, centering on the exploitation of the country&#x27;s vast natural gas reserves. The expression can be extended to refer to the general conflict in Bolivia over the exploitation of gas resources, thus including the 2005 protests and the election of Evo Morales as president. Before these protests, Bolivia had seen a series of similar earlier protests during the Cochabamba protests of 2000, which were against the privatization of the municipal water supply.

The conflict had its roots in grievances over the government&#x27;s economic policies concerning natural gas, as well as coca eradication policies, corruption and violent military responses against strikes.

The &quot;Bolivian gas war&quot; thus came to a head in October 2003, leading to the resignation of President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (aka &quot;Goni&quot;). Strikes and road blocks mounted by indigenous and labour groups (including the COB trade union) brought the country to a standstill. Violent suppression by the Bolivian armed forces left some 60 people dead in October 2003, mostly inhabitants of El Alto, located on the &quot;Altiplano&quot; above the seat of government La Paz.

The governing coalition disintegrated forcing Goni to resign and leave the country on October 18, 2003. He was succeeded by the vice president, Carlos Mesa, who put the gas issue to a referendum on July 18, 2004. In May 2005, under duress from protesters, the Bolivian congress enacted a new hydrocarbons law, increasing the state&#x27;s royalties from natural gas exploitation. However, protesters, who included Evo Morales and Felipe Quispe, demanded full nationalization of hydrocarbon resources, and the increased participation of Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous majority, mainly composed of Aymaras and Quechuas, in the political life of the country. On June 6, 2005, Mesa was forced to resign as tens of thousands of protesters caused daily blockades to La Paz from the rest of the country. Morales&#x27; election at the end of 2005 was met with enthusiasm by the social movements, because he was, as the leader of left-wing MAS, one of the staunchest opponents to the exportation of the gas without corresponding industrialization in Bolivia. On May 1, 2006, President Morales signed a decree stating that all gas reserves were to be nationalized: &quot;the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control&quot; of hydrocarbons. The 2006 announcement was met by applause on La Paz&#x27;s main plaza, where Vice President Alvaro Garcia told the crowd that the government&#x27;s energy-related revenue would jump US$320 million to US$780 million in 2007, continuing a trend where revenues had expanded nearly sixfold between 2002 and 2006.

==Background==

===Gas reserves of Bolivia===
The central issue was Bolivia&#x27;s large natural gas reserves and the prospect for their future sale and use. The Bolivian gas reserves are the second largest in South America after Venezuela, and exploration after the privatization of the national oil company YPFB showed that proven natural gas reserves were 600% higher than previously known. The cash-poor, state-owned company could not afford the exploration costs. These reserves mainly are located in the southeastern Tarija Department, which contains 85% of gas and petrol reserves. According to the United States Department of Energy, another 10.6% is located within the department of Santa Cruz and 2.5% in the Cochabamba Department. After further exploration from 1996 to 2002, the estimated size of the probable gas reserves was calculated to be 12.5 times larger, passing from to . This number has declined somewhat to probable reserves. The proven reserves are . With the declining importance of tin mines, those reserves accounted for the majority of foreign investment in Bolivia.

The price which Bolivia is paid for its natural gas is roughly US to Brazil and $3.18 per million BTU to Argentina. Other sources state that Brazil pays between $3.15 and $3.60 per million BTU, not including $1.50 per million BTU in Petrobras extraction and transportation costs. As a comparison, the price of gas in the US as a whole in 2006 varied between US, although some years earlier the price of natural gas spiked at $14 per million BTU in California due to lack of pipeline capacity to and within California as well as due to electricity outages. While according to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Brazil and Argentina pay US$2 per thousand cubic meter of gas, which costs from $12 to $15 in California.

In 1994, a contract with Brazil was passed, two years before 1996&#x27;s privatization of the 70-year-old, state-owned &quot;Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia&quot; (YPFB). The construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline cost US$2.2 billion.

A consortium called Pacific LNG was formed to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies BG Group and BP, and Spain&#x27;s Repsol YPF. Repsol is one of three companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia, along with Petrobras and TotalEnergies. A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and liquefied before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (Baja California and California), through a Chilean port, for example Iquique. The 2003 Lozada deal was opposed heavily by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalism (Bolivia feels resentment after the territorial losses of the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, which deprived it of the Litoral province and hence access to the sea).

Government ministers hoped to use the gas profits to bolster the sagging Bolivian economy and claimed the money would be invested exclusively in health and education. Opponents argued that under the current law, the exportation of the gas as a raw material would give Bolivia only 18% of the future profits, or US$40 million to US$70 million per year. They further argued that exporting the gas so cheaply would be the latest case of foreign exploitation of Bolivia&#x27;s natural resources, starting with its silver and gold from the 17th century. They demanded that a plant be built in Bolivia to process the gas and that domestic consumption had to be met before export. As &quot;Le Monde&quot; puts it, &quot;two reasons plead for the industrial exploitation of the gas, which the multinational companies now have the capacities of doing. The first is related to the necessity of satisfying the Bolivians&#x27; energy needs. The second demonstrates the interest of exporting a more profitable product rather than selling raw material&quot;. According to the French newspaper, only La Paz, El Alto, Sucre, Potosí, Camiri and Santa Cruz are now connected to the gas network; making an interior network which would reach all Bolivians would cost $1.5 billion, notwithstanding a central gas pipeline to link the various regions together. According to Carlos Miranda, an independent expert quoted by &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the best industrialisation project is the petrochemical complex proposed by the Brazilian Braskem firm, which would create 40 000 direct or indirect jobs and cost $1.4 billion. This figure is equivalent to the amount so far invested by Repsol, TotalEnergies and Petrobras.

=== Santa Cruz autonomy movement ===
The eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando recently had been mobilizing in favor of autonomy. An important issue was opposition to the seizure of resources though nationalization. Community leaders are supported by the Comite Pro Santa Cruz, local co-ops, and by business organizations such as cattle ranchers and farmers. A strike against the new constitution was recently held which was observed in Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando. Tensions have been raised by the cultural and philosophical rift exposed by the push for a new constitution. As a basis for a new constitution, the western, Altiplano-based MAS party envisions a &quot;council of indigenous peoples&quot; along with a curtailment of private ownership, while Santa Cruz looks to western culture and capitalism.
Cultural divisions exist because people in eastern Bolivia, called &quot;Cambas&quot; (meaning &quot;friends&quot; in Guarani), are primarily of mestizo descent (mix of European and several native tribes the largest of which are the Guaraní), while the western Altiplano is dominated by a small white elite and a historically oppressed Quechua and Aymara majority.

The first signs of the modern autonomy movement occurred in 2005 when a march for autonomy was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. A result of this was the change in law to allow the election of departmental prefects. Another area of tension was the result of ongoing population shifts and the resulting demands for proportionally greater representation in Bolivia&#x27;s Congress to reflect these shifts by Santa Cruz. A compromise was reached to allow Santa Cruz to receive some of the seats warranted by population growth, and for the highlands to keep seats despite population losses.

Left-wing intellectuals Walter Chávez and Álvaro García Linera (former Bolivian Vice President and MAS party member) published an article in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; asserting that autonomy has been historically a demand of the Santa Cruz region, &quot;contemporarily imbued with far-right, populist sentiments.&quot; They also qualified Santa Cruz autonomy as a &quot;bourgeois ideology&quot; of the &quot;free market, foreign investment, racism, etc.&quot;, which pits the &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;whiter&quot; Santa Cruz elite against the short, dark-skinned and anti-capitalist Aymara and Quechua peoples of the western region of Bolivia.

===Dispute over pipeline route===
The dispute arose in early 2002, when the administration of President Jorge Quiroga proposed building the pipeline through neighboring Chile to the port of Mejillones, the most direct route to the Pacific Ocean. However, antagonism towards Chile runs deep in Bolivia because of the loss of Bolivia&#x27;s Pacific coastline to Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879–1884).

Bolivians began campaigning against the Chilean option, arguing instead that the pipeline should be routed north through the Peruvian port of Ilo, 260 km further from the gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialized in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones option would be $600 million cheaper.
Peru, however, claimed the difference in cost would be no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option say it would also benefit the economy of the northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass.

Supporters of the Chile pipeline argued that U.S. financiers would be unlikely to develop processing facilities within Bolivia.

Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, eager to promote territorial and economic integration, offered Bolivia a special economic zone for 99 years for exporting the gas at Ilo, the right of free passage, and the concession of a 10 km2 area, including a port, that would be exclusively under Bolivian administration.

President Jorge Quiroga postponed the decision shortly before leaving office in July 2002 and left this highly contentious issue to his successor. It was thought Quiroga did not want to jeopardize his chances of re-election as president in the 2007 elections.

After winning the 2002 presidential election Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada expressed his preference for the Mejillones option but made no &quot;official&quot; decision. The Gas War led to his resignation in October 2003.

===Escalation===
The social conflict escalated in September 2003 with protests and road blockages paralyzing large parts of the country, leading to increasingly violent confrontations with the Bolivian armed forces.
The insurrection was spearheaded by Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous majority, who accused Sánchez de Lozada of pandering to the US government&#x27;s &quot;war on drugs&quot; and blamed him for failing to improve living standards in Bolivia. On September 8, 650 Aymaras started a hunger strike to protest against the state detention of a villager. The man detained was one of the heads of the village, and was imprisoned for having sentenced to the death penalty two young men in a &quot;community justice&quot; trial.
On September 19, the National Coordination for the Defense of Gas mobilized 30,000 people in Cochabamba and 50,000 in La Paz to demonstrate against the pipeline.
The following day six Aymara villagers, including an eight-year-old girl, were killed in a confrontation in the town of Warisata. Government forces used planes and helicopters to circumvent the strikers and evacuate several hundred foreign and Bolivian tourists from Sorata who had been stranded by the road blockades for five days.

In response to the shootings, Bolivia&#x27;s Labor Union (COB) called a general strike on September 29 that paralyzed the country with road closures.
Union leaders insisted they would continue until the government backed down on its decision.
Poorly armed Aymara community militias drove the army and police out of Warisata and the towns of Sorata and Achacachi, equipped only with traditional Aymara sling shots and guns from the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution.
Eugenio Rojas, leader of the regional strike committee, declared that if the government refused to negotiate in Warisata, then the insurgent Aymara communities would surround La Paz and cut it off from the rest of the country — a tactic employed in the Túpaj Katari uprising of 1781.
Felipe Quispe, leader of the Indigenous Pachakuti Movement (MIP), stated that he would not participate in dialogue with the government until the military withdrew from blockaded areas. The government refused to negotiate with Quispe, claiming that he did not have the authority to represent the &quot;campesino&quot; movement.

As the protests continued, protesters in El Alto, a sprawling indigenous city of 750,000 people on the periphery of La Paz, proceeded to block key access routes to the capital causing severe fuel and food shortages. They also demanded the resignation of Sánchez de Lozada and his ministers, Yerko Kukoc, Minister of Government, and Carlos Sánchez de Berzaín, Minister of Defense, who were held responsible for the Warisata massacre. Protesters also voiced their opposition to the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement that was at the time under negotiation by the US and Latin American countries (since the November 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas, it has been put on stand-by).

==Martial law in El Alto==
On October 12, 2003, the government imposed martial law in El Alto after sixteen people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade.

On October 13, the administration of Sánchez de Lozada suspended the gas project &quot;until consultations have been conducted [with the Bolivian people].&quot; However, Vice President Carlos Mesa deplored what he referred to as the &quot;excessive force&quot; used in El Alto (80 dead) and withdrew his support for Sánchez de Lozada. The Minister of Economic Development, Jorge Torrez, of the MIR party, also resigned.

The United States Department of State issued a statement on October 13 declaring its support for Sánchez de Lozada, calling for &quot;Bolivia&#x27;s political leaders [to] publicly express their support for democratic and constitutional order. The international community and the United States will not tolerate any interruption of constitutional order and will not support any regime that results from undemocratic means&quot;.

On October 18, Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s governing coalition was fatally weakened when the &quot;New Republic Force&quot; party withdrew its support. He was forced to resign and was replaced by his vice president, Carlos Mesa, a former journalist. The strikes and roadblocks were lifted. Mesa promised that no civilians would be killed by police or army forces during his presidency. Despite dramatic unrest during his time in office, he respected this promise.

Among his first actions as president, Mesa promised a referendum on the gas issue and appointed several indigenous people to cabinet posts. On July 18, 2004, Mesa put the issue of gas nationalization to a referendum. On May 6, 2005, the Bolivian Congress passed a new law raising taxes from 18% to 32% on profits made by foreign companies on the extraction of oil and gas. Mesa failed to either sign or veto the law, so by law Senate President Hormando Vaca Diez was required to sign it into law on May 17. Many protesters felt this law was inadequate and demanded full nationalization of the gas and oil industry.

== The 2005 Hydrocarbons Law ==
On May 6, 2005, the long-awaited Hydrocarbons Law was finally approved by the Bolivian Congress. On May 17 Mesa again refused to either sign or veto the controversial law, thus constitutionally requiring Senate President Hormando Vaca Díez to sign the measure and put it into effect.

The new law returned legal ownership to the state of all hydrocarbons and natural resources, maintained royalties at 18 percent, but increased taxes from 16 to 32 percent. It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land containing gas deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. Protesters argued that the new law did not go far enough to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete nationalization of the gas and process in Bolivia.

Due to the uncertainty over renegotiation of contracts, foreign firms have practically stopped investing in the gas sector. Foreign investment virtually came to a standstill in the second half of 2005. Shortages in supply – very similar to those observed in Argentina after the 2001 price-fixing – are deepening in diesel, LPG, and begin to be apparent in natural gas. The May–June social unrest affected the supply of hydrocarbons products to the internal market, principally LPG and natural gas to the occidental region. Brazil implemented a contingency plan – led by the Energy and Mines Minister – to mitigate any potential impact from gas export curtailment. Although the supply was never curtailed, the social unrest in Bolivia created a strong sensation that security of supply could not be guaranteed. Occasional social action has continued to affect the continuity of supply, especially valve-closing actions.

== Carlos Mesa&#x27;s June 2005 resignation ==

=== The protests ===
Over 80,000 people participated in the May 2005 protests. Tens of thousands of people each day walked from El Alto to the seat of government La Paz, where protesters effectively shut down the city, bringing transportation to a halt through strikes and blockades, and engaging in street battles with police. The protestors demanded the nationalisation of the gas industry and reforms to give more power to the indigenous majority, who were mainly Aymaras from the impoverished highlands. They were pushed back by the police with tear gas and rubber bullets, while many of the miners involved in the protests came armed with dynamite.

May 24, 2005
More than 10,000 Aymara peasant farmers from the twenty highland provinces came down from &quot;El Alto&quot;&#x27;s Ceja neighborhood into La Paz to protest.

On May 31, 2005, residents of El Alto and the Aymara peasant farmers returned to La Paz. More than 50,000 people covered an area of nearly 100 square kilometers. The next day, the first regiment of the National Police decided, by consensus, not to repress the protests and were internally reprimanded by the government.

On June 2, as the protests raged on, President Mesa announced two measures, designed to placate the indigenous protesters on the one hand and the Santa Cruz autonomy movement on the other: elections for a new constitutional assembly and a referendum on regional autonomy, both set for October 16. However, both sides rejected Mesa&#x27;s call: the Pro-Santa Cruz Civic Committee declared its own referendum on autonomy for August 12, while in El Alto protesters began to cut off gasoline to La Paz.

Approximately half a million people mobilized in the streets of La Paz, on June 6, and President Mesa subsequently offered his resignation. Riot police used tear gas as miners amongst the demonstrators traditionally set off dynamite in clashes near the presidential palace, while a strike brought traffic to a standstill. However, Congress failed to meet for several days owing to the &quot;insecurity&quot; of meeting as protests raged nearby. Many members of Congress found themselves unable to physically attend the sessions. Senate President Hormando Vaca Díez decided to move the sessions to Bolivia&#x27;s capital, Sucre, in an attempt to avoid the protesters. Radical farmers occupied oil wells owned by transnational companies, and blockaded border crossings. Mesa ordered the military to airlift food to La Paz, which remained totally blockaded.

Vaca Diez and House of Delegates president, Mario Cossío, were the two next in the line of succession to become president. However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the presidency, finally promoting Eduardo Rodríguez, Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until elections could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia&#x27;s past, major political upheavals were taken as a normal part of the political process.

Caretaker President Rodríguez proceeded to implement the Hydrocarbons Law. The new tax IDH has been levied from the companies that are paying &#x27;under reserve&#x27;. A number of upstream gas companies have invoked Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and entered the conciliation phase with the state of Bolivia. The treaties are a step towards a court hearing before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), dependent of the World Bank, which could force Bolivia to pay indemnities to the companies.

== Concerns of possible US intervention ==
A military training agreement with Asunción (Paraguay), giving immunity to US soldiers, caused some concern after media reports initially reported that a base housing 20,000 US soldiers was being built at Mariscal Estigarribia within 200 km of Argentina and Bolivia, and 300 km of Brazil, near an airport which could receive large planes (B-52, C-130 Hercules, etc.) which the Paraguayan Air Forces do not have. According to the &quot;Clarín&quot;, an Argentinian newspaper, the US military base is strategic because of its location near the &quot;Triple Frontera&quot; between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina; its proximity to the Guarani aquifer; and, at the same &quot;moment that Washington&#x27;s magnifying glass goes on the &quot;Altiplano&quot; and points toward Venezuelan Hugo Chávez — the regional demon according to Bush&#x27;s administration — as the instigator of the instability in the region&quot; (&quot;Clarín&quot;).

Later reports indicated that 400 US troops would be deployed in Paraguay over 18 months for training and humanitarian missions consisting of 13 detachments numbering less than 50 personnel each. The Paraguayan administration as well as Bush&#x27;s administration denied that the airport would be used as a US military base, or that there would be any other US base in Paraguay.

== Other countries ==
The social conflicts paralyzed Bolivia&#x27;s political life for a time. The unpopularity of the neoliberal Washington consensus, a set of economic strategies implemented by Gonzalo de Lozada&#x27;s administration, set the stage for the 2006 election of president Evo Morales.

In the meantime, Chile promptly started to build several coastal terminals to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas from Indonesia, Australia and other sources.

Other South American countries are contemplating other ways to secure gas supplies: one project aims at linking the Camisea gas reserves in Peru to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. Linking Pisco (south of Peru) to Tocopilla (north of Chile) with a 1200 km pipeline would cost $2 billion. However, experts doubt the Camisea reserves are enough for all the Southern Cone countries.

Another 8,000 km gas pipeline (Gran Gasoducto del Sur) has been proposed that would link Venezuela to Argentina via Brazil. Its cost is estimated between $8 and $12 billion.

While Argentina and Chile are large consumers of gas (50 percent and 25 percent respectively), other South American countries are a lot less dependent.

== Nationalization of natural gas industry ==
On May 1, 2006, president Evo Morales signed a decree stating that all gas reserves were to be nationalized: &quot;the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control&quot; of hydrocarbons. He thus fulfilled his electoral promises, declaring that &quot;We are not a government of mere promises: we follow through on what we propose and what the people demand&quot;. The announcement was timed to coincide with Labor Day on May 1. Ordering the military and engineers of YPFB, the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month &quot;transition period&quot; to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, president Morales stated that the nationalization would not take the form of expropriations or confiscations. Vice President Álvaro García Linera said in La Paz&#x27;s main plaza that the government&#x27;s energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million next year, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002. Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil&#x27;s Petrobras, one of Bolivia&#x27;s largest investors, which controls 14% of the country&#x27;s gas reserves. Brazil&#x27;s Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted by considering the move as &quot;unfriendly&quot; and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia. Petrobras, Spain&#x27;s Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc and France&#x27;s Total are the main gas companies present in the country. According to Reuters, &quot;Bolivia&#x27;s actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, a Morales ally, did in the world&#x27;s fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes — conditions that oil majors largely agreed to accept.&quot; YPFB would pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50 percent of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies at the country&#x27;s two largest gas fields would get just 18 percent.

Negotiations between the Bolivian government and the foreign companies intensified during the week leading up to the deadline of Saturday October 28, 2006. On Friday an agreement was reached with two of the companies (including Total) and by the deadline on Saturday the rest of the ten companies (including Petrobras and Repsol YPF) operating in Bolivia had also come to an agreement. Full details of the new contracts have not been released, but the objective of raising government share of revenues from the two major fields from 60 percent to 82 percent seems to have been achieved. Revenue share for the government from minor fields is set at 60 percent.

During the six month negotiation period talks with the Brazilian company Petrobras had proven especially difficult. Petrobras had refused raises or reduction to a mere service provider. As a result of stalled talks Bolivian energy minister Andres Soliz Rada resigned in October and was replaced by Carlos Villegas. &quot;We are
obligated to live with Brazil in a marriage without divorce, because we both need each other&quot;, said Evo Morales in the contract signing ceremony underlining the mutual dependency of Brazil on Bolivian gas and of Bolivia on Petrobras in gas production.

===Reaction===
On December 15, 2007, the regions of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni, and Pando declared autonomy from the central government. They also moved to achieve full independence from Bolivia&#x27;s new constitution.

== The Protesters ==

=== Miners ===
Miners from the Bolivian trade union &quot;Central Obrera Boliviana&quot; (COB) have also been very active in the recent protests. Recently they have been active against propositions to privatize pensions. They have been known for letting off very loud explosions of dynamite in the recent protests.

=== Coca farmers ===
Shortly after the law passed, Evo Morales, an Aymara Indigenous, &quot;cocalero&quot;, and leader of the opposition party Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), took a moderate position calling the new law &quot;middle ground&quot;. However, as the protests progressed, Morales has come out in favor of nationalization and new elections.

=== Protesters in Cochabamba ===
Oscar Olivera was a prominent leader in the 2001 protests in Cochabamba against the privatization of water in Bolivia and has also become a leading figure. Specifically the protesters in Cochabamba, Bolivia&#x27;s fourth largest city, have cut off the main roads in the city and are calling for a new Constituent Assembly as well as nationalization.

=== Indigenous and peasant groups in Santa Cruz ===
Indigenous people in the eastern lowland department of Santa Cruz have also become active in the recent disputes over nationalization of the gas and oil industry. They are composed of indigenous groups such as the Guaraní, Ayoreo, Chiquitano and the Guyarayos, as opposed to the highland Indigenous people (Aymara and Quechua). They have been active in recent land disputes and the main organization representing this faction is known as the &quot;Confederacion de pueblos indigenas de Bolivia&quot; (CIDOB). The CIDOB after initially offering support to MAS, the party of Bolivia&#x27;s new president, have come to believe that they were deceived by the Bolivian government. The MAS, which is based in the highlands, is no more willing to grant them voice than the previous governments whose power was also based from the highlands. Another smaller more radical group called the &quot;Landless Peasant Movement&quot; (MST) which is somewhat similar to the Landless Workers&#x27; Movement in Brazil, and is composed mainly of immigrants from the western part of the country. Recently, Guaraní people from this group have taken oil fields run by Spain&#x27;s Repsol YPF and the United Kingdom&#x27;s BP and have forced them to stop production.

=== Felipe Quispe and peasant farmers ===
Felipe Quispe was an Aymara leader who wished to return control of the country from what he saw as the &quot;white elite&quot; to the indigenous people who make up the majority of the country&#x27;s population. Therefore, he was in favor of an independent &quot;Aymaran state&quot;. Quispe is the leader of the Pachakutik Indigenous Movement, that won six seats in the Congress and the secretary general of the United Peasants Union of Bolivia in the 2002 Bolivian elections.

<text>The ankle, the talocrural region or the jumping bone (informal) is the area where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, &quot;ankle&quot; (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint.

The main bones of the ankle region are the talus (in the foot), the tibia, and fibula (both in the leg). The talocrural joint is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than that between the smaller fibula and the talus.

==Structure==

===Region===
The ankle region is found at the junction of the leg and the foot. It extends downwards (distally) from the narrowest point of the lower leg and includes the parts of the foot closer to the body (proximal) to the heel and upper surface (dorsum) of the foot.

===Ankle joint===
The talocrural joint is the only mortise and tenon joint in the human body, the term likening the skeletal structure to the woodworking joint of the same name. The bony architecture of the ankle consists of three bones: the tibia, the fibula, and the talus. The articular surface of the tibia may be referred to as the &quot;plafond&quot; (French for &quot;ceiling&quot;). The medial malleolus is a bony process extending distally off the medial tibia. The distal-most aspect of the fibula is called the lateral malleolus. Together, the malleoli, along with their supporting ligaments, stabilize the talus underneath the tibia.

Because the motion of the subtalar joint provides a significant contribution to positioning the foot, some authors will describe it as the lower ankle joint, and call the talocrural joint the upper ankle joint. Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion are the movements that take place in the ankle joint. When the foot is plantar flexed, the ankle joint also allows some movements of side to side gliding, rotation, adduction, and abduction.

The bony arch formed by the tibial plafond and the two malleoli is referred to as the ankle &quot;mortise&quot; (or talar mortise). The mortise is a rectangular socket. The ankle is composed of three joints: the talocrural joint (also called talotibial joint, tibiotalar joint, talar mortise, talar joint), the subtalar joint (also called talocalcaneal), and the Inferior tibiofibular joint. The joint surface of all bones in the ankle is covered with articular cartilage.

The distances between the bones in the ankle are as follows:
*Talus - medial malleolus : 1.70 ± 0.13 mm
*Talus - tibial plafond: 2.04 ± 0.29 mm
*Talus - lateral malleolus: 2.13 ± 0.20 mm
Decreased distances indicate osteoarthritis.

===Ligaments===

The ankle joint is bound by the strong deltoid ligament and three lateral ligaments: the anterior talofibular ligament, the posterior talofibular ligament, and the calcaneofibular ligament.
* The &quot;deltoid ligament&quot; supports the medial side of the joint, and is attached at the medial malleolus of the tibia and connect in four places to the talar shelf of the calcaneus, calcaneonavicular ligament, the navicular tuberosity, and to the medial surface of the talus.
* The &quot;anterior&quot; and &quot;posterior talofibular ligaments&quot; support the lateral side of the joint from the lateral malleolus of the fibula to the dorsal and ventral ends of the talus.
* The &quot;calcaneofibular ligament&quot; is attached at the lateral malleolus and to the lateral surface of the calcaneus.

Though it does not span the ankle joint itself, the syndesmotic ligament makes an important contribution to the stability of the ankle. This ligament spans the syndesmosis, i.e. the articulation between the medial aspect of the distal fibula and the lateral aspect of the distal tibia. An isolated injury to this ligament is often called a high ankle sprain.

The bony architecture of the ankle joint is most stable in dorsiflexion. Thus, a sprained ankle is more likely to occur when the ankle is plantar-flexed, as ligamentous support is more important in this position. The classic ankle sprain involves the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), which is also the most commonly injured ligament during inversion sprains. Another ligament that can be injured in a severe ankle sprain is the calcaneofibular ligament.

===Retinacula, tendons and their synovial sheaths, vessels, and nerves===
A number of tendons pass through the ankle region. Bands of connective tissue called &quot;retinacula&quot; (singular: &quot;retinaculum&quot;) allow the tendons to exert force across the angle between the leg and foot without lifting away from the angle, a process called bowstringing.
The superior extensor retinaculum of foot extends between the anterior (forward) surfaces of the tibia and fibula near their lower (distal) ends. It contains the anterior tibial artery and vein and the tendons of the tibialis anterior muscle within its tendon sheath and the unsheathed tendons of extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. The deep peroneal nerve passes under the retinaculum while the superficial peroneal nerve is outside of it. The inferior extensor retinaculum of foot is a Y-shaped structure. Its lateral attachment is on the calcaneus, and the band travels towards the anterior tibia where it is attached and blends with the superior extensor retinaculum. Along with that course, the band divides and another segment attaches to the plantar aponeurosis. The tendons which pass through the superior extensor retinaculum are all sheathed along their paths through the inferior extensor retinaculum and the tendon of the fibularis tertius muscle is also contained within the retinaculum.

The flexor retinaculum of foot extends from the medial malleolus to the medical process of the calcaneus, and the following structures in order from medial to lateral: the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle, the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle, the posterior tibial artery and vein, the tibial nerve, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle.

The fibular retinacula hold the tendons of the fibularis longus and fibularis brevis along the lateral aspect of the ankle region. The superior fibular retinaculum extends from the deep transverse fascia of the leg and lateral malleolus to calcaneus. The inferior fibular retinaculum is a continuous extension from the inferior extensor retinaculum to the calcaneus.

===Mechanoreceptors===
Mechanoreceptors of the ankle send proprioceptive sensory input to the central nervous system (CNS). Muscle spindles are thought to be the main type of mechanoreceptor responsible for proprioceptive attributes from the ankle. The muscle spindle gives feedback to the CNS system on the current length of the muscle it innervates and to any change in length that occurs.

It was hypothesized that muscle spindle feedback from the ankle dorsiflexors played the most substantial role in proprioception relative to other muscular receptors that cross at the ankle joint. However, due to the multi-planar range of motion at the ankle joint there is not one group of muscles that is responsible for this. This helps to explain the relationship between the ankle and balance.

In 2011, a relationship between proprioception of the ankle and balance performance was seen in the CNS. This was done by using a fMRI machine in order to see the changes in brain activity when the receptors of the ankle are stimulated. This implicates the ankle directly with the ability to balance. Further research is needed in order to see to what extent does the ankle affect balance.

==Function==
Historically, the role of the ankle in locomotion has been discussed by Aristotle and Leonardo da Vinci. There is no question that ankle push-off is a significant force in human gait, but how much energy is used in leg swing as opposed to advancing the whole-body center of mass is not clear.

==Clinical significance==
===Traumatic injury===
Of all major joints, the ankle is the most commonly injured. If the outside surface of the foot is twisted under the leg during weight bearing, the lateral ligament, especially the anterior talofibular portion, is subject to tearing (a sprain) as it is weaker than the medial ligament and it resists inward rotation of the talocrural joint.

====Fractures====
===Imaging===
The initial evaluation of suspected ankle pathology is usually by projectional radiography (&quot;X-ray&quot;).
Varus or valgus deformity, if suspected, can be measured with the frontal tibiotalar surface angle (TTS), formed by the mid-longitudinal tibial axis (such as through a line bisecting the tibia at 8 and 13 cm above the tibial plafond) and the talar surface. An angle of less than 84 degrees is regarded as &quot;talipes varus&quot;, and an angle of more than 94 degrees is regarded as &quot;talipes valgus&quot;.

For ligamentous injury, there are three main landmarks on X-rays: The first is the &quot;tibiofibular clear space&quot;, the horizontal distance from the lateral border of the posterior tibial malleolus to the medial border of the fibula, with greater than 5 mm being abnormal. The second is &quot;tibiofibular overlap&quot;, the horizontal distance between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the anterior tibial prominence, with less than 10 mm being abnormal. The final measurement is the &quot;medial clear space&quot;, the distance between the lateral aspect of the medial malleolus and the medial border of the talus at the level of the talar dome, with a measurement greater than 4 mm being abnormal. Loss of any of these normal anatomic spaces can indirectly reflect ligamentous injury or occult fracture, and can be followed by MRI or CT.

===Abnormalities===
Clubfoot or talipes equinovarus, which occurs in one to two of every 1,000 live births, involves multiple abnormalities of the foot. Equinus refers to the downard deflection of the ankle, and is named for the walking on the toes in the manner of a horse. This does not occur because it is accompanied by an inward rotation of the foot (varus deformity), which untreated, results in walking on the sides of the feet. Treatment may involve manipulation and casting or surgery.

Ankle joint equinus, normally in adults, relates to restricted ankle joint range of motion(ROM). Calf muscle stretching exercises are normally helpful to increase the ankle joint dorsiflexion and used to manage clinical symptoms resulting from ankle equinus.

Occasionally a human ankle has a ball-and-socket ankle joint and fusion of the talo-navicular joint.

==History==
The word ankle or ancle is common, in various forms, to Germanic languages, probably connected in origin with the Latin , or Greek , meaning bent.

==Other animals==
===Evolution===
It has been suggested that dexterous control of toes has been lost in favour of a more precise voluntary control of the ankle joint.

<text>The Great Goddess of Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacan Spider Woman) is a proposed goddess of the pre-Columbian Teotihuacan civilization ( 100 BCE - 700 CE), in what is now Mexico.

==Discovery and interpretation==
In years leading up to 1942, a series of murals were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. The Tepantitla compound provided housing for what appears to have been high status citizens and its walls (as well as much of Teotihuacan) are adorned with brightly painted frescoes. The largest figures within the murals depicted complex and ornate deities or supernaturals. In 1942, archaeologist Alfonso Caso identified these central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of Tlaloc, the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare. This was the consensus view for some 30 years.

In 1974, Peter Furst suggested that the murals instead showed a &quot;feminine&quot; deity, an interpretation echoed by researcher Esther Pasztory. Their analysis of the murals was based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure. Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal. In 1983, Karl Taube termed this goddess the &quot;Teotihuacan Spider Woman&quot;. The more neutral description of this deity as the &quot;Great Goddess&quot; has since gained currency.

The Great Goddess has since been identified at Teotihuacan locations other than Tepantitla – including the Tetitla compound (see photo below), the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture – as well as on portable art including vessels and even on the back of a pyrite mirror. The 3-metre-high blocky statue (see photo below) which formerly sat near the base of the Pyramid of Moon is thought to represent the Great Goddess, despite the absence of the bird-headdress or the fanged nosepiece.

Esther Pasztory speculates that the Great Goddess, as a distant and ambivalent mother figure, was able to provide a uniting structure for Teotihuacan that transcended divisions within the city.
===After Teotihuacan===
The Great Goddess is apparently peculiar to Teotihuacan, and does not appear outside the city except where Teotihuacanos settled. There is very little trace of the Great Goddess in the Valley of Mexico&#x27;s later Toltec culture, although an earth goddess image has been identified on Stela 1, from Xochicalco, a Toltec contemporary. While the Aztec goddess Chalchiuhtlicue has been identified as a successor to the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan, archaeologist Janet Catherine Berlo has suggested that at least the Goddess&#x27; warlike aspect was assumed by the Aztec&#x27;s protector god – and war god – Huītzilōpōchtli. The wresting of this aspect from the Great Goddess was memorialized in the myth Huitzilopochtli, who slew his sister Coyolxauhqui shortly after his birth.

Berlo also sees echoes of the Great Goddess in the veneration of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

==The Great Goddess==
Defining characteristics of the Great Goddess are a bird headress and a nose pendant with descending fangs. In the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, for example, the Great Goddess wears a frame headdress that includes the face of a green bird, generally identified as an owl or quetzal, and a rectangular nosepiece adorned with three circles below which hang three or five fangs. The outer fangs curl away from the center, while the middle fang points down. She is also always seen with jewelry such as beaded necklaces and earrings which were commonly worn by Teotihuacan women. Her face is always shown frontally, either masked or partially covered, and her hands in murals are always depicted stretched out giving water, seeds, and jade treasures.

Other defining characteristics include the colors red and yellow; note that the Goddess appears with a yellowish cast in both murals.

In the depiction from the Tepantitla compound, the Great Goddess appears with vegetation growing out of her head, perhaps hallucinogenic morning glory vines or the world tree. Spiders and butterflies appear on the vegetation and water drips from its branches and flows from the hands of the Great Goddess. Water also flows from her lower body. These many representations of water led Caso to declare this to be a representation of the rain god, Tlaloc.

Below this depiction, separated from it by two interwoven serpents and a talud-tablero, is a scene showing dozens of small human figures, usually wearing only a loincloth and often showing a speech scroll (see photo below). Several of these figures are swimming in the criss-crossed rivers flowing from a mountain at the bottom of the scene. Caso interpreted this scene as the afterlife realm of Tlaloc, although this interpretation has also been challenged, most recently by María Teresa Uriarte, who provides a more commonplace interpretation: that &quot;this mural represents Teotihuacan as [the] prototypical civilized city associated with the beginning of time and the calendar&quot;. 
==Domain==
The Great Goddess is thought to have been a goddess of the underworld, darkness, the earth, water, war, and possibly even creation itself. To the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, the jaguar, the owl, and especially the spider were considered creatures of darkness, often found in caves and during the night. The fact that the Great Goddess is frequently depicted with all of these creatures further supports the idea of her underworld connections.

In many murals, the Great Goddess is shown with many of the scurrying arachnids in the background, on her clothing, or hanging from her arms. She is often seen with shields decorated with spider webs, further suggesting her relationship with warfare. 
The Great Goddess is often shown in paradisial settings, giving gifts. For example, the mural from Tepantitla shows water dripping from her hands while in the tableau under her portrait mortals swim, play ball, and dance (see photo to right). This seeming gentleness is in contrast to later similar Aztec deities such as Cihuacoatl, who frequently has a warlike aspect. This contrast, according to Esther Pasztory, an archaeologist who has long studied Teotihuacan, extends beyond the goddesses in question to the core of the Teotihuacan and Aztec cultures themselves: &quot;Although I cannot prove this precisely, I sense that the Aztec goal was military glory and staving off the collapse of the universe, whereas the Teotihuacan aim seems to have been the creation of paradise on earth.&quot;

This is not to say, however, that the Great Goddess does not have her more violent aspect: one mural fragment, likely from Techinantitla, shows her as a large mouth with teeth, framed by clawed hands.

==Other interpretations==

=== Mixed-Gender Interpretation ===

Elisa C. Mandell&#x27;s 2015 article &quot;A New Analysis of the Gender Attribution of the &#x27;Great Goddess&#x27; of Teotihuacan&quot; published by Cambridge challenges the interpretation of the Great Goddess as being not only female but also male, a mixed-gender figure. Sex is understood as the biological and anatomical difference between men and women, while gender is a socially and culturally constructed identity. There are disagreements among historians over the role of biology to informing gender and “whether sex as a biological concept exists outside Western society”. There is a history of mixed-gender identity within Mesoamerican people, and considering that the Goddess is from Teotihuacan, Western models of gender binary should not be imposed upon non-Western figures. Additionally, there are no explicit sexual characteristics shown on the Great Goddess so their sex cannot be deduced.

There is a history of masculine and feminine attributes being shown within the same figure in Mesoamerican art. The Maya Maize Deity can be seen as an example of this, as posited by Bassie-Sweet. Considering the importance of maize, or corn, which has the ability to switch between the two biological sexes. With the fact that Mesoamerican people considered themselves to be descendants of the corn plant, this nature based culture allows for ambiguity of sex and gender within the peoples. Furthermore, we have evidence that the Maize God inspired Maya elites, no matter their gender, to wear mixed-gender costumes to honor the Maize God.

Mandell&#x27;s article analyzes and reattributes each element included in the Goddesses depiction in the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, reconsidering previous gendering of these elements. Pasztory references the three main elements of the Goddess: the avian headdress, the yellow and red zig-zags, and the nosebar. Mandell references many depictions of male and female deities where these elements are including, suggesting that it is impossible to determine any specific gendering from the headdress, zig-zags, and nosebar. Mandell then suggests that the mixture of these male and female attributes suggests that the Goddess is mixed-gender.

More generally, many images have been understood as depicting the Goddess because of their inclusion of water, which is also understood as a feminine symbol. Mandell posits that there is nothing inherently feminine about this liquid. In the Tepantitla and Tetitla murals, the water is filled with seed and shell shaped object. Liquid with sea-life and sperm may represent semen made up of sperm, thus suggesting a masculine association. One of the reasons Pasztory had asserted that the Goddess was a feminine deity is because it was understood to be wearing a quechquemitl. The quechquemitl is often associated with female figures. However, the triangular shirt or cape had multiple meanings for different people that also changed over time, and therefore it cannot be used as a simple demarcation of a figure’s sex or gender. Similarly, the Goddess’ ear ornaments had been a factor in deciphering the deity as feminine. Mandell asserts that there is no conclusive evidence to support these ornaments as feminine, and rather this particular ear ornament has been seen on male and female gods. The short skirt seen worn by figures in the Tepantitla mural has been considered another attribute of femininity, yet in Teotihuacan it was more common for males to be depicted in short kilts. The profile figures in the Tepantitla mural carry small bags, which men are known to carry, as seen in depictions of priests in Maya art. Mandell asserts that the ambiguity and combination of masculine and feminine attributes should be seen as a mixed-gender performance, not subjected to the Western binary model of gender.

=== Various Interpretations within the Archaeological Community ===

* In a 2006 article in &quot;Ancient Mesoamerica&quot;, Zoltán Paulinyi argues that the Great Goddess or Spider Woman is &quot;highly speculative&quot; and is a result of fusing up to six unrelated gods and goddesses.
* In &quot;The Olmec Mountain and Tree Creation in Mesoamerican Cosmology&quot;, Linda Schele states that the primary mural represents &quot;either a Teotihuacan ruler or the Great Goddess&quot;.
* In her 2007 book, &quot;The Teotihuacan Trinity&quot;, Anna Headrick is cautious in identifying the murals as portraits of the Great Goddess, preferring the term &quot;mountain-tree&quot;. Headrick identifies the tree which sprouts from the headdress as the Mesoamerican world tree.

==Similar deities==
Some American Indians, such as the Pueblo and Navajo, revered what seems to be a similar deity. Referred to as the Spider Grandmother, she shares many traits with the Teotihuacan Spider Woman.

<text>Robert Eugene Ward (September 13, 1917 – April 3, 2013) was an American composer who is best remembered for his opera &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1961) after the 1953 play of the same name by Arthur Miller. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music for that opera in 1962. 

==Early work and education==
Ward was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one of five children of the owner of a moving and storage company. He sang in church choirs and local opera theaters when he was a boy. His earliest extant compositions date to 1934, at a time he was attending John Adams High School, from which he graduated in 1935. After that, Ward attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where his composition teachers were Bernard Rogers, Howard Hanson and Edward Royce. Ward received a fellowship and attended the Juilliard School of Music in New York from 1939 to 1942, where he studied composition with Frederick Jacobi, orchestration with Bernard Wagenaar, and conducting with Albert Stoessel and Edgar Schenkman. In the summer of 1941 he studied under Aaron Copland at the Berkshire Music Center in Massachusetts.

From his student days to the end of World War II, Ward produced about forty compositions, of which eleven he later withdrew. Most of those early works are small scale, songs and pieces for piano or chamber ensembles. He completed his First Symphony in 1941, which won the Juilliard Publication Award the following year. Around that time, Ward also wrote a number of reviews and other articles for the magazine &quot;Modern Music&quot; and served on the faculty of Queens College.

In February 1942 Ward joined the U.S. Army, and attended the Army Music School at Fort Myer, being assigned the military occupational specialty of band director. At Fort Riley, Kansas, he wrote a major part of the score to a musical revue called &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;. Ward was assigned to the 7th Infantry and sent to the Pacific. For the 7th Infantry Band he wrote a March, and for its dance band he wrote at least two jazz compositions.

During his military service Ward met Mary Raymond Benedict, a Red Cross recreation worker. They married on June 19, 1944, and had five children; Melinda, Jonathon, Mark, Johanna and Tim.

==Major works==
Ward earned a Bronze Star for meritorious service in the Aleutian Islands. During his military service Ward managed to compose two serious orchestral compositions, &quot;Adagio and Allegro&quot;, first performed in New York in 1944, and &quot;Jubilation: An Overture&quot;, which was written mostly on Okinawa, Japan, in 1945, and was premiered at Carnegie Hall by the National Orchestral Association the following spring.

After being discharged from military service at the end of the war, Ward returned to Juilliard, earning postgraduate certificate in 1946 and immediately joining the faculty, teaching there until 1956. He served as an Associate in Music at Columbia University from 1946 to 1948.

Ward wrote his &quot;Second Symphony&quot;, dedicated to his wife, in 1947, while living in Nyack, New York. It was premiered by the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hans Kindler. This symphony was quite popular for a few years, in part thanks to Eugene Ormandy playing it with the Philadelphia Orchestra several times and even taking it on tour to Carnegie Hall in New York and Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.

Andrew Stiller, in his article on Ward for &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, describes Ward&#x27;s musical style as deriving &quot;largely from Hindemith, but also shows the considerable influence of Gershwin&quot;.

Ward conducted the Doctors Orchestral Society of New York from 1949 to 1955, wrote his &quot;Third Symphony&quot; and his &quot;First Sonata for Violin and Piano&quot; in 1950, the &quot;Sacred Songs for Pantheists&quot; in 1951, and was music director of the Third Street Music School Settlement from 1952 to 1955, and wrote the &quot;Euphony for Orchestra&quot; in 1954. He left Juilliard in 1956 to become Executive Vice-President of Galaxy Music Corporation and Managing Editor of High Gate Press in New York, positions he maintained until 1967. Ward wrote his &quot;Fourth Symphony&quot; in 1958, the &quot;Prairie Overture&quot; in 1957, the cantata &quot;Earth Shall Be Fair&quot; and the &quot;Divertimento&quot; in 1960.

Ward wrote his first opera to a libretto by Bernard Stambler, &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot;, and it was premiered in 1956. His next opera, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, based on Arthur Miller&#x27;s play, premiered in 1961, became Ward&#x27;s best known work. For it Ward received the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Music. It is frequently produced around the world.

After the success of &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Ward received several commissions for ceremonial works, such as &quot;Hymn and Celebration&quot; in 1962, &quot;Music for a Celebration&quot; in 1963, &quot;Festive Ode&quot; in 1966, &quot;Fiesta Processional&quot; in 1966, and &quot;Music for a Great Occasion&quot; in 1970. During those years he also wrote the cantata, &quot;Sweet Freedom&#x27;s Song&quot;, in 1965; the &quot;Fifth Symphony&quot; in 1976; a &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; in 1968, which was commissioned by the Powder River Foundation for the soloist Marjorie Mitchell; a &quot;Saxophone Concerto&quot; in 1984; and the operas &quot;The Lady from Colorado&quot; in 1964, &quot;Claudia Leqare&quot; in 1977, &quot;Abelard and Heloise&quot; in 1981, &quot;Minutes till Midnight&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Roman Fever&quot; in 1993 (based on the short story of the same name by Edith Wharton). He also wrote chamber music, such as the &quot;First String Quartet&quot; of 1966 and the &quot;Raleigh Divertimento&quot; of 1985.

His work has been championed by such conductors as Igor Buketoff, who recorded the 3rd and 6th symphonies.

==Later work==
In 1967, Ward became Chancellor of the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. He held this post until 1975, when he stepped down to serve as a member of the composition faculty for five more years. In 1978 he came to Duke University as a visiting professor, and there he remained as Mary Duke Biddle Professor of Music from 1979 to 1987. His students included Michael Penny and Michael Ching.

In the fall of 1987, he retired from Duke University as Professor Emeritus, and continued to live and compose in Durham, North Carolina. His most recent composition is &quot;In Praise of Science,&quot; which premiered at the ribbon-cutting ceremony of Syracuse University&#x27;s Life Science Complex by the Syracuse University Brass Ensemble on November 7, 2008.

After a period of failing health, Ward died in a Durham retirement home on April 3, 2013, at the age of 95.

==Selected works==
Ward&#x27;s music is largely published by Highgate Press, E.C. Schirmer, Associated Music Publishers, Peer International, Merrymount Music Press, C.F. Peters and Vireo Press.
