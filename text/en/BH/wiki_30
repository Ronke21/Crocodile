<text>Locomotive Basic is a proprietary dialect of the BASIC programming language written by Locomotive Software.

It was modified (many custom features to support the platform) for use on the Amstrad CPC as &quot;Amstrad BASIC&quot; (where it was built-in on ROM).

Later Locomotive BASIC-2 was produced for the IBM PC compatibles platform as a GEM application on the Amstrad PC1512 and 1640 and was a descendant of Mallard BASIC, the interpreter for CP/M supplied with the Amstrad PCW.

There are two versions of Amstrad; BASIC 1.0 which only came with the CPC464 (and had a buggy codice_1 function), and BASIC 1.1 which corrected this and shipped with all other CPCs. BASIC 1.1 was also included in the Amstrad CPC Plus series machines, as part of the included game cartridge.

== Development ==
Development was based on existing work recently undertaken writing Mallard BASIC for Acorn Computers Z80 addon for the BBC Micro. It is reported to have taken around 12 weeks to enhance the existing code, and was &quot;very influenced&quot; by BBC BASIC, though adding additional functions to do things that would have required assembly language on the BBC.

The &quot;ARNOLD&quot; platform (the CPC464 development codename) was designed to be solid enough to attract the &quot;serious&quot; users Amstrad wanted. Locomotive were engaged to produce the firmware and BASIC for the platform. The mix produced a comprehensive result with technical capabilities almost unheard of in any one contemporary platform - the tidy approach to firmware access with fixed jump blocks, the hypothecation of the firmware into modules, the clever hardware allowing expandability, with multiple pages of RAM and ROM all occupying the same address-space, simultaneously accessible, re-locatable display memory etc. many of which appeared only partially, or not at all on rival platforms.

== Features of the CPC platform ==

If a programmer is concerned only with writing in a rich BASIC dialect they have an excellent machine on which to ply their skills and there is no reliance or expectation the programmer will ultimately have to resort to machine code or study the function of the hardware to produce good quality software. However, to fully comprehend the ethos behind Amstrad BASIC and push the machine to its limits, it is necessary to understand, at least superficially, the design approach to the machine as a whole.

Fundamentally, the CPC platform consists of clever hardware with a rich firmware to exploit it; compartmentalised into sub-systems with standardised jump tables to access functionality. Amstrad BASIC was written to expose as much of this platform and firmware as possible to the programmer.

=== Firmware jump blocks ===
At a machine level on the CPC platform, application software need not be concerned with code moving about in the actual firmware (e.g. for different versions and re-assembly) so long as it uses the documented jump block addresses. For example, the firmware call TXT_PRINT_CHAR is ubiquitous - but note from below the firmware vectors are different in BASIC 1.0 and BASIC 1.1 ($9400 vs $93FE). In many machines, re-assemblies of the firmware and subsequent moving of routines can cause major headaches, but with the CPC platform so long as software uses the published jump block calls (i.e. $BB5A), software will run on all CPC platforms with no issues.


The firmware jumps have changed between versions but the address for TXT_PRINT_CHAR remains $BB5A.

=== The firmware modules ===

 Kernel
 Key Manager
 Text VDU
 Graphics VDU
 Screen Pack
 Cassette / AMSDOS (AMStrad Disc Operating System)
 Sound Manager
 Machine Pack
 Maths Pack

Amstrad BASIC leveraged and exposed the platform being written to take full advantage of the machine, bundling up BASIC code into the requisite calls into the firmware, providing specific commands for functionality rather than reliance on generic *FX or PEEK &amp; POKE statements required to access features on competitor platforms.

== BASIC and version differences ==
Internal version numbers of the BASIC ROM differ from the accepted, published versions discussed here.

Although not unique, the platform was unusual among contemporaries in that it used the ASCII character set rather than its own idiosyncratic form - an arguable strength as it instantly made the CPC platform a more serious offering, somewhat underpinning Amstrad&#x27;s marketing claims of it being capable of professional business use.

In common with many other dialects, multiple program statements were separated on a single line using the colon codice_2.

codice_3 is the only loop construct other than codice_4.

Reserved words (functions, commands, statements etc.) are capitalized in a program by virtue of being tokenized. This reduces program size and accelerates execution. Listing a program then decodes the token to its reserved word which are all in upper case in the token table (it was this method which revealed the presence of DEC$ in BASIC 1.0 - see below). When saving a basic program, the fully tokenized form is saved in a binary format. Alternatively, saving with option &quot;A&quot; creates a fully text compatible ascii file e.g. codice_5

=== BASIC 1.0 ===
Supplied with the Amstrad CPC464, it was a good release with only a single notable bug, being the codice_6 function (it provides codice_7 style output but as a string rather than screen output). No time was available to fix this before the software had to go for ROM chip production. Consequently, the function was simply left un-documented and pre-fixed to force a syntax error when encountered. The curious programmer found the word codice_8 capitalised in their code indicating it was a recognised reserved word - inexplicable at the time, until the history of the bug and disassemblies of the BASIC ROM became available.

Exploration of the BASIC 1.0 ROM can find the remnants of the function and its crippled token table entry.

=== BASIC 1.1 ===
Supplied with the CPC664/6128, besides fixing DEC$, it introduced (among others) the following additional keywords:

COPYCHR$, CURSOR, FILL, FRAME, GRAPHICS PAPER, GRAPHICS PEN and MASK

It also introduced a clumsy but adequate method of trapping disc errors with the codice_9 function. Errors still had to be trapped in the usual way with codice_10 but the single &quot;Broken In&quot; error 32 could now be expanded to provide more detail. Examining DERR gives up to ten further indicators. Values returned are the AMSDOS error number plus 128, e.g. 14 is reported as a DERR value of 142 (14+128). Possible errors included the usual file not found, disk full etc. as well as the more specific &quot;142 - The stream is not in a suitable state&quot; and &quot;149 - Disc changed while files were open&quot;. DERR is a function of BASIC 1.1 and so was not available on the FDI1 expanded CPC464, with its combination of AMSDOS and BASIC 1.0. Disc errors on the CPC464 were obtainable but relied on codice_11ing into the AMSDOS system area, such program being incompatible with CPC664/6128 due to the AMSDOS variable addresses having moved.

== Variables and functions ==
Variable names must begin with a letter but can have up to 40 character long names made up of codice_12, the digits codice_13 and the codice_14 symbol. Names are case-insensitive, but case-as-typed is maintained in program listings.

Three data-types are supported signified by an identifier suffix on the variable name and can be selectively presumed by use of the codice_15 and codice_16 directives: 
Unlike some dialects, variable names are unique down to type, e.g. codice_17 and codice_18 are separate variables.

Dimensioned variables (arrays) have 0 as their lowest element number(s), and can use square brackets around their elements which helps distinguish them from other parentheses in complex expressions in program code. e.g. codice_19 can be written as codice_20.

Named single-line functions are supported and follow the type and name convention of variables but pre-fixed with codice_21. e.g. codice_22

The address of a variable in memory can be determined with the @ directive, e.g. codice_23. This replaces the VARPTR() function found in other dialects of BASIC and is mostly used to pass a variable pointer to machine code routines allowing bi-directional data transfer.

Integer and Real variable values are stored in the variable table (see memory map below). String variable &quot;contents&quot; are stored on the heap. This allows the aggregation of fragmented memory via Garbage Collection. Consequently, for strings, the variable table held a three byte descriptor made up of the length of the variable and the address in the heap where the actual contents are to be found.

=== Two missed opportunities? ===
BBC Basic uses a clever method for handling some integer variables, which despite claims of its heavy influence on Locomotive BASIC (and by extension Amstrad BASIC), was not replicated in the latter. BBC BASIC has a 54-byte table reserved for the values of the 27 single letter integers codice_24 so they do not occupy nor require lookup in the variable table - a simple left-shift and addition is all that is required to determine the value of a given variable. This makes access to the subject variables very fast and considering their ubiquitous use, it is perhaps, surprising this mechanism was not used in Amstrad BASIC.

For strings, the descriptor is three bytes in the variable table, made up of a length descriptor and a further (little-endian) address of the actual payload. Had the value returned by @ been the two byte address in the heap (and the length prefix moved to the heap also) this would have substantially reduced access time by replacing the two address lookups with just one.

Variable table structure for strings.

== Graphics and colour ==
Handling of graphics and colour was straightforward with commands such as codice_25 etc.

With Amstrad BASIC V1.1 (CPC664 onwards), the codice_26 command permitted painting complex-shaped, bounded areas of the screen and an eight bit mask could be applied DRAW enabling dotted lines etc.

A table giving the numeric codes for the 27 system colors was printed on the casing of the built-in 3&quot; disk drive on the 664 and later machines.

== Text handling ==
Text moved through the system using a concept of &quot;streams&quot; numbered 0–9, appropriate commands used the hash codice_27 symbol to pre-fix the stream number.

Streams 0-7 are text windows. The TEXT_VDU firmware pack allows for the creation of multiple text windows each with their own cursor, dimensions, content, colours etc. An individual window is addressed using its stream number, e.g. codice_28. Omitting this defaults to stream 0 - codice_29 being equivalent to codice_30. Text windows are simple screen areas and can overlap but there is no built in provision to preserve the contents of windows &quot;under&quot; others, thus careful attention is required to avoid corruption. Later, machine code routines became available to intercept the firmware calls (by patching the jump block) and preserve the content of a window just before another was drawn over it, restoring it when the new window closed. This gave the much more useful &quot;Windows&quot; look to which we have grown accustomed - being mindful of the times; &quot;pop-ups&quot; were a novel concept in 1984. When using the text windows, screen scrolling relies on software (as only part of the screen content is moved) rather than using the hardware to scroll the entire screen by adjusting the screen-base offset of the CRT controller in RAM. Two SCREEN_PACK firmware calls are provided for the two forms; $BC4D SCR_HW_ROLL (Scrolls the entire screen up or down by eight pixel rows i.e. one character line) and $BC50 SCR_SW_ROLL (Scrolls part of the screen up or down by eight pixel lines). The latter can result in a pronounced &quot;ripple&quot; when scrolling large areas.

Stream 8 is the centronics parallel port. To send a line of text to the printer one could use the command codice_31. Creating a printed listing was simply a matter of LISTing the program to stream 8, e.g. codice_32. This flexible method dispenses with the legacy BASIC commands codice_33 and codice_34. When later, serial interfaces became available and opened up access to a greater range of printers and other devices, #8 could be diverted by patching $BD2B MC_PRINT_CHAR in the MACHINE_PACK jumpblock.

Stream 9 is the currently open file (either cassette or disc, input or output) and relevant commands are context sensitive; e.g. it is possible to have both input and output files open simultaneously with codice_35 and codice_36 routing text accordingly.

== Advanced features ==
A stand-out feature among almost every other BASIC of the time was a timer-based software interrupt mechanism at 50 ticks per second using the codice_37, codice_38 and codice_39 commands (leveraging the KERNEL for its software interrupts). Four timers were available; 0–3, with associated reducing priority - a BASIC imposition not a platform limitation and allowed the programmer to run sections of their BASIC program, asynchronously, after a given delay, repeating if required, e.g. codice_40 produces a repeating one-second call with no further work. When answering an EVERY or AFTER, there is an implicit disabling (see DI below) of all lower-priority interrupts which is automatically cleared by the corresponding codice_41. As with all Interrupt Service Routines (ISR), such GOSUBs should be kept as short as possible, rather setting a flag for further processing of large chunks of program than trying to complete it inside the ISR.

The interrupt ability requires some method to limit its impact when unwanted. Two commands; codice_42 and codice_43 Disable and Enable BASIC interrupts respectively. DI should be used sparingly as it will interfere with all BASIC interrupt driven functionality: timers, colour flashing, keyboard scanning, sound output etc., thus program enclosed by DI and EI should be considered to have the same requirements as ISRs to avoid stunted program flow.

Amstrad BASIC granted a relatively high level of control over the sound chip, an AY-3-8912 with 3 tone channels and 1 noise channel and interrupt driven sound generation with comprehensive co-ordination of the three audio channels and associated BASIC commands: codice_44 (Sound Queue), codice_45 etc. The same chip was also used on late-model ZX Spectrums, as well as the Atari ST and MSX computers, but none of those had such a complete built-in codice_46 command. Many things, from selecting a particular channel or a combination of channels, setting envelopes, volume, pitch, noise, and so on could be done with a single codice_46 command, with up to 7 parameters. Granted, especially complex and/or low-level techniques could not be done with BASIC due to their requiring more precise or direct access to the hardware, e.g. especially complex music from trackers (including simulated chords using arpeggios, etc.), the playback of digitally sampled sounds as in the game RoboCop for example, and so on.

All disc, tape and file management managed by BASIC is through the firmware and were adequate for simple file management with commands such as codice_48 etc. During this time, it was common for desktop computers to be &quot;boot to BASIC&quot; and that supplied with most low-cost home computers also acted as a simple operating system, managing files and moving program code and data between the machine and storage medium.

Also available was a parametric codice_49 command, allowing, for example, to load a file containing &quot;raw&quot; picture data into video memory, causing it to be displayed, with a couple of BASIC instructions. Adding a memory address as parameter to the commands codice_49 or codice_51 would allow easy loading of raw uncompressed 16 KB screen pictures.

== Machine code support and RSXs ==
Machine code was well supported (but not to the impressive heights of the BBC Micro&#x27;s, in-line assembler). There was an easy method of allocating &quot;safe&quot; memory (see below) and once loaded either from disc or cassette or codice_52d in, Z80 machine code could be executed with codice_53. CALL supported a method to pass parameters to the machine code using BASIC variables (including strings) using the form codice_54. Integer variables and integer immediates can be passed directly as their value (ByVAL). All variables, but specifically strings can be passed using the codice_55 directive, which points to the address of the variable descriptor (ByREF). Thus, machine code can pass values directly back to a variable or manipulate its contents making transfer of data between a BASIC program and machine code trivial.

Another method, leveraging the firmware, allowed for named sections of machine code using a feature known as Resident System eXtensions (RSX). Although not a purely BASIC feature, Amstrad BASIC embraces this mechanism of RSXs and the names can be used in the program as if they were BASIC reserved keywords - each being prefixed with the bar codice_56 symbol, the remaining syntax being identical to CALL. e.g. codice_57 (note a comma is required between the RSX name and any arguments). The code for the RSXs had a very specific header structure - the RSX names, their entry points and 4 bytes of scratchpad RAM for the firmware to link in and out of the list. A call was made using the KERNEL routine $BCD1 KL_LOG_EXT to initialise the names and they are then available to use throughout the system (by finding each named section using $BCD4 KL_FIND_COMMAND - BASIC does this for | commands). A major advantage of RSXs is not needing to know the address of a piece of machine code (CALL can only access the main 64KB address map, however configured) - the KERNEL returns the parameters necessary to execute the code in question no matter where it resides, in the entire memory map and in all ROM/RAM banks (see &quot;bank switching&quot; below). Code could simply call sideways by searching for the RSX name and from the link structure, the firmware immediately knows which ROM/RAM bank the code occupies. codice_58, codice_59 etc. configure the banks and run the machine code. Thus all memory is usable for machine code program. Use of RSXs ensured that machine code in sideways ROMs was fully integrated with BASIC and the disc commands codice_60 etc. all resided in ROM and were used throughout BASIC program code. On the CPC464, disc commands were only added when the FDI1 (floppy disc interface, with its sideways ROM) was plugged in the rear expansion port.

In UK CPC circles at that time, is was popular to pun words that began with &quot;bar&quot; and name RSXs accordingly, e.g. |BQ, |BARASTREISAND, |STARD etc.

== Memory allocation and management ==
Generally speaking, BASIC programmers do not have to concern themselves too much with the inner workings of their chosen platform to get decent results. Should a programmer wish to ignore them and stick only to BASIC, they are well catered-for with a speedy, rich dialect. For those who want to go beyond and want more control, they are likewise accommodated.

In many contemporary systems, allocating a block of memory seems an after-thought with no &quot;proper&quot; method of achieving it. Innovative methods were adopted by programmers which resulted in some, often, highly cryptic and fiddly methods, such as creating codice_61 statements with the required length and then codice_62ing the data into known addresses in the BASIC program line - the command codice_63 was famous in ZX81 circles. 16514 being the address of the first byte after a REM statement, on the first line of a BASIC program - the only piece of memory guaranteed not to move around or be corrupted with added program lines, garbage collect etc.

Amstrad BASIC program space occupies RAM from $170 extending to somewhere around $A6F0 (varies with BASIC version and other considerations), just under the BASIC system area, AMSDOS area and the high jump blocks - approximately 41KB. Numeric variables and functions etc. are located immediately above the program with the remaining, free memory in between termed &quot;the heap&quot;. The contents of string variables are stored in the heap near the very top, with just the string descriptors being stored in similar fashion to numerics in the variable table - just above the program (see Variables and functions above). BASIC program code grew up and strings grew down towards each other in RAM, gradually consuming the heap in between. Amstrad BASIC has a garbage collector which de-fragments the heap to maximise usable memory - as with most computer languages, as strings are created then sliced/deleted, chunks of previously used memory occur between used parts and the heap can become &quot;porous&quot;. Notably the BBC Micro did not have garbage collect and manipulation of strings could result in &quot;out of memory&quot; errors simply because a requested block did not exist in one chunk. In common with other dialects, Amstrad BASIC provides the FRE() function to return the amount of free heap. The function uses two forms: codice_64, e.g. PRINT FRE(0), returns the size, in bytes, of the largest single block in the heap. The second form, codice_65, forces a garbage collect and so, returns a true count of free heap. Used areas (mainly strings and temporary structures) are aggregated at the top of the heap with no gaps - data is moved and pointers updated, leaving available heap as a single chunk of memory extending down to the program and variables. This latter form can take some time to run on badly fragmented systems. Should an &quot;Out of memory&quot; error be imminent due to no free heap, Amstrad BASIC performs a garbage collection immediately prior to stopping the program in an attempt to rescue the situation. Consequently, it was not necessary for the programmer to concern themselves overly and FRE() is more informational than essential.

Amstrad BASIC provides the function, codice_66, which returns the last address used by BASIC i.e. the very last address before the system areas. The codice_67 command can be used to adjust this address and through a combination of the two, space can be reserved easily and controllably - a primitive form of codice_68. For example, suppose a block of 1KB was required, space could be reserved (with full consent/awareness of BASIC) using codice_69 - adjusting down the maximum extent of BASIC memory use. Machine code, say, could then be safely loaded into and called at codice_70, safe from other processes and accidental relocation/corruption.

The CPC range made provision, through the SCREEN_PACK, for User Defined Graphics (UDG) whereby the 8x8 pixel matrix for a character could be redefined allowing for the creation of special characters. By default, the top 16 characters (128 bytes) were &quot;soft&quot; and if that was sufficient, no further adjustment was required. Following on the ethos of exposing the platform capabilities in BASIC, it passed forward this functionality and the memory for UDG was allocated from the heap (i.e. the more characters, the lower codice_66). More characters (and thus more RAM) could be allocated with the codice_72 command - where char represents the character code from which UDG is available. e.g. codice_73 would allow the entire printable ASCII character set to be redefined, with the corresponding reduction in available program space (1784 bytes). The firmware copied the default character matrices from ROM into the newly allocated space, thus defining the character matrix was not essential for clarity. If UDG were not required, memory could be returned to BASIC (resulting in fixed character matrices) with the command codice_74.

The simplified default CPC memory map as it appears to BASIC.
== A notable omission - memory bank switching ==
Although as a BASIC implementation, Amstrad BASIC is fairly complete and goes to great pains to support the CPC platform, one notable omission in all versions is native access to the memory bank switching mechanism used to expand the Z80 memory space; re-using address ranges by overlaying sections of physical ROM or RAM.

Through an arrangement of the custom circuitry, switching pages into one of the four 16KB pages in the Z80 memory map ($0xxx, $4xxx, $8xxx, $Cxxx) was possible. For instance, the top page ($C000) is occupied by both the video RAM, the BASIC ROM and (on disc equipped machines) the AMSDOS ROM with the hardware and firmware providing the necessary control of access. The firmware ROM was bank-switched to the lower 16KB, extra RAM (that beyond the Z80 64KB e.g. the additional 64KB of the CPC6128) and sideways ROMs (containing user machine code or 3rd party software) are mapped to the top page ($C000) - RAM could actually be mapped to any bank. The CRT controller generally mapped to the 16KB video RAM at $C000 in the main Z80 address space with the hardware ensuring the video picture is not interrupted when other banks were switched into the same page. All CPC models supported this fairly advanced (for the time) bank-switching to increase the potential memory storage - even an un-expanded CPC464 uses fully 96KB of ROM and RAM mapped into the Z80 64KB address space.

Memory writes are always applied only to RAM in the main 64KB address space, regardless of switched state, e.g. if the lower ROM ($0-$3FFF) is switched into the memory map, codice_75 will write into RAM regardless. Various configurations of where the switched banks occurred in the memory map were supported by the KERNEL.

The CPC464/664 hardware can address up to 256KB including up to eight 16KB sideways ROMs. One position is used by the BASIC ROM and both the CPC664 and CPC464 expanded with the FDI1, use a further slot for the AMSDOS ROM - leaving six slots. The CPC6128 hardware permitted bank switching up to 4MB with increased space for 16 (32 with a PCB hack) 16KB sideways ROMs. Again, two positions were occupied with BASIC and AMSDOS leaving 14 available for user or 3rd parties. The KERNEL provides several methods of accessing banked memory; some involve a pseudo 24bit address via a vector, extending the HL register pair using the C register and for ROMS only, encoding the high or low ROM switch in the top few bits of a 16-bit address. Still others can retrieve data from a bank as if it were in the mainstream Z80 address map or directly from the main 64KB of RAM regardless of the state of the banks. Kernel routines to access banked memory include codice_76 among others. Prior to &quot;calling sideways&quot;, i.e. switching in a bank and jumping to execute machine code at an address there, the kernel assembles structures on the Z80 stack to ensure the safe landing of inbound codice_77urns from banked memory, restoring the state of the banks and ensuring code execution continues without issue. It was quite normal to have calls between banked ROMs, indeed this happens seamlessly every time BASIC uses AMSDOS (disc commands) as both ROMs occupy the same physical address space.

Despite BASIC not providing support for this kernel functionality, use of banked memory in a BASIC program was certainly possible but required the use of machine code routines to do the switch and take advantage of the result. Banked memory could not be used for BASIC program code.

On the bundled CP/M 2.2 and CP/M+ (CPC6128) discs was a two-part program to add primitive-but-adequate bank-switching commands to BASIC. When run, codice_78 reserves 1317 bytes of RAM into which; it loads codice_79, makes a call to that binary and then deletes itself. The latter file contains machine code to initialise a set of RSXs to enable RAM bank switching from BASIC programs. Functionality includes saving and loading screens from banks, copying between banks etc. It was not generally considered practical though as it is necessary to include both BANKMAN files with your own software products and run them at the command prompt before your own program can take advantage of bank switching RAM. To add further hindrance, although not copyrighted, BANKMAN.BAS is saved in protected mode (SAVE&quot;&lt;my_prog&gt;&quot;,p) and so is not listable - meaning that you cannot easily determine the method to load the RSXs and so use them in your own programs - to eliminate the two-stage start up.

Besides using banked memory to store screen images and rapidly switch between them, some applications implemented &quot;RAM Discs&quot; but these were not supported under the cassette/AMSDOS firmware, being quite proprietary.

== Contemporary rivals ==
Unlike the Commodore 64&#x27;s built in BASIC (Commodore BASIC), which had no dedicated commands for graphics or sound, Amstrad BASIC allowed doing pretty much anything that was within the standard capabilities of the machine. This was not unimportant, as some other machines of the era required programmers to use assembler in order to access the full sound and graphics capabilities of their system. MSX, Sinclair Spectrum and some others offered a similar, more or less complete command set for their sound and graphics capabilities. The only things going clearly beyond BASIC capabilities were the overscan modes used in games and demos, 27-color graphics modes, digital sound playback, and smooth scrolling.

Unlike Sinclair BASIC or Commodore 64 BASIC, which had various keyboard command shortcuts or specialized keys for choosing symbols or colors, Amstrad BASIC keywords were typed in full and the interpreter parsed, recognized and tokenised them. However, there were abbreviations like &quot;codice_80&quot; for &quot;codice_81&quot; and a few shortcuts. Programs could be saved onto Compact Cassette or floppy disk and retrieved as binary or ASCII files.

<doc id="327744" wikidata="Q265039" url="?curid=327744" title="MSX BASIC">
<text>MSX BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language. It is an extended version of Microsoft&#x27;s MBASIC Version 4.5, adding support for graphic, music, and various peripherals attached to MSX microcomputers. Generally, MSX BASIC is designed to follow GW-BASIC, released the same year for IBM PCs and clones. During the creation of MSX BASIC, effort was made to make the system flexible and expandable.

== Distribution ==

MSX BASIC came bundled in the ROM of all MSX computers. At system start-up MSX BASIC is invoked, causing its command prompt to be displayed, unless other software placed in ROM takes control (which is the typical case of game cartridges and disk interfaces, the latter causing the MSX-DOS prompt to be shown if there is a disk present which contains the DOS system files).

When MSX BASIC is invoked, the ROM code for BIOS and the BASIC interpreter itself are visible on the lower 32K of the Z80 addressing space. The upper 32K are set to RAM, of which about 23K to 28K are available for BASIC code and data (the exact amount depends on the presence of disk controller and on the MSX-DOS kernel version).

== Development Environment ==
MSX BASIC development environment is very similar to other versions of Microsoft BASIC. It has a command line-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) system; all program lines must be numbered, all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in direct mode (i.e., to be executed immediately). The user interface is entirely command-line-based.

== Versions of MSX BASIC ==
Every new version of the MSX computer was bundled with an updated version of MSX BASIC. All versions are backward compatible and provide new capabilities to fully explore the new and extended hardware found on the newer MSX computers.

=== MSX BASIC 1.0 ===
* Bundled with MSX1 computers
* 16 KB in size
* No native support for floppy disk requiring the Disk BASIC cartridge extension (4 KB overhead)
* Support for all available screen modes:
** Screen 0 (text mode 40 x 24 characters)
** Screen 1 (mixed text mode 32 x 24 characters, sprites and colored custom characters)
** Screen 2 (high resolution graphic mode 256 x 192 pixels, 16 colors)
** Screen 3 (low resolution graphic mode 64×48 - 4×4 pixel blocks over the screen 2 resolution)
* Full support for hardware sprites and interrupt-driven automatic collision detection
* Full support for the General Instruments AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG)

Note that the Brazilian MSX &quot;clones&quot; by Sharp and Gradiente show other versions of MSX BASIC (on the Sharps even called HOT-BASIC), but they&#x27;re basically just unlicensed MSX BASIC 1.0.

=== MSX BASIC 2.0 / 2.1 ===
* Bundled with MSX2 computers
* 32 KB in size (First 16 KB directly available, second 16 KB in other slot and has to be paged in/out for usage)
* Added support for new available screen modes, including graphic modes with 212 progressive or 424 interlaced lines:
** Updated Screen 0 (text mode 80 x 24)
** Screen 5 (graphic mode 256 x 212/424 pixels, 16 colors out of 512)
** Screen 6 (graphic mode 512 x 212/424 pixels, 4 colors out of 512)
** Screen 7 (graphic mode 512 x 212/424 pixels, 16 colors out of 512)
** Screen 8 (graphic mode 256 x 212/424 pixels, 256 colors, no palette)
* Added support for multicolored sprites (16 colors)
* Added support for hardware accelerated graphics functions (copy, fill, blitting, etc.)
* Added support for using the lower 32K RAM of the computer (not directly visible because the BIOS and BASIC interpreter ROMs take over the addressing space) as a limited RAM disk (only certain types of files could be saved). MSX BASIC 2.1 supports using the memory mapper (if available on the machine) to expand this RAM disk to almost 90 KB.

MSX BASIC 2.1 exists on computers like the Philips MSX2 machines (except for the VG 8230), the Yamaha YIS-805 and Sanyo MPC-2300.

=== MSX BASIC 3.0 ===
* Bundled with MSX2+ computers
* 32 KB in size (First 16 KB directly available, second 16 KB in other slot and has to be paged in/out for usage)
* Added command codice_1 for smooth, hardware based scrolling in BASIC
* Added support for new available screen modes:
** Screen 10 (graphic mode 256 x 212/424 pixels, 12499 YJK at once + 16 colors out of 512 RGB in ML)
** Screen 11 (graphic mode 256 x 212/424 pixels, 12499 YJK at once + 16 colors out of 512 RGB)
** Screen 12 (graphic mode 256 x 212/424 pixels, 19268 YJK at once)

=== MSX BASIC 4.0 ===
* Bundled with the Panasonic FS-A1ST MSX turbo R model
* Added _PAUSE command to make delays in BASIC independent of the current CPU and clock
* Added extra commands for the PCM device (codice_2, codice_3)

=== MSX BASIC 4.1 ===
* Bundled with the Panasonic FS-A1GT MSX turbo R model
* Added MIDI extensions
==Sample==
== Extensions of MSX BASIC ==
Since MSX BASIC was meant to be expandable from inception, it was possible to write add-on modules quite easily. Support for specific hardware was commonly added by means of expansion cartridges, which also served as the interface to the hardware in question. MSX Disk-BASIC is an example, bundled in the cartridge that provides the hardware interface to the disk drives, it adds commands to access the floppy disk drives.

<doc id="327745" wikidata="Q2974596" url="?curid=327745" title="Magh Slécht">
<text>Magh Slécht (sometimes Anglicised as Moyslaught; A variant of Magh Lecht meaning &quot;a grave-strewn plain&quot;, because of all the ancient stone tombs therein) is the name of a historic plain in Ireland. It comprises an area of about three square miles (8 km2) situated in the south-eastern part of the Parish of Templeport, Barony of Tullyhaw, in the west of County Cavan. It is bounded on the south by Templeport Lough, on the north by Slieve Rushen mountain, on the east by the Shannon–Erne Waterway, and on the west by the River Blackwater. Magh Slécht formed part of the Province of Connacht until the late 16th century, when it was made part of the Province of Ulster by the English Crown.

It was originally named Magh Senaig (plain of the hill-slope) and under this guise is mentioned in &quot;The Metrical Dindshenchas&quot; in the story of the Dagda, Corrgenn and Ailech, wherein it states the Corrgenn travelled from Tara to Lough Foyle in the Inishowen peninsula &quot;via&quot; Mag Senaig.

In Pre-Christian times the small area where the Crom Cruach idol stood at Killycluggin and Kilnavert was originally named &quot;Fossa Slécht&quot; or &quot;Rath Slécht&quot; and it is from this small location that the wider Magh Slécht area received its name. In 1911 BC during the reign of Fodbgen, the Firbolg High-King of Ireland, the name Magh Senaig was changed to Magh Slécht (&quot;The plain of prostrations&quot;) as it became the nationwide centre of the cult of the god Crom Cruach. Another interpretation is Magh Sleacht meaning the &quot;Plain of the Monument&quot;.

St. Patrick is said to have thrown down Crom Cruaich when he stretched out the Bachal Isu from a neighbouring hill causing it to fall over with its head pointing toward the Hill of Tara. The twelve surrounding idols were then swallowed up by the earth.

Another name for the plain was Magh Lecet or Magh Leced. The ancient Irish prayed by prostrating themselves in a similar fashion to today&#x27;s Muslims, i.e. by kneeling down on both knees and touching the forehead against the earth [citation needed]. The plain is not flat but consists of little drumlin hills. However, as it is surrounded by mountains, it is a plain in comparison. In the old Irish tale &quot;The Siege of Druim Damhgaire or Knocklong&quot; (&quot;Forbhais Droma Dámhgháire&quot;), one of King Cormac Mac Art&#x27;s druids was called Cecht of Magh Slécht.

==Occupation==

This area has been in constant occupation from pre-4000 BC up to the present day, as is evidenced by the huge number of ancient monuments which still survive. In a small area of there are over 80 monuments of different types, with many others bound to be discovered by future archaeological searches. It is the densest grouping of such monuments in County Cavan and possibly in Ireland.

Included are
* 9 megalithic tombs
* 7 Ring barrows
* 3 different stone circles
* 9 different standing stones
* 2 stone-rows
* 5 enclosures
* 6 crannogs
* 33 ráths or souterrains
* 3 Early-Christian church-sites
* 2 Early-Christian Holy Wells
* 2 Bullauns
* 2 Medieval castles

The area was first inhabited by Neolithic hunter-gatherers who arrived via the river (originally called the Gráinne river &amp; now canalised as the Woodford Canal or the Shannon-Erne Waterway). The first named inhabitants were the Masraige tribe who ruled Magh Slécht until they were conquered by the Uí Briúin tribe in the 8th century AD. The Masraighe were also called the &quot;Sons of the Liath&quot; or the &quot;Tuatha Slécht&quot; and Magh Slécht was sometimes called &quot;Liathmhuine&quot;. It is of interest that Conall Gulban, the first nobleman baptised by St. Patrick, thus opening the way for the conversion of the ruling classes of Ireland, was murdered by the Masraige at &quot;Magh Slécht&quot; (County Cavan) in 464. He was buried by Saint Caillin at Fenagh, County Leitrim. The descendants of the Ui Briuin included the McGovern clan who are still the most numerous surname in the area.

==Historical events==

The main events in the history of Magh Slécht as listed in the ancient sources are 
# The Journey of Corrgenn through Mag Senaig in 2000 BC
# The killing of Regan, the Fomorian, at Tomregan in 1860 BC.
# The death of the High King of Ireland, Tigernmas, &amp; 4,000 of his followers in the Seventh Plague of Ireland while worshipping Crom Cruaich on 31 October (Samhain, Halloween), 1413 B.C. His grave there is marked by a standing stone.
# The Battle of Tuaim Drecain (Tomregan) in 1342 BC by the High King Eochaid Faebar Glas.

<doc id="327748" wikidata="Q1146631" url="?curid=327748" title="Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge">
<text>Lucy Cavendish College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge.

The college is named in honour of Lucy Cavendish (1841–1925), who campaigned for the reform of women&#x27;s education.

==History==
The college was founded in 1965 by female academics of the University of Cambridge who believed that the university offered too few and too restricted opportunities for women as either students or academics. Its origins are traceable to the &quot;Society of Women Members of the Regent House who are not Fellows of Colleges&quot; (informally known as the Dining Group) which in the 1950s sought to provide the benefits of collegiality to its members who, being female, were not college fellows. At the time there were only two women&#x27;s colleges in Cambridge, Girton and Newnham, insufficient for the large and growing numbers of female academic staff in the university.

The college was named in honour of Lucy Caroline Cavendish, a pioneer of women&#x27;s education and the great aunt of one of its founders, Margaret Braithwaite. First formally recognised as the &quot;Lucy Cavendish Collegiate Society&quot;, it moved to its current site in 1970, received consent to be called Lucy Cavendish College in 1986, and gained the status of a full college of the university by Royal Charter in 1997.

The first president of the college, from 1965 to 1970, was Anna McClean Bidder, one of the founding members of the Dining Group and a zoologist specialising in cephalopod digestion; this accounts for the presence of the nautilus shell in the college coat of arms. She was succeeded by Kate Bertram until 1979, Phyllis Hetzel (Lady Bowden), Dame Anne Warburton, Baroness Perry of Southwark, Dame Veronica Sutherland, Janet Todd and Jackie Ashley. The current and ninth president of Lucy Cavendish is Madeleine Atkins, who took up the post in 2018.

With effect from October 2021, Lucy Cavendish has admitted both women and men from the standard university age. The college gave as its primary reason for the change &quot;to grow graduate and undergraduate numbers to support the University and the other colleges in making more places available for excellent students from under-represented backgrounds.&quot; The mission of the college was to open the Cambridge door to talented and exceptional students from under-represented and non-traditional backgrounds. Lucy Cavendish, uniquely in Cambridge, became broadly representative in its UK student body of the UK&#x27;s national society. On 4 December 2019 the college appointed its first male fellows. In the 2022 admission cycle, Lucy Cavendish became the first University of Cambridge college to admit more than 90% of its undergraduates from state schools.

== College site ==
For the first few years of the college&#x27;s existence it occupied rooms first in Silver Street and then in Northampton Street. In 1970 it moved to its current site on the corner of Madingley Road and Lady Margaret Road, near Westminster College and St John&#x27;s College, which had provided some of the land.

In 1991 the college bought &quot;Balliol Croft&quot;, a neighbouring house to its grounds and former home of the economist Alfred Marshall and his wife Mary Paley Marshall, with whom he wrote his first economics textbook. The building was renamed Marshall House in his honour and used for student accommodation until 2001 when it was converted back to its original layout and used as the President&#x27;s Lodge. Meanwhile, the majority of the college&#x27;s buildings, including Warburton Hall and the library, were completed in the 1990s.

The college is situated on a site just north-west of central Cambridge bounded by Madingley Road and Lady Margaret Road. It is based around three converted 19th-century villas and a new eco-friendly and accessible Passivhaus building. The new accommodation building meets and exceeds the Passivhaus standard and 100% of the college&#x27;s electricity is supplied by renewables. In 2022 the college received the Platinum Award for Green Impact, the highest award offered by the United Nations’ programme for environmentally and socially sustainable practice.

There is accommodation for 235 students with a further 98 rooms near its main site. 

== Student body ==
Lucy Cavendish says it has more than 900 students, approximately 40% of whom are undergraduates. 

The 2022 intake has recorded an intake of 91.1% of new UK students from state schools or FE colleges compared to the University average of 72.5%.

Lucy Cavendish students are also called &quot;Lucians&quot;.

== Academic performance ==
The percentage of undergraduate/postgraduate students achieving 2.1 or 1st class honours degrees was 97% of all students eligible during 2020.

==Clubs and societies==
Students are encouraged to join some of the hundreds of clubs and societies across the university and in their academic department, in order to have a healthy life balance that makes them more successful as students and brings them friendships and contacts they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have had. There is currently an art society, two choirs, a sewing and knitting society, a student magazine, the Lucy Cavendish College Boat Club, and teams for badminton, football and netball. There are societies based on the course (Tripos) such as Lucy Lawyers and the VetMed Society, with their programmes of talks, visits and social events.

== Lucy Cavendish Fiction Prize ==
The college hosts the Lucy Cavendish Fiction Prize, open to women novelists over the age of 18 years who have not yet been published. Its winners include and Claire Askew. Sarah Harman, Gail Honeyman and Sara Collins. It was sponsored by the Literary agency WME in 2024. It was founded by the academic Janet Todd.

<text>In the game of Vish (short for vicious circle), players compete to find circularity in dictionary definitions. Irish mathematician and physicist, John Lighton Synge, invented the multi-player, refereed game to emphasize the circular reasoning implicit in the defining process of any standard dictionary.

In his book, &quot;Projective Geometry&quot;, H.S.M. Coxeter cites &quot;Vish&quot; in his discussion of definitions in mathematics:

==Procedure==
#Each of the players is given a copy of the same standard dictionary;
#The referee gives each a slip of paper with the same word (found in this dictionary) written on each slip—word chosen so that it has synonyms in its definition, but (preferably) the definition of any synonym does not (in that dictionary) list a synonym which is the originally assigned word;
#At &quot;Go!&quot;, each looks up the assigned word, finds a synonym, looks that up, finds a synonym, etc.;
#The first player to be led, by this synonymous process, back to the originally assigned word cries &quot;Vish!&quot; and wins the game (unless his opponent successfully challenges the procedure of the alleged winner).

<text>The Joe Schmo Show is an American reality television hoax show created by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the cable network Spike for two seasons in 2003 and 2004, then revived for a third season in 2013. The series was again revived for a fourth season premiering on TBS in January 2025.

==Premise==
The show&#x27;s premise is that a target person or people are led to believe that they are contestants on a reality television show; in reality, all of the other participants in the purported show – including the host – are actors, and their actions and the outcome of the purported show are all scripted in an attempt to elicit comedic reactions from the targets. The show&#x27;s first season, The Joe Schmo Show, aired in 2003; its second season, Joe Schmo 2, aired in 2004; and a third season, The Joe Schmo Show: The Full Bounty, aired in 2013. The first season&#x27;s hoax was conducted as a typical reality competition show while the second hoax was a &quot;Bachelor&quot;-like dating series. In the third season, the hoax featured aspiring bounty hunters tracking down &quot;real&quot; fugitives.

Over the course of its run, the show&#x27;s cast of fake contestants has included several actors who would later become well known, including Kristen Wiig, Natasha Leggero, and Jon Huertas. The only performer consistently present across the first three &quot;Joe Schmo&quot; seasons was voice actor Ralph Garman, who served as the &quot;emcee&quot; for all three editions (playing a smarmier caricature of himself in the first, a pompous British man in the second, and a bounty hunter in the third).

The team behind the show also created reality television hoax show &quot;Invasion Iowa&quot;.

==Revival==
On May 17, 2023, TBS announced that it would revive &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; for a new fourth season with Cat Deeley as host, with the premiere initially planned for 2024. After a delay, the relaunch premiered on January 21, 2025. In this latest incarnation, the real and fake contestants participate in an elaborate competition known as &quot;The GOAT&quot;, a supposed Americanized adaptation of a popular (and fictitious) South Korean series.

==Episodes==

===&quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; (2003)===

The target of season one was Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania native Matt Kennedy Gould. The other &quot;contestants&quot; are archetypes of common reality TV show participants.

Two actors made brief appearances in supporting roles: Ryan Raddatz played Molly&#x27;s boyfriend, William (who feigned shock at seeing her in a bikini), and Steve Ireland played David Decker, a &quot;network executive&quot; who negotiated with Gould to finish the &quot;Meal Not Quite Fit for a King&quot; challenge.

For the hoax, the producers named the faux-reality show &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot;, with a $100,000 top prize &quot;awarded&quot; to the &quot;winner.&quot; Perhaps in an attempt to keep things as close to actual reality shows as possible, at the end of every episode an eviction ceremony was conducted in which each contestant voted to evict someone, and the person with the most votes was eliminated. After the written finish was executed, the actor in question would take a plate with their face painted on it and give it to Garman, who would then state a rhyming couplet that went &quot;Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, (name), you&#x27;re dead to us&quot; then throw the plate into the fireplace, breaking it. In the final episode, the three remaining &quot;players&quot; (in this case Gould, &quot;Brian&quot;, and &quot;Hutch&quot;) faced a final vote from the evicted &quot;houseguests&quot; (similar to the final Tribal Council on &quot;Survivor&quot;), with the one getting the most votes &quot;winning&quot;.

The show experienced an unexpected shift during an early episode. Earl (&quot;the Veteran&quot;) had bonded with Gould. When Earl was &quot;voted&quot; off the show, Gould began to weep and question his possible monetary gain at the cost of competing against his new friends. Both the other &quot;contestants&quot; and the show&#x27;s executives allegedly questioned the future of the show. While Gould was kept in the dark until the very end, the tone of the show was apparently altered (according to the voiceover of the early episodes). While the original premise had been to make situations funny at Gould&#x27;s expense, it became clear that the audience would sympathize too strongly with his earnestness; later games and contests were rigged to ensure he would win.

Gould&#x27;s sensitivity came to the forefront in a later episode featuring a sumo wrestling contest. Gould knocked down Kristen Wiig, playing &quot;Dr. Pat&quot;, causing a real-life head injury that forced her to be taken to the hospital. Gould eventually won the contest but was disturbed by the incident. The next day, when Wiig returned to the show, still in character, Gould gave her the all-expense-paid spa vacation he had won earlier.

The producers added a twist in the series when Hutch was eliminated due to breaking the rules. After the said elimination he returned and (as noted above) made the final, and he was declared the &quot;winner&quot; just before the hoax was revealed.

In the show&#x27;s October 28, 2003 finale, which aired to over 3.4 million viewers (the all-time record for a non-wrestling show on TNN/Spike up to that time), Gould learned the truth and received the $100,000 prize for which he was &quot;competing,&quot; along with the two vacations and a new plasma TV. He later recorded commentary that was included in &quot;Mo&#x27; Joe Schmo,&quot; a rebroadcast of the series. &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; was released on DVD with additional and uncensored footage in 2004.

Gould&#x27;s plaintive cry, &quot;What is going on?,&quot; delivered upon his discovery that the show was a fraud, became a popular catchphrase. Spike TV has since used the phrase at the end of the network&#x27;s other original productions, some of them involving Gould himself.

Some cast members have gone on to bigger success, including Kristen Wiig, who landed a regular spot on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2005, and also went on to co-write and star in the 2011 film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;; Lance Krall, creator, writer and lead of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Free Radio&quot;; Ralph Garman, a voice actor on &quot;Family Guy&quot; and co-host of &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot;; and David Hornsby, who is a writer, supervising producer, and performer on &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

Creator/producers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick went on to a number of projects, including the films &quot;Zombieland&quot; and &quot;Deadpool&quot;.

===&quot;Joe Schmo 2&quot; (2004)===

In 2004, Spike TV aired a second season of &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;, called Joe Schmo 2 and tagged, &quot;The Schmo must go on.&quot; Rather than duplicate the premise of the first season, producers satirized reality dating shows such as &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; with a fake show called &quot;Last Chance for Love&quot;. This time the premise was to fool two people, a man and a woman. The male role was filled by Tim Walsh, while Ingrid Wiese was chosen to be the female &quot;schmo&quot;. The series premiered on June 15, 2004.

Ralph Garman returned to host the second season as Derek Newcastle, dying his hair blond and wearing a fake beard, glasses, blue contact lenses, and false teeth plus spoke with a British accent so he would not be recognized by the new contestants.

The original &quot;Joe Schmo,&quot; Matt Kennedy Gould, taped a cameo appearance during an episode of &quot;Joe Schmo 2&quot; as a pizza delivery man, but the segment was cut when the network decided to shorten the episode; it did appear on the DVD. &quot;Joe Schmo 2&quot; was released on DVD with additional and uncensored footage in 2009.

The series took an unexpected twist within minutes of its beginning when Wiese became suspicious of some of her fellow contestants (especially when one — who had only been hired for the first episode as a &quot;contestant&quot; to be immediately eliminated, and was not aware of the nature of the program — told Wiese that her agent had arranged for her to appear on the show). Throughout the next few episodes, Wiese began noticing additional plot holes and moments that seemed scripted. Things reached a head when the character of &quot;Cammy&quot;, who was supposed to be telling Ingrid a secret, paused her story in order to allow the cameraman to change batteries. Wiese began openly questioning the contest, eventually stating during an interview segment that she did not believe it was real.

Since Walsh had not suspected anything was awry, the producers continued to conduct the show as it was while at the same time trying to figure out what to do with Wiese. It was finally decided that the producers would reveal to Wiese that she had correctly deduced that the entire thing was a hoax during an activity where Walsh was not present. Wiese was then made an offer: as long as she agreed to stay on the show, in effect becoming a cast member herself, and to not reveal the hoax to Walsh, she would receive the same $100,000 prize that Walsh would be given at the end of the series had he himself not figured the hoax out. Wiese agreed. In her place as the female &quot;schmo&quot;, Upper St. Clair Township, Pennsylvania native Amanda Naughton was added to the cast. Naughton was a contestant that previously was not chosen to appear on the show.

As with the first season, the cast members portrayed characters based on archetypes common to many dating game and reality shows. Wiese, was credited as the &quot;schmo turned actress&quot; when she was let on to the hoax. 
Two other actors (Timothy Brennan and Robin McDonald) had supporting roles in two separate episodes. In one episode, Brennan played Piper&#x27;s over-protective father, Frank, while McDonald played Piper&#x27;s loving mother, Betty. The next episode featured Brennan as Austin&#x27;s fun-loving father, Dallas, and McDonald as Austin&#x27;s strict mother, Lois. Each &quot;Schmo&quot; met the pair in only one of their two sets of roles.

After revealing the hoax to her and inviting her to join the other actors, producers also gave Wiese storylines of her own, including one in which her character was accused of faking a death of a grandfather (a reference to a on the then-recent &quot;&quot;) in a bid to win Austin&#x27;s affections. At one point, she was eliminated from the show, but was later allowed to return. Tim Walsh was also evicted at one point, but this was part of the ongoing storyline, and he also rejoined the contest soon after.

The show&#x27;s major ongoing plot involved the character of Bryce, who began stalking Piper, the Bachelorette, even after he was evicted twice from the show.

The series ultimately resolved itself at a &quot;promise ceremony&quot;, attended by all the previous contestants on the show, in which Piper and Austin, who it was revealed were in fact an estranged couple, were given the choice of either promising themselves to Amanda and Tim (the last two contestants), or marrying each other. Realizing their love had not died after all, Piper and Austin agreed to marry, but the ceremony was interrupted by the manic Bryce, who proclaimed his love for Piper, and then revealed the true nature of the program. After a tense moment (the producers were prepared for the usually easy-going but sometimes irritable Tim to react badly to the revelation), Tim broke the tension by exclaiming, &quot;Jackpot!&quot; The moment served as a humorous callback, as Walsh had used this exclamation several times throughout the course of the season.

All three &quot;Schmos&quot; (Walsh, Naughton, and Wiese) received the same amount ($100,000) that Gould earned in season one, plus vacation packages they won playing contests during the show. It was also stated that a Third World child would be adopted in Walsh&#x27;s name (the first episode had &quot;Ernie&quot; adopting a Third World child on behalf of Piper).

During the finale, Naughton recognized Natasha Leggero, one of the actresses who had been eliminated prior to Naughton&#x27;s arrival, because she had seen her perform as a stand-up comic. The discovery did not derail the illusion because Naughton did not know the false identity that Leggero had created for the show, having been brought into the program after Leggero&#x27;s character (Rita) had been eliminated from the program. However, Naughon&#x27;s reaction to Leggero did rattle Herzog, who became visibly anxious and took a moment before recovering and proceeding with his lines.

Much of the final episode detailed the immediate aftermath of the revelation to Amanda and Tim. During the episode, Valerie Azlynn, who had portrayed &quot;Bachelorette&quot; Piper, tearfully expressed remorse at the hoax. Both Amanda and Tim took the revelation of the hoax in relatively good (if somewhat stunned) spirit. As of January 2013, Amanda had found romance and was going by her married name of Amanda Mason, having given birth to her first child four months previously. She stated that &quot;her experience on the show made her feel dumb for only 30 seconds.&quot; Tim Walsh had found a wife and had two children. He had become an owner of a bar, which he later sold, then began overseeing operations at a bar, Town Hall, in Washington D.C.

===&quot;The Joe Schmo Show: The Full Bounty&quot; (2013)===

In January 2012, Spike TV announced it had picked up a new ten-episode series titled &quot;Full Bounty&quot;, described as &quot;a reality competition series featuring 12 aspiring bounty hunters who risk life and limb to chase down actual fugitives&quot;.

In August 2012, it was revealed that this announcement was in fact cover for a new season of &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; titled &quot;The Joe Schmo Show: The Full Bounty&quot;, which filmed in July 2012 and aired beginning on January 8, 2013. Ordered for ten episodes, with J. Holland Moore, a writer on the previous seasons, taking over as head writer and executive producer. The format featured a single contestant who believes he&#x27;s in a competition to become a bounty hunter, with $100,000 at stake in a parody of bounty hunter shows such as &quot;Dog The Bounty Hunter&quot;. The previous series host, Ralph Garman, returned this time in disguise as Jake Montrose, a seasoned bounty hunter who judged the contestant&#x27;s performances. As with previous versions of the program, the other 11 contestants are actors. Included among them for the first time is a recognizable celebrity: Lorenzo Lamas, star of 1990s bounty hunter series &quot;Renegade&quot;, playing a parody of himself. An early preview for the show&#x27;s return digitally blurred the new &quot;Schmo&#x27;s&quot; face and altered his voice, so as not to reveal his identity. The name of the Schmo was later revealed to be Chase Rogan, a 28-year-old native of Pennsylvania, who is a married sports fanatic and business owner. For the third time out of three seasons of the program, a chosen Joe Schmo hails from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The series premiered at 10 P.M. eastern time with two episodes. In the first episode, as he is introduced to his fellow contestants, Rogan does not actually recognize Lamas.

The cast once again featured numerous reality show archetypes:

==International versions==
&quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; was produced for TV2 in New Zealand by Touchdown Television as &quot;Living The Dream&quot; in 2004. The same year, France released &quot;Gloire et Fortune : La grande imposture (Fame and fortune: The great deception)&quot;. In 2006, the show arrived in Spain with the name of &quot;El Show de Cándido&quot; (&quot;The Candid Show&quot;) in season 1 and later renamed as &quot;El Show de Cándi-dos&quot; (&quot;The Candi-dos Show&quot;) in season 2 on the Spanish TV channel La Sexta by Globomedia (Promofilm).

<text>The prime minister of Croatia, officially the president of the government of the Republic of Croatia (), is Croatia&#x27;s head of government, and is &quot;de facto&quot; the most powerful and influential state officeholder in the Croatian system of government. Following the first-time establishment of the office in 1945, the 1990–2000 semi-presidential period is the only exception where the president of Croatia held &quot;de facto&quot; executive authority. In the formal Croatian order of precedence, however, the position of prime minister is the third highest state office, after the president of the Republic and the speaker of the Parliament.

The Constitution of Croatia prescribes that &quot;Parliament supervises the Government&quot; (Article 81) and that &quot;the President of the Republic ensures the regular and balanced functioning and stability of government&quot; (as a whole; Article 94), while the Government is introduced in Article 108. Since 2000, the prime minister has had various added constitutional powers and is mentioned before the Government itself in the text of the Constitution, in Articles 87, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104. The current prime minister of Croatia is Andrej Plenković. The Government of Croatia meets in Banski dvori, a historical building located on the west side of St. Mark&#x27;s Square in Zagreb.

==Name==

The official name of the office, literally translated, is &quot;President of the Government&quot; (&quot;Predsjednik / Predsjednica Vlade&quot;), rather than a literal translation of &quot;Prime Minister&quot; (&quot;Prvi Ministar&quot;). In Croatian, the shorter term (Premier) is commonly used as well.

==History==
===Background===

The Royal Government of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (1868–1918) was headed by the Ban of Croatia (Viceroy), who represented the King.

The first head of government of Croatia as a constituent republic of Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was Vladimir Bakarić, who assumed the position on 14 April 1945. The position was then the most powerful public office in the state in addition to the position of the Secretary of the League of Communists of Croatia, as a single-party system was in place. The head of government was renamed to the President of the Executive Council in 1952. Notably, Savka Dabčević-Kučar was the first woman (not only in Croatia, but in Europe) to hold an office equivalent to a head of government as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (1967–1969).

===Transition to independence===
After the constitutional amendments that allowed for multi-party elections in Croatia in 1990, the country was still a constituent republic of SFR Yugoslavia, the position of the President of the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Croatia was filled by Stjepan Mesić on 30 May 1990 (the 14th Executive Council).

The newly-elected Croatian Parliament enacted numerous amendments to the constitution on 25 July 1990. It eliminated socialist references and adopted new national symbols, while the Government of the Republic of Croatia was formally instituted by Amendment LXXIII.

The Constitution of Croatia was subsequently also changed significantly on 22 December 1990, as the so-called &quot;Christmas Constitution&quot; fundamentally defined the Republic of Croatia and its governmental structure. From this point onwards, Croatia was a semi-presidential republic, which meant the president of Croatia had broad executive powers (further expanded with laws to a point of superpresidentialism), including the appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other officials in the government.

Following the May 1991 independence referendum in which 93% of voters approved secession, Croatia formally proclaimed independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, with Josip Manolić continuing in the role of prime minister as head of government of an independent Croatia. However, the country then signed the July 1991 Brijuni Agreement in which it agreed to postpone further activities towards severing ties with Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, the Croatian War of Independence ensued, and Franjo Gregurić was appointed to lead a Government of National Unity. In October the same year, Croatia formally severed all remaining legal ties with the Yugoslav Federation.

===Since independence===
During the period between 1990 and the next constitutional amendments in late 2000, Croatia had seven prime ministers.

Following the January 2000 general election the winning centre-left coalition led by the Social Democratic Party amended the Constitution and effectively stripped the President of most of his executive powers, strengthening the role of the Parliament and the prime minister, turning Croatia into a parliamentary republic. The prime minister again (as before 1990) became the foremost post in Croatian politics.

 there have been twelve Prime Ministers who have chaired 14 governments since the first multi-party elections. Nine prime ministers were members of the Croatian Democratic Union during their terms of office, two were members of the Social Democratic Party and one was not a member of any political party. Since independence there has been one female prime minister (Jadranka Kosor).

==List of prime ministers==

Croatia formally declared itself independent on 25 June 1991. After the declaration of independence, the position continued to be named the Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia.

; Notes

:1. From 1990 until the constitutional changes enacted in 2000, which replaced a powerful semi-presidential system (&quot;de facto&quot; a superpresidential system) with an incomplete parliamentary system, the term of the Prime Minister legally began on the date on which he was appointed by the President of the Republic and not on the date when he received a vote of confidence in Parliament, as is the case since 2000.
:2. Until 12 October 2010.

<text>Spondon is a ward of the city of Derby, in the ceremonial county of Derbyshire, England. Originally a small village, Spondon dates back to the Domesday Book and it became heavily industrialised in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with companies such as British Celanese.

== History ==
The name Spondon is Anglo-Saxon and describes a gravelly hill. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. In about 1333, a great fire, starting at The Malt Shovel, a local pub, and aided by an easterly wind, swept through the village destroying the church and all but a few houses, with just one casualty, the mayor. The damage was so great that a judge, Roger de Bankwell, was sent to hear pleas for relief from taxes. The Great Fire of Spondon is still commemorated and taught as part of the curriculum in local schools. A village fair was held on its 650th anniversary (circa.1990).

Spondon became heavily industrialised in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, with companies such as British Celanese (now Celanese Corporation). The large site is now closed, but it made initially cellulose acetate during World War I and later other artificial fibres.

== Government ==
Spondon is part of the City of Derby and sits in the Mid Derbyshire constituency for Westminster elections.

In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 11,541. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby, Dale Abbey and Ockbrook. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

== Geography ==
The community lies on the north slope of the valley of the River Derwent east of Derby and is divided by the A52, which separates the residential Spondon village area at the top of the hill from the heavily industrialised area at the bottom.

== Demography ==
At the census in 2011 Spondon had a population of 12,377 of which 94.6% were White British, compared to 75.3% for Derby as a whole.

== Economy ==
The industrial belt lies to the south of Nottingham Road/Derby Road (an old Roman road) as does the disused canal and the railway. These barriers separate the residential three-quarters of the village from its industrial quarter. The various industries have included a dye works, electricity generating station, two scrapyards, sewage works, British Celanese synthetic fibres works and a tannery.

Spondon holds a small number of chain shops but continues to support the business of many independent tradespeople too, including a men&#x27;s barbers, a gift shop and a bakery. Chapel Street and Sitwell Street (in the centre) are the main areas of this retail activity.
Dale Road (north-east) and Nottingham Road/Derby Road (south) also have a row of shops.
Superstores (Asda off Derby Road (south-west) are also in Spondon.

== Culture and community ==
There are many clubs, groups and societies serving Spondon. The Spondon Village Festival (Carnival) was first held in 2010 and it was hoped that it would become an annual event combining carnival and fair, but this has fallen through. Spondon won the Urban Community award from Britain in Bloom in 2005.

Facilities include one library, two social clubs, six public houses (the names and numbers have not changed since 1961). The parks are Brunswood (playground and playing field), Dale Road (field and landscaping), South Avenue Rec (playground and field), Gravel Pit Lane (playing field), Locko Park (country park), Spondon Woods (woods and scrub), Stoney Cross (woods and scrub) and Willowcroft (playing field).

The Asterdale Club (formerly the Celanese Workers&#x27; Club) is closed, but the grounds house two football teams and an archery club, club grounds, village parks, the village hall and the old school hall.

== Landmarks ==
The historic centre of the village is designated as a conservation area. Locko Park is a Grade II*-listed mansion dating from 1669. The Homestead is a large detached Georgian mansion on Sitwell Street. The Stone Archways in Park Road mark the entrance to the now demolished Spondon House. The Enoch Stone Memorial marks the spot on Derby Road where a notorious murder took place in 1856 although this is in neighbouring Chaddesden.

== Transport ==
Derby Canal (Derby – Sandiacre) opened in 1795, and enabled other industries. The canal closed in 1964. The Derby &amp; Sandiacre Canal Trust continue in their efforts to reinstate the canal. Borrowash Bottom Lock was repaired in 2018 and Sandiacre Lock has been dug out (Feb 2019). Other sections have been handed over to the Trust and are being cleared of vegetation.(2019) 

The Midland Counties Railway opened a line from Derby to Nottingham in 1839. This line became part of the Midland Main Line to London St Pancras railway station. Spondon railway station has a rather limited service towards both Derby and Nottingham.
The A52, &#x27;Borrowash by-pass&#x27; recently named Brian Clough Way, cuts through the village and provides express road (dual-carriageway) links to the west (Derby) and the east (M1 and Nottingham). Regional Cycle Route 66 links Spondon to Chaddesden and Alvaston.

The Spondon Flyer service provided a non-stop bus link to Derby city centre until its withdrawal in November 2021.

== Education ==
There are five state schools located in the village. 
Primary Schools – Asterdale (south-east), Borrow Wood (north-east), St. Werburgh&#x27;s C of E and Springfield.

Secondary Schools – West Park School.

West Park School represents the merger of the former Spondon School (seniors) (State Comprehensive) which was located on two adjoining sites. These sites being the &#x27;upper school&#x27; (1960s, grey brick, concrete and glass) at the top of the hillside, the current site, and the &#x27;lower school&#x27; (1970s, grey brick, brown tile, timber and glass) at the foot of the hillside, which burned down. The new name comes from the two roads which lead to it.

== Religious sites ==
St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church dates from around 1390, replacing an earlier church destroyed by fire in 1340. In the churchyard is an Anglo-Saxon cross dating from c.870.

As well as St Werburgh&#x27;s, there is the Spondon Methodist Church built in 1934 before the existence of the A52.

<text>Margaret Leng Tan () is a classical music artist known for her work as a professional toy pianist, performing in major cities around the world on her 51 cm-high toy pianos. She is also known to be a classical music performer using unconventional instruments like toy drums, soy sauce dishes, and cat-food cans.

==Early life and education==
Tan was born in Singapore on 12 December 1945, the daughter of former Straits Times Press chairman Tan Chye Cheng, and started taking music lessons at the age of six. In 1961 the young Tan took first place in the Singapore-Malaysia annual piano competition, and won a scholarship to study at The Juilliard School at age 16 in the following year. In 1971 she became the first woman to earn a Doctorate in Musical Arts at Juilliard, and became the diva of the prepared piano, inserting nuts and bolts into the instrument and playing it inside out to rave reviews.

== Musical career ==
In 1981 Tan met John Cage, and since then they continued to work together for the last 11 years of his life. In 1984 she was awarded a US National Endowment for the Arts grant. Between 1990 and 1991 she gave retrospective concerts of Cage&#x27;s music in collaboration with artist Jasper Johns. Since then she has since been hailed as &quot;the leading exponent of Cage&#x27;s music today&quot; (&quot;The New Republic&quot;) and &quot;the most convincing interpreter of John Cage’s keyboard music&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot;). She performed Cage’s music throughout North America, Europe and Asia and in the PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; films on John Cage and Jasper Johns. The association with Cage also led to her enchantment with the toy piano. She made her debut on the instrument in 1993 at New York’s Lincoln Center, playing Cage&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Suite for Toy Piano&quot;. Since finding this first toy piano, she continued to acquire many others, including a 37-key Schoenhut toy grand piano. She continues to, in her own words, &quot;remain wholeheartedly intrigued by the toy piano&#x27;s magical overtones, hypnotic charm, and not least, its off-key poignancy.&quot;

It was in 1993 at a thrift store in the East Village in New York Tan bought her first toy piano which cost a mere US$45. The 45-cm-high, two-octave little toy thus became her instrument to deliver the 1948 &quot;Toy Piano Suite&quot;, and her first love to toy pianos. She recorded her groundbreaking album, &quot;The Art of the Toy Piano&quot;, on Point/Polygram in 1997. In 2002 the pianist performed in Berlin on 9 March, and in New York for a separate celebration of both John Cage and composer Morton Feldman on 13 April. In that same year Tan made history as the first Singapore-born musician to play in the Isaac Stern Auditorium of the Carnegie Hall on 14 April 2002, and performed Cage&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra&quot; with the American Composers Orchestra.

Tan was also featured playing Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot; on her toy piano in the Singapore documentary &quot;Singapore GaGa&quot; by Singaporean film-maker Tan Pin Pin. She is also never far from her toy pianos, and with a fair share of tickling stories on her travels with them. In 2001, when she was invited to perform in an abbey in Provence, France the technical staff advised her to store her toy piano away to prevent bat droppings from landing on her precious piano. In the end her piano was placed under the grand piano; this arrangement of a little piano underneath a big one reminded Tan of &quot;Matroska dolls&quot;. In another occasion, she remembered a funny sight when she carried her piano on board the plane, and had it strapped to a seat next to her.

Evans Chan&#x27;s 2004 documentary, &quot;Sorceress of the New Piano: The Artistry of Margaret Leng Tan&quot;, has been invited to numerous international film festivals including Vancouver, Melbourne and AFI/Discovery Channel&#x27;s SILVERDOCS, where it was nominated for Best Music Documentary. &quot;Sorceress&quot; and Chan&#x27;s &quot;The Maverick Piano&quot;, which features live performances by Tan, are available as a Mode Records DVD.

Tan is the featured performer for &quot;Inside the Piano&quot; on the &quot;Treasures of The New York Public Library&quot; Video Series.

== Awards ==
In 2014, Tan was inducted in the Singapore Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2015, Tan was awarded the Cultural Medallion of Singapore by Tony Tan, President of Singapore.

== Personal life ==
Tan resides in Brooklyn, New York and had collected 18 toy pianos.

Sabi () was the third and final capital of the Korean kingdom of Baekje (), from 538 until Baekje’s fall in 660 CE. The site of Sabi is located in modern-day Buyeo County, South Chungcheong Province, in South Korea.

Sabi Fortress also is known by the names Busosanseong, Sabiseong or Soburiseong Fortress. It consists of the inner fortress divided by roads centered on the royal palace, a defensive fortress called &quot;Buso Mountain Fortress&quot;, and outer walls surrounding the palace. The inner part of the fortress involves 5 district area, where the existence of district was verified through rocks, roof titles, and wooden tablets etched with the name of administrative areas. It is also assumed that the royal palace of Baekje had been located on this site.

== Location ==
The location of Sabi is north of current downtown Buyeo at the southern foot of Busosan Mountain. This location was chosen for its natural fortifications and ease of access to other regions. It was located on a plain on the Geum River, which served as a point of outreach to the southern portion of the Korean peninsula, as well as the Gaya Region. It was located at the foot of mountains, which helped shield it from attacks, though it was surrounded by extensive agricultural lands. The Yellow Sea was nearby as well, which allowed for easy trade with China and Japan.

== History ==
Sabi was the third and final capital of Baekje. The previous capital, Ungjin (KOR: 웅진), was isolated in the mountains, cutting it off from the outside world, making it an unfit location for the capital. King Song, the king of Baekje, moved the capital approximately 30 kilometers southwest to Sabi in 538 CE. Sabi was the capital of the kingdom of Baekje for 120 years until 660 CE, when Baekje fell to an attack from the neighboring kingdom of Silla, combined with forces from Tang Dynasty China. The city officially surrendered on August 24, 660.

During the 120 years, Sabi was under the control of:

* King Song (523-554)
* King Widok (554-598)
* King Hye (598-599)
* King Pop (599-600)
* King Mu (600-641)
* King Uija (641-660)

King Mu attempted to move the capital to Iksan (KOR: 익산) during his reign, but it wasn’t successful.

Sabi Conference(泗沘會議) were held in 541 and 544. See also Anra Conference(安羅會議) in 529

In 541, 1st Sabi Conference be held, Baekje, Anra (安羅), Daegaya, Zolma (卒麻), Sanbanhae (散半奚), Dara (多羅), Sagi (斯二岐), Jata (子他), and Anra-wa envoy office () gather.
At this meeting, Gaya asked Baekje if they could defend against Silla&#x27;s attacks. Then, Baekje said Takgitan, Taksun, and Geumgwan Gaya were all ruined by weakness own and promised to defend themselves.
In fact, Baekje could not make a strong promise because Baekje needed Silla&#x27;s help to regain the Han River basin.
In July, Anra felt uneasy and contacted Silla through the Anra-wa envoy office(安羅日本府). After noticing this, Baekje(King Seong) called Imna and scolded.
Then, emphasizes the history of King Geunchogo&#x27;s reign and promise that the three countries that have been destroyed will be restored and returned to the Gaya.
In July 542, Beakje declared Gaya Confederacy revival, but this was a just none-action declaration.
Anra, who has a resistance, is engaged in diplomacy.
In November 543, the Japan declared that it would send out Baekje&#x27;s generals and castellan within the Imna and Gaya Confederacy through the Anra-wa envoy office(安羅倭臣官).
In December 543, King Seong held a Jeongsa Rock Council() to resolve Gaya&#x27;s rebellion, and the conclusion was to hold 2nd Sabi Conference.
Baekje convened a Conference in December 543, but the Gaya Confederacy continued to make excuses, and Baekje, which was angry in February 544, called in the &quot;Anra-wa envoy office&quot; official to insult and send him back to the Japanese state.
The Japan announced that it was willing to participate in the Sabi conference, but the Gaya Confederacy did not continue to attend in March.
Eventually, in October 544, the envoy of Baekje returned from Japan and promised to grant Gaya the request as much as possible.
In 544 November, 2nd Sabi Conference be held, and eight countries, including Baekje and the Gucha(久嵯國) gather.
In order to protect the Gaya Confederacy, King Seong of Baekje said at the meeting, &quot;We will build six castles on the Nakdong River, the border area between Silla and Anra, and instead of stationed 3,000 Japanese soldiers and Baekje troops, Baekje will pay for it.&quot;
&quot;The reason why Baekje cannot send out its generals and castellan is not to prevent exchanges between Gaya and Japan. In preparation for the attack of Goguryeo and Silla, it is inevitable to send them out.&#x27; made an excuse.
It also calls for all the Gaya Japanese in the &quot;Anra-wa envoy office(安羅倭臣官)&quot; to be sent to Japan. The Gaya Confederacy disband after saying it think deeply about the proposal.
In March and May of 545, Japan and Baekje exchanged envoys. They exchanged again in January, June and July 546. In April 547 Baekje requested Silla, Gaya, and japan to serve as soldiers.
In January 548, the Goguryeo-Ye Alliance attacked, but Silla supported 3,000 soldiers and eventually managed to stop them. called Battle of Mt.Doksseong Castle()(548).
However, after Baekje fought with Goguryeo, they took prisoners and questioned them, and they said, &quot;Anra and wa envoy office(倭臣官) recommended the conquest of Baekje to Goguryeo.&#x27; gets information.
Baekje sent envoys to Anra three times to confirm the facts, but all of them were rejected. In April 548 Baekje sent envoys to the Japanese government to interrogate them. The Japanese government did not know about it, but Baekje did not believe it and canceled its military request.
King Seong led the armies of Silla and Imna as well as the Baekje army, starting the Han River Restoration War()(551~553). Through this, Baekje recovers the Han River but is betrayed by Silla in Battle of Gwansan Castle()(554). Then, it ends with Fall of Gaya(562)
== Features ==
The city was surrounded by a two-layered defense. The outer layer was the Busosan Fortress, that guarded the capital from the side that the nearby mountains left open. The inner layer was The Naseong (KOR: 나성) City Wall which encircled the entire capital. The original appearance of both layers are still intact.

The city was divided into 5 administrative districts called bu (KOR: 부), those were divided into 5 smaller districts called hang (KOR: 항).

The royal palace and its surrounding facilities were located directly at the southern foot of Busosan Mountain. There was a man made pond located south of the palace. It was completed in 634, under the orders of King Mu.

Excavation since the 1980s has uncovered the building site of the royal palace, including water supply facilities, storage facilities, a lotus pond. The site of the Jeongnimsa (KOR: 정림사) Temple, which was built in the center of the city, was also discovered, as well as royal tombs just outside the eastern part of the Naseong City Wall. These archeological sites were added to UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015.

=== Royal Palace ===
The royal palace and its surrounding facilities are located at the northernmost end of the city. There, a large building site was discovered. The site spans 35m across and 18.5m in length, which is evident from the 50 cm tall remains of the platform that once supported the building. Within the site 36 rammed-earth foundations were discovered, which are believed to have supported the pillars and cornerstones of the building.

The site was confirmed to be the royal palace due to three different types of evidence. The first being a gilt-bronze waist belt was found at the site. The belt could have only belonged to a king due to the strict hierarchy of Baekje society at the time. This discovery indicated that the area was once the residence of a king. Roof tiles with inscriptions of the royal court, large stone structures, and a monument to Liu Renyuan of Tang China, were found at the site. These point to the importance of the location, which point to it being the location of the royal palace. The site was also used for local government offices in later Korean dynasties.

Two large, wooden water tanks, five underground, wooden storage facilities, three stone storage facilities, and various other storage pits were also found at the location. A man-made lotus pond that was 10.6m in width, 6.2m in length, and ranged from 1 to 1.2m in depth, was found as well.
=== Busosanseong ===

The fortress was built to protect the city from the sides that weren&#x27;t naturally protected by the surrounding mountains and river. It was built using a rammed-earth technique and had a perimeter of 2,495m, was 5 to 6m wide at the base, and was 3m high. Building sites, including a barracks for Baekje soldiers, as well as Gate Sites have been found within the fortress. Two Gate Sites have been identified, the first, which was the main gate, was on the south side of the fortress, while the second one was on the east side.
=== Jeongnimsa ===

The temple was located at the center of Sabi and is still located at the center of modern-day Buyeo. The temple included a central gate, a prayer hall, a lecture hall, and monks’ dormitories that were connected to the main buildings by linking corridors. The layout is believed to either have been “one pagoda and one prayer hall” or “one pagoda and two prayer halls.”

The only thing still remaining of the temple is an 8.3m tall stone pagoda. The pagoda has Chinese characters carved into the surface of it. The writing is celebrating the Tang Dynasty’s victory over the Kingdom of Baekje and was put there by the commanding Tang general, Liu Renyuan.

=== Royal Tombs ===

Outside the eastern part of the city wall, 7 tombs are located. The tombs are within mounds of hollowed earth and can be seen as semi-spheres on the hillside. They are arranged in two rows of three mounds, while one mound is located 50m to the north.

The tombs are classified as stone chambers with a corridor and are divided into types based on what type of ceiling they have. The royal tombs of Sabi have three different types present: vault ceiling, hexagonal flat ceiling, and square flat ceiling.

<doc id="327767" wikidata="Q1131648" url="?curid=327767" title="Life on the Mississippi">
<text>Life on the Mississippi is a memoir by Mark Twain of his days as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River before the American Civil War published in 1883. It is also a travel book, recounting his trips on the Mississippi River, from St. Louis to New Orleans and then from New Orleans to Saint Paul, many years after the war.

==Overview==
The book begins with a brief history of the river as reported by Europeans and Americans, beginning with the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1542. It continues with anecdotes of Twain&#x27;s training as a steamboat pilot, as the &#x27;cub&#x27; (apprentice) of an experienced pilot, Horace E. Bixby. He describes, with great affection, the science of navigating the ever-changing Mississippi River in a section that was first published in 1876, entitled &quot;Old Times on the Mississippi&quot;. Although Twain was actually 21 when he began his training, he uses artistic license to make himself seem somewhat younger, referring to himself as a &quot;fledgling&quot; and a &quot;boy&quot; who &quot;ran away from home&quot; to seek his fortune on the river, and playing up his own callowness and naïveté.

In the second half, Twain narrates his trip many years later on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, shortly followed by a steamboat journey from New Orleans to St Paul (with a stop at his boyhood home town of Hannibal, MO). He describes the competition from railroads, and the new, large cities, and adds his observations on greed, gullibility, tragedy, and bad architecture. He also tells some stories that are most likely tall tales.

==Publication==
Simultaneously published in 1883 in the United States and Great Britain, the book was the first submitted to a publisher as a typewritten manuscript. Twain did not, however, use the typewriter himself. His secretary, Isabel V. Lyon, typed from Twain&#x27;s manuscript.

==Dramatic adaptations==

In 1980, the book was adapted as a TV movie for American public television, with David Knell performing as Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain&#x27;s real name) and Robert Lansing as Horace Bixby, the steamboat pilot who mentored him. The film used many tall tales from the book, woven into a fictional narrative. 

In 2010, &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; was adapted as a stage musical, with book and lyrics by Douglas M. Parker and music by Denver Casado. It was produced that year in Kansas City, Missouri, and Door County, Wisconsin.

In 2013, &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, a musical play by Philip Hall, was performed at the Workshop Theater Company in New York. It was directed by Susanna Frazer.

<text>Harper&#x27;s Bazaar is an American monthly women&#x27;s fashion magazine. It was first published in New York City on November 2, 1867, as the weekly Harper&#x27;s Bazar. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; is published by Hearst and considers itself to be the style resource for &quot;women who are the first to buy the best, from casual to couture&quot;. Since its debut in 1867, as the U.S.&#x27;s first fashion magazine, its pages have been home to talent such as the founding editor, author and translator Mary Louise Booth, as well as numerous fashion editors, photographers, illustrators and writers. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; targets an audience of professional women ranging from their twenties to sixties, who are interested in culture, travel, and luxury experiences.

The name change to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; was filed on December 30, 1930. However, the first magazine that showed the spelling &quot;bazaar&quot; on the cover came earlier with the November 1929 issue.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;″s corporate offices are located in the Hearst Tower, 300 West 57th Street or 959 Eighth Avenue, near Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

The current editor-in-chief of the U.S. edition is Samira Nasr.

==History==
Book publishers Harper &amp; Brothers founded the magazine based in New York City on November 2, 1867. This company also gave birth to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazar&quot; began publication as a tabloid-size weekly newspaper catering to women in the middle and upper classes. It showcased fashion from Germany and Paris in a newspaper-design format. In fact, it was directly inspired by and modeled on a German fashion magazine &quot;Der Bazar&quot;, and received content from the German magazine in its early years, often publishing it simultaneously. It was not until 1901 &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; moved to a monthly issued magazine which it maintains today. Now &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; is owned and operated by Hearst in the United States and the National Magazine Company in the United Kingdom. Hearst purchased the magazine in 1913.

As the turn of the century began in America, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazar&quot; began featuring both illustrations and photographs for its covers and inside features of high society and increasingly of fashion.

During the late Victorian period, as the women&#x27;s suffrage movement was gaining momentum (American women did not all win the right to vote until 1920 with the passing of the 19th Amendment), the introduction of more tailored dresses and jackets coincided with women&#x27;s new sense of feminism. &quot;Bazaar&quot; also began profiling prominent socialites, such as the Astors and the Griscoms. In its early years, Harper&#x27;s Bazaar focused primarily on society news, women&#x27;s issues, and literature. The magazine featured articles, short stories, and serialized novels by notable authors such as Henry James, Edith Wharton, and Virginia Woolf.

In 1933, editor-in-chief Carmel Snow (a former editor at &quot;Vogue&quot;) brought photojournalist Martin Munkacsi to a windswept beach to shoot a swimwear spread. As the model ran toward the camera, Munkacsi took the picture that made fashion-magazine history. Until that moment, nearly all fashion was carefully staged on mannequin-like models in a studio. Snow&#x27;s buoyant spirit (she rarely slept or ate, although she had a lifelong love affair with the three-martini lunch) and wicked sense of adventure brought life to the pages of &quot;Bazaar&quot;. Snow&#x27;s genius came from cultivating the &quot;best&quot; people. Her first big find was art director Alexey Brodovitch, who innovated &quot;Bazaar&quot;″s iconic Didot logo. Brodovitch is perhaps best known for his work with Richard Avedon, who, as a young photographer, was so determined to work at &quot;Bazaar&quot; that he endured the humiliation of 14 canceled interviews before finally being hired. Snow also unleashed the force of nature known as Diana Vreeland, whom she brought on as fashion editor in 1936. The collaboration of these four visionaries resulted in some of the germane fashion shoots of the 20th century and ended only with Snow&#x27;s retirement, at age 70, in 1957. The publication in the September 15, 1937 issue of Man Ray&#x27;s photograph of his partner, the Guadeloupean model and dancer Adrienne Fidelin, was the first time a Black model was featured in a major American fashion magazine. Carmel Snow was living in Ireland before her mother, Annie White paid for her and her sisters immigration to America when she was 8-years-old.

In 1934, newly installed &quot;Bazaar&quot; editor Carmel Snow attended an Art Directors Club of New York exhibition curated by 36-year-old graphic designer Alexey Brodovitch and immediately offered Brodovitch a job as &quot;Bazaar&quot;″s art director. Throughout his career at the magazine, Brodovitch, a Russian émigré (by way of Paris), revolutionized magazine design. With his directive &quot;Astonish me&quot;, he inspired some of the greatest visual artists of the 20th century (including protégés Irving Penn, Hiro, Gleb Derujinsky, and, of course, Richard Avedon). One of his assistants was future &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; art director Tony Lane. Brodovitch&#x27;s signature use of white space, his innovation of &quot;Bazaar&quot;″s iconic Didot logo, and the cinematic quality that his obsessive cropping brought to layouts (not even the work of Man Ray and Henri Cartier-Bresson was safe from his busy scissors) compelled Truman Capote to write, &quot;What Dom Pérignon was to champagne ... so [Brodovitch] has been to ... photographic design and editorial layout.&quot; Brodovitch&#x27;s personal life was less triumphant. Plagued by alcoholism, he left &quot;Bazaar&quot; in 1958 and eventually moved to the south of France, where he died in 1971.
When Carmel Snow saw Diana Vreeland dancing on the roof of New York&#x27;s St. Regis Hotel in a white lace Chanel dress and a bolero with roses in her hair one evening in 1936, she knew she&#x27;d found &quot;Bazaar&quot;″s newest staffer. Diana, who is said to have invented the word &quot;pizzazz&quot;, first came to the attention of readers with her &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You ...?&quot; column. (A typical suggestion: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you ... wear, like the Duchess of Kent, three enormous diamond stars arranged in your hair in front?&quot;) Before long, she became fashion editor, collaborating with photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Alexey Brodovitch, and Richard Avedon and, later, art director Henry Wolf. Her eccentricity, perception and wit, as well as her sharp wit and sweeping pronouncements (&quot;I adore that pink! It&#x27;s the navy blue of India,&quot; &quot;Elegance is refusal!&quot;), were memorialized in the movie &quot;Funny Face&quot;, making her, for many, the prototypical fashion-magazine editor.

Richard Avedon began creating fashion portfolios for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; at age 22. His distinctive photographs showed both chic insouciance and boundless vitality. Avedon&#x27;s women leapt off curbs, roller-skated on the Place de la Concorde, and were seen in nightclubs, enjoying the freedom and fashions of the postwar era. He wanted his art in photos to be in the moment for his models, to be much more natural and raw. The goal always for him was to eliminate the background and pull focus to the main subject of the photograph, such as a model in the desert suffering from being stranded in the middle of nowhere. His minimalist style of photography created this new theme in fashion where less can be more. Amazingly, he carved a pathway for models to show their true selves in modeling. 

He was immortalized in the film &quot;Funny Face&quot; by the character Dick Avery (played by Fred Astaire), who asked, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with bringing out a girl who has character, spirit, and intelligence?&quot; Alongside Fred Astaire was the leading lady Audrey Hepburn who portrays a &quot;plain&quot; girl who ultimately blossoms into a beautiful women. Avedon contributed many stills of Audrey Hepburn to the film, although he did not believe it truly captured her beauty, because getting to know her set her beauty on whole another level that just could not be caught in a photo.

Being photographed by Avedon for the February 1959 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, China Machado was one of the first non-caucasian models to appear on the pages of a fashion magazine.

Gleb Derujinsky&#x27;s 18-year career at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; spanned from 1950 to 1968 and during that time produced some of the classic images of the era.
Scouted by editor-in-chief Carmel Snow and art director Alexey Brodovitch, Derujinsky joined the elite group of photographers, including Richard Avedon, who shot for the magazine. Working closely with the then fashion editor Diana Vreeland, Derujinsky proved a pioneer in his field, creating stunning juxtapositions between European Haute Couture dresses and landscapes ranging from desert sands to car junkyards, fairgrounds and airports, all this at a time when air travel was yet to become as common as it is now. &quot;Avedon shot dresses and clothes, Gleb shot women living in them&quot;.

To mark the inauguration of Pan Am&#x27;s Boeing 707 in 1957, Derujinsky traveled across the world with Nena von Schlebrügge, and Ruth Neumann, whom he would later marry. The latter would be his muse from the seaside harbors of China, to the Nara Deer Park in Japan, and throughout Thailand, Spain and Greece.
The 1957 Paris Collections were the basis for a 25-page spread in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; featuring his photographs. &quot;Gleb Derujinsky&#x27;s photographs evoke the best of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;: exquisitely beautiful, original, and instantly iconic images of a very fashionable life&quot;.

Nonnie Moore was hired as fashion editor in 1980, having served in the same post at &quot;Mademoiselle.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noticed the changes she made at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, highlighting how the magazine had been &quot;looking a little dowdy&quot;, but that Moore had &quot;noticeably sharpened the magazine&#x27;s fashion point of view&quot; by showing &quot;brighter, younger and more stylish&quot;, complimenting her use of &quot;young and exciting fashion photographers&quot;, such as Oliviero Toscani.

<text>The Ophites, also called Ophians (Greek Ὀφιανοί &quot;Ophianoi&quot;, from ὄφις &quot;ophis&quot; &quot;snake&quot;), were a Christian Gnostic sect depicted by Hippolytus of Rome (170–235) in a lost work, the &quot;Syntagma&quot; (&quot;arrangement&quot;).

It is now thought that later accounts of these &quot;Ophites&quot; by Pseudo-Tertullian, Philastrius and Epiphanius of Salamis are all dependent on the lost &quot;Syntagma&quot; of Hippolytus. It is possible that, rather than an actual sectarian name, Hippolytus may have invented &quot;Ophite&quot; as a generic term for what he considered heretical speculations concerning the serpent of Genesis or Moses.

Apart from the sources directly dependent on Hippolytus (Pseudo-Tertullian, Philastrius and Epiphanius), Origen and Clement of Alexandria also mention the group. The group is mentioned by Irenaeus in &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot; (1:30).

==Pseudo-Tertullian==

Pseudo-Tertullian (probably the Latin translation of Hippolytus&#x27;s lost &quot;Syntagma&quot;, written c. 220) is the earliest source to mention Ophites, and the first source to discuss the connection with serpents. He claims (&quot;Haer&quot;. 2.1-4) that the Ophites taught that

The name &quot;Jesus&quot; is not mentioned in the account. Epiphanius&#x27;s account differs from that of Pseudo-Tertullian only in a few places. According to the former, the Ophites did not actually prefer the snake to Christ, but thought them identical (&quot;Pan&quot;. 37.1.2; 2.6; 6.5-6; 8.1).

==Hippolytus==
===&quot;Syntagma&quot;===
This lost earlier treatise of Hippolytus appears to have contained a section on the Ophites, following that on the Nicolaitans, with whom they were brought into connection. Philaster has mistakenly (obviously) transposed this and two other sections, beginning his treatise on heresies with the Ophites, and making the Ophites, Cainites, and Sethians pre-Christian sects. The section of Hippolytus appears to have given a condensed account of the mythological story told by Irenaeus. In giving the name Ophite, however, he appears to have brought into greater prominence than Irenaeus the characteristics of the sect indicated by the word, their honour of the serpent, whom they even preferred to Christ, their venerating him because he taught our first parents the knowledge of good and evil, their use of the references to the brazen serpent in the Old and New Testament, and their introduction of the serpent into their Eucharistic celebration.

===&quot;Philosophumena&quot;===

The great difference between the earlier and the later treatise of Hippolytus is that the former was a mere compilation, his account of the opinions of heresies being in the main derived from the lectures of Irenaeus; but at the time of writing the latter, he had himself read several heretical writings, of which he gives an extract in his treatise. In this book he makes a contemptuous mention of the Ophites in company with the Cainites and Nochaitae (8:20) as heretics whose doctrines did not deserve the compliment of serious exposition or refutation.

And it is strange that he does not seem to suspect that these heretics have any connection with those who form the subject of his fifth book. In that book he treats of sects which paid honour to the serpent, giving to the first of these sects the name Naassenes, a title which he knows is derived from the Hebrew word for serpent (&quot;Nahash&quot;-נחש). Possibly Hippolytus restricted the name Ophites to the sect described by Irenaeus, which has very little in common with that which he calls Naassenes. This book contains sections on several other Ophite systems, that of the Peratae, Sethians and of Justinus.

==Irenaeus==
===&quot;Against Heresies&quot;===
Irenaeus (died c. 202) gives, in what seems intended for chronological order, a list of heresies, beginning with Simon Magus and ending with Tatian, and adds in a kind of appendix a description of a variety of Gnostic sects deriving their origin, as Irenaeus maintains, from the heresy of Simon Magus (&quot;Against Heresies&quot; 1:23-28). This chronology is not considered historically accurate by most modern authors.

He details what has been identified by subsequent writers as an Ophite cosmogony. Creation began as a series of emanations:

The True and Holy Church:
*&quot;Bythos&quot; (Depth):
**Father of All (the First Man):
***&quot;Ennoia&quot;, the Son of Man (the Second Man):
****The Holy Spirit, the First Woman:
*****Water
*****Darkness
*****The Abyss
*****Chaos

Of the beauty of the Holy Spirit, both First and Second Man became enamoured, and they generated from her a third male, an Incorruptible Light, called Christ.

===Sophia===
But the excess of light with which she had been impregnated was more than she could contain, and while Christ her right-hand birth was borne upward with his mother, forming with the First and Second Man the True and Holy Church, a drop of light fell on the left hand downwards into the world of matter, and was called Sophia (Wisdom) or Prunikos, an androgynous being.

By this arrival the still waters were set in motion, all things rushing to embrace the Light, and Prunikos wantonly playing with the waters, assumed to herself a body, without the protection of which the light was in danger of being completely absorbed by matter. Yet when oppressed by the grossness of her surroundings, she strove to escape the waters and ascend to her mother, the body weighed her down, and she could do no more than arch herself above the waters, constituting thus the visible heaven. In process of time, however, by intensity of desire she was able to free herself from the encumbrance of the body, and leaving it behind to ascend to the region immediately above, called in the language of another sect the middle region.

===Ialdabaoth===
Meanwhile a son, Ialdabaoth, born to her from her contact with the waters, having in him a certain breath of the incorruptible light left him from his mother, by means of which he works, generates from the waters a son without any mother. And this son in like manner another, until there were seven Archons in all, ruling the seven heavens; a Hebdomad which their mother completes into an Ogdoad.

*Ialdabaoth (possibly from Hebrew &quot;yalda bahut&quot; &#x27;son of chaos&#x27;), the Demiurge
*Iao
*Sabaoth
*Adonaios
*Elaios
*Astaphanos
*Horaios (from Hebrew &quot;or&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;)

But it came to pass that these sons strove for mastery with their father Ialdabaoth, whereat he suffered great affliction, and casting his despairing gaze on the dregs of matter below, he, through them, consolidated his longing and obtained a son Ophiomorphus, the serpent-formed Nous, whence come the spirit and soul, and all things of this lower world; but whence came also oblivion, wickedness, jealousy, envy, and death. Ialdabaoth, stretching himself over his upper heaven, had shut out from all below the knowledge that there was anything higher than himself, and having puffed up with pride at the sons whom he had begotten without help from his mother, he cried,

On this his mother, hearing him, cried out (),

When the heavenly powers marvelled at this voice, Ialdabaoth, to call off their attention, exclaimed, &quot;Let us make man after our image.&quot; Then the six powers formed a gigantic man, the mother Sophia having given assistance to the design, in order that by this means she might recover the Light-fluid from Ialdabaoth. For the man whom the six powers had formed, lay unable to raise itself, writhing like a worm until they brought it to their father, who breathed into it the breath of life, and so emptied himself of his power. But the man having now Thought and Conception (Nous and Enthymesis), forthwith gave thanks to the First Man, disregarding those who had made him.

At this Ialdabaoth, being jealous, planned to despoil the man by means of a woman, and formed Eve, of whose beauty the six powers being enamoured generated sons from her, namely, the angels. Then Sophia devised by means of the serpent to seduce Eve and Adam to transgress the precept of Ialdabaoth; and Eve, accepting the advice of one who seemed a Son of God, persuaded Adam also to eat of the forbidden tree. And when they ate they gained knowledge of the power which is over all, and revoked from those who had made them. Thereupon Ialdabaoth cast Adam and Eve out of Paradise; but the mother had secretly emptied them of the Light-fluid in order that it might not share the curse or reproach. So they were cast down into this world, as was also the serpent who had been detected in working against his father. He brought the angels here under his power, and himself generated six sons, a counterpart of the Hebdomad of which his father was a member. These seven demons always oppose and thwart the human race on whose account their father was cast down.

Adam and Eve at first had light and clear and, as it were, spiritual bodies, which on their fall became dull and gross; and their spirits were also languid because they had lost all but the breath of this lower world which their maker had breathed into them; until Prunikos taking pity on them gave them back the sweet odour of the Light-fluid through which they woke to a knowledge of themselves and knew that they were naked.

The above is clearly a variant of the account of the Creation given in chapter 1 of The Book of Genesis – but with the major difference that the single, omnipotent God of the original Biblical story is here depicted as Ialdabaoth – one of many Divine beings, and not the most important of them, with his claim to exclusive Godhood described as an arrogant and false usurpation.

The story proceeds to give a version of Old Testament history, in which Ialdabaoth is represented as making a series of efforts to obtain exclusive adoration for himself, and to avenge himself on those who refused to pay it, while he is counteracted by Prunikos, who strives to enlighten mankind as to the existence of higher powers more deserving of adoration. In particular the prophets who were each the organ of one of the Hebdomad, the glorification of whom was their main theme, were nevertheless inspired by Sophia to make fragmentary revelations about the First Man and about Christ above, whose descent also she caused to be predicted.

===Redemption===
And here we come to the version given of New Testament history in this system. Sophia, having no rest either in heaven or on earth, implored the assistance of her mother, the First Woman. She, moved with pity at her daughter&#x27;s repentance, begged of the First Man that Christ should be sent down to her assistance. Sophia, apprized of the coming help, announced his advent by John, prepared the baptism of repentance, and by means of her son, Ialdabaoth, got ready a woman to receive the annunciation from Christ, in order that when he came there might be a pure and clean vessel to receive him, namely Jesus, who, being born of a virgin by divine power, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than any other man. Christ then descended through the seven heavens, taking the form of the sons of each as he came down, and depriving each of their rulers of his power. For wheresoever Christ came the Light-fluid rushed to him, and when he came into this world he first united himself with his sister Sophia, and they refreshed one another as bridegroom and bride, and the two united descended into Jesus (though never actually dwelling in his flesh), who thus became Jesus Christ. Then he began to work miracles, and to announce the unknown Father, and to declare himself manifestly the son of the First Man. Then Ialdabaoth and the other princes of the Hebdomad, being angry, sought to have Jesus crucified, but Christ and Sophia did not share his passion, having withdrawn themselves into the incorruptible Aeon. But Christ did not forget Jesus, but sent a power which raised his body up, not indeed his choical body, for &quot;flesh and blood cannot lay hold of the kingdom of God,&quot; but his animal and spiritual body. So it was that Jesus did no miracles, either before his baptism, when he was first united to Christ, or after his resurrection, when Christ had withdrawn himself from him. Jesus then remained on earth after his resurrection eighteen months, at first himself not understanding the whole truth, but enlightened by a revelation subsequently made him, which he taught to a chosen few of his disciples, and then was taken up to heaven.

The story proceeds to tell that Christ, sitting on the right hand of the father Ialdabaoth, without his knowledge enriches himself with the souls of those who had known him, inflicting a corresponding loss on Ialdabaoth. For as righteous souls instead of returning to him are united to Christ, Ialdabaoth is less and less able to bestow any of the Light-fluid on souls afterwards entering this world, and can only breathe into them his own animal breath. The consummation of all things will take place when, by successive union of righteous souls with Christ, the last drop of the Light-fluid shall be recovered from this lower world.

===Significance===
The system here expounded evidently implies a considerable knowledge of the Old Testament on the part either of its inventor or expounder. It begins with &quot;the spirit of God moving on the face of the waters,&quot; and it summarises the subsequent history, even mentioning the sacred writers by name. Yet that it is not the work of those amicable to Judaism is evident from the hostility shown to the God of the Jews, who is represented as a mixture of arrogance and ignorance, waging war against idolatry from mere love of self-exaltation, yet constantly thwarted and overcome by the skill of superior knowledge. The feminine attributes ascribed to the Holy Spirit indicate that Greek was not the native language of the framer of this system, and this conclusion is confirmed by the absence of elements derived from Greek philosophic systems. If, for instance, we compare this system with that of Valentinus, we discover at once so much agreement in essential features as to assure us of the substantial identity of the foundation of the two systems; but the Valentinian system contains several things derived from Greek philosophy, whereas that which we have described can be explained from purely Oriental sources. We are entitled therefore to regard the latter as representing the more original form. The reporter of this system is clearly acquainted with the New Testament, since he adopts a phrase from the Epistle to the Corinthians; he knows that Jesus habitually spoke of himself as Son of Man; and in denying that Jesus performed miracles before his baptism, he adopts the history as told in the Gospels in opposition to that told in apocryphal Gospels of the Infancy. The place which the doctrine of a Trinity holds in this system is significant.

Although, following Theodoret, we have given the name Ophite to the system described by Irenaeus, it will have been seen that the doctrine concerning the serpent forms a very subordinate part of the system. In the passage immediately following the chapter we have analysed, Irenaeus shows acquaintance with a section of the school who may be called Ophite in the proper sense of the word, some teaching that Sophia herself was the serpent, some glorifying Cain and other enemies of the God of the Old Testament.

If we were to single out what we regard as the most characteristic feature of the scheme, it is the prominence given to the attribute of light as the property of the good Principle. This feature is still more striking in the derived system of &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, where the mention of light is of perpetual occurrence, and the dignity of every being is measured by the brilliancy of its light.

In the section of Irenaeus immediately preceding that of which we have just given an account, there is a summary of a system which has been called Barbeliot, from its use of the name Barbelo to denote the supreme female principle. It contains some of the essential features of the scheme just described, of which it seems to have been a development, principally characterized by a great wealth of nomenclature, and, with the exception of the name which has given a title to the system, all derived from the Greek language.

==Clement of Alexandria==
Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215) incidentally mentions Cainites and Ophites, (&quot;Stromata&quot; 7:17) but gives no explanation of their tenets. Nor do we suppose that there is any reason to connect with this sect his reprobation of the use of serpent ornaments by women (&quot;Instructor&quot; 2:13).

==Origen==

Origen (c. 185–254) is led to speak of the Ophites () by an accusation of Celsus that the Christians counted seven heavens, and spoke of the Creator as an accursed divinity, inasmuch as he was worthy of execration for cursing the serpent who introduced the first human beings to the knowledge of good and evil. Origen replies that Celsus had mixed up matters, and had confounded the Christians with the Ophites, who so far from being Christians would not hear the name of Jesus, nor own him to have been so much as a wise and virtuous man, nor would admit anyone into their assembly until he had cursed Jesus. It may be doubted whether Origen has not here been misinformed about a sect of which he intimates that he knows but little. According to all other authorities the Ophites claimed to be Christians. Elsewhere Origen classes the Ophites as heretics of the graver sort with the followers of Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides, and Apelles (&quot;Commentary on Matthew&quot; 3:852). The identity of the nomenclature shows that for Origen, these Ophites of Origen are a branch of the unnamed sect described by Irenaeus.

===Hebdomad===
The names of the seven princes of the Hebdomad, as given by Origen, agree completely with the list of Irenaeus (). Origen also gives the names of the seven demons. Irenaeus only gives the name of their chief, but that one is enough to establish a more than accidental coincidence, since it is a name we should not have expected to find as the name of a demon, namely, Michael. The name Prunikos is also found in the report of Origen. Origen gives what must have been one of the valuable secrets of this sect, viz. the formula to be addressed by an ascending soul to each of the princes of the hebdomad in order to propitiate him to grant a passage through his dominions. Perhaps the secret would have been more jealously guarded if it were not that in addition to the use of the formula, it seems to have been necessary to produce at each gate a certain symbol. These would only be in the possession of the initiated, and we may imagine that they were buried with them. He gives the formulae in the inverse order; i.e. first the formula to be used by a soul which has passed through the highest heaven and desires to enter the Ogdoad; next the formula to be used in order to gain admission to the highest heaven, and so on.

===Diagrams===

Origen also gives a description of an Ophite diagram, which Celsus likewise had met with, consisting of an outer circle, named Leviathan, denoting the soul of all things, with ten internal circles, variously coloured, the diagram containing also the figures and names of the seven demons. Many have attempted to reproduce the figure from Origen&#x27;s description, but in truth Origen has not given us particulars enough to enable us to make a restoration with confidence, or even to enable us to understand what was intended to be represented. Origen names Euphrates as the introducer of the doctrine of the sect which he describes, and the sect may have been that branch of the Ophites who are called Peratae.

==Epiphanius==
Ophite teaching was, most likely, dying out in the days of Hippolytus; in the time of Epiphanius it was not absolutely extinct, but the notices in his work would lead us to think of it as but the eccentric doctrine of some stray heretic here and there, and not to have counted many adherents. In the 5th century Theodoret tells (&quot;Heresies&quot; 1:24) of having found serpent worship practised in his diocese by people whom he calls Marcionites, but whom we may believe to have been really Ophites.

==Nag Hammadi texts==
Of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts that mention the serpent, three appear related to early church accounts of the Ophites. These texts are &quot;Hypostasis of the Archons, On the Origin of the World,&quot; and the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;.

==Modern emulation==
Our Lady of Endor Coven, a cult established in 1948, was strongly influenced by the teachings of the ancient Ophites, as given in the above sources.

<text>William Gannaway &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow (August 29, 1805April 29, 1877) was an American newspaper publisher, Methodist minister, book author, prisoner of war, lecturer, and politician who served as the 17th governor of Tennessee from 1865 to 1869 and as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1869 to 1875. Brownlow rose to prominence in the late 1830s and early 1840s as editor of the &quot;Whig&quot;, a polemical newspaper in East Tennessee that promoted Henry Clay and the Whig Party ideals, and also that repeated Brownlow&#x27;s opposition to secession by the southern slave states in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Brownlow&#x27;s uncompromising and radical viewpoints made him one of the most divisive figures in Tennessee political history and one of the most controversial Reconstruction Era politicians of the United States.

Beginning his career as a Methodist circuit rider in the 1820s, Brownlow was both censured and praised by his superiors for his vicious verbal debates responding to rival missionaries of other sectarian Christian beliefs. Later, as a newspaper publisher and editor, he was notorious for his relentless replies in the form of personal attacks against his religious and political opponents, sometimes to the point of being physically assaulted. At the same time, Brownlow was successfully building a large base of fiercely loyal subscribers.

Brownlow returned to Tennessee in 1863 and in 1865 became governor with support of the U.S. Army behind him. Brownlow aligned with the Radical Republicans in the state, supporting President Lincoln&#x27;s Civil War and Reconstruction era policies and spent much of his term opposing the policies of Conservative Republicans. Brownlow&#x27;s gubernatorial policies, which were both autocratic and progressive, helped Tennessee become the first former Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union in 1866, &quot;exempting it from the lengthy federal military reconstruction inflicted on most of the South&quot;. After the Civil War, Brownlow again resumed his opposition to longtime political foe and then president Andrew Johnson, an often bitter and biting dislike for each other that both Brownlow and Johnson had put aside during the dark days of the Civil War.

Soon after the Civil War, Brownlow and Radical Republicans utilized their control of state government to enfranchise male African-American former slaves with the right to vote and run for public office in Tennessee and extend other civil rights to all former slaves. Conservative Republicans generally opposed these actions by Brownlow and his Radical Republican base, and soon after, ex-Confederate political leaders and military officers joined into this opposition directed against Brownlow and utilized the Ku Klux Klan and likeminded vigilante groups in efforts to disenfranchise African-Americans across Tennessee.

==Early life==
Brownlow was born in Wythe County, Virginia, in 1805, the eldest son of Joseph A. Brownlow and Catherine Gannaway. Joseph Brownlow, an itinerant farmer, was born in Augusta County, Virginia in 1782 and died during 1816 in Blountville, Tennessee and Catherine Gannaway followed three months later, leaving William orphaned at the age of 10. The first Brownlow forebear in Virginia was William Brownlow, who was born in Magherafelt, Ulster in 1709 and emigrated to Virginia in 1731. Brownlow and his four siblings were split up among relatives, with Brownlow spending the remainder of his childhood on his uncle John Gannaway&#x27;s farm. At age 18, Brownlow went to Abingdon where he learned the trade of carpentry from another uncle, George Winniford.

In 1825, Brownlow attended a camp meeting near Sulphur Springs, Virginia, where he experienced a dramatic spiritual rebirth. He later recalled that, suddenly, &quot;all my anxieties were at an end, all my hopes were realized, my happiness was complete.&quot; He immediately abandoned the carpentry trade and began studying to become a Methodist minister. In Fall 1826, he attended the annual meeting of the Holston Conference of the Methodist Church in Abingdon. He applied to join the travelling ministry (commonly called &quot;circuit riders&quot;), and was admitted that year by Bishop Joshua Soule.

The competition in Southern Appalachia for both converts and their tithes among the Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians was fierce, and diatribes in both speech and print against rival sectarian Christian beliefs and leaders were commonplace among missionaries. In defending his Methodist Church and its early leaders, Brownlow, took such debates to a whole new level, attacking not only Baptist and Presbyterian theology but also the character of his rival missionaries.

In 1826, Soule gave Brownlow his first assignment as a circuit rider—the Black Mountain circuit in North Carolina. It was here that Brownlow first ran afoul of the Baptists—who were spreading quickly throughout the Southern Appalachian region—and developed an immediate dislike of them, considering them narrow-minded bigots who engaged in &quot;dirty&quot; rituals such as foot washing.

During the following year in 1827, Brownlow was assigned as a circuit rider in Maryville, Tennessee area, where there was a strong Presbyterian presence, and he later recalled being constantly harassed by a young Presbyterian missionary who taunted him with Calvinistic criticisms of Methodism.

In 1828, Brownlow was sued for slander, but the suit was dismissed. In 1831, Brownlow was sued for libel by a Baptist preacher, and ordered to pay his accuser $5.

In 1832, Brownlow was assigned as a circuit rider to the Pickens District in South Carolina, which he claimed was &quot;overrun with Baptists&quot; and &quot;nullifiers.&quot; Unable to make headway in the district, Brownlow circulated his venomous 70-page pamphlet blasting the district&#x27;s Baptists, and narrowly galloped safely back into the mountains as the district&#x27;s enraged residents demanded he be hanged. Brownlow&#x27;s run-in with the South Carolina nullifiers would influence his later views on secession.

Brownlow soon afterward had his 1834 tome &quot;Helps To The Study of Presbyterianism&quot; (addressing, in part, Brownlow&#x27;s advancement of the separation of church and state in the United States and the Presbyterian Church domination of the American Sunday School Union) published in Knoxville, Tennessee by newspaper and book publisher Frederick S. Heiskell.

===Marriage===
Brownlow married a younger Eliza Ann O&#x27;Brien during 1836 in Carter County, Tennessee, where the two resided in her hometown of Elizabethton. Brownlow began working as a clerk managing her family&#x27;s O&#x27;Brien Furnace (iron foundry), which was located along the banks of the Doe River at Valley Forge about four miles southeast of Elizabethton. Brownlow would often travel by flatboat on both the Watauga River and the Holston River in East Tennessee, bringing shipments of iron castings from the O&#x27;Brien Furnance to Knoxville.

Although Brownlow left the circuit shortly after his marriage during 1836, he would continue his staunch defense of Methodism and Methodist leaders against the published attacks by religious leaders and writers of other sectarian Christian beliefs within his later newspaper columns, books, and speeches. For the remainder of his life and beyond, Brownlow was to become known to friend and foe alike as the &quot;Fighting Parson&quot;.

==Early newspaper owner==
Brownlow cut his teeth in the newspaper business during 1838 writing for the short-lived &quot;Elizabethton Republican and Manufacturer&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, initially under its editor William Gott. This weekly Elizabethton newspaper advanced Whig politics, and by the time that Brownlow had later been promoted as its editor, the &quot;Elizabethton Republican and Manufacturer&#x27;s Advocate&quot; had some three hundred subscribers and was closely associated with Mason R. Lyon.
Historian Stephen Ash says:

What made the Parson stand out was, more than anything else, his vitriolic tongue and pen. Over the course of his long career, he took up many causes. These included not only Methodism, Whiggery, and the Union, but also temperance, Know-Nothingism, and slavery. His favorite method of promoting those causes was to chastise and ridicule his opponents, and few men could do so with as much venomous wit as he. Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics, Mormons, Democrats, Republicans, secessionists, drunks, immigrants, and abolitionists—all were at one time or another on the receiving end of Brownlow&#x27;s merciless broadsides. Not surprisingly, he made many enemies. A number of them replied in kind; some tried to kill him.

The rising Elizabethton attorney T.A.R. Nelson suggested that Brownlow should launch a newspaper to support Whig Party candidates in the upcoming elections. Brownlow partnered with the Elizabethton newspaper publisher, Mason R. Lyon, and as the editor within their partnership, with the agreement that Brownlow would receive one-third of the new profits from the &quot;Tennessee Whig&quot;. Brownlow and Lyon launched their weekly &quot;Tennessee Whig&quot; on Thursday, May 16, 1839, and within several weeks, Brownlow and Lyon would rebrand their new weekly newspaper as the &quot;Elizabethton Whig&quot; starting with the June 13, 1839 edition of the newspaper.

As Brownlow&#x27;s vituperative editorial style quickly brought bitter division to Elizabethton, and he began quarreling with local Whig-turned-Democrat Landon Carter Haynes. Haynes had read law under Elizabethton attorney T.A.R. Nelson, and Haynes would later follow Nelson to Jonesborough during 1840, where Haynes would eventually edit a Jonesborough newspaper.

Brownlow and the &quot;Elizabethton Whig&quot; also relocated from Elizabethton and to Jonesborough during the same year, where the weekly Brownlow newspaper was again rebranded as the &quot;Jonesboro Whig&quot; (the Tennessee town has spelled municipal name two different ways through its history), publishing the first edition of the second volume on May 7, 1840. Brownlow had also brought along Valentine Garland along as a new business partner within his &quot;Jonesboro Whig&quot; enterprise. Garland had previously worked as a journeyman printer with the &quot;Elizabethton Whig&quot; and had purchased Lyon&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Elizabethton Whig&quot; for $550.00, but their business partnership in the &quot;Jonesboro Whig&quot; was short-lived as an announcement published on August 12, 1840 notified the &quot;Whig&quot; readers that the Brownlow and Garland business partnership was dissolved.

Brownlow would later accost Haynes in a Jonesborough street and then proceeded to beat Haynes with a sword cane, prompting Haynes to draw out his pistol and shoot Brownlow in the thigh. Haynes was later hired as editor of the competing Democratic &quot;Tennessee Sentinel&quot; the following year, and the editors Brownlow and Haynes would publish polemics targeting each other within their respective newspapers over the next several years.

In 1845, Brownlow ran against Andrew Johnson for the state&#x27;s 1st District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Using the &quot;Whig&quot; to support his campaign, he accused Johnson of being illegitimate, suggested Johnson&#x27;s relatives were murderers and thieves and stated that Johnson was an atheist. Johnson won the election by 1,300 votes, out of just over 10,000 votes cast.

Brownlow supported Whig policies such as a national bank, federal funding for internal improvements (more specifically, public improvements to the Moccasin Bend area of the Tennessee River near Chattanooga allowing for better steamboat transportation of goods to New Orleans), developing industries within northeast Tennessee, and a weakened presidency. He called Andrew Jackson the &quot;greatest curse that ever yet befell this nation,&quot; and attacked Jackson&#x27;s supporters, the Locofocos, in his 1844 book, &quot;A Political Register&quot;. While Brownlow steadfastly supported Whig candidates such as John Bell and James C. Jones, his true political idol was Kentucky senator Henry Clay. Clay was consistently Brownlow&#x27;s first choice for the party&#x27;s presidential candidate throughout the 1840s. Brownlow&#x27;s son John recalled that one of the few times he ever saw his father cry was after he had received the news of Clay&#x27;s defeat in the 1844 presidential election.

In May 1849, Brownlow relocated the &quot;Whig&quot; to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was already well known for his clashes with the Democratic &quot;Standard&quot;, which he had dubbed a &quot;filthy lying sheet.&quot; Prior to the departure of Brownlow and his newspaper from Jonesboro, an unknown assailant clubbed Brownlow in the head, leaving him bedridden for two weeks. He blamed this act on Knoxville&#x27;s newspaper interests, who feared his competition. Upon his arrival, he became embroiled in an editorial war with &quot;Knoxville Register&quot; editor John Miller McKee that lasted until McKee&#x27;s departure in 1855.

Brownlow joined the Sons of Temperance in 1850, and promoted temperance policies in the &quot;Whig&quot; (one of his more common personal attacks was to accuse his opponents of being &quot;drunkards&quot;). Following the collapse of the Whig Party in the mid-1850s, he aligned himself with the Know Nothing movement, as he had long shared this movement&#x27;s anti-Catholic and nativist sentiments. In 1856, he published a book, &quot;Americanism Contrasted with Foreignism, Romanism and Bogus Democracy&quot;, which attacked Catholicism, foreigners and Democratic politicians.

In the late 1850s, Brownlow turned his attention to Knoxville&#x27;s Democratic Party leaders and their associates. He quarreled with the radical &quot;Southern Citizen&quot;, a pro-secession newspaper published by businessman William G. Swan and Irish patriot John Mitchel (who spent time in Knoxville while in exile), and on at least one occasion, threatened Swan with a revolver. Following the failure of the Bank of East Tennessee in 1858, Brownlow ruthlessly assailed its directors. His attacks forced A.R. Crozier and William Churchwell to flee the state, and drove John H. Crozier from public life. Brownlow sued another director, J. G. M. Ramsey, winning a civil judgement on behalf of the bank&#x27;s depositors.

Partially a result of Brownlow&#x27;s persistent opposition to secession within the pages of his newspapers (and partially due to his long-time feud with Confederate sympathizer, banker, and Tennessee historian J. G. M. Ramsey), he was later jailed by Confederate States military authorities (the CSA district attorney in Knoxville, Tennessee being related to J. G. M. Ramsey) in December 1861, pardoned, and subsequently forced into exile in the northern United States.

==Sectarian debates==

While Brownlow left the preaching circuit in the 1830s, he continued responding to the critics attacking the Methodist faith until the Civil War. In 1843, his feud with Haynes led to Haynes being barred from the Methodist clergy. That same year, J.M. Smith, editor of the &quot;Abingdon Virginian&quot;, accused Brownlow of having stolen jewelry at a camp meeting. Brownlow denied the charge, and accused Smith of being an adulterer. At a meeting of the Methodists&#x27; Holston Conference that year, Smith tried unsuccessfully to have Brownlow expelled from the church.

In the late 1840s, Brownlow quarreled with Presbyterian minister Frederick Augustus Ross (1796–1883), who, from 1826 till 1852, was pastor of Old Kingsport Presbyterian Church in Kingsport, Tennessee, where Ross had taken up in 1818. Ross had earlier &quot;declared war&quot; on Methodism as a co-editor in his &quot;Calvinist Magazine&quot;, published from 1827 to 1832. Although distracted by internecine conflict within the Presbyterian Church for nearly a decade, he relaunched the &quot;Calvinist Magazine&quot; in 1845. Ross argued that the Methodist Church was despotic, comparing it to a &quot;great iron wheel&quot; that would crush American liberty. He stated that most Methodists were descended from Revolutionary War loyalists, and accused the Methodist Church founder, John Wesley, of believing in ghosts and witches.
Brownlow initially responded to Ross with a running column, &quot;F.A. Ross&#x27; Corner,&quot; in the &quot;Jonesborough Whig&quot;. In 1847, he launched a separate paper, the &quot;Jonesborough Quarterly Review&quot;, which was dedicated to refuting Ross&#x27;s attacks, and embarked on a speaking tour that summer. Brownlow argued that while it was common in Wesley&#x27;s time for people to believe in ghosts, he provided evidence that many Presbyterian ministers &quot;still&quot; believed in such things. He derided Ross as a &quot;habitual adulterer&quot; and the son of a slave, and accused his relatives of stealing and committing indecent acts (Ross&#x27;s son responded to the latter charge with a death threat). This quarrel continued until Brownlow moved to Knoxville in 1849.

In 1856, James Robinson Graves, the Landmark Baptist minister of Nashville&#x27;s Second Baptist Church, ripped Methodists in his book, &quot;The Great Iron Wheel&quot;, which used terminology and attacks similar to the ones Ross had used in the previous decade. Brownlow quickly fired back with &quot;The Great Iron Wheel Examined; Or, Its False Spokes Extracted&quot;, published that same year. He accused Graves of slandering an ex-Congressman, argued that Baptist ministers were mostly illiterate and opposed to learning, and charged that the Baptist religion was wrought with &quot;selfishness, bigotry, intolerance, and shameful want of Christian liberality.&quot; Brownlow also mocked the Baptist sectarian method of baptism, immersion.

==Slavery and secession==

Brownlow&#x27;s views on slavery changed over time. While his pre-Civil War writings reveal a strong pro-slavery slant, his name appears on an 1834 abolitionist petition. In the early 1840s, Brownlow supported the American Colonization Society, which sought to recolonize freed slaves in Liberia. In subsequent years, however, he shifted to a staunchly pro-slavery stance. Indeed he owned slaves himself. Brownlow&#x27;s friend and colleague, Oliver Perry Temple, stated that social pressure in the 1830s pushed most abolitionist Southerners to adopt pro-slavery views. Historian Robert McKenzie, however, suggests that Brownlow&#x27;s pro-slavery shift might have been rooted in the rivalry between Northern and Southern Methodists over the issue in the 1840s.

By the 1850s, Brownlow was radically pro-slavery, arguing that the institution was &quot;ordained by God.&quot; He gave a Scriptural defense of slavery in a speech delivered in Knoxville in 1857, and in the following year, he issued a challenge to Northern abolitionists to debate the issue. The challenge was initially accepted by Frederick Douglass, but Brownlow refused to debate him because of his race. The challenge was then taken up by Abram Pryne of McGrawville, New York, a clergyman with the Congregational Church, and editor of an abolitionist newspaper. At the debate, which took place in Philadelphia in September 1858, Brownlow stated in his opening argument:

Not only will I throughout this discussion openly and boldly take the ground that &quot;Slavery as it exists in America ought to be perpetuated&quot;, but that slavery is an established and inevitable condition to human society. I will maintain the ground that God always intended the relation of master and slave to exist; that Christ and the early teachers of Christianity, found slavery differing in no material respect from American slavery, &quot;incorporated into every department of society&quot; ... that slavery having existed ever since the first organization of society, it will exist to the end of time.

During the course of the Civil War, Brownlow would return to an anti-slavery stance, calling for emancipation.
Brownlow was staunchly opposed to Southern secession. He argued that secessionists wanted to form a country governed by &quot;purse-proud aristocrats&quot; of the Southern planter class. Brownlow endorsed his friend, pro-Union candidate John Bell, for president in 1860, and in September of that year, interrupted a pro-Breckinridge rally in Knoxville to spar with the rally&#x27;s keynote speaker, William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama. When South Carolina seceded following Lincoln&#x27;s election in November 1860, Brownlow derided the state and its &quot;miserable cabbage-leaf of a Palmetto flag&quot; as being descended from British loyalists, thus giving it an affinity for the aristocratic types that would govern the proposed Southern Confederacy.

By 1861, the &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot; had 14,000 subscribers, and was considered by secessionists the root of the stubborn pro-Union sentiment in East Tennessee (the region had resoundingly rejected a referendum on secession in February of that year). Knoxville&#x27;s Democrats tried to counter Brownlow by installing radical secessionist J. Austin Sperry as editor of the &quot;Knoxville Register&quot;, touching off an editorial war that lasted throughout much of the year. Brownlow called Sperry a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and a &quot;debauchee,&quot; and mocked the relatively small circulation of the &quot;Register&quot;.

Throughout the Spring of 1861, Brownlow and his colleagues, Oliver Perry Temple, T.A.R. Nelson, and Horace Maynard, canvassed East Tennessee, giving dozens of pro-Union speeches.
In May and June 1861, Brownlow represented Knox County at the East Tennessee Convention, which unsuccessfully petitioned the state legislature to allow East Tennessee to form a separate, Union-aligned state. In the weeks following Tennessee&#x27;s secession in June 1861, Brownlow used the &quot;Whig&quot; to defend Unionists accused of treasonous acts by Confederate authorities. By the Fall of 1861, the &quot;Whig&quot; was the last pro-Union newspaper in the South.
He was quoted as saying &quot;We intend to fight the secessionists until hell freezes over, and then fight them on ice.&quot;

==American Civil War==

On October 24, 1861, Brownlow suspended publication of the &quot;Whig&quot; after announcing Confederate authorities were preparing to arrest him. On November 4, he left Knoxville and went into hiding in the Great Smoky Mountains to the south, where there was a strong pro-Union presence, and would spend several weeks staying with friends in Wears Valley and Tuckaleechee Cove. On November 8, pro-Union guerillas burned several railroad bridges in East Tennessee, and attacked several others. Confederate leaders immediately suspected Brownlow of complicity, but he denied any involvement in the attacks.
Brownlow asked for permission to leave the state, which was granted by Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin. On December 6, as he was in Knoxville preparing to leave, however, Knox County Commissioner Robert B. Reynolds and Confederate States District Attorney John Crozier Ramsey (a son of Confederate States treasury agent J. G. M. Ramsey, the elder who Brownlow earlier in that year referred to as &quot;the vain old historian of Tennessee&quot;) arrested and jailed Brownlow on charges of treason. While jailed, Brownlow witnessed the trials and last moments of many of the condemned bridge-burners, which he recorded in a diary. He sent a letter to Benjamin protesting his incarceration, writing, &quot;which is your highest authority, the Secretary of War, a Major General, or a dirty little drunken attorney such as J.C. Ramsey is!&quot; After Benjamin threatened to pardon Brownlow, he was released in late December 1861.

Brownlow was escorted to Nashville (which the Union Army had captured), and crossed over into Union-controlled territory on March 3, 1862. His struggle against secession had made him a celebrity in northern states, and he embarked upon a speaking tour, starting with speeches in Cincinnati and Dayton in early April. He spoke alongside Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton at Metropolitan Hall in Indianapolis on April 8, and spoke at the Merchants&#x27; Exchange in Chicago a few days later. On April 14, he addressed the Ohio state legislature in Columbus. He hosted a banquet at the Monongahela House in Pittsburgh on April 17, and spoke at Independence Hall in Philadelphia two days later.
In Philadelphia, publisher George W. Childs convinced Brownlow to write a book, &quot;Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession&quot;, which was completed in May 1862. By September, the book had sold over 100,000 copies. Brownlow then headed to the northeast, where he addressed the New York City Chamber of Commerce on May 14, and spoke at the Academy of Music on May 15. In subsequent weeks, he spoke in Boston and various cities in New England, and later toured western New York and Illinois. In late June, he testified at the impeachment trial of West Hughes Humphreys, a Confederate judge who had denied Brownlow bail following his arrest in December.

In June 1862, workers at the Colt Armory in Hartford presented a revolver to Brownlow&#x27;s daughter, Susan, who had threatened to shoot two Confederate soldiers attempting to remove the American flag from the Brownlows&#x27; home in Knoxville in December of the previous year. Later that year, author Erastus Beadle published a dime novel, &quot;Parson Brownlow and the Unionists of East Tennessee&quot;. In 1863, Philadelphia-based music publisher Lee and Walker issued a musical score, &quot;Parson Brownlow&#x27;s Quick Step&quot;.

Brownlow returned to Nashville in early 1863, and followed Ambrose Burnsides&#x27;s forces back to Knoxville in September. In November 1863, using proceeds from his speaking tour, he relaunched the &quot;Whig&quot; under the title, &quot;Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator&quot;, and began vengefully pursuing ex-Confederates. He spent a portion of 1864 attempting to reorganize his church&#x27;s Holston Conference and realign it with the northern Methodists.

==Reconstruction-era as Governor of Tennessee==

Brownlow was nominated for governor by a convention of Tennessee Unionists in January 1865. He was the only nominee. This convention also submitted state constitutional amendments outlawing slavery and repealing the Ordinance of Secession, thus making his state the first of the Southern states to leave the Confederacy. The military governor, Andrew Johnson, had enacted a series of measures that essentially prevented ex-Confederates from voting, and on March 4, Brownlow was elected by a 23,352 to 35 vote, and the amendments passed by a similarly lopsided margin. The vote met President Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;1/10th test,&quot; which recognized elections in Southern states if the total vote was at least one-tenth the total vote in the 1860 presidential election.
In early April 1865, Brownlow arrived in Nashville, a city which he despised, having called it a &quot;dunghill,&quot; and stating it had a &quot;deadly, treasonable exhalation.&quot; He was sworn in on April 5, and submitted the 13th Amendment for ratification the following day. After this amendment was ratified, Brownlow submitted a series of bills to punish former Confederates. He disfranchised for at least five years anyone who had supported the Confederacy, and, in cases of Confederate leaders, fifteen years. He later strengthened this law to require prospective voters to &quot;prove&quot; they had supported the Union. He tried to impose fines for wearing a Confederate uniform, and attempted to bar Confederate ministers from performing marriages.

After a few months in office Brownlow decided Johnson, who had by then become President of the United States, was too lenient toward former Confederate leaders, and aligned himself with the Radical Republicans, a group which dominated Congress and vehemently opposed Johnson. In the elections for the state&#x27;s congressional seats held in August 1865, Brownlow rejected nearly one-third of the total vote to allow Radical candidate Samuel Arnell to win in the 6th District. A small group of state legislators, led by state Speaker of the House William Heiskell, turned against Brownlow, alleging his actions were too despotic, and aligned themselves with Johnson. By 1866, Brownlow had come to believe that some Southerners were plotting another rebellion, and that Andrew Johnson would be its leader.

===Opposition to the Ku Klux Klan===

Brownlow began calling for civil rights to be extended to freed slaves, stating that &quot;a loyal Negro was more deserving than a disloyal white man.&quot; In May 1866, he submitted the 14th Amendment for ratification, which the Radicals in Congress supported, but Johnson and his allies opposed. The pro-Johnson minority in the statehouse attempted to flee Nashville to prevent a quorum, and the House sergeant-at-arms was dispatched to arrest them. Two were captured—Pleasant Williams and A. J. Martin—and confined to the House committee room, giving the House the necessary number of members present to establish a quorum. After the amendment passed by a 43-11 vote, Heiskell refused to sign it and resigned in protest. His successor signed it, however, and the amendment was ratified. In transmitting the news to Congress, Brownlow taunted Johnson, stating, &quot;My compliments to the dead dog in the White House.&quot; Tennessee was readmitted to the Union shortly afterward, and was represented in Congress again by 1866; Tennessee was the only former Confederate state that bypassed Military Reconstruction.

The Radicals nominated Brownlow for a second term for governor in February 1867. His opponent was Emerson Etheridge, a frequent critic of the Brownlow administration. That same month, the legislature passed a bill giving the state&#x27;s black residents the right to vote, and Union Leagues were organized to help freed slaves in this process. Members of these leagues frequently clashed with disfranchised ex-Confederates, including members of the burgeoning Ku Klux Klan, and Brownlow organized a state guard, led by General Joseph Alexander Cooper, to protect voters (and harass the opposition). With the state&#x27;s ex-Confederates disfranchised, Brownlow easily defeated Etheridge in the 1867 election.

By 1868, Klan violence had increased significantly. The organization had sent Brownlow a death threat, and had come close to assassinating Congressman Samuel Arnell. General Nathan B. Forrest joined the Klan, becoming its first Grand Wizard, partially in response to the disfranchisement policies of Brownlow. The &quot;William G. Brownlow Family Papers, 1836-1900&quot;, archived by the Tennessee Secretary of State, contains one letter dated July 4, 1868, from the Great-Grand Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan Stella Morton, in which Morton threatens Governor Brownlow&#x27;s life.

In an interview with the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot;, Forrest stated, &quot;I have never recognized the present government in Tennessee as having any legal existence.&quot; He objected to Governor Brownlow calling out the militia and warned if they &quot;committed outrages&quot; that &quot;they and Mr. Brownloe&#x27;s government will be swept out of existence not a Radical will be left alive.&quot; Forrest claimed the Klan had more than 40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 in the southern states. He said the Klan supported the Democratic Party. Forrest suggested that a proclamation of Brownlow called for shooting members of the Klan. Forrest denied being a member of the Klan himself.

Forrest and twelve other Klan members submitted a petition to Brownlow, stating they would cease their activities if Confederates were given the right to vote. Brownlow rejected this, however, and set about reorganizing the state guard and pressing the legislature for still greater enforcement powers.

Brownlow endorsed Ulysses S. Grant for president in 1868, and asked for federal troops to be stationed in 21 Tennessee counties to counter rising Klan activity. The state legislature granted him the power to throw out entire counties&#x27; voter registrations if he thought they included disfranchised voters. In October 1868, prior to the election, Brownlow discarded all registered voters in Lincoln County. Following the election, two of the Radicals&#x27; congressional candidates, Lewis Tillman in the 4th District and William J. Smith in the 8th District, were initially defeated. Brownlow, believing Klan intimidation to be the reason for their defeat, rejected the votes from Marshall and Coffee counties, allowing Tillman to win, and rejected the votes from Fayette and Tipton counties, allowing Smith to win.

In February 1869, as Brownlow&#x27;s final term was near its end, he placed nine counties under martial law, arguing this was necessary to quell rising Klan violence. He also dispatched five state guard companies to occupy Pulaski, where the Klan had been founded. After Brownlow left office in March, Forrest ordered the Klan to destroy its costumes and cease all activities.

==U.S. Senate and his later life==

Following his reelection as Governor of Tennessee in 1867, Brownlow decided he would not seek a third term, and instead sought election to the U.S. Senate seat that would be vacated by David T. Patterson, Andrew Johnson&#x27;s son-in-law, in 1869. In October 1867, the state legislature elected Brownlow over William B. Stokes by a 63 to 39 vote. By the time he was sworn in on March 4, 1869, a persistent nervous disease had weakened him considerably, and the Senate clerk had to read his speeches. One of his speeches was a defense of Ambrose Burnside, the Union general who had liberated Knoxville from Confederate forces in 1863.

Brownlow was a member of the U.S. Senate when the final version of the bill S. 810 was introduced onto the Senate floor on April 19, 1870, enacted the next month by the U.S. Congress, and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on May 31, 1870 as the Enforcement Act of 1870 (also known under the popular titles as the Civil Rights Act of 1870 or the First Ku Klux Klan Act) and the later Second Enforcement Act of 1871 (also known under the popular titles as the Civil Rights Act of 1871 or the Third Ku Klux Klan Act) of the United States Congress which empowered the President to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in order to combat the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacy organizations.
Interviewed (while suffering visibly from the &quot;palsy&quot; that afflicted him in later life) in 1871 by a reporter from the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, Brownlow essentially predicted the failure of Reconstruction, the coming nadir of American race relations, and beyond:

After his Senate term ended in 1875, Brownlow returned to Knoxville. His successor as governor, DeWitt Clinton Senter, had undone most of his Radical initiatives, allowing Democrats to regain control of the state government. Having sold the &quot;Whig&quot; in 1869, Brownlow purchased an interest in the &quot;Knoxville Chronicle&quot;, a Republican newspaper published by his old protégé, William Rule. The paper&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Knoxville Whig and Chronicle&quot;. In 1876, Brownlow endorsed Rutherford B. Hayes for president. In December of the same year, he spoke at the opening of Knoxville College, which had been established for the city&#x27;s African-American residents.

On the night of April 28, 1877, Brownlow collapsed at his home, and died the following afternoon. The cause of death was given as &quot;paralysis of the bowels.&quot; He was interred in Knoxville&#x27;s Old Gray Cemetery following a funeral procession described by his colleague, Oliver Perry Temple, as the largest in the city&#x27;s history up to that time.

==Legacy==

In 1870, William Rule, who had been a journalist for the &quot;Whig&quot;, launched the &quot;Knoxville Chronicle&quot;, which he considered the &quot;Whig&quot;&#x27;s pro-Republican successor. Rule continued editing this paper, which was eventually renamed &quot;The Knoxville Journal&quot;, until his death in 1928. The &quot;Knoxville Journal&quot; remained one of Knoxville&#x27;s daily newspapers until it folded in 1991. Adolph Ochs, who later became publisher of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, began his career at the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in the early 1870s.

William Rule wrote that Brownlow was &quot;a master of invective and burning sarcasm, and he flourished in an age when such things were expected of a public journalist.&quot; J. Austin Sperry, Brownlow&#x27;s rival editor in pre-Civil War Knoxville, admitted that Brownlow was a remarkable judge of human nature.

Brownlow&#x27;s long-time colleague, Oliver Perry Temple, wrote of him:

It was easy for friends to persuade Mr. Brownlow to do anything that did not violate his sense of right; to force him was impossible. A child could lead him; a giant could not drive him. When his mind was once made up, it was as immovable as the mountains.

Brownlow remained a divisive figure for decades after his death. In 1999, historian Stephen Ash wrote, &quot;more than 120 years after his death, merely mentioning his name in the Volunteer State can evoke raucous laughter or bitter curses.&quot; Brownlow has been described as &quot;Tennessee&#x27;s worst governor,&quot; and the &quot;most hated man in Tennessee History.&quot; A 1981 poll of fifty-two Tennessee historians that ranked the state&#x27;s governors on ability, accomplishments, and statesmanship, placed Brownlow dead last.

Journalist Steve Humphrey argued that Brownlow was a talented newspaper editor and reporter, as evidenced by his reporting on events such as the opening of the Gayoso Hotel in Memphis and Knoxville&#x27;s 1854 cholera epidemic.

The Capitol Committee of the Tennessee General Assembly removed the official portrait of Governor Parson Brownlow that had only been briefly installed during April 1987 within the Legislative Library of state capitol building, upon the recommendation of Democratic Tennessee state Senator Douglas Henry.

==Family==

Brownlow married Eliza O&#x27;Brien (1819–1914) during 1836 in Elizabethton, Tennessee. They had seven children: Susan, John Bell, James Patton, Mary, Fannie, Annie, and Caledonia Temple.

Eliza O&#x27;Brien Brownlow lived at the family&#x27;s home formerly on East Cumberland Avenue (at the present day James White Parkway) in Knoxville until her death in 1914 at the age of 94. In the 1890s and early 1900s, numerous visitors, including three presidents (William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft), called on Eliza Brownlow when visiting Knoxville.

The Brownlows&#x27; older son, John Bell Brownlow (1839–1922), was a colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War. In the decades following his father&#x27;s death, he helped finance the development of a Knoxville neighborhood (just north of modern Fourth and Gill) which for years was known as &quot;Brownlow.&quot; Brownlow Elementary School, which served this neighborhood from 1913 to 1995, still stands, and has been converted into urban lofts.

The Brownlows&#x27; younger son, James Patton Brownlow (1842–1879), was also a colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War, though he was later brevetted to brigadier general by President Andrew Johnson. He served as an adjutant general in the state guard during his father&#x27;s term as governor.

Walter P. Brownlow (1851–1910), a nephew of Parson Brownlow, served as a U.S. congressman from Tennessee&#x27;s 1st district from 1897 until his death.

James Stewart Martin (1826–1907), another nephew of Parson Brownlow (the son of his sister, Nancy), served as a U.S. congressman from Illinois in the mid-1870s.

Louis Brownlow (1879–1963), a prominent 20th-century political scientist and city planner, was a grandson of one of Parson Brownlow&#x27;s first cousins. He served a tumultuous 3-year term as Knoxville&#x27;s city manager in the 1920s.

<doc id="327783" wikidata="Q888954" url="?curid=327783" title="Boca del Río, Veracruz">
<text>Boca del Río is a city and municipality located in the center of the Mexican state of Veracruz. The small city of Boca del Río serves as the seat of the municipality. The municipality lies just south of the municipality of Veracruz, and contains a part of the city and city and port of Veracruz. It is a port in its own right, as well as the metropolitan area&#x27;s center for business travel and upscale hotels and restaurants. The city contains two museums, one dedicated to Agustín Lara and the other a military ship that has been converted into a museum. However, the municipality&#x27;s main feature is the World Trade Center Veracruz, which hosts business meetings, conferences and conventions.

==History==
The name “Boca del Río” is from Spanish, meaning “mouth of the river” and refers to the mouth of the Jamapa River as it flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The pre-Hispanic name for the area was Tlapaquitan, which means “divided land.”

From 1000 to 1200 BCE, the area was under Olmec domination. The area officially came under Aztec domination in 1474 and is mentioned in the Codex Mendoza as part of the district of Cuetlachtlan. However, the Aztecs had been active here for sometime before that. In 1518, Juan de Grijalva came to the area with his crew and named the river “Río de las Banderas” because they saw indigenous peoples communicating across the river with flags. In the same year, the first Christian rites were performed at a chapel called Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana. In 1879, the localities of Hacienda de Santa Maria Punta, Hato and Anton Lizardo were separated from the municipality and joined with neighboring Alvarado municipality. In 1892, the Veracruz- Tierra Blanca rail line was built, passing through Boca del Río. The settlement gained city status in 1988.

From the early 2000s, crime and pollution have been the city&#x27;s major challenges. Like much of the rest of Mexico, drug trafficking causes significant incidents of violence such as the ambush and murder of three agents of the Inter-municipal Police and the murder and mutilation of rivals. There is a problem with the theft of aluminum and copper cables from certain parts of the city but the major crime story to date has been the theft of over 1 million pesos worth of merchandise, mostly jewelry and watches, from the Ejército Mexicano branch of the Nacional Monte de Piedad. The thieves had cut a hole in the back wall of the building and then cut the alarm system and cameras to work their way into the vault.

From the late 20th century to the present, pollution, especially of the beaches, has been an issue. There are complaints that the waters off the beaches of Boca del Rio, especially Playa Los Arcos are contaminated, with foamy, grey, malodorous waters. Authorities state that all of Boca&#x27;s beaches are within sanitary norms and pose no risk to visitors. Merchants in Boca del Río, as well as the city of Veracruz, have appealed to state authorities for help with the sanitation problems of the beaches here, claiming that the garbage and foul smell drive away tourists. In 2008, the city began a program to recycle motor oil and other used automobile fluids in cooperation with a company called Eco-Klin and the federal environmental agency SEMARNAT. The purpose of the free collection system is to keep the fluids from being dumped in drains or burned by consumers.

In October 2007, a statue of former President Vicente Fox, sculpted by Bernardo Luis López Artasanchez, was pulled down by youths on the boulevard named for the ex-president. Local members of the political party PRI were blamed for the vandalism. The event caused a major scandal in the state of Veracruz and received national press, as Fox was the first non-PRI president since the early 20th century. The statue has since then been repaired and put back in its place.
During the AH1N1 crisis in Mexico in April 2009, beaches of Veracruz and Boca del Rio suffered a 43 to 46 percent decline in visitors.

==The city==
The city is part of the metropolitan area of Veracruz and its port works closely with the port of Veracruz. Much of the area&#x27;s modern and luxury hotel and restaurant infrastructure is located here, centered around the World Trade Center Veracruz. The main church is called the Parish of Santa Ana, which was constructed in 1776. Nearby is the colonial-style municipal palace. The Plaza Civica is in front of the municipal palace and contains the Nahuatl Fountain. The main dock is called Muella Banderas.

The Agustín Lara House Museum, also called the “La Casita Blanca” (The Little White House) exhibits works, photographs and personal effects of the poet Agustín Lara, who was called “El Flaco de Oro” (The Golden Skinny One). News clips, caricatures and a replica of the radio studio where he hosted &quot; La Hora Azul&quot; (&quot;The Blue Hour&quot;) are among the items on display. Lara was one of the city&#x27;s most famous sons as a popular songwriter and singer in Mexico. Lara began his career playing the piano in brothels and later became a bullfighter. Lara had seven wives, one of whom was Mexican screen diva María &quot;La Doña&quot; Félix, for whom he wrote the song, &quot;María Bonita.&quot; To be a gentleman, when he and Félix were about to break up, he married her to &quot;make an honest woman of her&quot; even though they had lived together for years 

A ship museum called the Buque Cañonero (Cannon Ship) Guanajuato is located here. When the ship was decommissioned, it was decided to restore it as a naval museum rather than to scrap it. It is considered to be one of the most important naval museums in Latin America. The ship contains an arms room, a telecommunications room, infirmary, bunks, dining room and library. The themes covered include the history of the ship itself as well as naval warfare simulation room, based on the technology of the Xbox 360.

Boca del Río&#x27;s two major festivals occur in the summer and are collectively known as the Fiestas del Boca del Río (Festivals of Boca del Rio) or simply Fiestas de Boca. Events take place at various locations such as the Plaza Civica, the Plaza Dorada, the Gutierrez Barrios Theatre, the Plaza Banderas, the San Pedro y San Pablo Church and Vicente Fox Boulevard. Bocafest occurs each year in June when a number of musical artists play in the main venues of the city, especially in Plaza Banderas. Musical styles represented range from the very traditional Mexican folk to electronic music. In 2008, featured artists included Natalia Lafourcade and Aleks Syntek. Other events include Mexican and Caribbean folk dance and music and art expositions. The Feast of Saint Ann is the main traditional festival of the city, taking place from 24 to 31 July. The days are filled with cultural as well as religious events.

The Expo Regional Ylang Ylang (Ylang Ylang Regional Expo) occurs from the end of May to the beginning of June and showcases the area agricultural, craft, industrial and commercial production. It also has cockfights, rodeos (called palenques) and folkdance such as jaripeos. From the end of May to the beginning of June is held the annual agricultural, crafts, industrial and commercial fair of the city, with cockfights, rodeos and folk dance. Crafts here include seashell jewelry, wooden boxes, key rings and trinkets made with ocean materials such as coral and pebbles.

Veracruz&#x27;s annual carnival parade passes along the boardwalk that connects the port of Boca del Rio with the port of Veracruz. It is one of the highlights of the event, which has contained as many as 35 dance groups, 10 bands and over 100 floats.
The city is mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records for preparing the largest seafood-filled fish in the world.

===The municipality===
The major attraction of the municipality is the World Trade Center Veracruz, serving business travelers. The World Trade Center Veracruz is affiliated with the World Trade Center Association and is the organization&#x27;s third site in Mexico. The center has 16,000m2 of space with elevators, escalators, handicapped access, commercial stands, lockers, ticket windows, parking lot and direct access to a neighboring mall and hotel. It hosts business meetings and professional conferences as well as cultural events. It has its own art gallery, the Galería Veracruzana de Arte (Veracruz Gallery of Art), which is a joint Project between the World Trade Center Veracruz and the Coordinación de Difusión Cultural y Artística del Sistema DIF Estatal (Coordination of Cultural and Artistic Diffusion of the State DIF System). The art center holds temporary exhibits from a variety of artist and with different themes. Some of the shows in 2009 included a collection of portraits done by Mexican artist Enrique Estrada, landscapes of Veracruz state by Armando Zesatti and a photo exhibit named “Lenguajes fotograficas.” The World Trade Center Veracruz also contains an ice-skating rink, something that has become popular in Mexico.
As municipal seat, the city of Boca del Río is the local government of 18 other localities, which together make up a territory of 42.77km2. Only 6.92% of the municipality&#x27;s population of 144,550 lives in the municipal seat, while 132,011 (91.32%) lives in the Veracruz city portion of the municipality. The municipality borders the municipalities of Veracruz, Alvarado and Medellín with the Gulf of Mexico to the east. It has a territory of 42.77km2. It is located on the central zone of the state and part of the plains known as the Llanuras del Sotavento. The main river is the Jamapa, which empties here into the Gulf of Mexico. At the mouth of this river, there are mangroves and boat tours are available to see them and the nearby Moreno Arroyo. The municipality has a hot, humid climate with most rain falling from June to October. It is mostly covered in perennially green tropical forest with some pines in the highest elevations. Tree species that can be found here include sapodilla and mahogany with most animal species being small mammals such as armadillos, squirrels, rabbits, opossums and foxes. There are deposits of oil and natural gas within the territory.

About 1,618 hectares of the municipality is dedicated to agriculture, mostly growing corn and beans. Livestock is mostly dairy and beef cattle, with some pigs, sheep, horses and domestic fowl. In the higher elevations there is some lumber harvesting. This employs less than two percent of the municipality&#x27;s population. Industry is mostly dedicated to citrus packing, manufacture of concrete tubes, chemical products and pre-mixed concrete. This employs about a third of the municipality&#x27;s population, with commerce employing almost the rest of the people. Tourism is mostly related to business and professional conferences, much of which is related to the World Trade Center Veracruz.
Off the coast of Boca del Río is an island called Isla de Sacrificios (part of Veracruz Municipality), which measures 450 meters long and 198 meters wide, the largest of a group of islands that are in front of the Boca del Río and Veracruz ports. The island is part of a system of twenty three coral reefs called the Veracruz Reef System which is a national park.(murtur) It is possible to kayak to the Isla de Sacrificios to observe seagulls, pelicans and the fish that inhabit the coral reef. In 1983, a study and initial cleanup project was undertaken at the island, which collected fifty tons of trash. Shortly thereafter, the island was closed to the public and since then, there has been a struggle between authorities, tour operators and fisherman as to the fate of the island. There are those who would like to build hotels, restaurants and other facilities for ecotourism. However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event. The island contains one of the lighthouses used to guide ships into the ports of Veracruz and Boca del Rio.

<doc id="327785" wikidata="Q1572845" url="?curid=327785" title="Broadcast syndication">
<text>Broadcast syndication is the practice of content owners leasing the right to broadcast their content to other television stations or radio stations, without having an official broadcast network to air it on. It is common in the United States where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates. Syndication is less widespread in the rest of the world, as most countries have centralized networks or television stations without local affiliates. Shows can be syndicated internationally, although this is less common.

Three common types of syndication are: &quot;first-run&quot; syndication, which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically for the purpose of selling it into syndication; &quot;Off-network&quot; syndication (colloquially called a &quot;rerun&quot;), which is the licensing of a program whose first airing was on stations inside the television network that produced it, or in some cases a program that was first-run syndicated, to other stations; and &quot;public broadcasting&quot; syndication.

==Types==

===First-run syndication===
In first-run syndication, a program is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show. Often these programs are made specifically to sell directly into syndication and not made for any particular network.

===Off-network syndication===
In off-network syndication, a program whose first airing was on network television (or, in some cases, first-run syndication) is licensed for local broadcast on individual stations. Reruns are usually found on stations affiliated with smaller networks like The CW or MyNetworkTV, especially since these networks broadcast one less hour of prime time network programming than the Big Four television networks and far less network-provided daytime television (none at all for these networks). A show usually enters off-network syndication when it has built up about four seasons&#x27; worth or between 80 and 100 episodes, though for some genres the number could be as low as 65. Successful shows in syndication can cover production costs and make a profit, even if the first run of the show was not profitable.

===Public broadcasting syndication===
This type of syndication has arisen in the U.S. as a parallel service to member stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the handful of independent public broadcasting stations. This form of syndication more closely resembles the news agency model, where nominally competing networks share resources and rebroadcast each other&#x27;s programs. For example, National Public Radio (NPR) stations commonly air the Public Radio Exchange&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot;, which may contain stories produced by NPR journalists.

When syndicating a show, the production company, or a distribution company called a syndicator, attempts to license the show to one station in each media market or area, or to a commonly owned station group, within the country and internationally. If successful, this can be lucrative, but the syndicator may only be able to license the show in a small percentage of the markets. Syndication differs from licensing the show to a television network. Once a network picks up a show, it is usually guaranteed to run on most or all the network&#x27;s affiliates on the same day of the week and at the same time (in a given time zone, in countries where this is a concern). Some production companies create their shows and license them to networks at a loss, at least at first, hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off-network syndication will turn a profit for the show. A syndicated program is licensed to stations for &quot;cash&quot; (the stations purchase the rights to local insertion some or all of the advertisements at their level); given to stations for access to airtime (wherein the syndicators get the advertising revenue); or the combination of both. The trade of program for airtime is called &quot;barter.&quot;

In the United States (as a result of continued relaxation of station ownership regulations since the 1970s), syndicated programs are usually licensed to stations on a group level, with multiple stations owned and/or operated by the same broadcasting group carrying the program in different markets (except in areas where another station holds the market rights to the program) – making it increasingly more efficient for syndicators to gain widespread national clearances for their programs. Many syndicated programs are traditionally sold first to one of six &quot;key&quot; station groups (ABC Owned Television Stations, NBC Owned Television Stations, CBS Television Stations, Fox Television Stations, Telemundo Station Group, and Televisa Univision), allowing their programs to gain clearances in the largest U.S. TV markets (such as New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia, where all six aforementioned groups each own stations), before striking deals with other major and smaller station owners. Shows airing in first-run syndication that are carried primarily by an owned-and-operated station of a network may sometimes be incorrectly referenced as a network program, especially if said network&#x27;s syndication wing distributes the program, regardless to its distribution to stations of varying network affiliations and despite the fact it is not part of an individual network&#x27;s base schedule.

Since the early 2000s, some programs being proposed for national distribution in first-run syndication have been test marketed on a selected number of or all stations owned by certain major station group, allowing the distributor to determine whether a national roll-out is feasible based on the ratings accrued in the selected markets where the program is being aired.

While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable, the producers often enjoy more content freedom in the absence of network&#x27;s standards and practices departments; frequently, some innovative ideas are explored by first-run syndicated programming which the networks are leery of giving airtime to. Meanwhile, top-rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach as high as 98%. Very often, series that are aired in syndication have reduced running times. For example, a standard American sitcom runs 22 minutes, but in syndication it may be reduced to 20 minutes to make room for more commercials.

Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication. Game shows, some &quot;tabloid&quot; and entertainment news shows, and talk shows are broadcast daily on weekdays, while most other first-run syndicated shows are broadcast on a weekly basis and are usually aired on weekends only. Big discussion occurred in the 1990s and 2000s about whether previously aired episodes of a show could become syndicated while new episodes of it continued to air on its original network. There had been much opposition to this idea and it was generally viewed to lead to the death of the show. However, licensing a program for syndication actually resulted in the increased popularity for shows that remained in production. A prime example is &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==First-run syndication in the U.S.==
As with radio in the U.S., television networks, particularly in their early years, did not offer a full day&#x27;s worth of programming for their affiliates, even in the evening or &quot;prime time&quot; hours. In the early days of television, this was less of an issue, as there were in most markets fewer TV stations than there were networks (at the time four), which meant that the stations that did exist affiliated with multiple networks and, when not airing network or local programs, typically sign-on and sign-off. The loosening of licensing restrictions, and the subsequent passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act, meant that by the early 1960s, the situation had reversed. There were now more stations than the networks—now down to three in number after the failure of the DuMont Television Network—could serve. Some stations were not affiliated with any network, operating as independent stations. Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming with content that could be flexibly scheduled. The development of videotape and, much later, enhanced satellite down link access furthered these options. While most past first-run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication, some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first-run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation. Until about 1980, most syndicated series were distributed to stations either on 16mm film prints (off-network reruns, feature films, and cartoons) or videotape (topical series such as the talk shows of Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin, and variety and quiz shows).

Ziv Television Programs, after establishing itself as a major radio syndicator, was the first major first-run television syndicator, creating several long-lived series in the 1950s and selling them directly to regional sponsors, who in turn sold the shows to local stations. Ziv&#x27;s first major TV hit was &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;. Ziv had the foresight to film &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; in color, even though color TV was still in its infancy and most stations did not yet support the technology. Among the most widely seen Ziv offerings were &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, &quot;I Led Three Lives&quot;, &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; and &quot;Ripcord&quot;. Some first-run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the 1950s and early 1960s, such as the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;. The networks began syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s, and first-run syndication shrank sharply for a decade. Some stalwart series continued, including &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;; other ambitious projects were also to flourish, however briefly, such as &quot;The Play of the Week&quot; (1959–1961), produced by David Susskind (of the syndicated talk show &quot;Open End&quot; and also producer of such network fare as &quot;NYPD&quot;).

Among other syndicated series of the 1950s were MCA&#x27;s &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; (vaudeville-style comedy) and Guild Films&#x27; &quot;Liberace&quot; (musical variety) and &quot;Life With Elizabeth&quot;, a domestic situation comedy that introduced Betty White to a national audience. In addition to the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, many other series were based on comic strips and aimed at the juvenile audience, including &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;. Original juvenile adventure series included &quot;Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion&quot;, &quot;Cowboy G-Men&quot;, and &quot;Ramar of the Jungle&quot;. Series based on literary properties included &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (based on &quot;Treasure Island&quot;), and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Several of these were co-productions between U.S. and European (usually British) companies. &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; pioneered in the area of first-run animated series; followed by &quot;Bucky and Pepito&quot;, &quot;Colonel Bleep&quot;, &quot;Spunky and Tadpole&quot;, &quot;Q. T. Hush&quot;, and others. (All of these were five-minute shorts designed to be placed within locally hosted kiddie shows.) Syndicated sports programming included &quot;Championship Bowling&quot; and &quot;All-Star Golf&quot;, both produced by Chicago-based Walter Schwimmer Inc.

In addition to regular series, syndicators also offered packages of feature films, cartoons, and short subjects originally made for movie theaters. Until late in the 1950s, however, much of the theatrical product available consisted of low-budget secondary features (mainly Westerns) with relatively few notable stars. One syndication company, National Telefilm Associates, attempted to create a &quot;NTA Film Network&quot; of stations showing its lineup of first-run series, which included syndicated programs such as &quot;Police Call&quot; (1955), &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1957–1959), &quot;The Passerby&quot;, &quot;Man Without a Gun&quot; (1957–1959), and &quot;This is Alice&quot; (1958). The venture lasted five years and closed down in 1961.

By the late 1960s, a &quot;de facto&quot; two-tiered system had developed in the United States, with the major network affiliates (usually on longer-range VHF stations) consistently drawing more viewers than their UHF, independent counterparts; syndicators thus hoped to get their programs onto the major network stations, where spots in the lineup were far more scarce. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rulings in 1971 curtailed the U.S. networks&#x27; ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the &quot;fringe time&quot;, notably the 7–8 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) hour of &quot;prime time&quot;, with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities (off-network syndicated repeats were also banned); some projects of this sort came to fruition, though these were usually relatively commercial and slick efforts such as Group W&#x27;s &quot;Evening/PM Magazine&quot; franchise, and such pre-existing national projects as the brief commercial-television run of William F. Buckley Jr.&#x27;s interview/debate series &quot;Firing Line&quot;. The more obvious result was an increase in Canadian-produced syndicated dramatic series, such as &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot; and the Colgate-sponsored &quot;Dr. Simon Locke&quot;. Game shows, often evening editions of network afternoon series, flourished, and a few odd items such as &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;, canceled by NBC in 1971, had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor-made for the early fringe.

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1971, the U.S. FCC passed the Prime Time Access Rule and Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which prevented networks from programming one particular hour of prime time programming on its television stations each night and required the networks to spin off their syndication arms as independent companies. Although the intent of the rule was to encourage local stations to produce their own programs for this time slot, budgetary limits instead prompted stations to buy syndicated programs to fill the slot. This, coupled with an increase in UHF independent stations, caused a boom in the syndication market. In the 1970s, first-run syndication continued to be an odd mix: cheaply produced, but not always poor quality, &quot;filler&quot; programming. These included the dance-music show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, and 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, a television variation on the popular &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; theatrically released collections of film clips from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library.

There were also many imported programs distributed this way. These include the documentary series &quot;Wild, Wild World of Animals&quot; (repackaged by Time Life with narration by William Conrad) and Thames Television&#x27;s sober and necessarily grim &quot;The World at War&quot;. &quot;The Starlost&quot; (1973) was a Canadian series, apparently modified from the vision of science fiction writers Harlan Ellison and Ben Bova. Britain&#x27;s ITC Entertainment, headed by Lew Grade, made &quot;UFO&quot; (1970) and &quot;&quot; (1975). These two series were created by Gerry Anderson (and his associates), previously best known for Supermarionation (a combination of puppetry and animation) series such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. The most successful syndicated show in the United States in the 1970s was probably &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, also from Lew Grade&#x27;s company. Animated series from the 1980s &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot; and &quot;Around the World with Willy Fog&quot; came from Spanish animation production company BRB Internacional and their Japanese co-producers Nippon Animation.

Game shows thrived in syndication during the decade. Nightly versions of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; premiered in the late 1960s and found loyal audiences for many years. Several daytime network games began producing once-a-week nighttime versions for broadcast in the early evening hours, usually with bigger prizes and often featuring different hosts (emcees were limited to appearing on one network and one syndicated game simultaneously) and modified titles (&quot;Match Game PM&quot;, &quot;The $100,000 Name That Tune&quot; or &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;, for example). A few independent game shows, such as &quot;Sports Challenge&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot;, also entered the syndication market around this time. Of these shows, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; were the first to jump to twice-a-week syndicated versions, in about 1973. Another popular daytime show to have a weekly syndicated version was &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which began concurrently in weekly syndication and on CBS; the syndicated &quot;nighttime&quot; version was hosted by Dennis James for its first five years, after which daytime host Bob Barker took over for another three years of weekly episodes (even though, by this point, the daytime and nighttime shows had diverged noticeably). The nighttime version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; (1977) quickly jumped from once-weekly to twice, and finally to five-day-a-week airings, and its massive popularity, along with that of new five-day-a-week entries like Jack Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; (1978), the move of &quot;Match Game&quot;″s daily run from CBS to syndication (1979), and Chuck Barris&#x27;s increasingly raunchy remakes of his 1960s hits &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, brought an end (with rare exceptions) to the era of once-a-week games. Also popular in first-run syndication and daytime was &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, hosted by Barris throughout most of its run (Gary Owens hosted the first syndicated season).

A number of half-hour musical-variety shows were also offered in the early 1970s, generally built around personable middle-of-the-road singers like Bobby Vinton, Bobby Goldsboro, Dolly Parton, and Andy Williams, or groups like Sha Na Na, The Johnny Mann Singers, and The Golddiggers. &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot; (1972) was a Hanna-Barbera cartoon series attempting to ape the &quot;All in the Family&quot;-style sitcoms; &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; (1969), an Australian children&#x27;s series, or &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; (a decade later, the decidedly not-for-children Australian &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; would have a brief U.S. syndicated run); and a Canadian sketch-comedy series began appearing on U.S. television stations in 1977—&quot;Second City Television&quot;, which would eventually find a home, for two seasons, on NBC, as &quot;SCTV Network 90&quot; (and on premium cable channel Cinemax by 1983).

The Universal/Paramount-produced package of original programming, &quot;Operation Prime Time&quot;, began appearing on &quot;ad hoc&quot; quasi-networks of (almost by necessity) non-network stations in the U.S. in 1978, with a mini-series adaptation of John Jakes&#x27; &quot;The Bastard&quot;. From the later 1960s into the late 1970s, Westinghouse also found considerable success with &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, a variety/talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style, which aired in the afternoons in most markets; similar programs soon followed featuring Merv Griffin, who had been the host of CBS&#x27; most sustained late-night answer to &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; previously, and another network veteran, Dinah Shore. Also notable was the growing success of audience-participation talk shows, particularly that of the innovator of the format, Phil Donahue.

First-run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows that were no longer wanted by television networks to remain on the air. In 1971, ABC canceled &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years, and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns (with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes) distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority. Also in 1971, CBS dropped &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, the latter show&#x27;s run ending as part of the network&#x27;s cancellation of all of its rural-oriented shows (known then as &quot;rural purge&quot;, which also resulted in the cancellations of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;). &quot;Lassie&quot; entered first-run syndication for two years, while &quot;Hee Haw&quot; continued to produce new episodes until 1992.

====First-run syndicated comedy====

Throughout the mid-to-late 1980s into the early 1990s, sitcoms continued to enter first-run syndication after being canceled by the networks, the most successful of which were &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; and &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;. Other sitcoms during this time to enter first-run syndication after network cancellation included &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, &quot;Webster&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, &quot;9 to 5&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, and &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in reruns. Other sitcoms, such as &quot;Small Wonder&quot;, &quot;Out of This World&quot;, &quot;The Munsters Today&quot;, and &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (as well as more action-adventure oriented series like &quot;Superboy&quot; and &quot;My Secret Identity&quot;) enjoyed success in syndication throughout their entire run.

====Dramatic first-run syndicated programs====
The broadcast networks aired many action-adventure programs from the 1950s to the 1980s. By the late 1980s, however, increasing production costs made them less attractive to the networks. Studios found that reruns of one-hour dramas did not sell as well as sitcoms, so they were unable to fully recoup the shows&#x27; costs using the traditional deficit financing model. When NBC canceled the television series adaptation of &quot;Fame&quot; after only two seasons, the producers made special arrangements with LBS Communications, which resulted in MGM reviving the series for first-run syndication in the fall of 1983, where it continued for four more seasons, with the last first-run episode airing in the U.S. on May 18, 1987.

&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; debuted in 1987, and became the most-watched syndicated show throughout its seven-year run. Its great success caused many others to debut. &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot; (a horror series which shared its title with the successful movie franchise) also debuted in 1987. The next syndicated shows that debuted in 1988 were &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;. &quot;Baywatch&quot;, which debuted in 1989 on NBC and was canceled after one season also became one of the most watched syndicated shows throughout its ten-year-run, garnering a worldwide audience.

By 1994, there were more than 20 one-hour syndicated shows. &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot; were also syndicated. &quot;&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;&quot; were also popular, often tying Deep Space Nine at 5% to 6% of the Nielsen-monitored audience. &quot;Forever Knight&quot; drew devoted &quot;cult&quot; audiences (3% rating). &quot;Psi Factor&quot; and &quot;&quot; attempted to draw on the audience for the Fox series &quot;The X-Files&quot; (as did the short-lived spinoff &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;). Among the other series were &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, &quot;V.I.P.&quot;, &quot;High Tide&quot;, &quot;She Spies&quot;, and &quot;Once a Thief&quot;.

&quot;Babylon 5&quot; began life in 1993 on the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN), moved into syndicated distribution when its network was displaced by WB/UPN-affiliated stations, and eventually ended its final season on TNT (1998). In 1997 &quot;&quot;, based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry, premiered in syndication. Three years later, a second Gene Roddenberry series, &quot;Andromeda&quot; also premiered in syndication. As emerging networks WB and UPN signed contracts with formerly-independent stations, and the syndication market shrunk, Andromeda season 5 moved to the Syfy Channel (2004).

There was not another first-run syndicated drama (or a first-run scripted series in syndication) until 2008, when Disney-ABC Domestic Television and ABC Studios teamed up with Sam Raimi to launch a new first-run syndicated series, &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;, based on Terry Goodkind&#x27;s &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; novel series. Another gap in first-run scripted series in syndication followed for four years after &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot; was canceled in 2009, until Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media (a company that mainly distributes programs for off-network syndication) began producing &quot;SAF3&quot; (pronounced &quot;safe&quot;) in 2013.

====Animated series====

During the late 1970s and 1980s, independent stations signed on in mid-sized and many small markets. The market for made-for-television cartoons grew as a result to include a branch for such stations. It usually had a greater artistic freedom, and looser standards (not mandated by a network). The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first-run syndicated cartoons such as &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and reruns of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, among many others.

Syndication was also important for the nascent anime community in the United States, with imports like &quot;Speed Racer&quot; and &quot;Star Blazers&quot; (a localized edit of &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;) helping to grow interest in Japanese animation. This led to the establishment of companies dedicated to importing and translating anime such as Streamline Pictures and Viz Media towards the end of the 1980s.

In 1987, The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication; &quot;DuckTales&quot; premiered that September and would eventually last for 100 episodes. The success of &quot;DuckTales&quot; paved the way for a second series two years later, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;. The following year, the two shows aired together under the umbrella block &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;. In the fall of 1990, Disney added another hour to &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;; the block continued in syndication, running additional first-run animated series until 1999.

These cartoons initially competed with the ones that were nationally televised on the broadcast networks. In the 1980s, national broadcast networks only aired cartoons on Saturday mornings, not competing with the weekday and Sunday syndication blocks aired by local independent stations; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then The WB launched their own weekday afternoon children&#x27;s program blocks. By the end of the 1990s, both syndication distributors and broadcast networks ended up losing most of their children&#x27;s market to the rise of cable television channels aimed at that audience such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, which provided appealing children&#x27;s entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.

Syndication remains a method of choice for distributing children&#x27;s programming, although this has gradually shifted to only produce programs to satisfy the federally mandated &quot;regulations on children&#x27;s television programming in the United States&quot; (E/I) rule imposed in the late 1990s as part of an amendment to the Children&#x27;s Television Act of 1990 that requires stations to air three hours of educational children&#x27;s programs every week, regardless of the station&#x27;s format. Syndication is generally a less expensive option for a local station than to attempt to produce its own locally originated E/I programming; not all networks provide their own E/I programs, so stations that are affiliated with networks that do not carry children&#x27;s program blocks acquire E/I programs off the syndication market to fulfill the requirements.

====News programming and late-night talk shows====
Also in the 1980s, news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations. &quot;Independent Network News&quot;, which was produced by WPIX in New York City, was a half-hour nightly program that ran from 1980 to 1990 on independent stations (in some markets, &quot;INN&quot; was paired with a locally produced primetime newscast); CNN would offer a simulcast of programming from its sister network Headline News (now HLN) to broadcast stations later, as did its rival All News Channel, although both were used mainly to fill overnight time periods and were effectively discontinued in syndication when All News Channel folded in 2002 and HLN launched a &quot;Headline Prime&quot; talk show block in 2006. In 2019, NewsNet began offering a similar service to its affiliates. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; began its long and continuing run as a &quot;soft&quot; news daily strip, with a number of imitations following (among which have included such entertainment news shows as &quot;TMZ on TV&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot; and &quot;ET&quot;″s own spin-off &quot;The Insider&quot;); and &quot;tabloid&quot; television, in the wake of ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; and, more immediately, 20th Television&#x27;s &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, would become a syndication staple with such series as &quot;Hard Copy&quot; and &quot;Real TV&quot;.

Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was with late-night talk shows; &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; was the only very successful one (it would be canceled after five years in 1994 due to ratings declines spurred by many CBS affiliates pushing the show to later timeslots following the debut of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and was later revived in 2013), but similar programs were attempted such as Alan Thicke&#x27;s earlier short-lived &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;, Lauren Hutton&#x27;s innovatively shot &quot;Lauren Hutton and...&quot;, and talk shows hosted by Dennis Miller, Whoopi Goldberg, David Brenner and Keenen Ivory Wayans; Magic Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Hour&quot; was seen as a massive flop, similar to &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;. The popularity of syndicated talk shows fell dramatically in the mid-1990s as network and cable offerings expanded in the wake of Johnny Carson&#x27;s retirement.

====Reality and live-action children&#x27;s shows====
Long before their popularity on network television from the 2000s onward, reality competition shows in one form or another, such as &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, enjoyed popularity in syndication as early as the mid-1980s. Since the now-defunct networks UPN and The WB began offering their affiliates additional nights of prime time programming in the late 1990s, there have been fewer first-run scripted series in syndication, at least, in the U.S.; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the 1950s and various producers in the early 1970s. The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators (particularly when they might be sold, with somewhat less risk, to cable channels); &quot;reality&quot; series such as &quot;Cheaters&quot; and &quot;Maximum Exposure&quot; and several dating series began to be more common in the early 2000s. Some of the more low-key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children, such as &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Sing Me A Story with Belle&quot;, &quot;Animal Rescue&quot; and &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s Animal Adventures&quot;. They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforcement of rules on children&#x27;s television programming.

====Game shows====
Several game shows are currently syndicated; historically, the most popular have been &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and the current version of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, both created by television personality Merv Griffin, respectively premiering in 1983 and 1984. The shows have been No. 1 and No. 2 or No. 1 to No. 3 in the syndication ratings consistently since at least the late 1980s. In fact, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, &quot;Wheel&quot; is the most popular syndicated television program both within and outside the United States. &quot;Family Feud&quot;, created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, ended its first syndication run in 1985. Three years later, a revival of the program featuring Ray Combs as host became a moderate hit and continued for seven seasons, its last year featuring the return of original host Richard Dawson in a failed attempt to save the series. A third revival hit the airwaves in 1999 and has gone through four hosts. The first three hosts (Louie Anderson, Richard Karn and John O&#x27;Hurley) struggled in their respective runs and only lasted three to four years. The current run of the program, hosted by Steve Harvey, has been a major ratings success; on the week of June 12, 2015, for the first time ever, &quot;Family Feud&quot; was the highest-rated syndicated program in terms of average household ratings.

While the current version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (another Goodson-Todman game show) has enjoyed tremendous success on the CBS daytime schedule since its inception in 1972 under hosts Bob Barker and Drew Carey, it has also produced three spinoffs, two of which failed after one season. The most successful syndicated edition was the 1972–80 weekly version that was initially hosted by Dennis James, but in 1977, daytime host Bob Barker also hosted the nighttime version for the final three seasons. For the 1985–86 season, Tom Kennedy hosted a daily syndicated version, and in 1994–95, Doug Davidson emceed his own daily syndicated version, titled &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;. Unlike the daytime series, which expanded to its current one-hour length in 1975, the syndicated versions of &quot;Price&quot; were 30 minutes long. A &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; revival also thrived beginning in 1998 under host Tom Bergeron, running six seasons until its 2004 cancellation. By far the most successful entry into the market in the 2000s has been the daily version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, which premiered in September 2002 and was canceled in May 2019 after 17 seasons in syndication (and a total run of 20 seasons dating back to the show&#x27;s premiere in August 1999).

Because game shows are very inexpensive to produce, with many episodes completed each day of production, successful ones are very profitable; for example, in 1988 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; cost an estimated $5 million to produce but earned almost $50 million in revenue. New game show concepts (that is, not based on an existing or pre-existing format) are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication; somewhat of an exception to this was &quot;Street Smarts&quot;, which lasted from 2001 to 2006 (despite the series airing in late night slots in many markets). Between 2003 and 2007, no new game shows debuted in syndication, marking four consecutive seasons where no new shows with that genre debuted, a syndication first. That streak ended with the fall 2007 debuts of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Merv Griffin&#x27;s Crosswords&quot;, bringing the daytime tally to six game shows; both ended production after one year, though &quot;Crosswords&quot; aired in reruns in some cities during the 2008–09 season before those reruns moved exclusively to cable.

More new shows were added for the 2008–09 fall season, including a daytime run of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (which featured certain elements that differed from the show&#x27;s franchised format, most notably with prospective players instead of models holding briefcases that held the monetary amounts) and an adaptation of the popular board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. While &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; caught on and was renewed for the 2009–2010 season, &quot;Trivial Pursuit: America Plays&quot; suffered low ratings throughout its run and was canceled.

For the 2009–2010 season, the Fox game show &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot; moved to syndication with a new, less expensive format. &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; followed for the 2010–2011 season. &quot;Deal&quot;, suffering from falling ratings, was canceled in February 2010, with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year; it would later be revived by CNBC in 2018. &quot;5th Grader&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; were canceled the following year for the same reason (although &quot;5th Grader&quot; would later be revived by Fox and Nickelodeon on two different occasions). Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show &quot;Cash Cab&quot; began airing in syndication in January 2011. Reruns of the GSN dating game show &quot;Baggage&quot; first aired in syndication as a test run in early 2011 on stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which preceded its full launch into other markets in fall 2012; although it was removed from syndication after one season.

The 2014–15 season saw the introduction of &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;, hosted by former &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; host Craig Ferguson; the series was renewed for a second season in January 2015, while Ferguson would also win a Daytime Emmy Award for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for his work on the program. In January 2016, Fox owned-and-operated stations began a test run of &quot;South of Wilshire&quot;—a game show produced by TMZ. The 2017 summer season includes the game show &quot;iWitness&quot; created by TV judge Judith Sheindlin. 2021 saw the debut of a revival of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; that reunited host Jay Leno and sidekick Kevin Eubanks from their time on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;; it ran two seasons, before Leno left during the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. 2022 saw the debut of a televised edition of the hit board game &quot;Pictionary&quot;, and 2023 saw the debut of two new games, &quot;Person, Place or Thing&quot; and &quot;Who the Bleep Is That&quot;. &quot;Who the Bleep Is That&quot; was cancelled in January 2024, while &quot;Pictionary&quot; and &quot;Person, Place or Thing&quot; were both cancelled in January 2025.

====Stripped talk shows====
The dominant form of first-run syndication in the U.S. for the last three decades has been the &quot;stripping&quot; (or &quot;strip&quot;) talk show, such as &quot;Donahue&quot;, &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot;, and &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;. Strip programming is a technique used for scheduling television and radio programming to ensure consistency and coherency. Strip programming is used to deliver consistent content to targeted audiences. Broadcasters know or predict the times at which certain demographics will be listening to or watching their programs and play them at that time.

As with game shows, talk shows are inexpensive to produce and very profitable if successful. They have a disadvantage in that their costs can be higher than some other formats due to the high volume of episodes needed. In many markets, a stripped show will be seen twice daily, usually with different episodes (one being a more recent episode and the other being an episode from a previous season). Sometimes, station groups with more than one station in a market, or a &quot;duopoly&quot;, will run one episode of a strip on one of their stations in the morning, and the other available episode on another of their stations that night.

Meanwhile, the popularity of some of the audience-participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants, some of whom, such as Morton Downey Jr. and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence; others, such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich, have a sustained run. A notable scheduling decision was made by KRON-TV in San Francisco: a 2000 dispute with NBC led to that station&#x27;s disaffiliation from that network after 52 years, and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco, KRON decided to become one of the largest commercial independent stations by market size on the VHF band in the U.S., and soon tried running &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey-associate Dr. Phil McGraw, in primetime, with impressive ratings results.

With a general decline in first-run production in the 2020s, syndicators and stations have turned to reruns of stripped talk shows to fill time slots, with observers noting that conflict-driven tabloid shows tend to draw higher ratings in reruns than non-tabloid shows.

===2000s===

First-run syndicated shows in the United States include talk shows (e.g., &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, &quot;The Real&quot;, &quot;The Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; &amp; &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;); tabloid/newsmagazine shows (e.g., &quot;TMZ Live&quot;); crime/law enforcement shows (e.g., &quot;Crime Watch Daily&quot;); game shows (e.g., &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Funny You Should Ask&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;); court shows (e.g., &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, &quot;Judge Jerry&quot;, &quot;Judge Faith&quot;, &quot;Protection Court&quot;, &quot;Hot Bench&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Court with Judge Ross&quot;, and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;); and sitcoms (e.g., &quot;The First Family&quot;).

==Influence on television schedules==
The emergence of barter syndication in the 1980s caused the number of independent stations to grow from fewer than 100 in 1980 to 328 , as they did not need cash for programming. With the loosening of FCC regulations and the creation of new additional broadcast networks (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV), most of these independents have joined one or another of these or smaller (religious or low-budget) networks.

In other cases, like those of KCAL-TV in Los Angeles, KMCI-TV in Lawrence-Kansas City and WMLW-TV in Racine-Milwaukee, those independent stations are used to complement their network-affiliated sister station (respectively in the mentioned cases, KCBS-TV, KSHB-TV and WDJT-TV) by allowing a duopoly control of more syndicated programming than would be possible on one station (and to spread it throughout the schedule of the two stations, often several times a day), or to air news programming in times unavailable on the larger network station, along with fulfilling network and syndicated programming commitments, which allows popular or network programming to be moved to the independent stations due to breaking news or sports commitments without the traditional inconvenience of a late night or weekend airing of the pre-empted show. A duopoly of a network-affiliated and independent station also allows a network station to move a low-rated syndicated program to their sister independent station to stem revenue losses.

==Off-network syndication==
Off-network syndication occurs when a network television series is syndicated in packages containing some or all episodes, and sold to as many television stations and markets as possible to be used in local programming timeslots. In this manner, sitcoms are preferred and more successful because they are less serialized, and can be run non-sequentially, which is more beneficial and less costly for the station. In the United States, local stations now rarely broadcast reruns of primetime dramas (or simply air them primarily on weekends); instead, they usually air on basic cable channels, which may air each episode 30 to 60 times.

Syndication rights typically last for six consecutive showings of a series within three to five years; if a program continues to perform well enough in broadcast or cable syndication during the initial cycle, television stations or cable networks can opt to renew an off-network program for an additional cycle.

Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its network run. The best known example of this is the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969, gaining only modest ratings, but became a worldwide phenomenon after it entered off-network syndication. Its success in syndication led to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and the later versions in the franchise.

It is common for long-running series to have early seasons syndicated while the series itself is still in first-run network production. To differentiate between new and rebroadcast content, until the 1980s it was not uncommon for series to be syndicated under a different title than that used in their original broadcast run. Examples include &quot;Bonanza&quot; (which was syndicated as &quot;Ponderosa&quot;), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (as &quot;Marshal Dillon&quot;, a title still used to differentiate reruns from the early, half-hour episodes of the show from the later one-hour episodes), &quot;Emergency!&quot; (as &quot;Emergency One&quot;), &quot;Ironside&quot; (as &quot;The Raymond Burr Show&quot;), &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (as &quot;McGarrett&quot;), &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (as &quot;M*A*S*H 4077th&quot;), &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (as &quot;Robert Young, Family Doctor&quot;), &quot;CHiPs&quot; (as &quot;CHiPs Patrol&quot;), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (as &quot;Happy Days Again&quot;), and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (as &quot;Andy of Mayberry&quot;).

Syndication of older episodes can also increase exposure for a television show that is still airing first-run network episodes. In the case of the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, its syndication, particularly on TBS, is one of the reasons attributed for a rise in first-run ratings for its sixth season. The sixth-season episode &quot;The Bakersfield Expedition&quot;, for example, was the first episode of that series to attract 20 million viewers.

===Strip/daily syndication===
Off-network syndication can take several forms. The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication, when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week in the same time slot. In the 1960s and 1970s, independent stations with no news departments began viewing strip syndication as a necessary means of obtaining effective counterprogramming to the local news programs airing on network affiliates. Typically, this means that enough episodes must exist (88 episodes, or four seasons, is the usual minimum, though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes) to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months, without episodes being repeated. However, there are exceptions, such as the 65-episode block (common in children&#x27;s programming), which allows for a 13-week cycle of daily showings, so there will only be four repeats in a year.

In some cases, more than one episode is shown daily. Half-hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes, taking up one or two hours of broadcast time. If a series is not strip syndicated, it may be aired once a week, instead of five times a week. This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication, but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching. More often, hour-long dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly; sitcoms are more likely to get stripped. In recent years, there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time (generally following the local news). This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many previous episodes available.

As with commercial stations, not all the airtime nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U.S. public-broadcasting stations by PBS; additionally, there are some independent public television stations in the U.S. which take no programming from that (somewhat) decentralized network. As a result, there are several syndicators of programming for the non-profit stations, several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some, not all, of their functions into the creation of PBS in 1969. American Public Television (APT) is the largest of these, nearly matched by the National Educational Telecommunications Association (NETA, a merger of Southern Educational Communications Association and the Pacific Mountain Network). The now defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator-descendants (of the Northeastern, Southeastern, and Rocky Mountain educational networks, respectively) of the pre-PBS era. Among the other notable organizations in the U.S. are Westlink Satellite Operations (based at Albuquerque&#x27;s KNME) and Executive Program Services.

Off-network syndication in its various forms, including Internet, international and traditional direct-to-station sales, constitute roughly half of an individual television program&#x27;s overall revenue stream, with the other half taken up by advertising.

==Monetary rates==

In 1993, Universal Television became one of the first studios to cash in on the cable trend, first selling repeats of &quot;Major Dad&quot; to USA Network in 1993 for $600,000 per episode, the first time a network program was exclusively sold to a cable network for its first run rights. Later it sold reruns of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; to A&amp;E for about $155,000 an episode; in 1996, the studio got $275,000 from USA Network for repeats of &quot;New York Undercover&quot;, a far less successful show. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; drew A&amp;E&#x27;s highest daytime ratings – one million viewers per episode.

Universal sold reruns of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; to USA Network for $300,000 each. And even long-forgotten shows can find new life: Paramount Network bought &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million. USA Network paid $750,000 for the rights to &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;; while USA&#x27;s reruns of the show drew an average of 2.3 million viewers – outstanding by cable standards – Perth says the show will need &quot;an enormous number of airings to have any sort of profitability.&quot;

===Dramatic reruns: rerun prices===

Not all programs in syndication are sold for a fee. Less popular programming may be distributed by &quot;barter&quot;, in which the syndicator, instead of selling the show to a station, offers the show for free, with the caveat that the station give up its advertising time on other shows to the syndicator&#x27;s advertisers. Barter syndication, in addition to the cost advantage, is popular because of its flexibility; a station can typically pick up a barter syndicated program for only a few weeks or months, without the long-term financial commitment of a traditional syndicated series, allowing the station to plug the show into its lineup to fill a hole in the schedule.

==Types of deals==
Cash deals are when a distributor offers a syndicated program to the highest bidder. A cash plus deal is when the distributor retains advertising space to offset some of the cost for the program. The station gets the program for a little less in exchange for some ad space for the producer.

Barter deals are usually for new untested shows or older shows. In this type of deal, distributors get a fraction of the advertisement revenue in exchange for their program. For example, in a 7/5 deal the producer gets seven minutes of advertising time, leaving five minutes for the station to insert local as well as national advertisements.

==Radio syndication==
Radio syndication generally works the same way as television syndication, except that radio stations usually are not organized into strict affiliate-only networks. Radio networks generally are only distributors of radio shows, and individual stations (though often owned by large conglomerates) decide which shows to carry from a wide variety of networks and independent radio providers. As a result, radio networks such as Westwood One or Premiere Networks, despite their influence in broadcasting, are not as recognized among the general public as television networks like CBS or ABC (many of these distributors ally themselves with television networks; Westwood One, for instance, is allied with NBC News, while Premiere is allied with Fox). Some examples of widely syndicated commercial broadcasting music programs include weekly countdowns like Rick Dees&#x27; &quot;Weekly Top 40&quot;, the &quot;American Top 40&quot;, &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; with Kix Brooks, &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 20 Countdown&quot;, the &quot;Canadian Hit 30 Countdown&quot; and the nightly program, &quot;Delilah&quot;, heard on many U.S. stations.

Syndication is particularly popular in talk radio. While syndicated music shows (with the exception of some evening and overnight shows such as &quot;Delilah&quot; mentioned above) tend to air once a week and are mostly recorded, most popular talk radio programs are syndicated daily and are broadcast live. Also, with relatively few 24-hour live talk radio networks (though this, in recent times, has been changing), most radio stations are free to assemble their own lineup of talk show hosts as they so choose. Examples of syndicated talk programs are Premiere Networks&#x27; &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot;, Dial Global&#x27;s &quot;The Jim Bohannon Show&quot;, and the self-syndicated &quot;The Dave Ramsey Show&quot; (more recently, talk networks such as Talk Radio Network have been marketing and packaging all-day lineups, marking a departure from the syndication model; as such, popular shows such as Cumulus Media Networks&#x27; &quot;The Savage Nation&quot; and Premiere&#x27;s &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; now air as part of a broader network lineup in many markets, particularly on Premiere owned-and-operated stations, though they continue to be syndicated to non-network stations as well). Talk syndication tends to be more prevalent because voice tracking, a practice used by many music stations to have disc jockeys host multiple supposedly local shows at once, is not feasible with live talk radio.

National Public Radio, Public Radio International, and American Public Media all sell programming to local member stations in the U.S., most of which are subsidized through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting but operated by private nonprofit organizations, universities, state or local governments. This is in contrast to centralized public radio networks in other countries (such as Canada&#x27;s CBC, Australia&#x27;s ABC and the United Kingdom&#x27;s BBC) that own and operate all of their stations as arms of the national government and run them as a strict network (from 1948 to 2013, the United States had a strict anti-propaganda law, the Smith–Mundt Act, that prohibited broadcasting government-owned networks such as Voice of America to American audiences. The law was mostly repealed in 2013, but distribution of VOA or other federally produced radio programming is still rare). Two independently produced, non-commercial syndicated programs, heard on hundreds of community radio and indie radio stations, are &quot;Alternative Radio&quot; and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;. Some (in fact, most) radio programs are also offered on a barter system usually at no charge to the radio station. The system is used for live programming or preproduced programs and include a mixture of ad time sold by the program producer as well as time set aside for the radio station to sell.

===History===
Before radio networks matured in the United States, some early radio shows were reproduced on transcription disks and mailed to individual stations. An example of syndication using this method was RadiOzark Enterprises, Inc. based in Springfield, Missouri, co-owned with KWTO. The Assembly of God, with national headquarters in Springfield, sponsored a half-hour program on the station called &quot;Sermons in Song.&quot; RadiOzark began transcribing the show for other stations in the 1940s, and eventually 200 stations carried the program. The company later produced country music programs starring among others, Smiley Burnette, George Morgan, Bill Ring and Tennessee Ernie Ford (260 15-minute episodes of &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Show&quot; were distributed), and more than 1,200 U.S. and Canadian stations aired the programs. Many syndicated radio programs were distributed through the U.S. mail or another delivery service, although the medium changed as technology developed, going from transcription disks to phonograph records, tape recordings, cassette tapes and eventually CDs. Many smaller weekend programs still use this method to this day, though with the rise of the Internet, many stations have since opted to distribute programs via CD-quality MP3s through FTP downloads.

It was not until the advent of communications satellite in the 1980s that live syndication became popular (though it could be transmitted through network lines, it was not particularly common because of cost, network congestion and quality issues). Since then, most syndicated radio programs are distributed using satellite subcarrier audio technology. Shortly after satellite networks such as RKO, Transtar, and SMN began, the Fairness Doctrine was repealed, which is credited with helping Rush Limbaugh become the first national talk radio superstar. At the same time, the FCC began issuing more FM broadcasting licenses to suburban and rural areas in the late 1980s, which allowed more room for music stations on the FM dial; radio formats such as country music that were traditionally AM fixtures even after most pop and rock music moved to FM were now moving to FM as well, leaving much more room for talk formats on the AM dial. As the 1990s went on, Laura Schlessinger and Howard Stern began their national shows, rising to become national icons. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which led to significant concentration of media ownership, facilitated the rapid deployment of both existing and new syndicated programs in the late 1990s, putting syndication on par with, and eventually surpassing, the network radio format.

After the September 11 attacks, syndicated talk radio saw a notably rapid rise in popularity, as networks rushed new national shows into syndication to meet the demand for discussion of national issues. Many of these, such as Laura Ingraham, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, were mostly supportive of the actions of the Republican-led government; a few others, such as Alex Jones, were openly critical of the government&#x27;s actions and motives. After the Democrats took control in the late 2000s, the gap between the two styles narrowed due to the mutual opposition of both camps to the government&#x27;s actions, which allowed Jones greater clearance on stations.

In contrast to conservative talk radio, which has predominantly been driven by syndication, progressive talk radio has almost always been a network-driven model. The incompatibility of conservative and progressive ideologies and the lack of syndicated progressive hosts required solutions that could produce all-day programming to individual stations. It was not until Air America Radio launched in 2004 that progressive talk would become viable; though it failed several years later, Dial Global now carries a network slate that is carried on most progressive talk stations. Sports radio is likewise mostly a network phenomenon, partially because the irregular nature of sports pre-emptions makes having a full-time network to be able to cut into and join in progress at any time highly convenient. Syndicated radio is not as popular in other parts of the world. Canada has a few independently syndicated shows, but the bulk of syndicated content there comes from the United States, and the sum total of syndicated programming is far less than most American stations, as Canadian stations rely more heavily on local content. Most other countries still follow the network radio model.

==International syndication==
Syndication also applies to international markets. Same language countries often syndicate programs to each other – such as programs from the United Kingdom being syndicated to Australia and vice versa. Another example would be programs from the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina being syndicated to local television stations in the United States, and programs from the United States being syndicated elsewhere in the world. One of the best-known internationally syndicated television series has been &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, which was produced by Grade&#x27;s British ITV franchise company ATV at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, and was shown around the world, including the United States, where it aired in syndication (including the owned-and-operated stations of CBS), and Canada, where CBC Television aired the show. The 1970s was a time when many British comedies, including &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; were syndicated to the United States and worldwide. Many soaps and long-running series are also successfully syndicated around the globe.

The television show &quot;&quot; earned $1.6 million per episode in its first cycle in cable syndication. There were many different versions of the show making it an international success. It was already popular in the U.S., so becoming a success internationally as well as within the U.S. made syndication sensible. Whether a series is produced in the U.S. or not is based on the economic value and potential viability of its sales internationally with the possibility of syndication.

Economic factors that influence production outside the U.S. play a major role in deciding if a television show will be syndicated, internally and internationally. International syndication has sustained a growing of prosperity and monetary value amongst the distributors who sell to them. Due to a rise in competition, syndicators have upheld high standards for different countries to buy the rights to distribute shows. During the 1990s poor ratings were common amongst syndicated shows, but distributors still made it possible for international competition to happen and buy U.S. shows. Colombian, Brazilian, Mexican and Venezuelan telenovelas are programmed throughout the Portuguese and Spanish-speaking world, and in many parts of India, Philippines, China and Europe, while Turkish television drama is broadcast in the Balkans, some other European countries, Western and Central Asia and North Africa.

===U.S.-style syndication internationally===
Because of the structural differences discussed above, there are presently very few areas where a true U.S.-style syndication model operates, whereby programs are sold on a per-area basis (within a single country) to local or regional stations with differing (or no) network affiliations. Canada was historically one of the few exceptions. Until the mid-1990s, television stations in Canada, like those in the U.S., were typically run as separate local operations, with a small number of moderately sized ownership groups such as Baton, Canwest, WIC, and CHUM. Those stations that were affiliated with a national network, i.e. CBC or CTV, did not always receive a full schedule of programming from that network.

At this time, it was not uncommon for U.S. syndicators to treat Canada as an extension of their domestic syndication operations, for both their first-run and off-network offerings. This is still the case for American radio programs; Canadian radio networks are not assembled as rigidly into networks (except for the CBC&#x27;s radio division). However, an alternate form of first-run syndication was performed by some domestic broadcasters: as the Canadian rights to U.S. primetime series were often acquired by individual station groups (as opposed to full-fledged national networks), they would in turn resell local rights for those programs to stations in areas where they did not operate. A few of Canada&#x27;s independent stations, most notably CHCH-TV and CITY-TV, also resyndicated their own locally produced programs to other television stations. Unlike in the United States, however, few Canadian programs were ever created solely for syndication without officially belonging to at least one specific station or network; those that did exist were intended primarily to be syndicated into the American system, and even those were typically distributed in Canada as &quot;network&quot; programs rather than being sold to individual stations.

Since the late 1990s, as most stations have been consolidated into national networks consisting almost entirely of owned-and-operated stations and with full-day network schedules, both types of syndication have largely disappeared from the Canadian broadcast landscape. Programs that are sold in syndication in the U.S. are now generally sold to Canadian media groups to air across all their properties, with per-market sales now being very rare. For example, American shows that air in syndication in the United States, such as &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; or &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, air in Canada as core parts of the CTV Television Network schedule. &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; appears to have been the last significant holdout to this model, having aired primarily on CTV stations, but in some markets airing instead on a Global station, and even some CBC affiliates.

One syndication service remains in Canada, Yes TV, which serves the few remaining independent stations in the country with mostly American programs (&quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; are currently syndicated in Canada through Yes TV). These independent stations can also secure deals with American syndicators; CHCH, for example, has a direct deal with 20th Television to carry some of that company&#x27;s classic sitcoms, including those from the MTM Enterprises library. They were also, in 1986, largely involved in production of the final incarnation of &quot;Split Second&quot; game show, which was syndicated in U.S. by Viacom.

==Regional syndication==
There are three key reasons why a radio station will decide to pick up a syndicated show – the program is unique and has difficult to replicate content, has a decent ratings track record or offers a celebrity host. New developing radio programs are generally able to claim one of these attributes, but not all three. Regional syndication attempts to replace these benchmark attributes with other benefits that are generally recognized by the industry as also being important. Given the financial downturn within the industry, the need for quality cost effective locally relevant programming is greater than ever before. Programs that offer regionally specific content while providing the economic benefits of syndication can be especially appealing to potential affiliates. Regional syndication can also be more attractive to area advertisers who share a common regional trading area versus assembling a radio network of stations that hopscotch across the United States.

<text>The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) is a inland waterway along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, running from Massachusetts southward along the Atlantic Seaboard and around the southern tip of Florida, then following the Gulf Coast to Brownsville, Texas. Some sections of the waterway consist of natural inlets, saltwater rivers, bays, and sounds, while others are artificial canals. It provides a navigable route along its length without many of the hazards of travel on the open sea.

==Context and early history==
Since the coastline represented the national border, and commerce of the time was chiefly by water, the fledgling United States government established a degree of national control over it. Inland transportation to supply the coasting trade at the time was less known and virtually undeveloped, but when new lands and their favorable river systems were added with the Northwest Territory in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance established a radically new and free national policy for their development and transportation use. 

Over time, internal improvements of natural coastal and inland waterways would develop into the Great Loop, which allows for waterborne circumnavigation of the eastern continental United States, using minimal ocean travel, with the Intracoastal Waterway providing its eastern end. In 1808, the first federal government report on existing, possible, and likely avenues of transportation improvement was presented; it included much of the distance where the ICW now traverses the Atlantic coast. At the request of the Senate, Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin presented an overall plan for future transportation developments of national importance and scope. Along with inland east–west improvements, Gallatin&#x27;s north–south improvements included the following:

While Gallatin discussed the details of engineering, construction, and costs, including the national benefits to accrue from lowered transportation costs between domestic and international markets, his full $20 million, 10-year plan was never approved. That is not to say his plan was never implemented, however, for with experience in the War of 1812 shortly thereafter and the attendant British blockade, the continued need for such facility was soon highlighted. Since Gallatin had based his proposals on the known advantageous natural geographic features of the country, many of his proposals became the locations of navigation improvements that were surveyed, authorized, and constructed starting with the 1824 General Survey Act and the first of many pieces of rivers and harbors legislation, as well by individual state-built improvements.

Since these 1824 acts, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has responsibility for navigation waterway improvements and maintenance. All four proposed sections of Gallatin&#x27;s intracoastal plan were eventually built; the Delaware and Raritan Canal was later abandoned for a better alternative, but the Cape Cod Canal remains in operation, and the Delaware and the Dismal Swamp portions still form part of the larger present-day Intracoastal Waterway.

==19th-century growth==
In 1826, Congress authorized the first survey for an inland canal between the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. After the Civil War, government funding shifted from waterways to railroads; still, coastal improvements authorized for development included the Houston Ship Channel and the Delaware River in 1872. The following year, the Senate&#x27;s Select Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard looked at the need for more haulage capacity to move freight to the coasts. But their &quot;Report of Windom Select Committee&quot; their plans and recommendations &quot;received less attention than was anticipated, of course by reason of the rapid growth of interest in railways&quot;.

In the River and Harbors Appropriations Acts of 1882 and 1884, Congress signaled its intent to improve waterways to benefit the nation by promoting competition among transportation modes. The 1882 act was the first act of Congress to combine appropriations for development of the nation&#x27;s waterways with a reaffirmation of the policy of freedom from tolls and other user charges, first stated in 1787; it was passed over President Chester Arthur&#x27;s veto, who considered it a waste of the federal government&#x27;s growing budget surplus. In 1887, the Interstate Commerce Act established federal regulation of railroads; Congress continued to promote freedom from tolls or special taxes on waterways. In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first federal statute to limit cartels and monopolies, but the federal government used it minimally until Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency more than 10 years later.

Continued insufficient capacity of railroad transportation became apparent following the harvest of 1906.

==20th-century developments==
The invention of the diesel engine in 1892 eventually led to the conversion of fuels for transportation from coal and steam to diesel and the internal combustion engine. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1909 set national policy for an intracoastal waterway from Boston to the Rio Grande, and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1910 authorized a channel on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway between the Apalachicola River and St. Andrews Bay, Florida (completed in 1936), as well as a study of the most efficient means to move cargo. Between 1910 and 1914, navigation channels were deepened, and the screw propeller proved efficient for improved steering and flanking qualities. The Panama Canal Act was passed in 1911, which proved key to the revival of waterway transportation in the United States, because the opening of Panama Canal in 1914 allowed coastal shipping to extend to the U.S. West Coast for the first time. The law also prohibited railroads from owning, controlling, or operating a water carrier through the canal and led to succeeding legislation that eliminated monopoly of transportation modes by railroads. The country&#x27;s World War I experience demonstrated the need for bulk cargo transportation, with Congress establishing the federal barge lines and spurring development of cheaper ways to transport farm commodities, including the first use of standardized freight barges.

In 1924, Congress incorporated the Inland Waterways Corporation, generally regarded as the beginning of modern water carrier operations, and in 1925, it authorized construction of the Louisiana and Texas Intracoastal Waterway, as well as surveys east of New Orleans to Apalachicola Bay; this was the first legislation to treat the ICW as a continuous whole. The River and Harbor Act of 1927 authorized the portion of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, using the route planned out by the Jacksonville District of the Corps of Engineers. During World War II, the need for efficient transportation of bulk materials within the continental United States was well demonstrated after German submarines sank numerous merchant ships off the East Coast. By 1942, the ICW channel was completed between New Orleans and Corpus Christi.

Today, federal law provides for the waterway to be maintained at a minimum depth of for most of its length, but inadequate funding has prevented that. Consequently, for larger ships, shoaling or shallow waters are encountered along several sections of the waterway, with these having or minimum depths from earlier improvements. While no tolls are charged for waterway usage, commercial users have been charged a fuel tax since 1978, which is used to maintain and improve facilities. That year, the Inland Waterways Revenue Act imposed a barge fuel tax; originally set at 4 cents per gallon in 1980, it was gradually raised to 10 cents per gallon by 1986. To hold these funds, the act also created the Inland Waterways Trust Fund under the U.S. Treasury, which are used to cover half the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of the inland waterways infrastructure (33 U.S.C. ch.32). The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 was a wide-ranging bill regarding all water resources utilization nationally. Concerning transportation on waterways, this law established the Inland Waterways Users Board to make recommendations regarding construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for the inland waterways, and also gradually increased the incremental fuel tax to 20 cents per gallon by 1995.

==Current route==

The Intracoastal Waterway runs for most of the length of the Eastern Seaboard. The waterway consists of three non-contiguous segments: from Brownsville, Texas, east to Carrabelle, Florida; from Tarpon Springs, Florida, south to Fort Myers, Florida; and from Key West, Florida, north to Portsmouth, Virginia (milepost 0.0). The first and second sections are collectively referred to as the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and the third is referred to as the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AIWW). The first and second sections were intended to be connected via a dredged waterway from Tarpon Springs to St. Marks, Florida (which is near Carrabelle), and the second and third sections were intended to be connected via the Cross Florida Barge Canal across northern Florida. These projects were never completed because of environmental concerns. Additional canals and bays extend a navigable waterway north of Portsmouth. Its unofficial northern terminus is the Manasquan River in New Jersey, where it connects with the Atlantic Ocean at the Manasquan Inlet. North of that is its official terminus point, the Annisquam River, a U.S. Army Corps maintained channel 26 miles (42 km) northeast of Boston, Massachusetts, connecting Annisquam and Gloucester, Massachusetts.

The Intracoastal Waterway sees a large amount of commercial activity: barges haul petroleum, petroleum products, foodstuffs, building materials, and manufactured goods. It is also used extensively by recreational boaters. On the east coast, some of the traffic in fall and spring is by snowbirds who regularly move south in winter and north in summer. The waterway is also used when the ocean is too rough for travel. Numerous inlets connect the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico with the Intracoastal Waterway. The Intracoastal Waterway connects to several navigable rivers where shipping traffic can travel to inland ports, including the Mississippi, Alabama, Savannah, James, Delaware, Hudson, and Connecticut rivers. The St. Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes can be accessed via connections with the Hudson River and Erie Canal, and via the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and Cal-Sag Channel.

<doc id="327788" wikidata="Q1155596" url="?curid=327788" title="Print syndication">
<text>Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, political cartoons, comic strips and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites. The syndicates offer reprint rights and grant permissions to other parties for republishing content of which they own and/or represent copyrights. Other terms for the service include a newspaper syndicate, a press syndicate, and a feature syndicate.

The syndicate is an agency that offers features from notable journalists and authorities as well as reliable and established cartoonists. It fills a need among smaller weekly and daily newspapers for material that helps them compete with large urban papers, at a much lesser cost than if the client were to purchase the material themselves. Generally, syndicates sell their material to one client in each territory. News agencies differ in that they distribute news articles to all interested parties.

Typical syndicated features are advice columns (parenting, health, finance, gardening, cooking, etc.), humor columns, editorial opinion, critic&#x27;s reviews, and gossip columns. Some syndicates specialize in one type of feature, such as comic strips.

==Comic strip syndication==

A comic strip syndicate functions as an agent for cartoonists and comic strip creators, placing the cartoons and strips in as many newspapers as possible on behalf of the artist. In some cases, the work will be owned by the syndicate as opposed to the creator. A syndicate can annually receive thousands of submissions from which only two or three might be selected for representation.

The leading strip syndicates include Andrews McMeel Syndication, King Features Syndicate, and Creators Syndicate, with the Tribune Content Agency and The Washington Post Writers Group also in the running.

== Editorial cartoon syndication ==
Syndication of editorial cartoons has an important impact on the form, since cartoons about local issues or politicians are not of interest to the national market. Therefore, an artist who contracts with a syndicate will either be one who already focuses their work on national and global issues, or will shift focus accordingly.

== History ==
An early version of syndication was practiced in the &quot;Journal of Occurrences&quot;, a series of newspaper articles published by an anonymous group of &quot;patriots&quot; in 1768–1769 in the &quot;New York Journal and Packet&quot; and other newspapers, chronicling the occupation of Boston by the British Army.

According to historian Elmo Scott Watson, true print syndication began in 1841 with a two-page supplement produced by &quot;New York Sun&quot; publisher Moses Yale Beach and sold to a score of newspapers in the U.S. northeast.

By the end of the Civil War, three syndicates were in operation, selling news items and short fiction pieces. By 1881, Associated Press correspondent Henry Villard was self-syndicating material to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot;, and the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. A few years later, the &quot;New York Sun&quot;&#x27;s Charles A. Dana formed a syndicate to sell the short stories of Bret Harte and Henry James.

The first full-fledged American newspaper syndicate was the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, launched in 1884 by publisher S. S. McClure. It was the first successful company of its kind, turning the marketing of columns, book serials (by the likes of Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle), and eventually comic strips, into a large industry.

Syndication properly took off in 1896 when the competitors the &quot;New York World&quot; and the &quot;New York Journal&quot; began producing Sunday comic pages. The daily comic strip came into practice in 1907, revolutionizing and expanding the syndication business. Syndicates began providing client newspaper with proof sheets of black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips.&quot;

By 1984, 300 syndicates were distributing 10,000 features with combined sales of $100 million a year.

With the 1960s advent of the underground press, associations like the Underground Press Syndicate, and later the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, worked together to syndicate material — including weekly comic strips — for each other&#x27;s publications.

<doc id="327789" wikidata="Q7888835" url="?curid=327789" title="2002 Arab League summit">
<text>The Beirut Summit (also known as the Arab Summit Conference) was a meeting of the Arab League in Beirut, Lebanon, in March 2002 to discuss the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. At the time Yasser Arafat, the Leader of Palestine, was under house-arrest in his Ramallah compound. The Israeli forces confined him and prevented him from attending the Beirut Summit. 

The meeting became especially noteworthy for the adoption, by the Arab states attending, of a proposal offering a comprehensive peace between the Arab countries and Israel, called the Arab Peace Initiative. 

==Arab Peace Initiative==

The Arab Peace Initiative was floated by then acting Saudi regent Crown Prince Abdullah as a potential solution to both the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Arab–Israeli conflict. It was published on March 28, 2002, during the meeting of the Arab League at the Beirut Summit and achieved the unanimous consent of all members of the Arab League. 

Considered as a progressive proposal, it calls for the state of Israel to withdraw all its forces from all the Occupied Territories, including the Golan Heights, to officially recognize &quot;an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital&quot; in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a &quot;just solution&quot; for the Palestinian refugees. In exchange the Arab states affirmed that they would recognize the state of Israel, consider the Arab-Israeli conflict over and establish &quot;normal relations&quot; with Israel. 

The initiative is based upon:
* The principle of land for peace. 
* The conviction of the Arab countries that a military solution to the conflict will not achieve peace or provide security for the parties.

The proposal, from Saudi Arabia, offered Israel recognition by the Arab countries, including into Peace agreements and normalization of relations if Israel would: 
* withdraw from all territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War, 
* provide a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem, and 
* recognize the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The goals of the initiative are:
* Full Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967.
* Implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. 
* The establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
* A just solution to the Palestinian Refugee problem, to be agreed upon in accordance with section 11 of UN General Assembly Resolution 194. 
* The normalization of relations in the context of a comprehensive Peace. 

Jordan&#x27;s Foreign Minister stated: 

The Arab initiative put forth at the Beirut Summit in March offers comprehensive peace in the region based on the internationally recognized formulation of &quot;land for peace&quot; – a return to June 4, 1967, borders in exchange for normal relations and a collective peace treaty. 

In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres welcomed it and said: &quot;... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya,&quot; referring to Netanya suicide attack perpetrated on previous evening which the Beirut Summit has failed to address. 

The somewhat obscure 4th section was inserted at Lebanese insistence and reflects its concern that the settlement of the refugee problem not be at what it considers the expense of Lebanon and its &quot;demographic balance.&quot; 

Lebanon and Syria campaigned for the inclusion of a reference to United Nations Resolution 194, which emphasizes the Palestinian right of return to Israel. A compromise was eventually reached, citing the resolution but stating that the League would support any agreement between Israel and Palestinians on the issue.

<doc id="327791" wikidata="Q4976597" url="?curid=327791" title="Brownlow's Whig">
<text>The Whig was a polemical American newspaper published and edited by William G. &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow (1805–1877) in the mid-nineteenth century. As its name implies, the paper&#x27;s primary purpose was the promotion and defense of Whig Party political figures and ideals. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the &quot;Whig&quot; became the mouthpiece for East Tennessee&#x27;s anti-secessionist movement. The &quot;Whig&quot; was published under several names throughout its existence, namely the &quot;Tennessee Whig&quot;, the &quot;Elizabethton Whig&quot;. the &quot;Jonesborough Whig&quot;, the &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot;, and similar variations.

The &quot;Whig&quot; was one of the most influential newspapers in nineteenth-century Tennessee, due mainly to Brownlow&#x27;s editorials, which often included vindictive personal attacks and fierce diatribes. A Methodist circuit rider by trade, Brownlow partnered with publisher Mason R. Lyon under a one-year contract and launched the &quot;Whig&quot; on May 4, 1839 to counter rising Democratic sentiment in the region. He quickly made many enemies across the majority Democratic antebellum South. During his career, Brownlow survived several assassination attempts, numerous libel lawsuits, and arrest and imprisonment by Confederate authorities during the American Civil War.

Brownlow&#x27;s &quot;Whig&quot; editorials attacked Democrats and Methodism&#x27;s two main competitors in East Tennessee: Baptists and Presbyterians. Brownlow also attacked groups who he believed supported Democrats, such as Catholics, Mormons, and immigrants. In spite of its anti-secessionist sentiments, the &quot;Whig&quot; was staunchly pro-slavery in the early days of the Civil War but, upon Brownlow&#x27;s return from exile in 1863, the paper adopted an abolitionist stance. After Brownlow was elected governor in 1865, his son became publisher of the &quot;Whig&quot;. In 1870, &quot;Whig&quot; reporter William Rule (1839–1928) launched the &quot;Knoxville Chronicle&quot; (later renamed &quot;Knoxville Journal&quot;), which is often considered the &quot;successor&quot; to the &quot;Whig&quot;.

==Layout and publication==

The &quot;Whig&quot; was a typical nineteenth-century broadsheet, usually containing four pages, each divided into five (later six) columns. Editorials and news typically occupied the first two-and-a-half pages, and advertisements occupied the last page-and-a-half. The first column often began with a song or poem, after which Brownlow launched into an editorial. Along with political and religious commentary, Brownlow also reported on his travels to various cities, dispensed advice on issues such as marriage and child-rearing, and published his own speeches in their entirety.

The masthead used for the first few issues included the phrase &quot;Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness&quot; from the Declaration of Independence, and was soon followed by the motto, &quot;Cry aloud, and spare not,&quot; taken from Isaiah 58:1 (KJV). The latter appeared in the paper&#x27;s nameplate as early as 1839, and was used throughout much of the 1840s. In 1853, Brownlow began using the motto, &quot;Independent in everything, neutral in nothing.&quot; For several months after the 1840 elections, the paper used Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s famous line, &quot;We have met the enemy, and they are ours,&quot; as its nameplate motto.

===Politics===

In an 1842 description of the &quot;Whig&quot;, Brownlow wrote, &quot;politically, we are WHIG— ultra whig, and of the old school— the &#x27;sworn and eternal foe of locofocoism.&#x27;&quot; Brownlow despised President Andrew Jackson, calling him the &quot;greatest curse that ever yet befell this nation.&quot; The &quot;Whig&quot; supported, among other things, a strong central government, federal funding for internal improvements, a weakened presidency, a national bank, and tariffs to protect American products from foreign competition.

As Brownlow&#x27;s political idol was Kentucky senator Henry Clay, the publisher pleaded with the Whig Party to make Clay its presidential candidate. He became disenchanted when the party snubbed Clay in favor of William Henry Harrison in 1840 and by 1842, Brownlow had turned outright hostile toward Harrison&#x27;s successor, John Tyler. After Clay&#x27;s defeat in the presidential election of 1844, Brownlow was grief-stricken. When the party snubbed Clay in favor of Zachary Taylor in 1848, Brownlow called on Whig electors to vote for Clay instead.

In the presidential election of 1852, Brownlow rejected Whig candidate Winfield Scott and supported Daniel Webster, although the Massachusetts senator died before the election. After the Whig Party disintegrated in 1854, Brownlow aligned with the Know Nothing movement, and intensified his attacks on non-Anglo American immigrants. In 1860, after the secession debate had come to dominate politics in the region, the &quot;Whig&quot; supported Constitutional Union presidential candidate John Bell, helping him capture the state&#x27;s electoral votes. After the war, the &quot;Whig&quot; became one of the few papers in the South to support the Radical Republicans.

===Religion===
While Clay was Brownlow&#x27;s political idol, Methodism founder John Wesley was his theological idol. Brownlow consistently refuted Wesley&#x27;s critics, and two of his favorite targets were Presbyterian minister F. A. Ross and Baptist preacher J. R. Graves. In 1847, the &quot;Whig&quot; ran a continuous column entitled &quot;Frederick Ross&#x27;s Corner,&quot; which bashed Ross&#x27;s character.

In the 1840s, as Northern and Southern Methodists argued over the slavery issue, Brownlow was offended by what he perceived as poor treatment of Southern Methodist leaders, especially Bishop Joshua Soule (who had ordained Brownlow as minister). When Northern Methodist leader Thomas Bond called for missionaries to be sent to the South, Brownlow warned that such missionaries would be lynched. &quot;The people of the South,&quot; he wrote, &quot;cannot regard such men, whatever may be their claims to the character, as true and faithful ministers of Christianity.&quot;

Brownlow&#x27;s anti-Catholic sentiment was present in the earliest editions of the &quot;Whig&quot;, and gradually intensified over the years. In 1846, Brownlow ran a multi-part series on &quot;Romanism&quot; in America, claiming that the Catholic Church had kept Europe in &quot;mental slavery&quot; for 1,200 years, and was inherently intolerant and opposed to democracy. Brownlow referred to Catholics as &quot;lousy, sinful, obedient subjects of a foreign Despot,&quot; and warned of their encroachment into American government.

===Secessionism===

In January 1860, Brownlow asked &quot;Whig&quot; readers to &quot;pray against the wicked leaders of Abolitionism and the equally ungodly advocates of Secessionism,&quot; a statement which sums up his pre-Civil War stance on both issues. Brownlow believed an independent South would continue to be run by the elite - Southern Democratic plantation owners, who would exploit small farmers. &quot;The honest yeomanry of these border States,&quot; he wrote, &quot;whose families live by their hard licks, four-fifths of whom own no negroes and never expect to own any, are to be drafted&quot; to fight for the &quot;purse-proud aristocrats of the Cotton States.&quot;

While Brownlow had supported Bell in 1860, he praised Lincoln as an &quot;Old Clay Whig,&quot; and argued that opposition to him had more to do with sectionalism than with slavery. He blasted the state of South Carolina (the first state to secede) as the &quot;home of traitors,&quot; and claimed that most South Carolinians were descended from Revolutionary War Loyalists, and thus had a love of aristocracy that &quot;will never suit Tennesseeans.&quot;

===Slavery===
Brownlow&#x27;s views on slavery were complex, and changed over time. In the 1830s, he was opposed to slavery, but for obscure reasons, had changed his mind by the following decade. Historian Robert McKenzie suggests that the hostility of Northern Methodists (who were abolitionists) toward Southern Methodists (who tended to be pro-slavery) in the 1840s may have driven Brownlow into the pro-slavery camp. In any case, by the 1850s, Brownlow was staunchly pro-slavery, arguing that the institution had been &quot;ordained by God.&quot;

Brownlow&#x27;s support for slavery remained unchanged throughout 1860 and 1861, and he and rival editors accused one another of secretly supporting abolitionism. In &quot;Parson Brownlow&#x27;s Book&quot;, published in 1862, Brownlow maintains his support of slavery, but clarified that he would do away with it if it meant preserving the Union. By April 1864, however, he had adopted an abolitionist viewpoint, and led a faction calling for emancipation at a gathering of East Tennessee Unionists. After the meeting, he gave a speech in support of a series of resolutions that deemed slavery &quot;incompatible with the perpetuity of free and republican institutions.&quot;

==History==

===Early publication===
As a Methodist circuit rider in the 1820s, Brownlow gained a reputation for vicious personal attacks against rival missionaries as they competed for converts across Southern Appalachia, and as early as 1828 Brownlow had been in court facing a slander charge. In the mid-1830s, Brownlow anonymously wrote several articles attacking nullification for the &quot;Washington Republican and Farmer&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a Jonesborough-based paper published by retired state supreme court justice Thomas Emmerson (1773–1837). Impressed, Emmerson suggested Brownlow leave the ministry to pursue a career in journalism.

After his marriage in 1839, Brownlow settled in Elizabethton, and began looking for steady income to support his family. T. A. R. Nelson, then a local attorney, suggested Brownlow publish a newspaper to support the Whigs in the upcoming elections. Brownlow formed a partnership with Mason R. Lyon, who had assumed publication of the &quot;Republican&quot; after Emmerson&#x27;s death. The first edition of the &quot;Tennessee Whig&quot; was published on May 16, 1839, with Brownlow as editor and Lyon as publisher. Within a few months, Brownlow&#x27;s vitriolic editorial style had left Elizabethton bitterly divided.

One Elizabethtonian who developed an immediate dislike of Brownlow was Landon Carter Haynes, a fellow Whig who had switched his support to the Democratic Party in 1839. In May 1840, following the &quot;Whig&quot;&#x27;s relocation to Jonesborough, Haynes wrote an article insulting Brownlow&#x27;s lineage. Enraged, Brownlow accosted Haynes in the streets of Jonesborough, and began beating him with a cane, prompting Haynes to draw a pistol and shoot Brownlow in the thigh. In 1841, Haynes was hired as editor of the &quot;Tennessee Sentinel&quot;, a Democratic paper published by former Emmerson associate Lawson Gifford, and an intense editorial rivalry developed between Brownlow and Haynes.

===Jonesborough===

The feud between Brownlow and Haynes continued through the early 1840s. Brownlow wrote that Haynes abounded in &quot;hopeless rottenness,&quot; and accused him of cheating tenants out of corn and selling infected hogs to a North Carolina merchant, while Haynes dubbed Brownlow a &quot;wretched abortion of sin&quot; and a &quot;tarnisher of female innocence.&quot; In 1842, Haynes attempted to join the Methodist ministry, but was denied due in part to a series of charges levied against him in the &quot;Whig&quot;. Haynes finally quit the newspaper business in 1845 to focus on his political career.

In 1843, Brownlow ran for Congress against Andrew Johnson, and used the &quot;Whig&quot; to promote his own campaign. Brownlow launched a barrage of attacks against Johnson, claiming (correctly) that Johnson&#x27;s cousin had been hanged for murder, accusing (incorrectly) Johnson&#x27;s father of being a chicken thief, and suggesting (incorrectly) that Johnson was illegitimate. Even after Johnson won the election, Brownlow continued his attacks. Johnson vowed to ignore him, arguing that Brownlow&#x27;s &quot;trade is to slander,&quot; and that Brownlow was &quot;wholly irresponsible for what he says or does.&quot; Brownlow refuted Johnson&#x27;s dismissal, calling him a &quot;base coward and low-bred scullion&quot; who was simply hiding from the facts.

Brownlow&#x27;s views and vindictive style provoked numerous assaults and assassination attempts. In March 1840, a gunman fired two shots into Brownlow&#x27;s house, although both shots missed. In August 1842, a mob attacked Brownlow at a camp meeting, but Brownlow fended them off with a pistol. In April 1849, an unknown assailant clubbed Brownlow in the back of the head, leaving him bedridden for two weeks.

===Knoxville===
By the time he relocated the &quot;Whig&quot; to Knoxville in May 1849, Brownlow was already well known in the city. Brownlow had previously clashed with the Democratic &quot;Knoxville Standard&quot;, which he called a &quot;filthy lying sheet,&quot; and blasted its editor, A. R. Crozier, as a &quot;miserable mockery of a man.&quot; Before he had settled into his new printing office on Gay Street, Brownlow had become embroiled in a war of words with &quot;Knoxville Register&quot; editor John Miller McKee that lasted until McKee&#x27;s departure in 1855.

Andrew Johnson&#x27;s political ascent in the mid-1850s was a constant source of frustration for Brownlow. The &quot;Whig&quot; rehashed claims that Johnson&#x27;s relatives were criminals, and accused Johnson of being an atheist (Johnson never joined a church, but always insisted he was a Christian). After Johnson was reelected governor in 1855, Brownlow published a prayer in the &quot;Whig&quot; that begged God to forgive Tennessee for electing an &quot;ungodly Governor.&quot;

In 1857, the &quot;Whig&quot; quarrelled with the radical &quot;Southern Citizen&quot;, published by Knoxville businessman William G. Swan and Irish Patriot John Mitchel, and Brownlow spent at least one night parading in front of Swan&#x27;s home while brandishing a revolver. During the same period, Brownlow blasted the officers of the failed Bank of East Tennessee, namely William Churchwell, J. G. M. Ramsey, and John H. Crozier, and accused them of swindling money from low-level depositors to pay the bank&#x27;s wealthy creditors.

===Secession crisis===

After the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860, the secession debate dominated the pages of the &quot;Whig&quot;, with Brownlow relentlessly attacking the idea of secession and its supporters. Knoxville&#x27;s secessionists cited Brownlow as the source of East Tennessee&#x27;s pro-Union support, complaining that the &quot;Whig&quot; was &quot;deluding and poisoning the public mind.&quot; In hopes of countering this sentiment, the &quot;Knoxville Register&quot; installed as its editor J. Austin Sperry, a radical secessionist whom Brownlow described as a &quot;scoundrel, debauchee, and coward.&quot;

In May 1861, the &quot;Whig&quot; announced it had exposed a forgery conspiracy involving several secessionists attempting to smear Andrew Johnson (with whom Brownlow had formed an uneasy alliance, since they were both pro-Union). Brownlow pushed this issue for several months, and accused the &quot;corrupt liar, low-down drunkard, irresponsible vagabond, and infamous coward of the &quot;Register&quot;&quot; of complicity in the matter. In August 1861, Sperry complained about visiting dignitaries spurning him in favor of Brownlow. This provoked taunts from Brownlow, who claimed that a paper with such &quot;limited circulation&quot; as the &quot;Register&quot; could not be called a &quot;competitor&quot; of the &quot;Whig&quot;, and cited Sperry&#x27;s &quot;bad morals&quot; as the reason for dignitaries avoiding him. &quot;The Whig&quot; reportedly had 10,700 subscribers throughout East Tennessee in 1861.

===The Civil War===
After Tennessee withdrew from the Union in June 1861, the Confederate Army occupied East Tennessee and arrested several noted Union supporters. Throughout the summer of that year, Brownlow dedicated much of the &quot;Whig&quot; to defending these Unionists. By October, the &quot;Whig&quot; was the last pro-Union newspaper in the Confederacy. Finally, on October 24, Brownlow announced he had become aware of an indictment issued against him and was suspending publication. The Confederate Army confiscated the &quot;Whig&quot; offices and used the printing machinery to convert muskets into rifles.

Brownlow was eventually arrested but released. He went into exile in the North, where he published a book and played an important role in rallying support for the liberation of East Tennessee. He returned to Knoxville on the heels of the Union general Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s invading army in September 1863, and revived the &quot;Whig&quot; under the title, &quot;Knoxville Whig, and Rebel Ventilator&quot;. Brownlow used the &quot;Whig&quot; to harass Knoxville&#x27;s Confederates, and had a number of them expelled. These included the Confederate diarist Ellen Renshaw House, who wrote that Brownlow was &quot;the vilest thing that ever lived.&quot;

===Later years===

After Brownlow was elected Governor of Tennessee in 1865, publication of the &quot;Whig&quot; was turned over to his son, John Bell Brownlow, although the elder Brownlow continued to write for the paper. As governor, Brownlow used the &quot;Whig&quot; to issue state proclamations, ignoring a Tennessee law requiring the Secretary of State&#x27;s signature. In 1868, Brownlow revived his old rivalry with Andrew Johnson by supporting Johnson&#x27;s impeachment.

In 1869, Brownlow sold the &quot;Whig&quot; to T. Hawes and Company, which in turn sold it to Knoxville businessman Joseph A. Mabry. Mabry had supported secession during the Civil War, but had since become friends with Brownlow. Mabry tried to transform the &quot;Whig&quot; into a Democratic newspaper, but was unsuccessful, and the paper failed shortly afterward.

In 1870, William Rule, a former &quot;Whig&quot; editor, launched the &quot;Knoxville Chronicle&quot;, which continued the &quot;Whig&quot;&#x27;s Republican leanings. Upon his return from the U.S. Senate in 1875, Brownlow purchased half ownership of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and it was renamed the &quot;Whig and Chronicle&quot;, which he edited until his death in 1877. Rule continued editing the paper, later renamed the &quot;Knoxville Journal&quot;, until his own death in 1928. The paper&#x27;s publication continued in Knoxville until 1991.

As of 2013, the &quot;Journal&quot; is a weekly paper with both print and online editions.

<text>Content-addressable memory (CAM) is a special type of computer memory used in certain very-high-speed searching applications. It is also known as associative memory or associative storage and compares input search data against a table of stored data, and returns the address of matching data. 

CAM is frequently used in networking devices where it speeds up forwarding information base and routing table operations. This kind of associative memory is also used in cache memory. In associative cache memory, both address and content is stored side by side. When the address matches, the corresponding content is fetched from cache memory.

==History==
Dudley Allen Buck invented the concept of content-addressable memory in 1955. Buck is credited with the idea of &quot;recognition unit&quot;.

==Hardware associative array==
Unlike standard computer memory, random-access memory (RAM), in which the user supplies a memory address and the RAM returns the data word stored at that address, a CAM is designed such that the user supplies a data word and the CAM searches its entire memory to see if that data word is stored anywhere in it. If the data word is found, the CAM returns a list of one or more storage addresses where the word was found. Thus, a CAM is the hardware embodiment of what in software terms would be called an associative array.

A similar concept can be found in the &quot;data word recognition unit&quot;, as proposed by Dudley Allen Buck in 1955.

==Standards==
A major interface definition for CAMs and other network search engines was specified in an interoperability agreement called the Look-Aside Interface (LA-1 and LA-1B) developed by the Network Processing Forum. Numerous devices conforming to the interoperability agreement have been produced by Integrated Device Technology, Cypress Semiconductor, IBM, Broadcom and others. On December 11, 2007, the OIF published the serial look-aside (SLA) interface agreement.

==Semiconductor implementations==

CAM is much faster than RAM in data search applications. There are cost disadvantages to CAM, however. Unlike a RAM chip, which has simple storage cells, each individual memory bit in a fully parallel CAM must have its own associated comparison circuit to detect a match between the stored bit and the input bit. Additionally, match outputs from each cell in the data word must be combined to yield a complete data word match signal. The additional circuitry increases the physical size and manufacturing cost of the CAM chip. The extra circuitry also increases power dissipation since every comparison circuit is active on every clock cycle. Consequently, CAM is used only in specialized applications where searching speed cannot be accomplished using a less costly method. One successful early implementation was a General Purpose Associative Processor IC and System.

In the early 2000s several semiconductor companies including Cypress, IDT, Netlogic, Sibercore, and MOSAID introduced CAM products targeting networking applications. These products were labelled Network Search Engines (NSE), Network Search Accelerators (NSA), and Knowledge-based Processors (KBP) but were essentially CAM with specialized interfaces and features optimized for networking. Currently Broadcom offers several families of KBPs.

==Alternative implementations==
To achieve a different balance between speed, memory size and cost, some implementations emulate the function of CAM by using standard tree search or hashing designs in hardware, using hardware tricks like replication or pipelining to speed up effective performance. These designs are often used in routers. The Luleå algorithm is an efficient implementation for longest prefix match searches as required in internet routing tables.

==Ternary CAMs==

Binary CAM is the simplest type of CAM and uses data search words consisting entirely of 1s and 0s. Ternary CAM (TCAM) allows a third matching state of &quot;X&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; for one or more bits in the stored word, thus adding flexibility to the search. For example, a stored word of &quot;10XX0&quot; in a ternary CAM will match any of the four search words &quot;10000&quot;, &quot;10010&quot;, &quot;10100&quot;, or &quot;10110&quot;. The added search flexibility comes at an additional cost over binary CAM as the internal memory cell must now encode three possible states instead of the two for the binary CAM. This additional state is typically implemented by adding a mask bit (&quot;care&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; bit) to every memory cell.
In 2013, IBM fabricated a nonvolatile TCAM using 2-transistor/2-resistive-storage (2T-2R) cells. A design of TCAM using hybrid Ferroelectric FeFET was recently published by a group of International scientists.

==Example applications==
Content-addressable memory is often used in computer networking devices. For example, when a network switch receives a data frame from one of its ports, it updates an internal table with the frame&#x27;s source MAC address and the port it was received on. It then looks up the destination MAC address in the table to determine what port the frame needs to be forwarded to, and sends it out on that port. The MAC address table is usually implemented with a binary CAM so the destination port can be found very quickly, reducing the switch&#x27;s latency.

Ternary CAMs are often used in network routers, where each address has two parts: the network prefix, which can vary in size depending on the subnet configuration, and the host address, which occupies the remaining bits. Each subnet has a network mask that specifies which bits of the address are the network prefix and which bits are the host address. Routing is done by consulting a routing table maintained by the router which contains each known destination network prefix, the associated network mask, and the information needed to route packets to that destination. In a simple software implementation, the router compares the destination address of the packet to be routed with each entry in the routing table, performing a bitwise AND with the network mask and comparing it with the network prefix. If they are equal, the corresponding routing information is used to forward the packet. Using a ternary CAM for the routing table makes the lookup process very efficient. The addresses are stored using &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; for the host part of the address, so looking up the destination address in the CAM immediately retrieves the correct routing entry; both the masking and comparison are done by the CAM hardware. This works if (a) the entries are stored in order of decreasing network mask length, and (b) the hardware returns only the first matching entry; thus, the match with the longest network mask (longest prefix match) is used.

Other CAM applications include:
*Fully associative cache controllers and translation lookaside buffers
*Database engines
*Data compression hardware
*Artificial neural networks
*Intrusion prevention systems
*Network processors
*Several custom computers, like the Goodyear STARAN, were built to implement CAM.

<doc id="327800" wikidata="Q899836" url="?curid=327800" title="Lipstick lesbian">
<text>&quot;Lipstick lesbian&quot; is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a great amount of feminine gender attributes, such as wearing make-up, dresses or skirts, and having other characteristics associated with feminine women. In popular usage, the term is also used to characterize the feminine gender expression of bisexual women, or the broader topic of female–female sexual activity among feminine women.

An alternate term for &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; is &quot;doily dyke&quot;.

==Definitions and society==
The term &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; was used in San Francisco at least as early as the 1980s. In 1982, Priscilla Rhoades, a journalist with the gay newspaper &quot;Sentinel&quot;, wrote the feature story &quot;Lesbians for Lipstick&quot;.

In 1990, the gay newspaper &quot;OutWeek&quot; covered the Lesbian Ladies Society, a Washington, D.C.–based social group of &quot;feminine lesbians&quot; that required women to wear a dress or skirt to its functions.

The term &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; became popular when used by writer Deborah Bergman, a reporter for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Some authors have commented that &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; is commonly used broadly to refer to feminine bisexual women or to heterosexual women who temporarily show romantic or sexual interest in other women to impress men. For example, Jodie Brian, in &quot;Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1&quot; (2009), states, &quot;A common depiction of lipstick lesbianism includes conventionally attractive and sexually insatiable women who desire one another but only insofar as their desire is a performance for male onlookers or a precursor to sex with men.&quot; In &quot;Intersectionality, Sexuality and Psychological Therapies&quot; (2012), &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; is defined as &quot;a lesbian/bisexual woman who exhibits &#x27;feminine&#x27; attributes such as wearing makeup, dresses and high heeled shoes&quot;; the book adds that &quot;more recent iterations of feminine forms of lesbianism such as &#x27;femme&#x27; (e.g. wears dresses/skirts or form-fitting jeans, low cut tops, makeup, jewelry), or &#x27;lipstick lesbian&#x27; [...], are an attempt to define as both lesbian and feminine.&quot;

Some lipstick lesbians say that they choose to perform femininity rather than be subjected to it, adding that they have made an active decision to be feminine, which subverts society&#x27;s demand of forced femininity. They commonly modify a typical feminine style to make it less heteronormative; Inge Blackman and Kathryn Perry gave the example of &quot;twinning short skirts with Doctor Martens (DMs) or lacy underwear with men&#x27;s trousers&quot;.

Author M. Paz Galupo stated, &quot;Young women exposed to mainstream media outlets are seeing expressions of the same-sex desire between women much more frequently than ever before. However, mainstream images of same-sex desire between women are very specific, meaning they are often of hyper-feminine women (&#x27;lipstick lesbians&#x27;).&quot; The prominence of lipstick lesbians in the media is echoed by Rosalind Gill, who stated, &quot;The figure of the &#x27;luscious lesbian&#x27; [lipstick lesbian] within advertising is notable for her extraordinarily attractive, conventionally feminine appearance.&quot; Although some authors have said that the existence of lipstick lesbians is a destabilization of heterosexual ideals, by breaking the assumption that a feminine person will always desire a masculine person, and vice versa, others have said that the lipstick lesbian emergence simply fails in this regard, as lipstick lesbians are still subject to the male gaze, and still found acceptable due to their femininity. 

==In media==
The term is thought to have reached wide usage in the 1990s. A 1997 episode of the television show &quot;Ellen&quot; widely publicized the phrase. In the show, Ellen DeGeneres&#x27;s character, asked by her parents whether a certain woman is a &quot;dipstick lesbian&quot;, explains that the term is &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot;, and comments, &quot;I would be a ChapStick lesbian.&quot; In the 1999 film &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;, the character played by Julie Delpy is identified as &quot;Lipstick Lesbian&quot; in the film credits.

==Flag controversy==
The lipstick lesbian flag was introduced by Natalie McCray in 2010 in the weblog &quot;This Lesbian Life&quot;. The design contains a red kiss in the left corner, superimposed on seven stripes consisting of six shades of red and pink colors and a white bar in the center. The flag has not been widely adopted due to some lesbians asserting that it is not inclusive of butch lesbians, while others have argued that McCray wrote biphobic, racist, and transphobic comments on her now-defunct blog.

The colors of the &quot;pink&quot; lesbian flag were copied from the lipstick lesbian flag (with the kiss mark excluded). The maker of the &quot;pink&quot; flag remains unknown. The pink flag attracted more use as a general lesbian pride flag.

<doc id="327801" wikidata="Q7257425" url="?curid=327801" title="Public Interest Research Group">
<text>Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) are a federation of U.S. and Canadian non-profit organizations that employ grassroots organizing and direct advocacy on issues such as consumer protection, public health and transportation. The PIRGs are closely affiliated with the Fund for the Public Interest, which conducts fundraising and canvassing on their behalf.

==History==
The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. college campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book &quot;Action for a Change&quot; by Ralph Nader and Donald Ross, in which they encourage students on campuses across a state to pool their resources to hire full-time professional lobbyists and researchers to lobby for the passage of legislation which addresses social topics of interest to students. Ross helped students across the country set up the first PIRG chapters, then became the director of the New York Public Interest Research Group in 1973.

The Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, founded in 1971, was the first state PIRG to incorporate. It was followed by Oregon (OSPIRG) and Massachusetts (MASSPIRG). By the late 1990s, there were PIRGs in 22 states with chapters on more than 100 college campuses. U.S. PIRG reported 1 million members by 2000. The state PIRGs created U.S. PIRG in 1984 to have a national lobbying presence in Washington, D.C.

In their first two decades, PIRGs worked on a variety of issues:
* Bottle bills: Beginning in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, the PIRGs were supportive of container deposit legislation in the United States, popularly called &quot;bottle bills&quot;. MASSPIRG lobbied for six years for enactment of a state bottle return law, eventually winning container deposit legislation in 1982.
* Toy safety: U.S. PIRG has released toy safety reports every year since 1986, which has led to recalls of more than 35 toys.
* Lemon law: ConnPIRG and CALPIRG were involved in passing the first new-car lemon laws in 1982 that require manufacturers to repair or repurchase severely defective relatively new vehicles.
*Safer art supplies: CALPIRG led the effort to enact the nation&#x27;s first laws protecting children and artists from toxins in art supplies in 1985. USPIRG followed with a federal law in 1988.

==Funding model==
PIRGs on college campuses have historically been funded through the use of automatic billing with a portion of student activity fees in the form of a labor checkoff or in the form of automatically enrolled dues to the association. Students may elect at some institutions to have the fees refunded to them or opt-out, although many students are unaware that this is the case. At some institutions, opting out of the fee only lasts one academic term, requiring students who do not wish to be members and pay dues to have to opt-out. In 1982, the PIRGs established the Fund for the Public Interest (commonly referred to as &quot;the Fund&quot;) as its fundraising and canvassing arm.

==Controversies==
The student fee system of PIRG funding has been met with controversy and with a number of legal challenges. In 2014, students at Macalester College in Minnesota voted to end their relationship with MPIRG due to the group&#x27;s revenue structure, which relied on MPIRG automatically receiving a cut of student activity fees.

The Fund For the Public Interest has been subject to lawsuits and accusations of unfair and exploitative labor practices, and it has resisted unionization efforts by its canvassers.

In 2016, U.S. PIRG joined conservative groups in opposing the Obama Administration&#x27;s rules that expanded worker overtime pay, which resulted in criticism against the organization in the popular press.

In 2022, the PIRG campus affiliate was shut down at the University of Connecticut after an effort by the local chapter to separate itself from the state and national organization failed to meet legal requirements.

In 2023, Student PIRGs successfully used a ballot initiative at the University of Oregon to double their student automatic billing of dues at the expense of other student activities.

==Transparency==

As of 2024, the U.S PIRG Education Fund is rated a four-star charity by Charity Navigator, with an overall score of 92%. Charity Navigator defines a four-star review, as &quot;Exceeds or meets best practices and industry standards across almost all areas. Likely to be a highly effective charity.&quot;

==Programs and campaigns==

===Consumer protection===
U.S. PIRG&#x27;s consumer protection work includes financial and product safety reforms.

U.S. PIRG lobbied for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent U.S. government agency which was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act after the Great Recession and the financial crisis of 2007–2008. U.S. PIRG helped win passage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009, protecting consumers from certain predatory practices by credit card companies.

Product safety work includes warning consumers about potentially unsafe products in the marketplace, such as recalled baby products and food.

===Public health===
U.S. PIRG has called on major restaurant chains including McDonald&#x27;s and KFC
to end the use of meat raised with antibiotics, a practice that contributes to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in people. During the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. PIRG organized medical experts to speak about the U.S.&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of 150 sent a letter to political leaders urging them to shut down the country and start over with strategies to contain the surging coronavirus pandemic.

===Transportation===
U.S. PIRG and individual state PIRGs have taken positions against highway expansion or new construction projects as wastefully expensive and unneeded, helping to stop projects such as the Illiana Expressway in Illinois.

===Higher education===
U.S. PIRG actively lobbied for passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in 2007, which reduced interest rates on student loans and increased funding for Pell Grants. It supported the expansion of open educational resources on campus and of campus food banks.

==Affiliated non-profits==
Some PIRGs are members of a larger network of non-profit organizations called the Public Interest Network. While part of the same organization and often staffed by the same individuals, these affiliates are often presented in publications to imply they are different. In the past, they have also helped to launch a number of other independent public interest non-profits, including:
# Citizen utility boards
# The National Environmental Law Center
# Frontier Group

==Local affiliates==
Twenty-five U.S. states have a statewide PIRG that is directly affiliated with the Public Interest Network/U.S. PIRG. Other state PIRGs that are not part of the network include the New York, Vermont, Alaska, and Minnesota PIRGs. The state PIRGs are:

* AKPIRG (Alaska)*
* Arizona PIRG
* CALPIRG (California)
* CoPIRG (Colorado)
* ConnPIRG (Connecticut)
* Florida PIRG
* Georgia PIRG
* Illinois PIRG
* Iowa PIRG
*MaryPIRG (Maryland)
*MassPIRG (Massachusetts)
*PIRGIM (Michigan)
*MPIRG (Minnesota)*
*MoPIRG (Missouri)
* MontPIRG (Montana)
* NHPIRG (New Hampshire)
* NJPIRG (New Jersey)
* NMPIRG (New Mexico)

* RIPIRG (Rhode Island)
* Penn PIRG (Pennsylvania)
* TexPIRG (Texas)
* VPIRG (Vermont)*

<doc id="327803" wikidata="Q5188912" url="?curid=327803" title="Crossword abbreviations">
<text>Cryptic crosswords often use abbreviations to clue individual letters or short fragments of the overall solution. These include:
* Any conventional abbreviations found in a standard dictionary, such as:
** &quot;current&quot;: (for &quot;alternating current&quot;); less commonly, (for &quot;direct current&quot;); or even (the symbol used in physics and electronics)
* Roman numerals: for example the word &quot;six&quot; in the clue might be used to indicate the letters 
* The name of a chemical element may be used to signify its symbol; e.g., for tungsten
* The days of the week; e.g., for Thursday 
* Country codes; e.g., &quot;Switzerland&quot; can indicate the letters 
* ICAO spelling alphabet: where Mike signifies and Romeo 
* Conventional abbreviations for US cities and states: for example, &quot;New York&quot; can indicate and &quot;California&quot; or .

The abbreviation is not always a short form of the word used in the clue. For example:
* &quot;Knight&quot; for (the symbol used in chess notation)

Taking this one stage further, the clue word can hint at the word or words to be abbreviated rather than giving the word itself. For example:
* &quot;About&quot; for or (for &quot;&quot;), or .
* &quot;Say&quot; for , used to mean &quot;for example&quot;.

More obscure clue words of this variety include:
* &quot;Model&quot; for , referring to the Model T.
* &quot;Beginner&quot; or synonyms such as &quot;novice&quot; or &quot;student&quot; for , as in L-plate.
* &quot;Bend&quot; for or (as in &quot;S-bend&quot; and &quot;U-bend&quot;)
* &quot;Books&quot; for or , as in Old Testament or New Testament.
* &quot;Sailor&quot; for , abbreviation of able seaman.
* &quot;Take&quot; for , abbreviation of the Latin word &quot;recipe&quot;, meaning &quot;take&quot;.

Most abbreviations can be found in the Chambers Dictionary as this is the dictionary primarily used by crossword setters. However, some abbreviations may be found in other dictionaries, such as the Collins English Dictionary and Oxford English Dictionary.

<text>Margaret Clap (died ), better known as Mother Clap, ran a coffee house from 1724 to 1726 in Field Lane, Holborn, Middlesex, a short distance from the City of London. As well as running a molly house (an inn or tavern primarily frequented by homosexual men), she was heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premises were raided and shut down. While not much is known about her life, she was an important part of the gay subculture of early 18th-century England. At the time sodomy in England was a crime under the Buggery Act 1533, punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or the death penalty. Despite this, particularly in larger cities, private homosexual activity took place. To service these actions there existed locations where men from all classes could find partners or just socialize, called molly houses, &quot;molly&quot; being slang for a gay man at the time. One of the most famous of these was Clap&#x27;s molly house.

==Clap&#x27;s molly house==

Margaret Clap ran a coffee house that served as a molly house for the underground homosexual community. Her house was popular during the two years of its existence (1724–1726), being well known within the homosexual community. She cared for her customers, and catered especially to the homosexual men who frequented it. She was known to have provided &quot;beds in every room of the house&quot; and commonly had &quot;thirty or forty of such Kind of Chaps every Night, but more especially on Sunday Nights.&quot; Clap was present during the vast majority of the molly house&#x27;s operational hours, apparently only leaving to run across the street to a local tavern, to buy drinks for her customers. Because Clap had to leave the premises to retrieve alcohol to serve to her customers, it is likely that the molly house was hosted in her own private residence. Unlike other molly houses, it was not a brothel. Clap&#x27;s intentions may have been based more upon pleasure than profit, judging by her goodwill towards her customers. For example, one man lodged at her house for two years and she later provided false testimony to get a man acquitted of sodomy charges. Her actions during the charges later laid against her and many of the homosexual community showed her loyalty to her customers.

===Raid of 1726===
In February 1726, Margaret Clap&#x27;s molly house was raided by the police; around 40 of its occupants were arrested. Primarily targeted by the Society for the Reformation of Manners, the house had been under surveillance for two years. The surveillance seems to have been instigated by a collection of vengeful mollies-turned-informants. A man named Mark Patridge was outed by his lover and was then turned as an informant for the police. He led policemen into molly houses, introducing each of them as his &quot;husband&quot; so that they could investigate more thoroughly. Patridge was not tried in court for sodomy. Another notable informant was Thomas Newton, who frequently used entrapment to allow constables to arrest men in the act of instigating sodomy.

<text>A veteran () is a person who has significant experience (and is usually adept and esteemed) and expertise in an occupation or field.

A military veteran is a person who is no longer serving in the armed forces.

A topic of interest for researchers has been the health of military personnel after leaving the military, particularly those who served in combat areas. This concern stems from veterans in countries like the US and Australia, being disproportionately over-represented in psychological and substance abuse disorders relative to the general population. In Australia, the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs provides a proactive service to address &#x27;real life&#x27; health care problems in the veteran community.

==Public attitude towards veterans==

Military veterans often receive special treatment in their respective countries. War veterans are generally treated with great respect and honour, although negative feelings towards veterans may be held in certain situations: veterans of unpopular or lost conflicts may be discriminated against. In some countries (e.g., Germany after 1945), veterans are neither honoured in any special way by the general public, nor have their dedicated Veterans Day, although events are sometimes orchestrated by minority groups.

The way veterans are portrayed in the media is likely to contribute to public attitudes. A small scale survey in 2020 indicated several ways in which veterans themselves feel that their representation in the media could be improved, by avoiding certain stereotypes.

Many countries have longstanding traditions, ceremonies, and holidays to honour their veterans. In Commonwealth member states, Remembrance Day is held on November the 11th and is focused mostly on the veterans who died in service. A red or white Poppy is worn on the lapel (for remembrance or for peace, respectively) in the weeks up to the date, and wreaths and flowers laid at memorials to the dead.

In Russia, a tradition was established after World War II where newly married couples would on their wedding day visit a military cemetery. In France, for instance, those wounded in war are given the first claim on any seat on public transit. Most countries have a holiday such as Veterans Day to honour their veterans, along with the war dead.

In Zimbabwe, the term &quot;veteran&quot; is used for political purpose and may not actually refer to someone that participated in a war, but rather to someone who feels entitled to some benefit because of association with a cause for which there had been an actual war.

==Veterans&#x27; experiences around the world==
===Congo-Kinshasa===

Some veterans from the Belgian commitment of the Congolese to World War II live in communities throughout the Congo. Though they received compensation from the government during the rule of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, after his overthrow they no longer receive pensions.

===United Kingdom===

Ex-service is British terminology for veterans, which refers to those who have served in the British Empire or Commonwealth Armed Forces.

Britain, with its historic distrust of standing armies, did little for its veterans before the 19th century. It did set up two small hospitals for them in the 1680s. In London and other cities the streets teemed with disabled or disfigured veterans begging for alms.

The First World War focused national attention on veterans, especially those who had been partly or wholly disabled. The King&#x27;s National Roll Scheme (KNRS) was an employment program for disabled veterans of the First World War. Kowalsky says it was practical, innovative, and ahead of its time and was the most important piece of legislation enacted for disabled veterans in interwar Britain. In addition to direct aid, it stimulated a national discussion regarding the need for employment programs for disabled veterans and the responsibility of the state, setting up a future demand for more benefits.

In the 21st century, Britain has one of the highest densities of veterans in a major country, with 13 million in 2000, or 219 per 1,000 population.

===United States===

In the United States, a &quot;veteran&quot; is a person who has served in the armed forces (including the Reserve and certain members of the United States National Guard) and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. A common misconception is that only those who have served in combat or those who have retired from active duty can be called military veterans.

In 1990, 40% of young Americans had a veteran for a parent; this decreased to 16% in 2014. In 2016, of the veterans who were born outside of the United States, Mexican and Filipino Americans made up the two largest populations, with 3% of all veterans having been born outside of the United States. As of 2017 there are some 21 million American veterans.

According to the Pew Research Center, &quot;Among men, only 4% of millennials [born 1981-96] are veterans, compared with 47%&quot; of men in their 70s and 80s, &quot;many of whom came of age during the Korean War and its aftermath.&quot;

====Veterans&#x27; benefits in the United States====
President Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address in 1865 towards the end of the American Civil War, famously called for good treatment of veterans: &quot;[T]o care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan&quot;. The American Civil War produced veterans&#x27; organizations, such as the Grand Army of the Republic and United Confederate Veterans. The treatment of veterans changed after the First World War. In the years following, discontented veterans became a source of instability. They could quickly organize, had links to the army and often had arms themselves. The Bonus Army of unemployed veterans was one of the most important protest movements of the Great Depression, marching on Washington, D.C. to get a claimed bonus now that Congress had promised them decades in the future.

Each state of the United States sets specific criteria for state-specific veterans&#x27; benefits. For federal medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, prior to 7 September 1980 the veteran must have served at least 180 days of active duty, after the above-mentioned date the veteran must have served at least 24 months. However, if the veteran was medically discharged and receives a VA service-connected disability stipend, the time limits are not applicable.

====American veteran experience after World War II====
After the Second World War, in part due to the experience of the First World War, most of the participating states set up elaborate veterans&#x27; administrations. Within the United States, it was veterans groups, like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, that pushed for and got the G.I. Bill enacted. These gave veterans access to free or subsidized education and health care. The newly educated GIs created a significant economic impact, and with the aid of VA loans were able to buy housing and establish themselves as part of a growing American middle class. The explosion of the suburbs created sufficient housing for veterans and their families.

====American veteran experience after OEF and OIF====
Many veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have had to face challenges unique to warfare in the 21st century. One significant difference between OEF and OIF and previous wars is a greater dependence on reservists and repeat deployments. Up to 80% of troops deployed at the beginning of OEF were part of the National Guard and Reserve and about 40% of currently serving military members have been deployed more than once. This has meant that many deployed troops, not being as &quot;steeped in military culture&quot; have had more difficult transitions into military life, and for many the increased redeployment rate has meant more transitions, more uncertainty, longer terms, and shorter dwell times, all of which contribute to greater stress.

Due to medical advances, warfare in the 21st century tends to yield more survivors with severe injuries which soldiers in previous wars would have died from. This means that, though fewer service members die, more return from war with injuries more serious, and in turn more emotionally devastating, than ever before. Among these injuries is the increasingly common traumatic brain injury, or TBI, the effects of which can range from a mild concussion to amnesia and serious neurological damage.

====Female veterans in the U.S.====

Women have served in the United States military for over two hundred years. Some female veterans perceive themselves as discriminated against by their male counterparts and, as such, women who have served in the armed forces have sometimes been known as &quot;the invisible veterans&quot;. Women were not fully recognized as veterans until after WWII, and prior to this they were not eligible for VA benefits. The current percentage of U.S. Veterans who are women is more than 8 percent. Women make up nearly 11.6 percent of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. A tri-state (Washington, Idaho, Oregon) women veterans conference in Pendleton, Oregon, in April 2008, attracted 362 women veterans, according to the &quot;East Oregonian&quot; newspaper. A growing number of states are recognizing June 12 as Women Veterans Day, either through proclamation or legislative action.

On August 5, 2011, Erica Borggren was appointed Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and has been &quot;creating a new Women Veterans Program to help address the issue that women veterans often do not self-identify as veterans and do not take advantage of veterans’ benefits to the same extent as their male peers.&quot; She gathered in a webcast panel moderated by Stacey Baca with Dr. Rebecca J. Hannagan and Kimberly Mitchell at the Pritzker Military Library on January 24, 2013, to discuss important issues facing female veterans in today&#x27;s military.

====African American veterans in the U.S.====

African Americans have participated in every war fought by or within the United States. Black veterans from World War I experienced racial persecution on returning to the U.S. from overseas, particularly in Southern cities. 
Black veterans from World War II continued to be denied equality at home despite President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s desegregation of the military after World War II. Black veterans went on to play a central role in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The National Association for Black Veterans is an organization that provides advocacy and support for African American and other minority veterans.

==Health effects of military service and treatment for veterans==
The effect of active military service can be profound and lasting, and some veterans have found it difficult to adjust to normal life again. Figures from 2009 showed that twice as many veterans were in prison than there were British troops currently in Afghanistan. Homelessness, street-sleeping and relationship breakdown are also commonly reported. Research done by the UK homelessness charity CRISIS (1994) and the Ex-Services Action Group (1997) both found that a quarter of homeless people had previously served in the armed forces. The &quot;Times&quot; newspaper reported on 25 September 2009 that in England and Wales the number of &quot;military veterans in jail has more than doubled in six years&quot;. Another &quot;Times&quot; article of the same date quoted the veterans mental health charity Combat Stress as reporting a 53% increase in referrals from doctors.

===Suicide===
==== Risks ====
In Australia, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S., military veterans of all ages carry a substantially elevated suicide risk relative to the general population, particularly younger veterans.

In Canada, Denmark, the U.K., and the U.S., deployment to a war zone (unless in a combat role) has not been associated with an increased risk of suicide. A study of the U.S. army found that the career stage carrying the greatest risk was initial military training.

Research in several countries has found that the personnel most at risk include those who: had a troubled childhood; are of low rank; have close-combat roles in war; and/or leave service soon after joining. Other risk factors common to military life include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol misuse, bullying and sexual harassment.

==== Examples ====
An article in the London &quot;Metro&quot; on 28 January 2010, &#x27;Veterans prone to suicide&quot;&#x27;,&quot; cited a report by the Mental Health Foundation saying that more needed to be done to care for UK veterans of the Afghanistan War. Many had &quot;plunged into alcohol problems, crime and suicide&quot; upon their return.

In the U.S., the suicide rate among veterans is 300% the national average. They account for 30% of the suicides in the US annually.

According to a 2015 report by the Japanese Ministry of Defense, 56 Japan Self Defense Force members had committed suicide after serving in overseas missions to Iraq and the Indian Ocean. Defense officials stated that 14 deaths were due to mental illness, 13 to family or financial problems and three to official duties.
===Posttraumatic stress disorder===

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a condition that affects a significant number of veterans. Studies involving veterans with combat-related PTSD indicate that between 4-17% of United States veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. Their United Kingdom counterparts, however, have significantly lower numbers of just 3-6%.

New treatment programs are emerging to assist veterans suffering from post-combat mental health problems such as depression and PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is becoming an important method for the treatment of mental health issues among veterans, and is currently considered the standard of care for depression and PTSD by the United States Department of Defense. CBT is a psychotherapeutic approach that aims to change the patterns of thinking or behavior that responsible for patient&#x27;s negative emotions and in doing so change the way they feel. It has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD among war veterans. Recently, online programs that pair CBT with therapist interaction have also proven effective in treating mental health problems among veterans. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is also an effective and noninvasive, drug-free treatment for PTSD, although it has not been tested against specific military traumatic exposure for efficacy.

Veterans under the age of 25 are at higher risk for PTSD than veterans older than 25. Younger veterans with severe PTSD are at higher risk for metabolic syndrome and suicide.

Music therapy provides veterans with a way to express themselves, escape from anxiety, and helps them cope with their PTSD. In Mike Lawson “Music and Science Meet…Music Therapy”, Lawson explains “Modern music therapy became a norm in the Veteran&#x27;s Administration hospitals during and after both World Wars. In its most basic form the playing of recordings on the Victrola in WW I, hospitals had measurable positive effects on the wounded and shell-shocked patients. This began the use of a somewhat primitive music therapy in all American military hospitals.”

===Other disorders===
Veterans are at higher risk than the general population for several disorders, especially younger veterans (those younger than 25). Younger veterans are at increased risk for substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, and mental illnesses in general.

===Help for veterans===

Necessity has resulted in a number of sources of help being made available for veterans. Many of these are independent, charitable organisations, and in some countries the aftercare and rehabilitation services provided by Governments have been inadequate. This may be because they do not wish to give attention to the negative effects of military service and the difficulties of readjustment to civilian life for it may have an adverse impact upon recruitment for their armed forces. Nevertheless, help is available and veterans should feel able to make contact and ask for assistance or advice to the broad network of organizations, and to appropriate legislators, without feeling that this is a weakness. Military service can be a profoundly unnatural experience and it is likely that some help may be needed in debriefing and rehabilitation into the community, whether it be medical, psychological, practical or financial. There were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans in the United States during January 2013, accounting for 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans are female.

<text>National Music Lovers Records was a United States based record label of the 1920s.

The label was put out by National Music Lovers Incorporated of New York City. The records, issued from 1920 through 1928, was sold via mail order, eight records for three dollars. All the recordings were apparently done by other record companies, with masters leased and discs pressed by National Music Lovers. Issues include recordings originally made by Pathé, Emerson, Banner, and other labels. On most if not all National Music Lovers discs the original artists are listed under pseudonyms.

The bulk of sides were popular dance tunes of the era. The label also issued recordings of Irish music, opera, and &quot;old time songs&quot;.

<text>The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) is the portion of the Intracoastal Waterway located along the Gulf Coast of the United States. It is a navigable inland waterway running approximately from Saint Marks, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas.

The waterway provides a channel with a controlling depth of , designed primarily for barge transportation. Although the U.S. government proposals for such a waterway were made in the early 19th century, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was not completed until 1949.

==EHL &amp; WHL mileages==

Locations along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway are defined in terms of statute miles (as opposed to nautical miles, in which most marine routes are measured) east and west of Harvey Lock, a navigation lock in the New Orleans area located at . The Hathaway Bridge in Panama City, Florida, for example, is at mile 284.6 EHL (East of Harvey Lock). The Queen Isabella Causeway Bridge at South Padre Island is at mile 665.1 WHL (West of Harvey Lock).

==Connecting waterways==

The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway crosses or meets, and in some cases is confluent with, numerous other navigable rivers and waterways. They include:

*Apalachicola River
*Arroyo Colorado
*Atchafalaya River
*Bayou Lafourche
*Bayou Terrebonne
*Calcasieu River
*Calcasieu Ship Channel
*Delcambre Canal
*Houston Ship Channel
*Industrial Canal
*Lower Mississippi River

*Mobile Bay (connecting to the Tenn-Tom Waterway)
*Pearl River
*Sabine-Neches Waterway (Includes portions of)
**Neches River
**Sabine Lake
**Sabine River
*Santa Rosa Sound
*The Rigolets
*Vermilion River

==Ports and harbors==

Many of the busiest ports in the United States in terms of tons of cargo are located on or near the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Notable ports on or near the waterway include:
&lt;br&gt;
Florida

<doc id="327813" wikidata="Q2023863" url="?curid=327813" title="There are no atheists in foxholes">
<text>&quot;There are no atheists in foxholes&quot; is an aphorism used to suggest that times of extreme stress or fear can prompt belief in a higher power. In the context of actual warfare, such a sudden change in belief has been called a foxhole conversion. The logic of the argument is also used to argue for the opposite.

==Origin==
The statement is an aphorism used to argue that people will believe in, or hope for, a higher power in times of fear or stress, such as during war (&quot;in foxholes&quot;). The origin of the quotation is uncertain. The U.S. military chaplain William Thomas Cummings may have said it in a field sermon during the Battle of Bataan in 1942, though scholars have been unable to find a firsthand witness to the sermon. Other sources credit Lieutenant Colonel Warren J. Clear (or the anonymous sergeant he spoke with there), who was also at Bataan and published the usage in 1942; or Lieutenant Colonel William Casey. The phrase is often attributed to war correspondent Ernie Pyle; however, no such source published prior to Pyle&#x27;s death is known. It was also quoted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in remarks broadcast from the White House as part of a February 7, 1954, American Legion Program. With slightly different wording, the statement appears much earlier in press reports dating from the end of the First World War, while a similar concept has been sought in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot;, and in Karl Marx&#x27;s often-misrepresented partial quote that &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people&quot;.

==Usage==
While primarily used to comment on the experiences of combat soldiers, the aphorism has been adapted to other perilous situations, as in &quot;There are no atheists in probate court&quot;. Although the adage occasionally means that all soldiers in combat are &quot;converted&quot; under fire, it is most often used to express the belief of the speaker that all people seek a divine power when they are facing an extreme threat. The quote is also referenced when discussing the opposite effect — that warfare causes some soldiers to question their existing belief in God due to the death and violence around them.

The quote has also been used in non-military contexts. In September 2008, in the depths of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, both Ben Bernanke and Paul Krugman popularized a version of the quote in reference to financial crises. They paraphrased Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel, who originally wrote in the &quot;Cato Journal&quot; a year earlier, &quot;They say &#x27;there are no atheists in foxholes.&#x27; Perhaps, then, there are also no libertarians in crises.&quot; The sentence is also quoted in the Gustav Hasford&#x27;s novel &quot;The Short-Timers&quot;. The quote has been used by but commonly misattributed to economist Paul Krugman.

==Criticism==
Several atheist organizations object to the phrase. The Military Association of Atheists &amp; Freethinkers has adopted the catch-phrase &quot;Atheists in Foxholes&quot; to criticise the aphorism. Author James K. Morrow said: &quot;That maxim, &#x27;There are no atheists in foxholes,&#x27; it&#x27;s not an argument against atheism — it&#x27;s an argument against foxholes.&quot; In 2015, describing the phrase as a &quot;tired, old, untrue cliché&quot;, the Freedom From Religion Foundation erected a monument to &quot;Atheists in Foxholes&quot;, commemorating American atheist, agnostic, freethinking and skeptical US armed services veterans.

<text>Kaseya Center (Pat Riley Court at Kaseya Center) is a multi-purpose arena on Biscayne Bay in Miami, Florida. The arena is home to the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. The arena was previously named American Airlines Arena from opening in 1999 until 2021, FTX Arena from 2021 until 2023 following the bankruptcy of FTX, and Miami-Dade Arena during an interim period in 2023. Since April 2023, the naming rights to the arena are owned by Kaseya under a 17-year, $117.4 million agreement.

The arena has capacity for 19,500 people, including 2,105 club seats, 80 luxury suites, and 76 private boxes. Additionally, for more intimate performances, The Waterfront Theater, the largest indoor theater in Florida, is within the arena complex, seating between 3,000 and 5,800 patrons. The theater can be configured for concerts, worship events, family events, musical theatre shows and other stage productions. American Airlines, which has a hub at Miami International Airport, maintains a travel center at the venue.

The arena is directly served by the Miami Metrorail at Government Center station via free transfers to Metromover Omni Loop, providing direct service to Freedom Tower station and Park West station stations, within walking distance. It is also within walking distance from the Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre station.

The arena has 939 parking spaces, with those spaces reserved for premium seat and Dewar&#x27;s 12 Clubhouse ticket holders during Heat games. ParkJockey manages the arena&#x27;s on-site parking.

==History==
In 1997, the owners of the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association, which then played in the eight-year-old, publicly financed Miami Arena, threatened to move to Broward County unless they were given the $38 million parcel of land for the new arena by Alex Penelas, then-mayor of Miami-Dade County. The agreement provided that the county receive 40% of annual profits of the arena, which was above $14 million.

Construction began on February 6, 1998. The arena was designed by Arquitectonica and 360 Architecture.

Kaseya Center opened as the American Airlines Arena on December 31, 1999, and its construction cost was $213 million. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The arena&#x27;s opening was inaugurated with a concert by Gloria Estefan. Two days later, on January 2, 2000, the Miami Heat played its first game in the new arena by defeating the Orlando Magic 111–103.
As part of its sponsorship arrangement, American Airlines had a giant aircraft painted atop the arena&#x27;s roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design was visible from airplanes taking off and landing at Miami International Airport, where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called &quot;Flagship Lounges&quot;, a trademark originally used for American&#x27;s premium-class lounges at certain airports. Until the date that the arena was renamed in 2020–2021, the arena used the 1967-2013 logo of American Airlines.

The arena was sometimes referred to as &quot;Triple-A&quot; or &quot;A3&quot; (A cubed).

The arena is known for its unusual scoreboard, designed by artist Christopher Janney and installed in 1998 as part of the original construction. Drawing on the underwater anemone forms, the scoreboard also changes colors depending on the atmosphere.

For concerts in an arena configuration, end stage capacity is 12,202 for 180° shows, 15,402 for 270° shows, and 18,309 for 360° shows. For center stage concerts the arena can seat 19,146.

WTVJ, the city&#x27;s NBC-owned and operated station in Miami, had their Downtown Miami Studios in the back of the arena from 2001 until 2011.

In 2013, the Miami Heat paid rent on the arena for the first time pursuant to the percentage rent agreement with the county; the payment was $3.32 million.

On September 10, 2019, American Airlines said that it would not renew its naming rights upon expiration at the end of 2019. The American Airlines Arena court decals were removed from the Heat&#x27;s floor before the 2020–21 season and replaced temporarily with the logo of team/league vehicle sponsor Kia Motors.

In March 2021, FTX acquired the naming rights to the arena in a $135 million, 19-year agreement. The NBA approved the deal in early April, and the arena was renamed FTX Arena in June 2021, just after the Miami Heat were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs.

As part of the bankruptcy of FTX, the naming rights agreement was terminated effective January 2023. After three months under the temporary name of Miami-Dade Arena, a 17-year naming rights agreement was reached with Miami-based software company Kaseya to name the arena Kaseya Center beginning April 2023. Under the terms of the contract, the county receives the majority of the naming rights revenue while the Heat receives $2 million annually.

In October 2024, it was announced that the court would be dedicated to longtime coach and executive Pat Riley, who led the Heat to three championships and helped the team acquire LeBron James and Chris Bosh in 2010.

<text>Starr Records was a record label founded by the Starr Piano Company of Richmond, Indiana. Gennett Records was also owned by Starr Piano.

Starr&#x27;s first discs were vertical cut records in the mid 1910s based on Edison Records standard found in the Edison Disc Record. They were discontinued in 1917. The Starr label was continued through much of the 1920s in Canada, pressed and distributed by Compo Company Ltd., mostly issuing sides that were released in the U.S. on Gennett.

An unrelated Starr Records made records in Australia which were sold in the Coles chain.

<doc id="327826" wikidata="Q1757759" url="?curid=327826" title="Jamaican tangelo">
<text>The Jamaican tangelo, also known by proprietary names ugli fruit (pronounced &quot;ugly&quot;), and uniq fruit (pronounced &quot;unique&quot;), is a citrus fruit that arose on the island of Jamaica through the natural hybridization of a tangerine or orange with a grapefruit (or pomelo), and is thus a tangelo. The original tree is believed to have been a hybrid formed from varieties of Seville orange, grapefruit and tangerine.

As a hybrid species, it is usually represented as &quot;Citrus reticulata&quot; × &quot;paradisi&quot;.

== Discovery ==
This tangelo was a natural hybrid, having arisen spontaneously like the grapefruit, near Brown&#x27;s Town, Jamaica. It was discovered growing wild in or about 1917, then passed through several generations of budwood grafting, selecting for fewer seeds. Since the 1930s the main producer has been the Sharp family of Trout Hall plantation in Trout Hall village Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. It was exported to Canada and England by 1934, and to the United States in 1942. &#x27;UGLI&#x27; is a registered trademark of Cabel Hall Citrus Limited, under which it markets the fruit, the name being a variation of the word &quot;ugly&quot;, which refers to the fruit&#x27;s unsightly appearance, with rough, wrinkled, greenish-yellow rind, wrapped loosely around the orange pulpy citrus inside.

== Description ==
The light-green surface blemishes turn orange when the fruit is at its peak ripeness. The Jamaican tangelo is usually slightly larger than a grapefruit (but this varies) and has fewer seeds. The flesh is very juicy and tends toward the sweet side of the tangerine rather than the bitter side of its grapefruit lineage, with a fragrant rind.

The taste is often described as sourer than an orange and less bitter than a grapefruit, however, and is more commonly guessed to be a lemontangerine hybrid. The fruit is seasonal, from December to April. It is distributed in Europe and the United States between November and April, and is on occasion available from July to September.

<doc id="327827" wikidata="Q1159583" url="?curid=327827" title="Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)">
<text>Danger Mouse is a British animated television series produced by Cosgrove Hall Productions for Thames Television. It features the eponymous Danger Mouse who worked as a secret agent and is a parody of British spy fiction, particularly the &quot;Danger Man&quot; series and James Bond. It originally ran from 28 September 1981 to 19 March 1992 on the ITV network.

The series spawned a spin-off show, &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, which aired between 1988 and 1993. A revival under the same name, aired on CBBC from 2015–2019.

== Plot ==
Danger Mouse is a secret agent with the British Secret Service, and together with his sidekick Penfold is repeatedly ordered by Colonel K, the head of the Secret Service, to save the world.

They work underneath Scotland Yard on Baker Street in London, hidden inside a red pillar box. Their arch-enemies are Baron Silas Greenback and his criminal organization, who try to achieve world domination by unconventional means such as stealing all famous buildings, or creating giant robots, etc.

A special role is played by the off-screen narrator, Isambard Sinclair, who accompanies the action by commenting on it sarcastically, talking to the characters or musing about his private life.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Danger Mouse (voiced by David Jason) – Often called the world&#x27;s greatest secret agent—so secret, in fact, that his codename has a codename. His catchphrases include &quot;Good grief&quot; when he becomes upset or shocked, &quot;Penfold, shush&quot; when his assistant makes a foolish remark. He was originally going to be brown; however, the creators thought that he and Penfold needed to be different colours.
: Brian Cosgrove described Jason&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;His voice had the perfect mix of forcefulness, humour and gentleness. He was totally committed to doing voiceovers for silly cartoons, which warmed my heart, and we became great friends.&quot; Jason said &quot;I wanted to make him sound believable. We decided he would be softly spoken, very British, very heroic, but also a bit of a coward. He&#x27;d save the world, but he&#x27;d also run for it!&quot;
* Ernest Penfold (voiced by Terry Scott) – A timid, bespectacled hamster, and Danger Mouse&#x27;s reluctant assistant and sidekick. He is often mistaken for a mole; however, Brian Cosgrove has stated Penfold is supposed to be a hamster. Penfold stands just over half the height of Danger Mouse, and always wears thick round glasses and a crumpled blue suit with a white shirt and a yellow and black striped tie. In the first episode, he is codenamed the Jigsaw &quot;because when he is faced with a problem, he goes to pieces.&quot;
: Brian Cosgrove came up with Penfold&#x27;s character design when he was waiting for a meeting with Thames Television, and had drawn up &quot;this little fellow with heavy glasses and a baggy suit&quot; and then realized he had drawn his brother Denis, who worked for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; and &quot;who was bald with heavy black glasses&quot;.
* Colonel K (voiced by Edward Kelsey) – Danger Mouse&#x27;s boss; often mistaken for a walrus, it was revealed in an issue of &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine that he is, in fact, a chinchilla. During the last two seasons, he became more absent-minded, tending to frustrate both Danger Mouse and Penfold with his tendency to ramble nonsense. A running gag in the later seasons is that he botches the usage of the phrase &quot;over and out&quot; multiple times.
* Baron Silas Greenback (voiced by Edward Kelsey) – The recurring villain and Danger Mouse&#x27;s archenemy; a toad with a wheezy voice, although, sometimes, he was referred to as a frog. Known as Baron Greenteeth in the unbroadcast pilot episode. Commonly known as the &quot;Terrible Toad&quot;. In the US, &quot;greenback&quot; is slang for dollar bill in many regions; this adds to the sense of his commercial greed. Allegedly, he turned to a life of crime as a schoolboy when other children stole his bicycle and let all the air out of its tyres.
* Stiletto (voiced by Brian Trueman) – Greenback&#x27;s henchman; a crow. He always called Greenback &quot;Barone&quot;, Italian for &quot;Baron&quot;. In the original British version, he speaks with an Italian accent; this was changed to a Cockney accent for the U.S. distribution to avoid offending Italian-Americans. His last name is Mafiosa. In series 5, he is more incompetent and klutzy that Greenback usually has to whack him with his walking stick, and in series 9, Greenback uses a &quot;hit box&quot; that whacks Stiletto on the head with a mallet. 
* Nero (sounds provided by David Jason) – Greenback&#x27;s pet. A fluffy white caterpillar (equivalent to the stereotypical white cat frequently associated with arch villains, particularly Ernst Stavro Blofeld). He is a non-speaking character, although his noises and laugh are supplied by David Jason&#x27;s voice sped up. Readily understood by Greenback and, less frequently, by Stiletto. He does not have any superpowers, except In the season 5 episode &quot;Nero Power&quot;, where he temporarily exhibits the ability of telekinesis. In the special features of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; cartoons, audiences were informed that Nero is actually the mastermind of Greenback&#x27;s schemes.
* The Narrator (voiced by David Jason) – The unseen narrator, who occasionally interacts with the characters, sometimes to the point of halting the plot for one reason or another. In a series 6 episode, he accidentally sends Danger Mouse and Penfold back in time with his broken mike. He often voices his disdain for the show and his job towards the end of the episode and through part of the closing credits. His name is Isambard Sinclair.

===Supporting===
* Professor Heinrich Von Squawkencluck – An inventor mole, first appearing in the series where he was engaged in hormone experiments to grow chickens to enormous sizes. He invented the Mark III, Danger Mouse&#x27;s flying car, and the Space Hopper, his personal spacecraft. He speaks in a broken German accent. Penfold is naturally leery of the professor, as he often winds up on the wrong side of his experiments.
* Flying Officer Buggles Pigeon – Another of Colonel K&#x27;s agents, who comes to the aid of Danger Mouse and Penfold in the episode &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, and appeared in several episodes afterward. 
* Agent 57 – A master of disguise, appearing initially as an earthworm. Agent 57 has disguised himself so often that he forgot his original appearance. In the series 6 episode &quot;The Spy Who Stayed In with a Cold&quot;, he gained the ability to change shape to resemble any character or animal whenever he sneezed, but when he shows Danger Mouse his original form, Danger Mouse is horrified.
* Leatherhead – Greenback&#x27;s other crow henchman. Even less intelligent than Stiletto, he appeared in several of the early episodes, where he spent most of his time reading comic books.
* Count Duckula (voiced by David Jason) – A fame-obsessed vampire duck who wants to appear in television. However, his utter lack of anything approaching talent makes his attempts to &quot;entertain&quot; rather terrifying (he has been known to use his &quot;act&quot; as a torture device). This resulted in a spin-off series, titled &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, starring the Count himself. The two versions of the character differ, however; the character featured in &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; is not a vegetarian, makes far greater use of his vampiric magic, and has an accent consisting of a lisp and a stutter, as well as occasional stuttering and duck-like squawks and quacks.
* J. J. Quark – A space alien who recurs in series 6. He speaks with a Scottish accent and claims possession of Earth based on a cosmic charter granted to his great-great-great-great-grandfather. He has a robot assistant named Grovell, who always grovels whenever his name is mentioned, much to Quark&#x27;s frustration.
* Doctor Augustus P. Crumhorn III (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert): – A mad scientist wolf, he recurred as Danger Mouse&#x27;s adversary starting in series 9. In the episode, &quot;Penfold Transformed&quot;, he lists his full name as &quot;Aloisius Julian Philibert Elphinstone Eugene Dionysis Barry Manilow Crumhorn&quot;, omitting both Augustus and the III. He and Greenback were at odds; once Crumhorn kidnapped Penfold and Penfold managed to escape simply because the two villains were too busy quarreling to notice his absence.

==Production==
===Development===
The show was created by Mark Hall and Brian Cosgrove for their production company, Cosgrove Hall Films. Danger Mouse was based on Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s lead role in &quot;Danger Man&quot;. The show was intended to have a more serious tone as seen in the pilot episode but Mike Harding (who wrote the music for the show) gave Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall the idea to make the series silly. &quot;The characters had got stuck in reality and were doing James Bond type things rooted in the solid real world,&quot; said Harding, &quot;I argued that once you invented a Mouse Secret Agent then all of creation and a good chunk of not creation was his oyster. In other words we could be as barmy (crazy) as we wanted.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Cosgrove said &quot;We reckoned a secret service mouse foiling the plans of an evil toad – Baron Silas Greenback – was suitably ridiculous.&quot;

Cosgrove and Hall brought in Brian Trueman, who was working as an announcer on &quot;Granada TV&quot;, as the main writer for the series. For the voice of Danger Mouse, they picked David Jason after they saw him in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. For the voice of Penfold, they picked Terry Scott, who was known for the show &quot;Terry and June&quot;.

On 4 June 1984, the show was (along with &quot;Belle and Sebastian&quot;) the first animated show to appear on Nickelodeon in the United States, and quickly became the second-most popular show on the channel after &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;, as it appealed to both children and adults with its quick-witted English humour. It was often described by American audiences as a British equivalent of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, due to its gentle satire of politics and outrageous plots.

It returned to terrestrial television after the BBC purchased episodes of it to broadcast in its daytime schedules with its first broadcast on 12 February 2007 on BBC Two.

The show was expensive to make, sometimes needing 2,000 drawings thus footage was reused while certain scenes were set in the North Pole or &quot;in the dark&quot; (i.e. black with eyeballs visible only, or, in Danger Mouse&#x27;s case, simply one eyeball) as a cost-cutting measure. This time-and-money saving device was cheerfully admitted by both Brian Cosgrove, who conceived the character and the show, and Brian Trueman, who wrote almost all the scripts from the beginning.

==Reception and legacy==
During the cartoon&#x27;s run, it reached a peak viewing figure of 7.2 million viewers on 3 January 1983, with average figures being around 3–4 million per episode.

In 2001, the show was ranked third in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV Shows&quot;. In 2008 it was named the 62nd-best animated series by IGN, who considered it one of the first British cartoons to become popular with American audiences.

=== Other awards ===
In 2012, Brian Cosgrove received a Special Award from the British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards.

==In other media==
===Comics===
A long-running comic strip adaptation, written by Angus P. Allan and illustrated by Arthur Ranson, ran in &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine and was syndicated in various other magazines. Ranson also provided some backdrops for the show. Allan and Ranson&#x27;s work was highly appreciated by Cosgrove Hall, and the pair were awarded an &quot;Oh Goodness!, Oh Crikey!&quot; award in appreciation of their services. Some of Allan&#x27;s stories were adapted for the show, although Allan&#x27;s name was misspelled &quot;Angus Allen&quot;. Artist Ranson later went on to illustrate Judge Anderson in the UK comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

===Video games===
A series of video games based on the character also appeared. The first were &quot;Danger Mouse in Double Trouble&quot; and &quot;Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau&quot; (both in 1984) followed by &quot;Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee!&quot; in 1985.

Two mobile games were published by ZED Worldwide; &quot;Danger Mouse: Quiz&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; in 2011.

===Audiobooks===
Some stories were also available as read-along cassettes with accompanying books. They were re-read by the cast for audio.

===Merchandise===
During its run, the show spawned a wide range of merchandise, including storybooks, hardback annuals, jigsaw puzzles, a Panini sticker album, View-Master reels, and of course, VHS releases. In the years since, products have continued to sell, often aimed at the now-adult audience who grew up with it, such as T-shirts, mugs, key rings, fridge magnets and posters. In 2006, to coincide with the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Cosgrove Hall licensed rights to a number of companies to produce a range of new anniversary merchandise including Blues Clothing (women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; underwear and sleepwear) and Concept 2 Creation (collectible figurines).

FremantleMedia launched a webshop run by Metrostar e-commerce where a wide variety of goods were for sale, including the CD Audio adaptation of two of the show&#x27;s episodes using the original artists&#x27; voices, released by Steve Deakin-Davies: The Ambition Company.

=== Other appearances ===
* American musician &amp; producer Danger Mouse chose his stage name as a reference the show, initially performing in a mouse costume.
* In the 1989 film &quot;The BFG&quot;, which was also produced by Cosgrove-Hall, a &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; poster is shown above a boy&#x27;s bed.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
==Broadcast history==

The series was transmitted on ITV via the CITV brand from 1981 to 1992. The show has the initials &#x27;DM&#x27; prominently emblazoned on his chest. This causes problems for those translating it into other languages, where a literal translation of the words &#x27;Danger&#x27; and &#x27;Mouse&#x27; do not have those initials; the Scots Gaelic version, for example, calls the show (and the lead) &quot;Donnie Murdo&quot; (two given names unconnected either with mice or danger). which was broadcast on STV – from 1990 to 1994 and again on BBC Alba in 2015. The series has also been broadcast on numerous channels on Boomerang (2000–06) and BBC Two (2007–09).

He was Dzielna Mysz (brave mouse) in Polish, Dundermusen (Thundermouse) in Swedish, and &quot;Dare Dare Motus&quot; in French, &quot;Dare Dare&quot; being French slang for &quot;as fast as possible&quot;. The Slovene translation omitted the DM initials entirely, however, dubbing Danger Mouse &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Brave Mouse&#x27;).

In Australia, the show was first broadcast on ABC TV in 1982 it then moved to Network Ten in 1996. It was also the first British cartoon to break into Cheez TV, being shown on weekdays.

In the United States the show was broadcast on Nickelodeon from 1984 to 1987, and 1991 to 1994. It was the first fully-fledged animated show to air on the network.

== Revival ==

It was reported in 2013 that the series was under consideration for a revival, and in June 2014 it was announced that a new series was being made for broadcast on CBBC in 2015. The new series is produced by Boulder Media for FremantleMedia Kids. It is directed by Robert Cullen with Brian Cosgrove, one of the original creators, acting as creative consultant. Alexander Armstrong and actor Kevin Eldon voice Danger Mouse and Penfold, respectively; Dave Lamb takes the role of the narrator, whilst Stephen Fry plays Colonel K and Ed Gaughan takes over as Baron Greenback. Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Pointless&quot; co-host Richard Osman appears in the series as Professor Strontium Jellyfishowitz. John Oliver voices the character Dr Augustus P Crumhorn III and Lena Headey voices the character Jeopardy Mouse, a character newly introduced into this series. This series aired on Netflix in the US. Kevin Eldon describes the animation style as &#x27;much the same as the original&#x27;. The first episode aired on 28 September 2015.

Jazwares is the master toy partner, Penguin Books published a range of printed books, including story books, official guides, sticker books, novelty books, annuals and electronic titles and D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. published a monthly magazine with comic strips, puzzles, fact files, poster and competitions.

<text>Peter Bondra (; born 7 February 1968) is a Ukrainian-born Slovak former professional ice hockey player. He was the general manager of the Slovakia national team from 2007 to 2011. A two-time 50-goal scorer, Bondra became the 37th player in National Hockey League (NHL) history to score 500 NHL goals; he is one of four eligible 500-goal players not currently in the Hockey Hall of Fame. He has the fewest points among all players who reached that milestone, with 892, making him one of only two (with Maurice Richard) 500-goal scorers not on the list of NHL players with 1,000 points. Bondra scored the most goals in the NHL in two seasons, and . He is one of the few players who scored five or more goals in one NHL game. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Life and family==
Bondra was born in 1968 in , Lutsk Raion, Ukraine, which was then a part of the Soviet Union. Bondra&#x27;s father (a Slovak) had moved to Lutsk from Jakubany, Czechoslovakia, when he was 16, and where he met his wife (a Pole). The parents moved with Peter and his two older brothers, Juraj and Vladimír, to Poprad, Czechoslovakia when Peter was three years old. His father died in 1982.

Bondra was a Soviet citizen when he arrived in the United States, later obtaining a Slovak passport and citizenship in 1993 before the start of the 1994 Winter Olympics qualifying tournament. After living in Crofton, Maryland, Bondra resides in Riva with his wife Luba, their daughter Petra, and their sons David and Nick. He has participated in multiple alumni games and appearances with the current Capitals organization. His son David is a forward of Bratislava Capitals and also plays for Slovak national team, similarly to his father. His other son, Nick, began his collegiate career at Amherst College in 2017.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Bondra played one season for HK Poprad in the lower ranks of Czechoslovak league competition, and transferred to VSŽ Košice in the First Division at the age of 18. His older brother Juraj also played there on defense, having already won one championship title with the team the year before. As early as his second season with Košice, Peter was considered one of the top shooters in the Czechoslovak league, and won the league championship together with his brother in 1988.

====National Hockey League====
Bondra was drafted by the Washington Capitals in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, 156th overall. Before joining the Capitals, he played for TJ VSŽ Košice (now called HC Košice) for four seasons from 1986 to 1990 in Czechoslovakia. In Washington, Bondra became one of the more prolific goal-scorers of the 1990s. Due to the language barrier, he became good friends with Ukrainian-born Capitals player Dmitri Khristich, with whom he conversed in both Russian and Ukrainian. His deepest playoff run came in 1997–98, when the Capitals advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals before being swept by the Detroit Red Wings. In the 2003–04 season, Bondra&#x27;s 14th with Washington, the Capitals endured a disappointing year and in a salary purge move traded veteran members of the team to contenders. As a result, Bondra was traded to the Ottawa Senators for Brooks Laich and a second round draft pick. At the press conference announcing this trade, Bondra notably broke into tears.

In 14 years with the Capitals, Bondra scored 472 goals and racked up 353 assists in 961 games. He holds the Capitals team records in short-handed goals (32). With Washington, he appeared in five All-Star Games (1993, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999). In 1997 and 1999, Bondra won the Fastest Skater Competition on All-Star weekend. In 2004, the Capitals held a vote for fans to determine the top 30 players in franchise history to celebrate their 30th season in the league. Bondra finished second with 2,018 votes. The winner, Olaf Kölzig, beat him by only 20 votes.

During the 1994–95 (with 34 in a lockout-shortened season) and 1997–98 seasons (with 52), Bondra led the league in goals scored, although the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for most goals scored in a season did not exist until the 1998–99 season.

After the 2004–05 NHL season was canceled due to the NHL labor dispute, Bondra played a handful of games with HK Tatravagónka ŠKP Poprad of the Slovak Extraliga. Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bondra was in talks to rejoin the Capitals, though he ended up signing with the Atlanta Thrashers for one season.

On 10 December, Bondra signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. On 22 December 2006, he scored his 500th NHL career goal at the United Center, in Chicago&#x27;s 3–1 victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bondra drove to the net and netted the rebound of Jassen Cullimore&#x27;s shot from the left point past Toronto&#x27;s Jean-Sébastien Aubin, 6:37 into the third period on the power play. Bondra was the 37th player in league history to reach the 500-goal mark and the fourth player to record his 500th goal in a Blackhawks sweater, joining Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita and Michel Goulet.

On 29 October 2007, Bondra announced his retirement from professional hockey at the age of 39. Since retirement, Bondra has represented Colosseo USA, a Slovak company that makes custom video scoreboards.

==International play==



Bondra has represented Slovakia on seven occasions in international competition, including the 1994 Winter Olympics qualifying tournament, the 1998 Winter Olympics, the 2006 Winter Olympics, the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and the Ice Hockey World Championship in 2002 and 2003. He scored a tournament-leading seven goals (including the tournament-winning goal) and ranked third among all players with nine points to lead Slovakia 4–3 over Russia to the gold medal at the 2002 World Championship. He notched five points (three goals, two assists) in eight games to help Slovakia earn the bronze medal at the 2003 World Championship. Overall, he played 47 games and scored 35 goals for Slovakia.

<doc id="327835" wikidata="Q202645" url="?curid=327835" title="Adrian Mutu">
<text>Adrian Mutu (; born 8 January 1979) is a Romanian professional football manager and former player who is currently in charge of Liga I club Petrolul Ploiești. During his playing career, he was deployed as a forward or an attacking midfielder.

Mutu started his career playing two years for Argeș Pitești and half a season for Dinamo București, before joining Inter Milan in Italy midway through the 1999–2000 Serie A. After only ten games with the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;, he left for Hellas Verona and then Parma, for which he scored 39 goals in the next three years. His excellent form brought him a €22.5 million transfer to Chelsea and a nomination for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2003. Following a failed drug test, he was released and returned to Serie A to join Juventus. After the 2006 Italian football scandal and the relegation of Juventus to Serie B, Mutu decided to join Fiorentina, where he played consistently for the next five years. He then had a season at Cesena and French club Ajaccio, before returning to his native country with Petrolul Ploiești in 2014. After two more brief spells with Pune City and ASA Târgu Mureș, Mutu retired from professional football in 2016.

A controversial figure off the field, Mutu received widespread attention following a positive test for cocaine while playing for Chelsea in 2005, which resulted in his immediate release from the club, a subsequent seven-month ban from the Football Association, and Mutu later being ordered to pay £15.2 million in damages to his former employers, the largest financial penalty in FIFA history. He has unsuccessfully tried to appeal the fine numerous times, and was banned for a second time in 2010 following a positive test for sibutramine while at Fiorentina.

From his international debut in 2000, Mutu played 77 matches for the Romania national team and scored 35 goals, a joint record alongside Gheorghe Hagi. He was included in the country&#x27;s squads at the UEFA European Championship in 2000 and 2008. A four-time winner of the Romanian Footballer of the Year award, only Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorghe Hagi have received the award more times, with six and seven wins, respectively.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Mutu began his professional career with Argeș Pitești and Dinamo București. He joined the latter in 1998 for the equivalent of €700,000 and won the Cupa României. At the turn of the millennium, he signed for Inter. The selling club reported the fee as $2.1 million while the buyers said it was $7.15 million, leading to an investigation by Romanian tax authorities in 2006.

Mutu made his Inter debut in Serie A on 6 January 2000 in the final minutes of a 5–0 home win over Perugia. He totalled 14 appearances and two goals in his first spell at the San Siro, with both goals in the Coppa Italia.

===Verona===
In 2000, Mutu was sold by Inter to Verona in co-ownership deal, for 7,500 million lire (€3,873,427). The Veneto side also signed Massimo Oddo, Mauro Camoranesi (later a teammate at Juventus), and young rising star Alberto Gilardino (later a teammate at Fiorentina) that season. As Verona faced fellow strugglers Bari on matchday 18 in February 2001, Mutu came off the bench with Verona down a man and trailing 0–1 and scored two goals, inspiring Verona to a 3–2 victory. The club narrowly avoided relegation through winning the relegation tie-breaker playoffs. In June 2001, Verona bought Mutu outright, for 5,100 million lire. (€2,633,930)

===Chelsea===
On 12 August 2003, Chelsea paid Parma €22.5m (around £15.8m) for Mutu&#x27;s transfer as part of new owner Roman Abramovich&#x27;s spending spree, on a five-year contract. He made his debut 11 days later, and scored the winning goal from distance in a 2–1 home victory against Leicester City, and with two in a 4–2 win at Stamford Bridge against Tottenham Hotspur on 13 September, he totalled four goals in his opening three games.

In the 2004–05 season, Mutu had a difficult relationship with the club&#x27;s new manager José Mourinho, with each accusing the other of lying about whether the player was injured for a 2006 World Cup qualifying match against the Czech Republic. In September 2004, Mutu was banned from football for 7 months until May 2005 after testing positive for cocaine use.

====Breach of contract issue====
Chelsea started to seek compensation from Mutu in early 2005. The Football Association Premier League Appeals Committee decided that the player had committed a breach of his contract without just cause which made Chelsea eligible to claim the compensation. Mutu started his first appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in April 2005 but the case was dismissed in December 2005. On 11 May 2006, Chelsea applied to FIFA for an award of compensation against Mutu. In particular, the club requested that the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) award compensation to the club following Mutu&#x27;s breaching the employment contract without just cause. However, on 26 October, the DRC decided that it did not have jurisdiction to make a decision in the dispute and that the claim by the club was therefore not admissible. On 22 December, Chelsea lodged a new appeal before the CAS seeking the annulment of the DRC&#x27;s decision. On 21 May 2007, a CAS panel allowed the club&#x27;s appeal, set aside the DRC&#x27;s decision, and referred the matter back to the DRC, &quot;which does have jurisdiction to determine and impose the appropriate sporting sanction and/or order for compensation, if any, arising out of the dispute&quot; between the Club and the Player,&quot;

On 7 May 2008, the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber ordered Mutu to pay €17,173,990 in compensation to his former club, Chelsea FC, for breach of contract. This included €16,500,000 for the unamortised portion of the transfer fee paid to Parma, €307,340 for the unamortised portion of the sign-on fee (received by Mutu), and €366,650 for the unamortised portion of the fee to the Agent, but was not to take into account the determination of the damages for the amounts already paid by the club to the player (consideration for services rendered) or the remaining value of the employment contract (valued at €10,858,500). Mutu had to pay within 30 days after being informed of the decision in August 2008. Mutu lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport for the second time, but on 31 July 2009, that court dismissed his appeal, and Mutu was ordered to pay Chelsea the amount plus interest of 5% p.a. starting on 12 September 2008 until the effective date of payment; the matter was submitted to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for its determination. In addition, Mutu had to pay the costs of arbitration for both parties, including CHF 50,000 to Chelsea. The fine was the highest ever levied by FIFA.

Mutu could have been banned from football by FIFA if he did not pay the fine although some lawyers disputed this. Mutu started his third appeal, this time to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, in October 2009, but on 14 June 2010 this appeal was also dismissed with Mutu again being ordered to pay Chelsea €17m in damages. In 2013, FIFA DRC decided in a new ruling that Livorno and Juventus were also jointly liable to pay compensation; both clubs immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On 21 January 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport annulled the FIFA DRC ruling; Mutu remained the sole party to pay the compensation.

In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights rejected Mutu&#x27;s appeal against the CAS&#x27;s 2015 ruling.

===Juventus===
Mutu signed a five-year contract with the Italian club Juventus on 12 January 2005, despite still being banned from football until 18 May. As Juventus had no available room to buy another non-EU player from abroad, the move also involved fellow Serie A club Livorno, who signed the player and contemporaneously sold him to Juventus.

===Fiorentina===
On 8 July 2006, Fiorentina announced that they had signed Mutu for €8 million.

In July 2008, A.S. Roma made a reported €18 to 20 million offer to sign him outright, but Mutu hinted that he may remain in Florence and eventually signed a new contract reported last to 2012.

On 29 January 2010, it was reported that Mutu failed a doping test after a Coppa Italia match against Lazio match nine days earlier, in which he scored twice in to help Fiorentina win 3–2. The INOC was requested to hand Mutu a one-year ban by the Italian anti-doping prosecutor. He eventually received a nine-month ban on 19 April, which was later reduced to six months and ended on 29 October. After the ban finished, Mutu was suspended by the club due to breach of contract (AWOL) on 7 January 2011. After such events, Mutu publicly apologised to the club and parted company with his agent Victor Becali; on 3 February 2011 Fiorentina announced the player was reinstated into the first team with immediate effect.

===Later career===
On 23 June 2011, it was officially announced that Cesena had signed Mutu on a two-year contract. On 15 January, Mutu scored two goals versus Novara and took his tally to 101 goals in Serie A. After a couple of unconvincing games, on 11 April, Mutu scored a goal against Genoa, to eventually earn a draw for Cesena.

In the summer of 2012, after Cesena relegated from Serie A, the two parties ended the contract by mutual consent.

After his release from Cesena, Mutu signed a new contract with AC Ajaccio of the French Ligue 1 on 28 August 2012. He said that he favoured the Italian culture on Corsica, dismissed claims that he was preparing for retirement, and stated that he would score more goals than Zlatan Ibrahimović of Paris Saint-Germain. Club president Alain Orsoni said that Mutu was the highest-profile player to come to Corsica since Johnny Rep joined SC Bastia in 1978.

After his previous season&#x27;s goal haul was enough to keep Ajaccio in Ligue 1, Mutu&#x27;s second season saw him play just 9 games and not score, before terminating his contract on 14 January 2014 alongside compatriot Ștefan Popescu.

Later that day he was presented at Petrolul Ploiești in front of 10,000 fans. He was signed by his former international teammate, Cosmin Contra. In the summer of 2014, Mutu scored both home and away against Viktoria Plzeň in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round, a double which Petrolul impressively won 5–2 on aggregate.

On 26 September 2014, Petrolul announced that the club had ended the contract between the two parties.

On 30 July 2015, Mutu signed as the marquee player for Indian Super League club FC Pune City.

In January 2016, Mutu returned to Romania with ASA 2013 Târgu Mureș, having been assured by national manager Anghel Iordănescu that he could have a place in the UEFA Euro 2016 squad if he played in a better league than India&#x27;s.

==International career==

===Euro 2000===
He played in three of four matches at the UEFA Euro 2000, where Romania reached the quarterfinals for the first time. 

===Euro 2008===
Mutu scored Romania&#x27;s only goal of Euro 2008 in the 55th minute of their second match against Italy, however in the same match he had a second-half penalty saved by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, which could have sent Italy out of the competition and would have guaranteed Romania a spot in the quarter finals. The game finished 1–1.

Since 2009, Romania&#x27;s national team coach Răzvan Lucescu has had reservations about calling him up, because Mutu was revealed to be consuming alcohol after a match with Serbia in World Cup 2010 Qualifications. Because of poor results and fan pressure, Răzvan Lucescu was forced to call him up again. Mutu scored a brace in his first game back, a 3–1 win over Luxembourg on 29 March 2011, Romania&#x27;s first win of the qualifiers. He also scored once in the next game, a 3–0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on 3 June 2011.

===International ban===
On 11 August 2011, Mutu and his teammate Gabriel Tamaş were excluded from the Romania national team after they were found drinking at a bar on the night of 10 August, while their teammates were playing in a friendly match against San Marino. However, after only three games, their suspension was lifted. On 21 November 2013, Mutu was barred from playing on the national team after he posted an image of manager Victor Piţurcă as Mr. Bean on Facebook.

==Style of play==
A highly skilful and creative player, with an eye for goal, who was, however, troubled by off-field issues throughout his career, Mutu was capable of playing in several offensive positions, and was used as a supporting forward, as a main striker, as a winger, and also as an attacking midfielder, due to his ability to both score and assist goals. Often compared to compatriot Gheorghe Hagi, in his prime, Mutu was a quick and mobile player, with excellent technical skills and dribbling ability, and was also an accurate set-piece and penalty-kick taker. Despite his talent, he was often prone to injury and accused of inconsistency throughout his career, and was also notorious for his temperamental character and behaviour on the pitch; because of this, he was often regarded as not having lived up to his true potential.

==Managerial career==
Mutu began his managerial career in April 2018 when he was appointed as manager of Romanian Liga I club Voluntari, signing a two-year contract following the departure of former manager Claudiu Niculescu. However, his tenure lasted just two months. Although he managed to save the club from relegation, winning a play-off against Chindia Târgoviște, the club&#x27;s board of directors chose to fire Mutu on 14 June. Club president Dan Leasa disagreed with the board&#x27;s decision and also left the club.

In July 2018, Mutu was signed by United Arab Emirates club Al Wahda to be the manager of their reserve team.

On 11 July 2023, Neftçi announced the appointment of Mutu as their new Head Coach. On 24 December 2023, Mutu left his role as Head Coach of Neftçi after his contract was terminated by mutual agreement.

On 24 January 2024, Mutu was appointed as manager of Liga I club CFR Cluj. On 3 April 2024, Mutu resigned as a CFR Cluj coach.

==Personal life==
Mutu was in a relationship with Israeli model and actress Moran Atias during the early 2000s.

From 2001 to 2003, he was married to the Romanian actress and television presenter Alexandra Dinu with whom he has a son, Mario (2002).

In 2005, he married Consuelo Matos Gómez, a Dominican model, at the Romanian Orthodox Scala Celli church in Rome. They have two daughters, Adriana (2006) and Maya Vega (2008). They got divorced in 2015.

In 2016, he married Sandra Bachici, a former model. They have a son, Tiago Adrian Mutu (2017).

<doc id="327839" wikidata="Q7551344" url="?curid=327839" title="Social promotion">
<text>Social promotion is an educational practice in which a student is promoted to the next grade at the end of the school year, regardless of whether they have mastered the necessary material or attended school consistently. This practice typically applies to general education students, rather than those in special education. The main objective is to keep students with their peers by age, maintaining their intended social grouping. Social promotion is sometimes referred to as promotion based on &quot;seat time&quot;—the time the student spends in school. It is based on enrollment criteria for kindergarten, which often requires students to be 4 or 5 years old at the start of the school year (5 or 6 years old for first graders), with the goal of allowing them to graduate from high school before turning 19.

Advocates of social promotion argue that it is done to protect students&#x27; self-esteem, foster socialization with their age cohort, encourage participation in sports teams, or promote students who may be weaker in one subject but stronger in others.

In Canada and the United States, social promotion is generally limited to primary education. Secondary education is more flexible, as students can take different classes based on their academic level rather than strictly by grade. This flexibility reduces the significance of social promotion. For instance, a student might study social studies with their age group while taking math with younger students, depending on their assessed math level.

In some countries, grade retention is allowed for students who have not learned the required material or who have been frequently absent. The opposite of social promotion is merit-based promotion, where students advance only after demonstrating mastery of the necessary material. This could involve either moving to the next grade or advancing to a higher-level course in the same subject. In grade-based curricula, this is known as &quot;mid-term promotion.&quot; In course-based curricula, promotion is open-ended and depends on fulfilling prerequisites for the next course.

==Pros==
Supporters of social promotion policies do not so much defend social promotion as argue that retention is even worse. They contend that retention is not a cost-effective response to poor performance when compared to other interventions, such as additional tutoring or summer school, which are often cheaper and more effective. These advocates cite numerous research findings indicating that retention offers no clear advantages and may even cause harm, with any short-term gains from retention often diminishing over time.

The harms of grade retention, as cited by critics, include:
* Increased dropout rates over time among repeaters. For instance, studies by Allenseorth (2005) and Frey (2005) highlight that in Minnesota schools, dropout rates for retained students nearly doubled compared to non-repeaters—12.4% for non-repeaters and 27.2% for retained students.
* A lack of evidence supporting long-term academic benefits for retained students.
* Higher rates of mental disorders and dangerous behaviors, such as drinking, drug use, crime, teenage pregnancy, depression, and suicide among repeaters compared to similarly performing promoted students.
* Feelings of isolation from peers due to being in different age groups, which can lead to bullying, fewer friendships, and ridicule.

Critics of retention also point out its financial burden on school systems, as having a student repeat a grade adds an extra year of schooling for that individual, provided they do not drop out. Additionally, some parents express concern that older retained students may victimize younger students.

==Cons==
Opponents of social promotion argue that it deprives children of a proper education. When socially promoted students reach higher levels of education, they may be unprepared, fail courses, and struggle to make normal progress towards graduation.

They believe social promotion has the following negative impacts:
* Students who must wait until the end of the school year to move on to more advanced studies are denied immediate success.
* Students promoted to a class for which they are unprepared are set up for further failure.
* Students may experience so many easy successes in subsequent years that their study habits deteriorate, or they become frustrated with trivial lessons, leading them to drop out.
* Students may face numerous failures in later years, which frustrates them and increases their dropout risk.
* Their frustration with &quot;baby classes&quot; can lead to classroom disruptions or the humiliation of others.
* Their frustration can cause disruptions that lower the achievement of their classmates.
* It sends the message to all students that hard work is unnecessary for progression.
* It forces the next teacher to handle a mix of prepared and underprepared students, complicating the teaching process.
* It gives parents and students a false sense of the child&#x27;s academic progress.
* It creates social cliques among same-age peers, which can result in peer pressure, bullying, and drug abuse.

Some argue that most elementary school students do not take their education seriously, making retention less effective. Since middle school students tend to value education more, retention should be used when they are judged not to have adequate skills before entering high school.

It is also argued that social promotion, by preventing elementary students from advancing at their own pace, is a key reason why they do not take their education seriously. Eliminating the social promotion system could make the incentives of merit-based promotion more effective early in each student&#x27;s academic journey.

== Statistics ==
In the United States, grade retention is more common among boys and non-white students compared to girls and white students. By the time students reach high school, the retention rate for boys is about ten percentage points higher than for girls. In the early grades, retention rates are similar among white Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. However, by high school, the retention rate is about 15 percentage points higher for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites. Across all grades, Black students are three times more likely to be retained than white students, while Hispanics are twice as likely.

There are arguments both for and against social promotion and retention. Social promotion may disadvantage students who have not learned the material, while grade retention can lead to social issues because retained students are older than their peers. African American boys are the group most often retained in school. By the ages of 15–17, 50% of African American boys are either below their peers&#x27; grade level or have dropped out of school, whereas only 30% of white girls aged 15–17 are below the modal grade of their peers.

In 1999, educational researcher Robert M. Hauser commented on the New York City school district&#x27;s plan to end social promotion: &quot;In its plan to end social promotion, the administration appears to have [included] ... an enforcement provision—flunking kids by the carload lot—about which the great mass of evidence is strongly negative. And this policy will hurt poor and minority children most of all.&quot;

A study of 99,000 Florida students by Jay P. Greene and Marcus A. Winters found that &quot;retained students slightly outperformed socially promoted students in reading in the first year after retention, and these gains increased substantially in the second year. Results were robust across two distinct IV comparisons: an across-year approach comparing students who were essentially separated by the year they happened to have been born, and a regression discontinuity design.&quot;

== History ==
With the proliferation of graded schools in the mid-19th century, grade retention, along with mid-term promotions, became common practices. In fact, about a century ago, approximately half of all American students were retained at least once before the age of 13.

Social promotion began to spread in the 1930s, alongside growing concerns about the psychosocial effects of retention. This trend reversed in the 1980s as concerns about declining academic standards increased.

The practice of grade retention in the U.S. has steadily climbed since the 1980s, although local educational agencies may or may not follow this trend. For example, in 1982, New York City schools eliminated social promotions. However, the problems caused by this policy change led the city to reinstate social promotion. In 1999, the city again eliminated social promotion, but it was reinstated after the number of repeaters reached 100,000 by 2004, driving up costs and leading to cutbacks in numerous programs, including those designed to help underachievers.

==Alternatives==
Apart from social promotion, there is grade retention, in which students repeat a grade if judged to be low performers. Grade retention aims to help students learn and sharpen skills such as organization, management, study skills, literacy, and academics, which are crucial before advancing to the next grade, college, and the labor force.

In the U.S., simple social promotion is not considered an adequate alternative to grade retention. Current theories among academic scholars suggest addressing underperformance with remedial help. Students with specific needs or disabilities require special teaching approaches, equipment, or care within or outside a regular classroom. Since students with intellectual disabilities are handled separately, schools may treat two students with identical achievements differently if one student is low-performing due to a disability while the other is typically developing but also underperforming.

In addition to social promotion, there is merit promotion, which can be implemented through mid-term promotion or a course-based curriculum with a directed acyclic graph of prerequisites similar to college curricula. This alternative allows each student to advance at their own pace and could save school districts money by ending the practice of warehousing &quot;talented and gifted students,&quot; enabling these students to graduate early.

<text>Vladimir Viktorovich Smirnov (, ; 20 May 1954 – 29 July 1982) was a Soviet foil and épée fencer. He was the 1980 Olympic champion in men&#x27;s foil, and the 1981 world champion in men&#x27;s foil. He was killed accidentally in a bout during the 1982 World Fencing Championships in Rome, Italy.

==Early life==
Smirnov was born in Rubizhne, Ukrainian SSR, in the Soviet Union.

==Fencing career==
At the 1979 Summer Universiade in Ciudad de México Smirnov won a gold medal in foil team, and a silver medal in individual foil. At the 1981 Summer Universiade in București he won a gold medal in individual foil, and a silver medal in foil team.

At the 1977 World Fencing Championships in Buenos Aires he won a bronze medal in foil team, and at the 1978 World Fencing Championships in Hamburg Smirnov again won a bronze medal in foil team. At the 1979 World Fencing Championships in Melbourne he won a gold medal in foil team, and at the 1981 World Fencing Championships in Clermont-Ferrand he won gold medals in both individual foil and foil team. At the 1982 World Fencing Championships in Rome he was awarded the gold medal in foil team.

Smirnov won the gold medal in individual men&#x27;s foil at the 1980 Summer Olympics, as well as a silver medal in foil team and a bronze medal in épée team.

==Death==
During the 1982 World Fencing Championships in Rome, Italy, in the team foil event the 28-year-old world champion Smirnov, ranked #1 in the world, was fencing 27-year-old Matthias Behr of West Germany, ranked #2 in the world, on 19 July in the quarter-finals of the team event. The two fencers initiated a simultaneous attack. Behr&#x27;s foil blade broke during the action, and the jagged broken blade penetrated through the mesh of Smirnov&#x27;s fencing mask, through his left eye orbit, and into the frontal lobe of his brain.

An Agostino Gemelli University Policlinic spokesman said &quot;Smirnov&#x27;s heart is still functioning, but other bodily functions are being maintained by artificial means.&quot; State-run television said he was &quot;clinically dead&quot;. A later communique from the hospital said he was in a deep coma, was not responding to treatment, and had no brain reflexes.

Smirnov died nine days later. He was buried in Kyiv, where he had been living.

===Aftermath===
Smirnov&#x27;s accident was the driving force behind the significant improvement of safety gear in fencing. For example, the use of maraging steel blades (less likely to break than the carbon steel ones of the day), kevlar (or other ballistic nylon) in the uniforms, and masks two to three times stronger than the one he wore, all came about because of his death. The improvements greatly decreased the number of severe injuries in fencing, making it one of the safest competitive sports in the world. A five-year study by Willamette University sports science professor Dr. Peter Harmer in 2005 found that fencing is especially safe for children and novices; that soccer was 14 times more dangerous than fencing, and basketball 10 times more dangerous, and that of the 22 sports examined in the study, fencing was tied with golf as having the lowest risk to competitors.

Forty years later, amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Behr called Smirnov&#x27;s former wife in Ukraine, and gave her son-in-law and two grandchildren refuge during the war.

<text>The spectacled porpoise (Phocoena dioptrica) is a small to midsize porpoise indigenous to the Southern Ocean. It is one of the most poorly studied cetaceans, partly due to its remote range in the Southern Ocean. What little is known about this porpoise species has been gathered mainly from stranded individuals, and a few observations of living animals made at sea.

The species was first described in 1912 by Fernando Lahille.

==Description==
As with other porpoise species, the spectacled porpoise has no beak. It has small pectoral fins with rounded tips positioned far forward on the body, and a triangular dorsal fin. This porpoise species shows obvious sexual dimorphism between adult males and females, as the dorsal fins in males are much larger and more rounded than those of females.
Records for female length range up to , while males may reach , which represents the largest specimen documented thus far. The maximum weight for a female was , while a male has been recorded at .

The spectacled porpoise has a distinctive coloration. As an adult it is countershaded, with a black dorsal region which is sharply delineated from a white belly. In some individuals, this line can be feathered. An obvious dark eye patch is present in both juveniles and adults. A pale ‘saddle-patch’ around the dorsal fin and a dark line around the blowhole have also been documented. Females are described as lighter in coloration, while young animals may have a dorsal area that is grey rather than black, with a lighter grey on the belly, a clearly demarked line connecting the mouth and flipper.

==Geographic distribution ==
The distribution of the spectacled porpoise is thought to be circumpolar, and it is considered a predominately oceanic species, however occasional sightings and specimens are documented in coastal regions. Evidence from sightings and strandings suggest that the species can be found within cool temperate, sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters, where water temperatures range between .

Stranded individuals have been found across the southern hemisphere. In the south-western Atlantic records have been made at Santa Catarina in Southern Brazil, Uruguay, from Buenos Aires to Tierra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. Records exist from the south-western South Pacific (Auckland and Maquarie Islands) to the southern Indian Ocean (Heard and Kerguelen), and also from New Zealand, Burney Island, Tasmania and South Australia. This widespread distribution is evidence of a circumpolar range, and possible association with the Falkland Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) which transports cold water along the Atlantic coast of South America, and around Antarctica respectively.

Sightings of spectacled porpoise at sea are similarly widespread, and include waters off Patagonia, South Georgia, Kerguelen, south of New Zealand, Tasmania and Heard Island. Nine sightings have been made south of 64°, in Antarctic waters.

==Foraging==
Little dietary information is available for the spectacled porpoise, but it is thought to forage on fish and squid. No observations of foraging behaviour at sea have been made. Stomach contents from a small number of stranded specimens included anchovy (&quot;Engraulis sp.&quot;), stomatopods, cephalopod beaks (&quot;Sepia sp.&quot;) and a half digested ornate cowfish (&quot;Aracana ornata&quot;).

==Reproduction==
Little is known about the reproduction of the spectacled porpoise. In the Tierra del Fuego region, studies estimate that young porpoises are born at long in late spring or summer (November to February). No information is available on gestation, lactation, or inter-birth intervals.

==Taxonomy==
The species was named by the French-born Argentinian zoologist Fernando Lahille in 1912 for its two distinctive black eye patches, with the latin dioptrica meaning ‘spectacled’. In Spanish, the spectacled porpoise is known as &#x27;marsopa de anteojos&#x27;, a literal translation of the English common name. Recent analyses of mitochondrial DNA from 50 porpoises indicated high levels of genetic diversity that would indicate a large and stable population, or one with a wide distribution. The study also revealed evidence for a recent expansion in population.

Phylogenetic tree analyses found that spectacled porpoises are more closely related to Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoena spinipinnis&quot;) than to the vaquita (&quot;Phocoena sinus&quot;) which appeared to diverge from Burmeister’s and spectacled porpoises in the Pliocene era. These three species diverged from the harbour porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;) and Dall’s porpoise ( &quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;) around 4 million years ago, while the split between Burmeister’s and spectacled porpoises occurred 2.3 million years ago.

==Population status==
The population size and its inter-connectedness across the Southern Ocean is unknown. Research cruises conducted between 1978 and 2004 in the Antarctic resulted in 28 sightings, however these were made in fair weather conditions and porpoises may have been missed during poorer conditions. It is possible that Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for spectacled porpoises may shed more light on their range and habitat use, however no studies have been conducted to date.

==Threats==
The spectacled porpoise is likely prey for sharks, leopard seals (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;) and killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;). In Tierra del Fuego, it has been observed that scavenging birds such as kelp gulls will target stranded spectacled porpoise carcasses over other cetacean species. Such scavenging can result in a carcass becoming skeletonised rapidly, within one to two hours.

Researchers have uncovered spectacled porpoise remains within the kitchen middens of the canoe people who lived in Tierra del Fuego between 6000 and 1400 years ago. It is possible the species was once a common food source for peoples in the region. More recently, porpoises may be caught and used as bait for the crab fishery industry, however the frequency of this activity and its impact on porpoise population status is unknown.

Bycatch and incidental capture are most likely the greatest anthropogenic threat to the spectacled porpoise. Porpoises and other small cetaceans are particularly at risk of entanglement and drowning in gillnets, as the thin filaments are not easily detected by their echolocation clicks. The extent of incidental bycatch is unknown, however strandings and fishing ground locations often coincide.

==Conservation status==

While previously listed by the IUCN in 2008 as ‘Data Deficient’ the species was upgraded to ‘Least Concern’ in 2018. While it is widely accepted that spectacled porpoises are threatened by fishery bycatch and entanglement, and stranding rates in Tierra del Fuego may be unsustainable for the population, the category of Least Concern has been applied provisionally until more data is available.

==Captivity==

At least two incidents have been documented where a living spectacled porpoise was taken into captivity, in both cases for medical treatment and rehabilitation following stranding. The first individual was a very young 127 cm long female calf that stranded in Port Elliot, Southern Australia, on 24 March 1997. The calf was disorientated and exhausted, preventing refloating attempts, and rescuers subsequently transported the calf to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) marine rescue unit in Adelaide. The porpoise died five days later on 29 March 1997, and a necropsy revealed damage to the oesophagus and first stomach caused by intubation during force-feeding. However, other organs were normal and no direct cause of death was determined.

The second incident occurred on 26 January 2019, where an adult male live stranded 30 km up a river estuary in Argentina. The porpoise was emaciated and dehydrated, and was taken to the Marine Fauna Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre. The animal died four days later on 30 January 2019.

<doc id="327843" wikidata="Q510526" url="?curid=327843" title="Olaf Kölzig">
<text>Olaf Kölzig (born 6 April 1970) is a South African-born German professional ice hockey goaltender and current goaltender coach and player development coach for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). With the exception of eight games with the Tampa Bay Lightning, he played his entire 14-year NHL career with the Capitals.

Nicknamed &quot;Olie the Goalie&quot;, Kölzig was born in South Africa to German parents and grew up in several cities across Canada. His family moved to Union Bay, British Columbia, when he was a teenager. Kölzig never applied for Canadian citizenship, which allowed him to represent Germany internationally. Kölzig ranks among the NHL&#x27;s top 30 in career saves (15th with 18,233), wins (28th with 303), games (23rd with 719), and minutes (23rd with 41,671).

==Playing career==

Kölzig played major junior hockey for the New Westminster Bruins and Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League (WHL). During his time with the Americans, he had an on-ice fistfight with Portland Winter Hawks goaltender Byron Dafoe, who also settled in the Comox Valley with his family at a young age. The two later became teammates and friendly rivals in the NHL, each serving as the other&#x27;s best man for their respective weddings. On 29 November 1989, Kölzig scored a goal while playing for Tri-City.

The Capitals selected Kölzig in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. Kölzig played his first NHL game in the 1989–90 NHL season, but was sent down to the minors where he remained for several years. He spent several years in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Baltimore Skipjacks, Rochester Americans, and Portland Pirates, and one year with the Hampton Roads Admirals of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). In 1994, as a member of the Pirates, he won both the 1994 Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as MVP of the AHL playoffs, and the 1994 Hap Holmes Memorial Award.

During the 1995–96 NHL season, the Capitals recalled Kölzig to serve as backup for Jim Carey. When the Capitals acquired Bill Ranford from the Boston Bruins for the 1996–97 NHL season, Kölzig remained as backup. In Washington&#x27;s first game of the 1997-98 season, Ranford suffered an injury and Kölzig took over. Kölzig played well for the rest of the season, winning a total of 33 games and achieving a 2.20 goals against average. He backstopped the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals, being one of only 21 goalies in NHL history to record four shutouts in one postseason. Despite his success, the Capitals were swept in the finals by the defending champions, the Detroit Red Wings.

In 2000, Kölzig won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best goalie after going 41–20–11 with a 2.24 GAA and five shutouts. Kölzig also has the distinction of being one of four goaltenders to play a scoreless period during an NHL All-Star Game, which he did in 2000. He also played in the 1998 All-Star Game, in which he made 14 saves on 17 shots. During the 2004–05 NHL lock-out he signed with the German club Eisbären Berlin.

On 11 February 2006, Kölzig signed a two-year, $10.9 million extension with the Capitals. In February 2007, in the midst of a 19–19–5 season, Kölzig tore his medial collateral ligament (MCL). Prior to this injury, Kölzig had missed only 18 games and never more than four in a row.
In February 2008, the Capitals acquired goalie Cristobal Huet, who gradually took over as starting goaltender. Despite this, on 12 March Kölzig became the twenty-third goalie to win 300 games. The Capitals qualified for the playoffs, and Huet started every game in their first round series against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Capitals lost in seven games. A few weeks after their elimination, Kölzig announced he did not intend to return to the team. At the time, he was the last remaining Capital to have worn the original red, white and blue uniform and the blue jersey from 1995.

On 1 July 2008, Kölzig became an unrestricted free agent and signed a $1.5 million, 1-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he served as the back-up goalie to Mike Smith. Upon Kölzig&#x27;s return to D.C. as a member of Tampa Bay, he was loudly cheered and a video in tribute to his time with the Caps was shown. On 28 January 2009, it was announced that Kölzig would miss the rest of the 2008–09 season due to a ruptured biceps tendon in his left arm.

Kölzig was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with Jamie Heward, Andy Rogers and a 4th round pick on 4 March 2009 as part of a trade deadline deal for Richard Petiot. As he was at that time suffering from an injury that would see him out for the rest of the 2008–09 season, the end of which would also see his contract expire, his acquisition from Tampa Bay was largely seen as an effort by Toronto general manager Brian Burke to &quot;buy&quot; the 4th round pick by taking on Kölzig&#x27;s deadweight salary.

On 23 September 2009, Kölzig announced his retirement from the NHL. Later that year, Kölzig was named to the ECHL Hall of Fame at the 2010 ECHL All-Star Game in Ontario, California.

The Capitals have not issued Kölzig&#x27;s number 37 since his retirement.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Kölzig and fellow Tri-City Americans alumnus Stu Barnes became part of an ownership group in their former major junior team, assuring the existence of the Americans in Kennewick, Washington.

Kölzig is known for his service off the ice as well as his accomplishments on the ice. Along with fellow NHLers Byron Dafoe and Scott Mellanby, he founded Athletes Against Autism to raise awareness of autism and encourage more research, as well as the Carson Kolzig Foundation for Youth Autism in honour of his son, who is autistic. Because of his local and national service, he was awarded the NHL&#x27;s King Clancy Memorial Trophy for humanitarian service in 2006, named one of the 10 Washingtonians of the Year by Washingtonian Magazine in 2000, and one of only four non-Canadian winners to receive the NHL Foundation Player Award. In 2004, the Capitals held a vote for fans to determine the top 30 players in the franchise history to celebrate their 30th season in the league. Kölzig&#x27;s 2,038 votes led all players.

Kölzig is married with three children. Growing up, Kölzig was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

==International play==
Kölzig was also the starting goalie for the German Olympic team at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, recording a 1.00 GAA and went 2–0. He played for Germany at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and went 0–3 with a 3.34 GAA. Kölzig also started in goal for Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

<text>Narnia is a fantasy world created by C. S. Lewis as the primary location for his series of seven fantasy novels for children, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. The world is named after the country of Narnia, where much of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; takes place.

In Narnia, some animals talk, mythical beasts abound, and magic is common. The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans, usually children, enter the Narnian world from Earth. The entire Narnian timeline, from its creation to its end (), ran parallel to 49 Earth-years (), thus on average a year on Earth meant 52.14 time dilation years in Narnia.

== Inspiration ==

The landscape of Lewis&#x27;s native Ireland, in particular his native Ulster, now modern day Northern Ireland for most parts, played a large part in the creation of the Narnian landscape. In his essay &quot;On Stories&quot;, Lewis wrote . In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide . Although in adult life Lewis lived in England, he returned to Ulster often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery, saying 

Beginning in 1906, young C.S. Lewis (1898–1963) visited the northern Irish seaside near Portrush in the north of County Antrim many times. In later years, Lewis remembered the sounds of the sea, the cliffs rising above it, and the ruined medieval towers of Dunluce Castle which many authors have speculated may have inspired his creation of Cair Paravel.

=== Narnia and Narni, Italy ===
Concerning Narnia and Narni, Roger Lancelyn Green writes about C.S. Lewis and Walter Hooper:
== Fictional geography ==
=== Narnia ===

The novels revolve around the fantastical country of Narnia. The nation of Narnia, often and officially the Kingdom of Narnia, was guarded over by Aslan, the Great Lion, and was filled with humans, talking animals, and other mythical creatures. Narnia was a land of rolling hills rising into low mountains to the south, and was predominantly forested, except for marshlands in the north. There are a few known entrances to Narnia, these entrances include the iconic wardrobe from The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, The cave from Prince Caspian, The painting from Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the door at Experiment house and the cave that was mentioned at the end of Prince Caspian where the Telmarines came from (it is also believed that that cave was a forever access) and much more locations. The country is bordered on the east by the Eastern Ocean, on the west by a great mountain range, on the north by the River Shribble, and on the south by Archenland.

The economic heart of the country centres on the Great River of Narnia, which crosses the country from the northwest on an east-southeasterly course to the Eastern Ocean. The seat of government is the castle of Cair Paravel, originally on a peninsula, later an island, at the mouth of the Great River on the coast of the Great Eastern Ocean. Other communities along the river include (from east to west):

* Beruna: One of four named towns in the country of Narnia. Beruna grew as a strategic location because of the fords on the Great River of Narnia that were located there. When Narnia was conquered by the Telmarines, a town was built at the Fords of Beruna and a bridge over the river was constructed. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, Susan Pevensie and Lucy Pevensie accompany Aslan to the bridge, and Bacchus destroys it at the request of the river-god (&quot;Loose my chains&quot;).
* Beaversdam: A community named after the dam in the area built by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who met (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) on their arrival in Narnia, and led three of them to the Stone Table to meet Aslan, while Edmund betrayed them to the White Witch and was later rescued by Aslan&#x27;s followers. These events were a key point in (LWW). The name kept alive memory of the beavers, though in later times they became extinct in Narnia. The community developed some time between then and the Telmarine conquest (unless the Telmarines named it after the &quot;Old Narnian&quot; story of the Pevensies&#x27;, which is unlikely), but it still existed under the Telmarine rule and seemed to have hosted a majority of the Telmarine-descent population. At the time when the usurper Miraz purged the aristocracy of anyone who might threaten his rule, two brothers who were the lords of Beaversdam were locked up as &quot;madmen&quot; (PC)
* Chippingford: One of four towns named in the country of Narnia. It is mentioned briefly at the start of &quot;The Last Battle&quot; when Shift the Ape sends Puzzle the donkey there to buy oranges and bananas. It is a British English name, made up as if derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Cēapungford&quot; which means &quot;market ford&quot;. (LB)

=== Archenland ===

Archenland is a mountainous country south of Narnia. It is bordered on the north by Narnia and on the south by the Winding Arrow River and further south is the Great Desert. The seat of government is at Anvard, in the heart of the country, a fortified area.

=== Calormen ===

Calormen is a semi-arid empire in the south of the world of Narnia. The capital of Calormen is Tashbaan, located on an island near the mouth of the River of Calormen, which flows from west to east in the north of Calormen, just south of the Great Desert. The city of Azim Balda, to the south of Tashbaan, is a hub where many roads meet; it hosts the government&#x27;s postal system. &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; describes slave trade between Calormen and Telmar from areas far south of Calormen.

=== Northern Countries ===
North of Narnia lies Ettinsmoor, a cold barren plain home to the once civilized, now anarchistic giants. North of Ettinsmoor is a deep gorge crossed by an ancient bridge known simply as the &quot;Giant Bridge&quot;, part of a long-abandoned road. This leads to the Wild Lands of the North, home of the Ruined City of the Giants and the castle Harfang, which is still inhabited by giants.

=== Eastern Ocean ===
East of Narnia is the Great Eastern Ocean, where the Bight of Calormen is home to the Merpeople and the islands of Galma, Terebinthia, Seven Isles, and the Lone Islands. Beyond the Bight of Calormen is more ocean, including the islands of Dragon Island, Burnt Island, Death Water Island, Island of the Duffers, Dark Island, and the Island of the Star. Beyond the Island of the Star, is another undersea country called the Eastern Last Sea, the water of white lilies known as the Silver Sea, and the Utter East, which is a small plain, bordering a perpetual wave and the high mountains of Aslan&#x27;s Country.

=== Western Lands ===
To Narnia&#x27;s west is the landlocked Western Wild, south of this country and also west of Calormen is the Far West region, and somewhere beyond this is Telmar, and eventually on the other side of the unnamed continent is the Western Sea. The Western Sea is an uncharted territory of the Narnian world, but some claim that on its islands are .

=== Underground ===
Deep below Narnia&#x27;s surface is a dark sunless country Underland and even deeper than that, at the world&#x27;s base, is the fiery nation of Bism, home to the Gnomes and Salamanders.

== Fictional cosmology ==
In the domed sky are the sun and moon, which rise from the Utter East and set in the Utter West. The Last Sea in the east is bright with a &quot;drinkable light&quot;. There are stars and planets in the sky but in the Narnian world they are people who move accordingly, and some live on the surface.

The flat world of Narnia is connected to Earth and many other worlds through a nexus called the Wood between the Worlds. Travel is possible through a pool each for every world. The Wood is so named by Polly Plummer, who is transported there when Digory Kirke&#x27;s Uncle Andrew tricks her into picking up a magic yellow ring. It has a slothful influence on those travelling it, which is explained by C.S. Lewis as the Wood being a place where nothing ever happens, unlike the different worlds that it connects. For the child protagonists, this experience is pleasant and relaxing. However, it affects the White Witch Jadis negatively: she shrieks in despair that the wood is &quot;killing&quot; her, and she is sickly and pale. It could be described as a nexus of sorts, existing outside the other worlds and not being a world on its own. The wood derives its name from &quot;The Wood Beyond the World&quot;, a fantasy novel by William Morris, an author who Lewis greatly admired. However, the location&#x27;s function stems from another Morris novel, &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;. Some scholars have suggested Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or Algnernon Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;The Education of Uncle Paul&quot;, both of which Lewis was known to have enjoyed, as possible secondary influences.

== Fictional timeline ==
Lewis provided a timeline of events related to &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, in emulation of &quot;The Tale of the Years&quot; chronology in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He gave an &quot;Outline of Narnian History&quot; in manuscript form to Walter Hooper, who included it in his essay &quot;Past Watchful Dragons: The Fairy Tales of C. S. Lewis&quot;. The novels never explicitly mention the year or years in which events take place, so the timeline is the only source for this information. Kathryn Lindskoog, along with other Lewis scholars, has challenged the authenticity of some posthumous works attributed to Lewis and edited by Hooper, but the validity of the outline in particular has not been questioned. The outline is accepted by Lewis experts and has been included in works by Paul Ford, Martha Sammons and others.

=== Consistency with other works ===
Several people have pointed out more or less significant areas where Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Outline&quot; is not consistent with the text of the &quot;Chronicles&quot;. For example, the &quot;outline&quot; dates Queen Swanwhite , though according to &quot;The Last Battle&quot; she ruled Narnia before Jadis returned (meaning that her reign must have ended before 898). Paul Ford, author of &quot;Companion to Narnia&quot;, points out that the text of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age; the years given in the timeline for their births, 1930 and 1932 respectively, which unless Edmund was born near the end of December of 1930, and Lucy was born near the beginning of January 1932, would put their ages at something more than a year. Devin Brown, author of &quot;Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,&quot; uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan&#x27;s appearances in Narnia with other characters&#x27; recollections of those appearances.

<doc id="327853" wikidata="Q646929" url="?curid=327853" title="Armando Iannucci">
<text>Armando Giovanni Iannucci (; born 28 November 1963) is a Scottish satirist, writer, director, producer, performer, and panellist. 

Born in Glasgow to Italian parents, Iannucci studied at the University of Glasgow followed by the University of Oxford. Starting on BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, his early work with Chris Morris on the radio series &quot;On the Hour&quot; transferred to television as &quot;The Day Today&quot;. 

A character from this series, Alan Partridge, co-created by Iannucci, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci&#x27;s television and radio programmes, including &quot;Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;. Iannucci also fronted the satirical &quot;Armistice&quot; review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, &quot;The Armando Iannucci Shows&quot;, for Channel 4.

Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom &quot;The Thick of It&quot; and the spoof documentary &quot;Time Trumpet&quot; in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, in 2009 he directed a critically acclaimed feature film, &quot;In the Loop&quot;, featuring characters from &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. As a result of these works, he has been described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;the hardman of political satire&quot;. Other works during this period include an operetta libretto, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, and his radio series &quot;Charm Offensive&quot;. Iannucci created the HBO political satire &quot;Veep&quot;, and was its showrunner for four seasons from 2012 to 2015. 

For his work on &quot;Veep&quot; he won two Emmys in 2015, Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. He followed this with the feature films &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot; in 2017 and &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;, a 2019 adaptation of the novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. In 2020, he created the comedy series &quot;Avenue 5&quot; on HBO.

== Early life ==
Iannucci was born in Glasgow. His father, also called Armando, was from Naples, while his mother was born in Glasgow to an Italian family. Before emigrating, Iannucci&#x27;s father wrote for an anti-fascist newspaper as a teenager and joined the Italian partisans at 17. He moved to Scotland in 1950 and ran a pizza factory in Springburn in Glasgow.

Iannucci has two brothers and a sister. His childhood home was near that of actor Peter Capaldi, who went on to play Malcolm Tucker in &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, a TV show created by Iannucci. Although their parents knew each other well, he and Capaldi did not know each other in childhood. In his teens, Iannucci thought seriously about becoming a Roman Catholic priest.

Iannucci was educated at St Peter&#x27;s Primary School, St. Aloysius&#x27; College, Glasgow, the University of Glasgow and University College, Oxford, where he studied English literature. He was writing a DPhil thesis about 17th-century religious language, with particular reference to Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which he abandoned to follow a comedy career. He was particularly inspired by the American comedian and filmmaker Woody Allen, later calling him his &quot;all-time comedy hero&quot;.

== Career ==
===1990s===
After making several programmes at BBC Scotland in the early 1990s such as the &quot;No&#x27; The Archie McPherson Show&quot;, he moved to BBC Radio in London, making radio shows including &quot;Armando Iannucci&quot; for BBC Radio 1, which featured comedians he was to collaborate with for many years, including David Schneider, Peter Baynham, Steve Coogan and Rebecca Front.

Iannucci first received widespread fame as the producer for &quot;On the Hour&quot; on Radio 4, which transferred to television as &quot;The Day Today&quot;. He received critical acclaim for both his own talents as a writer and a producer, and for first bringing together such comics as Chris Morris, Richard Herring, Stewart Lee, Baynham and Coogan. The members of this group went on to work on separate projects and create a new comedy &quot;wave&quot; pre-New Labour: Morris went on to create &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, &quot;Blue Jam&quot; and the &quot;Chris Morris Music Show&quot;; Stewart Lee and Richard Herring created &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; and &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;.

Baynham was closely involved with both Morris&#x27;s and Lee &amp; Herring&#x27;s work. Lee would go on to co-write &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, and wrote early material for Coogan&#x27;s character Alan Partridge, who first appeared in &quot;On the Hour&quot;, and has featured in multiple spin-off series. Between 1995 and 1999, Iannucci produced and hosted &quot;The Saturday Night Armistice&quot;.

===2000s===
In 2000, he created two pilot episodes for Channel 4, which became &quot;The Armando Iannucci Shows&quot;. This was an eight-part series for Channel 4 broadcast in 2001, written with Andy Riley and Kevin Cecil. The series consisted of Iannucci pondering pseudo-philosophical and jocular ideas and fantasies in between surreal sketches. Iannucci has been quoted as saying it is the comedy series he is most proud of making. He told &quot;Metro&quot; in April 2007: &quot;&quot;The Armando Iannucci Show&quot; on Channel 4 came out around 9/11, so it was overlooked for good reasons. People had other things on their minds. But that was the closest to me expressing my comic outlook on life.&quot;

After championing &quot;Yes Minister&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, Iannucci devised, directed and was chief writer of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, a political satire-cum-farce for BBC Four. It starred Chris Langham as an incompetent cabinet minister being manipulated by a cynical, foul-mouthed Press Officer, Malcolm Tucker. It was first broadcast for two short series on BBC Four in 2005, initially with a small cast focusing on a government minister, his advisers and their party&#x27;s spin-doctor. The cast was significantly expanded for two hour-long specials to coincide with Christmas and Gordon Brown&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister in 2007, which saw new characters forming the opposition party added to the cast. These characters continued when the show switched channels to BBC Two for its third series in 2009. A fourth series about a coalition government was broadcast in 2012. In a 2012 interview, Iannucci said the fourth series of the programme would probably be its last.

Based on a format he had used in &quot;&quot; in 1996 and &quot;2004: The Stupid Version&quot;, in mid-2006, his spoof documentary series &quot;Time Trumpet&quot; was shown on BBC 2. The series looked back on past events through highly edited clips and &quot;celebrity&quot; interviews, looking back on the present and near-future from the year 2031. One episode, featuring fictional terrorist attacks on London and the assassination of Tony Blair, was postponed and edited in August 2006 amid the terrorism scares in British airports at that time. Jane Thynne, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, accused the BBC of lacking backbone.

He created the American HBO political satire television series &quot;Veep&quot;, starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, set in the office of Selina Meyer, a fictional Vice-President of the United States. &quot;Veep&quot; uses a similar cinéma-vérité filming style to &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. Debuting in 2012, the show has aired seven seasons, winning multiple awards including seventeen Primetime Emmy Awards. However, beginning with season five, Iannucci stepped down as showrunner due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

In 2019, he began work on a new science fiction sitcom for HBO called &quot;Avenue 5,&quot; which premiered in 2020 He subsequently became the series executive producer and directed the pilot.

===Other work===
Iannucci&#x27;s non-television works include &quot;Smokehammer&quot;, a web-based project with Chris Morris, and the 1997 book &quot;Facts and Fancies&quot;, composed of his newspaper columns, which was turned into a BBC Radio 4 series. The radio series &quot;Scraps With Iannucci&quot;, which followed late in 1998, featured Iannucci using his tape-fiddling skills to present a review of the year.

In 2007, he directed a series of Post Office television adverts, featuring the actors John Henshaw, Rory Jennings and Di Botcher alongside guest stars Joan Collins, Bill Oddie and Westlife.

He has appeared on Radio 3 talking about classical music, one of his passions, and collaborated with composer David Sawer on &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, an operetta, which was premiered by Opera North on 16 January 2009. He has also presented three programmes for BBC Radio 3, including &quot;Mobiles Off!&quot;, a 20-minute segment on classical concert-going etiquette. He was a regular columnist for the classical music magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot;. A book of his writings about classical music &quot;Hear Me Out&quot; was published in 2017.

In 2012 it was reported that he was writing his first novel, &quot;Tongue International&quot;, a satirical fantasy about the promotion of a &quot;for-profit language&quot;.

In July 2023, Iannucci announced that he was working on a stage adaptation of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s classic Cold War satire &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.&quot; Sean Foley will direct, and Iannucci&#x27;s longtime collaborator Steve Coogan will be starring in multiple roles.

===Film directing===
In January 2009, his first feature film &quot;In the Loop&quot;, in the style of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. It was the first cinema film to be directed by Iannucci, after his contribution to &quot;Tube Tales&quot; in 1999. The film was applauded by critics, both in Britain and the US, and was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2009. The film secured the eighth highest placing in the UK box office in its opening week – despite its relatively insignificant screening numbers.

His second feature film was &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot;, about the power struggle which followed the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. It was released in October 2017 in the United Kingdom. The film was banned in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan for allegedly mocking the countries&#x27; pasts and making fun of their leaders. However, it received a Magritte Award nomination in the category of Best Foreign Film and was a critical success.

His third feature film was an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot; entitled &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;. It was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2020 and received critical acclaim.

==Recognition==
Iannucci has won two Sony Radio Awards and three British Comedy Awards. In 2003, he was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. He was also subject of a 2006 edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

In January 2006 he was named News International Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media at the University of Oxford, where he has delivered a series of four lectures under the title &quot;British Comedy – Dead Or Alive?&quot;.

In June 2011, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Glasgow to recognise his contribution to film and television.

At the 2011 British Comedy Awards, Iannucci received the Writers&#x27; Guild of Britain Award.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. Alastair Campbell&#x27;s response to his appointment was &quot;Three little letters can have more impact than you realise&quot;, to which Iannucci replied, via Twitter, &quot;WMD&quot; (a reference to Campbell&#x27;s role in preparing the &quot;September Dossier&quot; prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq).

In July 2012 Iannucci received an honorary Doctorate (DLitt) from the University of Exeter.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to film and television.

==Politics==
In the 2010 general election Iannucci supported the Liberal Democrats, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ll be voting Lib Dem this election because they represent the best chance in a lifetime to make lasting and fair change to how the UK is governed.&quot; After the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition of 2010 was established, however, he expressed doubts over his continued support for the party, saying he was &#x27;wavering&#x27; on many issues and has admitted to &#x27;queasiness&#x27; over the Coalition&#x27;s economic measures. He also seemed to contemplate targeting the Liberal Democrats in the fourth series of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, rather as the first three had targeted what he perceived as the failings within the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

In July 2018, Iannucci announced his support on Twitter for People&#x27;s Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. He also expressed these views the following month in an editorial in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and they went on to be reported in other British newspapers.

==Personal life==
In 1990, he married Rachel Jones, whom he met when she designed the lighting for his one-man show at Oxford. They have two sons and one daughter and currently live in Hertfordshire.

He is a former patron of the Silver Star Society, a charity supporting women through difficult pregnancies. In April 2012, as part of his support for the Silver Star Society, he abseiled from the top of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to raise money for the hospital&#x27;s specialist pregnancy unit.

<doc id="327856" wikidata="Q616503" url="?curid=327856" title="Dreadnought hoax">
<text>The &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax was a practical joke pulled by Horace de Vere Cole in 1910. Cole tricked the Royal Navy into showing their flagship, the battleship HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, to a fake delegation of Abyssinian royals. The hoax drew attention in Britain to the emergence of the Bloomsbury Group, among whom some of Cole&#x27;s collaborators numbered. The hoax was a repeat of a similar impersonation that Cole and Adrian Stephen had organised while they were students at Cambridge University in 1905.

==Background==
===Hoaxers===

Horace de Vere Cole was born in Ireland in 1881 to a well-to-do family. He was commissioned into the Yorkshire Hussars and served in the Second Boer War, where he was seriously wounded and invalided out of service. On his return to Britain, he became an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge; he studied little and spent his time entertaining and undertaking hoaxes and pranks.

One of Cole&#x27;s closest friends at Trinity was Adrian Stephen, a keen sportsman and actor. Cole&#x27;s biographer, Martyn Downer, considers that Stephen was a &quot;perfect foil for ... [Cole]: someone sympathetic and encouraging yet unafraid to take him on&quot;. Stephen was the son of Leslie, the writer and critic, and Julia, the philanthropist and Pre-Raphaelite model. Adrian Stephen&#x27;s elder brother, Thoby, was also at Trinity, and their sisters, Vanessa (later Vanessa Bell) and Virginia (later Virginia Woolf), would visit. After university, the four Stephen siblings became members of the Bloomsbury Group, the set of associated writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, many of whose members had also been at Trinity College. Cole was on the fringes of the group but never a member.

===Cambridge Zanzibar hoax===

In early 1905, while in their second year at Trinity College, Cambridge, Cole and Adrian Stephen decided to use a visit to England of Sayyid Ali bin Hamud Al-Busaid, the eighth Sultan of Zanzibar, as the basis for a hoax. A plan was put together to fake a state visit of the sultan to Cambridge, although they realised that as the sultan&#x27;s picture had recently appeared in the press, there was a risk the visiting sultan would be shown as a fraud. They decided that Cole would impersonate the sultan&#x27;s uncle rather than the sultan. On 2 March, they sent a telegram to the Mayor of Cambridge to ask if he could arrange a suitable reception for the sultan:

The students obtained robes and turbans from the theatrical costumier Willy Clarkson, applied blackface make-up and took the train from London. A carriage met the group at Cambridge railway station and took them to the guildhall, where they were met by the mayor and town clerk. After a brief reception they were taken on a tour of the town, including some of the university&#x27;s colleges; the hoaxers were seen by some of their friends and acquaintances who did not recognise them. After less than an hour they demanded to be returned to the station. As they did not want to return to London—returning from which would have meant them breaking the 10:00pm college curfew—on arrival at the station, they ran out of a side exit and took two hansom cabs to a friend&#x27;s house, where they changed back into their normal attire.

The following day Cole gave an interview to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; about the hoax; the story appeared in the paper on 4 March 1905 and was repeated in local newspapers. The &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; considered the events &quot;a most audacious practical joke&quot;. The Mayor wanted the students involved to be , but was persuaded by the Vice-Chancellor that this would damage his reputation further.

===Dreadnoughts and the Royal Navy===

In the early 20th century, Britain&#x27;s naval fleet was seen as one of the foundations of its empire, and a reflection of the country&#x27;s power and wealth. As Britain was portrayed in books, plays and popular culture as an island nation, the Royal Navy was seen as the defender of the island and its first line of defence. A leading article in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1909 described the supremacy of the Royal Navy as &quot;the best security for the world&#x27;s peace and advancement&quot;.

, the first of Britain&#x27;s &quot;dreadnought&quot; class of battleship, entered into Royal Navy service in 1906. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the most technologically advanced ship built; it was better armed, faster and stronger than any other vessel afloat. According to the historian Jan Rüger, from the time the ship was launched, it took on cultural significance as a symbol and it entered into public consciousness through songs and advertising. When the ship visited London in 1909—part of three fleet reviews held—a million people were estimated to have watched its arrival, and by 1910 it &quot;had become a cultural icon with undeniable symbolic status&quot;. Rüger gives examples of advertising for Oxo stock cubes: &quot;Drink OXO and dread nought&quot;; a tailoring business that used the slogan &quot;Dreadnought and wear British clothing&quot;; and &quot;Dreadnought trams&quot; ran, styled as battleships, and complete with imitation guns. The cultural historian Elisa deCourcy describes the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; as having &quot;a near sacrosanct nature&quot; for the Edwardians.

In February 1910 the captain of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was Herbert Richmond; Admiral Sir William May was the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet; as such, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was his flagship. Also present on &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was Commander Willie Fisher—the Stephens&#x27; cousin—who was on the staff of the Admiral.

==Hoax==

In a talk given in 1940 Woolf described how, in 1910, young naval officers enjoyed playing practical jokes on one another:

This involved Cole and five friends—writer Virginia Stephen (later Virginia Woolf), her brother Adrian Stephen, Guy Ridley, Anthony Buxton and the artist Duncan Grant—who had themselves disguised by the theatrical costumier Willy Clarkson with skin darkeners and turbans to resemble members of the Abyssinian royal family. The main limitation of the disguises was that the &quot;royals&quot; could not eat anything or their make-up would be ruined. Adrian Stephen took the role of &quot;interpreter&quot;.

On 7 February 1910 Clarkson&#x27;s employees visited Woolf&#x27;s home and applied the stage make-up to Woolf, Grant, Buxton and Ridley, then provided eastern robes. According to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, they were also wearing £500 of jewellery; Martin Downer, in his biography of Cole, doubts the amount, which is not repeated by any of the participants.

A friend of Stephen&#x27;s sent a telegram to the &quot;C-in-C, Home Fleet&quot; (Commander-in-chief of the vessels defending Britain) stating that &quot;Prince Makalen of Abbysinia &quot;&quot; and suite arrive 4.20 today Weymouth. He wishes to see Dreadnought. Kindly arrange meet them on arrival&quot;; the message was signed &quot;Harding Foreign Office&quot;. Cole had found a post office staffed only by women, as he thought they were less likely to ask questions about the message. Cole, with his entourage, went to London&#x27;s Paddington station where Cole claimed that he was &quot;Herbert Cholmondeley&quot; of the Foreign Office and demanded a special train to Weymouth; the stationmaster arranged a VIP coach.

In Weymouth, the navy welcomed the princes with an honour guard. An Abyssinian flag was not found, so the navy proceeded to use that of Zanzibar and to play Zanzibar&#x27;s national anthem.

The group inspected the fleet. To show their appreciation, they communicated in a gibberish of words drawn from Latin and Greek; they asked for prayer mats and attempted to bestow fake military honours on some of the officers. Commander Fisher failed to recognise either of his cousins.
When the prank was uncovered in London, the ringleader Horace de Vere Cole contacted the press and sent a photo of the &quot;princes&quot; to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. The group&#x27;s pacifist views were considered a source of embarrassment, and the Royal Navy briefly became an object of ridicule. The navy later demanded that Cole be arrested. However, Cole and his compatriots had not broken any law. Instead, except for Virginia Woolf, they were subjected to a symbolic thrashing on the buttocks by junior Royal Navy officers.

==Aftermath==
According to press reports, during the visit to &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the visitors repeatedly showed amazement or appreciation by exclaiming, &quot;Bunga Bunga!&quot; In 1915 during the First World War, HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; rammed and sank a German submarine—the only battleship ever to do so. Among the telegrams of congratulation was one that read &quot;BUNGA BUNGA&quot;.

A song was heard in music halls that year, sung to the tune of &quot;The Girl I Left Behind&quot;:

Thirty years later, in 1940, Virginia Woolf gave talks about the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax to the Rodmell Women&#x27;s Institute and also to the Memoir Club, the latter attended by E. M. Forster.

<doc id="327865" wikidata="Q279728" url="?curid=327865" title="Melicoccus bijugatus">
<text>Melicoccus bijugatus is a fruit-bearing tree in the soapberry family Sapindaceae, native or naturalized across the New World tropics including South and Central America, and parts of the Caribbean. Its stone-bearing fruits, commonly called quenepa, ‘’’kenèp’’’ or guinep, are edible. Other names for the fruits include limoncillo, Bajan ackee, chenet, Spanish lime and mamoncillo.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Melicoccus&quot; was first described by Patrick Browne, an Irish physician and botanist, in 1756. This description was based on &quot;M. bijugatus&quot; trees which were cultivated in Puerto Rico. In 1760, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin described the first species in Browne&#x27;s genus, which he named &quot;M. bijugatus&quot;. In 1762 Linnaeus used a spelling variation of the name &quot;Melicocca bijuga&quot;. Over the next two centuries, Linnaeus&#x27; spelling variation was used in almost all publications. A proposal was made in 1994 to conserve &quot;Melicocca&quot; over &quot;Melicoccus&quot;, but the proposal was rejected, leading to a restoration of the original version of the name.

In 1888 German taxonomist Ludwig Radlkofer placed &quot;Melicoccus&quot; in the tribe Melicocceae together with eight other genera. In his monograph on the Neotropical members of the tribe (&quot;Talisia&quot; and &quot;Melicoccus&quot;) Pedro Acevedo-Rodríguez suggested that although &quot;Talisia&quot; and &quot;Melicoccus&quot; appeared to form a monophyletic group, the other (Old World) genera probably did not belong to the same lineage.

The specific epithet &quot;bijugatus&quot; refers to the leaves, leaves which consist of two pairs of leaflets.

==Distribution==
&quot;Melicoccus bijugatus&quot; is native to northern South America and naturalised in coastal and dry forest in Central America, the Caribbean and parts of the Old World tropics. It is believed to have been introduced into the Caribbean in pre-Columbian times and is also found in India. This fruit, known as &quot;quenepa&quot; in Puerto Rico, grows particularly abundantly in the municipality of Ponce, and there is a yearly celebration in that municipality known as Festival Nacional de la Quenepa (National Genip Fruit Festival). The fruit ripens during the warm summer months.

==Description==

Trees can reach heights of up to and come with alternate, compound leaves. The leaves have four elliptic leaflets which are long and wide. They are typically dioecious plants, though autogamous trees occur from time to time. 
Flowers have four petals and eight stamens and produce void, green drupes which are long and wide. Their pulp is orange, salmon or yellowish in color with a somewhat juicy and pasty texture.

===Fruit===

The fruit is a round drupe, approximately in diameter, with a thin, brittle, green peel. The bulk of the fruit is made up of the one (or, rarely, two) whitish seeds, which are surrounded by an edible, orange, juicy, gelatinous pulp. There are efforts in Puerto Rico and Florida to produce cultivars with a more favourable flesh-to-seed ratio.

When ripe, the fruits have a sweet-tart or lime-like flavor. The seed, being slippery, is a potential choking hazard to small children.

==Use==
The main use of the mamoncillo is its sweet fruits, which are consumed fresh or canned, and can also be used in the preparation of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. It can produce a strong yellow dye, although it is rarely used for this purpose. 

The pit is also edible. When roasted, it resembles cashew nuts. The indigenous peoples of the Orinoco river consume them as a substitute for cassava, and in Nicaragua, they are ground and made into horchata. 

The wood of the tree is pale, dense and moderately heavy with a fine grain, and is used for construction, carpentry, and fine cabinetmaking. However, it is not particularly durable, so its use is limited to indoors. The species is also commonly planted along roadsides as an ornamental tree.

== Quenepa in popular culture ==
The quenepa fruit is frequently referenced in popular culture in the Spanish Caribbean, including songs such as &quot;Suave&quot; by Puerto Rican rapper René Pérez (Residente).

<text>Deep Ellum is a neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, composed largely of arts, restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues near downtown in East Dallas. Its name is based on a corruption of the area&#x27;s principal thoroughfare, Elm Street. Older alternative uses include Deep Elm and Deep Elem.

The neighborhood lies directly east of the elevated I-45/US 75 (unsigned I-345) freeway and extends to Exposition Avenue, connected to downtown by, from north to south, Pacific, Elm, Main, Commerce, and Canton streets. The neighborhood is north of Exposition Park and south of Bryan Place.

== History ==
=== Early days ===
After earning independence as a free nation from Mexico in 1836, Texas remained autonomous for nearly a decade, when the United States officially annexed the nation in December 1845. After slavery was abolished nationwide, many freed slaves from Texas and nearby states arrived in Dallas and together congregated as a freedman&#x27;s town along the northeastern edge of town. The eventual arrival of a railroad junction in the early 1870s spurred a local economy around the shipping line industry, which led to more families settling in the future Deep Ellum, consisting of a stretch of Elm Street near the railroad junction just outside of town, and about one mile from Freedman&#x27;s Town. Together, the two areas would become one of the largest African-American communities in the South. The neighborhood traces its beginnings to the meeting point of the Houston and Texas Central railroad track, and the later Texas and Pacific line, and by 1873, the two lines were connected. The railroad junction&#x27;s historical pre-eminence can still be seen in the surrounding neighborhood, sometimes also called Central Track, the name of which is derived from the rail line. These areas and the connecting downtown segment of Elm St. across the dividing, dry Trinity River bed, together, likely retain the most distinct history in Dallas.

=== Economics development ===

When the first train came into Dallas in 1872, 500 African-Americans were already living there. Throughout the 1870s, the new railroad provided various positions and opportunities for residents nearby, which thrived as the African-American cultural and residential center since the 1870s. Even some theaters and entertainment areas were constructed for neighborhoods in the 1890s.

====Fading of Deep Ellum====

During the period of the Great Depression in the 1930s, African Americans received assistance from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which positively influenced the area. Although African-American neighborhoods pulled together during these hard times, some negative reports derailed their efforts by exposing African Americans’ terrible living conditions. These reports possibly led to higher crime rates and increased prostitution. In 1940, the government started to revise the law to update the city appearance following the national city beautification movement. At the same time, some changes in zoning and rebuilding the “slum” started from 1943 to 1945.

==== Highway&#x27;s influence towards Deep Ellum ====

In 1912, the concept of &quot;highways&quot; first entered the American consciousness. Based on support from the government of Dallas, new highways were designed at a rapid rate. In the early 1940s, the railway was torn out with strong reproach from the residents, causing problems for them. However, the highways&#x27; negative influence on those neighborhoods was not reported, and it was a significant reason for the low quality of living for black people. This successfully boosted business in Deep Ellum, but did not last too long. A new highway known as the Central Expressway was started in 1947 and completed by 1949. It departed from Elm town to downtown Dallas and decreased the African-American population. After two decades of debating between the city bureau and residents, most blocks from Deep Elm were removed by the requirement of the city&#x27;s plan. In 1968, the freeway construction commenced, and most residents were asked to move to other places. As Prior. M (2005) said, &quot;historical communities in Deep Ellum were leveled to the ground because excessive speculation during the period of rising interest rates had caused the &#x27;bubble&#x27; of the real estate boom to explode of the 1970s and the &#x27;bust&#x27; of the 1980s.&quot;

==== Later story ====

By the mid-1980s, artists, musicians, and entrepreneurs moved into the previously abandoned shops and warehouses and began to revitalize the area. Deep Ellum, with its colorful history and unique culture, experienced gentrification by the late 1990s. More affluent white citizens replaced the black community because of increasing property values, which drove many businesses out of Deep Ellum and into less expensive neighborhoods elsewhere. Meanwhile, many African-American artists tried to save Deep Ellum as a historic district, and their efforts worked, though the cultural and historical meaning of the area changed and partially disappeared over time.

=== Industrial development ===
Robert S. Munger built his first cotton-gin factory, the Continental Gin Company, in a series of brick warehouses along Elm Street and Trunk Avenue in Deep Ellum in 1888. As the business grew to become the largest manufacturer of cotton-processing equipment in the United States, Munger expanded the factory by adding additional structures along Trunk and Elm in 1912 and 1914. A Dallas Landmark District, the industrial complex was converted to loft apartments in 1997.

As Neiman Marcus and Titche-Goettinger were catering to wealthy Dallasites a mile away in downtown, Henry Ford selected Deep Ellum in 1914 as the site for one of his earliest automobile plants. Designed by architect John Graham, who planned many regional facilities for Ford during the early 1900s, the building was constructed as an assembly plant for the famous Ford Model T. The plant remained in this location at 2700 Canton Street until the mid-1930s; Adam Hats moved into the four-story brick and terracotta structure in 1959. The Dallas Landmark was converted to loft apartments in 1997, adding yet another layer of history to the building.

The Knights of Pythias Temple, also known as the Union Bankers Trust Building, is located at 2551 Elm Street. Opened in 1916, the building was designed by African-American architect William Sidney Pittman, the state&#x27;s first black architect and the son-in-law of Booker T. Washington. In addition to serving as the state headquarters for the Knights, the temple housed some of the city&#x27;s earliest offices for black doctors, dentists, and lawyers and served as the social and cultural center for the African-American community until the late 1930s. The building was Pittman&#x27;s largest built work. The building has now been turned into a hotel, becoming the first hotel in modern time to newly operate in Deep Ellum. Historically, there was the Boyd Hotel, located on Elm St. in an unsegregated stretch outside of downtown. As Conrad Hilton was building in downtown the &quot;whites only&quot; Dallas Hilton, (the first of his burgeoning empire), and the luxurious Adolphus Hotel was hosting Big Band luminaries such as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, the Boyd Hotel in Deep Ellum attracted numerous black musicians, such as Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson, who would become known as some of the early greats of the blues.

Other Dallas landmarks within Deep Ellum include The Palace Shop at 2814 Main Street (around 1913) and Parks Brothers Warehouse at 2639 Elm Street (around 1923).

=== Entertainment district ===
After decades of neglect, the 1980s and 90s marked a return for Deep Ellum as Dallas&#x27; liveliest entertainment district. At that time, it had become such a popular attraction that the streets often were blocked off to traffic, especially on weekends. It also spawned several events, such as the Deep Ellum Film Festival and Deep Ellum Arts Festival.

By 1991, Deep Ellum had 57 bars and nightclubs. Restaurants, tattoo parlors, other diverse retail shops, and increasing high-rent residential loft spaces were available. Over time, though, the streets became much emptier on weekend nights than in the 1990s. New events such as the Culture of Deep Ellum (CODE) events, and Dallas Rock Meetup Group monthly festival, involve multivenue, multiband performances that help to maintain Deep Ellum&#x27;s viability as a live-music hotspot.

Notable businesses of the 1990s and beyond include The Curtain Club (closed in 2019), Deep Ellum Live (closed in 2004), Trees (closed late 2005, reopened August 2009), 2826, Club Dada (closed and reopened 2006), The Angry Dog (a restaurant, still in business), Monica&#x27;s Aca y Alla (a restaurant, closed in 2012), Looker Hair Group (a salon), Galaxy Club (closed early 2007), the Green Room (closed September 2006, reopened 2010, closed 2011, reopened June 2013), and The Red Blood Club (closed and reopened 2007, and then closed again in 2008, and then reopened again in March 2014). Lizard Lounge stood for 28 years as a mecca of electronic music and Goth/post-punk, but closed in May 2020. Dallas Comedy House opened in 2009, closed and reopened in 2019, and closed in 2020. Dallas Comedy Club opened in 2021 in the building formerly occupied by Dallas Comedy House. The area was also host to two local breweries in the 2010s: Deep Ellum Brewing, and BrainDead Brewing (closed in 2021).

=== Crime ===

For a time, Deep Ellum struggled with a perception of a high crime rate that made people reluctant to visit the area. In mid-2006, local papers had begun to report the near-demise of the neighborhood, as a large percentage of the long-time live-music venues had closed that year, leaving mostly clubs oriented more towards recorded dance music and drinking, radically altering the &quot;vibe&quot;. In 2007, several additional small and medium clubs had closed, although new live-music venues often sprang up.

Perhaps the most known and tragic crime associated with the area that garnered nationwide attention was the murder of two children by their father. On May 2, 2001, John Battaglia murdered his daughters Faith and Liberty in his loft in Deep Ellum.

Things began turning around in 2009 and 2010, as evidenced by new bar, live-music venue, and restaurant openings. Some of the recent and planned openings include the relaunch of the near-legendary venue Trees, old favorites such as Club Dada and The Green Room, Tucker&#x27;s Blues, The Boiler Room, Anvil Pub, and La Grange (now punk-rock hotspot Three Links).

The area then was in a state of positive transition and on the upswing. In 2007, the City of Dallas encouraged large-scale residential, multifamily dwelling construction in Deep Ellum, in hopes of making it more financially successful.

In 2014 and 2015, several projects that improved infrastructure were undertaken, such as a comprehensive repaving of the street and road surfaces to add more parking and make the rough and worn sections of the pavement much better for vehicular and foot traffic. Deep Ellum continues to maintain and grow its place as a cultural and musical center for the DFW Metroplex. Despite the decline of a decade ago, visitors can now walk down Elm Street on a weekend and witness hundreds of pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles, with dozens of venues, restaurants, storefronts, and parking lots, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2017, the Deep Ellum Foundation established a public-safety program to address crime and safety concerns within the neighborhood. The addition of Dallas Police Department supervisors and officers during the area&#x27;s busiest hours has led the way in making Deep Ellum a safer place for all who work and visit in the area. 

In 2018, the foundation hired its first senior manager of public safety and security, Phillip Honoré, who collaborated with business owners, residents, and city leaders to improve overall public safety in the popular entertainment and arts district. The Deep Ellum Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation that exists to enhance, improve, and market the neighborhood of Deep Ellum as a whole through public safety, marketing and promotion, business development and recruitment, and general improvement efforts for the area. Reviews on the foundation&#x27;s progress are mixed.

In 2018, scooter companies flooded Deep Ellum with scooters and the city was not prepared to regulate them, leading to a public-safety issue due to people riding them on the crowded sidewalk. Motorized scooters are no longer allowed to be ridden in the neighborhood on the sidewalks.

In 2019, crime in Deep Ellum had a slight increase in minor crimes after years of improvement. Until the summer of that year, several crimes in the area were reported and prosecuted.

In May 2020, several businesses in Deep Ellum were vandalized and looted following a protest in downtown Dallas. A peaceful protest following the murder of George Floyd turned violent when a small group clashed with police, broke out windows, looted businesses, and set fires.

== Music ==
=== Jazz and blues ===
Deep Ellum&#x27;s claim to fame has been its music. In the 1920s and 30s, the neighborhood had become a hotbed for early jazz and blues musicians, hosting the likes of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, Robert Johnson (who recorded 27 tracks with Don Law in a nearby Vitagraph recording studio in downtown Dallas), Huddie &quot;Lead Belly&quot; Ledbetter, the young T-Bone Walker, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Whistlin&#x27; Alex Moore, and Bessie Smith. These and other musicians performed on the streets and in Deep Ellum clubs such as The Harlem and The Palace. From 1920 to 1950, the number of nightclubs, cafes, and domino parlors in Deep Ellum jumped from 12 to 20.

In 1937, a columnist described Deep Ellum as:

At the time, you could find gun and locksmith shops, clothing stores, the Cotton Club, tattoo studios, barber-shops, pawn shops, drugstores, tea rooms, loan offices, domino halls, pool halls, and walk-up hotels. On its sidewalks you could find pigeon droppers, reefer men, craps shooters, card sharps, and sellers of cocaine and marijuana. Sometime around World War I, Lead Belly and Blind Lemon Jefferson got together and began composing folk tunes, with Dallas often in the lyrics. In a song called &quot;Take A Whiff on Me&quot;:

The most famous song about the district was recorded in 1933 under the title of &quot;Deep Elm Blues&quot; by the Lone Star Cowboys. The song and the lyrics were derived from the Georgia Crackers’ 1927 recording, &quot;The Georgia Black Bottom&quot;. The Shelton Brothers recorded &quot;Deep Elem Blues&quot; on Decca in 1935. Despite these earlier recordings, they claimed credit for the song. The lyrics narrate white men seeking immoral and illegal entertainment in an African-American part of town. The Shelton Brothers iterated the name of the district in &quot;Deep Elem Blues, No. 2&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Deep Elem&quot;, and &quot;Deep Elm Boogie Woogie Blues&quot;. Dick Stabile and his Orchestra, the Texas Wanderers, and the Wilburn Brothers all invoked the district&#x27;s name in separate Decca pressings.

&quot;Deep Ellum Blues&quot; was later performed by the Grateful Dead:

Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Rough and Rowdy Ways&quot; (release June 19, 2020) has the song &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot; with the line &quot;... / When you&#x27;re down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe /...&quot; (© &amp; P Columbia Records)
Following World War II, the success of old Deep Ellum started to fade. The ever-growing availability and use of the automobile led to the removal of the Houston and Texas Central railroad tracks—to make way for Central Expressway—and by 1956 the streetcar line had been removed. Businesses closed, residents moved to the suburbs and the music all but stopped. In 1969, a new elevation of Central Expressway truncated Deep Ellum, completely obliterating the 2400 block of Elm Street, viewed by many as the center of the neighborhood. By the 1970s, few original businesses remained.

===1983–1999: The New &quot;Glory Days&quot; of Deep Ellum===
In 1983, the Near East Side Area Planning Study, or &quot;Deep Ellum Plan&quot;, was commissioned, as the city sought to &quot;downzone&quot; Deep Ellum, meaning that building height, population, and street width were to be carefully monitored so as to help the neighborhood maintain an artistic, historic atmosphere. Visual artists, musicians, and entrepreneurs began to move into the area, opening up new galleries and venues, attracting young creatives. Though dormant for years, a new can-do spirit was re-awakening in downtown. Over the course of the 1980s, the Dallas tourism bureau formally promoted the West End Historic District (Dallas) as a destination for business and political class conventioneers, including those attending the 1984 Republican National Convention. Meanwhile, the Dallas Gay scene and the debauchery of well-monied Dallasites and visiting celebrities and hangers-on partying in downtown discotheques became the stuff of legends, as venues such as The Old Plantation and The Starck Club (financed by Philippe Starck and Stevie Nicks) flourished. For its part, Deep Ellum on the east side of downtown near Fair Park became known as an organic, DIY breeding ground for the Dallas Art, Roots (Americana), and Punk Scenes.

With the insurgence of new nightclubs and venues, Deep Ellum began to explode as a music spot, featuring local stalwarts such as The Reverend Horton Heat, Shallow Reign, Three on a Hill, and Loco Gringos, and underground regional acts such as The Flaming Lips from Oklahoma City, Butthole Surfers from San Antonio, Meat Puppets from Arizona, and True Believers (band) from Austin. Influential music venues included Twilight Room, Adair&#x27;s Saloon, Prophet Bar, Theatre Gallery, Club Clearview, Club Dada, and 500x Cafe. Young artists such as Rhett Miller, Sara Hickman, and The Dixie Chicks frequently busked for tips on the streets and in small shops. Local radio stations began playing demo tapes and broadcasting the live performances of &quot;Deep Ellum Bands.&quot; Alternative media and music weeklies such as The Dallas Observer and Buddy Magazine devoted regular columns to covering the scene.However, throughout the mid &#x27;80s, the neighborhood still faced serious safety issues, including all the usual vices (sex during the onslaught of AIDS, drugs, underage drinking) and the presence of skinheads, but as Deep Ellum continued to expand, the threats dwindled. By 1991, over 50 nightclubs and bars had opened in Deep Ellum.

By the 1990s, musical acts including Toadies, Erykah Badu, Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians, Tripping Daisy, and Old 97&#x27;s began to gain prominence as not only local successes, but national stars. Older stalwarts like Ronnie Dawson (musician) and Ray Wylie Hubbard found a new audience in venues such as Deep Ellum&#x27;s Sons of Hermann Hall. Once Deep Ellum had gained traction as the heart of music in Dallas, popular touring artists such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, The Roots, The Notorious B.I.G., and Fugazi would book shows at venues including Trees Dallas and The Bomb Factory.

Although Deep Ellum&#x27;s popularity and vitality continues to wax and wane through the years, its relevance as a music hub for Dallas and the region persists.

== Street art ==

In addition to live music, Deep Ellum was a hotbed for the emerging genre of street art. Many of the music venues used graffiti artists to advertise music shows.

In 1991, the city commissioned local artists to create murals along the Good-Latimer Expressway tunnel (a major entry to the neighborhood) in a project organized by artist Frank Campagna, which he named TunnelVisions. The tunnel was demolished in the spring of 2007 to make way for the DART Green Line train. In 2009, Campagna led artists in the completion of a mural project along the redesigned Good-Latimer gateway, and subsequently, additional mural projects in the adjacent art park under the I-30 overpass at Good Latimer between Commerce and Canton streets. The wide variety of images, largely in a &#x27;graffiti&#x27; style, have long been a popular tourist attraction.

While street art is popular in Deep Ellum, a large portion of the murals in the area are commissioned by local businesses. Some of the most recognizable murals were created by Frank Campagna, owner of Kettle Art Gallery, and alternately known as the Godfather of Dallas Street Art, for legendary music venues such as Gypsy Tea Room and Trees. Most recently, the 42 mural project invited a select number of artists to paint murals throughout Deep Ellum, in hopes of passing along the history and heritage of the area. In 2021, a 8,500 square foot mural was completed for The Stack office building, becoming one of the largest Deep Ellum murals ever painted.

<doc id="327871" wikidata="Q7729195" url="?curid=327871" title="The Day Today">
<text>The Day Today is a British comedy television show that parodies television news and current affairs programmes, broadcast from 19 January to 23 February 1994 on BBC2. It was created by Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris and is an adaptation of the radio programme &quot;On the Hour&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 9 August 1991 and 28 May 1992 and was also written by Morris, Iannucci, Steven Wells, Andrew Glover, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring, David Quantick, and the cast. For &quot;The Day Today&quot;, Peter Baynham joined the writing team, and Lee and Herring were replaced by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews. The principal cast of &quot;On the Hour&quot; was retained for &quot;The Day Today&quot;.

&quot;The Day Today&quot; is composed of six half-hour episodes and a selection of shorter five-minute slots recorded as promotional trailers for the longer episodes. The series won many awards including Morris winning the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer. All six episodes are available on BBC DVD, having previously been issued on VHS.

==Format==
Each episode is presented as a mock news programme, and the episodes rely on a combination of ludicrous fictitious news stories, covered with a serious, quasi-professional attitude. Each episode revolves around one or two major stories, which are pursued throughout the programme, along with a host of other stories usually only briefly referred to. In addition, the programme dips into other channels from time to time, presents clips of fictitious upcoming BBC programmes, and conducts street interviews with members of the public, in a segment titled &quot;Speak Your Brains&quot;.

The programme frequently comments on other programmes, most often a spoof soap opera called &quot;The Bureau&quot;, set in a 24-hour bureau de change, incorporating clichéd soap opera-style plots, which apparently produces and airs 2,000 episodes between the first and third episodes of &quot;The Day Today&quot; and becomes a hit in Italy. The programme also contains clips from a spoof documentary series called &quot;The Pool&quot;, featuring a public swimming pool and its neurotic staff, Morris&#x27; character explaining that &quot;The Day Today&quot; has funded a documentary on every public building in the country. The final episode features reports from the fictitious documentary &quot;The Office&quot;, which follows office workers as they go on a retreat with an efficiency expert. Other non-news segments of the programme include the occasional &quot;physical cartoons&quot; of current events set in the studio. Morris frequently parodies entirely separate channels, including RokTV (spoofing MTV); reporting on the fictitious and psychotically violent African-American rapper Fur-Q; and &quot;Genutainment&quot;, a segment which reports on a sheepdog averting a helicopter disaster in a parody of the real-life rescue show &quot;999&quot;.

The programme occasionally features producer Armando Iannucci and writer Peter Baynham, the latter playing Gay Desk reporter Colin Poppshed, among other characters. John Thomson, Graham Linehan, Tony Haase and Minnie Driver also appear. Michael Alexander St John provides the voiceover stings, as he did in &quot;On the Hour&quot;.

Much of the programme&#x27;s humour derives from its bombastic style of reporting and its unnecessarily elaborate graphics. The theme tune is deliberately overdramatic and self-important, and the opening sequence of each episode is lengthy and complex, a parody of the overuse of computer-generated credit sequences on news programmes (as the graphics throughout were developed and designed by ITN). One episode presents false adverts featuring depictions of &quot;The Day Today&quot; being broadcast in bizarre locations: the night sky over Paris, the sides of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, the &quot;International Hackenbacker Building&quot; in Chicago, and the handles of 400 million petrol pumps across the globe; this is a parody of CNN International&#x27;s promotions advertising the hotels in which the channel could be seen. Morris presents aggressively, often arguing with reporters and insulting guests on-air, and at one stage provoking a war between Australia and Hong Kong.

The programme frequently lambasts Conservative government politicians in office at the time of the programme&#x27;s production. Those repeatedly lampooned by the series include John Major, Michael Heseltine (who had his picture swapped with an old Bosnian woman), Chris Patten, Douglas Hurd, Virginia Bottomley, and Michael Portillo, in addition to US President Bill Clinton. Labour politician Paul Boateng also appears briefly in an interview about the fictitious musician &#x27;Herman the Tosser&#x27;.

Each episode is brought to an interrupted ending with just enough time to quickly overview the following day&#x27;s newspapers (a parody of Jeremy Paxman on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;) printed with absurd headlines such as &quot;Lord Mayor&#x27;s pirouette in fire chief wife decapitation&quot; or &quot;Russia elects cobweb&quot; and a final humorously misused video. Each episode ends in a familiar style for news reports, with the camera panning out as the studio lights dim on Morris. Instead of shuffling his papers in clichéd newsreader style, Morris takes advantage of the dimming lights to perform bizarre activities; putting many pens in his jacket pockets, placing a tourniquet around his arm in preparation to inject heroin, removing his normal hair to reveal long blonde locks underneath, and, in the last episode, prostrating himself before the newsdesk.

In addition to the character Alan Partridge and many of the cast and writers, there are other crossovers between the fictional worlds of &quot;On the Hour&quot;, &quot;The Day Today&quot; and the radio and television series of &quot;Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;. With the exception of Patrick Marber, the entire main cast of &quot;The Day Today&quot; take guest roles in &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, in addition to writers Peter Baynham, Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan. Marber is, however seen in a photograph on the wall of Peartree Productions.

==Notable coverage==
The programme features surreal news items. Examples include:
* Reports that explosive-packed terrorist dogs were being released in London by the IRA. These &quot;bomb dogs&quot; wreak havoc, and prompt the British police to begin executing any dog on sight. This story is accompanied by a clip of Steve Coogan impersonating a Gerry Adams-esque Sinn Féin leader, spouting rhetoric while inhaling helium to subtract credibility from his statement. This was a satirical comment on broadcasters&#x27; responses to the law at the time, which prevented any Sinn Féin spokesperson from being heard in radio and television; their words would instead be dubbed by an actor speaking in a neutral tone of voice.
* Coverage of a feud between John Major and the Queen. The feud culminates in physical fighting between the two in Buckingham Palace, videoed by a secret reporter who comments on &quot;loud swearing voices&quot;, &quot;the sounds of bodies falling against furniture&quot;, and the &quot;Prime Minister leaving with bleeding legs&quot;. Early coverage of the incident worsens the situation, and prompts Morris&#x27; character to air a propaganda reel reserved for national emergencies; film consisting of a sequence of subtly humorous scenarios (stockbrokers spend &quot;playtime&quot; outside the London Stock Exchange jumping and skipping; a paramedic comforting an injured old woman gives her a brief kiss on the cheek; a man with a cigarette gets the offer of a light from a group of six-year-olds), all set against a backdrop of patriotic British music (&quot;Thaxted&quot; by Gustav Holst), in an effort to boost British national solidarity. The feud ultimately ends with the Queen and her entourage marching on Downing Street to beat up John Major, and after the close of the incident, the Royal Mail issues a commemorative stamp featuring the Queen and John Major kissing.
* Coverage of an ongoing rail crisis, following a train trapped on the tracks in Hampshire. Trapped by a jammed semaphore signal, the stranded train rapidly becomes the scene of anarchy and paganism, its passengers reverting to an animalistic state.
* In the fifth episode, Morris provokes a war between Australia and Hong Kong as much of the episode revolves around bombastically over-the-top reports on the resulting conflict in a parody of the extensive and overdramatic media coverage of the Gulf War. Subsequent reports of the war delivered from &quot;Eastmanstown in the Upper Cataracts, on the Australio-Hong-Kong border&quot;, are humorously blown out of proportion. At the end of the episode, a false advertisement features a three-tape VHS set of the war produced by &quot;The Day Today&quot;, featuring footage of the war and its origins, set against a backdrop of inappropriate pop music, a parody of tabloid television&#x27;s tendency to &quot;dumb down&quot; stories and present serious events in a lighthearted manner.

Other stories included a report of two French boys who break into the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s computer databanks in order to change the Catholic catechism; an urgent report that the British pound had been stolen; reports of wild horses disrupting the London Underground; and reports that Crete had been kidnapped by Libya and that Japan had manufactured 16 identical Japans.

==Main characters==
* Christopher Morris (Chris Morris) – the newsreader. Morris has several computers giving him the news instantly from around the world, and often interrupts segments in order to break in with more important stories. He is confrontational and aggressive, even provoking a war between Australia and Hong Kong. The character was described by the British Film Institute as &quot;a gleeful, bloodlust hybrid of Jeremy Paxman and Michael Buerk&quot;. In &quot;The Day Today&quot;, Morris reprises his overzealous newsreader role from &quot;On the Hour&quot;.
* Collaterlie Sisters (alternative spelling: &quot;Collately Sisters&quot;) (Doon Mackichan) – business correspondent. As satire of the incomprehensible nature of business news to the layperson, Sisters talks nonsensically about the world of business, padding out her reports with meaningless jargon (&quot;Trading remained succulent for the rest of the day.&quot;) She uses bewildering graphics, mainly when addressing the currency market, using such aids as the &quot;Currency Cat&quot;, the &quot;Currency Kidney&quot;, and the &quot;International Finance Arse&quot;. Sisters also employs odd syntaxes, reciting strangely arranged sentences in a semi-robotic deadpan fashion (often smirking at arbitrary points in the monologue) and frequently name-checking Chris in the middle of her reports. During her reports, a news ticker scrolls across the bottom, displaying meaningless symbols. Morris can sometimes be heard making scathing remarks about her. In one episode, he asks for Sisters to be taken off his monitor as &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see her face&quot;.
* Sylvester Stuart (David Schneider) – the weatherman. Only Stuart&#x27;s head is seen, usually floating on a graphic background. He describes the weather with elliptical analogies such as &quot;That&#x27;s about as warm as going into a heated drawing room after chopping some wood&quot; and describing gloomy weather as &quot;a bit like waking up next to a corpse.&quot; His reports have included the &quot;Metball&quot;, a pinball-style graphic of the British Isles with Stuart&#x27;s face as the ball, and another featuring the &quot;Weather Collar&quot;, a large collar with the British Isles painted on it, rotating his head to face different areas of the country.
* Barbara Wintergreen (Rebecca Front) – correspondent on &quot;The Day Today&quot;″s American sister channel CBN. Speaking with an exaggerated American accent, Wintergreen reports on the multiple executions of mass murderer Chapman Baxter (Patrick Marber) by a variety of bizarre methods, and on US couples having a prosthetic pregnancy. All her reports make use of convoluted puns and interviews with stereotypical stock characters in American culture (including Steve Coogan as dimwitted Southerner Alvin Holler). Wintergreen&#x27;s reports end with a joke and pouting at the camera. The CBN reports are presented in a different format to other reports shown in the episodes; her segments are made using different shooting and editing techniques which mimic the appearance of American news, while the content of her reports satirises common British perceptions of the American media. The segments went through excessive processing to accentuate the reduction in picture quality typical of standards conversion of the time. The character of Barbara Wintergreen originated in &quot;On the Hour&quot;, which also featured a character identical to Chapman Baxter, played by Marber and named &quot;Daimler Jeffries&quot;.
* Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan (Patrick Marber) – economic correspondent. O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan is extremely incompetent, and his reports end with him having to admit their fundamental inaccuracy to an unforgiving Morris. Examples include a claim that an American factory with only 25,000 workers had made 35,000 redundant; a failed effort to conduct a light-hearted interview with a shipping minister; and a report in which O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan claims to have conducted an interview with an elusive economics minister in the German language, his ignorance of which is then exposed. O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan resembles former BBC newsreader Richard Whitmore; his name is inspired by that of Brian Hanrahan. The character originated from writing by Stewart Lee and Richard Herring, in the second series of &quot;On the Hour&quot;.
* Rosy May (Rebecca Front) – environmental correspondent. The bearded Rosy May presents the &quot;Enviromation&quot; slot. Her stories include the sky detaching from the horizon; a mobile cemetery; a ban on wave hunting; and a refrigerator powered by earthworms. Her segments end with a new-age style epigram, such as &quot;Tread not on the forest leaves, for you tread on my face&quot;. May never interacts with other members of the news team. The character originated in &quot;On the Hour&quot;, although in that series, her segment is titled &quot;Green Desk&quot;. (The CD releases of &quot;On the Hour&quot; spell the character&#x27;s name as &quot;Rosie May&quot;, but the &quot;Enviromation&quot; ident in &quot;The Day Today&quot; identifies her as &quot;Rosy May&quot;.)
* Jaques-&#x27;Jaques&#x27; Liverot (Patrick Marber) – resident French commentator. Depicted as a stereotypical postmodernist philosopher, eternally smoking alone in a dark and gloomy corner of the studio, Liverot comments on the news throughout the programme, using a series of pseudo-existentialist &quot;bons mots&quot;. He asks rhetorical questions, such as &quot;If we could see politics, what would it look like?&quot; and makes philosophical statements, such as &quot;An old man stands naked in front of a mirror, eating soup. He is a fool.&quot;
* Valerie Sinatra (Rebecca Front) – travel correspondent. Sinatra works in &quot;The Day Today&quot; travel pod, perched at the top of a tower a mile above the centre of Great Britain. The traffic reports cover accidents such as a piece of pie blocking the road and coverage of an ongoing crash that has been in progress south of Newcastle upon Tyne for several weeks; police marksmen to shoot speeding drivers in the chin; as well as general traffic reports including a claim that workers have finished cobbling the M25 and that cars are being slowed down by their own lights. Morris flirts with her at the start and end of her reports.
* Brant (David Schneider) – the physical cartoonist from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Brant satirises the news using cartoon backgrounds and then acting as the main character in the cartoon itself. His cartoons rely on elaborate physical metaphors which have to be labelled to render them comprehensible; an example is his cartoon of Britain&#x27;s handover of Hong Kong, where Chris Patten, &quot;making a monkey of himself&quot;, is represented as King (Hong) Kong climbing the British Empire State Building, swatting at aeroplanes representing China and the handover year of 1997. Each cartoon ends with his signature. The visual style is reminiscent of Nicholas Garland, a real &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; political cartoonist, and the cumbersome labelling of political cartoons generally.
* Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) – sports correspondent. Partridge is an old-school lower-middle-class Conservative who has little knowledge of the sports he is covering, and frequently makes critical errors on-air which reveal this. However, unlike the similarly incompetent Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan, he is adept enough at improvisation to often mask his ignorance of the subject at hand. Morris makes a point of making Partridge appear uncomfortable on-air: in one episode, his sports reports are interrupted three times by Morris; in another, Morris openly humiliates Partridge on-air; and in the final episode, Morris atypically compliments Partridge on his report, and goes so far as to kiss him on the mouth. The character had previously appeared, portrayed by Coogan, in the Radio 4 shows &quot;On the Hour&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot; and would go on to star in the TV series &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; and the movie &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot;.
* Ted Maul (Chris Morris) – the roving reporter who later appears in &quot;Brass Eye&quot; made his first appearance in &quot;The Day Today&quot; as a grey-haired, moustachioed veteran, with a very enthusiastically aggressive style of reporting. His reports include one on cannibalism in the police force, and a long-running report covering commuters trapped on a train, who turn to paganism and violence during their wait on the line.

One-off correspondents in the series have absurd names, and include Hellwyn Ballard (Armando Iannucci), Iggy Pop Barker (Marber), Romella Belx (Front), Dônnnald Bethl&#x27;hem (Marber), Eugene Fraxby (Morris), Suzanna Gekkaloys (Mackichan), Pheeona Haahlahm (Mackichan), Collin Haye (Morris), Remedy Malahide (Front), Spartacus Mills (Coogan), Colin Poppshed (Peter Baynham), Beverley Smax (Mackichan) and Suki Bapswent (Morris in drag, as part of the &quot;RokTV&quot; spoof which also features Harfynn Teuport, with Morris putting on a generic Dutch accent). David Schneider also plays &quot;The Day Today&quot;″s News Dancer, who performs an energetic interpretive dance routine as an accompaniment to some news stories.

==Reception==
&quot;The Day Today&quot; was described as &quot;achingly funny&quot; by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;the freshest and funniest comedy since Monty Python&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s review was mixed, calling it &quot;not exactly hilarious&quot;.

==DVD bonus material==
The DVD features extensive bonus material including short mini-episodes featuring original material which were broadcast the night before the original broadcast of each episode, the original pilot episode, and an Open University programme about news presentation which includes an analysis of how and why parodies such as &quot;The Day Today&quot; work.

The DVD also includes several &quot;easter eggs&quot; including: a version of a State of the Union Address by George W. Bush, edited to make United States policy seem insanely belligerent; a new audio discussion between Morris and Alan Partridge discussing bizarre theories of how Diana, Princess of Wales, and John F. Kennedy died; a further discussion between Morris and Partridge about the environment; a reunion of Morris, Partridge, Brant, Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan, Collaterlie Sisters and Valerie Sinatra; and another audio sketch featuring Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan pretending to file a report from the World Trade Center covering up the fact that he had overslept, while blithely unaware about the attacks on 11 September 2001 have just taken place. Pressing the Angle button during the third episode unveils brief, intermittent visual descriptions of the episode by Andy Hodgson and Jennifer Reinfrank, whilst a half-hour interview with Steve Coogan, conducted by Mark Radcliffe on 17 January 1994 edition of his radio show, can be accessed through the extended scenes menu.

<text>On the Hour was a British radio programme that parodied current affairs broadcasting, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1991 and 1992. Written by Chris Morris, Armando Iannucci, Steven Wells, Andrew Glover, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and David Quantick, &quot;On the Hour&quot; starred Morris as the overzealous and self-important principal anchor (for which he used his own full name). He was accompanied by a regular cast assembled by Iannucci, comprising Steve Coogan, Rebecca Front, Doon Mackichan, Patrick Marber and David Schneider, who portrayed assorted news reporters, presenters and interviewees. &quot;On the Hour&quot; featured the first appearance of Coogan&#x27;s character Alan Partridge as the &quot;Sports Desk&quot; reporter.

==Overview==

As in much of Morris&#x27;s work, surrealism was an important part of the programme, the nonsense in the content (&quot;De-frocked cleric eats car park&quot;, &quot;Borrowed dog finds Scotland&quot;, etc.) delivered in the same straight-faced manner with which contemporary news stories are dealt, and it has often been quoted that Morris&#x27;s initial intention was indeed to show how the public would believe anything if it were delivered with a straight face. It did fool many people, with some listeners ringing in to complain about how the anchor treated his guests. The programme also utilised editing of out-of-context sound-clips and prank phone calls, heightening its surreal quality.

The programme satirised broadcasting within news programmes by emphasising that it was reporting the news, repeating the show&#x27;s title, and using such aspects as news speak, media manipulation, exploitation of tragedies, patronising mistreatment of the general public, a lack of fact checking (personified by Marber&#x27;s Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan), and the general assumption that the programme itself is infallible (&quot;&quot;On the Hour&quot; – Towards a New Eden&quot;). Also satirised were party political broadcasts, chummy yet vacuous radio DJs (in the form of Morris&#x27;s Wayne Carr), religious broadcasting, glossy magazines, &#x27;fun&#x27; local events, local radio, youth information shows, Radio 4 plays, royal ceremonies, and even satirical comedies that do not hit the mark. Episodes often featured a main storyline (the World &quot;Summit on the Future&quot;, coverage of the public execution of Prince Edward, etc.) interspersed between the news items.

Twelve episodes were made (including a Christmas special, of which two versions exist) and broadcast in 1991 and 1992. A regular feature in Series One (episodes 1-6) was the &quot;On the Hour&quot; &quot;Audio Pullout&quot;, a mid-episode &quot;colour supplement&quot; that would usually parody human interest stories and local events (and, in one episode, was sponsored by a [fictional] American Christian Fundamentalist sect).

The final episode of &quot;On the Hour&quot; closed with Morris introducing a set of headlines with the line &quot;And there is still just time to part the beef curtains on tomorrow&#x27;s news.&quot; Running throughout the final episode was the announcement that &quot;On the Hour&quot; would be taking over all of Radio 4 to transmit 24-hour &quot;Perma-News&quot;.

&quot;On the Hour&quot; was named &quot;Best Radio Comedy&quot; at the 1992 British Comedy Awards, and it also won the 1992 Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain Award for Comedy/Light Entertainment. The &quot;On the Hour&quot; team (minus Lee and Herring due to creative/legal disputes, who were replaced by Peter Baynham and writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews) subsequently made a television series called &quot;The Day Today&quot;, which retained the same regular cast and several characters from &quot;On the Hour.&quot;

==Recurring characters==

Christopher Morris (Chris Morris): The anchor. Combative and over-zealous, he believes in the infallibility of the news, bombastically delivering slogans like &quot;Man is only 90% water, but &quot;On the Hour&quot; is 100% news!&quot;, &quot;Arise, Sir News!&quot; and &quot;These facts are ear-shaped, let&#x27;s ram them home!&quot; Morris frequently talks over his guests and does not realise or will not admit when he has the wrong person on the other end of the phone. He &quot;interviews&quot; real-life politicians, whose responses are edited from pre-recorded material to render them nonsensical, as well as the public, who give baffled or earnest responses to absurd questions such as, &quot;Which is worse, a horizontal disease or a vertical disease?&quot; Morris reprised his newsman persona for &quot;The Day Today&quot; and &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, retaining the character&#x27;s self-importance while further emphasising his bullying demeanour.

Roger Blatt/Michael Blatt (Chris Morris): Roger Blatt is the &quot;Disaster correspondent&quot; for a train crash report; the identically-voiced Michael Blatt is the &quot;Strategy correspondent&quot; for the &quot;On the Hour&quot; &quot;War Special&quot;.

Wayne Carr (Chris Morris): An upbeat and smug DJ with a penchant for contracting words. Wayne&#x27;s reports include inappropriately upbeat coverage of a train crash disaster, an exposé on hidden messages in pop records, and a &quot;chinnywag&quot; about endangered animals. The character of Wayne Carr was retained from Morris&#x27;s previous radio projects. His name is a reference to the abusive term &quot;wanker&quot;. While the personality of Carr is an amalgam of various BBC Radio 1 DJs throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the principal inspiration is based on Steve Wright (DJ) and his show Steve Wright in the Afternoon.

Continuity Announcer (Chris Morris): Often called upon to present news or announce the station&#x27;s scheduling, the Continuity Announcer speaks with a deep, nasal voice, and can be heard shuffling paperwork before he speaks. Morris later used the Continuity Announcer&#x27;s voice for the national emergencies propaganda reel in the second episode of &quot;The Day Today&quot;.

Lionel Cosgrave (David Schneider): An Everyman who appears in several news reports; his surname is referred to interchangeably as &quot;Cosgrave&quot; and &quot;Cosgrove&quot;. Lionel&#x27;s age varies according to each report – sometimes he is a youngster, at other times middle-aged. Lionel is usually presented as a victim (of police corruption and brutality; physical abuse in public schools, etc.).

Rosy May (Rebecca Front): Environmental correspondent. Rosy presents absurd environmentally themed news in the segment &quot;Green Desk&quot;. This segment is accompanied by new-age music, including synthesised whale song. Rosy later appeared in &quot;The Day Today&quot;, although her segment was re-titled &quot;Enviromation&quot;.

Jacques Œuf (Chris Morris): Appears in two episodes as a French counterpart to Wayne Carr, primarily reporting on celebrity incidents, including a series of photos featuring celebrities vomiting in public and a fight between Brigitte Bardot and Jean-Michel Jarre at Cannes. A broadcaster from &quot;Euronews&quot;, Œuf speaks in improper and mispronounced French. Like Carr, his name is a homophonic slang term for masturbation (&quot;jack off&quot;).

Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan (Patrick Marber): A grossly incompetent Economics correspondent who reports dubious facts and figures before being forced by Morris to admit that he has not read the reports he is presenting. He later appeared in &quot;The Day Today&quot;.

Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan): Sports correspondent. Alan presents &quot;Sports Desk&quot; reports for &quot;On the Hour&quot;, but he frequently displays little to no knowledge of the sports he is covering, getting the terminology and basic rules of the sports wrong. Interviewing real-life sporting figures impersonated by the cast such as Nigel Mansell, Graham Gooch, Seve Ballesteros, Gabriela Sabatini and Linford Christie, as well as fictional athletes, Alan frequently goes into tangents relating to groin injuries and the interviewees&#x27; physical attractiveness. His interviews usually end in awkwardness for himself, his subject(s), or both. He also makes condescending remarks towards women and Moroccans during his coverage of the 1992 Olympic Games. He is absent from the original untransmitted pilot episode of &quot;On the Hour&quot;, which features a sports correspondent named &quot;Bill&quot;, played by Armando Iannucci. Now one of Britain&#x27;s most enduring and beloved comic characters, after &quot;On the Hour&quot;, Alan would appear in the Radio 4 series &quot;Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;; the TV series &quot;The Day Today&quot;, &quot;Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;; the web series &quot;Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge&quot;; two &#x27;specials&#x27;, the film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; and most recently, the spoof magazine show &quot;This Time With Alan Partridge&quot;; as well as several appearances for the UK charity Comic Relief.

Kevin Smear (Patrick Marber): Correspondent who appears in several episodes and is later referred to as the winner of the &quot;Golden Fist Award&quot; for his reporting.

Monsignor Treeb-Lopez (Patrick Marber): Contributes trite, religious &quot;bons mot&quot; all somehow referencing Jesus in the segment &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;. A creation of Lee and Herring, Treeb-Lopez was not retained for &quot;The Day Today&quot;; his character was replaced by Marber&#x27;s French postmodernist philosopher, Jaques-&#x27;Jaques&#x27; Liverot.

Barbara Wintergreen (Rebecca Front): Correspondent on the American channel CBN. Speaking with an exaggerated American accent and making use of convoluted puns, her reports include a Christmas-themed prison execution, prenatal makeovers, a re-enactment of the JFK assassination, and women being banned from the state of Nebraska. Barbara&#x27;s reports include recurring characters such as Death row inmate Daimler Jeffries (Patrick Marber) and feminist Donna Doubtfire (Doon Mackichan), as well as various characters played by Steve Coogan. Barbara Wintergreen later appeared in &quot;The Day Today&quot;, in which Marber&#x27;s Daimler Jeffries character was renamed &quot;Chapman Baxter&quot; and Mackichan&#x27;s Donna Doubtfire character was renamed &quot;Thea Peachman&quot;.

== Reception ==
In a 2008 article for &quot;Uncut&quot;, David Quantick described &quot;On the Hour&quot; as &quot;the show that changed everything&quot; and wrote &quot;only a complete arse would call &quot;On The Hour&quot; the &quot;Monty Python&quot; of the modern era, but I am a complete arse, so here goes: &quot;On The Hour&quot; is the &quot;Monty Python&quot; of the modern era. Which makes me at best a lumberjack, but there you go.&quot; In 2009, &quot;The Quietus&quot; wrote that &quot;On the Hour&quot; &quot;remains one of British broadcast comedy&#x27;s most dizzying accomplishments.&quot;

==Commercial availability==

Owing to the dispute with Lee and Herring mentioned above, the show was initially only commercially available as a two-hour audio compilation on audio cassette. The compilation was edited down from the six hours of both series and specials, which removed all traces of Lee and Herring&#x27;s writing. This was widely available for many years, and a CD re-release was announced in the early 2000s in the inlays of other Radio Collection titles but failed to materialise.

Like many BBC Radio comedies, &quot;On the Hour&quot; has been repeated on the digital station BBC Radio 4 Extra since its inception in 2002 as BBC7 (later BBC Radio 7), although most of these differ from the original broadcast versions. The final two episodes from series 1 are aired in their 30-minute form, taken from extended repeats broadcast in 1991, whilst series 2 transmissions are based on the edited repeats for BBC Radio 4. The penultimate episode of series 2 was missing from all millennial repeats, as the master tape was apparently lost, but after a twelve-year search the tape was finally located and the episode repeated several times in 2015 (from the master copy of the edited repeat like the rest of series 2).

Both series of &quot;On the Hour&quot; were released as limited-edition audio CD boxed sets by Warp Records in November 2008, in their original episodic form. Series 1 was uncut, although five out of six episodes of series 2 were presented in their significantly edited repeat versions. The only uncut series 2 episode — the then-still-missing episode 5 - was included from an off-air cassette. The Christmas episode included on the series 1 set is the 1992 version. The original version, first broadcast on 24 December 1991, featured a satirical overview of the year 1991; this overview was replaced by material parodying the events of 1992 for the episode&#x27;s repeat on 31 December 1992.

Extra tracks include the untransmitted pilot episode; a remastered needledrop of the flexidisc originally released by &quot;Select&quot; magazine in May 1992; the &quot;Resurrection Cattle&quot; sketch (intended to be slipped into the Radio 4 series &quot;Today&quot;); and over 20 minutes of unedited improvisations from some of the Alan Partridge sessions.

Both series can also be purchased on iTunes and have been uploaded to streaming sites such as YouTube.
