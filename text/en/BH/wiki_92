<text>Charles Leonard Gehringer (May 11, 1903 – January 21, 1993), nicknamed &quot;the Mechanical Man&quot;, was an American professional baseball second baseman. He played for the Detroit Tigers for 19 seasons from 1924 to 1942. He compiled a .320 career batting average with 2,839 hits and 1,427 runs batted in (RBIs). He had seven seasons with more than 200 hits and was the starting second baseman and played every inning of the first six All Star Games. He won the American League batting title in 1937 with a .371 average and won the American League Most Valuable Player Award. He helped lead the Tigers to three American League pennants (1934, 1935, and 1940) and the 1935 World Series championship.

Gehringer was also one of the best fielding second basemen in history. At the time of his retirement, he ranked first in Major League Baseball (MLB) history with 1,444 double plays turned at second base (now seventh in MLB history). He remains among MLB&#x27;s all-time leaders with 7,068 assists at second base (second in MLB history) and 5,369 putouts (sixth in MLB history).

Gehringer later served as the Tigers general manager during the 1952 and 1953 seasons. After his playing career ended, he operated a company serving as an agent for manufacturers of automobile interior furnishings. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949 and had his jersey (No. 2) retired by the Tigers in 1983.

==Early years==
Gehringer was born on May 11, 1903, on a farm in Iosco Township, southwest of Fowlerville, Michigan. He was the second son of Leonard Gehringer and Theresa (Hahn) (Eisele) Gehringer, both German Catholic immigrants. Both of his parents had been married previously, and Charlie had eight half-siblings from Leonard&#x27;s first marriage, and a half-sister from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. As a young boy the family moved to a different rented farm just south of Fowlerville, in Handy Township.

In 1922 after graduating from Fowlerville High School, Gehringer enrolled at the University of Michigan. He took physical education classes and played basketball and baseball. Gehringer later recalled that he lettered in basketball but not baseball.

==Professional baseball==
===Discovery and minor leagues (1923 to 1925)===
In the fall of 1923, after his first year at the University of Michigan, Gehringer was discovered by Detroit Tigers left fielder Bobby Veach. Veach was hunting in Fowlerville when a friend, Floyd Smith, recommended that Veach have a look at Gehringer. Veach brought him to Navin Field to work out and show the Tigers what he could do. Player-manager Ty Cobb was reportedly so impressed that he asked club owner Frank Navin to sign Gehringer to a contract on the spot. &quot;I knew Charlie would hit and I was so anxious to sign him that I didn&#x27;t even take the time to change out of my uniform before rushing him into the front office to sign a contract.&quot; &quot;Ty Cobb&quot;

In 1924, Gehringer played with London Tecumsehs in the Class B Michigan Ontario League. He was called up briefly at the end of September and played five games for the Tigers, batting .462 in 13 at-bats. He returned to the minor leagues where he played in 1925 for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, compiling a .325 batting average with 206 hits and 25 home runs. In a brief call-up at the end of the 1925 season, he appeared in eight games for the Tigers, compiling a .167 battng average in 18 at bats.

===Relationship with Cobb (1926)===
Gehringer&#x27;s made the Tigers&#x27; regular-season roster in the spring of 1926. When second baseman Frank O&#x27;Rourke contracted measles, Gehringer played his first game as a starter on April 28, 1926. Gehringer committed two costly errors and was hitless in four at bats, leading the Associated Press to write:Yesterday there was written at Navin field the sad story of the ambitious small town boy from a quiet Michigan village and his big league debut. It was sad because the ambitious boy, who has been called by Ty Cobb one of the best natural ball players he ever saw, made two glaring errors and otherewise deported himself unseemingly.

Gehringer took over as the Tigers&#x27; second baseman, appearing in 112 games at the position in 1926. He hit .277 and tallied 17 triples, second best in the American League. Playing for the &quot;small ball&quot; oriented Cobb, Gehringer also had a career-high 27 sacrifice hits in 1926. After Cobb&#x27;s departure, Gehringer never again came close to 27 sacrifice hits.

At first, Gehringer recalled that Cobb &quot;was like a father to me.&quot; Gehringer&#x27;s father had died in 1924. Cobb even made Gehringer use his own bat. According to Gehringer, Cobb&#x27;s bat was &quot;a thin little thing&quot;, and though Gehringer would have preferred a bigger bat, &quot;I didn&#x27;t dare use another one.&quot; Cobb and Gehringer subsequently had a falling out. Cobb told Gehringer he needed more &quot;pepper&quot; and should &quot;chatter like the rest of the infield.&quot; Cobb became peeved when Gehringer replied that &quot;there were enough people talking and saying nothing.&quot; Gehringer later described Cobb as &quot;a real hateful guy.&quot; (&quot;Al Stump, Cobb: The Life and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball&quot; (1994), p. 419)

===Gehringer becomes a star: 1927–1933===

After the 1926 season, Cobb left the Tigers and was replaced as manager by George Moriarty. During the off-season, Moriarty acquired Marty McManus from the St. Louis Browns. Moriarty chose McManus as his starting second baseman at the start of the 1927 season, but McManus was benched for disciplinary reasons, giving Gehringer the opportunity to return to the starting lineup at second base.

Gehringer seized the opportunity and had his breakout season in 1927. He led the American League&#x27;s second basemen with 438 assists, 84 double plays turned, and a range factor of 6.19. He also blossomed as a batter, batting .317 and scoring 110 runs — fourth best in the American League.

In 1928, he played in all 154 games for the Tigers, beginning a streak of 511 consecutive games. He hit .320, collected 193 hits (fifth best in the league), scored 108 runs (fifth best in the league), and had 507 assists (best in the league for a second baseman). At the end of the 1928 season, Gehringer placed 19th in the voting for the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Gehringer&#x27;s steady improvement continued in 1929, as he hit .339 with an on-base percentage of .405, a slugging percentage of .532, and 106 RBIs. He also led the American League with 215 hits, 45 doubles, 19 triples (including three in one game on August 5), 131 runs scored, and 27 stolen bases. He also led the league in putouts (404) and fielding percentage (.975) by a second baseman and ranked second with 501 assists.

In 1930, Gehringer hit .330 with a .404 on-base percentage and a .534 slugging percentage. He also scored 144 runs (third in the league) and collected 201 hits, 78 extra base hits, 47 doubles (third in the league), 15 triples (5th in the league), and 19 stolen bases (second in the league).

In relative terms, 1931 was an &quot;off&quot; year for Gehringer. His consecutive game streak ended in May, and he appeared in only 101 games. He also fell below the .300 mark (batting .298) for the only time between 1926 and 1941. Gehringer still had a fine year by most standards, and ended up No. 17 in the 1931 American League Most Valuable Player voting.

In 1932, Gehringer was back at full strength, playing in 152 games and hitting .325 with 112 runs, 107 RBI, and 44 doubles (second best in the league). Not generally known as a power hitter, Gehringer also hit 19 home runs in 1932, seventh best in the American League. At the end of the year, Gehringer was ninth in the league&#x27;s MVP voting.

In 1933, he played in all 155 games for the Tigers, batting .330 (fifth best in the American League), and collecting 204 hits (second in the league), 42 doubles (fourth in the league), 105 RBIs, and a career-high 542 assists (best in the league for second basemen). Gehringer was once again among the top vote recipients in the 1933 MVP voting, this time placing sixth.

===A quiet man===

Gehringer had a reputation as quiet and unassuming. Player-manager Mickey Cochrane joked that &quot;Charlie says &#x27;hello&#x27; on Opening Day, &#x27;goodbye&#x27; on closing day, and in between hits .350.&quot;

Gehringer acknowledged his quiet demeanor:
&quot;I wasn&#x27;t a rabble rouser. I wasn&#x27;t a big noisemaker in the infield, which a lot of managers think you&#x27;ve got to be or you&#x27;re not showing. But I don&#x27;t think it contributes much.&quot; Gehringer also had a sense of humor about his reputation. At a civic banquet in his honor, Gehringer&#x27;s entire speech consisted of the following: &quot;I&#x27;m known around baseball as saying very little, and I&#x27;m not going to spoil my reputation.&quot; When asked why he signed his name &quot;Chas. Gehringer&quot;, he responded: &quot;Why use seven letters when four will do?&quot; On another occasion, when asked about his closed-lip reputation, he responded: &quot;Not true; if somebody asked me a question, I would answer them. If they said, &#x27;Pass the salt,&#x27; I would pass the salt.&quot;

His unassuming nature is also reflected in his reaction to a &quot;Charlie Gehringer Day&quot; held by the Tigers in 1929. Fans from Gehringer&#x27;s hometown and throughout Detroit filled the stands for a 17–13 win over the Yankees. Gehringer handled 10 chances at second base, had four hits including a home run, and stole home. In a ceremony, the people of Fowlerville presented Gehringer with a set of golf clubs. Though the clubs were right-handed, and Gehringer was left-handed, Gehringer learned to golf right-handed rather than trade for a left-handed set of clubs.

===Back-to-back pennants (1934 and 1935)===

In 1934, Gehringer had his best year to date, playing all 154 games and leading the Tigers to their first American League pennant in 25 years. His .356 batting average and .450 on-base percentage were both second best in the league. He led the league with 134 runs scored and 214 hits and tallied 42 doubles (second best in the league) and a career-high 127 RBIs (fifth best in the league). Gehringer finished second in the 1934 American League MVP voting, just two points behind Detroit&#x27;s player-manager, Mickey Cochrane.

The Detroit infield in the mid-1930s was one of the best-hitting combinations in major league history. With Hank Greenberg at first, Gehringer at second, Billy Rogell at shortstop, and Marv Owen at third, the 1934 Tigers infield collected 769 hits (214 by Gehringer, 201 by Greenberg, 179 by Owen and 175 by Rogell), 462 RBI (139 by Greenberg, 127 by Gehringer, 100 by Rogell, and 96 by Owen), and 179 doubles (63 by Greenberg, 50 by Gehringer, 34 by Owen and 32 by Rogell). Three members of the 1934 Tigers infield (Gehringer, Owen and Rogell) played in all 154 games, and the fourth (Greenberg) played in 153.

Gehringer&#x27;s 127 RBIs in 1934 is all the more remarkable given the fact that he played in the same lineup with one of the greatest RBI men of all time, Hank Greenberg. Gehringer later recalled that Greenberg would tell him: &quot;Just get the runner over to third&quot;, so Hank could drive them in. Gehringer noted that &quot;Hank loved those RBIs&quot;, to the point that Gehringer once kidded Greenberg: &quot;You&#x27;d trip a runner coming around third base just so you could knock him in yourself.&quot;

The 1934 World Series was a match-up between St. Louis&#x27;s &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot; and Detroit&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;G-Men&quot; (so named because of stars Gehringer, Hank Greenberg, and Goose Goslin). Even 50 years later, Gehringer (interviewed in 1982) felt the Tigers were robbed of the 1934 championship by umpire Brick Owens. Detroit was ahead three games to two, and in Gehringer&#x27;s view &quot;we should&#x27;ve won the sixth game.&quot; Late in the game, Brick Owens called Mickey Cochrane out on a play at third base &quot;even though all of the photographs show that he was safe by a mile.&quot; Gehringer insisted that, if Cochrane had been called safe, &quot;we would&#x27;ve had the bases loaded with nobody out and we could&#x27;ve had a big inning.&quot; The Tigers wound up losing Game 6 by one run. They then lost Game 7 in an 11–0 shutout thrown by Dizzy Dean, despite a two-for-four game from Gehringer. Gehringer played all seven games of the 1934 World Series, batting .379 with an on-base percentage of .438 and a .517 slugging percentage.

In 1935, Gehringer and the Tigers won the World Series, beating the Chicago Cubs, four games to two. It was the Tigers&#x27; first World Series win, after failing in the fall classic in four previous appearances. For the year, Gehringer hit .330 with a .409 on-base percentage and a .502 slugging percentage, collecting 201 hits, 123 runs, 108 RBIs, and 19 home runs.

Gehringer also continued his consistent hitting into the 1935 World Series, where he played all six games, and hit .375 with a .423 on-base percentage, a .500 slugging percentage and four RBIs.

===Life in the off-season===

During the off-season, Gehringer worked as a sales clerk in the downtown Detroit Hudson&#x27;s. He also spent many years barnstorming with other Major League players. One year, he traveled with a touring group from the Negro leagues, including Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Judy Johnson, and Mule Suttles. Gehringer recalled that trying to hit Paige&#x27;s fastball and hesitation pitch was &quot;no fun.&quot; Paige said that Gehringer was the best white hitter he ever pitched against.

===Peak years (1936 and 1937)===
Although the 1936 Tigers finished in second place, 19½ games behind the Yankees, the 33-year-old Gehringer had one of his best seasons. He led the majors with 60 doubles, one of only six times in major-league history that a batter has reached the 60-double mark. He led the American League in assists, double plays, and fielding percentage by a second baseman. And he had career highs in hits (227) slugging percentage (.555), runs (144), extra-base hits (87), total bases (356) and runs created (152). He also had a career-low 13 strikeouts in 641 at-bats during the 1936 season. He finished fourth in the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, as Lou Gehrig became the only non-Tiger to win the MVP award from 1934 to 1937.

In 1937, Gehringer won the American League batting crown with a career-high .371 batting average, 20 points ahead of second-place Lou Gehrig. He placed second to Gehrig with a .458 on-base percentage, collected 209 hits (his seventh 200-hit season), and scored 133 runs (one of twelve 100-plus run seasons). At the end of the season, he received the American League Most Valuable Player award, receiving six of the eight first-place votes and edging Joe DiMaggio by a total of 78 points to 74 points. At a banquet honoring Gehringer in November 1937, Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane said: Gehringer is the ideal player from the managerial standpoint. He comes to training camp in the spring and says &#x27;Hello, Mike, how are you.&#x27; Then Charley goes along through the season, bats .350 or better and, after the season, comes around and says – &#x27;So long Mike, have a good winter.&#x27;

===The &quot;Mechanical Man&quot;===
Known for his consistency as a hitter and fielder, Gehringer was known as &quot;The Mechanical Man&quot;. The earliest known contemporary account referring to Gehringer by the nickname is a May 1936 story crediting Lynwood Lary with creating the nickname and saying, &quot;The guy just ain&#x27;t human; he&#x27;s a machine.&quot; The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; at that time noted, &quot;As steady as a turbine, Gehringer comes nearer to mechanical perfection than any infielder since the days of Napoleon Lajoie.&quot; Other sources credit New York Yankees pitcher Lefty Gomez with giving him the nickname. According to one source, Gomez said: &quot;You wind him up in the spring, turn him loose, he hits .330 or .340, and you shut him off at the end of the season.&quot;

Gehringer was also durable, having compiled two of the longest consecutive game streaks in major-league history — a 511-game streak from September 3, 1927, to May 7, 1931, and a 504-game streak from June 25, 1932, to August 11, 1935.

===Rogell and Gehringer===

Gehringer played over 1,000 games with shortstop Billy Rogell, making them one of the longest-tenured double-play combinations in the history of the game. The two twice led the league in double plays. (Another Tiger duo, Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell, holds the major league record with 1,918 games played as a double-play combination.)

Rogell&#x27;s fiery demeanor was a stark contrast to the calm, quiet demeanor of Gehringer. On one occasion, after both failed to cover second on a steal attempt, player-manager Mickey Cochrane charged out from behind the plate shouting at Rogell and Gehringer. As reported in &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (2001): &quot;Rogell, astonished, looked at Gehringer to see if he was going to say anything. Gehringer, of course, had nothing to say. &#x27;Goddamn you,&#x27; yelled Rogell. &#x27;Don&#x27;t you come charging out here telling me how to play shortstop. You go back there and do the catching, and I&#x27;ll play shortstop. If I&#x27;m not good enough, you can find someone else.&#x27; Cochrane went back to his own position.&quot;

===1938 to 1939===
In 1938, Gehringer was selected as the starting second baseman for the American League All-Star team for the sixth consecutive year. He was the only person to play every inning of the first six All-Star games. He batted .500 and did not strike out or commit an error in his six All-Star games.

Gehringer hit a career-high 20 home runs in 1938 and again ranked among the American League&#x27;s leaders with 133 runs scored (third), a .425 on-base percentage (sixth), and 113 bases on balls (fourth). Gehringer finished tenth in the AL MVP voting in 1938.

Gehringer had another strong season in 1939. For the sixth time in his career, he led the American League second baseman in fielding percentage (.977), and he ranked among the league leaders in batting with a .325 batting average (ninth in AL), .423 on-base percentage (8th in AL), and .544 slugging percentage (seventh in AL).

===Back problems (1940 and 1941)===
Gehringer suffered from chronic back trouble. According to one account, he injured his back while shoveling snow. The trouble was such that there were doubts as to whether he would be able to play at all in 1940. Gehringer later recalled his struggles during the 1940 season: &quot;Anytime I tried to field a ball off to either side I felt I&#x27;d collapse. Often I couldn&#x27;t stoop over to puck up a ball after blocking it. I&#x27;ve had so many heat treatments I feel like a boiled oyster. At times i didnt&#x27; think I could move two steps or get the bat off my shoulder.&quot; Despite that back pain, Gehringer started 138 games at second base in 1940 and compiled a .313 batting average. The Tigers won the American League pennant in 1940, but lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1940 World Series. Gehringer&#x27;s back problems were such that, by the time of the World Series, he &quot;covered little ground and seldom got the break on the ball.&quot; After Game 7, Gehringer announced that he had likely played his final season noting, &quot;Playing ball was torture for me. I was in agony nearly the entire time.&quot;

During the off-season, Gehringer attempted new treatments, felt better, and returned for the 1941 season. He started 115 games at second base and registered a .982 fielding percentage, best in the American League. However, his batting average dropped almost 100 points from .313 in 1940 to .220 in 1941. His defensive prowess also suffered, Detroit sports writer Watson Spoelstra noting in July that &quot;ground balls that once were easy for him are filtering through for base hits.&quot;

===Coach in 1942===
Gehringer decided to retire after the 1941 season. In January 1942, he signed a contract to return to the club as a nonplaying coach assigned to coaching infielders and batters. In late May 1942, Gehringer was restored to the active list, allowing him to be available for pinch-hitting duty. He appeared in 45 games in 1942, compiling a .267 batting average in 45 at bats. He also played 16 innings at second base without an error.

===Career statistics===

*In 20 World Series games (1934, 1935, and 1940), Gehringer hit .321 (26-for-81) with 12 runs, 4 doubles, 1 home run, 7 RBI, 2 stolen bases, and 7 walks.
*He has recorded six 5-hit games and 52 4-hit games in his MLB career.
*He was difficult to strike out, fanning only 372 times in 8,860 at-bats, or once every 23.8 at-bats.

==Military service and retirement from baseball==
Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, baseball players began to be inducted into the military service. In August 1942, the 39-year-old Gehringer reported for a physical examination at the Navy&#x27;s procurement headquarters in Detroit. At a ceremony in Detroit on December 1, 1942, he was inducted into the Navy as a lieutenant. At the time, Gehringer told reporters, &quot;I think it may be the end of baseball for me.&quot;

Gehringer was assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Pre-Flight School at Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California. He played second base for the St. Mary&#x27;s Pre-Flight baseball team. He was also the head baseball and soccer coach at the St. Mary&#x27;s Pre-Flight School.

Gehringer was later transferred to the Navy&#x27;s Pre-Flight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and in February 1945 to Jacksonville, Florida. In 1945, he led the Jacksonville Naval Air Station Fliers baseball team to a 24–5 record and compiled a .438 batting average.

Gehringer was discharged from the Navy on November 7, 1945, with the rank of lieutenant commander. Upon his release, he was 42 years old and announced his retirement from baseball and his intention to return to work at Gehringer &amp; Forsyth, a manufacturers&#x27; agency he formed in 1938 with a friend. He confirmed his retirement at Briggs Stadium in January 1946, signing his &quot;Application for Voluntary Retirement from Organized Baseball&quot;. Gehringer later recalled, &quot;I came out of the service in such good shape that I felt I could&#x27;ve played a few years.&quot;

==Family and later years==
===Relationship with mother===
Gehringer&#x27;s father died in July 1924. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Gehringer moved his mother from the family farm outside Fowlerville, Michigan, to live with him in Detroit. Gehringer noted that his mother was a &quot;great fan&quot; who would either come out to the ballpark to watch him play or listen to Harry Heilmann&#x27;s radio broadcasts on the porch. His mother died in July 1946.

===Wedding and Hall of Fame===
In the regular voting in 1949 for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Gehringer finished in first place with 102 out of 153 votes, but it fell short of the required 75 percent. The baseball writers decided to conduct a run-off election in May 1949. Gehringer was selected by 159 of the 187 writers (85%) in the runoff voting, qualifying him for the Hall of Fame. Gehringer did not attend the induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, as it was held five days before his wedding. He was married in June 1949 to Josephine Stillen, a secretary at the Nash-Kelvinator Corp. The ceremony was held in Santa Clara, California. The couple remained married until Gehringer&#x27;s death more than four decades later.

===Tigers&#x27; general manager===

In July 1951, Gehringer was hired as the Tigers&#x27; vice president and general manager, effective after the 1951 season. In his first year as general manager, the 1952 Detroit Tigers finished in last place (50–104 record) for the first time in club history. Although manager Red Rolfe did not survive the disappointing season, having been fired in July, the club&#x27;s board of directors in September 1952 gave Gehringer a unanimous vote of confidence.

The 1953 team improved only marginally, finishing with a 60–94 record, 40½ games behind the New York Yankees. After another disappointing season, Gehringer was replaced as general manager in October 1953. Although the team&#x27;s on-field performance was poor during Gehringer&#x27;s time as general manager, Lyall Smith of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; praised Gehringer for his trades that helped rebuild the club and brought 21 players to the team, including Walt Dropo, Fred Hatfield, Johnny Pesky, Ned Garver, Jim Delsing, Ray Boone, and Steve Gromek.

Gehringer later described his time as general manager as a &quot;nightmare.&quot; As he put it: &quot;We had a lousy ball club, and I&#x27;d been away from baseball at that time for ten years. I didn&#x27;t know who was and who wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

Gehringer remained a vice president with the Tigers during parts of the 1950s. He was the first Detroit official to scout Al Kaline. After watching Kaline in a high-school all-star game, Gehringer returned to Detroit &quot;raving about the kid&quot; and assigned scout Al Katalinas to continue watching him.

Gehringer returned to the Tigers in 1963 as a fielding instructor to the team&#x27;s young second baseman Dick McAuliffe and as a batting instructor.

===Later years and honors===
After his playing career ended, Gehringer returned to Gehringer &amp; Forsyth, a manufacturer&#x27;s agent for companies making automobile interior furnishings, including Burlington Automotive Fabrics, Barform carpets, and Cadillac Rubber &amp; Plastics. In 1967, the company built the three-story, contemporary Gehringer &amp; Forsyth building on Woodward Avenue north of Long Lake Road in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

Gehringer also served as a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Committee on Baseball Veterans from 1953 to 1990. He also served on the Hall of Fame&#x27;s board of directors until 1991.

At a June 1983 ceremony in Tiger Stadium, the Tigers retired uniform numbers 2 and 5, worn for many years by teammates Gehringer and Hank Greenberg respectively. Both players attended the ceremony.

At age 82, Gehringer served as the American League honorary captain at the 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.

Gehringer suffered from a stroke in December 1992 and died the following month at age 89 at a nursing home in Bloomfield Hills.

===Posthumous honors===

In 1999, Gehringer ranked Number 46 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Also in 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published a list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Sports Figures from Michigan&quot; (in all sports), and ranked Gehringer third on the list behind Joe Louis and Magic Johnson.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Gehringer as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

<text>Tatyana Nikolayevna Savicheva (), commonly referred to as Tanya Savicheva ( – ), was a Russian teenage diarist who kept a diary in 1942 whilst enduring the siege of Leningrad during World War II. During the siege, Savicheva recorded the successive deaths of each member of her family in her diary, with her final entry indicating her belief to be the sole living family member. Although Savicheva was rescued and transferred to a hospital, she succumbed to intestinal tuberculosis in July 1944 at age 14.

Savicheva&#x27;s image and the pages from her diary became symbolic of the human cost of the siege of Leningrad, and she is remembered in St. Petersburg with a memorial complex on the Green Belt of Glory along the Road of Life. Her diary was used during the Nuremberg Trials as evidence of the Nazis’ crimes.

==Early life==
Savicheva was born on 23 January 1930, the youngest child in the family of a baker father, Nikolay Rodionovich Savichev, and a seamstress mother, Mariya Ignatievna Savicheva. Her father died when Tanya was six, leaving his widow with five children: three girls — Tanya, Zhenya (Yevgenia) and Nina — and two boys — Mikhail and Leka (Leonid). Mikhail had left Leningrad before war broke out. Whilst in German-occupied territory at Kingisepp Mikhail had joined the partisans. Mikhail&#x27;s story was not known to the rest of his family who presumed him to be dead.

The family planned to spend the summer of 1941 in the countryside, but the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June disrupted their plans. All, except Mikhail (Misha), who had already left, decided to stay in Leningrad. Each of them worked to support the army: Mariya Ignatievna sewed uniforms, Leka worked as a plane operator in the Admiralty, Zhenya worked at the munitions factory, Nina helped in the construction of city defences and worked at the munitions factory with her sister, and her uncles Vasya and Lesha served in the anti-aircraft defence. Tanya, then 11 years old, dug trenches and put out firebombs. One day Nina went to work and never came back; she was sent to Lake Ladoga and then urgently evacuated. The family was unaware of this and presumed she had died.

==Origins of the diary==
Tanya had kept a real diary in previous months. This diary had been a large, thick notebook in which she recorded her day-to-day life, but the family had decided to burn it at some point early on in the siege when there was no fuel left to heat the stove. Some time after the burning of her diary Savicheva was given a small notebook that had belonged to her sister Nina, which would later become her diary. The smaller notebook had been spared the fire and Nina had used it to make notes about the boiler equipment in the plant where she worked. Nina had not used the alphabetised portion of the notebook.

Tanya wrote her first entry in the diary on or shortly after 28 December. This first entry concerned the death of her elder sister Zhenya, which most likely occurred due to severe malnutrition exacerbated by her work at the munitions factory. Zhenya was born in 1909 and had left the family home when she married and had moved to Mokhovaya Street, where she continued to live after her divorce. Zhenya would regularly walk 7 kilometers (4 miles) to the factory where she worked sometimes two shifts a day making mine cases. After work she would donate blood. At this point during the siege of Leningrad, food rationing had been reduced to starvation level, and only small but inadequate supplies were coming into Leningrad across Lake Ladoga along the Road of Life. It is estimated 100,000 people per month were dying from starvation, rations for an adult having been set at 250g (9 oz) of rye bread or half that for children and the elderly. Her weakened body was not strong enough to stand the blood donations and she died in her apartment, from complications resulting from exhaustion and malnutrition, in the arms of her sister Nina who had been worried when she had not turned up for her shift at the factory and had hurried round to Mokhovaya Street to check on her.

==Deaths==
Savicheva began to record the deaths of each family member in her half empty work notebook. Each page had a letter heading; Savicheva chose the page headed by Russian letter Ж and recorded the death of her sister with the following statement written probably in blue pencil, in large handwriting which filled the page, &quot;Zhenya died on December 28th at 12 noon, 1941.&quot;

From here on, most of Tanya&#x27;s family also died in quick succession. Her grandmother, Yevdokiya Grigorievna, died a month later, two days after Savicheva&#x27;s twelfth birthday, of heart failure, having lost a third of her body weight. Yevdokiya Grigorievna refused to go to hospital as she felt the hospitals were overrun enough already. She was buried in a mass grave in what is today&#x27;s Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, where there is a memorial complex to the victims of the siege. Savicheva recorded her death under the page heading for the letter Б with the words &quot;Grandma died on the 25th of January at 3 o&#x27;clock, 1942.&quot;

Tanya later admitted that at the behest of their grandmother they postponed the burial and kept Yevdokiya&#x27;s ration card until the end of the month; thus, the official date of her death was recorded as 1 February 1942.

On 28 February, Nina disappeared. On the day of her disappearance Leningrad had come under heavy artillery fire and the remaining family presumed her to be dead. In fact Nina Savicheva had been evacuated without warning across Lake Ladoga on the dangerous Road of Life ice route. Nina had no opportunity to send word to any of her relatives, the ice route being reserved only for essential food, fuel, medicine and evacuation purposes. She remained ill for several months and was not able to return to Leningrad to find out what had happened to her family until 1945. Savicheva made no reference to Nina in the notebook. It was Nina who eventually found the diary on returning to Leningrad.

Grandmother&#x27;s death was followed by Savicheva&#x27;s brother Leka in March 1942. He had tried earlier in the war to enlist in the military but had been turned down because of nearsightedness. Leka had become a promising engineer, and was also a talented musician. He worked long shifts at the Admiralty Shipyard, often working a second shift into the night. He died in the shipyard&#x27;s hospital on 17 March, Savicheva hurriedly recording this in her diary under the letter Л, &quot;Leka died March 17th at 5 o&#x27;clock in the morning, 1942.&quot;

On 13 April, Uncle Vasya (one of her father&#x27;s brothers) died at the age of 56. Before the war three of Savicheva&#x27;s uncles lived together in a nearby apartment but when the siege began the family moved in together. Uncle Vasya had served in the First World War but had been refused this time around on account of his age. Vasya and Tanya were said to be very close and Tanya spent many hours in Vasya&#x27;s apartment which was filled with books. Savicheva recorded his death under the letter В, mixing up some of her grammar, with the words &quot;Uncle Vasya died on April 13th at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning, 1942.&quot;

The death of her eldest uncle Lesha followed in May at the age of 71 from malnutrition. He too had tried to enlist in the military but was refused, being too old. Despite his age he remained active in the civilian effort in Leningrad. Savicheva recorded his death on the facing page of the letter Л and left off the word &#x27;died&#x27;. &quot;Uncle Lesha May 10th, at 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, 1942&quot;

Finally her mother died on the morning of 13 May 1942. Mariya Ignatievna Savicheva was born in 1889 and worked as a seamstress, which she continued during the civilian war effort by sewing soldiers&#x27; uniforms. Mariya had loved music and encouraged all her children to play in a family ensemble. Savicheva recorded her death under the letter М, again making grammatical errors and missing the word &#x27;died&#x27;: &quot;Mama on May 13th at 7:30 in the morning, 1942.&quot;
Following the death of her mother it seems Savicheva lost hope and under three more letters: С, У and О she filled three more pages with the words

&quot;The Savichevs are dead.&quot; &quot;Everyone is dead.&quot; &quot;Only Tanya is left.&quot;

==After her rescue==
After the death of her mother, Savicheva stayed with a neighbour the next night and then, although severely weakened, took the family&#x27;s personal belongings to the house of her aunt Evdokiya (Dusya). Her aunt, hoping Savicheva might receive urgent medical care, then transferred custody of Savicheva to public orphanage number 48 in the Smolny area of St. Petersburg. In August 1942, Tanya was one of the 140 children who were rescued from Leningrad and brought to the village of Krasny Bor. Anastasiya Karpova, a teacher in the Krasny Bor orphanage, wrote to Tanya&#x27;s brother Mikhail, who happened to be outside of Leningrad in 1941: &quot;Tanya is now alive, but she doesn&#x27;t look healthy. A doctor, who visited her recently, says she is very ill. She needs rest, special care, nutrition, better climate and, most of all, tender motherly care.&quot; In May 1944, Tanya was sent to a hospital in Shatki, where she died a month later, on 1 July, of intestinal tuberculosis.

Nina Savicheva and Mikhail Savichev returned to Leningrad after World War II. Mikhail had continued fighting until 1944, sustaining injuries which led to him being discharged and transported back to Leningrad. Tanya&#x27;s diary is now displayed at the Museum of Leningrad History, with a copy also on display at the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery.
 According to several sources, one of the documents presented by the Allied prosecutors during the Nuremberg Trials was the small notebook that once belonged to Tanya.

==Contents of the diary==




==Legacy==

Tanya and her diary have become an iconic image of the victims of the siege of Leningrad in the postwar Soviet Union. In 1968 a memorial was constructed in her honor which was later expanded to a memorial complex. The memorial complex, known as &quot;The Flower of Life&quot; («Цветок жизни») consists of a large stone flower designed by A.D. Levyenkov and P.I. Melnikov and eight stone tabets representing pages of her diary where she writes of the members of her family who died, designed by Levyenkov, G.G. Fetisov, and engineer M.V. Koman. It is located on the Green Belt of Glory near St. Petersburg. The memorial is dedicated to children who endured the siege of Leningrad.

At Krasny Bor cemetery where Savicheva is buried there is a red marble tomb with a grey marble grave stone depicting her image in bas relief, sculpted by T. Holueva. Close by is a tall stele with a monumental wall depicting carved pages from her diary.

Serbian poet Mika Antić penned a poem dedicated to Tanya Savicheva named &quot;A lost &quot;.

2127 Tanya, a minor planet discovered in 1971 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh, is named in her honor.

There is also a mountain pass named after her in the Dzungarian Alatau mountain range which lies between Kazakhstan and China.

There are memorial plaques on the wall and in the courtyard of her home on Vasilievsky Island, St. Petersburg, and a museum housed in the school she attended.

Copies of the diary have been displayed in exhibitions around the world and the original is displayed at The State Museum of the History of St. Petersburg at Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.

<text>The Frascati Manual is a document setting forth the methodology for collecting statistics about research and development. The Manual was prepared and published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

== Contents ==
The Frascati Manual classifies budgets according to what is done, what is studied, and who is studying it. For example, an oral history project conducted by a religious organization would be classified as being basic research, in the field of humanities (the sub-category of history), and performed by a non-governmental, non-profit organization.

=== Three forms of research ===
The manual gives definitions for: basic research, applied research, Research and development; research personnel: researchers, technicians, auxiliary personnel. 

The Frascati Manual classifies research into three categories:

* &quot;Basic research&quot; is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.
* &quot;Applied research&quot; is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective.
* &quot;Experimental development&quot; is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.

These involve novelty, creativity, uncertainty, systematic, and reproducibility and transferability.

===Research areas===
It also organizes the fields of scholarly research endeavors, from mathematics to literature, into main and sub-categories. The 2002 Frascati Manual included a &#x27;Field of Science&#x27; (FOS) classification. After several reviews, a Revised Fields of Science and Technology (FOS) classification was published in February 2007 consisting of the following high-level groupings:

# Natural sciences
# Engineering and technology
# Medical and Health sciences
# Agricultural sciences
# Social sciences
# Humanities

=== Industry sectors ===
The Frascati Manual deals primarily with measuring the expenditure and personnel resources devoted to R&amp;D in the industry sectors performing it: higher education, government, business, and private non-profit organisations.

== History ==
In June 1963, OECD experts met with the NESTI group (National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators) at the Villa Falconieri in Frascati, Italy. Based on a background document by Christopher Freeman they drafted the first version of Frascati Manual, which is officially known as The Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development. In 2002 the 6th edition was published.

== Use ==
The definitions provided in the Frascati Manual have been adopted by many governments and serve as a common language for discussions of science and technology policy and economic development policy. Originally an OECD standard, it has become an acknowledged standard in R&amp;D studies all over the world and is widely used by various organisations associated with the United Nations and European Union. As of 2000, approximately 75% of countries used this method to share information about their budgets.

Over the past 40 years, the NESTI group has developed a series of documents, known as the &quot;Frascati Family&quot;, that includes manuals on R&amp;D (Frascati Manual), innovation (Oslo Manual), human resources (Canberra Manual), technology, balance of payments, and patents as indicators of science and technology.

<text>A download manager is a type of software that manages the downloading of files from the Internet, which may be built into a web browser, or as a standalone program.

== Functions ==
A download manager manages files being downloaded from the internet. Download managers break down files into multiple chunks for faster download speeds and allocate resources for downloading multiple items simultaneously. Failed downloads can also be restarted from a download manager. Download managers may be separate programs or may be built into web browsers or other programs, such as Firefox&#x27;s and Telegram&#x27;s built-in download managers.

== Criticism ==
Download managers are occasionally used to spread malware or advertisements onto a user&#x27;s computer. For example, the download page for Free Download Manager was hacked and used to spread malware on Linux devices from 2020 to 2022. Other download managers have been noted to contain advertisements, be identified as malware by antivirus software, or attempt to install unwanted software during installation.

<doc id="337534" wikidata="Q1634713" url="?curid=337534" title="Hughie Jennings">
<text>Hugh Ambrose Jennings (April 2, 1869 – February 1, 1928) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager from 1891 to 1925. Jennings was a leader, both as a batter and as a shortstop, with the Baltimore Orioles teams that won National League championships in , , and . During those three seasons, Jennings had 355 runs batted in and hit .335, .386, and .401.

Jennings was a fiery, hard-nosed player who was not afraid to be hit by a pitch to get on base. In 1896, he was hit by pitches 51 times – a major league record that has never been broken. Jennings also holds the career record for being hit by pitches with 287, with Craig Biggio (who retired in 2007) holding the modern-day career record of 285. Jennings also played on the Brooklyn Superbas teams that won National League pennants in 1899 and 1900. From 1907 to 1920, Jennings was the manager of the Detroit Tigers, where he was known for his colorful antics, hoots, whistles, and his famous shouts of &quot;Ee-Yah!&quot; from the third base coaching box. Jennings suffered a nervous breakdown in 1925 that forced him to leave Major League Baseball. In 1945, Jennings was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, Jennings was the son of Irish immigrants, James and Nora, who according to Jack Smiles&#x27;s biography of Jennings, &quot;Ee-yah: The Life and Times of Hughie Jennings, Baseball Hall of Famer&quot; (page 7), arrived in Pittston in 1851.

Jennings worked as a breaker boy (young boys who separated the coal from the slate) in the local anthracite coal mines. He drew attention playing shortstop for a semi-professional baseball team in Lehighton, Pennsylvania in 1890. He was signed by the Louisville Colonels of the American Association in . He stayed with the Colonels when they joined the National League in and was traded on June 7, to the Baltimore Orioles.

==Baltimore Orioles: 1893–1899==
Jennings played with the Orioles for parts of seven seasons and became a star during his years in Baltimore. The Baltimore Orioles teams of 1894, 1895, and 1896 are regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time. The teams featured Hall of Fame manager Ned Hanlon and a lineup with six future Hall of Famers: first baseman Dan Brouthers, second baseman John McGraw, shortstop Jennings, catcher Wilbert Robinson, right fielder &quot;Wee Willie&quot; Keeler, and left fielder Joe Kelley. Amidst all those great players, Jennings was appointed captain in 1894, his first full season with the team.

During the Orioles&#x27; championship years, Jennings had some of the best seasons ever by a major league shortstop. In 1895, he hit .386, scored 159 runs, collected 204 hits, knocked in 125 runs, and stole 53 bases. In 1896, his performance was even better, as he hit .401 (2nd best in the National League) with 209 hits, 121 RBI, and 70 stolen bases.

The fiery Jennings was also known as one of the most fearless players of his time, allowing himself to be hit by pitches more than any other player. In one game, he was hit by a pitch three times. In 1896, he was hit by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings was hit by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings was hit in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.

Jennings was also one of the best fielding shortstops of the era. He led the National League in fielding percentage and putouts three times each. He had as many as 537 assists and 425 putouts in single seasons during his prime. His 425 putouts ties him with Donie Bush for the single season record for a shortstop. In 1895, he had a career-high range factor of 6.73–1.19 points higher than the league average (5.54) for shortstops that year. He once handled 20 chances in a game, and on another occasion had 10 assists in a game. In 1898, he threw his arm out, and his career as a shortstop came to an end. After that, Jennings was forced to move to first base.

==Brooklyn Superbas and Philadelphia Phillies: 1899–1903==
In 1899, when manager Ned Hanlon moved to the Brooklyn Superbas, several of his star players, including Jennings, Joe Kelley, and Willie Keeler followed. While Jennings was never the same after the injury to his arm in 1898, he contributed to Brooklyn&#x27;s National League pennants in and .

In 1901, Jennings was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. However, his failing arm cut his career short, as he never played in more than 82 games or hit above .272 in two seasons with the Phillies. Jennings played 6 games for the Superbas in 1903, effectively ending his playing career, with the exception of 9 at bats during his tenure as the manager of the Detroit Tigers.

==Cornell Law School and an off-season law practice==
While playing for the Orioles in the 1890s, Jennings and John McGraw both attended classes at St. Bonaventure University. After the 1899 season, Jennings was accepted to Cornell Law School. He managed the Cornell University baseball team while studying law and concluded that he was well-suited to being a manager. While at Cornell, he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity chapter there. Jennings continued as a scholar-athlete until the spring of 1904, when he left campus early to manage the Orioles. Though he never finished his law degree at Cornell, Jennings passed the Maryland bar exam in 1905 and started a law practice. Jennings practiced law in Baltimore and in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He continued to work at his law practice during the off-seasons through the remainder of his baseball career.

==The &quot;Ee-Yah&quot; years: 1907–1920==
In , Jennings was hired as manager of a talented Detroit Tigers team that included future Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford. Jennings led the Tigers to three consecutive American League pennants, in –-. However, Jennings&#x27;s teams lost the 1907 and 1908 World Series to the &quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot; Chicago Cubs and the 1909 Series to Honus Wagner&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates. Jennings continued to manage the Tigers through the season, though his teams never won another pennant.

During his years as Detroit&#x27;s manager, Jennings became famous for his antics, mostly in the third base coaching box, which variously included shouts of &quot;Ee-Yah&quot;, and other whoops, whistles, horns, gyrations, jigs, and grass-plucking. The &quot;Ee-Yah&quot; whoop became his trademark and was accompanied with waves of both arms over his head and a sharp raising of his right knee. In 1907, he was suspended for taunting opponents with a tin whistle. The &quot;Ee-Yah&quot; shouts continued and became such a trademark that Jennings became known as Hughie &quot;Ee-Yah&quot; Jennings, and Detroit fans would shout &quot;Ee-Yah&quot; when Jennings appeared on the field. (See also Jack Smiles, &quot;Ee-yah: The Life And Times Of Hughie Jennings, Baseball Hall Of Famer&quot;)

Behind the antics was a great coaching mind. Connie Mack called Jennings one of the three greatest managers in history, along with John McGraw and Joe McCarthy. One of his greatest challenges, and accomplishments, during his years in Detroit was to manage the unmanageable—Ty Cobb. Jennings recognized Cobb&#x27;s talent and his complicated psychological makeup and concluded the best strategy would be to let Cobb be Cobb. Jennings reportedly called Cobb aside one day and said, &quot;There isn&#x27;t anything about baseball I can teach you. Anything I might say to you would merely hinder you in your development. The only thing for you to do is go ahead and do as you please. Use your own judgment.. . . . . Do what you think is best and I&#x27;ll back you up.&quot;

In , during a game in which &quot;pick-ups&quot; played for the Tigers when the regular team went on strike to protest the suspension of Cobb after an incident involving a fan in the stands whom Cobb assaulted, Jennings, who also sent his coaches in as substitute players, came to bat himself once as a pinch hitter. According to one source, when the umpire asked him for whom he was batting, Jennings answered, &quot;None of your business.&quot; The umpire noted on his lineup sheet, &quot;Jennings--batted for exercise.&quot;

While Jennings was fiery, hard-nosed, colorful, and even eccentric, he insisted he had always played the game honestly. When a scandal arose in concerning whether Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had fixed a game between the Detroit and the Cleveland Indians while Jennings was the manager, Jennings initially spoke of how easy it would be to fix a game and issued a &quot;no comment&quot; on the specific game. After his &quot;no comment&quot; drew negative publicity, Jennings issued a statement to the press in December 1926 denying knowledge of the matter and adding, &quot;My slate has been clean base ball for 35 years... Whatever I have done in base ball has been of such a nature that I would be ready any time to go before anyone and place my case before them.&quot; After the 1920 season, Jennings stepped down as the Tigers&#x27; manager. His 1,131 wins was the most in Tigers history until Sparky Anderson passed him in 1992.

==New York Giants: 1921–1925==
Jennings signed on as a coach with his old friend, John McGraw, who was managing the New York Giants. Jennings and McGraw, who met as teammates on the Orioles, became close friends. Jennings was the best man at McGraw&#x27;s wedding and a pallbearer following the death of McGraw&#x27;s 23-year-old wife in 1899. McGraw and Jennings staged a reunion year after year on their birthdays. Jennings won two World Series as a coach in and . When McGraw became ill, Jennings filled in as the Giants&#x27; manager for parts of and . His overall managing record was 1184–995.

==Managerial record==

==A lifetime of tragic accidents==
Jennings&#x27;s life was filled with several tragic accidents. There was the beaning incident in Philadelphia that left him unconscious for three days. While attending Cornell, he fractured his skull diving head-first into a swimming pool at night, only to find the pool had been emptied. In December 1911, Jennings came close to death after an off-season automobile accident. While driving a car given to him by admirers, Jennings&#x27;s car overturned while crossing a bridge over the Lehigh River near Gouldsboro, southeast of Scranton. In the crash, Jennings again fractured his skull, suffered a concussion of the brain, and broke both legs and his left arm. For several days after the accident, doctors were unsure if Jennings would survive.

The physical abuse and blows to the head undoubtedly took their toll. During the 1925 season, McGraw was ill, and Jennings was put in full charge of the Giants. The team finished in second place and the strain caught up with Jennings, who suffered a nervous breakdown when the season ended. According to his obituary, Jennings &quot;was unable to report&quot; to spring training in 1926 due to his condition. Jennings retired to the Winyah Sanatorium in Asheville, North Carolina. He did return home to Scranton, Pennsylvania, spending much of his time recuperating in the Pocono Mountains.

On February 1, 1928, Jennings died at age 58 at his home at 530 Vine Street in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The cause of death was spinal meningitis with tuberculosis as a contributory cause.

Jennings was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as a player.

<text>Kolhapur () is a city on the banks of the Panchganga River in the southern part of the Indian state of Maharashtra.

Kolhapur is one of the most significant cities in South Maharashtra and has been a hub of historical, religious, and cultural activities for centuries. It is famous for its unique food culture, including its signature Kolhapuri cuisine. The city is situated in the western part of Maharashtra and is often referred to as &quot;Dakshin Kashi&quot; or &quot;Mahateerth&quot;. It boasts a rich history, which has given it various other names, including Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan and Kollpur, all meaning &quot;valley&quot; Around 2 CE Kolhapur&#x27;s name was &#x27;Kuntal&#x27;.

Kolhapur is known as &quot;&#x27;Dakshin Kashi&quot;&#x27; or Kashi of the South because of its spiritual history and the antiquity of its shrine Mahalaxmi, better known as Ambabai. The region is known for the production of the famous handcrafted and braided leather slippers called Kolhapuri chappal, which received the Geographical Indication designation in 2019. In Hindu mythology, the city is referred to as &quot;&quot;Karvir&quot;.&quot;

Before India became independent in 1947, Kolhapur was a princely state under the Bhosale Chhatrapati of the Maratha Confederacy. It is an important centre for the Marathi film industry.

==Etymology==
Kolhapur is named after Kolhasur, a demon in Hindu History. According to legend, the demon Kolhasur renounced asceticism after his sons were killed by the gods for harassing people. He prayed to Mahalakshmi, requesting that she leave the area to him for a hundred years. He committed numerous crimes during this period until the goddess returned after the hundred years were over and killed him for his sins. Kolhasur&#x27;s dying wish was to name the place after him, a request granted, and the area was named Kolhapur. &#x27;Kolha&#x27; represents Kolhasur, and &#x27;pur,&#x27; a Sanskrit word, means &#x27;city.&#x27;

Stone inscriptions from the Shilahar kingdom, which ruled this region from 8–12 C.A.D., mention this area as &#x27;kshullakpur&#x27; (the first stage of Jain monkhood) and &#x27;Kalapuri,&#x27; a city with beautifully carved temples. This historical information is preserved in Shilahar-era ancient Jain matha and temples near the Ambabai temple.

==History==
===Mediaeval era===
The Shilahara family founded a dynasty at Kolhapur about the time of the downfall of the Rashtrakuta Empire, that ruled over southern Maharashtra including the modern districts of Satara, Kolhapur and Belagavi (Karnataka). Their family deity was the goddess Ambabai, whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (&quot;Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada&quot;). Like their relatives of the northern branch of Konkan, the Shilaharas of Kolhapur claimed to be of the lineage of Vidyadhara Jimutavahana, a Jain scholar. Their banner featured a golden Garuda. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was &quot;Tagarapuravaradhisvara&quot;, supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara.
The first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at Karad during the reign of Jatiga II, as known from their copper plate grant of Miraj and &#x27;Vikramankadevacharita&#x27; of Bilhana. Hence, they are referred to sometimes as the &#x27;Shilaharas of Karad&#x27;. Later, although the capital was shifted to Kolhapur, some of their grants mention Valavada and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala (Panhala) as the places of royal residence. Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power in the latter part of the Rashtrakuta rule and unlike the kings of the other two branches, this branch does not allude to the genealogy of the Rashtrakutas even in their early grants. They acknowledged the suzerainty of the later Chalukya dynasty for some time. They had used Kannada as an official language as can be seen from their inscriptions. The branch held southern Maharashtra from circa 940 to 1220.
From 940 to 1212 CE, Kolhapur was the centre of power of the Shilahara dynasty. An inscription at Terdal states that the king Gonka (1020 – 1050 CE) was bitten by a snake then healed by a Jain monk. Gonka then built a temple to Lord Neminath, the twenty-second Jain tirthankara (enlightened being). From this era, Jain temples in and around Kolhapur are called &quot;Gonka-Jinalaya&quot;.

Around 1055 CE, during the reign of Bhoja I (Shilahara dynasty), a dynamic Acharya (spiritual guide) named Maghanandi (Kolapuriya) founded a religious institute at the Rupanarayana Jain temple (basadi). Maghanandi is also known as &quot;Siddhanta-Chakravarti&quot;, meaning &quot;the great master of the scriptures&quot;. Kings and nobles of the Shilahara dynasty such as Gandaraditya I, who succeeded Bhoja I, were disciples of Maghanandi.

Kolhapur was the site of intense confrontation between the Western Chalukya Empire and Rajadhiraja Chola and his younger brother Rajendra Chola II of the Chola empire. In 1052 CE, following the Battle of Koppam, the victor, Rajendra Chola II, marched on to Kolhapur and erected a &quot;jayastambha&quot; (victory pillar).

Between 1109 and 1178 CE, the Kopeshwar temple to Lord Shiva was built by Shilahara kings, Gandaraditya I, Vijayaditya, and Bhoja II in Khidrapur, Kolhapur.

===Kolhapur State===
The state of Kolhapur was established by Tarabai in 1707 in the midst of a succession dispute over the Maratha crown. The Maratha throne was then occupied by descendants of Tarabai. One of the prominent Kings was Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj. In his reign, he promoted free education to people of all castes, religions and fought against untouchability. The state was annexed by the British in the 19th century. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged with Bombay State on 1 March 1949. Kolhapur is sometimes found spelled as &quot;Colapore&quot;. Often, Kolhapur is also referred as &quot;Dakshin Kashi&quot; or the Kashi of the South, due to its rich religious history.

===Scriptural references===
Kolhapur is mentioned in the &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, the final chapter of the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, a text of Shaktism. Kolhapur is noted as a place of &quot;Kollamma&quot; worship. In the text, Devi says,
:&quot;O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My Bhaktas. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named &quot;Kollapura&quot; in the southern country. Here the Devi Ambabai always dwells.&quot;

<doc id="337539" wikidata="Q3268400" url="?curid=337539" title="Babushka Lady">
<text>The Babushka Lady is an unidentified woman present during the 1963 assassination of US President John F. Kennedy who might have photographed or filmed the events that occurred in Dallas’ Dealey Plaza at the time President Kennedy was shot. Her nickname arose from the US Army headscarf she wore, which was similar to scarves worn by elderly Russian women. &quot;Babushka&quot; () literally means &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman&quot; in Russian.

The Babushka Lady was seen to be holding a camera by eyewitnesses and was also seen in film accounts of the assassination. She was observed standing on the grass between Elm and Main streets, standing amongst onlookers in front of the Dallas County Building, and is visible in the Zapruder film, as well as in the films of Orville Nix, Marie Muchmore, and Mark Bell, 44 minutes and 47 seconds into the Bell film; even though the shooting had already taken place and most of her surrounding witnesses took cover, she can be seen still standing with the camera at her face. After the shooting, she crossed Elm Street and joined the crowd that went up the grassy knoll.

The Babushka Lady is last seen in photographs walking east on Elm Street. Neither she, nor the film she may have taken, have ever been positively identified. Her first appearance on film chronologically is on the sidewalk in front of the Dallas County Building, which is visible in an image as being on Kennedy&#x27;s right. She would have crossed Houston Street and onto Dealey Plaza in order to be visible in the Dealey Plaza images. This may imply that the images show two different women of similar appearance. It is plausible that once the motorcade passed by she was able to cross the street to catch a second motorcade drive past on Dealey Plaza where she would be on Kennedy&#x27;s left.

==Beverly Oliver&#x27;s claim==
In 1970, a woman named Beverly Oliver told conspiracy researcher Gary Shaw at a church revival meeting in Joshua, Texas, that she was the Babushka Lady. Oliver stated that she filmed the assassination with a Super 8 film Yashica and that she turned the undeveloped film over to two men who identified themselves to her as FBI agents. According to Oliver, she obtained no receipt from the men, who told her that they would return the film to her within ten days. She did not follow up with an inquiry.

Oliver reiterated her claims in the 1988 documentary &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot;. According to Vincent Bugliosi, Oliver has &quot;never proved to most people&#x27;s satisfaction that she was in Dealey Plaza that day&quot;. Confronted with the fact that the Yashica Super-8 camera was not made until 1969, she stated that she received the &quot;experimental&quot; camera from a friend and was not sure the manufacturer&#x27;s name was on it. Oliver&#x27;s claims were the basis for a scene in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;, in which a character named &quot;Beverly&quot; meets Jim Garrison in a Dallas nightclub. Played by Lolita Davidovich, she is depicted in the director&#x27;s cut as wearing a headscarf at Dealey Plaza and speaking of having given the film she shot to two men claiming to be FBI agents.

==House Select Committee on Assassinations report==
In March 1979, the Photographic Evidence Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations indicated that they were unable to locate any film attributed to the Babushka Lady. According to their report: &quot;Initially, Robert Groden, a photographic consultant to the committee advised the panel as to pertinent photographic issues and related materials. Committee investigators located many of the suggested films and photographs, however, some items were never located, i.e. the Babushka Lady film, a color photograph by Norman Similas, and the original negative of the Betzner photograph.&quot;

==Public hearings of the Assassination Records Review Board==
On November 18, 1994, assassination researcher Gary Mack testified before the Assassination Records Review Board that he had recently been told by an executive in Kodak&#x27;s Dallas office that a woman in her early 30s with brunette hair brought in film purported to be of the assassination scene while they were processing the Zapruder film. According to Mack, the executive said the woman explained to federal investigators already at the film processing office that she ran from Main Street across the grass to Elm Street where she stopped and snapped a photo with some people in the foreground of the presidential limousine and the Texas School Book Depository.

Mack said that he was told by the Kodak executive that the photo was extremely blurry and &quot;virtually useless&quot; and indicated that the woman likely went home without anyone recording her identity. After suggesting that the woman in the story may have been the Babushka Lady, Mack then told the Board: &quot;I do not believe that Beverly Oliver is the Babushka Lady, or, let me rephrase that, she certainly could be but the rest of the story is a fabrication.&quot;

Also appearing that same day before the ARRB as &quot;Beverly Oliver Massegee&quot;, Oliver stated that she was 17 years old at the time of the assassination. She told the Board that she was filming with an &quot;experimental&quot; 8 mm movie camera approximately from Kennedy when he was shot and that the film was confiscated by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent. According to Oliver, she handed over the camera because the man was an authority figure and because she feared being caught in possession of marijuana. Oliver&#x27;s claims were addressed point by point and debunked by conspiracy theory researcher John McAdams.

<text>Nicole, Erica, and Jaclyn Dahm, commonly known as the Dahm triplets (born in that order on December 12, 1977), are identical triplets from Minnesota. The Dahm triplets have appeared on many TV shows and movies and have been in magazines such as &quot;Teen&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. They are best known as being only the second set of triplets to be featured in the US edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;; the first was a set of Brazilian triplets who were featured in November 1993.

== Early lives ==
The triplets grew up in Jordan, Minnesota, and attended Jordan&#x27;s public schools. Originally intending to become nurses, they enrolled at the University of Minnesota after high school. 

== Career ==

=== &quot;Playboy&quot; career ===
They are the Playmates centerfold for the Girls of the Big Ten December 1998 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. According to their &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Nicole and Erica have tiny black ink dots (one and two dots, respectively and Jaclyn has no mark) tattooed onto their buttocks, which their parents used to distinguish the three girls when they were babies. They tried out for &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Girls of the Big Ten&quot; issue on the suggestion of their father.

They are the second set of triplets to be featured in the United States edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;, after &quot;The Trio from Rio, The Amazing Brazilian Triplets&quot; who were featured in the November 1993 issue. The Dahm sisters were featured in several issues of &quot;Playboy&quot;, but appeared on only one cover, that of &quot;Playboy&quot; Australia for June 1999.

=== Television career ===
The trio appeared on the show &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in 1999. The trio was also on the Fox reality show &quot;Renovate My Family&quot;, where Jay McGraw was the host. All three appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; with their older sister Lisa, and father Bob. Along with their father and an assigned interior decorator, they also competed in and won the reality competition show &quot;House Wars&quot;; their prize for winning was to keep the house which they had renovated.

The triplets more recently appeared as regular members of the mob on the final weeks of NBC&#x27;s game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;. The triplets played as one mob member.

The triplets have appeared on episodes of &quot;The Doctors&quot;, where Jay McGraw is a producer, discussing a variety of topics, principally around their pregnancies, which all happened about the same time. 
=== Internet career ===

The triplets had their own website, www.dahmgirls.com, which was active until late 2004. The members&#x27; area of the site featured photo galleries similar to those produced by &quot;Playboy&quot;. Toward the end of 2004, that site was replaced with www.jenx3.com (j, e, and n being their initials), which remained active only briefly and contained no nude pictorials. Both sites are no longer online. Other appearances on the internet include a pictorial in the Playboy Cyber Club&#x27;s celebrity photographer feature, shot by NASCAR racer Dale Earnhardt Jr.

The Dahm Triplets started their own cooking website called &quot;Triplets Gourmet&quot;, which is no longer functioning. In addition, the triplets have opened up an account on YouTube also called &quot;TripletsGourmet.&quot; Their first video is their collection of recipes and the usefulness of freezing gourmet food. Only one video was made and posted, in 2008.

== Personal lives ==
Erica married Jay McGraw, a son of Phil McGraw from the &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; television program. She gave birth to a daughter on March 18, 2010, and a son on August 31, 2011.

<text>Information foraging is a theory that applies the ideas from optimal foraging theory to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use &quot;built-in&quot; foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food. Importantly, a better understanding of human search behavior can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface.

==History of the theory==

In the 1970s optimal foraging theory was developed by anthropologists and ecologists to explain how animals hunt for food. It suggested that the eating habits of animals revolve around maximizing energy intake over a given amount of time. For every predator, certain prey is worth pursuing, while others would result in a net loss of energy.

In the early 1990s, Peter Pirolli and Stuart Card from PARC noticed the similarities between users&#x27; information searching patterns and animal food foraging strategies. Working together with psychologists to analyze users&#x27; actions and the information landscape that they navigated (links, descriptions, and other data), they showed that information seekers use the same strategies as food foragers.

In the late 1990s, Ed H. Chi worked with Pirolli, Card, and others at PARC to further develop information scent ideas and algorithms to actually use these concepts in real interactive systems, including the modeling of web user browsing behavior, the inference of information needs from web visit log files, and the use of information scent concepts in reading and browsing interfaces.

==Details of the theory==

&quot;Informavores&quot; constantly make decisions on what kind of information to look for, whether to stay at the current site to try to find additional information or whether they should move on to another site, which path or link to follow to the next information site, and when to finally stop the search. Although human cognition is not a result of evolutionary pressure to improve Web use, survival-related traits to respond quickly on partial information and reduce energy expenditures force them to optimize their searching behavior and, simultaneously, to minimize the thinking required.

===Information scent===
The most important concept in the information foraging theory is &quot;information scent&quot;. As animals rely on scents to indicate the chances of finding prey in current area and guide them to other promising patches, so do humans rely on various cues in the information environment to get similar answers. Human users estimate how much useful information they are likely to get on a given path, and after seeking information compare the actual outcome with their predictions. When the information scent stops getting stronger (i.e., when users no longer expect to find useful additional information), the users move to a different information source.

===Information diet===
Some tendencies in the behaviour of web users are easily understood from the information foraging theory standpoint. On the Web, each site is a patch and information is the prey. Leaving a site is easy, but finding good sites has not always been as easy. Advanced search engines have changed this fact by reliably providing relevant links, altering the foraging strategies of the users. When users expect that sites with lots of information are easy to find, they have less incentive to stay in one place. The growing availability of broadband connections may have a similar effect: always-on connections encourage this behavior, short online visits to get specific answers.

===Models===
Attempts have been made to develop computational cognitive models to characterize information foraging behavior on the Web. 
These models assume that users perceive relevance of information based on some measures of information scent, which are usually derived based on statistical techniques that extract semantic relatedness of words from large text databases. Recently these information foraging models have been extended to explain social information behavior. See also models of collaborative tagging.

<text>Norsk Hydro ASA (often referred to as just &quot;Hydro&quot;) is a Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy company, headquartered in Oslo. It is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide. It has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents. The Norwegian state owns 34.3% of the company through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. A further 6.5% is owned by Folketrygdfond, which administers the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Norsk Hydro employs approximately 35,000 people. Eivind Kallevik has been the CEO since May, 2024, following Hilde Merete Aasheim. Rune Bjerke has been the Chairman since 2024 and Magnus Aakvaag (the grandson of former CEO Torvild Aakvaag) serves as a strategic advisor. 

Hydro had a significant presence in the oil and gas industry until October 2007, when these operations were merged with Statoil to form StatoilHydro (in 2009 changed back to Statoil, which is now called Equinor).

==History==
===First steps with fertiliser===
Financed by the Swedish Wallenberg family and French banks, the company was founded on December 2, 1905 as Norsk hydro-elektrisk (lit. Norwegian hydro-electric nitrogen limited) by Sam Eyde, exploiting a novel technology for producing artificial fertilizers by fixing nitrogen from air. The technology had been developed by the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. The method is still known as the Birkeland–Eyde process. The process required large amounts of electric energy, and for this, a power plant was built at the Svelgfossen waterfall near Notodden. Later also Rjukan Falls was developed and its power harnessed, in the process establishing the city of Rjukan, establishing the plant Norsk Hydro Rjukan.

Hydro&#x27;s first factory was built at Notodden (opened in 1907) followed up with another at Rjukan, Tinn (opened in 1911). Then in 1920 production was established at Glomfjord in Nordland. In 1930 Norsk Hydro opened a plant at Herøya outside Porsgrunn. To begin with it was to function as a shipping port for the fertilizer as well as a point to import limestone. From 1936 Hydro also started producing fertilizer at Herøya. There was also opened a railway, Rjukanbanen, connecting Rjukan with Hærøy. The railway opened in 1909 and consisted of a railway ferry across Lake Tinn, railway again with the Tinnoset Line and a barge ride from Borgestad to Herøya with barge on the Telemark Canal. The canal was superseded by the Bratsberg Line in 1916.

By the 1920s, Norsk Hydro&#x27;s electric arc-based technology for manufacturing artificial fertilizer was no longer able to compete with the newly developed Haber-Bosch process, and in 1927 the company formed a partnership with the German company IG Farben in order to gain access to this process. By 1945, IG Farben had become a majority shareholder in Norsk Hydro. The plant at Herøya was a direct result of no longer being dependent on immediate proximity to the power sources. This provided the advantage of being able to have the plants and the shipping port in the same location, as was the case with the Herøya plant.

===Heavy water production at Rjukan===
The Rjukan plant was the only location in Europe which produced heavy water, a component the Allied powers in World War II feared would be used as part of the German atomic bomb project. At the time, German industrial conglomerate I.G. Farben owned stock in Norsk Hydro, which then produced less than of heavy water per month, and the company was approached to increase its deuterium output to at least per month. Although Norsk Hydro&#x27;s management had previously refused to supply the heavy water, upon Norway&#x27;s surrender to Nazi Germany, the company gave up its resistance and agreed to supply 1.5 tons of heavy water per year.

Consequently, Norsk Hydro&#x27;s facilities were the target of several commando and air raids and a sabotage raid which eventually resulted in the plant&#x27;s destruction and later reconstruction.

===First metal production===

The first steps towards light metal production came in 1940 when Hydro started construction of a magnesium carbonate plant at Herøya, but the German invasion of Norway stopped the plans.

In 1941 the Oslo Consortium (Norwegian: Oslo-konsortiet) invested money equivalent to year 2014 Norwegian kroner 172 million. (The consortium included Thomas Fearnley, Orkla, Fred Olsen, Storebrand, Jens P. Heyerdahl, Klaveness &amp; Co, Christopher Kahrs Kielland.) Collaboration with the Nazi-German regime, did not result in any company employees being convicted (for collaboration) after the war.

During the Second World War Norsk Hydro collaborated with IG Farben and &quot;Nordische Aluminium Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (Nordag) in building new aluminium and magnesium plants in support of the German war effort. The construction was however ended on July 24, 1943 when an allied bombardment completely destroyed the facilities, killing 55 construction workers. As Germany&#x27;s defeat became more likely, Norsk Hydro started to tone down its collaborative relations with the occupier.

In 1946 the Årdal aluminium plant was opened, operated by the state owned company Årdal og Sunndal Verk. In a merger, Hydro acquired this company in 1986, in essence establishing the light metal division Hydro Aluminium.

Since 1919, there had been zinc production and then aluminium production at Glomfjord in Northern Norway. Hydro bought the power plant in 1947 and started ammonia production there instead. In the 1950s Hydro opened a new magnesium plant in Herøya and in 1963 Hydro started in cooperation with Harvey Aluminum, building a plant at Karmøy to produce aluminium. The plant, called Alnor, was purchased in whole by Hydro in 1973.

In 2000, Hydro acquired Wells Aluminum, a network of aluminium extrusion plants in the United States. Two years later, the company acquired the leading German aluminium producer &quot;Vereinigte Aluminium Werke&quot; from the German utility company E.ON and the French building systems company Technal.

Hydro became a truly integrated aluminium company in 2011, when it acquired the aluminium assets owned by Vale in Brazil for $4.9 billion. This gave Hydro the world&#x27;s largest alumina refinery and aimed to &quot;secure raw materials for more than a hundred years of aluminum production&quot;. Hydro gained a large bauxite supply, including control of the Paragominas mine, one of the largest bauxite mines in the world. It also gained large alumina refining and aluminum production capacity, including a 51 percent stake in the Albras aluminum plant and 91 percent ownership of Alunorte, then the world&#x27;s largest alumina refinery and now the largest outside China.

===Into the petroleum age===

In 1965, Hydro joined Elf Aquitaine and six other French companies to form Petronord to perform search for oil and gas in the North Sea. Hydro soon became a large company in the North Sea petroleum industry, and also became operator of a number of fields, the first being Oseberg.

In 1969, Hydro started its first international operations, with a 25% stake in a fertilizer plant in Qatar.

Hydro acquired in the late 1980s the Mobil service stations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, changing their name to Hydro. In 1995 Hydro merged its gas stations in Norway and Denmark with the Texaco, creating the joint venture HydroTexaco. The service station chain was sold in 2006 to Reitangruppen. In 1999 Hydro acquired Norway&#x27;s third largest petroleum company Saga Petroleum, which had major upstream operations primarily in Norway and the United Kingdom. The British operations were later sold.

Hydro&#x27;s fertilizer business was spun off as a separately stock-listed company under the name of Yara International on March 26, 2004. Hydro distributed all its Yara shares to Hydro&#x27;s shareholders and presently has no ownership in Yara.

In December 2006 Norsk Hydro revealed a proposal to merge their oil business with compatriate oil and gas company Statoil. Under the rules of the EEA the proposal was approved by the European Union on May 3, 2007 and by the Norwegian Parliament on June 8, 2007. The merger was completed by 1 October 2007. Hydro&#x27;s shareholders took 32.7% of the new company—StatoilHydro—shares.

== Controversies ==
In recent years, Norsk Hydro has faced criticism for continuing operations in Russia despite international sanctions and geopolitical tensions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to the Leave Russia project, the company maintains a presence in Russia, which has sparked concerns over its compliance with ethical business practices and its stance on human rights issues.

==Operations==
===Aluminium===
Hydro is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide. In Norway, Hydro has plants in Magnor, Rjukan, Raufoss, Vennesla, Karmøy, Høyanger, Årdal, Husnes, Sunndalsøra, and Holmestrand. Most of the employees in the company work in plants and offices located outside Norway, such as Hungary, Germany and Brazil. Hydro has more employees in the United States than any other Norwegian company.

In 2010, Hydro and QatarEnergy inaugurated their 50-50 joint venture Qatalum, located in Qatar. It was the largest aluminium plant ever launched in one step. Its annual capacity in September 2011 was 585,000 metric tons of primary aluminium, all to be shipped as value added aluminium casthouse products. A 1350 MW natural gas power plant was also built to ensure a stable supply of electricity.

In 2010, Hydro acquired the Brazilian bauxite, alumina and aluminium production assets of Vale, an international mining and metals company.

In September 2013, Hydro combined its aluminium extrusion operations with that of Sapa, making Sapa a 50/50 joint venture between Hydro and the Norwegian company Orkla. Hydro 
then acquired Orkla&#x27;s 50% ownership in Sapa in October 2017, taking over the company and turning it into a new business area within Hydro, called Extruded Solutions. The agreed enterprise value for 100% of Sapa was NOK 27 billion.

===Energy===
Hydro is a major producer of hydroelectric power in Norway.

To secure electricity for its aluminium production Hydro has signed a power purchase agreement with the Fosen Vind wind farm, which is scheduled to be fully operational in 2020. Under this agreement Fosen Vind will deliver around 0.6 TWh in 2020, around 1.0 TWh annually from 2021 to 2035 and 0.7 TWh annually from 2036 to 2039, for a total of about 18 TWh over a 20-year period.

===Hydro Agri===
Though Hydro started off as a fertilizer producer and agricultural products was for a long time one of the companies major ventures, the agricultural division was in 2004 demerged into the independent company Yara International, listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

=== Hydro Global Business Services ===
Hydro Global Business Services was founded In 2020 to deliver Finance, IT, and HR services to all businesses within the Hydro company. The largest hub is in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. 

== Environmental issues ==
In February 2018 Hydro was forced to cut aluminium production by 50% in its plant located in Pará, Brazil (operated by the joint venture Albras). This followed allegations that untreated and contaminated water had been released to the environment, resulting in water pollution. A team of local researchers found a clandestine waste pipe and highly elevated levels of aluminum in its proximity. Other substances such as nitrate, sulphate, chloride and lead were also found at abnormally high concentrations. Hydro has since claimed that while some unauthorized spills had happened, their own and independent reports showed no environmental pollution of the river but only a small change in pH.

<text>Bayswater () is a London Underground station in the Bayswater area of the City of Westminster. The station is on the Circle and District lines, between Notting Hill Gate and Paddington stations and is in Travelcard Zone 1. It is less than away from the Central line&#x27;s Queensway station.

==Location==
The station is located on the busy Queensway tourist street and is only a few metres from Bayswater Road. It is a short walk from Portobello Market. Further north along the street is the site of the former Whiteleys shopping centre, which is currently under redevelopment. Also nearby is Westbourne Grove, Queens ice rink and bowling centre, Kensington Gardens and St Sophia&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral. It is less than away from Queensway station on the Central line.

==History==
The station was opened by the steam-operated Metropolitan Railway (MR) (now the Metropolitan line) on 1 October 1868 as Bayswater, as part of the railway&#x27;s southern extension to South Kensington where it connected to the District Railway (DR). Construction of the railway line, through the already developed Bayswater area required the excavation of a tunnel using the cut and cover method: a trench deep was excavated between brick retaining walls which was then roofed-over with brick arches to allow building work above. Large compensation payments were made to landowners affected by the excavations and, in Leinster Gardens to the east, the frontages of two houses demolished to make way for the line were reconstructed to restore the appearance of a terrace of houses.
The platforms of Bayswater station were constructed in the trench and provided with a glazed roof. A short section of the trench was left unroofed to the west of the station to allow smoke and steam from the trains to escape from the tunnels. Even before the completion in 1884 of the continuous circuit of tracks which are now the Circle line, the MR and DR operated services through Bayswater as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;. The MR originally provided all of the trains, but from 1871, each company operated half of the service.

In 1905, to improve the conditions in the tunnels and stations and increase service frequencies, the MR electrified the tracks through Bayswater and, in conjunction with the DR, around the whole of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; and across most of their routes. Electric trains began running on 1 July 1905, but the MR&#x27;s poor coordination of the installation work with the DR led to disruption for several months.
On 1 November 1926, the District line began a service between Edgware Road and Putney Bridge and the station was also renamed to Bayswater (Queen&#x27;s Road) &amp; Westbourne Grove. From this date the MR operated all &quot;Inner Circle&quot; services apart from a few District line operated Sunday services. The station was then renamed again to Bayswater (Queen&#x27;s Road) in 1933. In 1946, it was renamed to Bayswater (Queensway) but the suffix was gradually dropped. In 1949, the service was separately identified on the tube map as the Circle line for the first time.

The station was refurbished by Metronet in 2006.

==Services and connections==

===Services===
====Circle line====
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph clockwise to Edgware Road via Paddington (Praed Street)
*6tph anti-clockwise to Hammersmith via High Street Kensington and Victoria

====District line====
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph eastbound to Edgware Road
*6tph westbound to Wimbledon

There is also a morning service every day from Acton Town (Ealing Broadway on Saturdays) to Edgware Road and a late evening service from Edgware Road to Ealing Broadway on Sundays only.

===Connections===
London Bus day, night and 24-hour bus routes serve the station.

==Incidents==
In November 2017, a 29-year-old man attempted to murder a 55-year-old man by pushing him in front of a District line train as it was pulling in to the platform. However, the victim survived by adopting a foetal position between the rails as the train passed over him.

==In popular culture==
Bayswater tube station is the subject of a painting by Walter Sickert dating from 1916, showing the platform-sign reading &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Road (Bayswater)&#x27; beside a big advertisement for Whiteley&#x27;s department store. The station was later renamed Bayswater, to avoid confusion with Queensway station, which was also named &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Road&#x27; until 1946.

<doc id="337566" wikidata="Q1340700" url="?curid=337566" title="Long-term effects of alcohol">
<text>The long-term effects of alcohol have been extensively researched. The health effects of long-term alcohol consumption vary depending on the amount consumed. Even light drinking poses health risks, but atypically small amounts of alcohol may have health benefits. Alcoholism causes severe health consequences which outweigh any potential benefits.

Long-term alcohol consumption is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body. Risks include malnutrition, cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, gastritis, stomach ulcers, alcoholic liver disease, certain types of dementia, and several types of cancer, including oropharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and female breast cancers. In addition, damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (e.g., painful peripheral neuropathy) can occur from chronic heavy alcohol consumption. There is also an increased risk for accidental injuries, for example, those sustained in traffic accidents and falls. Excessive alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on aging. 

Conversely, light intake of alcohol may have some beneficial effects. The association of alcohol intake with reduced cardiovascular risk has been noted since 1904 and remains even after adjusting for known confounders. Light alcohol intake is also associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, gastritis, and cholelithiasis. However, these are only observational studies and high-quality evidence for the beneficial effects of alcohol is nonexistent. 

The developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the developing fetal brain is also vulnerable, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) may result if pregnant mothers consume alcohol. Some nations have introduced alcohol packaging warning messages that inform consumers about alcohol and cancer, and about risk of fetal alcohol syndrome for women who drink while pregnant.

Alcohol does have psychosocial benefits such as stress reduction, mood elevation, increased sociability, and relaxation, but it is unclear if these outweigh the confirmed increase in the risk of cancer.

==Overall effect==

The level of ethanol consumption that minimizes the risk of disease, injury, and death is subject to some controversy. Several studies have found a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and health, meaning that risk is minimized at a certain (non-zero) consumption level, and drinking below or above this level increases risk, with the risk level of drinking a large amount of alcohol greater than the risk level of abstinence. Other studies have found a dose-response relationship, with lifetime abstention from alcohol being the optimal strategy and more consumption incurring more risk. The studies use different data sets and statistical techniques so cannot be directly compared. Some older studies included former and occasional drinkers in the &quot;abstainers&quot; category, which obscures the benefits of lifetime abstention as former drinkers often are in poor health. However, the J-curve was reconfirmed by studies that took the mentioned confounders into account. Nonetheless, some authors remain suspicious that the apparent health benefits of light alcohol use are in large part due to various selection biases and competing risks. Mendelian randomization studies have been inconsistent regarding the risk curve, with three studies finding linear dose-response risks overall and two studies finding a J-shape for lipid profiles. The variance in alcohol consumption that is explained by genetics is small, requiring large sample sizes and potentially violating assumptions of the analysis.

As one reviewer noted, &quot;Despite the wealth of observational data, it is not absolutely clear that alcohol reduces risk, because no randomized controlled trials have been performed.&quot; The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) announced a randomized controlled trial in 2017, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) cancelled it in 2018 due to irregular interactions by the program staff with the alcohol industry. A trial in Spain is expected to complete in 2028. 

In 2013, Norwegian psychiatrist Hans Olav Fekjær compared the situation to those of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), vitamin E, and β-carotene; similarly to alcohol, observational studies for each of these treatments showed significantly reduced risk of coronary heart disease, but initial randomized trials of these treatments failed to replicate the effect. For HRT, pooling multiple randomized control trials and stratifying the data by age and time since menopause showed the benefits were limited to treatment soon after menopause. For vitamin E, trials have shown that the benefits are limited to certain populations such as those with diabetes and a specific genotype. For β-carotene, the randomized trials have shown that β-carotene increases cardiovascular disease risk when supplemented, with all beneficial effects due to other vitamins in foods providing β-carotene.

In light of the conflicting evidence, many have cautioned against recommendations for the use of alcohol for health benefits. At a symposium in 1997, Dr. Peter Anderson of the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled such alcohol promotion as &quot;ridiculous and dangerous&quot;. It has been argued that the health benefits from alcohol have been exaggerated by the alcohol industry, with industry participation in the wording of messages and warnings. The debate is not purely scientific, with groups such as the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research (ISFAR) critiquing anti-alcohol studies as distorting the evidence, scientists in turn accusing these groups of bias due to industry funding, and members of the groups responding that these are false and misleading assertions. Studies with industry funding find less risk of stroke, and industry-linked systematic reviews consistently find cardioprotective effects, compared to reviews with no associations being 54% positive.

Considered as a treatment for cardiovascular disease, alcohol is addictive, has greater risk of adverse effects, and is less effective than other interventions such as heart medications, exercise, or good nutrition. 

=== The world ===
The available evidence is in agreement that current drinking levels are too high. The WHO has emphasized the need to revise alcohol control policies worldwide in order to reduce overall alcohol consumption.

Globally, assuming the J-shaped curve is correct, the age-standardised, both-sexes consumption that minimizes risk is about 5 grams of ethanol per day, and an average individual would cause themselves harm by drinking more than 17 grams per day. However, the average intake among current drinkers in 2016 was approximately 40 grams of ethanol per day. 1.03 billion males (35.1% of the male population aged ≥15 years, ~2/3 of male drinkers) and 312 million females (10.5% of the female population aged ≥15 years, ~1/3 of female drinkers) consumed harmful amounts of alcohol. The proportion of the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol has stayed at approximately the same level over the past three decades.

Estimates of the worldwide number of deaths per year caused by alcohol vary. The 2016 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated 2.8 million, while the 2020 GBD study estimated 1.78 million. The WHO estimates 3 million deaths per year from harmful use of alcohol, representing 5.3% of all deaths across the globe. All of these numbers are net deaths, subtracting deaths prevented from deaths caused. Professor Tim Stockwell, former director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research argues that alcohol may not prevent any deaths and guesses that as many as 6 million deaths may be caused by alcohol. Besides this, the WHO attributes 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury to alcohol, as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The WHO does not list alcohol in its 2019 list of the top 20 leading causes of DALYs, but alcohol use disorder (AUD) would rank around #39, combining AUD with alcohol-related cirrhosis and liver cancer would rank between malaria (#19) and refractive errors (#20), and all alcohol-attributed DALYs would rank between stroke (#3) and lower respiratory infections (#4). Similarly the number of alcohol-attributed deaths would rank between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (#3) and lower respiratory infections (#4).

Research of Western cultures has consistently shown increased survival associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption. Australasia and Europe are also the locations with the highest levels of harmful alcohol consumption. Researchers have investigated cultures with different alcohol consumption norms and found conflicting results.

The risks of alcohol consumption are age-dependent. Risk is greatest among males aged 15–39 years, due to binge drinking which may result in violence or traffic accidents. It is less risky and potentially more beneficial for an older individual to consume a given amount of alcohol, compared to a similar younger individual, as they are less likely to develop cancer during their remaining lifespan, less likely to be involved in accidents, and more likely to benefit from alcohol&#x27;s cardiovascular effects. Taking the lower bound of the confidence intervals, the GBD 2020 study suggests that people do not need to drink until age 25, and in many regions, the study did not find any significant benefit for drinking over abstinence even as late as ages 45 or 60. Other studies have found similar patterns.

===India=== 
A study of 4,465 subjects in India confirmed the association of alcohol consumption with coronary risk in men. Compared to lifetime abstainers, alcohol users had higher blood sugar (2 mg/dl), blood pressure (2 mm Hg) levels, and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (2 mg/dl) and significantly higher tobacco use (63% vs. 21%). Indians who consume alcohol had a 60% higher risk of heart attack, which was greater with local spirits (80%) than branded spirits (50%). The harm was observed in alcohol users classified as occasional as well as regular light, moderate, and heavy consumers. Five percent of all cancers diagnosed in Indians in 2021 were attributed to alcohol consumption, with cancers of the esophagus, liver, and breast accounting for the most number of cases.

===Russia===

As of 2014, male life expectancy was lower in Russia than other countries. For example, at 2005 mortality rates, only 7% of UK men but 37% of Russian men would die before the age of 55 years. A study by Zaridze et al. in 2009 found that &quot;excessive alcohol consumption in Russia, particularly by men, has in recent years caused more than half of all the deaths at ages 15–54 years.&quot; The study used 43,802 deaths linked to alcohol or tobacco but only 5475 other deaths as controls. Further studies have confirmed that heavy drinking and smoking are the main cause of high death rates in Russia as of 2014. The high consumption of vodka in the context of binge drinking is a significant factor. For smokers aged 35-54, the 20-year risk of death was 35% for men who had reported drinking three or more bottles of vodka a week and 16% for men who had reported consuming less than one bottle a week.

===South Asia===
The landmark INTERHEART Study has revealed that alcohol consumption in South Asians was not protective against CAD in sharp contrast to other populations who benefit from it.

===United Kingdom===
A governmental report from Britain has found that &quot;There were 8,724 alcohol-related deaths in 2007, lower than 2006, but more than double the 4,144 recorded in 1991. The alcohol-related death rate was 13.3 per 100,000 population in 2007, compared with 6.9 per 100,000 population in 1991.&quot; In Scotland, the NHS estimate that in 2003 one in every 20 deaths could be attributed to alcohol. A 2009 report noted that the death rate from alcohol-related disease was 9,000, a number three times that of 25 years previously.

A UK report came to the result that the effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption on mortality are age-dependent. Low-to-moderate alcohol use increases the risk of death for individuals aged 16–34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but decreases the risk of death for individuals ages 55+ (due to decreased risk of ischemic heart disease).

A study in the United Kingdom found that alcohol causes about 4% of cancer cases in the UK (12,500 cases per year).

===United States===

Excessive alcohol use was the 3rd leading behavioral cause of death for people in the United States in the year 2000. In 2001, an estimated 75,766 deaths were attributable to alcohol. From 2006 through 2010, there were approximately 87,798 deaths on average attributable to alcohol occurred in the United States each year. Alcohol-related deaths among Americans about doubled from 1999 to 2020. In 2020, alcohol was linked to nearly 50,000 deaths among adults aged 25 to 85, a sharp rise from just under 20,000 in 1999. All age groups experienced increases, with the most significant rise occurring in individuals aged 25 to 34, where death rates nearly quadrupled during this period. In 2025, the US Surgeon General advocated for cancer risk warnings on alcoholic beverages.

==Cardiovascular system==

Alcohol has been found to have anticoagulant properties. Thrombosis is lower among moderate drinkers than abstainers. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that alcohol consumption in moderation decreases serum levels of fibrinogen, a protein that promotes clot formation, while it increases levels of tissue type plasminogen activator, an enzyme that helps dissolve clots. These changes were estimated to reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 24%. Another meta-analysis in 2011 found favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, and fibrinogen associated with moderate alcohol consumption. A systematic review based on 16,351 participants showed J-shaped curve for the overall relationship between cardiovascular mortality and alcohol intake. Maximal protective effect was shown with 5–10 g of alcohol consumption per day and the effect was significant up to 26 g/day alcohol consumption. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a putative marker of inflammation and predictor of CHD (coronary heart disease) risk, are lower in moderate drinkers than in those who abstain from alcohol, suggesting that alcohol consumption in moderation might have anti-inflammatory effects. Data from one prospective study suggest that, among men with initially low alcohol consumption (&lt;/=1 drink per week), a subsequent moderate increase in alcohol consumption may lower their CVD risk.

===Peripheral arterial disease===
A prospective study published in 1997 found &quot;moderate alcohol consumption appears to decrease the risk of PAD in apparently healthy men.&quot; In a large population-based study, moderate alcohol consumption was inversely associated with peripheral arterial disease in women but not in men. But when confounding by smoking was considered, the benefit extended to men. The study concluded &quot;an inverse association between alcohol consumption and peripheral arterial disease was found in nonsmoking men and women.&quot;

===Intermittent claudication===
A study found that moderate consumption of alcohol had a protective effect against intermittent claudication. The lowest risk was seen in men who drank 1 to 2 drinks per day and in women who drank half to 1 drink per day.

===Heart attack and stroke===
Drinking in moderation has been found to help those who have had a heart attack survive it. However, excessive alcohol consumption leads to an increased risk of heart failure. At present there have been no randomised trials to confirm the evidence which suggests a protective role of low doses of alcohol against heart attacks. There is an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke if three or more standard drinks of alcohol are taken per day. A systematic review reported that reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner in heavy drinkers. There is no safe amount of alcohol without having a negative effect on blood pressure. Even individuals who consume only one drink per day show a link to higher blood pressure.

Frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages is a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides.

===Cardiomyopathy===
Large amounts of alcohol over the long term can lead to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents in a manner clinically identical to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, involving hypertrophy of the musculature of the heart that can lead to congestive heart failure.

===Hematologic diseases===
Alcoholics may have anemia from several causes; they may also develop thrombocytopenia from direct toxic effect on megakaryocytes, or from hypersplenism.

===Atrial fibrillation===
Alcohol consumption increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. This remains true even at moderate levels of consumption.

==Nervous system==
Chronic heavy alcohol consumption impairs brain development, causes alcohol dementia, brain shrinkage, physical dependence, alcoholic polyneuropathy (also known as &#x27;alcohol leg&#x27;), increases neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders and causes distortion of the brain chemistry. At present, due to poor study design and methodology, the literature is inconclusive on whether moderate alcohol consumption increases the risk of dementia or decreases it. Evidence for a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on age-related cognitive decline and dementia has been suggested by some research; however, other research has not found a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption. Some evidence suggests that low to moderate alcohol consumption may speed up brain volume loss. Chronic consumption of alcohol may result in increased plasma levels of the toxic amino acid homocysteine; which may explain alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcohol-induced brain atrophy and alcohol-related cognitive disturbances. Alcohol&#x27;s impact on the nervous system can also include disruptions of memory and learning (&quot;see Effects of alcohol on memory&quot;), such as resulting in a blackout phenomenon.

===Strokes===
Epidemiological studies of middle-aged populations generally find the relationship between alcohol intake and the risk of stroke to be either U- or J-shaped. There may be very different effects of alcohol based on the type of stroke studied. The predominant form of stroke in Western cultures is ischemic, whereas non-western cultures have more hemorrhagic stroke. In contrast to the beneficial effect of alcohol on ischemic stroke, consumption of more than two drinks per day increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The National Stroke Association estimates this higher amount of alcohol increases stroke risk by 50%. &quot;For stroke, the observed relationship between alcohol consumption and risk in a given population depends on the proportion of strokes that are hemorrhagic. Light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke which is likely to be, in part, causal. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, displays a log-linear relationship with alcohol intake.&quot;

===Brain===
Alcohol misuse is associated with widespread and significant brain lesions. Alcohol related brain damage is not only due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol; alcohol withdrawal, nutritional deficiency, electrolyte disturbances, and liver damage are also believed to contribute to alcohol-related brain damage.

Alcohol can cause brain damage, Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy and Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome which frequently occur simultaneously, known as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Lesions, or brain abnormalities, are typically located in the diencephalon which result in anterograde and retrograde amnesia, or memory loss.

===Cognition and dementia===
Excessive alcohol intake is associated with impaired prospective memory. This impaired cognitive ability leads to increased failure to carry out an intended task at a later date, for example, forgetting to lock the door or to post a letter on time. The higher the volume of alcohol consumed and the longer consumed, the more severe the impairments. One of the organs most sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption is the brain. In the United States approximately 20% of admissions to mental health facilities are related to alcohol-related cognitive impairment, most notably alcohol-related dementia. Chronic excessive alcohol intake is also associated with serious cognitive decline and a range of neuropsychiatric complications. The elderly are the most sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain. There is some inconclusive evidence that small amounts of alcohol taken in earlier adult life is protective in later life against cognitive decline and dementia. However, a study concluded, &quot;Our findings suggest that, despite previous suggestions, moderate alcohol consumption does not protect older people from cognitive decline.&quot;

Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome is a manifestation of thiamine deficiency, usually as a secondary effect of alcohol misuse. The syndrome is a combined manifestation of two eponymous disorders, Korsakoff&#x27;s Psychosis and Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy. Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy is the acute presentation of the syndrome and is characterised by a confusional state while Korsakoff&#x27;s psychosis main symptoms are amnesia and executive dysfunction. &quot;Banana bags&quot;, intravenous fluid containers containing vitamins and minerals (bright yellow due to the vitamins), can be used to mitigate these outcomes.

===Essential tremor===
Essential tremors—or, in the case of essential tremors on a background of family history of essential tremors, familial tremors—can be temporarily relieved in up to two-thirds of patients by drinking small amounts of alcohol.

Ethanol is known to activate aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are both implicated in essential tremor pathology and could underlie the ameliorative effects. Additionally, the effects of ethanol have been studied in different animal essential tremor models. (For more details on this topic, see Essential tremor).

===Sleep===
Chronic use of alcohol used to induce sleep can lead to insomnia: frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and diaphoresis. Stopping chronic alcohol misuse can also lead to profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol misuse is associated with NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.

===Mental health effects===
High rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers. Whether it is more true that major depressive disorder causes self-medicating alcohol use, or the increased incidence of the disorder in people with an alcohol use disorder is caused by the drinking, is not known though some evidence suggests drinking causes the disorder. Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate. A study of people hospitalized for suicide attempts found that those who were alcoholics were 75 times more likely to go on to successfully commit suicide than non-alcoholic suicide attempts. In the general alcoholic population the increased risk of suicide compared to the general public is 5-20 times greater. About 15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide, the most common methods being overdosing and cutting/scratching. There are high rates of suicide attempts, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and self-harm ideation in people with substance dependence who have been hospitalized. Use of other illicit drugs is also associated with an increased risk of suicide. About 33 percent of suicides in the under 35s are correlated with alcohol or other substance misuse.

Social skills are significantly impaired in people that have alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol use disorder include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humor is also impaired in people with an alcohol use disorder.

Studies have shown that alcohol dependence relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (&quot;e.g.&quot; the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other illicit substances. Alcohol misuse has been shown to cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol misuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that excessive alcohol use, via a kindling mechanism, can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.

While alcohol initially helps social phobia or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms and can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect is not unique to alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquilizers to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia have alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will have very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is experiencing the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.

Addiction to alcohol, as with any addictive substance tested so far, has been correlated with an enduring reduction in the expression of GLT1 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens and is implicated in the drug-seeking behavior expressed nearly universally across all documented addiction syndromes. This long-term dysregulation of glutamate transmission is associated with an increase in vulnerability to both relapse-events after re-exposure to drug-use triggers as well as an overall increase in the likelihood of developing addiction to other reinforcing drugs. Drugs which help to re-stabilize the glutamate system such as N-acetylcysteine have been proposed for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol.

The effect on depression and returning to drinking among individuals with alcohol dependence has always been controversial. Studies show that after doing a study on men and women hospitalized for alcohol dependence the likelihood of returning to drinking with depression is extremely high. A diagnosis of major depression at entry into an inpatient treatment for alcohol dependence showed shorter times to first drink and also relapse in both women and men.

==Digestive system and weight gain==

The impact of alcohol on weight-gain is contentious: some studies find no effect, others find decreased or increased effect on weight gain.

Alcohol use increases the risk of chronic gastritis (stomach inflammation); it is one cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis in both its chronic and acute forms.

===Metabolic syndrome===
A national survey (NHANES) conducted in the U.S. concluded, &quot;Mild to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, with a favorable influence on lipids, waist circumference, and fasting insulin. This association was strongest among whites and among beer and wine drinkers.&quot; Similarly, a national survey conducted in Korea reported a J-curve association between alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome: &quot;The results of the present study suggest that the metabolic syndrome is negatively associated with light alcohol consumption (1–15 g alcohol/d) in Korean adults,&quot; but risk increased at higher alcohol consumption.

===Gallbladder effects===
Research has found that drinking reduces the risk of developing gallstones. Compared with alcohol abstainers, the relative risk of gallstone disease, controlling for age, sex, education, smoking, and body mass index, is 0.83 for occasional and regular moderate drinkers (&lt; 25 ml of ethanol per day), 0.67 for intermediate drinkers (25-50 ml per day), and 0.58 for heavy drinkers. This inverse association was consistent across strata of age, sex, and body mass index.&quot; Frequency of drinking also appears to be a factor. &quot;An increase in frequency of alcohol consumption also was related to decreased risk. Combining the reports of quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, a consumption pattern that reflected frequent intake (5–7 days/week) of any given amount of alcohol was associated with a decreased risk, as compared with nondrinkers. In contrast, infrequent alcohol intake (1–2 days/week) showed no significant association with risk.&quot;

A large self-reported study published in 1998 found no correlation between gallbladder disease and multiple factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and coffee consumption. A retrospective study from 1997 found vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplement use in drinkers was associated with a lower prevalence of gallbladder disease, but this association was not seen in non-drinkers.

===Liver disease===

During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is converted into reduced NAD. Normally, NAD is used to metabolize fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD. Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term &#x27;fatty liver&#x27;. Continued consumption (such as in alcohol use disorder) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death. These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.

Alcoholic liver disease is a major public health problem. For example, in the United States up to two million people have alcohol-related liver disorders. Chronic heavy alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver, cirrhosis, and alcoholic hepatitis. Treatment options are limited and consist of most importantly discontinuing alcohol consumption. In cases of severe liver disease, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant from alcohol abstinent donors. Research is being conducted into the effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Certain complementary medications, e.g., milk thistle and silymarin, appear to offer some benefit. Alcohol is a leading cause of liver cancer in the Western world, accounting for 32-45% of hepatic cancers. Up to half a million people in the United States develop alcohol-related liver cancer.

===Pancreatitis===
Alcohol misuse is a leading cause of both acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Alcoholic pancreatitis can result in severe abdominal pain and may progress to pancreatic cancer.
Chronic pancreatitis often results in intestinal malabsorption, and can result in diabetes.

=== Body composition===

Alcohol affects the nutritional state of chronic drinkers. It can decrease food consumption and lead to malabsorption. It can also create imbalances in skeletal muscle mass and cause muscle wasting. Chronic consumption of alcohol can also increase the breakdown of important proteins in the body which can affect gene expression.

== Oral and dental implications ==

=== Oral cancer ===
The consumption of alcohol alone is not associated with an increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); however, the synergistic consumption of alcohol and tobacco is positively associated with the occurrence of (OSCC), and significantly increases an individual&#x27;s risk. Studies confirm that alcohol dissolves the lipid component of epithelium and increases the permeability, amplifying the toxicity of carcinogenic components of tobacco. Limiting the overall consumption of the two has shown to reduce the risk of OSCC by three-fourth. The knowledge provided is useful for better understanding the differences in the effect of the combined consumption of alcohol and tobacco, in the development of OSCC.

Alcohol consumption has frequently been associated with an increased risk of oral cancer in current literature. Studies have found that people that consume alcohol were two times more likely to develop oral cancer in comparison to people who did not. The mechanisms in which alcohol acts as a carcinogen within the oral cavity are currently not fully understood. It is thought to be a multifactorial disease which then gives rise to a cancerous lesion. Many theories have become apparent in research, including alcohol being responsible for high estrogen and androgen levels, specifically in women, which may facilitate the alcohol-related immunodeficiency and/or immunosuppression that causes carcinogenesis. Therefore, immediate cessation of the habit of alcohol consumption can aid in decreasing the risk of oral cancer.

Alcohol-based mouthwashes used to be very common and can still be purchased for use today. Correlation in the presence of alcohol in mouthwashes with development of oral and pharyngeal cancer is unknown due to lack of evidence. However, it has been suggested that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, plays a role in the carcinogenesis of alcohol in oral cancer. Acetaldehyde, has been found to increase when in the salivary medium after an alcoholic beverage has been consumed and could possibly occur with alcohol-based mouthwashes as well, posing as a possible risk factor for oral cancer. However, more research must be conducted regarding these theories.

=== Periodontitis ===

Alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the gums around the teeth. There was also found to be a dose-response relationship in which the risk of periodontitis increased by 0.4% for each additional gram of daily alcohol consumption. Mechanisms explaining the relationship between the two are still unclear; however, several explanations have been suggested. One explanation is the weakening of neutrophil activity by alcohol consumption which potentially leads to bacterial overgrowth and increases bacterial penetration subsequently leading to periodontal inflammation and periodontal disease. Characteristics of the disease include shrinkage of gingival height and increased mobility of teeth which may exfoliate if the disease continues to progress. A patient&#x27;s consumption of alcohol needs to be monitored to estimate the risk of periodontitis, but further well-designed cohort studies are needed to reaffirm theses results.

==Other systems==

===Respiratory system===
Chronic alcohol ingestion can impair multiple critical cellular functions in the lungs. These cellular impairments can lead to increased susceptibility to serious complications from lung disease. Recent research cites alcoholic lung disease as comparable to liver disease in alcohol-related mortality. Alcoholics have a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and experience higher rates of mortality from ARDS when compared to non-alcoholics. In contrast to these findings, a large prospective study has shown a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on respiratory mortality.

===Kidney stones===
Research indicates that drinking beer or wine is associated with a lower risk of developing kidney stones.

===Sexual function in men===
Low to moderate alcohol consumption is shown to have protective effect for men&#x27;s erectile function. Several reviews and meta-analyses of existing literature show that low to moderate alcohol consumption significantly decrease erectile dysfunction risk.

Men&#x27;s sexual behaviors can be affected dramatically by high alcohol consumption. Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most studies
 (but not all) to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.

Long term excessive intake of alcohol can lead to damage to the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system resulting in loss of sexual desire and impotence in men. This is caused by reduction of testosterone from ethanol-induced testicular atrophy, resulting in increased feminisation of males and is a clinical feature of alcohol abusing males who have cirrhosis of the liver.

===Hormonal imbalance===
Excessive alcohol intake can result in hyperoestrogenisation. It has been speculated that alcoholic beverages may contain estrogen-like compounds. In men, high levels of estrogen can lead to testicular failure and the development of feminine traits including development of male breasts, called gynecomastia. In women, increased levels of estrogen due to excessive alcohol intake have been related to an increased risk of breast cancer.

=== Increased cortisol ===
Alcohol and cortisol have a complex relationship. While cortisol is a stress hormone, alcoholism can lead to increased cortisol levels in the body over time. This can be problematic because cortisol can temporarily shut down other bodily functions, potentially causing physical damage.

===Diabetes mellitus===
A meta-analysis determined the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol. Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective, and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol. A systematic review on intervention studies in women also supported this finding. It reported that alcohol consumption in moderation improved insulin sensitivity among women.

The way in which alcohol is consumed (i.e., with meals or binge drinking) affects various health outcomes. It may be the case that the risk of diabetes associated with heavy alcohol consumption is due to consumption mainly on the weekend as opposed to the same amount spread over a week. In the United Kingdom &quot;advice on weekly consumption is avoided&quot;. A twenty-year twin study from Finland reported that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. However, binge drinking and high alcohol consumption was found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Regular consumption of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of gouty arthritis and a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Two recent studies report that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Among those who drank regularly, the one-quarter who drank the most were up to 50% less likely to develop the disease compared to the half who drank the least.

The researchers noted that moderate alcohol consumption also reduces the risk of other inflammatory processes such as cardiovascular disease. Some of the biological mechanisms by which ethanol reduces the risk of destructive arthritis and prevents the loss of bone mineral density (BMD), which is part of the disease process.

A study concluded, &quot;Alcohol either protects from RA or, subjects with RA curtail their drinking after the manifestation of RA&quot;. Another study found, &quot;Postmenopausal women who averaged more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week had a reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis...&quot;

===Osteoporosis===
Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with higher bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. &quot;...Alcohol consumption significantly decreased the likelihood [of osteoporosis].&quot; &quot;Moderate alcohol intake was associated with higher BMD in postmenopausal elderly women.&quot; &quot;Social drinking is associated with higher bone mineral density in men and women [over 45].&quot; However, heavy alcohol use is associated with bone loss.

===Skin===
Chronic excessive alcohol use is associated with a wide range of skin disorders including urticaria, porphyria cutanea tarda, flushing, cutaneous stigmata of cirrhosis, psoriasis, pruritus, seborrheic dermatitis, and rosacea.

A 2010 study concluded, &quot;Nonlight beer intake is associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis among women. Other alcoholic beverages did not increase the risk of psoriasis in this study.&quot;

==Immune system==

===Bacterial infection===
Excessive alcohol consumption seen in people with an alcohol use disorder is a known risk factor for developing pneumonia.

===Common cold===
A study on the common cold found that &quot;Greater numbers of alcoholic drinks (up to three or four per day) were associated with decreased risk for developing colds because drinking was associated with decreased illness following infection. However, the benefits of drinking occurred only among nonsmokers. ... Although alcohol consumption did not influence risk of clinical illness for smokers, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk for nonsmokers.&quot;

Another study concluded, &quot;Findings suggest that wine intake, especially red wine, may have a protective effect against common cold. Beer, spirits, and total alcohol intakes do not seem to affect the incidence of common cold.&quot;

==Cancer==
In 1988, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the World Health Organization classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, stating &quot;There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans... Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).&quot; The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services&#x27; National Toxicology Program in 2000 listed alcohol as a &quot;known carcinogen&quot;.

It was estimated in 2006 that &quot;3.6% of all cancer cases worldwide are related to alcohol drinking, resulting in 3.5% of all cancer deaths.&quot; A European study from 2011 found that one in 10 of all cancers in men and one in 33 in women were caused by past or current alcohol intake. The World Cancer Research Fund panel report &quot;Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective&quot; finds the evidence &quot;convincing&quot; that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of the following cancers: mouth, pharynx and larynx, oesophagus, colorectum (men), breast (pre- and postmenopause).

Even light and moderate alcohol consumption increases cancer risk in individuals, especially with respect to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, oropharyngeal cancer, and breast cancer.

Acetaldehyde is the major metabolite when one drinks alcohol, produced in the liver, and it is known to be carcinogenic. It is suspected that this metabolite is the main reason alcohol promotes cancer. Typically the liver eliminates 99% of acetaldehyde produced. However, liver disease and certain genetic enzyme deficiencies result in high acetaldehyde levels. Heavy drinkers who are exposed to high acetaldehyde levels due to a genetic defect in alcohol dehydrogenase have been found to be at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver. A review in 2007 found &quot;convincing evidence that acetaldehyde... is responsible for the carcinogenic effect of ethanol... owing to its multiple mutagenic effects on DNA.&quot; Acetaldehyde can react with DNA to create DNA adducts including the Cr-PdG adduct. This Cr-PdG adduct &quot;is likely to play a central role in the mechanism of alcoholic beverage related carcinogenesis.&quot;

==Alcohol&#x27;s effect on the fetus==

Fetal alcohol syndrome or FAS is a birth defect that occurs in the offspring of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. More risks than benefits according to a survey of current knowledge. Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading known cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.

== Effects of alcoholism on family and children ==
Children raised in alcoholic families have the potential to suffer emotional distress as they move into their own committed relationships. These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. Feelings of depression and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. Women are more likely than men to be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence.

Children of alcoholics often incorporate behaviors learned as children into their marital relationships. These behaviors lead to poor parenting practices. For example, adult children of alcoholics may simultaneously express love and rejection toward a child or spouse. This is known as insecure attachment. Insecure attachment contributes to trust and bonding issues with intimate partners and offspring. In addition, prior parental emotional unavailability contributes to poor conflict resolution skills in adult relationships. Evidence shows a correlation between alcoholic fathers who display harsh and ineffective parenting practices with adolescent and adult alcohol dependence.
Children of alcoholics are often unable to trust other adults due to fear of abandonment. Further, because children learn their bonding behaviors from watching their parents&#x27; interactions, daughters of alcoholic fathers may be unable to interact appropriately with men when they reach adulthood. Poor behavior modeling by alcoholic parents contributes to inadequate understanding of how to engage in opposite gender interactions.

Sons of alcoholics are at risk for poor self-regulation that is often displayed in the preschool years. This leads to blaming others for behavioral problems and difficulties with impulse control. Poor decision-making correlates to early alcohol use, especially in sons of alcoholics. Sons often demonstrate thrill-seeking behavior, harm avoidance, and exhibit a low level of frustration tolerance.

== Economic impact from long-term consumption of alcohol ==
There is currently no consistent approach to measuring the economic impact of alcohol consumption. The economic burden such as direct, indirect, and intangible cost of diseases can be estimated through cost-of-illness studies. Direct costs are estimated through prevalence and incidence studies, while indirect costs are estimated through the human capital method, the demographic method, and the friction cost method. However, it is difficult to accurately measure the economic impact due to differences in methodologies, cost items related to alcohol consumption, and measurement techniques.

Alcohol dependence has a far reaching impact on health outcomes. A study conducted in Germany in 2016 found the economic burden for those dependent on alcohol was 50% higher than those who were not. In the study, over half of the economic cost was due to lost productivity, and only 6% was due to alcohol treatment programs. The economic cost was mostly borne by individuals between 30 and 49 years old. In another study conducted with data from eight European countries, 77% of alcohol dependent patients had psychiatric and somatic co-morbidity, which in turn increased systematic healthcare and economic cost. Alcohol consumption can also affect the immune system and produce complications in people with HIV, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.

Indirect costs due to alcohol dependence are significant. The biggest indirect cost comes from lost productivity, followed by premature mortality. Men with alcohol dependence in the U.S. have lower labor force participation by 2.5%, lower earnings by 5.0%, and higher absenteeism by 0.5–1.2 days. Female binge drinkers have higher absenteeism by 0.4–0.9 days. Premature mortality is another large contributor to indirect costs of alcohol dependence. In 2004, 3.8% of global deaths were attributable to alcohol (6.3% for men and 1.1% for women). Those under 60 years old have much higher prevalence in global deaths attributable to alcohol at 5.3%.

In general, indirect costs such as premature mortality due to alcohol dependence, loss of productivity due to absenteeism and presenteeism, and cost of property damage and enforcement, far exceed the direct health care and law enforcement costs. Aggregating the economic cost from all sources, the impact can range from 0.45 to 5.44% of a country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). The wide range is due to inconsistency in measurement of economic burden, as researchers in some studies attributed possible positive effects from long term alcohol consumption.

<text>The Evans Gambit is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

:1. 
:2. 
:3. 
:4. 

The Evans Gambit is an attacking line of the Giuoco Piano. White offers a pawn to divert the black bishop on c5. If Black accepts, White can follow up with c3 and d4, ripping open the , while also opening diagonals to play Ba3 or Qb3 at some point, preventing Black from castling and threatening the f7-pawn, respectively. If Black declines, the b4-pawn stakes out on the queenside, and White can follow up with a4 later in the game, potentially gaining a tempo by threatening to trap Black&#x27;s . 

According to Reuben Fine, the Evans Gambit poses a challenge for Black since the usual defences (playing ...d6 and/or returning the gambit pawn) are more difficult to achieve than with other gambits. (Fine was once beaten by this gambit in a against Bobby Fischer, in just 17 moves.)

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; has two codes for the Evans Gambit, C51 and C52.
==History==
The gambit is named after the Welsh sea captain William Davies Evans, the first player known to have played it. The first game with the opening is considered to be Evans–McDonnell, London 1827, although in that game a slightly different move order was tried (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 and only now 5.b4). In his monthly &quot;Chess Life&quot; column, Andrew Soltis commented that Evans was &quot;the first player to be widely honored for an opening we &quot;know&quot; he played&quot;. Dutch Grandmaster Paul van der Sterren described the Evans Gambit as &quot;unreal&quot; and &quot;fairylike&quot;.

The first analysis of the gambit was published in the &quot;Second Series of Progressive Lessons&quot; (1832) by William Lewis. The gambit became very popular and was played several times in the series of games between McDonnell and Louis de la Bourdonnais in 1834. Players including Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Mikhail Chigorin later took it up. The Evergreen Game won by Adolf Anderssen against Jean Dufresne opened with the Evans Gambit. Eventually, however, the second world chess champion Emanuel Lasker dealt a heavy blow to the opening with a modern defensive idea: returning the pawn under favourable circumstances. The opening was out of favour for much of the 20th century, although John Nunn and Jan Timman played it in some games in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the 1990s, Garry Kasparov used it in a few games (notably a famous 25-move win against Viswanathan Anand in Riga, 1995), which prompted a brief revival of interest in it.

==General remarks==
===Accepting the gambit===
Black&#x27;s usual response is to accept the gambit with 4...Bxb4; after which White plays 5.c3 and Black usually follows up with 5...Ba5 (5...Be7 and the less common 5...Bc5 and 5...Bd6, the Stone–Ware Defence, are also played). White usually follows up with 6.d4. Emanuel Lasker&#x27;s line is 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 d6 7.0-0 Bb6 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nxe5 Be6. This variation takes the sting out of White&#x27;s attack by returning the gambit pawn and exchanging queens, and according to Fine, &quot;is psychologically depressing for the gambit player&quot; whose intent is usually an aggressive attack. Chigorin did a lot of analysis on the alternative 9.Qb3 Qf6 10.Bg5 Qg6 11.Bd5 Nge7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7 13.Bxc6 Qxc6 14.Nxe5 Qe6, which avoids the exchange of queens, but reached no clear verdict. White often avoids this line with 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.dxe5, when Black can return the pawn with 8...Bb6 or hold onto it with 8...dxe5, though White obtains sufficient compensation in this line.

Alternatively, Black can meet 6.d4 with 6...exd4, when White can try 7.Qb3, a move often favoured by Nigel Short. 7.0-0 is traditionally met by 7...Nge7, intending to meet 8.Ng5 or 8.cxd4 with 8...d5 returning the pawn in many lines, rather than the 7...dxc3, which is well met by 8.Qb3 with a very dangerous initiative for the sacrificed pawns. Alternatively, 7...d6 8.cxd4 Bb6 is known as the &quot;Normal Position&quot;, in which Black is content to settle for a one-pawn advantage and White seeks compensation in the form of and a strong centre.

===Declining the gambit===
Alternatively, the gambit can be declined with 4...Bb6, to which 5.a4 a6 is the normal continuation. Due to the wasted tempo, most commentators consider declining the Evans Gambit to be weaker than accepting it and returning the pawn at a later stage. Black can also play the rare Countergambit Variation (4...d5), but this is thought to be dubious.

Aron Nimzowitsch claims in his book &quot;My System&quot; that declining the gambit does not lose a tempo, since b4 is developmentally unproductive— as is every pawn move, if it does not bear a logical connection with the centre. For suppose after 4...Bb6 5.b5 (to make a virtue of necessity and attempt something of a demobilizing effect with the ill-moved b-pawn move), 5...Nd4 and now if 6.Nxe5, then 6...Qg5 with a strong attack.

== Bishop retreats after accepting the gambit==
After 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3, the bishop must move or be captured. The common retreats are listed here, with the good and bad sides of each:

===5...Ba5===
Black&#x27;s most popular retreat according to Chessgames.com. It gets out of the way of White&#x27;s centre pawns, and pins the c3-pawn if White plays 6.d4, but it has the drawback of removing the a5-square from the black . Black usually subsequently retreats the bishop to b6 to facilitate ...Na5, which is particularly strong when White opts for the Bc4, Qb3 approach.

===5...Bc5===
The second most popular retreat according to Chessgames.com, with White scoring better than after 5...Ba5. This is often played by those unfamiliar with the Evans Gambit, and is arguably inferior to 5...Ba5, because 6.d4 attacks the bishop again and limits Black&#x27;s options as compared with 5...Ba5 6.d4.

===5...Be7===
The Anderssen Variation has often been considered one of the &quot;safer&quot; retreats and has been played by Viswanathan Anand. After 6.d4 Na5 White can attempt to maintain an initiative with 7.Be2 as played by Kasparov, or immediately recapture the pawn with 7.Nxe5.

===5...Bd6===
The Stone–Ware Defence, named after Henry Nathan Stone and Preston Ware, reinforces the e5-pawn and has been played by several grandmasters such as Andrei Volokitin, Alexander Grischuk and Loek van Wely.

===5...Bf8===
The Mayet Defence, named after Carl Mayet, is played very rarely as it undevelops a good bishop.

<doc id="337595" wikidata="Q1217770" url="?curid=337595" title="Voyagers!">
<text>Voyagers! is an American science-fiction television series about time travel that aired on NBC from October 3, 1982, to July 10, 1983, during the 1982–1983 season. The series starred Jon-Erik Hexum and Meeno Peluce.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Phineas Bogg (Jon-Erik Hexum) is one of a society of time travelers called Voyagers, who with the help of a young boy named Jeffrey Jones (played by Meeno Peluce) from 1982, uses a hand-held device called an Omni (which looks like a large pocket watch) that flashes red when history is wrong and green when the timeline is corrected, to travel in time and ensure that history unfolds correctly.

Bogg and Jeffrey first met when Bogg&#x27;s Omni malfunctioned and took him to 1982 (the device was not supposed to reach any later than 1970), landing him in the skyscraper apartment of Jeffrey&#x27;s aunt and uncle, who were caring for him after his parents&#x27; deaths. Bogg&#x27;s guidebook, which contained a detailed description of how history was supposed to unfold, was grabbed by Jeffrey&#x27;s dog Ralph, and in the struggle to retrieve it, Jeffrey accidentally fell out his bedroom window and Bogg jumped out to rescue him by activating the Omni. With his guidebook stuck in 1982, Bogg (who, being more interested in girls than in history, apparently never paid much attention in his Voyager training/history classes) had to rely on Jeffrey, whose father had been a history professor, to help him. Jeffrey&#x27;s knowledge proved invaluable; for example, in the first episode, Jeffrey ensured that baby Moses&#x27; basket traveled down the Nile, where it was met by the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter.

Phineas is a great womanizer and manages to fall for a beautiful woman in almost every episode. Whenever Jeffrey&#x27;s wisdom was paired up against Bogg&#x27;s stubbornness, Jeffrey usually wins out, to which Bogg would always mutter, &quot;Smart kids give me a pain!&quot; Another catchphrase used by Bogg as an expletive was &quot;Bat&#x27;s breath!&quot; They develop a strong relationship and become a formidable team. In the course of their adventures together, they sometimes encounter other Voyagers whose missions happened to overlap with theirs.

As revealed later in the series, despite Jeffrey&#x27;s age and the accidental circumstances of his first encounter with Phineas, he was always destined to become a Voyager.

Over the closing credits of each episode, regular cast member Meeno Peluce said in voice-over: &quot;If you want to learn more about [historical element from the episode], take a voyage down to your public library. It&#x27;s all in books!&quot;

==Cast==

* Jon-Erik Hexum as Phineas Bogg
* Meeno Peluce as Jeffrey Jones

==Reception==
Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the series as &quot;a live-action version of the Mr. Peabody and Sherman cartoons on the delightful old &#x27;Bullwinkle&#x27; show&quot; and &quot;largely a joy ride from start to finish.&quot;

&quot;Voyagers!&quot; ran for one season of 20 episodes, broadcast opposite the top-rated &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The series averaged a 17 share. &quot;Voyagers!&quot; seemed likely to be renewed for a second season, but controversies in &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reporting led executives to believe that &quot;60 Minutes&quot; might successfully be challenged by a competing news program, instead. NBC cancelled &quot;Voyagers!&quot; and replaced it with the news magazine program &quot;Monitor,&quot; which averaged only a 7 share. David Letterman poked fun at NBC&#x27;s cancellation of the series by airing a sketch on his &quot;Late Night&quot; program titled &quot;They Took My Show Away&quot;, a parody of an after-school special in which the host comforts a boy who was a &quot;Voyagers!&quot; fan.

===Television film===

In 1985, following the death of series lead Jon-Erik Hexum, Universal re-edited several episodes of the show into a television film. Entitled &quot;Voyager from the Unknown&quot;, the story combined the pilot episode and &quot;Voyagers of the Titanic&quot; into one feature-length film. This version incorporates new video special effects, some voice-over dubbing for Hexum and Peluce&#x27;s characters that changed, and added dialogue and new footage to include a supercomputer directing Voyager missions.

The opening begins with a narration and painted illustrations of Bogg receiving his guidebook on &quot;Planet Voyager&quot; by artist Jerry Gebr.

&quot;Far out in the cosmos there exists a planet known as Voyager, where the mystery of travel into space and through time has been solved. It is inhabited by a race who call themselves Voyagers. Their purpose is to keep constant surveillance on history. These people have a time machine device, the Omni, which will take them into the past, present or future. As each Voyager graduates he is given an omni and a guidebook. One such graduate Phineas Bogg, who was assigned as a field worker to operate in certain time zones.&quot;

===VHS release===
The re-edited telefilm was issued on VHS by MCA Home Video in 1985. It was the only official release of &quot;Voyagers!&quot; on home video in the US until the DVD release in 2007.

===DVD release===
On July 17, 2007, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released all 20 episodes of &quot;Voyagers!&quot; on DVD in Region 1. It was released in Region 2 on October 29, 2007.

===Streaming===
All 20 episodes are also available in the United States by streaming through Amazon Prime Video.

As of September 2024, the series was available on The Roku Channel.

<text>Amersham () is a London Underground station in the market town of Amersham in Buckinghamshire, England which is also used by National Rail services.

Amersham station is a terminus of the London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. It is 23.7 miles (38.1 km) northwest of Charing Cross, making it the second furthest Underground station from central London and the second most westerly station of the whole London Underground system, after . It is in Travelcard Zone 9 (previously zone D).

The station has the highest elevation on the entire London Underground network at 147m above sea-level, higher than Big Ben tower. 

Amersham station is also served by Chiltern Railways, which runs trains between London Marylebone and Aylesbury. From Aylesbury a shuttle service to Princes Risborough provides access to through services between Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill. The journey times between Amersham and Central London range between 33 and 60 minutes. The journey time between Amersham and Chalfont &amp; Latimer is about three and a half minutes.

==History==
The station was opened on 1 September 1892 as part of the Metropolitan Railway (Met) extension from Chalfont Road (now Chalfont &amp; Latimer) to Aylesbury. On 12 March 1922, its name was changed to &quot;Amersham &amp; Chesham Bois&quot;, but the original name was restored during 1937.

From 16 March 1899, the Great Central Railway served the station through its extension to Marylebone. Consequently, the station became joint Met/GCR owned. On 1 January 1923, the GCR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) under the Railways Act 1921, and on 1 July 1933 the Met became part of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), becoming the Metropolitan line of the London Underground. On 1 January 1948, the LNER was nationalised, its share of the station initially coming under the control of the Eastern Region of British Railways, before being transferred to the London Midland Region in 1958.

On 12 September 1960, the tracks from Rickmansworth to Amersham were electrified, partially fulfilling plans first proposed some thirty years earlier. The rolling stock ordered by London Underground as part of this project, the A60 stock, is named after Amersham.

===Service changes===
When the sectorisation of British Rail took place in 1982, services to Aylesbury on what had by now become the London to Aylesbury Line came under the operation of Network SouthEast. Following the privatisation of British Rail in the early 1990s, these services have been provided by Chiltern Railways.

From December 2010, off-peak Metropolitan line services to and from Amersham were reduced to two per hour, with a corresponding increase in through services on the Chesham branch. This is a return to the historically normal frequency of two Metropolitan trains per hour from the four Metropolitan trains per hour service that had been operating for the previous five years. Including the Chiltern Railways services, Amersham still has four trains an hour to London in total, with extra trains from both operators at peak hours. Metropolitan line services are divided 50:50 between Amersham and Chesham. This is expected to divide park and ride or kiss and ride motorist users more evenly between the two stations and help spread the load on local roads, though the change was made purely for operational reasons.

==The station today==
The station is located on Station Approach, Amersham. Ticket barriers are in operation at the station.

In 2009, because of financial constraints, Transport for London (TfL) decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Amersham and five other stations, on the grounds that these are relatively quiet stations and some are already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. In 2017, TfL announced that Amersham station would receive funding for step-free access, and that work would begin in 2018. It was opened in February 2021.

==Services==
Services at Amersham are operated by Chiltern Railways and London Underground on the Metropolitan line. The off-peak service at the station is:
* 2 tph to Aldgate (All Stations)
* 2 tph to London Marylebone
* 2 tph to of which 1 continues to

<doc id="337597" wikidata="Q2907027" url="?curid=337597" title="Operation Pitchfork">
<text>From 13–18 May 1948 Jewish forces from the Haganah and Irgun executed Operation Pitchfork (&quot;mivtza kilshon&quot;). Its aim was to capture the Jewish suburbs of Jerusalem, particularly Talbiya in central Jerusalem.

==Operation==
At midnight on Friday 14 May, the British declared their civil and military authority in Jerusalem to be at an end. In the morning they evacuated the city in two large convoys, one moved north towards Haifa and the other south towards Bethlehem. The Zionists managed to obtain a schedule of their withdrawal in advance and could thereafter launch the operation almost immediately.
The Yishuv forces quickly managed to take control of buildings that the British had nationalized in &quot;Bevingrad&quot; zones. These were heavily fortified security zones that the British had built up around key installations in the city to protect against Irgun attacks. From 1946 to 1948, security zones with huge coils of barbed wire filling the streets and dragon&#x27;s teeth blocking the incursion of armed vehicles began appearing around Jerusalem. One such zone, established in 1946, encompassed the eastern end of Jaffa Road and included the Russian Compound, the Anglo-Palestine Bank, the Central Post Office, and the Generali Building. Jerusalemites called these fortified zones &quot;Bevingrad&quot;, a portmanteau of the name of the British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, who had denied Holocaust survivors entry to Palestine, and the Russian city of Stalingrad, where large-scale fortifications had been emplaced prior to the 1942 Battle of Stalingrad.

On Friday, 14 May 1948, the Irgun forces headed for the Bevingrad on Jaffa Road. The first building they captured was the Generali Building, now evacuated. The Irgun forces hoisted the Israeli flag over the lion statue on the roof before moving on to take control of the Russian Compound and the Police Academy further north.

They also captured the Notre Dame Church, the American Colony, Sheikh Jarrah, Talbiya, German Colony, Baka, Talpiot, and the Greek Colony.

A large portion of what was captured was to become the Israeli-controlled portion of Jerusalem—&quot;West Jerusalem&quot;—but some of the heaviest battles of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war were to follow and the Jerusalem frontier was to be redrawn many times.

<text>(born 1964) is a Japanese game director and game producer who currently works for Japanese Social Game company GREE. He formerly worked for Square Enix Co., Ltd. (formerly Square Co., Ltd.). He is most notably credited for creating the &quot;Front Mission&quot; and &quot;Arc the Lad&quot; media franchises.

==Biography==

===Masaya and G-Craft===
Toshiro Tsuchida worked for Japanese development studios Masaya and G-Craft, the latter of which he founded in 1993 after leaving Masaya. During the development of &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; and &quot;Front Mission Alternative&quot;, Square initiated talks with Tsuchida in an attempt to purchase G-Craft in 1997. As the buyout occurred during &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;&#x27;s development, it became the last title with G-Craft credited as the developer.

===Square Enix===
Tsuchida was also the battle director for both &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. As battle director of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, he changed the recurring battle system in the series. Whereas Hiroyuki Ito had created the Active Time Battle system in &quot;Final Fantasy IV, T&quot;suchida would create the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system to make things more strategic. He kept &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; in mind when working on &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Tsuchida was the head of Product Development Division-6 within Square Enix.

He produced &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King&quot;, and stated that Square Enix was excited to be the first ones to bring a new game to Wiiware game platform. The game concept was to take the role of the king, not the hero, and the Crystal Chronicles series has a large amount of character interactions. Game development began before the Wiiware tools were distributed. Developing &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King&quot; required a change from the typical way the Square Enix developed games, switching from starting with the graphics and to beginning with gameplay.

He has recently worked on &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; as the battle planning director in 2010. Toshiro left Square Enix Co., Ltd. on February 28, 2011.

===GREE===
He works in a department working with developers to create new video games.

===Return to Sony===
In 2016 he returned to work with Sony&#x27;s ForwardWorks to develop a mobile &quot;Arc The Lad&quot; reboot

<doc id="337601" wikidata="Q335965" url="?curid=337601" title="Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson">
<text>Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, (11 August 1852 – 2 December 1928) was a British aristocrat who served as the second governor-general of Australia, in office from 1903 to 1904. He was previously Governor of South Australia from 1899 to 1902.

Tennyson was born in Twickenham, Middlesex, and educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the eldest son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and served as his personal secretary and biographer; he succeeded to his father&#x27;s title in 1892. Tennyson was made Governor of South Australia in 1899. When Lord Hopetoun resigned the governor-generalship in mid-1902, Tennyson was the longest-serving state governor and thus became Administrator of the Government. Tennyson was eventually chosen to be Hopetoun&#x27;s permanent replacement, but accepted only a one-year term. He was more popular than his predecessor among the general public, but had a tense relationship with Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and was not offered an extension to his term. Tennyson retired to the Isle of Wight, and spent the rest of his life upholding his father&#x27;s legacy.

==Early life==

Hallam Tennyson was born in Chapel House, a house his father was renting in Twickenham, Middlesex. His parents were Emily (née Sellwood) and Alfred Tennyson. He was named after his father&#x27;s deceased friend Arthur Hallam. Tennyson&#x27;s early childhood was spent at Farringford House on the Isle of Wight, which his father began renting in 1853 and bought in 1856. He was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. Tennyson&#x27;s career aspirations ended when his parents&#x27; age and ill-health obliged him to leave Cambridge to become their personal secretary. The idea of going into politics was also abandoned.

It was partly for Hallam&#x27;s benefit that Alfred Tennyson accepted a peerage in 1884, the year Hallam married Audrey Georgiana Florence Boyle (after being disappointed in his love for Mary Gladstone, daughter of William Ewart Gladstone). On his father&#x27;s death in 1892, he inherited the title Baron Tennyson, and also the role of official biographer. His &quot;Tennyson: A Memoir&quot; was published in 1897.

==Governor of South Australia==
Like his father, Tennyson was an ardent imperialist, and in 1883 he had become a council member of the Imperial Federation League, a lobby group set up to support the imperialist ideas of the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain. It was this connection, as well as the Tennyson name, that led Chamberlain to offer Tennyson the position of Governor of South Australia in 1899. He was still in this position in May 1902, when the Governor-General of Australia, the Earl of Hopetoun, suddenly announced his intention to resign.

==Governor-General of Australia==

Tennyson was the senior state governor at the time of Hopetoun&#x27;s announcement, and thus became Administrator of the Government upon his departure from Australia on 17 July 1902. There were some doubts about his ability to fill the job on a permanent basis since he had little experience of politics. But he had made a good impression in Australia through his modesty and frugality, unlike the ostentatiously imperious Hopetoun. In December 1902 he accepted the post for, at his own suggestion, a one-year appointment only.

The new Governor-General was popular and got on with Australians far better than his predecessor had done. But problems arose through the ambiguity of his position. The Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, insisted that the Governor-General&#x27;s official secretary must be appointed and paid by the Australian government. The British government objected (privately) because this would mean that the Governor-General could not carry out what was seen in London as his broader role in supervising the Australian government. Tennyson shared this view.

As a result, relations between Deakin and Tennyson grew tense. Deakin correctly suspected that Tennyson was reporting on him to London and trying to interfere on matters of policy, such as the naval agreement between Britain and Australia. For this reason Deakin did not encourage Tennyson to seek an extension of his one-year term. None of this was known to the public and Tennyson left Australia in January 1904 to universal expressions of approval.

==Retirement and death==

Tennyson spent the rest of his life at Farringford, serving as deputy Governor of the Isle of Wight from 1913. His wife died in 1916, and in 1918 he remarried to Mary &quot;May&quot; Emily Prinsep (1853–1931). She was the daughter of Charles Robert Prinsep, Indian-born Advocate-General of Calcutta and later the owner of a large nutmeg plantation in Singapore, and niece of Sir Henry Thoby Prinsep, who adopted her when she was eleven upon her father&#x27;s death. Tennyson was May Prinsep&#x27;s second husband; her first husband was Andrew Hichens (d. 1906). The National Portrait Gallery has eight photographs of May Prinsep, taken by her relative Julia Margaret Cameron on the Isle of Wight.

Tennyson bequeathed many of his father&#x27;s notebooks to Trinity College in 1924.

He had three sons by his first wife: 

* Lionel Hallam Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson (7 November 1889 – 6 June 1951), married Hon. Clare Tennant, daughter of Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner; remarried to Carroll Donner (née Elting)
* Sub-Lieutenant Hon. Harold Courtenay Tennyson (1896–1916), killed in action during World War I
* Captain Hon. Alfred Aubrey Tennyson (1891–1918), killed in action during World War I

Tennyson died at Farringford on 2 December 1928.

==Commemoration==
* A large oil portrait of Tennyson hangs in Admiralty House, Kirribilli.
* Tennyson&#x27;s coat of arms is painted in the entry foyer of Government House, Sydney.
* Tennyson endowed £100 to the University of Adelaide in 1900 to establish the Tennyson Medal, as an award for the student who achieves the highest result in English Literary Studies in the final year of secondary education in South Australia.

<doc id="337605" wikidata="Q689519" url="?curid=337605" title="Pachelbel's Canon">
<text>Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon (also known as Canon in D, P 37) is an accompanied canon by the German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. The canon was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue, known as &quot;Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo&quot;. Both movements are in the key of D major. The piece is constructed as a true canon at the unison in three parts, with a fourth part as a ground bass throughout. Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known (suggested dates range from 1680 to 1706), and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from 1838 to 1842.

Like his other works, Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon went out of style, and remained in obscurity for centuries. A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-François Paillard chamber orchestra gained popularity over the next decade, and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable. From the 1970s, elements of the piece, especially its chord progression, were used in a variety of pop songs. Since the 1980s, it has also found increasingly common use in weddings and funeral ceremonies in the Western world.

==Creation==
In his lifetime, Pachelbel was renowned for his organ and other keyboard music, whereas today he is also recognized as an important composer of church and chamber music. Little of his chamber music survives, however. Only &quot;&quot;—a collection of partitas published during Pachelbel&#x27;s lifetime—is known, apart from a few isolated pieces in manuscripts. The Canon and Gigue in D major is one such piece. A single 19th-century manuscript copy of them survives, Mus.MS 16481/8 in the Berlin State Library. It contains two more chamber suites. Another copy, previously in Hochschule der Künste in Berlin, is now lost.

The circumstances of the piece&#x27;s composition are wholly unknown. Hans-Joachim Schulze, writing in 1985, suggested that the piece may have been composed for Johann Christoph Bach&#x27;s wedding, on 23 October 1694, which Pachelbel attended. Johann Ambrosius Bach, Pachelbel, and other friends and family provided music for the occasion. Johann Christoph Bach, the oldest brother of Johann Sebastian Bach, was a pupil of Pachelbel. Pachelbel scholar Kathryn Jane Welter considers this &quot;pure speculation&quot;. Another scholar, Charles E. Brewer, investigated a variety of possible connections between Pachelbel&#x27;s and Heinrich Biber&#x27;s published chamber music. His research indicated that the Canon may have been composed in response to a chaconne with canonic elements which Biber published as part of Partia III of &quot;Harmonia artificioso-ariosa&quot;. That would indicate that Pachelbel&#x27;s piece cannot be dated earlier than 1696, the year of publication of Biber&#x27;s collection. Other dates of the Canon&#x27;s composition are occasionally suggested, for example, as early as 1680.

==Rediscovery and rise to fame==
The canon (without the accompanying gigue) was first published in 1919 by scholar Gustav Beckmann, who included the score in his article on Pachelbel&#x27;s chamber music. His research was inspired and supported by early music scholar and editor Max Seiffert, who in 1929 published his arrangement of the &quot;Canon and Gigue&quot; in his Organum series. However, that edition contained numerous articulation marks and dynamics not in the original score. Furthermore, Seiffert provided tempi he considered right for the piece, but that were not supported by later research. The canon was first recorded in Berlin in 1938 by Hermann Diener and His Music College, under the title, &#x27;Dreistimmiger Kanon mit Generalbass&#x27;.

In 1968, the Jean-François Paillard chamber orchestra made a recording of the piece that would change its fortunes significantly. This rendition was done in a more Romantic style, at a significantly slower tempo than it had been played at before, and contained &quot;obbligato&quot; parts, written by Paillard. The Paillard recording was released in June in France by Erato Records as part of an LP record that also included the Trumpet Concerto by Johann Friedrich Fasch and other works by Pachelbel and Fasch, all played by the Jean-François Paillard chamber orchestra. Paillard&#x27;s interpretation of the canon was also included on a widely distributed album by the mail-order label Musical Heritage Society in 1968.

In July 1968, Greek band Aphrodite&#x27;s Child released the single &quot;Rain and Tears&quot;, which was a baroque-rock adaptation of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. The band was based in France at the time, although it is unknown whether they had heard the Paillard recording, or were inspired by it. &quot;Rain and Tears&quot; was a success, reaching number 1 on the pop charts of various European countries. Several months later, in October 1968, Spanish band Pop-Tops released the single &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord&quot;, which again was based on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. Again, it is unknown whether they were aware of or had been inspired by the releases from earlier that year. &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord&quot; was covered by American band Parliament on their 1970 album &quot;Osmium&quot;.

In 1970, a classical radio station in San Francisco played the Paillard recording and became inundated by listener requests. The piece gained growing fame, particularly in California. In 1974, London Records, aware of the interest in the piece, reissued a 1961 album of the Corelli Christmas Concerto performed by the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, which happened to contain the piece, now re-titled to &quot;Pachelbel Kanon: the Record That Made it Famous and other Baroque Favorites&quot;. The album was the highest-selling classical album of 1976. Its success led to many other record labels issuing their own recordings of the work, many of which also sold well.

Its use from 1975 in television ads for Pure New Wool popularised the piece in Britain and Ireland.

In 1977, the RCA Red Seal label reissued the original Erato album in the United States and elsewhere. In the U.S. it was the 6th-highest-selling classical album of 1977. (Two other albums containing Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon charted for the year: the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra album at number 17, and another album featuring the Paillard recording, &quot;Go For Baroque!&quot;, at number 13.) The Paillard arrangement of the piece was then featured prominently in the soundtrack of the 1980 film &quot;Ordinary People&quot;. The Erato/RCA album kept climbing the &quot;Billboard&quot; Classical Albums chart, and in January 1982 it reached the number 1 position, where it remained until May 1982, when it was knocked out of first place by an album featuring Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon played by the Academy of Ancient Music directed by Christopher Hogwood. The canon was selected for the soundtrack of Carl Sagan&#x27;s popular 1980 American PBS television series &quot;&quot;, and the astronomer cited this work as one of his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on the BBC on 18 July 1981. In 1981 &quot;The Music of Cosmos&quot;, an album by RCA Records, and in 2000 a CD by the Cosmos Studios label of the soundtrack were published, that feature an arrangement of the canon by Glenn Spreen and James Galway.

In 1982, pianist George Winston included his &quot;Variations on the Kanon by Johann Pachelbel&quot; on his solo piano album &quot;December&quot;, which has sold over three million copies.

==Analysis==
The canon is in three voices spaced by a span of two measures; it unfolds over an ostinato in the bass which provides the harmonic basis for the piece, implying a progression of eight chords:

The harmonic progression follows a sequential pattern known as the Romanesca, which according to Robert Gjerdingen was a common schema during the 17th and 18th centuries.

In Germany, Italy and France of the 17th century, some pieces built on an ostinato bass were called chaconnes or passacaglias; such works sometimes incorporate some form of variation in the upper voices. While some writers consider each of the 28 statements of the ground bass a separate variation, one scholar finds that Pachelbel&#x27;s canon is constructed of just 12 variations, mostly four bars in length, and describes them as follows:
# (bars 3–6) quarter notes
# (bars 7–10) eighth notes
# (bars 11–14) sixteenth notes
# (bars 15–18) leaping quarter notes, rest
# (bars 19–22) thirty-second-note pattern on scalar melody
# (bars 23–26) staccato, eighth notes and rests
# (bars 27–30) sixteenth-note extensions of melody with upper neighbor notes
# (bars 31–38) repetitive sixteenth-note patterns
# (bars 39–42) dotted rhythms
# (bars 43–46) dotted rhythms and sixteenth-note patterns on upper neighbor notes
# (bars 47–50) syncopated quarter- and eighth-note rhythm
# (bars 51–56) eighth-note octave leaps

Pachelbel&#x27;s canon thus merges a strict polyphonic form (the canon) and a variation form (the chaconne). Pachelbel skillfully constructs the variations to make them &quot;both pleasing and subtly undetectable.&quot;

===Gigue===
The gigue is set in time and consists of 2 equal sections of 10 bars each. Unlike the canon, the gigue neither has a repeating bass voice nor a set chord progression. The gigue exhibits fugal writing, with each section introducing a brief melodic statement which is then imitated in the other voices.

==Parodies==
In its August 17, 1981, issue the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published a cartoon by Mick Stevens captioned &quot;Prisoner of Pachelbel&quot;, in which a prisoner hears over the loudspeaker: &quot;For your listening pleasure, we once again present Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon.&quot;

The 1991 musical parody album &quot;WTWP Classical Talkity-Talk Radio&quot; by P. D. Q. Bach is set at a fictional radio station whose call letters stand for &quot;Wall-To-Wall Pachelbel&quot;.

In 2017, BBC Radio 4 sketch show &quot;John Finnemore&#x27;s Souvenir Programme&quot; featured a sketch entitled &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; in which Pachelbel is annoyed by the fact the only thing people know him for is his Canon. The same episode features a parody called &quot;Loose Canon&quot; in which Pachelbel sings about his frustrations to the tune of the Canon.

==Influence on popular music==

Several months after the Paillard recording was released, in 1968, two groups released successful singles with a backing track based on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon: Greek band Aphrodite&#x27;s Child with &quot;Rain and Tears&quot; and Spanish group Pop-Tops with &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord&quot;.

In 2002, pop music producer Pete Waterman described Canon in D as &quot;almost the godfather of pop music because we&#x27;ve all used that in our own ways for the past 30 years&quot;. He also said that Kylie Minogue&#x27;s 1988 UK number one hit single &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, which Waterman co-wrote and co-produced, was inspired by Canon in D. The Farm&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;All Together Now&quot; has its chord sequence lifted directly from Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon.

The Pet Shop Boys&#x27; 1993 cover of &quot;Go West&quot; played up that song&#x27;s resemblance to both Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon and the Soviet Anthem. Coolio&#x27;s 1997 &quot;C U When U Get There&quot; is built around a sample of the piece. Other songs that make use of the Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon chord progression include &quot;Streets of London&quot; by Ralph McTell (1974), &quot;Gemilang&quot; by Krakatau (1986), &quot;Basket Case&quot; by Green Day (1994), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; by Oasis (1996) (though with a variation at the end), while Maroon 5 used the harmonic sequence of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon (and part of the melody) for their 2019 single &quot;Memories&quot;.

In 2012, the UK-based Co-Operative Funeralcare compiled a list of the most popular, classical, contemporary and religious music across 30,000 funerals. Canon in D placed second on the Classical chart, behind Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot;.

The Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;Christmas Canon&quot; is a &quot;take&quot; on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. JerryC&#x27;s version, titled &quot;Canon Rock&quot;, was one of the earliest viral videos on YouTube when it was covered by Funtwo. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; on Procol Harum&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Novum&quot; is based on just the chords of the canon.

<text>Echocardiography, also known as cardiac ultrasound, is the use of ultrasound to examine the heart. It is a type of medical imaging, using standard ultrasound or Doppler ultrasound. The visual image formed using this technique is called an echocardiogram, a cardiac echo, or simply an echo.

Echocardiography is routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic imaging modalities in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, location and extent of any tissue damage, and assessment of valves. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).

Echocardiography is an important tool in assessing wall motion abnormality in patients with suspected cardiac disease. It is a tool which helps in reaching an early diagnosis of myocardial infarction, showing regional wall motion abnormality. Also, it is important in treatment and follow-up in patients with heart failure, by assessing ejection fraction.

Echocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease.

The most important advantages of echocardiography are that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.

Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart by Doppler echocardiography, using pulsed- or continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler, is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right sides of the heart, as well as any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and can also estimate how well the valves open (or do not open in the case of valvular stenosis). The Doppler technique can also be used for tissue motion and velocity measurement, by tissue Doppler echocardiography.

Echocardiography was also the first ultrasound subspecialty to use intravenous contrast. Echocardiography is performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK), or physicians trained in echocardiography.

Recognized as the &quot;Father of Echocardiography&quot;, the Swedish physician Inge Edler (1911–2001), a graduate of Lund University, was the first of his profession to apply ultrasonic pulse echo imaging in diagnosing cardiac disease, which the acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone had developed to detect defects in metal castings. In fact, Edler in 1953 produced the first echocardiographs using an industrial Firestone-Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope. In developing echocardiography, Edler worked with the physicist Carl Hellmuth Hertz, the son of the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz and grandnephew of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz.

==Medical uses==
Health societies recommend the use of echocardiography for initial diagnosis when a change in the patient&#x27;s clinical status occurs and when new data from an echocardiogram would result in the physician changing the patient&#x27;s care. Diagnostic criteria for numerous cardiac diseases are based on echocardiography studies. For example, the differentiation of mild, moderate, and severe valvular disease is based upon measured criteria. Another example is the estimation of heart function by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has vast uses including classification of heart failure and cut offs for implantation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.

Health societies do not recommend routine testing when the patient has no change in clinical status or when a physician is unlikely to change care for the patient based on the results of testing. A common example of overuse of echocardiography when not indicated is the use of routine testing in response to a patient diagnosis of mild valvular heart disease. In this case, patients are often asymptomatic for years before the onset of deterioration and the results of the echocardiogram would not result in a change in care without other change in clinical status.

Echocardiography has a vast role in pediatrics, diagnosing patients with valvular heart disease and other congenital abnormalities. An emerging branch is fetal echocardiography, which involves echocardiography of an unborn fetus.

==Types==
There are three primary types of echocardiography: transthoracic, transesophageal, and intracardic.
Stress testing utilizes tranthoracic echo in combination with an exercise modality (e.g., a treadmill).
Intravascular ultrasound is included below, but is as the name indicates more &quot;ultrasound&quot; than &quot;echocardiography&quot; as it is imaging the walls of a vessel rather than the heart.

===Transthoracic echocardiogram===

A standard echocardiogram is also known as a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or cardiac ultrasound, and it is used for rapid evaluation of a patient at their bedside. In this case, the echocardiography transducer (or probe) is placed on the chest wall (or thorax) of the subject, and images are taken through the chest wall. This is a non-invasive, highly accurate, and quick assessment of the overall function of the heart.

TTE utilizes several &quot;windows&quot; to image the heart from different perspectives. Each window has advantages and disadvantages for viewing specific structures within the heart and, typically, numerous windows are utilized within the same study to fully assess the heart. Parasternal long and parasternal short axis windows are taken next to the sternum, the apical two/three/four chamber windows are taken from the apex of the heart (lower left side), and the subcostal window is taken from underneath the edge of the last rib.

TTE utilizes one- (&quot;M mode&quot;), two-, and three-dimensional ultrasound (time is implicit and not included) from the different windows. These can be combined with pulse wave or continuous wave Doppler to visualize the velocity of blood flow and structure movements. Images can be enhanced with &quot;contrast&quot; that are typically some sort of micro bubble suspension that reflect the ultrasound waves.

===Transesophageal echocardiogram===

A transesophageal echocardiogram is an alternative way to perform an echocardiogram. A specialized probe containing an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient&#x27;s esophagus via the mouth, allowing image and Doppler evaluation from a location directly behind the heart. It is most often used when transthoracic images are suboptimal and when a clearer and more precise image is needed for assessment. This test is performed in the presence of a cardiologist, anesthesiologist, registered nurse, and ultrasound technologist. Conscious sedation and/or localized numbing medication may be used to make the patient more comfortable during the procedure.

TEE, unlike TTE, does not have discrete &quot;windows&quot; to view the heart. The entire esophagus and stomach can be utilized, and the probe advanced or removed along this dimension to alter the perspective on the heart. Most probes include the ability to deflect the tip of the probe in one or two dimensions to further refine the perspective of the heart. Additionally, the ultrasound crystal is often a two-dimension crystal and the ultrasound plane being used can be rotated electronically to permit an additional dimension to optimize views of the heart structures. Often, movement in all of these dimensions is needed.

TEE can be used as stand-alone procedures, or incorporated into catheter- or surgical-based procedures. For example, during a valve replacement surgery the TEE can be used to assess the valve function immediately before repair/replacement and immediately after. This permits revising the valve mid-surgery, if needed, to improve outcomes of the surgery.

=== Stress echocardiography ===

A stress echocardiogram, also known as a stress echo, uses ultrasound imaging of the heart to assess the wall motion in response to physical stress. First, images of the heart are taken &quot;at rest&quot; to acquire a baseline of the patient&#x27;s wall motion at a resting heart rate. The patient then walks on a treadmill or uses another exercise modality to increase the heart rate to his or her target heart rate, or 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 − patient&#x27;s age). Finally, images of the heart are taken &quot;at stress&quot; to assess wall motion at the peak heart rate. A stress echo assesses wall motion of the heart; it does not, however, create an image of the coronary arteries directly. Ischemia of one or more coronary arteries could cause a wall motion abnormality, which could indicate coronary artery disease. The gold standard test to directly create an image of the coronary arteries and directly assess for stenosis or occlusion is a cardiac catheterization. A stress echo is not invasive and is performed in the presence of a licensed medical professional, such as a cardiologist, and a cardiac sonographer.

=== Intracardiac echocardiography ===

Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is specialized form of echocardiography that uses catheters to insert the ultrasound probe inside the heart to view structures from within the heart.
ICE is often used as a part of the cardiac procedure of crossing the interatrial septum with a transseptal puncture to permit catheter access from the right atrium to the left atrium; alternative access to the left heart would be retrograde through the aorta and across the aortic valve into the left ventricle.

ICE has the benefit over transthoracic echocardiography in that an operator who is performing a sterile procedure can also operate the ICE catheter and it is not limited to visibility problems that can arise with transthoracic or transesophageal echo. Though, there are image quality limitations due to size constraints of the probe being limited to a catheter.

ICE is often inserted through the femoral vein and into the right atrium.
From the right atrium, visualization of the interatrial septum, all four cardiac chambers, all four valves, and the pericardial space (for an effusion) can be readily visualized.
It can also be advanced across the atrial septum into the left atrium to visualize the left atrial appendage during left atrial appendage occlusion device deployment.

Utilization of ICE imagery can be incorporated into the 3-D models built with electroanatomic mapping systems.

===Intravascular ultrasound===
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a specialized form of echocardiography that uses a catheter to insert the ultrasound probe inside blood vessels. This is commonly used to measure the size of blood vessels and to measure the internal diameter of the blood vessel. For example, this can be used in a coronary angiogram to assess the narrowing of the coronary artery. If the catheter is retraced in a controlled manner, then an internal map can be generated to see the contour of the vessel and its branches.

==Modes==

The various modes describe how the ultrasound crystals are used to obtain information. These modes are common to all types of echocardiography.

===A-mode===
A-scan or one dimensional ultrasound represents over half the standard ECHO exam. For example, it is how aortic stenosis valve area (or any obstruction). It is also how pressures are calculated in the heart such as right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP). It is usually used in the form of Doppler measurements. There are two forms, pulse and continuous. Pulsed allows velocities to be calculated in a specific place, but has a limited velocity range is can be used. Continuous wave allows the velocity to be measured from zero to the fastest blood velocities a diseased heart can generate. However, it can not tell you where in the A-scan the high velocity is coming from. Continuous wave would be used to calculate aortic stenosis because you know the high velocity is coming from the stenosis region. Pulsed would be used to find a ventricular septal defect where there should be no velocity across the septum and the pulsed tells you the location.

===B-mode / 2D===
Brightness mode is often synonymous with &quot;2D&quot; and is very commonly used in echocardiography.

===M-mode===
Motion mode, though less commonly used, plays an important role in modern echocardiography. It has an advantage over 2D echocardiography due to its high temporal resolution (up to 1000 frames/sec). Examples of its use include accurate measurement of LV size, assessment for presence of cardiac tamponade, and assessment of RV function with TAPSE (tricuspid annular systolic plane excursion).

===Strain rate imaging (deformation echocardiography)===

Strain rate imaging is an ultrasound method for imaging regional differences in contraction (dyssynergy) in for instance ischemic heart disease or dyssynchrony due to Bundle branch block. Strain rate imaging measures either regional systolic deformation (strain) or the rate of regional deformation (strain rate). The methods used are either tissue Doppler or Speckle tracking echocardiography.

===Three-dimensional echocardiography===
Three-dimensional echocardiography (also known as four-dimensional echocardiography when the picture is moving) is possible using a matrix array ultrasound probe and an appropriate processing system. It enables detailed anatomical assessment of cardiac pathology, particularly valvular defects, and cardiomyopathies. The ability to slice the virtual heart in infinite planes in an anatomically appropriate manner and to reconstruct three-dimensional images of anatomic structures make it unique for the understanding of the congenitally malformed heart. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography can be used to guide the location of bioptomes during right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, placement of catheter-delivered valvular devices, and in many other intraoperative assessments.

Three-dimensional echocardiography technology may feature anatomical intelligence, or the use of organ-modeling technology, to automatically identify anatomy based on generic models. All generic models refer to a dataset of anatomical information that uniquely adapts to variability in patient anatomy to perform specific tasks. Built on feature recognition and segmentation algorithms, this technology can provide patient-specific three-dimensional modeling of the heart and other aspects of the anatomy, including the brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, rib cage, and vertebral column.

===Contrast echocardiography===
Contrast echocardiography or contrast-enhanced ultrasound is the addition of an ultrasound contrast medium, or imaging agent, to traditional ultrasonography. The ultrasound contrast is made up of tiny microbubbles filled with a gas core and protein shell. This allows the microbubbles to circulate through the cardiovascular system and return the ultrasound waves, creating a highly reflective image. There are multiple applications in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be useful. The most commonly used application is in the enhancement of LV endocardial borders for assessment of global and regional systolic function. Contrast may also be used to enhance visualization of wall thickening during stress echocardiography, for the assessment of LV thrombus, or for the assessment of other masses in the heart. Contrast echocardiography has also been used to assess blood perfusion throughout myocardium in the case of coronary artery disease.

==Accreditation==
Echocardiography can at many times be subjective, meaning that the person reading the echo may have personal input that affects the interpretation of the findings, leading to so-called &quot;inter-observer variability&quot;, where different echocardiographers might produce different reports when examining the same images. It necessitated the development of accreditation programs around the world. The aim of such programs is to standardize the practice of echocardiography and to ensure that practitioners have the proper training prior to practicing echocardiography which will eventually limit inter-observer variability.

===Europe===
At the European level individual and laboratory accreditation is provided by the European Association of Echocardiography (EAE). There are three subspecialties for individual accreditation: Adult Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), Adult Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) and Congenital Heart Disease Echocardiography (CHD).

===UK===
In the UK, accreditation is regulated by the British Society of Echocardiography. Accredited radiographers, sonographers, or other professionals are required to pass a mandatory exam.

===United States===
The &quot;Intersocietal Accreditation Commission for Echocardiography&quot; (IAC) sets standards for echo labs across the US. Cardiologists and sonographers who wish to have their laboratory accredited by IAC must comply with these standards. The purpose of accreditation is to maintain quality and consistency across echocardiography labs in the United States. Accreditation is offered in adult and pediatric transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, as well as adult stress and fetal echo. Accreditation is a two-part process. Each facility will conduct a detailed self-evaluation, paying close attention to the IAC Standards and Guidelines. The facility will then complete the application and submit actual case studies to the board of directors for review. Once all requirements have been met, the lab will receive certification. IAC certification is a continual process and must be maintained by the facility: it may include audits or site visits by the IAC. There are several states in which Medicare and/or private insurance carriers require accreditation (credentials) of the laboratory and/or sonographer for reimbursement of echocardiograms.

There are two credentialing bodies in the United States for sonographers, the &quot;Cardiovascular Credentialing International&quot; (CCI), established in 1968, and the &quot;American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography&quot; (ARDMS), established in 1975. Both CCI and ARDMS have earned the prestigious &quot;ANSI-ISO 17024&quot; accreditation for certifying bodies from the International Organization for Standardization (&quot;ISO&quot;). Accreditation is granted through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Recognition of ARDMS programs in providing credentials has also earned the ARDMS accreditation with the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). The NCCA is the accrediting arm of the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA).

Under both credentialing bodies, sonographers must first document completion of prerequisite requirements, which contain both didactic and hands-on experience in the field of ultrasound. Applicants must then take a comprehensive exam demonstrating knowledge in both the physics of ultrasound and the clinical competency related to their specialty. Credentialed sonographers are then required to maintain competency in their field by obtaining a certain number of Continuing Medical Education credits, or CME&#x27;s.

In 2009, New Mexico and Oregon became the first two states to require licensure of sonographers.

The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) is a professional organization made up of physicians, sonographers, nurses, and scientists involved in the field of echocardiography. One of the most important roles that the ASE plays is providing their recommendations through the ASE Guidelines and Standards, providing resource and educational opportunities for sonographers and physicians in the field.

There have been various institutes who are working on use of Artificial intelligence in Echo but they are at a very early stage and still needs full development.

<text>The Christian Community is a liberal and esoterically-oriented Christian denomination established in Germany in 1922 by Lutheran ministers influenced by Anthroposophy. As of 2023, it claims approximately 100,000 members in more than 400 congregations.

==History==

During the early growth of the Anthroposophical Society, some Lutheran pastors in Germany appealed to Rudolf Steiner for a system of worship oriented towards his concept of Jesus Christ as the first fully initiated human in history, possessing absolute consciousness of the spiritual realm. According to a founding member of the Christian Community, Friedrich Rittelmeyer, he and the other founders were inspired by Steiner.

In 1939 in London, Evelyn Capel became the first English woman priest of The Christian Community to celebrate the sacraments. After World War II, she helped reestablish Christian Community congregations in Germany, as well as expand its foothold to South Africa.

In Nazi Germany, The Christian Community came under state surveillance, however, &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of Church Affairs Hanns Kerrl opposed an outright ban on the group. Despite Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s misgivings about the church, police reports consistently found nothing objectionable about its activities or practices and new congregations were established in Cologne and Stuttgart between 1938 and 1939. Nonetheless, following the departure of Rudolf Hess for Britain in 1941, a national purge against perceived occult tendencies was initiated, the Christian Community banned, and its leader Emil Bock imprisoned due to the community&#x27;s alleged &quot;Masonic activities&quot;. 

The first Christian Community congregation in the United States was established in New York in 1948.

==Beliefs==
According to James B. Robinson, a professor of religious studies at the University of Northern Iowa, the Christian Community &quot;emphasizes freedom of thought and reflection within the framework of Christian symbolism&quot;. Frank Hörtreiter, the organization&#x27;s public relations officer, has written that the &quot;Christian Community does not have any beliefs&quot;. Hörtreiter explains that the Christian Community relies on the New Testament for the conduct of its sacraments and as a source for use in sermons and discussions, but individual members develop and hold their own beliefs &quot;freely as convictions born out of their own experience&quot;.
Clergy are free to minister as they see fit and their sermons are understood to represent only their individual feelings and not the doctrine of the community or the congregation.

The Christian Community practices open communion.

==Organization==

The Christian Community has a modified congregational polity in which each congregation, of which there are approximately 200, is governed by its own members and is financially independent from the organization as a whole. Priests assemble at the national and international levels in synods and elect a coordinator from among their own number. The Christian Community is globally headed by the Erzoberlenker, a priest whose office is located in Stuttgart, Germany.

The Christian Community&#x27;s clergy, referred to as priests, are ordained by national synods upon completion of six months of instruction in one of its three seminaries, followed by an internship with an active priest in a congregation. Both men and women are ordained. The Christian Community does not claim Apostolic succession.

===Ecumenical and external relations===
The Christian Community is one of several self-identifying Christian faiths, including Mormonism and the Salvation Army, whose baptisms are not considered valid by the Roman Catholic Church. The Evangelical Church in Germany also does not accept the Christian Community&#x27;s baptisms, however, neither does it deny its Christianity. A study commissioned by the World Council of Churches in 1950 recommended it be accepted into membership in the organization; its application was ultimately refused. The community itself states it operates &quot;without attachment to any existing church or ecumenical movement&quot;.

Many members of the Christian Community are also members of the Anthroposophical Society and there are informal ties between the two groups. However, it is a legally distinct organization.

<doc id="337623" wikidata="Q65917" url="?curid=337623" title="Wilhelm Pieck">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck (; 3 January 1876 – 7 September 1960) was a German communist politician who served as the chairman of the Socialist Unity Party from 1946 to 1950 and as the only president of the German Democratic Republic from 1949 until his death in 1960.

Pieck had been active in the SPD since the 1890s, breaking from the party in 1917 over his opposition to the First World War. He co-founded the Spartacus League and the KPD, rising to become chairman of the latter organization following the imprisonment of Ernst Thälmann and John Schehr by the Nazis. After the end of the Second World War, he played a key role in the 1946 merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which served as the ruling party of East Germany from 1949 until 1989.

==Provenance and early years==

Pieck was born into a Catholic family, as the son of the coachman Friedrich Pieck and his wife Auguste in the eastern part of Guben, in what was then the German Empire and is now Gubin, Poland. Two years later, his mother died. The father soon married the washerwoman Wilhelmine Bahro. After attending elementary school, the young Wilhelm completed a four-year carpentry apprenticeship. As a journeyman, he joined the German Timber Workers Association in 1894.

As a carpenter, in 1894 Pieck joined the wood-workers&#x27; federation, which steered him towards joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) the following year. Pieck became the chairman of the party urban district in 1899, and in 1906 became full-time secretary of the SPD. The same year, he was elected to the Bürgerschaft of Bremen. In 1914, he moved to a three-room apartment in Berlin-Steglitz. By now he had his own study with many shelves full of books. In May 1915, he was arrested at the big women&#x27;s demonstration in front of the Reichstag and kept in &quot;protective custody&quot; until October. As Bremen Party secretary in 1916, Pieck had asked Anton Pannekoek to continue teaching socialist theory in the party school. 

Although the majority of the SPD supported the German government in World War I, Pieck was a member of the party&#x27;s left wing, which opposed the war. Pieck&#x27;s openness in doing so led to his arrest and detention in a military prison. After being released, Pieck briefly lived in exile in Amsterdam. Upon his return to Berlin in 1918, Pieck joined the newly founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

==Weimar years==
On 16 January 1919 Pieck, along with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, was arrested in Berlin&#x27;s Wilmersdorf district and taken to the Eden Hotel. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were then killed while &quot;being taken to prison&quot; by a unit of Freikorps. While the two were being murdered, Pieck claimed that he managed to escape. Due to lingering suspicions about Pieck&#x27;s reported escape, KPD chairman Ernst Thälmann called Pieck before a party court chaired by Hans Kippenberger in 1929. The party court&#x27;s decision was never published and Kippenberger was executed in Moscow after a secret trial in 1937. According to Waldemar Pabst (the officer who gave the order to kill Liebknecht and Luxemburg), Pieck did not actually escape, but was released in return for providing details about the military plans and hiding places of other KPD members. 

In 1922, he became a founding member of the International Red Aid, serving first on the executive committee. In May 1925, he became the chairman of the Rote Hilfe.

Pieck held several elected offices in the Weimar Republic. He served in the Landtag of Prussia from 1921 to 1928 and again from 1932 to 1933, the Reichstag from 1928 to 1933, the Berlin City Council from 1929 to 1933, and the Prussian State Council from 1930 to 1932.

==Nazi years and Moscow exile==
On 4 March 1933, one day before the Reichstag election, Pieck&#x27;s family left their Steglitz apartment and moved into a cook&#x27;s room. His son and daughter had been in the Soviet Union since 1932 while Elly Winter was still in Germany. At the beginning of May 1933, he left first to Paris and then to Moscow. In Moscow, Pieck served the Communist Party in a variety of capacities. From 1935 until 1943, he held the position of Secretary of the Communist International. In 1943 Pieck was among the founders of the National Committee for a Free Germany, an anti-Nazi organisation created by the Soviets aimed at Germans.

On 22 June 1941, Pieck and his family were in their country house on the outskirts of Moscow. Pieck came downstairs at six o&#x27;clock to his children&#x27;s bedroom and said: &quot;Children, get up, it was announced on the radio that war is over. Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, but that will be the end&quot;. In March 1942, the family was able to return home after the Soviet Armed Forces won the Battle of Moscow.

==Soviet occupation zone==
At the conclusion of the war in 1945 Pieck returned to Germany with the victorious Red Army. A year later, he helped engineer the merger of the eastern branches of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party (SED). He was elected as the merged party&#x27;s co-chairman, alongside former SPD leader Otto Grotewohl. His hand appeared alongside Grotewohl&#x27;s on the SED&#x27;s &quot;handshake&quot; logo, derived from the SPD-KPD congress establishing the party where he symbolically shook hands with Grotewohl.

==President of East Germany==

In October 1949, the Soviet occupation zone became the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Pieck was elected president of the new country. He served as East Germany&#x27;s first (and last) president until his death in 1960.

Nominally, for the GDR&#x27;s first year, Pieck was the number-two man in the government behind Grotewohl, who became the new country&#x27;s first prime minister. In the East German political hierarchy, the prime minister was the top state official, while the president nominally ranked second. 

He lost the co-chairmanship of the ruling SED (which he held with Grotewohl) in 1950, when Walter Ulbricht became the party&#x27;s first secretary as the party restructured along more orthodox Soviet lines. Nonetheless, he retained his other posts, including the presidency, due to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s trust in him.

==Last years==

Pieck was already 73 years old at the time of his initial election as president. He nominally held the second highest state post in the GDR (behind Prime Minister Grotewohl) and served as SED co-chairman for the first four years of the party&#x27;s existence. He was also a member of the SED&#x27;s Politburo, the highest authority in the party. Despite this, he played a mostly minor role in the party, particularly after 1950.

On 13 July 1953, he suffered a second stroke. He also had progressive liver cirrhosis and existing ascites. A detailed medical report composed before the second stroke mentioned &quot;mild paralysis on the right, a slight drooping of the corner of the mouth, breathing wheezing or snoring, slowed down pulse, tone of the limb musculature lowered ...&quot;.

In August 1960 he moved to a new summer residence, the converted former mansion of the Hermann Göring Leibförsters near &quot;Karinhall&quot;.

Pieck died at Majakowskiring 29, Pankow, East Berlin. He was honoured with a state funeral, cremated and buried at the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery, Berlin.

==Personal life==
He was married to Christine Häfker, a garments worker whom he met in a large dance hall in Bremen. At first, her parents did not want her to go out with a &quot;red&quot;, but once she was pregnant, she was allowed to marry Wilhelm on 28 May 1898, on the condition that a traditional wedding in a church would still take place. On the wedding day Christine waited impatiently for Pieck to arrive at the church. At the last minute, he finally did, still carrying communist leaflets. In November 1936, his wife contracted pneumonia for the third time, dying on 1 December of the same year.

The Piecks&#x27; daughter, Elly Winter (1898–1987), held various posts in the SED and East German government. Their son Arthur Pieck (1899–1970) served as head of the East German national airline Interflug from 1955 to 1965, after having held various administrative posts in East Germany, for instance at the German Economic Commission. The youngest child, Eleonore Staimer (1906–1998), worked as a party official and, for a time, as a diplomat.

<doc id="337624" wikidata="Q6627580" url="?curid=337624" title="List of mayors of London, Ontario">
<text>The mayor of London is head of London City Council. The 65th and current mayor of the city is Josh Morgan. London was incorporated as a town in 1848, and became a city in 1855. Originally, mayors were elected on January 1 for one-year terms.

The following is a list of mayors of London:

==Chain of office==
Since 1957, each sitting mayor has been honoured and presented with the chain of office to wear during their term of office. The chain of office is to be worn by the mayor during council sessions and other official occasions, including opening and closing ceremonies such as London&#x27;s hosting of national and international sports and athletic competitions. The chain contains medallions engraved with subjects of local significance. The chain is also engraved with the names of the mayors who have worn it since it was commissioned. There are currently eleven names of previous mayors engraved on the chain.

==Town of London==


==City of London==
*

===2017 reform===
In spite of some controversy about this move, London was the first city in Canada (in May 2017) to decide to move a ranked choice ballot for municipal elections starting in 2018. Voters will mark their ballots in order of preference, ranking their top three favourite candidates. An individual must reach 50 per cent of the total to be declared elected; in each round of counting where a candidate has not yet reached that target, the person with the fewest votes is dropped from the ballot and their second or third choice preferences reallocated to the remaining candidates, with this process repeating until a candidate has reached 50 per cent.

<text>Noriyuki &quot;Pat&quot; Morita (June 28, 1932 – November 24, 2005) was an American actor and comedian. He began his career as a stand-up comedian, before becoming known to television audiences for his recurring role as diner owner Matsuo &quot;Arnold&quot; Takahashi on the sitcom series &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1975–83). He was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of martial arts mentor Mr. Miyagi in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), which would be the first of a media franchise in which Morita was the central player.

Morita was the series lead actor in the television program &quot;Mr. T and Tina&quot; and in &quot;Ohara&quot;, a police-themed drama. The two shows made history for being among the few TV shows with an Asian-American series lead. He also played recurring or featured roles as Captain Sam Pak on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Ah Chew in &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, and Mike Woo on &quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot;. He was the voice of The Emperor of China in the Disney animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), and its sequel &quot;Mulan II&quot; (2004).

Aside from his 1985 Oscar nod, Pat Morita was twice nominated for Golden Globe Awards (Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for the made-for-television film &quot;Amos&quot;), and an Emmy Award. In 1994, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry. In 2015, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Morita was born on June 28, 1932, in Isleton, California, to Japanese immigrant parents. Morita&#x27;s father, Tamaru, born in 1897, immigrated to California from Kumamoto Prefecture on the Japanese island of Kyushu in 1915. Tamaru&#x27;s wife, Momoe, born in 1903, immigrated to California in 1913. Noriyuki, as Pat was named, had a brother named Hideo (Harry) who was twelve years older.

Morita developed spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease) at the age of two and spent the bulk of the next nine years in the Weimar Institute in Weimar, California, and later at the Shriners Hospital in San Francisco. For long periods, he was wrapped in a full-body cast, and he was told that he would never walk. During his time at a sanatorium near Sacramento, Morita befriended a visiting priest who would often joke that, if Morita ever converted to Catholicism, the priest would rename him to &quot;Patrick Aloysius Ignatius Xavier Noriyuki Morita.&quot; Released from the hospital at age 11 after undergoing extensive spinal surgery and learning how to walk, Morita was transported from the hospital directly to the Gila River camp in Arizona to join his interned family. After about a year and a half, he was transferred to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center.

After World War II ended, Morita moved back to the Bay Area and he graduated from Armijo High School in Fairfield, California, in 1949. For a time after the war, the family operated Ariake Chop Suey, a restaurant in Sacramento, California, jokingly described by Morita years later as &quot;a Japanese family running a Chinese restaurant in a black neighborhood with a clientele of blacks, Filipinos and everybody else who didn&#x27;t fit in any of the other neighborhoods&quot;. Morita would entertain customers with jokes and serve as master of ceremonies for group dinners. After Morita&#x27;s father was killed in 1956 in a hit-and-run while walking home from an all-night movie, Morita and his mother kept the restaurant going for another three or four years. Needing a regular job to support his wife and a newly born child, Morita became a data processor in the early 1960s with the Department of Motor Vehicles and other state agencies, graduating to a graveyard shift job at Aerojet General. In due time, he was a department head at another aerospace firm, Lockheed, handling the liaison between the engineers and the programmers who were mapping out lunar eclipses for Polaris and Titan missile projects.

However, Morita suffered from occupational burnout and decided to quit his job and try show business. He began working as a stand-up comedian at small clubs in Sacramento as well as San Francisco, taking the stage name &quot;Pat Morita,&quot; in part due to the presence of comedians including Pat Henry and Pat Cooper, in addition due to memories of the priest he had befriended as a boy. Morita struggled for many years in comedy, until fellow performer—ventriloquist Hank Garcia—told him to try his luck in Los Angeles. Sally Marr, Lenny Bruce&#x27;s mother, acted as his agent and manager after he moved to Los Angeles, and booked him in the San Fernando Valley and at the Horn nightclub in Santa Monica. Morita sometimes worked as the opening act for singers Vic Damone and Connie Stevens and for his mentor, the comedian Redd Foxx. Morita used the nickname &quot;The Hip Nip&quot;.

==Television and movie career==

===Early work===
Morita&#x27;s first movie roles were as a henchman in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967) and a similar role in &quot;The Shakiest Gun in the West&quot; (1968), starring Don Knotts. Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh In (1968 Season 1 Episode 8) Morita had appearances in different skits on the show. Morita had other notable recurring television roles on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; (1974–1976) as Ah Chew, a good-natured friend of Lamont Sanford, and as South Korean Army Captain Sam Pak on the sitcom &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1973, 1974). He was also cast as Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka in the war film &quot;Midway&quot; (1976).

===&quot;Happy Days&quot;===
Morita had a recurring role in the mid-1970&#x27;s on &quot;Happy Days&quot; as Matsuo &quot;Arnold&quot; Takahashi (the new Japanese owner of Arnold&#x27;s Drive-In) commencing in season three (1975–76). The story line was that Takahashi had purchased the Milwaukee eatery from the original Arnold but adopted the former&#x27;s first name, explaining that it was too expensive for him to purchase the additional neon sign letters required to rename it &quot;Takahashi&#x27;s&quot;. As the new owner, he moonlighted as a martial arts instructor, teaching self-defense classes at the drive-in after hours. Morita also portrayed &quot;Arnold&quot; as a guest star during seasons four and six before returning as a recurring character for season ten and as a main character in the final eleventh season. He also portrayed the character of Arnold on &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties&quot; in 1977.

===&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; film series===
Morita gained particular fame during the 1980s for his work as Mr. Miyagi in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films. The original preferred choice was Toshiro Mifune, who had appeared in the Akira Kurosawa films &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958), but the actor did not speak English. Morita later auditioned for the role, but was initially rejected for the part due to his close association with stand-up comedy, and with the character Arnold from &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Producer Jerry Weintraub in particular did not want Morita, as he saw him as a comedic actor. Morita eventually tested five times before Weintraub himself offered him the role, ultimately winning it because he grew a beard and patterned his accent after his uncle. After he was cast and although he had been using the name Pat for years, Weintraub suggested that he be billed with his given name to sound &quot;more ethnic&quot;.

In the first film, in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a corresponding Golden Globe Award, for his role as the wise karate teacher Mr. Miyagi who taught bullied teenager Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) the art of Goju-ryu karate. He was recognized as Noriyuki &quot;Pat&quot; Morita at the 57th Academy Awards ceremony. He reprised the role two more times with Macchio in &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989). In 1994, he starred in &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; with Hilary Swank (as bullied teenager Julie Pierce) instead of Macchio.

===Television series===
Morita was the star of two television series. In 1976, he starred as inventor Taro Takahashi in his own show, &quot;Mr. T and Tina&quot;, the first Asian-American sitcom on network TV. The sitcom was placed on Saturday nights by ABC and was quickly canceled after a month in the fall of 1976. He also starred in the ABC detective show &quot;Ohara&quot; (1987–1988); it was cancelled after two seasons due to poor ratings.

===Later work===

Morita went on to play Tommy Tanaka in the Kirk Douglas-starring television movie &quot;Amos&quot;, receiving his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination and second Golden Globe Award nomination for the role.

He wrote and starred in the World War II romance film &quot;Captive Hearts&quot; (1987). He hosted the educational home video series &quot;Britannica&#x27;s Tales Around the World&quot; (1990–1991). He made an appearance on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; in the 1994 Season 5 episode “Love Hurts”. Later in his career he starred on the Nickelodeon television series &quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot; (1996–1998), and had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;The Hughleys&quot; (2000). He also made a guest appearance on a 1996 episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. He went on to star in the short film &quot;Talk To Taka&quot; as a sushi chef who doles out advice to anyone who will hear him. He voiced the Emperor of China in Disney&#x27;s 36th animated feature &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and reprised the role in &quot;Mulan II&quot; (2004), a direct-to-video sequel and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. 

He spoofed his role as &quot;Mr. Miyagi&quot; in a series of commercials for Colgate toothpaste; he portrayed the white-clad Wisdom Tooth, hailing Colgate as &quot;The Wise Choice&quot;. He also co-starred with Ichiro Suzuki in a 1996 Nissan commercial aired in Japan.

He had a cameo appearance in the 2001 Alien Ant Farm music video &quot;Movies&quot;. His appearance in the video spoofed his role in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. In 2002, he made a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Spy TV&quot;. In 2003, he had a cameo on an episode of the sitcom &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;, as an unnamed karate teacher, potentially being Miyagi. He would also reprise his role (to an extent) in the stop-motion animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in 2005.

==Death==
Pat Morita died of kidney failure, following a urinary tract and gallbladder bacterial infection, on November 24, 2005, at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 73. Throughout his life, Morita had battled alcoholism.
He was cremated at Palm Green Valley Mortuary and Cemetery in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Posthumous credits==
Roles created prior to his death were included in a few posthumous works. He voiced Master Udon in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Karate Island&quot; (the episode was dedicated to his memory). He had a role in the independent feature film &quot;Only the Brave&quot; (2006), about the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, where he plays the father of lead actor (and director) Lane Nishikawa (the film included two other &quot;Karate Kid&quot; stars, Yuji Okumoto and Tamlyn Tomita). He also had roles in &quot;Act Your Age (2011)&quot;, &quot;Royal Kill&quot; (2009), and &quot;Remove All Obstacles&quot; (2010).

The fifth episode of the Netflix series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; was dedicated in his memory. In-universe, Mr. Miyagi died on November 15, 2011, but is frequently referenced via archive footage from the original films.

Morita&#x27;s contributions to cinema and his legacy have been the subject of two documentaries including &quot;Pat Morita: Long Story Short&quot; and &quot;More Than Miyagi: The Pat Morita Story&quot; in which he appeared in archival footage&quot;.&quot;

<text>The following is an Eastern Armenian verb table. The Western Armenian verb table can be found here.

==Conjugations==

===Affirmative/Interrogative===

====Type I/II====

(This conjugation is termed &quot;I/II&quot; to coincide with historic/Western numbering, where there are still three distinct conjugations)

Note that traditional Armenian grammars use Aorist for Preterite and Optative for Subjunctive. In Armenian, gerunds / gerundives / converbs (verbal noun) are interchangeable with an English relative clause. For example,

նամակ գրող մարդը &quot;namak groġ mardə&quot; - The man who is writing a letter / The man writing a letter (there is only a present tense gerund in English)

նամակ գրած մարդը &quot;namak grac mardə&quot; - The man who has written a letter

մարդու գրելիք նամակը &quot;mardu grelik’ namakə&quot; - The letter that the man will write (roughly, &quot;the man&#x27;s will-be written letter&quot;)

Additionally, the synchronical gerund or present participle II denotes a simultaneous action. In other words, a concurrency between two verbs:

Ես վազելիս ընկա &quot;yes vazelis ənka&quot; - I fell while running

Note: the Conditional mood is sometimes labeled the Hypothetical mood; in the Necessative, պետք է &quot;petk’ ē&quot; is used as a stronger form of պիտի &quot;piti&quot;; and that resultive constructions are not moods. They convey a state as a result from a prior action. Compare:

նստում եմ &quot;nstum em,&quot; I am sitting down, and նստած եմ &quot;nstac em&quot;, I am sitting.

կառուցվում է &quot;kaṙuc’voum ē&quot;, it is getting built, and կառուցված է &quot;kaṙuc’vac ē&quot;, it is built. 
====Type III====

(This conjugation is termed &quot;III&quot; (instead of &quot;II&quot;) to coincide with historic/Western numbering, where there are still three distinct conjugations)
===Negative===

====Type I====

Note: the formation of the negative is the same for all conjugations. The examples below are based on the first conjugation.
Note: the negative jussive forms may also be (in Eastern Armenian) &quot;ch&#x27;piti sirem, ch&#x27;piti sires, etc; ch&#x27;piti sirei, ch&#x27;piti sireir, etc&quot;.</text><links>

<text>Thomas Murner, OFM (24 December 1475c. 1537) was an Alsatian satirist, poet and translator.

== Early life and education ==
He was born at Oberehnheim (Obernai) near Strasbourg. In 1490 he entered the Franciscan order, and in 1495 began travelling, studying and then teaching and preaching in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Paris, Cracow and Strasbourg itself. The emperor Maximilian I crowned him in 1505 &quot;poeta laureatus&quot;; in 1506, he was created &quot;doctor theologiae.&quot; In 1508, while a preacher of the St.Martin church in Freiburg, he defied a recently died and relative of Ulrich Zasius as well as the scribe of Freiburg. Since, both shall have let Murner know of their enmity. In 1513 was appointed custodian of the Franciscan monastery in Strasbourg, an office which he was forced to vacate the following year for having published a scurrilous book. 

== Professional career ==
In 1518, he began the study of jurisprudence at the University of Basel, and in 1519 took the degree of &quot;doctor juris&quot;. Zasius tried to prevent his graduation appealing to the professor of the University Claudius Catiuncula, but without success. In jurisprudence, Murner focused on the Institutes of Justinian and their translation in the german language from latin. He hoped that in their native language, the students would have a better understanding of the jurisprudence before often learned from books in a foreign language. In October 1518 his book &quot;Utriusque iuris Tituli et Regule&quot; was published by Adam Petri in Basel which still included most of the text still in both languages, Latin and German. In April 1519, he published the &quot;Instituten in warer ursprung&quot;, where the foreword and text were held in the german language and the chapters printed in latin. But also the chapters counted with a translation into the german language. 

In the summer of 1523, at the invitation of Henry VIII, he went to the Kingdom of England, where his writings had caught the attention of Thomas More.

John Headley credits Murner for making More aware of the radical nature of Martin Luther&#x27;s ecclesiology. Henry VIII felt that Murner was an important orthodox influence in Strasbourg and gave him £100 and a letter to the city magistrates.

After this stay, and a journey to Italy, he again settled in Strasbourg, but, disturbed by the Protestant Reformation, went into exile at Lucerne in Switzerland in 1526. In 1533 he was appointed priest of Oberehnheim, where he died in 1537, or, according to some accounts, in 1536.

Murner was an energetic and passionate character, but made enemies wherever he went. There is little human kindness in his satires, which were directed against the corruption of the times, the Reformation, and especially against Martin Luther. His most powerful satire—the most virulent German satire of the period—is &quot;Von dem grossen Lutherischen Narren wie ihn Doctor Murner beschworen hat&quot; (&quot;On the Great Lutheran Fool&quot;, 1522). Others included &quot;Die Narrenbeschwörung&quot; (1512); &quot;Die Schelmenzunft&quot; (1512); &quot;Die Gäuchmatt&quot;, which treats of enamoured fools (1519), and a translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (1515) dedicated to the emperor Maximilian I. Murner also wrote the humorous &quot;Chartiludium logicae&quot; for the teaching of logic (1507) and the &quot;Ludus studentum Friburgensium&quot; (1511), besides a translation of Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Institutiones&quot; (1519).

Murner&#x27;s satires were edited in the 1840s by Johann Scheible.

<text>(Helen) Hope Mirrlees (8 April 1887 – 1 August 1978) was a British poet, novelist and translator. She is best known for the 1926 &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot;, an influential fantasy novel, and for &quot;&quot; (1920)&quot;,&quot; an experimental poem published by Virginia and Leonard Woolf&#x27;s Hogarth Press, which critic Julia Briggs deemed &quot;modernism&#x27;s lost masterpiece, a work of extraordinary energy and intensity, scope and ambition.&quot;

==Biography==
Helen Hope Mirrlees was born in Chislehurst, Kent, and raised in Scotland and South Africa. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before going up to Newnham College, Cambridge to study Greek. While at Cambridge, Mirrlees developed a close relationship with the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison, Mirrlees&#x27; tutor and later her friend and collaborator.

Mirrlees and Harrison lived together from 1913 until the latter&#x27;s death in 1928. Although they divided their time mainly between the United Kingdom and France, often returning to Paris to continue Harrison&#x27;s medical treatments, their travels also took them to other European countries. Both of them studied Russian, Mirrlees earning a Diploma in Russian from the École des Langues Orientales of Paris, and went on to collaborate on translations from the Russian. Mirrlees and Harrison visited Spain in 1920, and there took Spanish lessons.

After Harrison&#x27;s death, Mirrlees converted to Catholicism. In 1948, Mirrlees moved to South Africa and remained there until 1963, when the first volume of her &quot;extravagant biography&quot; of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton was published (the second volume is unpublished). Two volumes of poetry, &quot;Poems&quot; and &quot;Moods and Tensions&quot;, were also privately published.

Mirrlees was a friend of Virginia Woolf, who described her in a letter as &quot;her own heroine – capricious, exacting, exquisite, very learned, and beautifully dressed.&quot; Her circle of celebrity friends also included T. S. Eliot; Gertrude Stein, who mentions Mirrlees in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Autobiography&quot;; Bertrand Russell; and Ottoline Morrell.

Mirrlees died in Thames Bank, Goring, England, in 1978, aged 91.

==Writing==

Mirrlees&#x27; 600-line modernist poem, &quot;Paris: A Poem&quot;, published in 1920 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Hogarth Press, is the subject of increasing attention by scholars of modernism, inspired by Julia Briggs&#x27;s considerable study, and is considered by some to have had an influence on the work of her friend, T. S. Eliot, and on that of Virginia Woolf.

Mirrlees set her first novel, &quot;Madeleine: One of Love&#x27;s Jansenists&quot; (1919), in and around the literary circles of the 17th Century Précieuses, and particularly those salons frequented by Mlle de Scudéry. Mirrlees later used medieval Spanish culture as part of the background of her second novel, &quot;The Counterplot&quot; (1924).

&quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; was reprinted in 1970 in mass-market paperback format by Lin Carter, without the author&#x27;s permission, for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, and then again by Del Rey in 1977. The &quot;unauthorised&quot; nature of the 1970 reprint is explained by the fact that, as Carter indicated in his introduction, he and the publishing company could not even ascertain whether the author was alive or dead, &quot;since our efforts to trace this lady [Mirrlees] have so far been unsuccessful.&quot;

Since 2000, Mirrlees&#x27; work has undergone another resurgence in popularity, marked by new editions of her poetry, an entry in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; and several scholarly essays by critic Julia Briggs, new introductions to &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; by writer Neil Gaiman and scholar Douglas A. Anderson, essays and a brief biography by writer Michael Swanwick, an artist-book facsimile reprint of &quot;Paris, a poem&quot; by printer and publisher Hurst Street Press, and translations of &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; into German and Spanish.

Joanna Russ wrote a short story, &quot;The Zanzibar Cat&quot; (1971), in homage to Hope Mirrlees and as a critique of &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; – and indeed the entire genre of fantasy, describing Fairyland &quot;half in affectionate parody, but the other half very seriously indeed&quot;.

&quot;Hope-in-the-Mist&quot;, a book-length study of Mirrlees and her work by Michael Swanwick, was published by Temporary Culture in 2009.

&quot;The Collected Poems of Hope Mirrlees&quot; was published by Fyfield Books (Carcanet Press) in 2011 (edited by Sandeep Parmar). It includes previously unpublished poems, the full text of &quot;Paris&quot;, her later poems and prose essays from the 1920s. Sandeep Parmar is currently writing a biography of Mirrlees as well. She also features in the group biography &quot;Square Haunting&quot; by Francesca Wade (2020).

<text>Raymond Clarence Ewry (October 14, 1873 – September 29, 1937) was an American track and field athlete who won eight gold medals at the Olympic Games and two gold medals at the Intercalated Games (1906 in Athens). This puts him among the most successful Olympians of all time.

==Personal life and early career==
Ewry was born in Lafayette, Indiana, and contracted polio as a young boy. In his childhood, he used a wheelchair, and it was feared that he might become paralysed for life.

However, Ewry did his own exercises and overcame his illness. Ewry attended Purdue University in 1890–1897, where he captained the track and field team, played American football, and became a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. After receiving a graduate degree in mechanical engineering at Purdue, he moved to New York. There he worked as a hydraulics engineer and became a member of the New York Athletic Club. He specialized in now defunct events, the standing jumps: the standing high jump, the standing long jump and the standing triple jump. These events were similar to their modern, normal versions but the athlete jumped without a run-up.

==Career==
Ewry proved to be the best standing jumper in the world. At his first Olympics, held in Paris (1900), he won gold medals in all three standing jumps. Incidentally, all three finals were held on the same day (July 16).

At the 1904 Summer Olympics, Ewry successfully defended all three of his titles. The standing triple jump event was discontinued after those Olympics, but Ewry continued to dominate the two remaining standing jump events at both the 1906 Intercalated Games and 1908 Games, thus bringing his total to 10 Olympic gold titles including two from the Intercalated Games, the highest number achieved until 2008. The 1906 Intercalated Games are currently not officially recognised by the IOC, although they were organized as an Olympic event by the IOC. Even if the 1906 games are removed from his totals, he stands () as the 12th most successful Olympian of all time in terms of total individual medals and second most successful in terms of individual gold medals. The standing jumping events were no longer held in the Olympics after 1912.

Ewry&#x27;s superiority is also displayed by the fact that his world record in the standing long jump () was still standing when the event was discontinued internationally in the 1930s. In 1974 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and in 1983 into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Longstanding records for Olympic medals==
Ewry&#x27;s eight Olympic gold medals in individual events (i.e. non-relay), although now second to Michael Phelps&#x27;s 13, was the record, all alone, for 100 years and 23 days—from July 23, 1908, until Phelps won &quot;his&quot; eighth on August 15, 2008 (followed by his ninth on August 16).

His record of winning three gold medals in &quot;one event&quot;, although it had subsequently been equaled by seven other athletes, was not surpassed for 60 years—from 1908 until Al Oerter won his &quot;fourth&quot; gold (discus throw) in 1968, a feat equaled by Carl Lewis when he won his fourth (long jump) in 1996, Michael Phelps when he won his fourth (200 meter individual medley) in 2016, and by Kaori Icho when she won her fourth consecutive gold in women&#x27;s wrestling in 2016.

Finally, his record of three gold medals in &quot;two&quot; events, set in July 1908 (standing long jump on July 20 and standing high jump on July 23) was not surpassed for 108 years—until in 2016 Michael Phelps won his third gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly to win three gold medals in three events (200-meter individual medley, 100-meter butterfly, and 200-meter butterfly). Phelps equaled Ewry&#x27;s record in 2012, when he won his third gold in the 100 meter butterfly on August 3, having won his third in the 200-meter individual medley on August 2.

Ewry is currently tied with Caeleb Dressel for the most Olympic medals with a 100% record—8 individual golds.

<text>Snuff is a 1976 splatter film directed by Michael Findlay and Horacio Fredriksson. Originally an exploitation film loosely based on the 1969 murders committed by the Manson Family, it is most notorious for being falsely marketed as if it were an actual snuff film. The controversy about the film was deliberately manufactured to attract publicity: it prompted an investigation by the New York County District Attorney, who determined that the murder shown in the film was fake. This picture contributed to the urban legend of snuff films, although the concept did not originate with it.

==Plot==

Actress Terry London (played by Mirta Massa) and her producer, Max Marsh, visit an unnamed country in South America. A female biker cult led by a man named Satán () stalks and eventually murders the pregnant London and her circle of friends.

In the film&#x27;s last minutes, the action is interrupted as the camera pulls out to show the crew shooting the scene: the director is then seen flirting with a female crew member. They start kissing, with the crew filming them. The director suddenly assaults the woman and proceeds to torture, kill, and disembowel her as the crew assists him and keeps filming. The film then ends with the camera running out of stock.

==Cast==
* Margarita Amuchástegui as Angelica
* Ana Carro as Ana
* Liliana Fernández Blanco as Susanna
* Roberta Findlay as Carmela (voice)
* as Horst&#x27;s father
* Enrique Larratelli as Satán
* Mirta Massa as Terry London
* as Max Marsh
* Clao Villanueva as Horst Frank
* Michael Findlay as Detective 
* Brian Cary as film director (additional footage)
* Tina Austin as script girl (additional footage)

==Production==
The film started out as a low-budget exploitation film titled &quot;Slaughter&quot; made by the husband-and-wife filmmaking team of Michael and Roberta Findlay. Filmed in Argentina in 1971 on a budget of $30,000, it depicted the actions of a Manson-esque murder cult, and was shot mainly without sound due to most of the actors speaking little or no English. The film&#x27;s financier, Jack Bravman, took an out-of-court settlement from American International Pictures to allow it to use the title &quot;Slaughter&quot; for its Blaxploitation film starring Jim Brown. Some sources state that the Findlays&#x27; film received an extremely limited theatrical release, while others indicate it was never screened theatrically at all under its original title.

In any event, independent low-budget distributor and producer Allan Shackleton, who specialized in sexploitation movies, bought the distribution rights for the film. In 1975, after reading a newspaper article on the rumor of snuff films produced in South America, Shackleton saw an opportunity to cash in on the urban legend by adding a new ending to &quot;Slaughter&quot;. Shackleton began to advertise the film in December 1975 through press releases. When Michael Findlay realized that it was his own film being promoted under the new title &quot;Snuff&quot;, he tried to renegotiate the contract with the distributor, but eventually failed to secure more money from Shackleton. The filmmaker hired to shoot the additional footage was Simon Nuchtern, who directed a new ending in vérité style, in which a woman is brutally murdered and dismembered by a film crew, supposedly the crew of &quot;Slaughter&quot;.

The new footage, shot over one day in Carter Stevens&#x27;s adult film studio, was spliced onto the end of &quot;Slaughter&quot; with an abrupt cut suggesting that the footage was unplanned. This subtle, yet impactful cut only further supported viewers thoughts that the murder being depicted was truly “authentic.” However, no one seemed to notice that the cast and scenery in Nuchtern&#x27;s ending had no resemblance or similarities with those appearing in Findlay&#x27;s original footage. The publicity material implied that the film featured an actual murder, without stating it outright: &quot;Snuff&quot; was released with the tagline &quot;The film that could only be made in South America... where Life is CHEAP!&quot; To further increase the air of mystery surrounding the films production, Shackleton decided to remove all other credits from the film.

==Controversy==
As a publicity stunt, Shackleton reportedly hired fake protesters to picket movie theaters showing the film. According to his associate Carter Stevens, Shackleton was surprised when genuine protesters also started picketing the theaters. Shackleton&#x27;s efforts succeeded in generating a media frenzy around the film, with media commentators and citizen groups condemning the film without having actually seen it. Although the film was exposed as a hoax in &quot;Variety&quot; shortly after its release, it became popular in New York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Boston.

The Adult Film Association of America (AFAA), of which Shackleton was a member, took pains to avoid any association with &quot;Snuff&quot;, as the snuff movies urban legend included rumors that the sex industry was involved in those films. The AFAA expelled Shackleton, then later announced that affiliated adult movie theaters would not show the picture (which was being shown in mainstream theaters and not in adult ones), and called a press conference to insist that the film was a hoax.

Rumors persisted that the film showed a real-life murder. Throughout &quot;Snuff&quot;&#x27;s theatrical run, Shackleton remained purportedly ambiguous about the nature of the film. When interviewed by &quot;Variety&quot;, he stated: &quot;[If the murder is real], I&#x27;d be a fool to admit it. If it isn&#x27;t real, I&#x27;d be a fool to admit it.”

Prompted by &quot;complaints and petitions from well-known writers, including Eric Bentley and Susan Brownmiller, and legislators,” New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau conducted a month-long investigation into the circumstances surrounding the film&#x27;s production. Morgenthau ultimately dismissed the supposedly &quot;real&quot; murder as &quot;nothing more than conventional trick photography—as is evident to anyone who sees the movie.” Morgenthau reassured the public that the actress apparently being dismembered and killed in the ending of the film had been traced by the police and was &quot;alive and well.” He also found no basis for criminal prosecution related to pornography statutes, or to consumer fraud laws in regard to the film&#x27;s advertising. However, Morgenthau stated that he had been &quot;concerned about the fact that this kind of a film might incite or encourage people to commit violence against women.”

==Release==
===Theatrical release===
Upon its release at the National Theatre in New York City with a $4 ticket price, &quot;Snuff&quot; grossed $66,456 in its first week. In New York, it outgrossed &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; for three consecutive weeks.

During its theatrical run, feminist groups kept protesting &quot;Snuff&quot;, which influenced city officials in Santa Clara, Philadelphia and St Paul to force theaters to stop showing the film. Twenty women protested the film&#x27;s return engagement in Rochester, New York at the Holiday Ciné: four of those protesters were arrested after breaking the poster frame to destroy the film&#x27;s poster. A theater owner in Monticello was prosecuted on obscenity charges. In most places, however, the protests failed to stop the theaters from showing the movie.

===Home media===
In the United Kingdom, the film was released on VHS by Astra Video in 1982, coinciding with the start of the video nasty controversy. The cover blurb read &quot;The original legendary atrocity shot and banned in New York&quot; and claimed that &quot;The actors and actresses who dedicated their lives to making this film were never seen or heard from again&quot;. The cover also credited &quot;T. Amazzo&quot; (a play on the Italian phrase &quot;Ti ammazzo&quot;, meaning &quot;I kill you&quot;) as director. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an outraged article about the film, which Astra Video eventually pulled from distribution once it had benefited from the publicity.

The film was released on DVD by Blue Underground on July 29, 2003. Blue Underground later released the film on DVD Special edition and for the first time on Blu-ray on October 22, 2013. It was last released by Cheezy Flicks on March 13, 2018.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Snuff&quot; was panned by critics at the time of its original release, both for the disingenuous publicity surrounding it and for its overall quality. Richard Eder of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a horrendously written, photographed, acted, directed and dubbed bit of verdigris showing a group of devil-girls massacring people.&quot; Also in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, John Leonard reported that &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; could have improved on the film&#x27;s special effects and that the final &quot;murder&quot; was less &quot;obnoxious&quot; than a similar scene from &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot;.

Later reviews were equally negative. Joel Harley from &quot;HorrorNews.net&quot; wrote in his review of the film, &quot;Were it not for that ending and the furore surrounding it, &quot;Snuff&quot; would surely have been forgotten a long time ago. Beyond the infamy, it&#x27;s a stultifyingly average film.&quot; Bill Gibron from &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the film 3/10 stars, writing, &quot;Unlike modern gorefests which strive for autopsy like realism in all facets of the F/X, &quot;Snuff&quot; is cheap and cheesy. While it[s] legend lives on, its realities end any speculation or scandal for that matter. No one really dies onscreen during the last few minutes of this movie. Your sense of gullibility, on the other hand...&quot; Adam Tyner from DVD Talk called the film &quot;basically unwatchable in its original form&quot;. Tyner criticized the film&#x27;s unnecessarily dragged out scenes, lack of tension, and dubbed dialogue, which he called &quot;sleepy, flat, lifeless, and howlingly inept all around, never even making an attempt to match any frantically flapping lips&quot;.

<text>Sati or suttee is a practice, a chiefly historical one, in which a Hindu widow burns alive on her deceased husband&#x27;s funeral pyre, the death by burning entered into voluntarily, by coercion, or by a perception of the lack of satisfactory options for continuing to live. Although it is debated whether it received scriptural mention in early Hinduism, it has been linked to related Hindu practices in the Indo-Aryan-speaking regions of India, which have diminished the rights of women, especially those to the inheritance of property. A cold form of sati, or the neglect and casting out of Hindu widows, has been prevalent from ancient times. Greek sources from around make isolated mention of sati, but it probably developed into a real fire sacrifice in the medieval era within northwestern Rajput clans to which it initially remained limited, to become more widespread during the late medieval era.

During the early-modern Mughal period of 1526–1857, sati was notably associated with elite Hindu Rajput clans in western India, marking one of the points of divergence between Hindu Rajputs and the Muslim Mughals, who banned the practice. In the early 19th century, the British East India Company, in the process of extending its rule to most of India, initially tried to stop the innocent killing; William Carey, a British Christian evangelist, noted 438 incidents within a 30-mile (48-km) radius of the capital, Calcutta, in 1803, despite its ban within Calcutta. Between 1815 and 1818 the number of incidents of sati in Bengal Presidency doubled from 378 to 839. Opposition to the practice of sati by evangelists like Carey, and by Hindu reformers such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy ultimately led the British Governor-General of India Lord William Bentinck to enact the Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829, declaring the practice of burning or burying alive of Hindu widows to be punishable by the criminal courts. Other legislation followed, countering what the British perceived to be interrelated issues involving violence against Hindu women, including the Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870, and Age of Consent Act, 1891.

Isolated incidents of sati were recorded in India in the late-20th century, leading the Government of India to promulgate the Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, criminalising the aiding or glorifying of sati. The modern laws have proved difficult to implement; as of 2020, at least 250 sati temples existed in India in which prayer ceremonies, or &quot;pujas&quot;, were performed to glorify the avatar of a mother goddess who immolated herself after hearing her father insult her husband; prayers were also performed to the practice of a wife immolating herself alive on a deceased husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. Bride burning is a related social and criminal issue seen from the early 20th century onwards, involving the deaths of women in India by accidental fires, the numbers of which far overshadow similar incidents involving men.

== Etymology and usage ==
The practice is named after the Hindu goddess Sati, who is believed to have self-immolated because she was unable to bear her father Daksha&#x27;s humiliation of her and her husband Shiva. The term was originally interpreted as &#x27;chaste woman&#x27;. appears in Hindi and Sanskrit texts, where it is synonymous with &#x27;good wife&#x27;; the term &quot;suttee&quot; was commonly used by Anglo-Indian English writers. The word &quot;sati&quot;, therefore, originally referred to the woman, rather than the rite. Variants are:
* &quot;Sativrata&quot;, an uncommon and seldom used term, denotes the woman who makes a vow (&quot;vrata&quot;), to protect her husband while he is alive and then die with her husband.
* &quot;Satimata&quot; denotes a venerated widow who committed &quot;sati&quot;.

The rite itself had technical names:
* &quot;Sahagamana&quot; (&#x27;going with&#x27;) or &quot;sahamarana&quot; (&#x27;dying with&#x27;).
* &quot;Anvarohana&quot; (&#x27;ascension&#x27; to the pyre) is occasionally met, as well as &quot;satidaha&quot; as terms to designate the process.
* &quot;Satipratha&quot; is also, on occasion, used as a term signifying the custom of burning widows alive.

The Indian Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) defines &quot;sati&quot; as the act or rite itself.

The spelling &quot;suttee&quot; is a phonetic spelling using 19th-century English orthography. The &quot;satī&quot; transliteration uses the more modern ISO/IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration), the academic standard for writing the Sanskrit language with the Latin alphabet system.

==Origin and spread==
The origins and spread of the practice of sati are complex and much debated questions, without a general consensus. It has been speculated that rituals, such as widow sacrifice or widow burning, have prehistoric roots. The archaeologist Elena Efimovna Kuzmina has listed several parallels between the burial practices of the ancient Asiatic steppe Andronovo cultures () and the Vedic Age. She considers sati to be a largely symbolic double burial or a double cremation, a feature she argues is to be found in both cultures, with neither culture observing it strictly.

===Vedic symbolic practice===
According to Romila Thapar, in the Vedic period, when &quot;mores of the clan gave way to the norms of caste&quot;, wives were obliged to join in quite a few rituals but without much authority. A ritual with support in a Vedic text was a &quot;symbolic self-immolation&quot; which it is believed a widow of status needed to perform at the death of her husband, the widow subsequently marrying her husband&#x27;s brother. In later centuries, the text was cited as the origin of Sati, with a variant reading allowing the authorities to insist that the widow sacrifice herself in reality by joining her deceased husband on the funeral pyre.

Anand A. Yang notes that the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; refers to a &quot;mimetic ceremony&quot; where a &quot;widow lay on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre before it was lit but was raised from it by a male relative of her dead husband.&quot; According to Yang, the word &quot;agre&quot;, &quot;to go forth&quot;, was (probably in the 16th century) mistranslated into &quot;agneh&quot;, &quot;into the fire&quot;, to give Vedic sanction for sati.

===Early medieval origins===
Sati as the burning of a widow with her deceased husband seems to have been introduced in the pre-Gupta era, since 500 CE. Vidya Dehejia states that sati was forced into Indian society through Hindu culturural practice, and became active practice after 500 CE. According to Ashis Nandy, the practice became prevalent from vedas and declined to its elimination in the 17th century to gain resurgence in Bengal in the 18th century from British ethical involvement. Historian Roshen Dalal postulates that its mention in some of the Puranas indicates that it slowly grew in prevalence from 5th–7th century and later became an accepted custom around 1000 CE among those of higher classes, especially the Rajputs. One of the stanzas in the Mahabharata describes Madri&#x27;s suicide by sati, but is likely an interpolation given that it has contradictions with the succeeding verses.

According to Dehejia, sati originated within the Kshatriya (warrior) aristocracy and remained mostly limited to the warrior class among and Hindus. According to Thapar, the introduction and growth of the practice of sati as a forced fire sacrifice is related to new Kshatriyas, who forged their own culture and took some rules &quot;rather literally&quot;, with a variant reading of the Veda turning the symbolic practice into the practice of pushing a widow and burning her with her husband. Thapar further points to the &quot;subordination of women in patriarchal society&quot;, &quot;changing &#x27;systems of kinship, and &quot;control over female sexuality&quot; as factors in the rise of sati.

===Medieval spread===
The practice of sati was emulated by those seeking to achieve high status of the royalty and the warriors as part of the process of Sanskritisation, but its spread was also related to the centuries of Islamic invasion and its expansion in South Asia, and to the hardship and marginalisation that widows endured.

Sati acquired an additional meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain, akin to the practice of &quot;jauhar&quot;, with the ideologies of &quot;jauhar&quot; and sati reinforcing each other. &quot;Jauhar&quot; was originally a self-chosen death for queens and noblewomen facing defeat in war, and practised especially among the warrior Rajputs. Oldenburg posits that the enslavement of women by Greek conquerors may have started this practice, On attested Rajput practice of jauhar during wars, and notes that the &quot;kshatriyas&quot; or Rajput castes, not the Brahmins, were the most respected community in Rajasthan in north-west India, as they defended the land against invaders centuries before the coming of the Muslims. She proposes that Brahmins of the north-west copied Rajput practices, and transformed sati ideologically from the &#x27;brave woman&#x27; into the &#x27;good woman&#x27;. From those Brahmins, the practice spread to other non-warrior castes.

According to David Brick of Yale University, sati, which was initially rejected by the Brahmins of Kashmir, spread among them in the later half of the first millennium. Brick&#x27;s evidence for claiming this spread is the mention of sati-like practices in the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot; (700–1000 CE), which is believed to have been written in Kashmir. Brick argues that the author of the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot; may have been mentioning practices existing in his own community. Brick notes that the dates of other Dharmasastra texts mentioning &quot;sahagamana&quot; are not known with certainty, but posits that the priestly class throughout India was aware of the texts and the practice itself by the 12th century. According to Anand Yang, it was practised in Bengal as early as the 12th century, where it was originally practised by the Kshatriya caste and later spread to other upper and lower castes including Brahmins. Julia Leslie writes that the practice increased among Bengali Brahmins between 1680 and 1830, after widows gained inheritance rights.

===Colonial era revival===
Sati practice resumed during the colonial era, particularly in significant numbers in colonial Bengal. Three factors may have contributed this revival: sati was believed to be supported by Hindu scriptures by the 19th century; sati was encouraged by unscrupulous neighbours as it was a means of property annexation from a widow who had the right to inherit her dead husband&#x27;s property under Hindu law, and sati helped eliminate the inheritor; poverty was so extreme during the 19th century that sati was a means of escape for a woman with no means or hope of survival.

Daniel Grey states that the understanding of origins and spread of sati were distorted in the colonial era because of a concerted effort to push &quot;problem Hindu&quot; theories in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Lata Mani wrote that all of the parties during the British colonial era that debated the issue subscribed to the belief in a &quot;golden age&quot; of Indian women followed by a decline in concurrence to the Muslim conquests. This discourse also resulted in promotion of a view of British missionaries rescuing &quot;Hindu India from Islamic tyranny&quot;. Several British missionaries who had studied classical Indian literature attempted to employ Hindu scriptural interpretations in their missionary work to convince their followers that Sati was not mandated by Hinduism.

==History==

===Earliest records===

====Early Greek sources====
Among those that do reference the practice, the lost works of the Greek historian Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who travelled to India with the expedition of Alexander the Great in , are preserved in the fragments of Strabo. There are different views by authors on what Aristobulus hears as widows of one or more tribes in India performing self-sacrifice on the husband&#x27;s pyre, one author also mentions that widows who declined to die were held in disgrace. In contrast, Megasthenes who visited India during 300 BCE does not mention any specific reference to the practice, which Dehejia takes as an indication that the practice was non-existent then.

Diodorus writes about the wives of Ceteus, the Indian captain of Eumenes, competing for burning themselves after his death in the Battle of Paraitakene (317 BCE). The younger one is permitted to mount the pyre. Modern historians believe Diodorus&#x27;s source for this episode was the eyewitness account of the now lost historian Hieronymus of Cardia. Hieronymus&#x27; explanation of the origin of sati appears to be his own composite, created from a variety of Indian traditions and practices to form a moral lesson upholding traditional Greek values. Modern scholarship has generally treated this instance as an isolated incident, not representative of general culture.

Two other independent sources that mention widows who voluntarily joined their husbands&#x27; pyres as a mark of their love are Cicero and Nicolaus of Damascus.

====Early Sanskrit sources====
Some of the early Sanskrit authors like Daṇḍin in &quot;Daśakumāracarita&quot; and Banabhatta in &quot;Harshacharita&quot; mention that women who burnt themselves wore extravagant dresses. Bana tells about Yasomati who, after choosing to mount the pyre, bids farewell to her relatives and servants. She then decks herself in jewelry which she later distributes to others. Although Prabhakaravardhana&#x27;s death is expected, Arvind Sharma suggests it is another form of sati. The same work mentions Harsha&#x27;s sister Rajyasri trying to commit sati after her husband died. In &quot;Kadambari&quot;, Bana greatly opposes sati and gives examples of women who did not choose &quot;sahgamana&quot;.

====Sangam literature====
Padma Sree asserts that other evidence for some form of sati comes from Sangam literature in Tamilakam: for instance the written in the 2nd century CE. In this tale, Kannagi, the chaste wife of her wayward husband Kovalan, burns Madurai to the ground when her husband is executed unjustly, then climbs a cliff to join Kovalan in heaven. She became an object of worship as a chaste wife, called &quot;Pattini&quot; in Sinhala and in Tamil, and is still worshipped today. An inscription in an urn burial from the 1st century CE tells of a widow who told the potter to make the urn big enough for both her and her husband. The similarly provides evidence that such practices existed in Tamil lands, and the claims widows prefer to die with their husband due to the dangerous negative power associated with them. However she notes that this glorification of sacrifice was not unique to women: just as the texts glorified &quot;good&quot; wives who sacrificed themselves for their husbands and families, &quot;good&quot; warriors similarly sacrificed themselves for their kings and lands. It is even possible that the sacrifice of the &quot;good&quot; wives originated from the warrior sacrifice tradition. Today, such women are still worshipped as &quot;Gramadevis&quot; throughout South India.

====Inscriptional evidence====
According to Axel Michaels, the first inscriptional evidence of the practice is from Nepal in 464 CE, and in India from 510 CE. The early evidence suggests that widow-burning practice was seldom carried out in the general population. Centuries later, instances of sati began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones called Sati stones. According to J.C. Harle, the medieval memorial stones appear in two forms – &quot;viragal&quot; (hero stone) and &quot;satigal&quot; (sati stone), each to memorialise something different. Both of these are found in many regions of India, but &quot;rarely if ever earlier in date than the 8th or 9th century&quot;. Numerous memorial sati stones appear 11th-century onwards, states Michaels, and the largest collections are found in Rajasthan. There have been few instances of sati in the Chola Empire of South India. Vanavan Mahadevi, the mother of Rajaraja Chola I (10th century) and Viramahadevi the queen of Rajendra Chola I (11th century) both committed Sati upon their husband&#x27;s death by ascending the pyre. The 510 CE inscription at Eran mentioning the wife of Goparaja, a vassal of Bhanugupta, burning herself on her husband&#x27;s pyre is considered to be a Sati stone.

===Practice in Hindu-influenced cultures outside India===
The early 14th-century CE traveler of Pordenone mentions wife burning in Zampa (Champa), in nowadays south/central Vietnam. Anant Altekar states that sati spread with Hindu migrants to Southeast Asian islands, such as to Java, Sumatra and Bali. According to Dutch colonial records, this was however a rare practice in Indonesia, one found in royal households.
In Cambodia, both the lords and the wives of a dead king voluntarily burnt themselves in the 15th and 16th centuries. According to European traveller accounts, in 15th century Mergui, in present-day extreme south Myanmar, widow burning was practised. A Chinese pilgrim from the 15th century seems to attest the practice on islands called Ma-i-tung and Ma-i (possibly Belitung (outside Sumatra) and Northern Philippines, respectively).

According to the historian K.M. de Silva, Christian missionaries in Sri Lanka with a substantial Hindu minority population, reported &quot;there were no glaring social evils associated with the indigenous religions-no &quot;sati&quot;, (...). There was thus less scope for the social reformer.&quot; However, although sati was non-existent in the colonial era, earlier Muslim travelers such as Sulaiman al-Tajir reported that sati was optionally practised, which a widow could choose to undertake.

===Mughal Empire (1526–1857)===
Ambivalence of Mughal rulers

According to Annemarie Schimmel, the Mughal Emperor Akbar I () was averse to the practice of Sati; however, he expressed his admiration for &quot;widows who wished to be cremated with their deceased husbands&quot;. He was averse to abuse, and in 1582, Akbar issued a decree to prevent any use of compulsion in sati. According to M. Reza Pirbhai, a professor of South Asian and World history, it is unclear if a prohibition on sati was issued by Akbar, and other than a claim of ban by Monserrate upon his insistence, no other primary sources mention an actual ban. Instances of sati continued during and after the era of Akbar.

Jahangir (), who succeeded Akbar in the early 17th century, found sati prevalent among the Hindus of Rajaur, Kashmir. The reaction to sati was not uniform across different cultural groups. While Hindus were generally more accepting of it, some Muslims also expressed occasional admiration, though the dominant attitude was disapproval. Sushil Chaudhury highlights that Muslim sources often avoided detailed discussions about it, apart from occasional references. Overall, both admiration and criticism of sati cut across cultural lines, with examples of support from Greeks, Muslims, and British individuals, and opposition from Hindus, dating back as far as the seventh century. According to Chaudhury, the evidence suggests that sati was admired by Hindus, but both &quot;Hindus and Muslims went in large numbers to witness a sati and sati was almost universally admired by people in mediaeval India.&quot; According to Reza Pirbhai, the memoirs of Jahangir suggest sati continued in his regime, was practised by Hindus and Muslims, he was fascinated by the custom, and that those Kashmiri Muslim widows who practised sati either immolated themselves or buried themselves alive with their dead husbands. Jahangir prohibited such sati and other customary practices in Kashmir.

Aurangzeb () issued another order in 1663, states Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, after returning from Kashmir, &quot;in all lands under Mughal control, never again should the officials allow a woman to be burnt&quot;. The Aurangzeb order, states Ikram, though mentioned in the formal histories, is recorded in the official records of Aurangzeb&#x27;s time. Although Aurangzeb&#x27;s orders could be evaded with payment of bribes to officials, adds Ikram, later European travelers record that sati was not much practised in the Mughal Empire, and that Sati was &quot;very rare, except it be some Rajah&#x27;s wives, that the Indian women burn at all&quot; by the end of Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign.

Descriptions by Westerners

The memoirs of European merchants and travelers, as well the colonial era Christian missionaries of British India described Sati practices under Mughal rulers. Ralph Fitch noted in 1591:
François Bernier (1620–1688) gave the following description:

The Spanish missionary Domingo Navarrete wrote in 1670 of different styles of Sati during Aurangzeb&#x27;s time.

===British and other European colonial powers===
====Non-British colonial powers in India====
Afonso de Albuquerque banned sati immediately after the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510. Local Brahmins convinced the newly arrived Francisco Barreto to rescind the ban in 1555 in spite of protests from the local Christians and the Church authorities, but the ban was reinstated in 1560 by Constantino de Bragança with additional serious criminal penalties (including loss of property and liberty) against those encouraging the practice.

The Dutch and the French banned it in Chinsurah and Pondichéry, their respective colonies. The Danes, who held the small territories of Tranquebar and Serampore, permitted it until the 19th century. The Danish strictly forbade, apparently early the custom of sati at &quot;Tranquebar&quot;, a colony they held from 1620 to 1845 (whereas Serampore (Frederiksnagore) was a Danish colony merely from 1755 to 1845).

====Early British policy====
The first official British response to sati was in 1680 when the Agent of Madras Streynsham Master intervened and prohibited the burning of a Hindu widow in Madras Presidency. Attempts to limit or ban the practice had been made by individual British officers, but without the backing of the East India Company. This is because it followed a policy of non-interference in Hindu religious affairs and there was no legislation or ban against Sati. The first formal British ban was imposed in 1798, in the city of Calcutta only. The practice continued in surrounding regions. In the beginning of the 19th century, the evangelical church in Britain, and its members in India, started campaigns against sati. This activism came about during a period when British missionaries in India began focusing on promoting and establishing Christian educational systems as a distinctive contribution of theirs to the missionary enterprise as a whole. Leaders of these campaigns included William Carey and William Wilberforce. These movements put pressure on the company to ban the act. William Carey, and the other missionaries at Serampore conducted in 1803–04 a census on cases of sati for a region within a 30-mile radius of Calcutta, finding more than 300 such cases there. The missionaries also approached Hindu theologians, who opined that the practice was encouraged, rather than enjoined by the Hindu scriptures.

Serampore was a Danish colony, rather than British, and the reason why Carey started his mission in Danish India, rather than in British territories, was because the East India Company did not accept Christian missionary activity within their domains. In 1813, when the Company&#x27;s Charter came up for renewal William Wilberforce, drawing on the statistics on sati collected by Carey and the other Serampore missionaries and mobilising public opinion against suttee, successfully ensured the passage of a Bill in Parliament legalising missionary activities in India, with a view to ending the practice through the religious transformation of Indian society. He stated in his address to the House of Commons: Let us endeavour to strike our roots into the soil by the gradual introduction and establishment of our own principles and opinions; of our laws, institutions and manners; above all, as the source of every other improvement, of our religion and consequently of our moralsElijah Hoole in his book &quot;Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India, from 1820 to 1828&quot; reports an instance of Sati at Bangalore, which he did not personally witness. Another missionary, Mr. England, reports witnessing Sati in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station on 9 June 1826. However, these practices were very rare after the Government of Madras cracked down on the practice from the early 1800s (p. 82).

The British authorities within the Bengal Presidency started systematically to collect data on the practice in 1815.

====Principal reformers and 1829 ban====

The principal campaigners against Sati were Christian and Hindu reformers such as William Carey and Ram Mohan Roy. In 1799 Carey, a Baptist missionary from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. Horrified by the practice, Carey and his coworkers Joshua Marshman and William Ward opposed sati from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the Serampore Trio, they published essays forcefully condemning the practice and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley.

In 1812, Ram Mohan Roy began to champion the cause of banning sati practice. He was motivated by the experience of seeing his own sister-in-law being forced to die by sati. He visited Kolkata&#x27;s cremation grounds to persuade widows against immolation, formed watch groups to do the same, sought the support of other elite Bengali classes, and wrote and disseminated articles to show that it was not required by Hindu scripture. He was at loggerheads with Hindu groups which did not want the Government to interfere in religious practices.

From 1815 to 1818 sati deaths doubled. Ram Mohan Roy launched an attack on sati that &quot;aroused such anger that for awhile his life was in danger&quot;. In 1821 he published a tract opposing Sati, and in 1823 the Serampore missionaries led by Carey published a book containing their earlier essays, of which the first three chapters opposed Sati. Another Christian missionary published a tract against Sati in 1927.

Sahajanand Swami, the founder of the Swaminarayan sect, preached against the practice of sati in his area of influence, that is Gujarat. He argued that the practice had no Vedic standing and only God could take a life he had given. He also opined that widows could lead lives that would eventually lead to salvation. Sir John Malcolm, the Governor of Bombay supported Sahajanand Swami in this endeavour.

In 1828 Lord William Bentinck came to power as Governor-General of India. When he landed in Calcutta, he said that he felt &quot;the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if... he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.&quot; Bentinck decided to put an immediate end to sati. Ram Mohan Roy warned Bentinck against abruptly ending sati. However, after observing that the judges in the courts were unanimously in favour of reform, Bentinck proceeded to lay the draft before his council. Charles Metcalfe, the Governor&#x27;s most prominent counselor expressed apprehension that the banning of sati might be &quot;used by the disaffected and designing&quot; as &quot;an engine to produce insurrection&quot;. However these concerns did not deter him from upholding the Governor&#x27;s decision &quot;in the suppression of the horrible custom by which so many lives are cruelly sacrificed.&quot; Thus on Sunday morning of 4 December 1829 Lord Bentinck issued Regulation XVII declaring sati to be illegal and punishable in criminal courts. It was presented to William Carey for translation. His response is recorded as follows: &quot;Springing to his feet and throwing off his black coat he cried, &#x27;No church for me to-day... If I delay an hour to translate and publish this, many a widow&#x27;s life may be sacrificed,&#x27; he said. By evening the task was finished.&quot;

On 2 February 1830 this law was extended to Madras and Bombay. The ban was challenged by a petition signed by &quot;several thousand... Hindoo inhabitants of Bihar, Bengal, Orissa etc&quot; and the matter went to the Privy Council in London. Along with British supporters, Ram Mohan Roy presented counter-petitions to Parliament in support of ending sati. The Privy Council rejected the petition in 1832, and the ban on sati was upheld.

After the ban, Balochi priests in the Sindh region complained to the British Governor, Charles Napier about what they claimed was a meddlement in a sacred custom of their nation. Napier replied:Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs!Thereafter, the account goes, no suttee took place.

====Princely states/Independent kingdoms====

Sati remained legal in some princely states for a time after it had been banned in lands under British control. Baroda and other princely states of Kathiawar Agency banned the practice in 1840, whereas Kolhapur followed them in 1841, the princely state of Indore some time before 1843. According to a speaker at the East India House in 1842, the princely states of Satara, Nagpur and Mysore had by then banned sati. Jaipur banned the practice in 1846, while Hyderabad, Gwalior and Jammu and Kashmir did the same in 1847. Awadh and Bhopal (both Muslim-ruled states) were actively suppressing sati by 1849. Cutch outlawed it in 1852 with Jodhpur having banned sati about the same time.

The 1846 abolition in Jaipur was regarded by many British as a catalyst for the abolition cause within Rajputana Agency; within 4 months after Jaipur&#x27;s 1846 ban, 11 of the 18 independently governed states in Rajputana had followed Jaipur&#x27;s example. One paper says that in the year 1846–1847 alone, 23 states in the whole of India (not just within Rajputana) had banned sati. It was not until 1861 that sati was legally banned in all the princely states of India, Mewar resisting for a long time before that time. The last legal case of sati within a princely state dates from 1861 in Udaipur the capital of Mewar, but as Anant S. Altekar shows, local opinion had then shifted strongly against the practice. The widows of Maharanna Sarup Singh declined to become sati upon his death, and the only one to follow him in death was a concubine. Later the same year, the general ban on sati was issued by a proclamation from Empress Victoria.

In some princely states such as Travancore, the custom of sati never prevailed, although it was held in reverence by the common people. For example, the regent Gowri Parvati Bayi was asked by the British Resident if he should permit a sati to take place in 1818, but the regent urged him not to do so, since the custom of sati had never been acceptable in her domains. In another state, Sawantwadi, the King Khem Sawant III (r. 1755–1803) is credited for having issued a positive &quot;prohibition&quot; of sati over a period of ten or twelve years. That prohibition from the 18th century may never have been actively enforced, or may have been ignored, since in 1843, the government in Sawantwadi issued a new prohibition of sati.

===Post independence times===

====Legislative status of sati in present-day India====
Following the outcry after the sati of Roop Kanwar, the Government of India enacted the Rajasthan Sati Prevention Ordinance, 1987 on 1 October 1987. and later passed the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987.

The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) defines sati as:

The burning or burying alive of –
:(i) any widow along with the body of her deceased husband or any other relative or with any article, object or thing associated with the husband or such relative; or
:(ii) any woman along with the body of any of her relatives, irrespective of whether such burning or burying is claimed to be voluntary on the part of the widow or the women or otherwise

The &quot;Prevention of Sati Act&quot; makes it illegal to support, glorify or attempt to die by sati. Support of sati, including coercing or forcing someone to die by sati, can be punished by death penalty or life imprisonment, while glorifying sati is punishable with one to seven years in prison.

Enforcement of these measures is not always consistent. The National Council of Women in India (NCWI) has suggested amendments to the law to remove some of these flaws. Prohibitions of certain practices, such as worship at ancient shrines, is a matter of controversy.

====Current situation====
There were 30 reported cases of sati or attempted sati over a 44-year period (1943–1987) in India, the official number being 28. A well-documented case from 1987 was that of 18-year-old Roop Kanwar. In response to this incident, additional legislation against sati practice was passed, first within the state of Rajasthan, then federally by the Central Government of India.

In 2002, a 65-year-old woman by the name of Kuttu died after sitting on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre in Panna district of Madhya Pradesh. On 18 May 2006, Vidyawati, a 35-year-old woman allegedly committed sati by jumping into the blazing funeral pyre of her husband in Rari-Bujurg Village, Fatehpur district, Uttar Pradesh.

On 21 August 2006, Janakrani, a 40-year-old woman, burned to death on the funeral pyre of her husband Prem Narayan in Sagar district; Janakrani had not been forced or prompted by anybody to commit the act.

On 11 October 2008 a 75-year-old woman, Lalmati Verma, committed sati by jumping into her 80-year-old husband&#x27;s funeral pyre at Checher in the Kasdol block of Chhattisgarh&#x27;s Raipur district; Verma killed herself after mourners had left the cremation site.

Scholars debate whether these rare reports of sati by widows are related to culture or are examples of mental illness and suicide. In the case of Roop Kanwar, Dinesh Bhugra states that there is a possibility that the suicides could be triggered by &quot;a state of depersonalization as a result of severe bereavement&quot;, then adds that it is unlikely that Kanwar had mental illness and culture likely played a role. However, Colucci and Lester state that none of the women reported by media to have committed sati had been given a psychiatric evaluation before their sati suicide and thus there is no objective data to ascertain if culture or mental illness was the primary driver behind their suicide. Inamdar, Oberfield and Darrell state that the women who commit sati are often &quot;childless or old and face miserable impoverished lives&quot; which combined with great stress from the loss of the only personal support may be the cause of a widow&#x27;s suicide.

The Enforcement of India&#x27;s 1987 Sati Law

The passing of The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 was seen as an unprecedented move to many in India, and was hailed as a new era in the women&#x27;s rights movement.

The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 appears to be facing its greatest challenge on the aspect of the law which penalises the glorification of Sati in Section 2 of this Act:

&quot;(i) The observance of any ceremony or the taking out of a procession in connection with the commission of Sati; or

(ii) The supporting, justifying or propagating of the practice of Sati in any manner; or

(iii) The arranging of any function to eulogise the person who has committed Sati; or

(iv) The creation of a trust, or the collection of funds, or the construction of a temple or other structure or the carrying on of any form of worship or the performance of any ceremony thereat, with a view to perpetuate the honour of, or to preserve the memory of, a person who has committed Sati.&quot;

The punishment for glorifying sati is a minimum one-year sentence that can be increased to seven years in prison and a minimum fine of 5,000 rupees that can be increased to 30,000 rupees. This Section of the Act has become heavily criticised by both sides of the Sati debate. Proponents of Sati argue against it, claiming the practice to be a part of Indian culture. Simultaneously, those against the practice of Sati also question the practicality of such a law, since it may be interpreted in a manner so as to punish the victim.

India continues to witness a cultural divide in regards to their opinions of Sati, with a great deal of the glorification of this practice occurring within it. The Calcutta Marwari have been noted to follow the practice of Sati worship, yet the community alleges it to be a part of their culture and insist they be permitted to follow their practices. Additionally, the practice is still fervently revered in parts of rural India, with entire temples still dedicated to previous victims of Sati.

India is steeped in a heavily patriarchal system and their norms, making it difficult for even the most vigilant of authorities to enforce the 1987 Act. An instance of this can be seen in 2002 where two police officers were attacked by a mob of approximately 1000 people when attempting to stop an instance of Sati. In India, the powers of the police remain structurally limited by the political elite. Their limited powers are compounded by &quot;patriarchal values, religious freedoms, and ideologies&quot; within India.

Furthermore, enforcement of this law is easily circumnavigated by authorities by writing off cases of Sati as acts of suicide.

==Practice==
Accounts describe numerous variants in the sati ritual. The majority of accounts describe the woman seated or lying down on the funeral pyre beside her dead husband. Many other accounts describe women walking or jumping into the flames after the fire had been lit, and some describe women seating themselves on the funeral pyre and then lighting it themselves.

===Variations in procedure===
Although sati is typically thought of as consisting of the procedure in which the widow is placed, or enters, or jumps, upon the funeral pyre of her husband, slight variations in funeral practice have been reported here as well, by region. For example, the mid-17th-century traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier claims that in some regions, the sati occurred by construction of a small hut, within which the widow and her husband were burnt, while in other regions, a pit was dug, in which the husband&#x27;s corpse was placed along with flammable materials, into which the widow jumped after the fire had started. In mid-nineteenth-century Lombok, an island in today&#x27;s Indonesia, the local Balinese aristocracy practised widow suicide on occasion; but only widows of royal descent could burn themselves alive (others were stabbed to death with a kris dagger first). At Lombok, a high bamboo platform was erected in front of the fire and, when the flames were at their strongest, the widow climbed up the platform and dived into the fire.

===Live burials===
Most Hindu communities, especially in North India, only bury the bodies of those under the age of two, such as baby girls. Those older than two are customarily cremated. A few European accounts provide rare descriptions of Indian sati that included the burial of the widow with her dead husband. One of the drawings in the Portuguese Códice Casanatense shows the live burial of a Hindu widow in the 16th century. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a 17th-century world traveller and trader of gems, wrote that women were buried with their dead husbands along the Coast of Coromandel while people danced during the cremation rites.
The 18th-century Flemish painter Frans Balthazar Solvyns provided the only known eyewitness account of an Indian sati involving a burial. Solvyns states that the custom included the woman shaving her head, music and the event was guarded by East India Company soldiers. He expressed admiration for the Hindu woman, but also calls the custom barbaric.

The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) includes within its definition of sati not just the act of burning a widow alive, but also that of burying her alive.

===Compulsion===
Sati is often described as voluntary, although in some cases it may have been forced. In one narrative account in 1785, the widow appears to have been drugged either with bhang or opium and was tied to the pyre which would have prevented her from escaping the fire, if she changed her mind.

The Anglo-Indian press of the period proffered several accounts of alleged forcing of the woman. As an example, &quot;The Calcutta Review&quot; published accounts as the following one:
Apart from accounts of direct compulsion, some evidence exists that precautions, at times, were taken so that the widow could not escape the flames once they were lit. Anant S. Altekar, for example, points out that it is much more difficult to escape a fiery pit that one has jumped in, than descending from a pyre one has entered on. He mentions the custom of the fiery pit as particularly prevalent in the Deccan and western India. From Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, where the widow typically was placed in a hut along with her husband, her leg was tied to one of the hut&#x27;s pillars. Finally, from Bengal, where the tradition of the pyre held sway, the widow&#x27;s feet could be tied to posts fixed to the ground, she was asked three times if she wished to ascend to heaven, before the flames were lit.

Ram Mohan Roy observed that when women allow themselves to be consigned to the funeral pyre of a deceased husband it results not just &quot;from religious prejudices only&quot;, but, &quot;also from witnessing the distress in which widows of the same rank in life are involved, and the insults and slights to which they are daily subject.&quot;

The historian Anant Sadashiv Altekar states that some historical records suggest without doubt that instances of sati were forced, but overall the evidence suggests most instances were a voluntary act on the woman&#x27;s part.

===Symbolic sati===

There have been accounts of symbolic sati in some Hindu communities. A widow lies down next to her dead husband, and certain parts of both the marriage ceremony and the funeral ceremonies are enacted, but without her death. An example in Sri Lanka is attested from modern times. Although this form of symbolic sati has contemporary evidence, it should by no means be regarded as a modern invention. For example, the ancient and sacred Atharvaveda, one of the four Vedas, believed to have been composed around 1000 BCE, describes a funerary ritual where the widow lies down by her deceased husband, but is then asked to ascend, to enjoy the blessings from the children and wealth left to her. Dehejia states that Vedic literature has no mention of any practice resembling sati. There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying down beside her dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving and return to the living, then prayer is offered for a happy life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse; its solitary mention may also be explained as an insertion into the text at a latter date. Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati (since killing/self killing) would have been condemned by them.

In 20th-century India, a tradition developed of venerating &quot;jivit&quot; (living satis). A &quot;jivit&quot; is a woman who once desired to commit sati, but lives after having sacrificed her desire to die. Two famous &quot;jivit&quot; were Bala Satimata, and Umca Satimata, both lived until the early 1990s.

==Prevalence==
===Numbers===
====Pre-colonial period====
Records of sati exist throughout many times periods and regions of the subcontinent. However, there seems to have been major differences in different regions, and among communities. No reliable figures exist for the numbers who have died by sati in general. According to Yang, the &quot;pre-1815&quot; data is &quot;scanty&quot; and &quot;fraught with problems&quot;. However, several notable instances of sati have been recorded. The most famous perhaps is the case of the Rajput queen, Rani Padmini of Mewar, whose story, though somewhat legendary, exemplifies the valorization of the practice.

====Colonial period====
An 1829 report by a Christian missionary organisation includes among other things, statistics on sati. It begins with a declaration that &quot;the object of all missions to the heathen is to substitute for these systems the Gospel of Christ&quot;, thereafter lists sati for each year over the period 1815–1824, which totals 5,369, followed by a statement that a total of 5,997 instances of women were burned or buried alive in the Bengal Presidency over a 10-year period, i.e., average 600 per year. In the same report, it states that the Madras and Bombay presidencies totaled 635 instances of sati over the same ten-year period. The 1829 missionary report does not provide its sources and acknowledges that &quot;no correct idea can be formed of the number of murders occasioned by suttees&quot;, then states that some of the statistics are based on &quot;conjectures&quot;. According to Yang, these &quot;numbers are fraught with problems&quot;.

William Bentinck, in an 1829 report, without specifying the year or period, stated that &quot;of the 463 satis occurring in the whole of the Presidency of Fort William, 420 took place in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, or what is termed the Lower Provinces, and of these latter 287 in the Calcutta Division alone&quot;. For the Upper Provinces, Bentinck added, &quot;in these Provinces the satis amount to forty three only upon a population of nearly twenty millions&quot;, i.e., average one sati per 465,000.

===Social composition and age distribution===
Anand Yang, speaking of the early nineteenth century, says that contrary to conventional wisdom, sati was not, in general, an upper class phenomenon, but spread through the classes/castes. In the 575 reported cases from 1823, for example, 41 percent were Brahmins, 6 percent were Kshatriyas, 2 percent were Vaishiyas, and 51 percent were Shudras. In Banaras, in the 1815–1828 British records, the upper castes were only represented for 2 years - less than 70% of the total; whereas in 1821, all sati were from the upper castes there.

Yang notes that many studies seem to emphasise the young age of the widows who committed sati. By studying the British figures from 1815 to 1828, Yang states that the overwhelming majority were ageing women; statistics from 1825 to 1826 show that about two thirds were above the age of 40 when committing sati.

===Regional variations of incidence===
Anand Yang summarizes the regional variation in incidence of sati as follows:

====Konkan/Maharashtra====
Narayan H. Kulkarnee believes that sati came to be practised in 17th Century Maharashtra, initially by the Maratha nobility claiming Rajput descent. According to Kulkarnee, the practice may have increased across caste distinctions as an honour-saving custom in the face of Muslim advances into the territory. But the practice never gained the prevalence seen in Rajasthan or Bengal, and social customs of actively dissuading a widow from committing sati are well established. Apparently not a single instance of forced sati is attested for the 17th and 18th centuries CE. Forced or not forced, there were several instances of women from the Bhonsle dynasty committing sati. One was Shivaji&#x27;s eldest childless widow, Putalabai, who committed sati after her husband&#x27;s death. One controversial case was that of Chhatrapati Shahu I&#x27;s widow who was forced to commit sati due to political intrigues regarding succession at the Satara court following Shahu&#x27;s death in 1749. The most &quot;celebrated&quot; case of sati was that of Ramabai, the widow of Brahmin Peshwa Madhavrao I, who committed sati in 1772 on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. This was considered unusual because unlike &quot;kshatriya&quot; widows, Brahmin widows very rarely followed the practice.

====South India====
Several sati stones have been found in the Vijayanagara Empire. These stones were erected as a mark of a heroic deed of sacrifice of the wife for her husband and towards the land. The sati stone evidence from the time of the empire is regarded as relatively rare; only about 50 are clearly identified as such. Thus, Carla M. Sinopoli, citing Verghese, says that despite the attention European travellers paid the phenomenon, it should be regarded as having been fairly uncommon during the time of the Vijayanagara Empire.

The Madurai Nayak dynasty (1529–1736 CE) seems to have adopted the custom in larger measure, one Jesuit priest in 1609 in Madurai observed the burning of 400 women at the death of Nayak Muttu Krishnappa.

The Kongu Nadu region of Tamil Nadu has the highest number of Veera Maha Sati (வீரமாசதி) or Veeramathy temples (வீரமாத்தி) from all the native Kongu castes.

A few records exist from the Princely State of Mysore, established in 1799, that say permission to commit sati could be granted. Dewan (prime minister) Purnaiah is said to have allowed it for a Brahmin widow in 1805, whereas an 1827 eye witness to the burning of a widow in Bangalore in 1827 says it was rather uncommon there.

====Gangetic plain====
In the Upper Gangetic plain, while sati occurred, there is no indication that it was especially widespread. The earliest known attempt by a government - the Muslim Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq - to stop this Hindu practice took place in the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century.

In the Lower Gangetic plain, sati practice may have reached a high level fairly late in history. According to available evidence and existing reports of occurrences, the greatest incidence of sati in any region and period occurred in Bengal and Bihar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

====Nepal and Bali====
The earliest stone inscription in the Indian subcontinent relating to sati has been found in Nepal, dating from the 5th century, where the king successfully persuades his mother not to commit sati after his father dies, suggesting that it was practised but was not compulsory. The Kingdom of Nepal formally banned sati in 1920.

On the Indonesian island of Bali, sati (known as &quot;masatya&quot;) was practised by the aristocracy as late as 1903, until the Dutch colonial authorities pushed for its termination, forcing the local Balinese princes to sign treaties containing the prohibition of sati as one of the clauses. Early Dutch observers of the Balinese custom in the 17th century said that only widows of royal blood were allowed to be burned alive. Concubines or others of inferior blood lines who consented or wanted to die with their princely husband had to be stabbed to death before being burned.

==Terminology==

Lindsey Harlan, having conducted extensive field work among Rajput women, has constructed a model of how and why women who committed sati are still venerated today, and how the worshippers think about the process involved. Essentially, a woman becomes a sati in three stages:
# having been a &quot;pativrata&quot;, or dutiful wife, during her husband&#x27;s life,
# making, at her husband&#x27;s death, a solemn vow to burn by his side, thus gaining status as a &quot;sativrata&quot;, and
# having endured being burnt alive, achieving the status of &quot;satimata&quot;.

===Pativrata===
The &quot;pativrata&quot; is devoted and subservient to her husband, and also protective of him. If he dies before her, some culpability is attached to her for his death, as not having been sufficiently protective of him. Making the vow to burn alive beside him removes her culpability, as well as enabling her to protect him from new dangers in the afterlife.

===Sativrata===
In Harlan&#x27;s model, having made the holy vow to burn herself, the woman becomes a &quot;sativrata&quot;, existing in a transitional stage between the living and the dead called the &quot;Antarabhava&quot; before ascending the funeral pyre. Once a woman had committed herself to becoming a sati, popular belief thought her to be endowed with many supernatural powers. Lourens P. Van Den Bosch enumerates some of them: prophecy and clairvoyance, and the ability to bless with sons women who had not borne sons before. Gifts from a sati were venerated as valuable relics, and in her journey to the pyre, people would seek to touch her garments to benefit from her powers.

Lindsey Harlan probes deeper into the &quot;sativrata&quot; state. As a transitional figure on her path to becoming a powerful family protector as &quot;satimata&quot;, the &quot;sativrata&quot; dictates the terms and obligations that the family, in showing reverence to her, must observe in order for her to be able to protect them once she has become satimata. These conditions are generally called &quot;ok&quot;. A typical example of an &quot;ok&quot; is a restriction on the colours or types of clothing the family members may wear.

&quot;Shrap&quot;, or curses, are also within the &quot;sativrata&quot;&#x27;s power, associated with remonstrations on members of the family for how they have failed. One woman cursed her in-laws when they brought neither a horse nor a drummer to her pyre, saying that whenever they might need either in the future, (many religious rituals require the presence of such things), it would not be available to them. 

===Satimata===
After her death on the pyre, the woman is finally transformed into the shape of the &quot;satimata&quot;, a spiritual embodiment of goodness, her principal concern being a family protector. Typically, the &quot;satimata&quot; manifests in the dreams of family members, for example, to teach the women how to be good &quot;pativratas&quot;, having proved herself through her sacrifice that she was the perfect &quot;pativrata&quot;. However, although the &quot;satimata&quot;&#x27;s intentions are always for the good of the family, she is not averse to letting children become sick, or the cows&#x27; udders to wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who has neglected her duties as &quot;pativrata&quot;.

==In scriptures==
Although it is debated whether it received scriptural mention in early Hinduism, it has been linked to related Hindu practices in regions of India. In the Hindu scriptures, states David Brick, Sati is a wholly voluntary endeavor; it is not portrayed as an obligatory practice, nor does the application of physical coercion serve as a motivating factor in its lawful execution.

In the following, a historical chronology is given of the debate within Hinduism on the topic of sati.

===The oldest Vedic texts===

The Vedic Verse 7 itself, unlike verse 8, does not mention widowhood, but the meaning of the syllables &quot;yoni&quot; (literally &quot;seat, abode&quot;) have been rendered as &quot;go up into the &quot;dwelling&quot;&quot; (by Wilson), as &quot;step into the &quot;pyre&quot;&quot; (by Kane), as &quot;mount the &quot;womb&quot;&quot; (by Jamison/Brereton) and as &quot;go up to &quot;where he lieth&quot;&quot; (by Griffith). A reason given for the discrepancy in translation and interpretation of verse 10.18.7, is that one consonant in a word that meant house, &quot;yonim agree&quot; (&quot;foremost to the &quot;yoni&quot;&quot;), was deliberately changed to a word that meant fire, &quot;yomiagne,&quot; by those who wished to claim scriptural justification.

Dehejia states that Vedic literature has no mention of any practice resembling sati. There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying down beside her dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving and return to the living, then prayer is offered for a happy life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse; its solitary mention may also be explained as an insertion into the text at a latter date. Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati (since killing/self killing) would have been condemned by them.

Professor David Brick of the University of Michigan, in the paper ‘The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning’, writes:
There is no mention of sahagamana (sati) whatsoever in either Vedic literature or any of the early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras. By “early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras”, I refer specifically to both the early Dharmasutras of Apastamba, Hiranyakesin, Gautama, Baudhayana and Vasistha, and the later Dharmasastras of Manu, Narada, and Yajnavalkya.

===Ancient texts===

====Absence in religious texts====
The Brahmana literature, one of the layers within the ancient Vedic texts, dated about 1000 BCE – 500 BCE is entirely silent about sati, according to the historian Altekar. Similarly, the Grhyasutras, a body of texts devoted to ritual, composed at about the same time as the most recent Brahmana literature, sati is not mentioned either. What is mentioned concerning funeral rites, is that the widow is to be brought back from her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre, either by his brother, or by a trusted servant. In the Taittiriya Aranyaka from about the same time, it is said that when leaving, the widow takes from her husband&#x27;s side such objects as his bow, gold and jewels, and hope is expressed that the widow and her relatives lead a happy and prosperous life afterwards. According to Altekar, it is &quot;clear&quot; that the custom of actual widow burning had died out a long time previously.

Nor is the practice of sati mentioned anywhere in the Dharmasutras, texts tentatively dated by Pandurang Vaman Kane to 600–100 BCE, while Patrick Olivelle thinks the parameters should be roughly 250–100 BCE.

Not only is sati not mentioned in Brahmana and early Dharmasastra literature, Satapatha Brahmana explains that suicide/self-murder by anyone is immoral (adharmaic). This Śruti prohibition became one of the several bases for arguments presented against sati by 11th- to 14th-century Hindu scholars such as Medhatithi of Kashmir,

:&quot;Therefore, one should not depart before one&#x27;s natural lifespan.&quot; – Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 10.2.6.7

Thus, in none of the principal religious texts believed to be composed before the Common Era is there any evidence for the sanctioning of the practice of sati; it is wholly unmentioned. However, the archaic Atharvaveda does contain hints of a funeral practice of &quot;symbolic&quot; sati. Also, in the twelfth-century CE commentary of Apararka, claiming to quote the Dharmasutra text Apastamba, it says that if a widow has made a vow of burning herself (anvahorana, &quot;ascend the pyre&quot;), but then &quot;retracts&quot; her vow, she must expiate her sin by the penance ritual called &quot;Prajapatya-vrata&quot;

====Valmiki Ramayana====
The oldest portion of the epic Ramayana, the Valmiki Ramayana, is tentatively dated for its composition by Robert P. Goldman to 750–500 BCE. Anant S. Altekar says that no instances of sati occur in this earliest part of the Ramayana.

According to Ramashraya Sharma, there is no conclusive evidence of the sati practice in the Ramayana. For instance, Tara, Mandodari and the widows of Ravana, all live after their respective husband&#x27;s deaths, though all of them announce their wish to die, while lamenting for their husbands. The first two remarry their brother-in-law. He also mentions that though Dashratha, father of Rama, died soon after his departure from the city, his mothers survived and received him after the completion of his exile. The only instance of sati appears in the &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot; – believed to be a later addition to the original text – in which Kushadhwaja&#x27;s wife performs sati. The Telugu adaptation of the Ramayana, the 14th-century Ranganatha Ramayana, tells that Sulochana, wife of Indrajit, became sati on his funeral pyre.

====Mahabharata====

Instances of sati are found in the Mahabharata, though these instances are also considered as later interpolations by some scholars.

Madri, the second wife of Pandu, immolates herself. She believes she is responsible for his death, as he had been cursed with death if he ever had intercourse. He died while performing the forbidden act with Madri; she blamed herself for not rejecting him, as she knew of the curse. Also, in the case of Madri the entire assembly of rishis (sages) sought to dissuade her from the act, and no religious merit is attached to the fate she chooses against all advice. However, this account is contradicted by the very next stanza found in all versions of the Mahabharata, which states that her dead body and that of her husband were handed over by sages to the Kaurava elders in Hastinapura for the funeral rites. In the Mausala-parvan of the Mahabharata, the four wives of Vasudeva are said to commit sati. Furthermore, as news of Krishna&#x27;s death reaches Hastinapur, five of his wives ascended the funeral pyre, while others embrace ascetism.

Against these stray examples within the Mahabharata of sati, there are scores of instances in the same epic of widows who do not commit sati, and none are blamed for not doing so.

=== Hindu Puranas ===
In Brahma Purana, it is said to be the “highest duty of the woman to immolate herself after her husband.”

=== Hindu Smritis ===
There is no allusion to the custom in Kautilya’s Arthashastra and the Smritis.

The Manusmriti, in fact, emphasized women as &quot;pujarha grhadiptayah,&quot;(worthy of respect), as they are the light that illuminates the household. Manu stated that a virtuous wife, who remains chaste even after her husband&#x27;s death, reaches heaven, just like chaste men.

Daksa Smriti narrates the story of a woman experiencing eternal bliss in heaven by dying alongside her husband on his funeral pyre. The Agni Purana discusses the ability of widows to self-restrain and immolate themselves, allowing them to enter heaven.

Yajnavalkya asserts that sati is the sole path for a chaste widow. A widow who devoted her life to her husband&#x27;s death spends as much time in svarga (heaven) as the hairs on a human body. Vishnu Smriti presents a dilemma: either live a life of chastity or sacrifice one&#x27;s husband&#x27;s pyre.

A passage of the Parasara Smriti says:
:&quot;If a woman adheres to a vow of ascetic celibacy (brahmacarya) after her husband has died, then when she dies, she obtains heaven, just like those who were celibate. Further, three and a half krores or however many hairs are on a human body – for that long a time (in years) a woman who follows her husband (in death) shall dwell in heaven.&quot; — Parasara Smriti, 4.29–31

Neither of these suggest that sati as mandatory, but the Parasara Smriti elaborates the benefits of sati in greater detail.

Within the dharmashastric tradition espousing sati as a justified or even recommended option to ascetic widowhood, there remains a curious conception worth noting - the after-death status of a woman committing sati. Burning herself on the pyre would give her and her husband, automatic, but not eternal, reception into heaven (svarga), whereas only the wholly chaste widow living out her natural lifespan could hope for final liberation (moksha) and the breaking the cycle of saṃsāric rebirth.

While some smriti passages allow sati as optional, others forbid the practice entirely. Vijñāneśvara (c. 1076–1127), an early Dharmaśāstric scholar, claims that many smriti call for the prohibition of sati among Brahmin widows, but not among other social castes. Vijñāneśvara, quoting scriptures from Paithinasi and Angiras to support his argument, states:

:Due to Vedic injunction, a Brahmin woman should not follow her husband in death, but for the other social classes, tradition holds this to be the supreme Law of Women... when a woman of Brahmin caste follows her husband in death, by killing herself she leaders neither herself nor her husband to heaven.

However, as proof of the contradictory opinion of the smriti on sati, in his Mitākṣarā, Vijñāneśvara argues Brahmin women are technically only forbidden from performing sati on pyres other than those of their deceased husbands. Quoting the Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Vijñāneśvara states, &quot;a Brahmin woman ought not to depart by ascending a separate pyre.&quot; David Brick states that the Brahmin sati commentary suggests that the practice may have originated in the warrior and ruling class of medieval Indian society. In addition to providing arguments in support of sati, Vijñāneśvara offers arguments against the ritual.

However, those who supported the ritual did put restrictions on sati. It was considered wrong for women who had young children to care for and those who were pregnant or menstruating. A woman who had doubts or did not wish to commit sati at the last moment could be removed from the pyre by a man, usually a brother of the deceased or someone from her husband&#x27;s side of the family.

David Brick, summarizing the historical evolution of scholarly debate on sati in Medieval India, states:
=== Sanskrit literatures ===
The earliest scholarly discussion of sati is found in Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that it is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in for and against sati.

===Legend of goddess Sati===
Although the myth of the goddess Sati is that of a wife who dies by her own volition on a fire, this is not a case of the practice of sati. The goddess was not widowed, and the myth is quite unconnected with the justifications for the practice.

===Justifications for involuntary sati===
Julia Leslie points to &quot;Strī-dharma-paddhati&quot;, an 18th-century CE text on the duties of the wife by Tryambakayajvan that contains statements she regards as evidence for a sub-tradition that justifies strongly encouraged, pressured, or even forced sati; however the standard view of sati within the justifying tradition is that of the woman who out of moral heroism chooses sati, rather than choosing to enter ascetic widowhood. Tryambaka is quite clear upon the automatic good effect of sati for the woman who was a &#x27;bad&#x27; wife:
Thus, as Leslie puts it, becoming (or being pressured into the role of) a sati was, within &quot;Tryambaka&quot; thinking, the only truly effective method of atonement for the bad wife.

===Exegesis scholarship against sati===
Opposition to sati was expressed by several exegesis scholars: the 9th or 10th-century Kashmiri scholar Medhātithi – who offers the earliest known explicit discussion of sati, the 12th to 17th-century scholars Vijnanesvara, Apararka and Devanadhatta, as well as the mystical Tantric tradition, with its valorisation of the feminine principle.

Explicit criticisms were published by Medhatithi, a commentator on various theological works. He offered two arguments for his opposition. He considered sati a form of suicide, which was forbidden by the Vedas: &quot;One shall not die before the span of one&#x27;s life is run out.&quot; Medhatithi offered a second reason against sati, calling it against dharma (&quot;adharma&quot;). He argued that there is a general prohibition against violence of any form against living beings, especially killing, in the Vedic dharma tradition. Sati causes death, which is self-violence; thus sati is against Vedic teachings.

Vijnanesvara presents both sides of the argument for and against sati. First, he argues that Vedas do not prohibit sacrifice aimed to stop an enemy, or in pursuit of heaven; thus sati for these reasons is not prohibited. Then he presents two arguments against sati, calling it &quot;objectionable&quot;. The first is based on hymn 10.2.6.7 of Satapatha Brahmana will forbids suicide. His second reason against sati is an appeal to the relative merit between two choices. Death may grant a woman&#x27;s wish to enter heaven with her dead husband, but living offers her the possibility of reaching moksha through knowledge of the self through learning, reflecting and meditating. In Vedic tradition, moksha is of higher merit than heaven, because moksha leads to eternal, unsurpassed bliss while heaven is impermanent, thus a smaller happiness. Living gives a widow the option to discover a deeper and totally fulfilling happiness than dying through sati does.

Apararka acknowledges that Vedic scripture prohibits violence against living beings and &quot;one should not kill&quot;, however, he argues that this rule prohibits violence against another person, but does not prohibit killing oneself. Thus sati is a woman&#x27;s choice and it is not prohibited by Vedic tradition.

==In culture==
European artists in the eighteenth century produced many images for their own native markets, showing widows as heroic women and moral exemplars.

In Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, Phileas Fogg rescues Princess Aouda from forced sati.

In M. M. Kaye&#x27;s epic novel of British-Indian &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; the hero Ash rescues his love interest princess Anjuli from sati after the death of her husband, the &quot;Rana&quot; of Bhithor.

In her article &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot;, Indian philosopher Gayatri Spivak discussed the history of sati during the colonial era and how the practise took the form of trapping women in India in a double bind of either self-expression attributed to mental illness and social rejection, or of self-incrimination according to colonial legislation. The woman who commits sati takes the form of the subaltern in Spivak&#x27;s work, a form that much of postcolonial studies take very seriously.

The 2005 novel &quot;The Ashram&quot; by Indian writer Sattar Memon, deals with the plight of an oppressed young woman in India, under pressure to commit sati and the endeavours of a western spiritual aspirant to save her.

In the U.S. version of fictional series The Office (season 3, episode 6) titled &quot;Diwali&quot;, Michael Scott talks about Hindu culture with Kelly&#x27;s parents, and asks specifically if her mother has to die with her husband.

In Krishna Dharabasi&#x27;s Nepali novel &quot;Jhola&quot;, a young widow narrowly escapes self immolation. The novel was later adapted into a movie titled after the book.

Amitav Ghosh&#x27;s &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot; (2008) represents the practice of sati in Ghazipur city in the state of Uttar Pradesh and reflects the feelings and experience of a young woman named &#x27;Deeti&#x27; who escaped the sati that her family and relatives were trying to force her to do after her old husband died.

Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Last Suttee&quot; (1889) recounts how the widowed queen of a Rajput king disguised herself as a nautch girl in order to pass through a line of guards and die upon his pyre.

<text>Shamoke (died 222) was a tribal chieftain who lived in Wuling County (武陵郡; around present-day Changde, Hunan) in the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of China. He allied with the Shu Han state during the Battle of Xiaoting of 221–222 against the Eastern Wu state and was killed in battle.

==Life==
Shamoke was a chieftain among the native tribes living in the Five Creeks (五溪蠻, literally the Barbarians of Five Creeks) of Wuling County (武陵郡; around present-day Changde, Hunan). In 221, Liu Bei, the emperor of the Shu Han state, started the Battle of Xiaoting against his ally-turned-rival Sun Quan, the ruler of the Eastern Wu state. He sent an official, Ma Liang, as an envoy to meet Shamoke and the tribal chiefs Five Creeks tribes and managed to bribe them with wealth and titles to gain their support in the war against Sun Quan. Shamoke was killed in battle in 222 when Sun Quan&#x27;s forces launched a counterattack against Liu Bei&#x27;s forces and dealt them a devastating defeat.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Shamoke appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. His physical appearance is described as follows in the novel: During the Battle of Xiaoting, he encounters the Eastern Wu general Gan Ning, who insists on participating in the battle even though he is ill at the time. When Gan Ning realises that he cannot fight Shamoke due to his condition, he tries to retreat but is fatally shot in the head with an arrow by Shamoke. Later on, when Shamoke gets caught up in the Eastern Wu forces&#x27; fire attack against the Shu Han forces, he attempts to flee the battlefield but the Eastern Wu general Zhou Tai catches up with him and kills him after a brief fight.

<doc id="337666" wikidata="Q232102" url="?curid=337666" title="Two Qiaos">
<text>The Two Qiaos of Jiangdong () were two sisters of the Qiao family who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. In the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the two Qiaos were sisters of exceptional beauty who were the pivot to the Battle of Chibi, one of the most impactful battles of the pre-Three Kingdoms period. Cao Cao, Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty, was described to be interested in having the two sisters, to the point that his intentions were evident in his son&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode to the Bronze Sparrow Platform&quot; (銅雀臺賦); consequently leading Zhou Yu of Jiangdong to go to war with Cao Cao.

==In historical records==
The Qiao sisters&#x27; names were not recorded in history, so in later times they are simply referred to as Da Qiao (literally &quot;older Qiao&quot;) and Xiao Qiao (literally &quot;younger Qiao&quot;). They were from Wan County (皖縣), Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡), which is in present-day Anqing, Anhui. Da Qiao married the warlord Sun Ce, who established the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Xiao Qiao married Zhou Yu, a general who served under Sun Ce and later, under his successor, Sun Quan. Sun Ce jokingly told Zhou Yu: &quot;Although Elder Qiao&#x27;s daughters are exceptionally beautiful, with us as their husbands, it should be a happy enough match.&quot;

Zhou Yu had two sons and a daughter, Zhou Xun, Zhou Yin and Zhou Fei (Lady Zhou). It is unknown if his three children were born to Xiao Qiao.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The Qiao sisters are featured as characters in the 14th-century historical novel, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, the Chinese character for &quot;Qiao&quot; in their names, 橋/桥, is replaced with 喬/乔.

In the novel, the Qiao sisters are the daughters of a certain &quot;Qiao Guolao&quot; (喬國老; literally &quot;State Elder Qiao&quot;), possibly referring to Qiao Xuan. Zhou Yu&#x27;s biography in the third-century historical text, &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms,&quot; did not mention the name of the Qiao sisters&#x27; father, who was simply referred to as &quot;Qiao Gong&quot; (橋公; literally &quot;Elder Qiao&quot; or &quot;Lord Qiao&quot;). Historically, Qiao Xuan died in 184, while the Qiao sisters married Sun Ce and Zhou Yu around 199, so it was not possible that Qiao Xuan was still living when the marriages took place. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Qiao Xuan was the &quot;Qiao Gong&quot; mentioned in Zhou Yu&#x27;s biography. 

In Chapter 44 of the novel, Zhuge Liang tells Zhou Yu that Cao Cao&#x27;s desire to have the Two Qiaos for himself is evident in &quot;Ode to the Bronze Sparrow Platform&quot; (銅雀臺賦), a poem written by Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Zhi. Zhuge Liang recites an altered version of the poem with added verses:

An enraged Zhou Yu then hardens his decision to convince Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao, then prevailing over the latter in the Battle of Chibi. Historically, the battle predates the terrace by two years, and Cao Zhi&#x27;s poem was written two years after Zhou Yu&#x27;s death. Nonetheless, the story of the Bronze Bird Terrace and the Qiao sisters in the popular tradition aroused people&#x27;s imagination for generations.

== In Chinese opera ==
In the opera &quot;Fenghuang Er Qiao&quot;, addresses Xiao Qiao as &quot;Qiao Ching&quot; and Da Qiao as &quot;Qiao Wan&quot;, both ladies are skilled in martial arts. Sun Ce was the protagonist of this opera, he borrows 3,000 troops from Yuan Shu and allies with the Qiao army, which is led by the Two Qiaos. The Qiao&#x27;s father starts a competition for Zhou Yu and Sun Ce to prove they are worthy of marrying them, the Qiao sisters engage in battles with their future husbands. Sun Ce eventually gains Da Qiao&#x27;s hand in marriage through a martial arts contest with the help of Zhou Yu and Xiao Qiao. 

==In popular culture==

=== Films and TV Series ===
Taiwanese supermodel Lin Chi-ling starred as Xiao Qiao in the 2008 Chinese epic war film, &quot;Red Cliff,&quot; directed by John Woo. In the film, it is surmised that Cao Cao&#x27;s infatuation with Xiao Qiao is the reason why he invaded Sun Quan&#x27;s lands and initiated the battle. Chinese actress Huang Yi portrayed Xiao Qiao in &quot;Just Another Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Red Cliff&quot;.

Cai Hancen and Tsai Yi-chen portrayed Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao, respectively, in the 2009 Taiwanese television series, &quot;K.O.3an Guo&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; in a modern high school setting.

Chinese actresses Liu Jing and Zhao Ke portrayed Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao, respectively, in the 2010 Chinese television series, &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

=== Games ===
The Qiao sisters are featured as playable characters in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. The anime &quot;Koihime Musō&quot; and &quot;Ikki Tousen&quot; make references to Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao as well, in which they are known by their respective names in Japanese – Daikyō and Shōkyō.

The Two Qiaos are featured in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot; after 19 March 2020, when the developer Creative Assembly released a DLC under the title of &quot;A World Betrayed&quot;, which gives the Two Qiao official portraits and 3D models with unique abilities.

The Qiaos are featured as &quot;gods&quot; in the Japanese mobile game &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, as part of the Three Kingdoms God series.

<text>Victory Day is a holiday that commemorates the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in 1945. It was first inaugurated in the 15 republics of the Soviet Union following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender late in the evening on 8 May 1945 (9 May Moscow Time). The Soviet government announced the victory early on 9 May after the signing ceremony in Berlin. Although the official inauguration occurred in 1945, the holiday became a non-labor day only in 1965.

In East Germany, 8 May was observed as Liberation Day from 1950 to 1966, and was celebrated again on the 40th anniversary in 1985. In 1967, a Soviet-style &quot;Victory Day&quot; was celebrated on 8 May. Since 2002, the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has observed a commemoration day known as the Day of Liberation from [[National Socialism]], and the End of the [[Second World War]].

The Russian Federation has officially recognized 9 May since its formation in 1991 and considers it a non-working holiday even if it falls on a weekend (in which case any following Monday will be a non-working holiday). The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. Most other countries in Europe observe Victory in Europe Day (often abbreviated to VE Day, or V-E Day) on 8 May, and Europe Day on 9 May as national remembrance or victory days.

==History==

The German Instrument of Surrender was signed twice. An initial document was signed in Reims on 7 May 1945 by Alfred Jodl (chief of staff of the German OKW) for Germany, Walter Bedell Smith, on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and Ivan Susloparov, on behalf of the Soviet High Command, in the presence of French Major-General François Sevez as the official witness. Since the Soviet High Command had not agreed to the text of the surrender, and because Susloparov, a relatively low-ranking officer, was not authorized to sign this document, the Soviet Union requested that a second, revised, instrument of surrender be signed in Berlin. Joseph Stalin declared that the Soviet Union considered the Reims surrender a preliminary document, and Dwight D. Eisenhower immediately agreed with that. Another argument was that some German troops considered the Reims instrument of surrender as a surrender to the Western Allies only, and fighting continued in the East, especially in Prague.

A second surrender ceremony was organized in a surviving manor in the outskirts of Berlin late on 8 May, when it was already 9 May in Moscow due to the difference in time zones. Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of OKW, signed a final German Instrument of Surrender, which was also signed by Marshal Georgy Zhukov, on behalf of the Supreme High Command of the Red Army, and Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, on behalf of the Allied Expeditionary Force, in the presence of General Carl Spaatz and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, as witnesses. The surrender was signed in the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin-Karlshorst. Both English and Russian versions of the instrument of surrender signed in Berlin were considered authentic texts.

The revised Berlin text of the instrument of surrender differed from the preliminary text signed in Reims in explicitly stipulating the complete disarmament of all German military forces, handing over their weapons to local Allied military commanders.

Both the Reims and Berlin instruments of surrender stipulated that forces under German control to cease active operations at 23:01 hours CET on 8 May 1945. However, due to the difference in Central European and Moscow time zones, the end of war is celebrated on 9 May in the Soviet Union and most post-Soviet countries.

To commemorate the victory in the war, the ceremonial Moscow Victory Parade was held in the Soviet capital on 24 June 1945.

==Celebrations==


===In Russia===
During the Soviet Union&#x27;s existence, 9 May was celebrated throughout it and in the Eastern Bloc. Though the holiday was introduced in many Soviet republics between 1946 and 1950, it became a non-working day only in the Ukrainian SSR in 1963 and the Russian SFSR in 1965. In the Russian SFSR, a weekday off (usually a Monday) was given if 9 May fell on a Saturday or Sunday.

The celebration of Victory Day continued during subsequent years. The war became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts. The ritual of the celebration gradually obtained a distinctive character with a number of similar elements: ceremonial meetings, speeches, lectures, receptions and fireworks.

In Russia during the 1990s, the 9 May holiday was not celebrated with large Soviet-style mass demonstrations due to the policies of successive Russian governments. Following Vladimir Putin&#x27;s rise to power, the Russian government began promoting the prestige of the governing regime and history, and national holidays and commemorations became a source of national self-esteem. Victory Day in Russia has become a celebration in which popular culture plays a central role. The 60th and 70th anniversaries of Victory Day in Russia (2005 and 2015) became the largest popular holidays since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1995, as the world celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, many world leaders converged on Moscow to attend the city&#x27;s first state sponsored ceremonies since the end of the Soviet Union. In 2015 around 30 leaders, including those of China and India, attended the 2015 celebration, while Western leaders boycotted the ceremonies because of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The 2020 edition of the parade, marking the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Russophone populations in many countries celebrate the holiday regardless of its local status, organize public gatherings and even parades on this day. Some multilanguage broadcasting television networks translate the &quot;Victory speech&quot; of the Russian president and the parade on Red Square for telecasts for viewers all over the globe, making the parade one of the world&#x27;s most watched events of the year. RT also broadcasts the parade featuring live commentary, and also airs yet another highlight of the day – the Minute of Silence at 6:55pm MST, a tradition dating back to 1965.

Because of massive losses among both military and civilians during World War II, Victory Day is one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia.

===Other countries currently celebrating 9 May===
* Armenia has officially recognized 9 May since its independence in 1991. It is officially known as Victory and Peace Day. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. Shushi Liberation Day is also commemorated with the holiday.
* Azerbaijan has officially recognized 9 May since 1994. Upon its independence in 1991, the Azerbaijani Popular Front Party and later the government of Abulfaz Elchibey deliberately erased the holiday from the calendar, with veterans being subjected to a targeted anti-Russian/Soviet media campaign. Upon coming to power, Heydar Aliyev restored the holiday to the national calendar. The holiday is similarly celebrated as it was while the country was part of the Soviet Union. A wreath laying ceremony is usually held at the monument to Hazi Aslanov.
* Belarus has officially recognized 9 May since its independence in 1991 and considers it a non-working day. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. Belarus has had five Victory Day Parades on Masherov Avenue (1995, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020) and has had an annual ceremony on Victory Square since independence.
* Bosnia and Herzegovina has officially recognized 9 May since its independence. However, it is not a working day only in Republic of Srpska.
* Georgia has officially recognized 9 May since its independence in 1991. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. It is particularly celebrated in this way with the Russian community in the country.
* In Israel, Victory Day on 9 May has historically been celebrated as an unofficial national remembrance day. However, in 2017, Victory in Europe Day was upgraded to the status of an official national holiday day of commemoration by the Knesset, with schools and businesses operating as usual. As a result of immigration of many Red Army veterans, Israel now hosts the largest and most extensive Victory Day celebrations outside the former Soviet Union. Traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants.
* Kazakhstan has officially recognized 9 May since its independence in 1991 as a national holiday. The holiday is sometimes celebrated in connection with the Defender of the Fatherland Day holiday on 7 May. From 1947 the holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. 
* Kyrgyzstan has officially recognised 9 May since its independence in 1991. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. 
* Mongolia had officially recognized 9 May during its existence as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. The holiday continues to be celebrated unofficially throughout the country.
* Montenegro officially recognised 9 May as Victory Day over Fascism as an official holiday.
* Serbia celebrates 9 May as Victory Day over Fascism but it is a working holiday. Still many people gather to mark the anniversary with the war veterans, including the President, Minister of Defense and the highest officers of the Serbian Armed Forces.
* Tajikistan has officially recognised 9 May since its independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union.
* Turkmenistan has officially recognised 9 May since its independence in 1991. It officially known as the Day of Remembrance of National Heroes of Turkmenistan in the 1941–1945 World War. It was established by a special decree of President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov in 2000. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. Since 2018, it has not been a public holiday. Various events are conducted at famous parks such as Altyn Asyr Park and the National Cultural Centre&#x27;s Palace of Mukams. In recent years, Turkmen prisoners have received pardons from the President of Turkmenistan on Victory Day.
* Uzbekistan has officially recognised 9 May from 2 March 1999, where the holiday was introduced as the &quot;Day of Remembrance and Honour&quot; (&quot;Xotira va Qadirlash Kuni&quot;). It is the only country in the Commonwealth of Independent States to not officially recognize the 9 May holiday as Victory Day. Under President Islam Karimov, the holiday was toned down, with many veterans being told not to wear their Soviet-era decorations or uniforms on the holiday. Since Karimov&#x27;s death in 2016, the holiday has been celebrated there similarly to how it was celebrated while the country was part of the Soviet Union.

===Countries formerly celebrating 9 May===
* Bulgaria officially recognized 9 May during its existence as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Since 1989, all official celebrations of 9 May have been cancelled. As in other EU countries, Victory Day in Bulgaria is 8 May, whereas 9 May is Europe Day. However, many still gather unofficially to celebrate Victory Day on 9 May. Flowers are generally laid at the Monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia.
* Moldova officially recognized 9 May as a public holiday from its independence in 1991 to 2023. From 1951 to 1991, the holiday had also been celebrated during the country&#x27;s rule by the Soviet Union as the Moldavian SSR. It is now officially known as the &quot;Victory Day and Commemoration of the Fallen Heroes for the Independence of the Fatherland&quot; (). Victory Day was a major national holiday, particularly due to Moldova&#x27;s Russian community and also due to the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM) and its state-sponsored Victory Day rallies of 2017 on the Great National Assembly Square at Chișinău. Wreath-laying ceremonies were commonly held at the Eternity Memorial Complex of Chișinău during the day.
* Poland officially recognised 9 May as a state holiday, where it was known as &quot;Narodowe Święto Zwycięstwa i Wolności&quot; (&quot;National Victory and Freedom Day&quot;) from 1945 until 2015. Until 1950 it was also a day free from work. The holiday served both as a celebration of victory against Nazi Germany as well as to highlight the union between the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and the USSR. It was a key celebration that was observed with parades and major events throughout the entire country. Since the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the holiday had become controversial in Poland. Since 24 April 2015, Poland officially recognised &quot;Narodowy Dzień Zwycięstwa&quot; (&quot;National Victory Day&quot;) on 8 May (like Victory in Europe Day) in place of the previous holiday. However, some military units together with local governments still organise their own festivities on 9 May and the Russian minority in Poland continue to celebrate this date.
* Romania officially recognized Victory Day as a public holiday during the communist era. Since Romania&#x27;s 1877 independence day from the Ottoman Empire also coincides with Victory Day on 9 May, the holiday was made a double celebration, especially under Nicolae Ceaușescu who sought to portray communism in Romania as a continuation of Romania&#x27;s independence struggles from previous centuries. Victory Day in Romania is now celebrated on 8 May, whereas 9 May is celebrated as Europe Day. However, some Russophiles, Eurosceptics and leftists gather at informal meetings to celebrate Victory Day on 9 May. Thus, it may mark a triple celebration in the country.
* Ukraine officially recognised 9 May from its independence in 1991 until 2013, where it was a non-working day. If it fell on a weekend the following Monday was non-working. The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. According to opinion polling by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, in 2010 almost 60% of Ukrainians considered Victory Day one of the biggest holidays of Ukraine. In 2015 Ukraine started to officially celebrate Victory Day over Nazism in World War II on 9 May, per a decree of parliament (the Verkhovna Rada). Additionally the term &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; as a reference was replaced with &quot;Second World War&quot; in all Ukrainian legislation. Since 15 May 2015 Communist and Nazi symbols are prohibited in Ukraine. Before 15 May 2015, Ukraine held military parades in the capital on Khreshchatyk in 1995, 2001, 2010, and 2011, and 2013. On May 8, 2023, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree according to which Ukraine would celebrate Europe Day on May 9, and submitted to the Verkhovna Rada a bill establishing May 8, the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939 – 1945, as a day off instead of Victory Day over Nazism in World War II on May 9. On May 29, 2023, the Verkhovna Rada made the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939 – 1945 on May 8 as a public holiday, canceling the Victory Day over Nazism in World War II on May 9. In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, only 13% of Ukrainians were ready to celebrate May 9. According to a study conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in February 2024, 11% of Ukrainians celebrate Victory Day as the most popular holiday, while Christmas is 70%, Easter is 68% and New Year is 47%. Sociologists note that in 2010, Victory Day on May 9 was one of the most important holidays, as 58% of Ukrainians thought so. However, already in 2021, only 30% of Ukrainians considered it an important holiday. The decline in the popularity of Victory Day in Ukraine is explained by the fact that this day is very actively celebrated in Russia as a militaristic holiday.

===Unrecognized states celebrating Victory Day===

* Abkhazia has officially recognised 9 May since its declaration of independence in 1990. From 1951 the holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union.
* South Ossetia has officially recognised 9 May since its declaration of independence in 1990. From 1951 the holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union.
* Transnistria has officially recognised 9 May since its declaration of independence in 1990. From 1951 the holiday was similarly celebrated there while the polity was part of the Soviet Union.

===Former states===
* From 1948 to 1993, the communist-dominated Czechoslovak Socialist Republic celebrated the holiday on 9 May in concert with the Soviet Union. Then, it was mainly celebrated with a military parade of the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army (ČSLA) on Letná every five years to mark the end of World War II and the anniversary of the Prague uprising (the first one took place in 1951 while the last of these parades took place in 1985). Since the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Czech Republic has officially recognized 8 May as Liberation Day (&quot;Den osvobození&quot;). In recent years the Prague uprising and liberation of Plzeň by American troops have been commemorated on 5 May.
* The German Democratic Republic recognized &quot;Tag der Befreiung&quot; (Day of liberation) on 8 May, it was celebrated as a public holiday from 1950 to 1966, and on the 40th anniversary in 1985. Only in 1975 was the official holiday on 9 May instead and that year called &quot;Tag des Sieges&quot; (Victory Day). In Federal Republic of Germany, events are held on 8 May to commemorate those who fought against Nazism and died in World War II. Also, on 8 May, the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern since 2002 has recognised a commemorative day &quot;Tag der Befreiung vom Nationalsozialismus und der Beendigung des 2. Weltkrieges&quot; (Day of Liberation from National Socialism, and the End of the Second World War).
* Soviet Union celebrated 9 May since 1945, with the day becoming a public holiday since 1965 in some Soviet Republics.
* officially recognised 9 May from 1965 to its disestablishment after the Yugoslav Wars. The first victory parade was held on Bulevar revolucije in the presence of Marshal Josip Broz Tito in 1965 and was held every 5 years since (save for 1980) until the final parade in 1985.

===Former unrecognized states===
* The Republic of Artsakh had officially recognised 9 May since its declaration of independence in 1991. From 1951 the holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. It coincided with the country&#x27;s Liberation Day, celebrating the Armenian victory in the Capture of Shushi.

===Holiday traditions===
====Victory Day Parades====


Victory Day Parades are military parades that are held on 9 May, particularly in various post-soviet nations such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and until 2015, Ukraine. Outside of the former Soviet Union, military victory parades have also been held in Serbia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The first victory day parade on Red Square took place with the participation of the Red Army and a small detachment from the First Polish Army on 24 June 1945. After a 20-year hiatus, the parade was held again and became a regular tradition among Eastern Bloc countries and Soviet allies. Countries that had this tradition included Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, both of which had their last parades in 1985. After the fall of the Soviet Union, they quickly fell out of style in Europe and soon became a practice among post-Soviet nations, many of which have large Russian populations. In 1995, Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine held parades for the first time since 1991.

====Mass processions====
In Belarus on non-jubilee years, a procession is held from October Square, which ends with the laying of wreaths on Victory Square. In 2015, a parade of young people, cadets of military lyceums, young athletes took place on Bishkek&#x27;s Ala-Too Square, attended by President Almazbek Atambayev and Prime Minister Temir Sariev.
The Immortal Regiment () is a massive civil event staged in major cities in Russia and around the world every 9 May. Since it was introduced in 2012, it has been conducted in cities such as Moscow, Washington D.C., Dushanbe, Berlin, and Yekaterinburg. Participants carry pictures of relatives or family members who served during the Second World War. The front line of the procession carries a banner with the words &quot;Bessmertniy Polk&quot; written on it. Up to 12 million Russians have participated in the march nationwide in recent years. Since 2015, the President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials have participated in the procession in Moscow. It has come under criticism by those who charge that participants are carrying photographs and discarding them after the event.

====Gatherings at monuments====
Members of government usually take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at their national war memorial, usually dedicated to the specific war victory. Wreaths are often laid at memorials such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow), the Monument to the Unknown Sailor (Odesa), and the Monument to Hazi Aslanov (Baku). Although Latvia does not officially recognize 9 May, most of the large Russian community informally celebrates the holiday, with trips to the Victory Memorial to Soviet Army being common in Riga, with some diplomats (ambassadors of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus) as well as some politicians (Nils Ušakovs, Alfrēds Rubiks) also taking part. On 20 April 2023 the Latvian Parliament passed a bill to ban all public celebrations on May 9, the only exception being Europe Day. The law was meant to stop the &quot;glorification of warfare and to stem the propagandist distortions of World War II history often implicit in Victory Day celebrations.&quot;

====Religious commemorations====
In the Easter message of 1945, the Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow wrote:

Every 26 April (Old Style, O.S.; 9 May, New Style or N.S.), the Russian Orthodox Church commemorates the dead, being the only special remembrance day for the dead with a fixed date. After the liturgy, a memorial service for the fallen soldiers is served in all churches and monasteries of the Orthodox Church. The annual commemoration on Victory Day &quot;of the soldiers who for faith, the Fatherland and the people laid down their lives and all those who died in the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945&quot; was established by the Bishops&#x27; Council of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1994. On the eve of the 65th anniversary in 2010, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow gave his blessing for all the churches of the Russian Orthodox Church to perform a &quot;prayer service in memory of the deliverance of our people from a terrible, mortal enemy, from a danger that our Fatherland has not known in all history&quot;. The patriarch composed a special prayer for this rite, taking as a basis the prayer of Philaret Drozdov, written in honor of the victory of the Imperial Russian Army over the French Grande Armee during the Napoleonic Wars. The completion of the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces was timed to Victory Day in 2020.

====Other events====
Traditions such as the Victory Relay Race are held on jubilee anniversaries. In 2013, Turkmenistan conducted live-fire military exercises &quot;Galkan-2013&quot; (Shield-2013) dedicated to the 68th anniversary of the Victory, observed by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov at the Kelyata Training Center of the Ministry of Defence of Turkmenistan in the Bäherden District of the Ahal Region. In 2016, Moldovan Defence Minister Anatol Șalaru attended a display of vehicles from the Moldovan National Army and the United States Army in the central park of Chișinău. In April 2020, an official in the Western Military District of Russia announced that an air show would be held at Kubinka air base in Victory Day.

On Victory Day, many books on topics such as the war such as Panfilov&#x27;s Twenty-Eight Guardsmen are published. On the eve of the diamond jubilee, President Vladimir Putin, at the request of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, gave a live address broadcast Austrian TV channel ORF.

==Soviet and post-Soviet symbols associated with Victory Day==
===Banner of Victory===
The Victory Banner refers to the Soviet military banner raised by the Soviet soldiers on the Reichstag building in Berlin on 1 May 1945. Made during the Battle of Berlin by soldiers who created it while under battlefield conditions, it has historically been the official symbol of the Victory of the Soviet people against Nazi Germany. Being the 5th banner to be created, it was the only army flag that was prepared to be raised in Berlin to survive the battle. The Cyrillic inscription on the banner reads: &quot;150th Rifle, Order of Kutuzov 2nd class, Idritsa Division, 79th Rifle Corps, 3rd Shock Army, 1st Belorussian Front&quot;, representing the unit that soldiers who raised the banner were from. On 9 May, a specially made replica of the Victory Banner is carried by a color guard of the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant&#x27;s Regiment through Red Square. The Victory Banner was brought to Kyiv from Moscow in October 2004 to take part in the parade in honor of the 60th Anniversary of the Liberation of Ukraine. In 2015, the banner was brought to Astana to participate in the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade on 7 May.

===Saint George&#x27;s Ribbon===
The Ribbon of Saint George is a military symbol that dates back to the era of the Russian Empire. It consists of a black and orange bicolour pattern, with three black and two orange stripes. 
In the early 21st century, it became an awareness ribbon to commemorate the veterans of the war, being recognized as a patriotic symbol. In countries such as Ukraine and the Baltic states, it has been associated recently with Russophilia and Russian irredentism. It has become especially associated with Russian support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In Ukraine the government chose to replace it with the remembrance poppy which is associated with the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth.

<text>The University of Ingolstadt was founded in 1472 by Louis the Rich, the Duke of Bavaria at the time, and its first Chancellor was the Bishop of Eichstätt. It consisted of four faculties: theology, law, artes liberales  and medicine, all of which were contained in the &quot;Hoheschule&quot; (&#x27;high school&#x27;). The university was modeled after the University of Vienna. Its chief goal was the propagation of the Christian faith. The university closed in May 1800, by order of the Prince-elector Maximilian IV (later Maximilian I, King of Bavaria).

==Pre-Reformation==
In its first several decades, the university grew rapidly, opening colleges not only for philosophers from the realist and nominalist schools, but also for poor students wishing to study the liberal arts. Among its most famous instructors in the late 15th century were the poet Conrad Celtes, the Hebrew scholar Johannes Reuchlin, and the Bavarian historian Johannes Thurmair (also known as &quot;Johannes Aventinus&quot;).

The Illuminati movement was founded on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt (Upper Bavaria), by Jesuit-taught Adam Weishaupt (d. 1830), who was the first lay professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt. The movement was made up of freethinkers, as an offshoot of the Enlightenment. Writers at the time, such as Seth Payson, believed the movement represented a conspiracy to infiltrate and overthrow the governments of European states. Some writers, such as Augustin Barruel and John Robison, even claimed that the Illuminati were behind the French Revolution, a claim that Jean-Joseph Mounier dismissed in his 1801 book &quot;On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France&quot;.

The group&#x27;s adherents were given the name &quot;Illuminati&quot;, although they called themselves &quot;Perfectibilists&quot;. The group has also been called the Illuminati Order and the Bavarian Illuminati, and the movement itself has been referred to as Illuminism (after illuminism). In 1777, Karl Theodor became ruler of Bavaria. He was a proponent of Enlightened Despotism and, in 1784, his government banned all secret societies, including the Illuminati.

During the period when the Illuminati was legally allowed to operate, many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was number two in the operation and was found with much of the group&#x27;s documentation when his home was searched. The Illuminati&#x27;s members pledged obedience to their superiors, and were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees. The order had its branches in most countries of the European continent; it reportedly had around 2,000 members over the span of ten years. The organization had its attraction for literary men, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar. Weishaupt had modeled his group to some extent on Freemasonry, and many Illuminati chapters drew membership from existing Masonic lodges. Internal rupture and panic over succession preceded its downfall, which was effected by the Secular Edict made by the Bavarian government in 1785.

==The Reformation and its aftermath==
The Lutheran movement took an early hold in Ingolstadt, but was quickly put to flight by one of the chief figures of the Counter-Reformation: Johann Eck, who made the university a bastion for the traditional Catholic faith in southern Germany. In Eck&#x27;s wake, many Jesuits were appointed to key positions in the school, and the university, over most of the 17th century, gradually came fully under the control of the Jesuit order. Noted scholars of this period include the theologian Gregory of Valentia, the astronomer Christopher Scheiner (inventor of the helioscope), Johann Baptist Cysat, and the poet Jacob Balde. The Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II received his education at the university.

==Relocation==
The 18th century gave rise to the Enlightenment, a movement that in some quarters was opposed to the church-run universities of which Ingolstadt was a prime example. The Jesuits gradually left the university as it sought to change with the times, until the university finally had become so secular that the greatest influence in Ingolstadt was Adam Weishaupt, founder of the secret society of the Illuminati. On November 25, 1799, the elector Maximilian IV announced that the university&#x27;s depleted finances had become too great a weight for him to bear: the university would be moved to Landshut as a result. The university finished that year&#x27;s school term, and left Ingolstadt in May 1800, bringing to a quiet end the school that had, at its peak, been one of the most influential and powerful institutes of higher learning in Europe. In 1826 King Ludwig I moved the university to the capital Munich (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich). Subsequently, another institution of higher learning was established in Ingolstadt, now called the WFI - Ingolstadt School of Management (founded in 1989 as part of the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt), one of Germany&#x27;s foremost business schools.

==In popular culture==
Victor Frankenstein from Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was a fictional student at the University of Ingolstadt. In the 1931 film adaptation, the school is called Goldstadt Medical College. Goldstadt University is also featured in the novelization of &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (but in this, it is in Romania).

<text>Vålerenga Fotball () is a Norwegian professional football club from Oslo, and a part of the multi-sport club Vålerengens IF. The club currently competes in the Eliteserien after being promoted from the Norwegian First Division in 2024. Founded in 1913, the club is named after the neighbourhood of Vålerenga. Vålerenga&#x27;s home ground is Intility Arena, located in Valle-Hovin. Vålerenga are five-time league champions and four-time Norwegian Football Cup champions, having last won the league in 2005 and the cup in 2008. Vålerenga is generally considered to be the largest football club in Oslo, and they are known for their loyal supporters. 

==History==
===Early days (1913–45)===
The history of Vålerenga Fotball goes back to &quot;Fotballpartiet Spark&quot;, which was founded in 1898 by pastor Hans Møller Gasmann. An early mission for Gasmann was to give the local youth social activity and exercise. On a larger scale, the club was part of the movement known as Muscular Christianity. A successor to this football club, &quot;Idrettslaget Spring&quot;, was founded on 29 July 1913 by a group of teenage factory workers. A year later, the club changed its name to &quot;Vaalerengens Idrættsforening&quot;. Rooted in the neighborhood of Vålerenga on the east end of Oslo, the club would recruit players and supporters from the many workers in the area, in a society then characterized for its low mobility between social strata. Within its first seasons, Vålerengen would compete with the major clubs in Oslo at that time; Lyn, Mercantile and Frigg. Where Lyn and Frigg had a strong identity with the academia and the upper classes, Vålerengen developed a working class identity.

Vålerengens Idrettsforening had mixed success in its first years, but fortunes improved as the 1920s came around and the club secured promotion to the Oslo Championships in 1921. Vålerengen won the Oslo Championships four times before a national league (Norgesserien) was established in 1937. In the 1948–49 season, Vålerengen finished second.

After this period, Vålerengen entered a period of instability, being relegated from the top division two times in the 1950s.

===The Bohemians (1946–68)===

The charismatic Helmuth Steffens became a central figure in building up the culture in the club after the war. At the beginning of the 1960s, a new generation of local players broke into Vålerengen&#x27;s first squad. Players like Einar Bruno Larsen, Terje Hellerud and Leif Eriksen became core personalities of a group of players which eventually became known as &quot;Bohemene&quot; (&quot;The Bohemians&quot;). The club would become known for its brilliant style of football as the number of people in the audience increased. The players became popular for their charismatic, witty comments and light hearted humour. Vålerengen secured a third place in 1961.

In 1965, Vålerengen won the First Division for the first time. By the help of manager Helmuth Steffens and head coach Anton Ploderer, the club had managed to win the title with a team of local players. The league was won in dramatic fashion, with arch-rivals Lyn giving Vålerengen a fight for the title until the final matches of the season.

The Bohemian era came to an end when the club was relegated from the First Division in 1968 and then again to the Third Division in 1970. Vålerengen did not achieve promotion to the top league again until 1974. In 1976, Vålerenga signed Odd Iversen, who at the time had 112 First Division goals to his name. Iversen would help the club reestablish itself in the First Division.

===The glory years (1977–86)===
The 80s saw the emergence of a new generation. With the help of players like Tom Jacobsen and Vidar Davidsen, Vålerengen would win its first cup title in 1980.

Led by head coach Leif Eriksen, the team won the First Division title for the second time in 1981 with a style of play characterized by intensity and discipline. The club was unable to reclaim the league title in 1982, but won it again in 1983 and 1984. During the decade, Vålerengen would also become twice runners-up in the cup and also achieve a third place in the league in 1985. Vålerengen had become a stable top team for the first and, to date, only time.

1985 also saw the signing of striker Jørn Andersen, who would go on to score 23 goals in 22 matches in his sole season for Vålerengen. However, as the club had miscalculated the home crowd average, the club entered severe financial difficulties. Vålerenga was saved from bankruptcy in 1987.

===Ups and downs (1987–2003)===
In 1990, now known as Vålerenga, the club was relegated after 14 seasons in the top division. Vålerenga was close to further relegation in the 1992 season, but managed to remain in the second highest division thanks to a last round 3–0 win against Eik-Tønsberg IF. In 1994, Vålerenga returned to the top division, but were relegated again in 1996. In 1997 Vålerenga won the cup and the 1. divisjon and were again promoted to Tippeligaen. As earlier in the 1990s, the stay in the top division lasted only a few years.
In the 2000 season Vålerenga lost the play-off matches against Sogndal and was relegated to the 1. divisjon. Vålerenga returned to Tippeligaen and won the cup in 2002.

The 2003 season was poor for Vålerenga and they wound up third last in the league sending them into play-offs against Sandefjord to avoid relegation. The result was a 0–0 draw in Sandefjord and a 5–3 victory in Oslo and so Vålerenga retained the position in the top league and avoided relegation.

===Success, disappointments and troubles (2004–12)===
Vålerenga rebounded nicely in the 2004 season and proved a serious challenge to the dominant Rosenborg team in the bid for the league&#x27;s gold medal. After a frantic final round where Vålerenga beat Stabæk 3–0, they missed out on the league title since Rosenborg beat FK Lyn, Vålerenga&#x27;s city rivals 4–1. Vålerenga won the silver medal, finishing 2nd to Rosenborg equal on points and goal difference, but Vålerenga had scored fewer goals than Rosenborg during the season, leaving Rosenborg as league champions.

At the start of the 2005 season it was apparent that Rosenborg was in bad shape and it seemed like Vålerenga&#x27;s season to go all the way. After a strong season opening, the surprise of the season IK Start – newly promoted to the Tippeligaen – looked to give Vålerenga a fight to the finish, and the two clubs basically alternated on leading the series to the final round. On 29 October it looked to be a thrilling last round reminiscent of the previous year, as both Start and Vålerenga had exactly the same number of points, but Start with a slightly better goal difference. Start met Fredrikstad FK at home, while Vålerenga met Odd Grenland away. Eventually Fredrikstad, who faced relegation if they lost, beat Start 3–1 while at the same time Vålerenga managed a 2–2 draw against Odd Grenland. Vålerenga stepped one up from the previous year, and won the title with a one-point margin. The title was Vålerenga&#x27;s first league title in 21 years, ending Rosenborg&#x27;s 13-year reign as league champions.
The follow-up season of 2006 did not start out as well for the reigning champions, and a poor start left them at the bottom of the table after seven rounds, having gained only 5 points. A steady rise in form though still brought the team to 6th place by the time the season was half-through. Late July brought a string of bad results, including embarrassing losses to main rival FK Lyn, and the exit from the UEFA Champions League, after losing 5–3 on aggregate to Czech club Mladá Boleslav in the 2nd qualifying round. Vålerenga had aimed to qualify for the tournament after missing out the previous year by being defeated by Belgian side Club Brugge on a penalty shoot-out. After losing five out of seven games between 22 July and 19 August head-coach Kjetil Rekdal announced his resignation. Assistant coach Petter Myhre took over as interim manager, and as a result the club regained their form and scored 25 out of the last 30 possible points, bringing the club to a third place in the league, as well as a qualification spot for the 2007–08 Europa League. Vålerenga also qualified for play in the 2006–07 Scandinavian Royal League after finishing among the top four teams in Norway. In October 2006, Petter Myhre was hired on a permanent basis, but he would resign in July 2007, following a string of bad results.

In November 2007, Martin Andresen signed a three-year contract to become the next manager of Vålerenga. Heavy investment from owners and investors saw the signing of several high-profile players, most notably Lars Iver Strand and Kristoffer Hæstad. However, despite winning the 2008 Norwegian Football Cup, the following season was a disappointment, with Vålerenga finishing 10th in the league. In the 2009 season, Vålerenga finished 7th, reaching the semifinal in the cup. 2010 saw a revitalized Vålerenga, led by a trio of effective forwards, Mohammed Abdellaoue, Bengt Sæternes and Luton Shelton. Vålerenga finished second in the league.

However, Vålerenga could not repeat the success in 2011 and 2012. In October 2012, Andresen and Vålerenga agreed to part ways.

===A new era (2013–present)===
Kjetil Rekdal returned to the club as head coach in January 2013. Facing economic difficulties from previous seasons and being without a shirt sponsorship deal, Vålerenga spent much of the 2014 season dealing with a severe risk of bankruptcy, finally signing a new shirt sponsorship deal with DnB on 29 July. The signing of striker Vidar Örn Kjartansson in front of 2014 season proved to be a huge success, with the Icelandic player scoring 25 goals in 29 games, helping the Oslo club secure a sixth place in the league after a drop in form in the latter half of the season.

On 13 July 2016, Ronny Deila was appointed as the new head coach. Deila was originally planned to take over in January 2017, but was involved in the coaching team for the final games of the 2016 season. Kjetil Rekdal was to become director of sports, but left the club in early 2017. In December 2019, Ronny Deila left to become the coach of New York City Football Club. In January 2020, Dag-Eilev Fagermo became the new head coach.

Vålerenga moved into their newly built stadium, Intility Arena, in September 2017. This was a historic move for the club, after spending 104 years without owning a home stadium. The new stadium is also close to Vålerenga neighborhood of Oslo.

==Colours==

Up to 1913, Vålerenga&#x27;s kit was moss green. In 1914, the Norwegian State Railways had a set of blue and red kits left over, which Vålerenga bought cheaply, so their official colours became blue and red. The 2006 season away kit was white with a touch of moss green.

==Stadium==
In 2017, Vålerenga opened their own home ground at Valle Hovin in Eastern Oslo, called Intility Arena. The stadium has a capacity of 17,333 on domestic games (15,389 on international games), and the playing surface is artificial grass. The very first match in the ground saw the Vålerenga women&#x27;s team beat Kolbotn Fotball 2–0 on 9 September 2017, with Stephanie Verdoia being the first ever goalscorer on the Arena. The next day, the men&#x27;s team lost 2–1 to Sarpsborg 08 in their first game at the stadium. The ground was first called Vålerenga kultur- og idrettspark, before the club agreed a contract with the IT company Intility to rename the stadium.

===The construction of the new arena===
Following a press statement made on 15 May 2008, Vålerenga announced that they would be moving home to Valle Hovin after purchasing the area of the proposed stadium for the symbolic sum of 1 Norwegian Krone. In late 2014, the plans were accepted by the city council of Oslo. On 10 June 2014, the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority accepted the plans for the stadium.

The foundation stone of the new stadium was laid on 29 July 2015, the club&#x27;s 102nd anniversary. Construction was begun in the summer of 2015 and is planned to be completed in 2017.

===Stadium history===
Before moving into Intility Arena, the Ullevaal Stadion was the home ground, a stadium owned jointly by the Football Association of Norway and Vital Eiendom.

From the 1960s till the 1980s and a short period in the end of the 1990s Bislett Stadium was Vålerenga&#x27;s home ground. Bislett Stadium also hosted speed skating and track and field events in addition to football, and hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics. Poor conditions and maintenance of Bislett forced Vålerenga to move to Ullevaal and a groundshare with FK Lyn.

After Vålerenga moved from Bislett Stadium plans for building their own ground were conceived, but poor results on the field combined with financial problems kept those plans at bay for a few years. After the second place in 2004 and the league title in 2005 as well as business man John Fredriksen&#x27;s deletion of the club&#x27;s debt in 2003, the talks of building a ground for Vålerenga resurfaced.

==Supporters==
Vålerenga has traditionally drawn support from the area around Vålerenga, Oslo and various other places on the east end of Oslo, although today these lines are largely blurred and the club has supporters all over Oslo and the surrounding areas. Up until the early 90s, Vålerenga&#x27;s supporters were loosely organised. The supporters were sometimes referred to as &quot;Apeberget&quot;, but this is actually a misnomer from a journalist. An independent supporter club called &quot;Klanen&quot; (&quot;The Clan&quot;) was founded in 1991. It has around 10,000 members today. The senior team of Vålerenga has reserved shirt number 12 for their supporters. Vålerenga&#x27;s supporters, and specifically Klanen, are widely considered to be the best football supporters in Norway.

===Rivalries===

Vålerenga&#x27;s main rivals include Lillestrøm, Ham Kam, Kongsvinger, Brann and Lyn. Since the 90s, the main supporter club has actively worked hard for social issues and against hooliganism. Despite this, as recently as 2019, isolated individuals within the club&#x27;s support have engaged in disruptive and dangerous activities during live matches.

<doc id="337688" wikidata="Q187506" url="?curid=337688" title="Honoré Daumier">
<text>Honoré-Victorin Daumier (; February 26, 1808 – February 10 or 11, 1879) was a French painter, sculptor, and printmaker, whose many works offer commentary on the social and political life in France, from the Revolution of 1830 to the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870. He earned a living producing caricatures and cartoons in newspapers and periodicals such as &quot;La Caricature&quot; and &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, for which he became well known in his lifetime and is still remembered today. He was a republican democrat (working class liberal), who satirized and lampooned the monarchy, politicians, the judiciary, lawyers, the bourgeoisie, as well as his countrymen and human nature in general. 

Daumier was a serious painter, loosely associated with realism, sometimes blurring the boundaries between caricature and fine art. Although he occasionally exhibited at the Parisian Salon, his paintings were largely overlooked and ignored by the French public and critics of the day. Yet Daumier&#x27;s fellow painters, as well as the poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire, noticed and greatly admired his work. Later generations would recognize Daumier as one of the great French artists of the 19th century, profoundly influencing a younger generation of impressionist and postimpressionist painters. Daumier was a tireless and prolific artist and produced more than 100 sculptures, 500 paintings, 1,000 drawings, 1,000 wood engravings, and 4,000 lithographs. 

Daumier came from a poor family and was working by the age of 12, first at a , then at a bookstore frequented by artists where he began to draw. He received some mentorship from Alexandre Lenoir, attended the Académie Suisse, learned lithography, and was producing advertisements, illustrations, and caricatures by the time he was twenty. After the July Revolution of 1830 he begin working for satirical political papers that were highly critical of the new monarch Louis Philippe I and his court. He was jailed for several months in 1832 after the publication of &quot;Gargantua&quot;, a particularly offensive depiction of the King, Louis Philippe. After his release Daumier resumed publishing political lithographs until the September Laws were passed in 1835, limiting the freedom of the press. Afterwards, his cartoons softened, the bourgeoisie and daily Parisian life were more frequent subjects, and when political subjects did appear they were oblique and vailed. Daumier experienced financial hardships and debt throughout much of his life.
Daumier married Alexandrine Dassy in 1846 and moved to the Île Saint-Louis where they lived until 1863. He increasingly associated with writers, poets, painters, and sculptors there, including Baudelaire, Corot, Courbet, Delacroix among others, and began to paint in earnest. He spent his summers from 1853 onward in Barbizon and Valmondois, where artists of the Barbizon school and realist movement worked. As his desire to paint intensified, his enthusiasm for cartooning declined, as did his popularity with the public. &quot;Le Charivari&quot; stopped publishing his comics in 1860. A period of financial hardship followed, and from 1863–1865 he moved to a series of lodgings around Montmartre and lost contact with many friends. &quot;Le Charivari&quot; gave him a new contract in 1864 and he resumed making caricatures for an appreciative audience in Paris. Daumier moved to Valmondois in 1865. He experienced failing eyesight and poverty there, although he continued to produce lithographs and paint, often on the theme of Don Quixote. The French Third Republic granted him a pension in 1877, and the following year a major exhibition of his paintings was held in Paris, which received significant recognition in the final months of his life. Daumier died in February 1879. Various sources give conflicting dates regarding the day of his death: some state February 10, 1879, others February 11.

==Life==
===Early life: 1808–1830===

Daumier was born in the south of France, in Marseille, to Jean-Baptiste Louis Daumier and Cécile Catherine Philippe. His father Jean-Baptiste was a glazier (corresponding nowadays to a framer), a poet and a minor playwright whose literary aspirations led him to move to Paris in 1814, followed by his wife and the young Daumier in 1816. Although Daumier&#x27;s father succeeded in publishing a book of verse and having an amateur troupe of actors perform his play in 1819, financial success was minimal and the family lived in poverty. At about the age of twelve (–21), Daumier started to work because of his father&#x27;s breakdown. His father found him a job working as an errand boy for a huissier de justice. Later he found employment at Delaunay&#x27;s, a well established bookstore at the Palais-Royal, a hub of Parisian life, where he began to meet artists, develop an interest in art, and started drawing. He spent much of his free time in the Louvre. In 1822 he became protégé to Alexandre Lenoir, a friend of Daumier&#x27;s father and the founder of the Musée des Monuments Francais (now Musée national des Monuments Français), who trained Daumier in the fundamentals of art. The following year he entered the Académie Suisse where he was able to draw from live models and develop friendships with other students including Philippe Auguste Jeanron and Auguste Raffet.

Lithography was a relatively new form of printmaking in the early 19th century, invented in Germany in the late 1790s. It was a fast and cheap method of mass-producing prints compared to the traditional practices of engraving and etching. Likewise, the art of the caricature, which was relatively established and popular in England (e.g. William Hogarth, Thomas Rowlandson), was just coming into vogue in France about this time. Lithography studios were emerging in Paris to fill demands for inexpensive illustrated papers and periodicals in a time of social and political upheaval. Daumier learned lithography from Charles Ramelet (1805–1851) and found work with Zéphirin Belliard (1798–1861), producing (often anonymously), miscellaneous illustrations, advertisements, street scenes, portraits, and caricatures in the mid to late 1820s, albeit honing his craft through the years.

===Career: 1830–1864===

After the &quot;Three Glorious Days&quot; of the July Revolution of 1830 (it is unknown if Daumier participated in actual street fighting), a number of new illustrated satirical journals emerged in Paris. These were left-wing publications, intended for the working classes. They were largely driven by the idea that the 1830 Revolution which brought Louis Philippe to power, was largely fought and won by the workers, but had been commandeered by the ruling class and bourgeoisie for their own gains and benefits, who in turn were favored by the king. Daumier&#x27;s first works of note appeared in &quot;La Silhouette&quot;, the first illustrated weekly satirical paper in France which ran from December 1829 to 2 January 1831. Daumier eagerly threw in his support and began to express his political convictions as a working class republican in opposition to the new monarchy, its bureaucracy, and the bourgeoisie that supported and profited from it. The editors of &quot;La Silhouette&quot; were prosecuted and jailed for a time during the short run of the paper. Charles Philipon and Gabriel Aubert, founded another satirical paper, &quot;La Caricature&quot; in 1830, starting up just as &quot;La Silhouette&quot; was folding under pressure from the monarchy. &quot;La Caricature&quot; invited Daumier to join its staff, a formidable group including Achille Devéria, Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard (J. J. Grandville), Auguste Raffet. and a young Honoré de Balzac as a literary editor, who is reported to have said of Daumier&#x27;s lithographs &quot;Why, this fellow&#x27;s got Michelangelo in his blood !&quot;

Daumier&#x27;s caricature of King Louis Philippe, titled &quot;Gargantua&quot;, was published in December 1831. He was brought to court in February 1832 and charged with &quot;inciting to hatred and contempt of the government and insulting the king&quot; and sentenced to six months imprisonment with a fine of 500 francs. However, his sentence was suspended at that time and Daumier returned to work where he continued to produce provocative and antagonistic lithographs for the papers. It was at this time he started work on his first sculptures, the &quot;Célébrités du Juste Milieu&quot; (1832–1835). Later that year, his cartoon &quot;The Court of King Pétaud&quot; (1832) was published and he was arrested at his parents apartment in August 1832 and placed in the prison of Sainte-Pélagie to serve his six months. Daumier remained defiant in prison and wrote a number of letters indicating that he was producing lots of drawings &quot;just to annoy the government.&quot; The publication of &quot;Gargantua&quot; and his imprisonment brought Daumier considerable notoriety, and great popularity among some segments of the public, but little financial gain. 

After his release from prison on February 14, 1833, Daumier, who had been living with his parents up that time, moved into an artist phalanstery on Rue Saint-Denis, where his friends included Narcisse Virgilio Díaz, Paul Huet, Philippe Auguste Jeanron, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Antoine-Augustin Préault. He resumed work at &quot;La Caricature&quot; and continued to publish critical and uncompromising lithographs including &quot;Rue Trensnonain&quot;, &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot;, and &quot;Past, Present, Future&quot; (all 1834) and spent long hours in the Louvre. The founder and editor of &quot;La Caricature&quot;, Charles Philipon, also endured a number of convictions and spent more time in prison than in his office during its run, as did many editors, authors, and illustrators of the opposition papers of the period. In 1834 &quot;La Caricature&quot; followed &quot;La Silhouette&quot; and collapsed after relentless prosecutions and fines from the monarchy. However, Philipon had already started another journal, &quot;Le Charivari&quot; in December 1832, which continued on with much the same content, and even many of the same staff members, including Daumier. On the fifth anniversary of the July Revolution (July 28, 1835), there was an unsuccessful assassination attempt on King Louis Philippe, the &quot;Fieschi attentat&quot;. A couple of months later the &quot;September Laws&quot; were passed, which imposed drastically higher fines and longer, oppressive prison sentences for publications criticizing the king and his regime. Under the new laws limiting the freedom of the press, criticisms and caricature of the monarchy had to be indirect, veiled, and oblique. Louis Philippe was often represented as a pear or with a pear for head. The tone and subjects of &quot;Le Charivari&quot; and Daumier&#x27;s lithographs began to change, turning away from direct political affronts, to lighter and humorous cartoons satirizing broader aspects of society, the bourgeoisie, at times scathingly, at other times affectionately. From 1835 to 1845 Daumier lived in the vicinity of Rue de l&#x27;Hirondelle and Ile de la Cite. Debt and financial issues were a recurring concern in his life. In one incident in April 1842 his furniture was auctioned off by order of the court to settle his debts.

On February 2, 1846, a seamstress named Alexandrine Dassy gave birth to Daumier&#x27;s illegitimate son, who was named Honoré Daumier. The couple were married on April 16, 1846. They moved to 9 Quai d&#x27;Anjou, on the Ile Saint-Louis in 1846 where they lived until 1863. One author described the Ile-Saint-Louis at that time as &quot;still a place apart, &#x27;a little provincial town&#x27; in the midst of Paris&quot;, where toll bridges discouraged casual traffic and artists could find freedom and inexpensive rent. Although Daumier had been doing some painting for a number of years, it was in the late 1840s that he became increasingly dedicated to painting. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1849, showing &quot;The Miller, his Son and the Ass&quot;. The painter Boissard de Boisdenier was a neighbor with an apartment in the Hôtel Lauzum (a.k.a. Hôtel Pinodan), which was a gathering place for writers, poets, painters, and sculptors where Daumier met many prominent artist of the day. It was there he made the acquaintance of Charles Baudelaire, who soon became a close friend and advocate of his work. Baudelaire contributed to a set of essays published in 1852 celebrating Daumier&#x27;s lithographs and prints calling him &quot;one of our leading men, not only in caricature, but in modern art.&quot; In time, Daumier gained the respect and was on friendly terms with artist such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Eugène Delacroix, Jean-François Millet, and Théodore Rousseau who, in contrast to the public, often admired Daumier&#x27;s paintings more than his lithographs. Delacroix thought enough of Daumier&#x27;s drawings to make copies of them to study.
The Revolutions of 1848 brought allied liberal, democratic leaders to power in France for a time. When a painting competition for an allegory of the new Republic was announced, Gustave Courbet abstained, and encouraged his friend Daumier to submit a piece. About one hundred artist submitted sketches and designs anonymously to a jury that included Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Eugène Delacroix, Paul Delaroche, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Philippe Auguste Jeanron, Alphonse de Lamartine, Ernest Meissonier, and Théophile Thoré-Bürger. Daumier presented an oil sketch, &quot;The Republic&quot; (now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay) that was very well received, and included among the 20 finalist. The finalist were expected to enlarge and articulate their submissions into more finalized designs. However Daumier, who was notorious for failing deadlines and poor punctuality, never followed through with an advanced painting. The following year, he received a commission for a painting from the Ministry of the Interior, via the Académie des Beau-Arts, requesting a sketch for approval, for a sum of 1,000 francs. Five months later the sum was raised to 1,500 francs. The Académie des Beau-Arts pursued the issue for 14 years, yet Daumier never produced a sketch or a painting, although he had accepted advances in payment. Ultimately he gave the government a gouache in 1863, &quot;The Drunkenness of Silenus&quot; (1849, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Calais), that had been exhibited in the solon of 1850.

Starting around 1853, he often spent summer months visiting Valmondois and Barbizon, where Corot, Daubigny, Millet, Rousseau, and others were painting, deepening his ties and friendships with the artist of the Barbizon School. By the mid to late 1850s Daumier had reached new levels of artistic maturity and increasingly wished to devote himself to painting. He was growing tired and weary of the grind and endless routine of producing new cartoons at a steady rate of two, three, sometimes as many as eight a week, yet he was dependent on the income. After 30 years of steadfast production, his caricatures were declining in popularity with the public, and in 1860 &quot;Le Charivari&quot; dropped him from their staff and ceased to publish his cartoons. While the next few years were a time of financial hardship and struggle, they were also years with free time to devote to painting, and a time of great productivity and artistic growth. An emerging market for Daumier’s highly finished watercolors depicting scenes of contemporary Parisian life provided him with some minimal income. Daumier exhibited regularly at the official Salon, although in this period of time it was only held once every two or three years. He suffered a serious illness in 1858. By 1863 Daumier was selling his furniture to raise funds and he left the Ile-Saint-Louis and moved to a succession of lodgings and apartments in Montmartre, losing contact with many friends and associates. &quot;Le Charivari&quot; presented him with a new contract in 1864 and he returned to making caricatures and cartoons for a living, and found a receptive audience when he did. By the mid 1860s, a few collectors were starting show some interest in his drawings and watercolors.

===Later years: 1865–1879===

Daumier spent the summer of 1865 in Valmondois, north of Paris with Théodore Rousseau, who was in declining health, and soon he left Montmartre permanently and rented a small cottage in Valmondois, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Although he had touched on the theme as early as 1850, he started working on &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in earnest about 1866 or 1867, painting many canvases on the subject over the next few years. He started experiencing failing eyesight around 1865 or 1866 which progressed with time, although he was still producing drawings and poster designs as late as 1872. He continued to exhibit at the Paris Salons for several years, although the canvases he submitted were often over ten years old. In 1864 he had made 100 lithographs and received 400 francs a month, but with very little time to paint. In 1866 he was producing 70 lithographs a year and earning 200 francs a month. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the newspapers stopped publishing and Daumier was signing promissory notes for his debts. His loyal friend, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, secretly bought the house Daumier had been renting in 1868 and bestowed it to him as a surprise, in a letter reading: &quot;Dear old comrade: I had a little house at Valnondois, near Isle-Adam, which was of no use to me. It occurred to me to offer it to you, and finding this was a good idea, I had it registered with the notary. It&#x27;s not for your sake I am doing this, but to annoy the landlord.&quot;

Although he was living a humble life away from Paris, in poverty and debt, and with failing eyesight, some belated recognition of his life&#x27;s work begin to appear in the last years and months of his life. The Second French Empire intended to award Daumier the Legion of Honor; however, he discreetly declined, feeling it was inconsistent with his political ideals and oeuvre. The French Third Republic again offered Daumier the Legion of Honor and again he declined, although he was later granted a pension of 200 francs a month (2,400 annually) in 1877, which was increased to 400 a month (4,800 annually) in 1878. A circle of his friends and admirers arranged a large exhibition of his paintings at the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris. Although the public had seen an occasional canvas in the salons, this was the first time the full scope and range of Daumier&#x27;s work was exhibited. It was not the financial success his friends had hoped for, but it was very well received by both the public and critics, and a decisive turning point in the perception of Daumier as an important painter. He died several months later, in February of 1879.

==Art==
===Paintings===

As a painter, Daumier was one of the pioneers of realistic subjects, which he treated with a point of view critical of class distinctions.
Although associated with the realist movement, he did not identify himself as realist or advocate the ideology of realism in the way Gustave Courbet and others did. The art historian Maurice Raynal commented on his relationship with realism &quot;this was not outcome of methods he deliberately chose or took from others. The truth is that realism was both a second nature with him and the consequence of the life he led, Actually, however, he never set up as an adept of realism, indeed it never occurred to him to apply the term to his art: still less to repudiate it&quot; At least one art historian, H. W. Janson placed him among the romantics, calling him &quot;the one great Romantic artist who did not shrink from reality&quot;, in contrast to the historic, literary, and the Near Eastern subjects that characterized much of romantic painting. Jean Leymarie wrote &quot;With the temperament of a Romantic and the approach of a Realist, Daumier belongs to the Barbizon generation, except that his domain was the human figure and not landscapes&quot;

Daumier&#x27;s paintings were radical for the time. One author stated &quot; The uncouthness that some connoisseurs of the time saw in Rembrandt&#x27;s painting, which was described as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;disgraceful,&quot; was accepted in his prints, which did not have the same function or the same public (just as for some people Daumier the lithographer excused the painter, while for others the painter ennobled the lithographer)&quot;.

Daumier would often set out with a new idea, painting the same subject repetitively, as many as 20 times, until he felt satisfied the theme was exhausted. Some of the subjects he repeatedly explored include: doctors, lawyers and the judicial system, theater and carnival subjects often in stage lighting (including actors, musicians, audiences, and backstage scenes), painters and sculpture in their studios, print and art collectors and connoisseurs, working people on the streets of Paris, the working class at leisure around a table (eating, drinking, playing chess), first and third class carriages, emigrants or refugees in flight, and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

His paintings did not meet with success until 1878, a year before his death. Except for the searching truthfulness of his vision and the powerful directness of his brushwork, it would be difficult to recognize the creator of &quot;Robert Macaire&quot;, of &quot;Les Bas bleus&quot;, &quot;Les Bohémiens de Paris&quot;, and the &quot;Masques&quot;, in the paintings of &quot;Christ and His Apostles&quot; (Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), or in his &quot;Good Samaritan&quot;, &quot;Don Quixote and Sancho Panza&quot;, &quot;Christ Mocked&quot;, or even in the sketches in the Ionides Collection at South Kensington.

===Sculptures===

Daumier was not only a prolific lithographer, draftsman and painter, but he also produced a notable number of sculptures in unbaked clay. In order to save these rare specimens from destruction, some of these busts were reproduced first in plaster. Bronze sculptures were posthumously produced from the plaster. The major 20th-century foundries were F. Barbedienne Barbedienne, , and .

Eventually Daumier produced between 36 busts of French members of Parliament in unbaked clay. The foundries involved from 1927 on to produce a bronze edition were Barbedienne in an edition of 25 &amp; 30 casts and Valsuani with three special casts based on the previous plaster castings from the gallery Sagot - Le Garrec clay collection. These bronze busts are all posthumous, based on the original, but frequently restored unbaked clay sculptures. The clay in its restored version can be seen at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

From the early 1950s on, some baked clay &#x27;Figurines&#x27; appeared, most of them belonging to the Gobin collection in Paris. It was Gobin who decided to have a bronze cast done by Valsuani in an edition of 30 each. Again, they were posthumous and there is no proof, in contrast to the busts mentioned above, that these terra cotta figurines really were done by Daumier himself. The American school (J.Wasserman from the Fogg-Harvard Museum) doubts their authenticity, while the French school, especially Gobin, Lecomte, and Le Garrec and Cherpin, all somehow involved in the marketing of the bronze editions, are sure of their Daumier origin. The Daumier Register (the international center of Daumier research) as well as the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC would consider the figurines as &#x27;in the manner of Daumier&#x27; or even &#x27;by an imitator of Daumier&#x27; (NGA)

Daumier created many figurines that he subsequently used as models for his paintings. One of Daumier&#x27;s most well-known figurines, titled &quot;The Heavy Burden&quot;, features a woman and her child. The woman is carrying something, possibly a large bag; the figurine is about 14 inches tall. Oliver W. Larkin states that &quot;One sees in the clay the mark of Daumier&#x27;s swift fingers as he nudged the skirt into windblown folds and used a knife blade or the end of a brush handle to define the clasped arms and the wrinkles of the cloth over the breast. In oil, he could only approximate this small masterpiece most successfully in two canvases were once owned by Arsene Alexandre.&quot;

Daumier made several paintings of &quot;The Heavy Burden&quot;. The woman and her child look like they are being pushed by the wind, and Daumier used this as a metaphor of the greater forces they were actually fighting against. The woman and her child in the painting are outlined by a very dark shadow.

Daumier produced his social caricatures for &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, in which he held bourgeois society up to ridicule in the figure of Robert Macaire, hero of a popular melodrama. In another series, &quot;L&#x27;histoire ancienne&quot;, he took aim at the constraining pseudo-classicism of the art of the period. In 1848 Daumier embarked again on his political campaign, still in the service of &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, which he left in 1863 and rejoined in 1864.

Around the mid-1840s, Daumier started publishing his famous caricatures depicting members of the legal profession, known as &#x27;Les Gens de Justice&#x27;, a scathing satire about judges, defendants, attorneys and corrupt, greedy lawyers in general. A number of extremely rare albums appeared on white paper, covering 39 different legal themes, of which 37 had previously been published in the Charivari. It has been said that Daumier&#x27;s own experience as an employee in a bailiff&#x27;s office during his youth may have influenced his rather negative attitude towards the legal profession.

In 1834 he produced the lithograph &quot;Rue Transnonain, 15 April 1834&quot; depicting the massacre in the Rue Transnonain which was part of the April 1834 riots in Paris. It was designed for the subscription publication &quot;L&#x27;Association Mensuelle&quot;. The profits were to promote freedom of the press and defrayed legal costs of a lawsuit against the satirical, politically progressive journal &quot;Le Charivari&quot; to which Daumier contributed regularly. The police discovered the print hanging in the window of printseller Ernest Jean Aubert in the Galerie Véro-Dodat (passageway in 1st arrondissement) and subsequently tracked down and confiscated as many of the prints they could find, along with the original lithographic stone on which the image was drawn. Existing prints of Rue Transnonain are survivors of this effort.

==Legacy==
Baudelaire noted of him: &quot;l&#x27;un des hommes les plus importants, je ne dirai pas seulement de la caricature, mais encore de l&#x27;art moderne.&quot; (&quot;One of the most important men, not only, I would say, in caricature, but also in modern art.&quot;) Vincent van Gogh was also a great admirer of his work. The first of many monographs on Daumier was published less than ten years after his death, by Arsène Alexander, &quot;Honoré Daumier, l&#x27;hommé et l&#x27;oeuvre&quot;, in 1888. An exhibition of his works was held at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1901. Daumier&#x27;s works are found in many of the world&#x27;s leading art museums, including the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Rijksmuseum. He is celebrated for a range of works, including a large number of paintings (500) and drawings (1000) some of them depicting the life of Don Quixote, a theme that fascinated him for the last part of his life.

A version of &quot;Don Quixote and Sancho Panza&quot; was found as part of the 2012 Munich Art Hoard.

Daumier&#x27;s 200th birthday was celebrated in 2008 with a number of exhibitions in Asia, America, Australia and Europe. There is a room-full of caricatures in the museum Am Römerholz in Winterthur.

<text>Debate is a process that involves formal discourse, discussion, and oral addresses on a particular topic or collection of topics, often with a moderator and an audience. In a debate, arguments are put forward for opposing viewpoints. Historically, debates have occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate halls, coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies. Debates have also been conducted for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies. These debates emphasize logical consistency, factual accuracy, and emotional appeal to an audience. Modern competitive debate also includes rules for participants to discuss and decide upon the framework of the debate (how it will be judged).

The term &quot;debate&quot; may also apply to a more continuous, inclusive, and less formalized process through which issues are explored and resolved across a range of agencies and among the general public. For example, the European Commission in 2021 published a &quot;Green Paper on Ageing&quot;, intended to generate such a debate on &quot;policies to address the challenges and opportunities of ageing&quot; in upcoming years. Pope Francis has also referred to the &quot;need for forthright and honest debate&quot; on society and the environment in his 2015 encyclical letter &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;.

== History ==

Debating in various forms has a long history that can be traced back to the philosophical and political debates of Ancient Greece, such as Athenian Democracy or the Shastrartha in Ancient India. 

In Imperial China&#x27;s Han Dynasty, debate amongst scholars was most famously portrayed in a series of debates known as the Discourses on Salt and Iron, held in 81 BCE. Named by Emperor Zhao for its two most famous debates, those debates focused on the reformation of the economic policies implemented by Zhao&#x27;s predecessor, Emperor Wu.

Modern forms of debating and the establishment of debating societies in the Western world occurred during the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century.

=== Emergence of debating societies ===

Trinity College Dublin boasts two of Europe&#x27;s oldest debating societies: The Hist in 1770, inspired by a debating club created by Edmund Burke in 1747, and The Phil, founded in 1683. The Society of Cogers was founded in London in 1755 and still operates today. Debating societies had emerged in London in the early 18th century, and soon became a prominent societal fixture of life in London. Although debating societies had existed in London since at least 1740, they were exclusive and secretive societies. However, by the mid-18th century, London fostered a vibrant debating society culture, largely due to increased membership from London&#x27;s growing middle class. The topics debated covered a broad spectrum, and debating societies allowed participants from all genders and social backgrounds, making them an example of the enlarged public sphere of the Age of Enlightenment. Debating societies were a phenomenon associated with the simultaneous rise of the public sphere. A sphere of discussion, separate from traditional authorities and accessible to all people, acted as a platform for criticism and the development of new ideas and philosophy.

John Henley, a clergyman, founded an Oratory in 1726 with the principal aim of &quot;reforming the manner in which public presentations should be performed&quot;. He extensively utilized the print industry to advertise the events of his Oratory, establishing it as a ubiquitous part of the London public sphere. Henley also played a crucial role in shaping the space of the debating club; he introduced two platforms to his room in the Newport district of London for the staging of debates and organized the entrances to facilitate the collection of admission fees. These modifications were further carried out when Henley relocated his enterprise to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. With the public now willing to pay for entertainment, Henley capitalized on the growing commercialization of British society. By the 1770s, debating societies had become a firmly established part of London society.

The year 1785 was pivotal: The &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; announced on March 26:

In 1780, 35 distinct societies advertised and hosted debates accommodating between 650 and 1200 individuals. The topic for debate was introduced by a president or moderator, who then moderated the discussion. Speakers were allotted specific time frames to present their arguments, and, following the debate, a vote was conducted to reach a conclusion or to adjourn the topic for further deliberation. Speakers were prohibited from slandering or insulting other speakers or straying from the designated topic, underscoring the premium placed on politeness by late 18th-century debaters.

=== Student debating societies ===

Princeton University in the future United States of America was home to several short-lived student debating societies throughout the mid-1700s. The American Whig Society at the university was co-founded in 1765 by future revolutionary James Madison.

The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies were formed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1795 and are still active. They are considered the first of the post-revolutionary debating societies.

The first student debating society in Great Britain was the St Andrews Debating Society, formed in 1794 as the &quot;Literary Society&quot;. The Cambridge Union Society was founded in 1815 and claims to be the oldest continually operating debating society in the World.

Over the next few decades, similar debate societies emerged at several other prominent universities, including the Oxford Union, the Yale Political Union, and the Conférence Olivaint.
== Political debate ==
=== Parliamentary debate ===
In parliaments and other legislatures, members debate proposals regarding legislation before voting on resolutions, which become laws. Debates are usually conducted by proposing a law, or changes to a law known as amendments. Parliamentary-style debates are structured with two opposing sides, the Leader of Opposition (LO) and the Government (GOV). After each side is allowed to speak once, members are permitted to give reply speeches to the opposing side&#x27;s points. Afterward, members of the parliament discuss the proposal before casting their votes for or against such a law. The first example of parliamentary debate took place in Liverpool in 1882.

Although Britain invented the system of parliamentary debate, it is not the only modern country to use a parliamentary system. Countries today that use a parliamentary system and parliamentary debate include Canada, Italy, Japan, Latvia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.

=== Participatory democracy ===

Participatory Democracy is a form of government in which citizens participate individually and directly in political decisions, which may be achieved through public debate.

In France, the procedure for public debate was defined in the Law of February 2, 1995 relating to the re-enforcement of the protection of the environment (commonly known as the Barnier Law, after the then minister for the environment).

=== Emergency debating ===
In some countries (e.g., Canada and the UK), members of parliament may request debates on urgent matters of national importance. According to Standing Order rules, an emergency debate may take precedence on Friday, or if the Speaker decides, at the next sitting within normal hours. The Speaker also determines when any other regular business, superseded by the emergency debate, is considered or discarded.

=== Debate between candidates for high office ===

In jurisdictions that elect holders of high political office, such as the President or Prime Minister, candidates sometimes debate in public, usually during a general election campaign.

==== U.S. presidential debates ====
Since the 1976 general election, debates between presidential candidates have been a part of U.S. presidential campaigns. Unlike debates sponsored at the high school or collegiate level, the participants and format are not independently defined. Nevertheless, in a campaign season heavily dominated by television advertisements, talk radio, sound bites, and spin, they still offer a rare opportunity for citizens to see and hear the major candidates side by side. The format of the presidential debates, though defined differently in every election, is typically more restrictive than many traditional formats, forbidding participants to ask each other questions and restricting discussion of particular topics to short time frames.

The presidential debates were initially moderated in 1976, 1980, and 1984 by the League of Women Voters, and the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) was established in 1987 by the Republican and Democratic parties. The presidential debate&#x27;s primary purpose is to sponsor and produce debates for the United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates in a nonpartisan environment. The organization, which is a nonprofit, nonpartisan corporation, sponsored all of the presidential debates in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

However, in announcing its withdrawal from sponsoring the debates, the League of Women Voters stated that it was withdrawing &quot;because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.&quot; In 2004, the Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission was formed in the hope of establishing an independent sponsor for presidential debates, with a more voter-centric role in the definition of the participants, format, and rules.

== Competitive debating styles ==

In competitive debates, teams compete against each other and are judged the winner by a list of criteria that is usually based around the concepts of &quot;content, style, and strategy&quot;. There are numerous styles of competitive debating, organizations, and rules, and competitive debates are held across the world at all levels.

Competitive debating is often most commonly found in secondary schools and institutions of higher education, especially in the United States, where competitive debating is often known as &quot;forensics&quot; or &quot;speech and debate&quot;. Many countries often also hold tournaments in competitive debates between different schools.

=== Australasia debating ===

The Australasian style of debate consists of two teams of three people, debating a topic. The topic is presented in the form of an affirmative statement beginning with &quot;That&quot; or &quot;This House&quot;, for example, &quot;That cats are better than dogs&quot;, or &quot;This House should raise taxes&quot;. Most topics are usually specific to local Australian regions to facilitate participant and audience interest.

Each of the six speakers (three affirmative and three negative) speak in succession to each other, beginning with the Affirmative Team. The speaking order is as follows: First Affirmative, First Negative, Second Affirmative, Second Negative, Third Affirmative, and finally Third Negative. The debate is finished with a closing argument by the last speaker from each team. &quot;Points of Information&quot; (an interrupting question or statement), more commonly known as &quot;POIs&quot;, are used in Australian and New Zealand Secondary School level debating.

The context in which the Australasia style of debate is used varies, but in Australia and New Zealand, it is mostly used at the Primary and Secondary school level.

=== European square debating ===
European square debating has a Paris-style inspired format with four teams. France, the United Kingdom, and Germany are always represented, in addition to one other major European nation (for example, Russia). These &quot;Nations&quot; then confront each other in a policy debate on European issues, as parts of two broad coalitions. Each team is composed of two speakers (the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary). The debate starts with the first speaker from France, followed by the first speaker of Germany (the opposite side), followed by the second speaker of France, and the second speaker of Germany. The debate continues with the first speaker of the United Kingdom, followed by the first speaker of Russia, and it goes on with the respective second speakers. Each debater speaks for 5 minutes. The first and the last minutes are protected time: no Points of Information may be asked. During the rest of the speech, the speaker may be interrupted by Points of Information (POIs) from the opposite countries (debaters from France and the UK may ask POIs from debaters representing Germany and Russia, and vice versa, respectively). The format forces each debater to develop a winning strategy while respecting the coalition. This format was commonly developed by the Franco-British Comparative Project and Declan McCavanna, Chairman of the FDA and featured France, the UK, Germany, Russia and Italy.

=== Impromptu debating ===

Impromptu debating is a relatively informal style of debating when compared to other highly structured formats of debate. The topic for the debate is given to the participants between fifteen and twenty minutes before the debate starts. The debate format is relatively simple; each team member of each side speaks for five minutes, alternating sides. A ten-minute discussion period, similar to other formats&#x27; &quot;open cross-examination&quot; time follows, and then a five-minute break (comparable to other formats&#x27; preparation time). Following the break, each team gives a 4-minute rebuttal.

Impromptu debate is often considered to be more akin to Public Speaking since speeches can be anywhere between stand-up routines, to the reputations of nations, depending on the topic given to the contestants. Contestants will be given a list of abstract topics when the event begins and will create a speech on their chosen topic.
=== Lincoln–Douglas debating ===
Lincoln-Douglas debating is primarily a form of United States high school debate (though there is a collegiate Lincoln-Douglas debate) and is named after the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates. It is a one-on-one event that applies philosophical theories to real-world issues. The debaters normally alternate sides from round to round as either the &quot;affirmative&quot;, which upholds the resolution, or the &quot;negative&quot;, which attacks it. The resolution, which changes bimonthly, generally asks whether a certain policy or action conforms to a specific value. National Forensic Association Lincoln-Douglas debate (NFA-LD), the collegiate Lincoln-Douglas debate, uses one resolution per academic year, and is a one-on-one form of policy debate.

Though established as an alternative to policy debate, there has been a strong movement to embrace certain techniques that originated in policy debate. Traditional LD debate attempts to be free of policy debate &quot;jargon&quot;. Lincoln-Douglas speeches can range in speed from a conversational pace to well over 300 words per minute. This technique of fast-talking is often called spreading and is also prevalent in policy debates.

=== Mace debating ===
The Mace debating style is prominent in Britain and Ireland at the school level and is composed of two teams of two people, debating a motion, which one team will propose, and the other will oppose.
Each speaker will make a seven-minute speech in the order; 1st Proposition, 1st Opposition, 2nd Proposition, 2nd Opposition. After the first minute of each speech, members of the opposing team may request a &#x27;point of information&#x27; (POI). If the speaker accepts, they are permitted to ask a question. POIs are used to attack a speaker on a weak point or to argue against something the speaker said. After all four debaters have spoken, the debate will be opened to the floor, in which members of the audience will question the teams. Finally, one speaker from each team will speak for 4 minutes. In these summary speeches, the speaker will answer the questions posed by the floor and opposition, before summarizing their key points. The Mace format of the debate is designed to be beginner-friendly and to prepare students for British Parliamentary style debate (which it is modeled on).

=== Mock trial ===
=== Model United Nations ===
=== Moot court ===
=== Oxford-style debating ===
Derived from the Oxford Union debating society of Oxford University, Oxford-style debating is a competitive debate format featuring a sharply assigned motion that is proposed by one side and opposed by another. Oxford-style debates follow a formal structure that begins with audience members casting a pre-debate vote on the motion that is either for, against, or undecided. Each panelist presents a seven-minute opening statement, after which the moderator takes questions from the audience with inter-panel challenges. Finally, each panelist delivers a two-minute closing argument, and the audience delivers their second (and final) vote for comparison against the first. A winner is then declared either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes.

=== Paris-style debating ===
In Paris debating, two teams of five debate a given motion. One team will attempt to defend the motion while the other team will attack the motion. The debate is judged on the quality of the arguments, the strength of the rhetoric, the charisma of the speaker, the quality of the humor, the ability to think on one&#x27;s feet, and teamwork. Despite this format being specifically used in France debates are commonly held in English.

The first speaker of the Proposition (Prime Minister) opens the debate, followed by the first speaker of the Opposition (Shadow Prime Minister), then the second speaker of the Proposition, and so on.

Every speaker speaks for 6 minutes. After the first minute and before the last minute, debaters from the opposite team may ask for Points of Information, which the speaker may accept or reject as he wishes (although they are supposed to accept at least two).

The French Debating Association organizes its National Debating Championship in this style.

=== Parliamentary style debating ===

Parliamentary debate is conducted under rules originally derived from British parliamentary procedure, though parliamentary debate now has several variations, including American, Brazilian, British, Canadian, and German forms. It features the competition of individuals in a multi-person setting. It borrows terms such as &quot;government&quot; and &quot;opposition&quot; from the British parliament (although the term &quot;proposition&quot; is sometimes used rather than &quot;government&quot; when debating in the United Kingdom).

Parliamentary debate is practiced worldwide and many international variations have been created. The premier event in the world of parliamentary debate is the World Universities Debating Championship. This tournament is conducted in the traditional British Parliamentary style of debate.

=== Policy debating ===
&quot;Policy debate&quot; is a fast-paced form of debate mostly commonly practiced in the U.S. Policy debate is composed of two teams of two that will advocate for and against a resolution (typically a proposed policy for the United States federal government or an international organization). Affirmative teams generally present a proposal to implement a specific modified form of the resolution called a plan. The negative will either try to disprove or undermine this plan or display that the opportunity costs of their opponent&#x27;s plan are so great that it should not be implemented. Policy Debate is sometimes also referred to as cross-examination debate (shortened to CX) because of the 3-minute questioning periods following each constructive speech.

=== Public debating ===

Public debate may mean simply debating by the public, or in public. The term is also used for a particular formal style of debate in a competitive or educational context. Two teams of two compete through six rounds of argument, giving persuasive speeches on a particular topic.

=== Public forum debating ===

&quot;Public forum&quot; debating combines aspects of both policy debate and Lincoln-Douglas debate but makes them easily understood by the general public by having shorter speech lengths, an absence of jargon, and longer questioning periods, called &quot;cross-fires,&quot; where the debaters interact. This form of debate is also designed to address current affairs, with topics that change monthly and address both U.S. policy and international issues. This form of debate is primarily found within the United States. The core basis of this type of debate is that anyone is eligible to become a judge for the debate, unlike the Policy debate or Lincoln-Douglas debate, which requires more experience in debate to judge.

=== Tibetan Buddhist debating ===
This is a traditional Buddhist form of debating that was influenced by earlier Indian forms. Largely developed in Tibet, this style includes two individuals, one functioning as the Challenger (questioner) and the other as the Defender (answerer). The debaters must depend on their memorization of the points of doctrine, definitions, illustrations, and even whole text, together with their measure of understanding gained from instruction and study.

Characteristics that uniquely define the Tibetan Buddhist style of debating are ceremonial recitation and symbolic movements and hand gestures by debaters. At the opening of a debate, the standing Challenger claps his hands together and invokes Manjushri, who is the manifestation of the wisdom of all the Buddhas and, as such, is the special deity of debate.

When the Challenger first puts their question to the sitting Defender, their right hand is held above the shoulder at the level of their head, and the left hand is stretched forward with the palm turned upward. At the end of their statement, the Challenger punctuates by loudly clapping together their hands and simultaneously stomping their left foot. They then stylistically drawback their right hand slowly with the palm held upward and, at the same time, hold forth their left hand with the palm turned downward. Holding forth the left hand after clapping symbolizes closing the door to rebirth in samsara. The drawing back and raising of the right hand symbolizes one&#x27;s will to raise all sentient beings out of samsara, and cyclic existence, and to establish them in the omniscience of Buddhahood. The left hand represents &quot;Wisdom&quot; – the &quot;antidote&quot; to cyclic existence, and the right hand represents &quot;Method&quot; – the altruistic intention to become enlightened for the benefit of all. The clap represents a union of Method and Wisdom.

=== Turncoat debating ===

In this debating style, the same speaker shifts allegiance between &quot;For&quot; and &quot;Against&quot; the motion. It is a solo contest, unlike other debating forms. Here, the speaker is required to speak for 2 minutes &quot;For the motion&quot;, two minutes &quot;Against the motion&quot;, and finally draw up a 1-minute conclusion in which the speaker balances the debate. At the end of the fifth minute, the debate will be opened to the house, in which members of the audience will put questions to the candidate, which they will have to answer. In the Turncoat format, the emphasis is on transitions, the strength of argument, and the balancing of opinions.

== International groups and events ==

=== Asian Universities Debating Championship ===

United Asian Debating Championship is the biggest university debating tournament in Asia, where teams from the Middle East to Japan come to debate. It is traditionally hosted in Southeast Asia, where participation is usually highest compared to other parts of Asia.

Asian debates are largely an adaptation of the Australasian format. The only difference is that each speaker is given 7 minutes of speech time, and there will be points of information (POI) offered by the opposing team between the 2nd to 6th minutes of the speech. This means that the 1st and 7th minute is considered the &#x27;protected&#x27; period where no POIs can be offered to the speaker.

The debate will commence with the Prime Minister&#x27;s speech (first proposition) and will be continued by the first opposition. This alternating speech will go on until the third opposition. Following this, the opposition bench will give the reply speech. In the reply speech, the opposition goes first and then the proposition. The debate ends when the proposition ends the reply speech. 4 minutes are allocated for the reply speech, and no POIs can be offered during this time.

=== Online debating ===

With the increasing popularity and availability of the Internet, differing opinions arise frequently. Though they are often expressed via flaming and other forms of argumentation, which consist primarily of assertions, formalized debating websites do exist. The debate style varies from site to site, with local communities and cultures developing. Some sites promote a contentious atmosphere that can border on &quot;flaming&quot; (the personal insult of your opponent, also known as a type of ad hominem fallacy), while others strictly admonish such activities and strongly promote independent research and better arguments.

debatewise.org, debateart.com and debate.club are known as debate portals. Rulesets on various sites usually serve to enforce or create a good culture with the site&#x27;s owner, or in some more open communities, the community itself. Managing post content, style, and access combined with frequent use of &quot;reward&quot; systems (such as reputation, titles, and forum permissions) to promote activities seen as productive while discouraging unwelcome actions. Those cultures vary sufficiently that most styles can find a forum. Some online debate communities and forums practice Policy Debate through uploaded speeches and preset word counts to represent time limits present in the offline debate. Those online debates typically feature long periods of theoretical prep time, as well as the ability to research during a round or to step away from attending online.

=== Debate shows ===

Debates have also been made into a television show genre.

<doc id="337691" wikidata="Q1832627" url="?curid=337691" title="Vintage car">
<text>A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930, Either a &quot;survivor&quot; or one that has been fixed up according to the original manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK.

== History ==
The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s. In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design.

Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this period. Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix), as was the in-car radio. Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.

===United States perspective===
Towards the end of the vintage era, the system of octane rating of fuel was introduced, allowing comparison between fuels. In 1923 the gasoline additive tetraethyl lead made its debut at the Indy 500 that resulted in a boost in octane from the 1950s to the 1980s In the United States drive-in restaurants were introduced as well as suburban shopping centers and motels.

Alfred P. Sloan and Harley Earl of General Motors, and Walter P. Chrysler capitalized on advertising the automobile&#x27;s role in the life of the consumer for more than just the utilitarian value compared with the horse. The stock market crash of 1929 started the layoff of automotive workers and many new companies went bankrupt but over two million cars were still produced in 1929 and 1930.

=== United States Federal road and highway acts ===
The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 was the first federal highway act. War and lack of funding hampered any positive results of this act. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act) started a 50/50 matching fund to states for road building and resulted in the creation of new and improved roads. During this period as well as the car adapting to society, there were better roads, and society began to adapt to the car. Dwight D. Eisenhower participated in the highly publicized Transcontinental Motor Convoy in 1919 and after becoming President the experience influenced the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 that included 41,000 miles of highways.

==== Depression of 1920–1921 ====
The end of World War I brought about the &quot;Depression of 1920–1921&quot; with an inflation rate of over 20 percent, a 7 percent Federal Bank discount loan rate, and an 11.7 percent unemployment rate, that resulted in many companies going bankrupt and the automotive industry was decimated.

==== Industry rationalization ====
From 1919 to 1929, many dramatic changes took place. General Motors went into a financial crisis that lasted until after Alfred Sloan became president in 1923. Hudson produced the Essex in 1919 that, by 1925, had propelled the company to third in total sales behind Ford and Chevrolet. Ford was in the process of building a new plant, buying back stock, and began an 18-month process of tooling-up to replace the Model T with the Model A in 1927. In 1921 Maxwell failed and Walter P. Chrysler, formerly of General Motors, was brought in to reorganize it and, in 1925, the Chrysler Corporation was formed. With Ford out for a period, Chrysler was able to produce and market the low-priced Plymouth in 1928, and bought out the Dodge Brothers, also in 1928, resulting in &quot;The Big Three&quot; in the United States.

There were other automakers that made it past the 1920-1921 depression only to fail during the Great Depression.

=== Europe === 
During the Great Depression, in Britain many small companies started in the post World War I boom failed or merged leaving six major manufacturers: Morris, Austin, Standard, Singer, Ford of Britain, and General Motors Vauxhall. A similar boom-and-bust cycle was seen in mainland Europe.

== Safety issues ==
Antique automobiles and early to middle era classic cars do not have the safety features that are standard on modern cars. The most rudimentary of safety features, front wheel brakes and hydraulic brakes, began appearing on cars in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.

== Collecting ==
For the average person car collecting is a hobby. A person can have a fascination with a certain vehicle, make or a history with one so seeks a particular make or model. Finding such a car at an affordable price is not always hard but the price will depend on the condition or the desired end result. Usually the less work required on a vehicle equates to a higher price, the more work required means a cheaper initial cost, but often more in the long run, and a person&#x27;s level of restoration experience plays an important part.

=== Investment ===
Comedian and avid car collector Jay Leno stated, &quot;Any car can be a collector car, if you collect it.&quot; Car collecting as an investment can be rewarding but most serious investment collectors seek rare or exotic cars and original unmodified cars hold a more stable price. Collecting as an investment requires expertise beyond enthusiast collecting and the standard of quality is far higher as well as a need for investment protection such as storage and maintenance. A short-term investment collector must be able to find a vehicle that has market value that is expected to rise in the foreseeable near future. A long-term investment collector would be less interested in any short-term value seeking to capitalize on an expected value rise over a period of years and a vehicle must have certain intrinsic values that are common to other investors or collectors of both short and long term.

=== Rarity ===
Cars that were made in small numbers or often have a higher value but can be more difficult to maintain. Certain year and model cars became popular to turn into hot rods thus destroying their original condition. Other models were produced in such quantities that the price is still not inflated. Market trend is an important part in the price of a vintage car. An &quot;almost&quot; original and in perfect shape model A that was abundantly produced can be purchased for $20,000.00. A collector as an investor would have to know the potential market and have a belief that the future market will bring a return on an investment.

=== Valuation ===
Determining the value of a vintage car can be difficult, as there are many different factors that can potentially influence the price. The age, condition, rarity, modifications, vehicle history and mileage can all drastically change a car&#x27;s value, among other observable factors such as body type, drivetrain and engine capacity. In recent years, services have begun providing classic and vintage car valuation data to the public, by establishing baseline prices for vehicles in various conditions and publishing marketing trends and forecasts collectors can use to monitor the state of the market. As a result of the variability in car values, most insurers offer Agreed Value insurance coverage for classic cars. Agreed Value coverage involves both the owner and insurance company agreeing on the car&#x27;s value and insuring it for the agreed amount. This differs from the Actual Cash Value claim settlement method used in traditional auto insurance policies, which determines the claim value of the vehicle after a &quot;total loss&quot; or vehicle theft occurs.

=== Condition categories ===
To collectors and investors, a vehicle&#x27;s condition rating is important, and in the United States there are two systems, the category and the points system. The category system has six categories used to rate the condition of a vehicle. The points system assigns points from 40 to 100 that correspond with the category system and below 40 there are three for other conditions. Both systems are listed together for ease of comparison:
*Category I, Perfect; 90 to 100 points. A vehicle is considered as good or better than the day produced.
*Category II, Excellent; 80 to 89 points. A vehicle in excellent original or superior restored, near-flawless condition.
*Category III, Fine; 70 to 79 points. A vehicle with an older restoration or an original car with minimal wear. These are considered &quot;show quality&quot;.
*Category IV, Very good; 60 to 69 points. A vehicle that is in complete original condition, or possibly an older restoration, that is usually a well-cared-for daily driver.
*Category V, Good; 50 to 59 points. A vehicle that shows wear, needs attention or work, and needs only minor restoration, with no major flaws. Points from 40 to 59 fall into this category.
*Category VI, Driver; 40 to 49 points.

==== Other categories ====
*Restorable; 30 to 39 points. This vehicle would be in need of restoration of the motor, body, interior and/or chassis. A car in this class should be more or less complete, needing some parts but requiring a tremendous amount of work to get to show quality.
*Partial; 20 to 29 points. This vehicle would require extensive restoration with a significant number of parts and amount of labor—a very time-consuming and costly prospect.
*Parts car; 10 to 19 points. This would generally be an inoperative vehicle in poor condition, kept as a source or &#x27;donor&#x27; of spare parts. With the exception of very rare vehicles, complete restoration of this category is usually not feasible.

=== Collectors Plates/ Antique Vehicle Registry ===
If a car is older than a certain age, a vintage car can be approved for an antique vehicle registration.

<text>Marek Kotański (March 11, 1942 – August 19, 2002) was a Polish charity worker and campaigner on behalf of disadvantaged people, including the homeless and those with HIV. He died in a car accident in Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, near Warsaw.
==Life==
Kotański was a psychologist and a psychotherapist - he organized many projects to fight against social problems and helped alcoholics, drug addicts, people with HIV, ex-prisoners and homeless people. Among the organisations he created are Monar and Markot.

Born in Warsaw during the Second World War, Marek Kotański&#x27;s mother, Ludwika, was a painter. His father, Wiesław, was a Japanese language professor at Warsaw University. His house was open for everyone who needed help.

Already in high school Kotański launched initiatives to help people in need. From 1960 he studied psychology at Warsaw University. During his studies, he was active in the Ruch Młodych Wychowawców (Movement of Young Educators) who looked after orphans and young people affected by social problems. After his studies, he worked as a therapist in the psychiatric hospital on Dolna Street in Warsaw. He cooperated with the Społeczny Komitet Przeciwdziałania Alkoholizmowi (Social Anti-Alcoholism Committee), and also was active in the Ruch Trzeźwość (Abstinence Movement).

In 1974 Kotański was employed in the Psychiatric Hospital in Garwolin, which had a section for drug addicts (even though during that period, for ideological reasons, drug addicts did not exist). Knowing that traditional methods were not effective, he started a therapy group. This sort of therapy group came to be known as &quot;społeczność&quot; (community). He also started the healing system for drug addicts known as &quot;Monar&quot;.

The first Monar centre was opened on 15 October 1978 in Gloskow near Garwolin, starting in part of an abandoned house in ruins. Kotański started this program with a group or patients from the hospital in Garwolin. The results were better than expected. Now there are more than 157 Monar centres.

He also organised settlements for people with HIV or ill with AIDS, starting another association Solidarni Plus (Solidarity Plus).

From 1985 to 1994 Kotański organised the action &quot;Łańcuch Czystych Serc&quot; (Chain of Pure Hearts), where hundreds of thousands of young people joined hands in a chain stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Tatra mountains, symbolising unity for humanitarianism. He also organised many &quot;Czystych Serc&quot; concerts where thousands of people participated.

In 1993 Kotański created Markot - Ruch Wychodzenia z Bezdomności (Movement Out of Homelessness), which involves about one hundred centres for homeless people, lone mothers with children, handicapped people, and the terminally ill.

He also developed a help system for people coming out of prison, starting from 1994, without any financial help.

Kotański received many prizes, including:
*the Victor prize (received twice)
*the Brother Albert prize (nagroda imienia Brata Alberta)
*Order Uśmiechu (Order of the Smile) in the year 2000

<text>Ace of Wands is a British fantasy children&#x27;s television show broadcast on ITV between 1970 and 1972.

In the first two series, Tarot is assisted by Sam Maxstead, a reformed convict, and by the orphan Lillian &quot;Lulli&quot; Palmer.

She also shared a telepathic link with Tarot. A character named Mr Sweet who runs an antiquarian bookshop often has the answer to Tarot&#x27;s questions. Sweet is based in a university for the last series.

<doc id="337711" wikidata="Q6056793" url="?curid=337711" title="Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association">
<text>Organized in 1951 as the Interstate and Foreign Missionary Baptist Associational Assembly of America, this group is now known as the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association of America. Their purpose is to encourage fellowship among Missionary Baptist churches that practice ministerial support by freewill offerings. Since they do not believe in stipulated salaries for pastors and missionaries, they are also known as &quot;Faithway Baptists&quot;.

Churches of this association originally fellowshipped with the American Baptist Association. A split in the &quot;American Baptist Association&quot; (organized 1924) resulted in the formation of two new national associations - the Baptist Missionary Association of America (then called &quot;North American Baptist Association&quot;) and the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association. All three of these associations adhere to the Landmark principle of a succession of Baptist churches from the time of Christ to the present.

Doctrinally, the churches of the &quot;Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association&quot; hold that Christ died for all men; salvation is by grace through faith; the saved are eternally secure; the church is local only and was organized by Christ while He was on earth; baptism by immersion and the Lord&#x27;s supper are church ordinances; foot washing is to be performed in church capacity; ministerial support must be by freewill offerings; and the Great Commission is given to local churches only.

The association work consists of local churches recommending their missionaries to other churches. All decisions to support missionaries are made by the churches in their own business meetings. Local churches sponsor and directly support all missionary, benevolent, and educational work.

In 1951, forty churches were represented at the organization. In 2000, there were 135 churches in the association, with a membership of 14,945. Some fellowshipping churches represent in local and state associations but not in the general association. The total number of Faithway Baptist churches meeting in associations is 168 with over 30,000 members. Most of the churches are concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; but affiliated churches also are present outside the United States in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Quebec, Canada, and South Korea. Twelve foreign, six interstate, and two radio missionaries were recommended by their churches (2000). A paper, &quot;The Voice of Faith&quot;, is published by the Pine Missionary Baptist Church, Franklinton, Louisiana. &quot;Faith Way Sunday School Literature&quot; is printed by Palestine Missionary Baptist Church of Wilmer, Alabama.

<text>Gisèle Lestrange or Gisèle de Lestrange, and after marriage, Gisèle Celan-Lestrange (19 March 1927 – 9 December 1991), was a French graphic artist.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, Lestrange studied drawing and painting at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1945 to 1949, and then etching at the Atelier Friedlaender, in Paris, from 1954 to 1957. She became a well-known engraver, working for the Atelier Lacourière-Frélaut in Paris as of 1964. Her father, a known supporter of the Vichy regime, died in 1943.

On 21 December 1952 she married the poet Paul Celan, whom she had met in November 1951. The couple had two sons, Francois (b. 1953), who died immediately after birth, and Eric (b. 1955). As of 1967, however, she and Celan lived in separate homes. As a graphic artist, she illustrated the works of a number of well-known poets. Many of her works are linked to Celan&#x27;s poems. She died in Paris, and was buried in the same grave as her husband, at Cimetière parisien de Thiais.

<text>In computer science, a composite data type or compound data type is a data type that consists of programming language scalar data types and other composite types that may be heterogeneous and hierarchical in nature. It is sometimes called a structure or a record or by a language-specific keyword used to define one such as struct. It falls into the aggregate type classification which includes homogenous collections such as the array and list.

<doc id="337723" wikidata="Q1126131" url="?curid=337723" title="Kronos Quartet">
<text>The Kronos Quartet is an American string quartet based in San Francisco. It has been in existence with a rotating membership of musicians for 50 years. The quartet covers a very broad range of musical genres, including contemporary classical music. More than 1,000 works have been written for it. The quartet has recorded over 40 albums and received a number of awards.

==History==
The quartet was founded by violinist David Harrington in Seattle, Washington. Its first performance was in November 1973. Since 1978, the quartet has been based in San Francisco, California. The longest-running combination of performers (from 1978 to 1999) had Harrington and John Sherba on violin, Hank Dutt on viola, and Joan Jeanrenaud on cello. In 1999, Jeanrenaud left Kronos because she was &quot;eager for something new&quot;; she was replaced by Jennifer Culp, who, in turn, left in 2005 and was replaced by Jeffrey Zeigler. In June 2013, Zeigler was replaced by Sunny Yang. In February 2023, cellist and composer Paul Wiancko became the quartet&#x27;s newest cellist. In March 2024, Kronos Quartet announced that Sherba and Dutt will retire in June of that year, being replaced by violinist Gabriela Díaz and violist Ayane Kosaza.

With over 40 studio albums to its credit and having performed worldwide, the Kronos Quartet has been called &quot;probably the most famous &#x27;new music&#x27; group in the world&quot; and been praised in philosophical studies of music for the inclusiveness of its repertoire.

By the time the quartet celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1999, it had a repertoire of over 600 works, including 400 quartets written for it, more than 3,000 performances, seven first-prize ASCAP awards, Edison Awards in classical and popular music, and had more than 1.5 million record sales.

===30th anniversary===
When Kronos turned 30, in 2003, it decided to commission new pieces from composers under age 30, in hopes of encouraging talented young composers. The program, called the Under 30 Project, is now run in cooperation with Carnegie Hall, Cal Performances at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Montalvo Arts Center. The first recipient was Alexandra du Bois (at the time a student at Indiana University, later a Juilliard School graduate), followed by Felipe Perez Santiago (born in Mexico in 1973), and Dan Visconti (born in Illinois in 1982); in 2007, Israeli composer Aviya Kopelman became the fourth.

===40th anniversary===
To celebrate its 40th year, the Kronos Quartet returned to Seattle, the city in which it first played, and worked in collaboration with Seattle&#x27;s Degenerate Art Ensemble to create a piece incorporating music, dance and video. It celebrated its 40th anniversary with a sold-out performance at Zellerbach Hall, UC Berkeley, in December 2013. The same year, Michael Giacchino, a soundtrack composer who often names his pieces with puns, published a piece named after Kronos, &quot;The Kronos Wartet&quot;, as a part of the soundtrack to &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; for a scene that takes place on the fictional planet &quot;Kronos&quot;. (also spelled &quot;Qo&#x27;noS&quot;).

==Members==
==New music, contemporary classical==

Over 1,000 pieces have been created for the Kronos Quartet, which has a long history of commissioning new works. It has worked with many minimalist composers, including John Adams, Arvo Pärt, George Crumb, Henryk Górecki, Steve Reich, John Luther Adams, Roberto Paci Dalò, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, Peter Sculthorpe and Kevin Volans; collaborators hail from a diversity of countries—Kaija Saariaho from Finland, Pēteris Vasks from Latvia, Franghiz Ali-Zadeh from Azerbaijan, from Afghanistan, Hamza El Din from Egypt, Victoria Vita Polevá from Ukraine and Fernando Otero, Astor Piazzolla, and Osvaldo Golijov from Argentina. Some of Kronos&#x27;s string-quartet arrangements were published in 2007.

==Diverse genres==

Kronos covers a very broad range of musical genres: Mexican folk, experimental, pre-classical early music, movie soundtracks (&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;The Fountain&quot;), jazz and tango. Kronos has also recorded adaptations of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, Sigur Rós&#x27;s &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot;, Television&#x27;s &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, Raymond Scott&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals&quot;, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;.

Kronos has also worked with a variety of global musicians, including Bollywood playback singer Asha Bhosle; Mexican-American painter Gronk; American soprano Dawn Upshaw; jazz composer/performer Pat Metheny; Mexican rockers Café Tacuba; Azerbaijani mugam singer Alim Qasimov; and the Romanian gypsy band Taraf de Haïdouks among others.

Kronos has performed live with the poet Allen Ginsberg, Astor Piazzolla, The National, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Tom Waits, David Bowie, Paul McCartney and Björk, and has recorded with Nelly Furtado, Rokia Traoré, Joan Armatrading, Brazilian electronica artist Amon Tobin, Texas yodeler Don Walser, Faith No More, Tiger Lillies and David Grisman.

In 1984, Frank Zappa wrote &quot;None of the Above&quot; for Kronos, of which it performs the first movement in the 2020 documentary &quot;Zappa&quot;, directed by Alex Winter. Kronos&#x27;s artistic director, founder, and violinist David Harrington is also interviewed in the film.

On the 1998 Dave Matthews Band album &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, Kronos Quartet performed on the tracks &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;The Stone&quot;. It also recorded for the 2007 Nine Inch Nails remix album, &quot;Year Zero Remixed&quot; doing a rendition of the track &quot;Another Version of the Truth&quot;&quot;. The group performed Lee Brooks&#x27;s score for the short film &quot;2081&quot;, based on the Kurt Vonnegut short story &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;.

In 2009, Kronos contributed an acoustic version of Blind Willie Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In 2017, the quartet performed as featured artists on the songs &quot;Lost Light&quot; and &quot;Journey&quot; on the soundtrack to the videogame &quot;Destiny 2&quot;.

<text>The Cache River National Wildlife Refuge is a 68,993 acre (223 km2) (2014) wildlife refuge in the state of Arkansas managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge is one of the Ramsar wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention signed in 1971. It is one of the most important wintering area for ducks and the largest remaining tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest on the North American continent. In 2005, a possible sighting of the ivory-billed woodpecker, thought to be extinct, brought attention to the refuge.

In 2012, the FWS proposed the gradual expansion of the refuge up to a maximum of .

==History and description==

In the 1970s, duck hunters prevented the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from dredging and straightening the Cache River. The conservation movement led to the establishment of the National Wildlife Refuge in 1986. The nearby town of Stuttgart, Arkansas calls itself the &quot;Rice and Duck Capital of the World.&quot; The National Wildlife Refuge runs along the flood-plain of the Cache River for 70 miles (100 km) from the Cache River&#x27;s mouth at Clarendon, Arkansas to the town of Grubbs, Arkansas. The refuge encompasses land in the Arkansas counties of Jackson, Woodruff, Prairie, and Monroe.

The Cache River NWR has gradually expanded to its present size through acquisition from private owners of land. Most of the land in the refuge, and that planned for acquisition, had been drained and used for agriculture. The long-term goal is to re-forest former farming areas with native vegetation along the meandering sloughs, oxbow lakes, swamps, and bald cypress forests of the Cache River and Bayou De View. The Cache River NWR already preserves the largest tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States.
The refuge currently includes 47,000 acres (134 km2) of bottomland forest and sloughs. It also includes several oxbow lakes and 17,000 acres (30 km2) of formerly agricultural land now in the process of reforestation. The refuge is home to over 50 species of mammals including deer, raccoon, bobcat, and river otter. It also is home for nearly 240 species of birds including ducks, geese, wading birds, and other assorted migratory birds. The swampy bottomlands are also home to 48 species of reptiles and amphibians.

The Cache River refuge is the most important wintering area for mallard ducks in North America and also important for other duck and neo-tropic species. It hosts the only native black bear population in Arkansas.

Other similar protected areas for wildlife located nearby along the Cache and White Rivers include the Bald Knob, Big Lake, and Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuges. Other conservation lands such as several state owned wildlife management areas are also nearby. The White River National Wildlife Refuge borders the Cache River Refuge on the south.

==Ivory-billed woodpecker==

On April 29, 2005, a team from Cornell Lab of Ornithology claimed they had taken a four-second video and recorded audio calls of the ivory-billed woodpecker, believed extinct for 60 years, in the refuge. The woodpecker has not been seen since and whether it was actually seen in 2005 remains a source of considerable debate. Much of the refuge was closed to the public following the announcement. After further research could not locate the woodpeckers, the refuge was reopened to the public in 2006.

==Recreation==
The refuge attracts 120,000 visitors annually. Hunting, fishing, canoeing, wildlife observation, and photography are popular. Deer, small game, duck, and goose hunting is allowed during seasons in the autumn and winter. Fishing is allowed year-round.

==Expansion plans==

In 2012 the FWS proposed a major expansion in the acreage of the Cache River Refuge. The boundaries of the area proposed by acquisition include within which land would be purchased from willing buyers and subject to the availability of funds. The objectives of the expansion are to restore the natural ecosystem of land that had been converted to agriculture, to reforest cleared land, and provide a buffer for the present refuge which consists mostly of a narrow corridor along the Cache River and Bayou DeView.

Three priority areas for purchase were identified. First, the FWS proposes to acquire up to 38,483 acres between the Cache River and Bayou DeView rivers. The addition of these lands to the refuge would enable the two watersheds to be re-connected and the 85 percent of the land now farmed to be reforested. Secondly, the FWS proposes to purchase 32,600 acres to extend the refuge about 30 miles northward in a narrow strip, now only six percent forested, along Bayou DeView. The third priority area for purchase is the Cache River Peripheral with 29,997 acres which to partially connect the Cache River Refuge with protected lands along the White River. Unique to the Lower Valley of the Mississippi River about 13 percent of this area consists of sand dunes with vegetation adapted to dryer climates.

As there are several hundred landowners in the priority areas, acquisition of the land will likely take many years.

<text>This is a list of monarchs of Korea, arranged by dynasty. Names are romanized according to the South Korean Revised Romanization of Korean. McCune–Reischauer romanizations may be found at the articles about the individual monarchs.

==Gojoseon==
Gojoseon (2333 BC – 108 BC) was the first Korean kingdom. According to legend, it was founded by Dangun in 2333 BC.

Bronze Age archaeological evidence of Gojoseon culture is found in northern Korea and Liaoning. By the 9th to 4th century BC, various historical and archaeological evidence shows Gojoseon was a flourishing state and a self-declared kingdom.

Both Dangun and Gija are believed to be mythological figures, but recent findings suggest and theorize that since Gojoseon was a kingdom with artifacts dating back to the 4th millennium BC, Dangun and Gija may have been royal or imperial titles used for the monarchs of Gojoseon, hence the use of Dangun for 1900 years.

===Earliest mythological rulers===

===Historical rulers===

==Buyeo==
Buyeo (c. 2nd century BC – 494 AD) ruled in modern-day Northeast China. Although records are sparse and contradictory, it is speculated that in the 1st century BC, Eastern Buyeo branched out, after which the original Buyeo is sometimes referred to as Northern Buyeo. Its remnants were absorbed by the neighboring and brotherhood kingdom of Goguryeo in 494.

===Early Eastern Buyeo===
===Galsa Buyeo===
=== Later Northern Buyeo ===
==Goguryeo==
Goguryeo (37 BC – 668 AD) was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Goguryeo rulers may have used the title of &quot;Taewang&quot; (太王, &quot;Greatest King&quot;).

==Baekje==
Baekje (18 BC – 660 AD) was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Temple names were the same as personal names, unless noted otherwise.

==Silla==
Silla (57 BC – 935 AD) was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the early years, Silla was ruled by the Pak, Seok, and Kim families. Rulers of Silla had various titles, including &quot;Isageum, Maripgan, and Daewang&quot;. Like some Baekje kings, some declared themselves emperor.

==Gaya confederacy==
The Gaya confederacy (42–562) consisted of several small statelets. All rulers of Gaya bore the title &quot;Wang&quot; (&quot;King&quot;).

===Geumgwan Gaya===
Geumgwan Gaya (42–532) was one of the Gaya confederacy.

===Daegaya===
Daegaya (42–562) was one of the Gaya confederacy.

==Tamna==
Tamna (2337 BC(?)–938 AD) was an ancient local kingdom on Jeju Island.

==Balhae==

Balhae (698–926) was an ancient Korean kingdom established after the fall of Goguryeo. Balhae occupied southern parts of Northeast China, Primorsky Krai, and the northern part of the Korean peninsula.

== Later Baekje ==
Later Baekje (900–936) was founded by Kyŏn Hwŏn, who was a general during Later Silla&#x27;s period of decline. Thus began the Later Three Kingdoms period. Later Baekje met its downfall at the hands of Kyŏn Hwŏn himself, who later led the Goryeo armies alongside Taejo of Goryeo to capture Kyŏn Sin-gŏm, who had betrayed his father, Kyŏn Hwŏn, and usurped the throne.

== Later Goguryeo ==
Taebong (901–918), also known as Majin or Later Goguryeo, was established by Gung-ye, an outcast prince of Silla. Gung-Ye joined General Yang Gil&#x27;s rebellion, and rose through the ranks. He eventually assassinated Yang-Gil and established a new kingdom, naming it Later Goguryeo. Gung-Ye turned out to be a tyrant, and was overthrown by his generals, opening the way for General Wang Geon, who established Goryeo.

==Goryeo dynasty==
Goryeo (918–1392) was ruled by the Wang Dynasty. The first ruler had the temple name &quot;Taejo,&quot; which means &quot;great progenitor&quot;, and was applied to the first kings of both Goryeo and Joseon, as they were also the founders of the Wang and Yi Dynasties respectively. Starting with Gwangjong, rulers of Goryeo styled themselves emperors, with the first three rulers elevated to that title posthumously. With the Mongol conquest, however, the title of the ruler was demoted to a king, or &quot;Wang.&quot;

The next twenty-three kings (until Wonjong) are also referred to by their temple names, ending in &quot;jong&quot;. Beginning with Chungnyeol (the twenty-fifth king), all the remaining kings of Goryeo had the title &quot;Wang&quot; (&quot;King&quot;) as part of their temple names. Era names are in bracket where available.

==Joseon dynasty==

Joseon (1392–1910) followed Goryeo. In 1897, when Joseon became the Korean Empire, some of the Joseon kings were posthumously raised to the rank of emperors.

Joseon monarchs had temple names ending in &quot;jo&quot; or &quot;jong.&quot; &quot;Jo&quot; was given to the first kings/emperors of new lines within the dynasty, with the first king/emperor having the special name (Taejo), which means &quot;great progenitor&quot; (see also Goryeo). &quot;Jong&quot; was given to all other kings/emperors.

Two kings, Yeonsangun and Gwanghaegun, were not given temple names after their reigns ended.

Each monarch had a posthumous name that included either the title &quot;Wang&quot; (&quot;King&quot;), &quot;Hwangje&quot; (&quot;Emperor&quot;), &quot;Daewang&quot; (&quot;King &quot;X&quot; the Great&quot;), or &quot;Daeje&quot; (&quot;Emperor &quot;X&quot; the Great&quot;). For the sake of consistency, the title &quot;King/Emperor&quot; has been added to each monarch&#x27;s temple name in the list below.

* see Korean Empire section

== Korean Empire ==
In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed Joseon to be the Korean Empire, which lasted until 1910. Technically, the emperors can be referred to by their era names rather than their temple names, but the latter are commonly used.

<doc id="337730" wikidata="Q1014915" url="?curid=337730" title="BurgerTime">
<text>originally released as in Japan, is an arcade video game from Data East. It was published in 1982 for the DECO Cassette System. The player controls chef Peter Pepper who walks across oversized ingredients in a maze of platforms and ladders, causing them to fall and stack on buns below, eventually creating complete burgers. The chef is pursued by anthropomorphic hot dogs, fried eggs, and pickles. A limited supply of pepper can be thrown at aggressors immediately in front of Peter, briefly stunning them.

The game&#x27;s original title of &quot;Hamburger&quot; was changed to &quot;BurgerTime&quot; outside of Japan, which was also used for all ports and subsequent games in the series worldwide. In the United States, Data East USA licensed &quot;BurgerTime&quot; for distribution by Bally Midway as a standard dedicated arcade game. Data East also released &quot;BurgerTime&quot; in the United States through its DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the manufacturer&#x27;s name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artwork; the game itself is identical. 

The first home port of &quot;BurgerTime&quot; was released for the Intellivision console in 1983, followed by versions for other systems. There have been multiple sequels for both the arcade and home.

When Data East went bankrupt in 2003, G-Mode bought most of Data East&#x27;s intellectual properties, including &quot;BurgerTime&quot;, &quot;BurgerTime Deluxe&quot;, &quot;Super BurgerTime&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pepper&#x27;s Ice Cream Factory&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to build a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods. The player controls the protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, with a four-position joystick and a &quot;pepper&quot; button.

Each level is a maze of platforms and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (bun, meat patty, tomato, lettuce) are arranged. When Peter walks the full length of an ingredient, it falls to the level below, knocking down any ingredient that happens to be there. A burger is completed when all of its vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. The player must complete all burgers to finish the board.

Three types of enemy food items wander the maze: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. The player can score extra points by either crushing them under a falling ingredient or dropping an ingredient while they are on it. In the latter case, the ingredient falls two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Crushed or dropped enemies return to the maze after a short time.

At the start of the game, the player is given a limited number of pepper shots to use against enemies. Pressing the button causes Peter to shake a cloud of pepper in the direction he is facing; any enemy touching the cloud is briefly stunned, and Peter can safely move through them. Ice cream, coffee, and French fries appear on occasion, awarding bonus points and one extra pepper shot when collected.

There are six boards of increasing difficulty, with more burgers/ingredients, more enemies, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter to become cornered. After the player completes the sixth board, the cycle repeats. One life is lost whenever Peter touches a non-stunned enemy, and the game ends once all lives are lost.

==Ports==
Mattel Electronics obtained the rights to &quot;BurgerTime&quot; from Data East and released the Intellivision version in 1983. That year, they also released versions for the Atari 2600, Apple II, Aquarius, and, as a self-booting disk, the IBM PC. A version from Data East for the TI-99/4A was published in 1984. A ColecoVision port was published by Coleco in May 1984. Ports were released for the Famicom in 1985, MSX in 1986, Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 and Famicom Disk System in 1988.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Hamburger&quot; as the 11th highest-grossing arcade video game of 1982. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed &quot;Hamburger&quot; on their June 15, 1983 issue as being the twenty-third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

Following its North American debut at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in November 1982, it was reviewed by &quot;Video Games&quot; magazine, which listed it as the show&#x27;s fourth best game, while saying it was the &quot;stupidest, silliest game ever, and that&#x27;s why you couldn&#x27;t get people off the Burger Time games with a crowbar!&quot; The review praised the &quot;music, challenging mazes, and comical&quot; characters.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave it a positive review, comparing the level structure to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981), stating that &quot;BurgerTime&quot; has &quot;a charm all its own&quot; and praising the controls. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; called &quot;BurgerTime&quot; &quot;one of the real surprises of 1983 for the Intellivision&quot; and gave the ColecoVision version three-and-a-half stars out of four. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine gave the ColecoVision and Coleco Adam versions a positive review, stating that &quot;the terrific flavor&quot; of the arcade game remains but &quot;the playfield has been greatly reduced&quot;.

&quot;BurgerTime&quot; received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Videogame of the Year (Less than 16K ROM)&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===


An arcade spin-off, &quot;Peter Pepper&#x27;s Ice Cream Factory&quot; (1984), and an arcade sequel, (1990), were not widely released. &quot;Super BurgerTime&quot; stars Peter Pepper Jr. and allows two players to play at once. It is fairly true to the original, but with many added features and a different style of graphics.

A console-only sequel, &quot;Diner&quot;, was created after the 1984 purchase of Intellivision from Mattel by INTV Corp. It was programmed by Ray Kaestner, the programmer of the Intellivision version of &quot;BurgerTime&quot;. In &quot;Diner&quot;, Peter Pepper must kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms and down ramps to land on a large plate at the bottom of the screen, while avoiding or crushing enemy food items that are trying to stop him.

&quot;BurgerTime Deluxe&quot; was released for the Game Boy in 1991 featuring similar gameplay to the original arcade game. &quot;BurgerTime Deluxe&quot; was re-released for the Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy service.

A crossover with &quot;The Flintstones&quot; titled &quot;The Flintstones: BurgerTime in Bedrock&quot; was released on Game Boy Color in 2000.

Namco released &quot;BurgerTime Delight&quot; for mobile devices in 2007. It includes &quot;new graphics, characters and power-ups&quot;. There are six &quot;arcade levels&quot; and eight enhanced mode levels with perils of falling ice and rising fire from the grill. Besides the pepper of the classic game, there is now a salt shaker, that when collected stuns all enemies on the screen.

A 3D update, &quot;BurgerTime World Tour&quot;, was released in 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and in 2012 for WiiWare. It was delisted from Xbox Live Arcade in April 2014. G-Mode and XSEED Games released a re-imagining of the game on October 8, 2019, titled &quot;BurgerTime Party!&quot;, for the Nintendo Switch, with new modes and redesigns.

===Re-releases===
The arcade version of &quot;BurgerTime&quot; has been included in various collections, including &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: Midway Collection 2&quot; for the PlayStation and &quot;Data East Arcade Classics&quot; for the Wii. In late 2019/early 2020, it was released with fellow Data East titles &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, &quot;Caveman Ninja&quot; and &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; in an arcade cabinet for home use by manufacturer Arcade1Up. Although the cabinet comes with four games in one, its artwork features only the graphics of &quot;Burgertime&quot;.

The NES and FDS versions were available on the Wii Virtual Console. Its Game Boy counterpart &quot;BurgerTime Deluxe&quot; was released for the 3DS Virtual Console in 2011. The NES version is also included in the 2017 compilation &quot;Data East All-Star Collection&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The 1982 arcade version was released through the Arcade Archives series for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on July 30, 2020.

===Clones===
Clones for home systems include: &quot;Mr. Wimpy&quot;, &quot;Bear Bovver&quot;, &quot;Burger Chase&quot;, &quot;BurgerSpace&quot;, &quot;Chip Factory&quot;, &quot;Burger Boy!&quot;, &quot;Basic Burger&quot;, &quot;Barmy Burgers&quot;, &quot;Burger Builder&quot;, and &quot;Lunchtime&quot;. &quot;BurgerSpace&quot; is a 2007 open source clone.

===In popular culture===
Elements of &quot;BurgerTime&quot; were incorporated into the episode &quot;Gameboy&quot; of the DIC Entertainment animated series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. Peter Pepper appears in the movies &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; and &quot;Pixels&quot;. A &quot;BurgerTime&quot; parody called &quot;Burgerboss&quot; appears in an episode of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; with the same name.

==Scores==
On September 5, 2005, Bryan L. Wagner of Turbotville, Pennsylvania achieved a record score of 8,601,300 and improved to exactly 9,000,000 on June 2, 2006. According to Twin Galaxies, he improved it further to 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008, at the Challenge Arcade in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The MAME world record was verified by Twin Galaxies on December 2, 2016, as 7,837,750 by Roger Edwin Blair III of Mountain City, Tennessee.

<text>As of 2022, there are 588 National Wildlife Refuges in the United States, with the addition of the Green River National Wildlife Refuge. Refuges that have boundaries in multiple states are listed only in the state where the main visitor entrance is located. The newest refuge replaces the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania. Refuges are listed regardless of whether or not they are open to the public, which many are not.

The United States is divided into eight regions for administrative purposes:

<text>Sadie Liza Frost (née Vaughan; born 19 June 1965) is an English actress, producer and fashion designer. Her credits as an actress include &quot;Empire State&quot; (1987), &quot;Diamond Skulls&quot;, also known as &quot;Dark Obsession&quot; (1989), &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990), &quot;Magic Hunter&quot; (1994), &quot;Shopping&quot; (1994), &quot;A Pyromaniac&#x27;s Love Story&quot; (1995), &quot;Flypaper&quot; (1997), &quot;Final Cut&quot; (1998), &quot;Captain Jack&quot; (1999), &quot;Love, Honour and Obey&quot; (2000), &quot;Beyond the Rave&quot; (2008), &quot;Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot; (2015), and &quot;A Bird Flew In&quot; (2021). She later directed &quot;Quant&quot; (2021), a documentary about the life of Mary Quant, one of the most influential fashion designers of the 20th Century. She also directed &quot;Twiggy&quot; (2024), a documentary about the model and cultural icon Twiggy, whose real name is Lesley Hornsby Lawson.

==Early life==
Frost was born in Islington, North London, in 1965 to psychedelic artist David Vaughan, who worked for the Beatles, and actress Mary Davidson, who was sixteen at the time of her birth.

She has described her childhood as a &quot;chaotic but positive experience&quot;. She spent much of her youth in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, after her parents separated. She has ten siblings, including fellow actresses Holly Davidson and Jade Davidson; primary school teacher Jessi Frost; brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet.

Frost attained a scholarship to attend the Italia Conti Academy. In 2019, she furthered her education, by taking a master’s degree in film production.

==Career==
Frost&#x27;s debut film role was in &quot;Empire State&quot; (1987), in a cast which included Martin Landau. She played the part of Rebecca in the 1989 film &quot;Diamond Skulls&quot; (also known as &quot;Dark Obsession&quot;), alongside Amanda Donohoe, and Gabriel Byrne. She later said that this role paved the way for her film appearance as the beautiful, ill-fated Lucy Westenra in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992). 

In the early 90s, she appeared in music videos, including for Pulp&#x27;s song &quot;Common People&quot;, Planet Perfecto featuring Grace&#x27;s &quot;Not Over Yet &#x27;99&quot;, various productions for Spandau Ballet, where she met first husband Gary Kemp. During their marriage, they appeared together in two films, &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990), and &quot;Magic Hunter&quot; (1994). 

In 1994, Frost met her future husband when she took a role opposite Jude Law in Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s directorial film debut &quot;Shopping&quot;. Frost and Law were to appear together again in the British gangster comedy &quot;Love, Honour and Obey&quot; (2000), alongside Ray Winstone, Jonny Lee Miller, Kathy Burke, Sean Pertwee, Denise Van Outen, and Rhys Ifans.

In 1997, Frost and Law co-founded the production company Natural Nylon, along with others including Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor, and Sean Pertwee. After six years, the company closed down. In 1999, Frost co-founded the fashion label Frost French with her friend Jemima French. 

In 2004, she wrote, presented and produced a short-lived series &quot;What Sadie did next...&quot; for E4, and in 2006 appeared in &quot;Eating with... Sadie Frost&quot; on BBC2, to talk about her switch to vegetarianism. 

Frost has been a member of the jury at the British Independent Film Awards, on two occasions, in 1999 and 2022.

==Personal life==
Frost had an eating disorder in her youth. In 1981, when 16 and dancing in a music video, Frost met Spandau Ballet&#x27;s Gary Kemp. They married on 7 May 1988. Their son Finlay was born in 1990. Frost and Kemp were married for seven years and divorced on 19 August 1995.

Frost met Jude Law during the work on the 1994 film &quot;Shopping&quot;. They married in September 1997 and have three children, including Rafferty and Iris. Frost and Law divorced on 29 October 2003. Kate Moss is godparent to one child and Nick Grimshaw to another.

Frost maintains she has never been a party animal, having been too busy being a mother, and she has maintained a healthy lifestyle of exercise, yoga and being a vegetarian.

Frost was a victim of the News International phone hacking scandal, after it was found that they intruded on her private life, damaged her reputation as a successful businesswoman, and caused embarrassment and humiliation on issues that would have been kept private. She received an apology from Mirror Group Newspapers, and was awarded damages.

<doc id="337740" wikidata="Q107325" url="?curid=337740" title="Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)">
<text>Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula is a 1992 American gothic horror film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and written by James V. Hart, based on the 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker. The film stars Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Keanu Reeves, with Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes, Billy Campbell, Sadie Frost, and Tom Waits in supporting roles. Set in 19th-century England and Romania, it follows the eponymous vampire (Oldman), who falls in love with Mina Murray (Ryder), the fiancée of his solicitor Jonathan Harker (Reeves). When Dracula begins terrorizing Mina&#x27;s friends, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Hopkins), an expert in vampirism, is summoned to bring an end to his reign of terror. Its closing credits theme &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot;, was written and performed by Annie Lennox.

&quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on November 13, 1992. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Coppola&#x27;s direction, the production values, and Oldman&#x27;s performance, although Reeves&#x27; performance was universally panned. The film opened at the top of the box office, grossing $215.9 million against its $40 million budget, and was nominated in four categories at the 65th Academy Awards, winning Best Costume Design for Eiko Ishioka, Best Sound Editing, and Best Makeup, while also being nominated for Best Art Direction.

== Plot ==
In 1462, Vlad Dracula returns from a victory in his campaign against the Ottoman Empire to find his beloved wife Elisabeta has committed suicide after his enemies falsely reported his death. A priest of the Romanian Orthodox Church tells him that his wife&#x27;s soul is damned to Hell for committing suicide. Enraged, Vlad desecrates the chapel and renounces God, declaring he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. He then drives his sword into the chapel&#x27;s stone cross and drinks the blood that pours from it, becoming a vampire.

In 1897, solicitor Jonathan Harker takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula as a client from his colleague R. M. Renfield, who has gone insane and is now an inmate in Dr. Jack Seward&#x27;s asylum. Jonathan travels to Dracula&#x27;s castle in Transylvania to arrange Dracula&#x27;s real estate acquisitions in London. There, he meets Dracula, who finds a picture of his fiancée Mina Murray and believes she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be fed upon by his brides, while he sails to England with Transylvanian soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey.

In London, Dracula hypnotically seduces and bites Mina&#x27;s best friend Lucy Westenra, with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy&#x27;s deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt former suitors Quincey Morris and Dr. Seward, along with her fiancé Arthur Holmwood to summon Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Seward&#x27;s mentor, who recognizes Lucy as being the victim of a vampire. Dracula, appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. Mina develops feelings for Dracula, accompanying him on several outings. When Mina receives word from Jonathan—who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent—she travels to Romania to marry him. A heartbroken Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward, and Morris kill the undead Lucy the following night.

After he and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count&#x27;s boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum and kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence. He visits Mina, who is staying in Seward&#x27;s quarters, and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina&#x27;s friends. Though furious at first, Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers Elisabeta&#x27;s previous life; at her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The hunters burst into the bedroom, and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping. As Mina changes, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The hunters depart for Varna to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina&#x27;s mind and evades them. The hunters split up; Van Helsing and Mina travel to the Borgo Pass and the castle, while the others try to stop the Romani transporting Dracula.

At night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula&#x27;s brides. Mina succumbs to their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood, Van Helsing places a communion wafer on her forehead, leaving a mark that slows her transformation. He surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides, then kills the brides the following morning. Dracula&#x27;s carriage arrives at the castle, pursued by the hunters. A fight between the hunters and Romani ensues. Morris is fatally stabbed in the back and Dracula bursts from his coffin at sunset. Jonathan slits his throat with a kukri knife while Morris stabs him in the heart. Van Helsing and Jonathan allow Mina to retreat with the Count while Morris dies in the arms of Seward, comforted by his friends.

In the chapel where he renounced God, Dracula lies dying. He and Mina share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself. Dracula reverts to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace. Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he dies, the mark on her forehead disappears freeing her from his curse. She then decapitates him and gazes up at a fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to heaven together, finally reunited.

== Cast ==
== Themes ==
===The Other===
In Stoker&#x27;s original novel, the Count is described through various terms of otherness. His foreign image and customs are translated into the monstrous &quot;Other&quot;, leading to an identity for the reader between the foreign and the monstrous. Dracula as a foreign &quot;Other&quot; is set as the marked term. The characters of Jonathan Harker and Mina Murray in the novel represent the British Empire, which provides the unmarked, or normal, perspective in &quot;Dracula&quot;. According to Deborah S. Wilson, &quot;Dracula, produced at the apogee of Britain&#x27;s Empire, projects anxious themes of invasion and colonization upon a foreign culture, embodied in Count Dracula himself. As the feudal lord of a mysterious Balkan country, Dracula himself is described in consistently orientalist terms, terms that stress his racial alterity in all but purely negative terms&quot;. Coppola&#x27;s film reflects the change in attitude toward the racial Other that occurs over roughly a century by the 1990s, as in the film the general story and plot remain the same with certain important details changed to reflect the difference in racial understanding: the emotional connection between Mina Murray and Dracula in the film stretches beyond the racial boundaries and allowing a genuine interracial relationship to occur. According to John Allen Stevenson the threat of the racial &quot;Other&quot; was &quot;the real horror of Dracula, for he is the ultimate social adulterer, whose purpose is nothing if it is not to turn good Englishwomen...like Mina away from their own kind and customs&quot;. Meanwhile in the film the interracial relationship between vampire (Dracula) and human (Mina) becomes permissible, culminating in the union of the human and the Other.

===Occultism===

Coppola&#x27;s film makes a direct connection between Dracula&#x27;s vampiric origin and occultism/satanism. In the opening scene of the film, after learning that his wife committed suicide and is denied salvation, Dracula denies God and makes a deal with the dark forces. This is symbolically verified with Dracula plunging his sword into the crucifix, which immediately starts to bleed excessive amounts of blood that Dracula drinks as a sign of &quot;bloodpact&quot; with the Devil.

===AIDS pandemic===
Upon release, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Frank Rich suggested that the film drew upon the prevalent fear of HIV/AIDS in the 1990s, a disease transmissible via contact/transfer of blood. Coppola, according to Rich, gives to the viewers a movie that both frightens and arouses them by playing off their unchecked fear of the spread of AIDS as an invasion of the national bloodstream.

Van Helsing comments to his medical students that civilization and &quot;&quot; advanced together; this is viewed as much as a commentary on Coppola&#x27;s times—during the spread of HIV/AIDS—as it was on Stoker&#x27;s (who may have died of syphilis, as speculated in some biographies of Stoker).

== Production ==
=== Development and casting ===
Ryder initially brought the script (written by James V. Hart) to the attention of Coppola. The director had agreed to meet with her so the two could clear the air after her late withdrawal from &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; caused production delays on that film and led her to believe Coppola disliked her. According to Ryder: &quot;I never really thought he would read it. He was so consumed with &quot;Godfather III&quot;. As I was leaving, I said, &#x27;If you have a chance, read this script.&#x27; He glanced down at it politely, but when he saw the word Dracula, his eyes lit up. It was one of his favorite stories from camp.&quot; Ryder also explained that &quot;what attracted me to the script is the fact that it&#x27;s a very emotional love story, which is not really what you think of when you think about Dracula. Mina, like many women in the late 1800s, has a lot of repressed sexuality. Everything about women in that era, the way those corsets forced them to move, was indicative of repression. To express passion was freakish&quot;. Coppola was also attracted to the sensual elements of the screenplay and said that he wanted portions of the picture to resemble an &quot;erotic dream&quot;. To prepare for &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, as the movie would be called, Coppola screened &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; and Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;. In the months leading up to its release, Hollywood insiders who had seen the movie felt Coppola&#x27;s film was too odd, violent and strange to succeed at the box office, and dubbed it &quot;Bonfire of the Vampires&quot; after the notorious 1990 box-office bomb &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.

Gary Oldman has stated that he never considered Count Dracula to be a &quot;&quot; role for him. He said about the main reason why he agreed to the role: &quot;It was an opportunity to work with Coppola, who I consider one of the great American directors. That was enough, really. It was my first big American movie, made on a big set with lots of costumes. For a young actor, that was a tremendous experience.&quot; Another reason why Oldman wanted to play Dracula was because he wanted to say: &quot;I&#x27;ve crossed oceans of time to find you&quot; and to him it was worth playing the role just to say that line.

Christian Slater was offered the role of Jonathan Harker, but he turned it down (a decision he later regretted). As for casting Keanu Reeves in the role, Coppola said of his casting choice: &quot;We tried to get some kind of matinée idol for the part of Jonathan, because it isn&#x27;t such a great part. If we all were to go to the airport [...] Keanu is the one that the girls would just besiege.&quot; Coppola has stated that Reeves worked harder on his accent than most people realized: &quot;He tried so hard. That was the problem, actually—he wanted to do it perfectly and in trying to do it perfectly it came off as stilted. I tried to get him to just relax with it and not do it so fastidiously. So maybe I wasn&#x27;t as critical of him, but that&#x27;s because I like him personally so much. To this day he&#x27;s a prince in my eyes.&quot;

=== Costume, set, hair and makeup design ===

Coppola chose to invest a significant amount of the budget in costumes in order to showcase the actors, whom he considered the &quot;jewels&quot; of the feature. The film itself was built on the stylistic premise that the costumes were of greater importance to the film&#x27;s execution than the sets. Due to this, designer Eiko Ishioka was given immense freedom to design not only Dracula&#x27;s clothes but also his personae. Ishioka decided that Dracula would be &quot;male and female, old and young, ugly and handsome, animal and human.&quot;

Coppola had a team of artists—veteran production artist Mentor Huebner, future Dreamworks Animation veteran turned &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; helmer and &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; co-director Peter Ramsey, and future &quot;Hellboy&quot; creator Mike Mignola—storyboard the entire film in advance to carefully illustrate each planned shot. This process created around a thousand images. He turned the drawings into a choppy animated film—an animatic—with added music, and spliced in scenes from the French version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; that Jean Cocteau directed in 1946 along with paintings by Gustav Klimt and other symbolist artists. He showed the animated film to his designers to give them an idea of the mood and theme he was aiming for. Coppola also asked the set costume designers to simply bring him designs which were &quot;weird&quot;. Weird&#x27; became a code word for &#x27;Let&#x27;s not do formula, he later recalled. Give me something that either comes from the research or that comes from your own nightmares.&#x27; I gave them paintings, and I gave them drawings, and I talked to them about how I thought the imagery could work.&quot;

The film&#x27;s hair and makeup designer, Michèle Burke, recalls: &quot;Francis didn&#x27;t want the typical Dracula that had already been done in Hollywood. He wanted something different; a new Dracula without the widow&#x27;s peak, cape, or pale-white skin.&quot; Burke says she used her Catholic upbringing and angelic imagery for design inspiration, as well as the 19th-century attire created by costume designer Eiko Ishioka.

Because Dracula&#x27;s scenes did not start filming until very late into the production, Oldman had plenty of downtime to come up with additional ideas for his character. According to Coppola, &quot;He&#x27;d [Oldman] get together with the makeup designer Greg Cannom and, before I knew it, we were going to have not just one monster but five monsters in the film.&quot; For Oldman, the makeup required for the role was taxing: for the elderly Dracula, he spent nearly seven hours in the makeup chair, then after ten hours on the set, spent another hour-and-a-half having it removed.

=== Filming ===
Due to delays and cost overruns on some of Coppola&#x27;s previous projects such as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, Coppola was determined to complete &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; on time and on budget. To accomplish this, he filmed on sound stages to avoid potential troubles caused by inclement weather.

While preparing to play Dracula, Oldman took lessons with a singing teacher in order to drive his voice one octave lower. Coppola brought his principal actors to his seventeen-hundred-acre Napa Valley winery and estate for improvisations and exercises. The actors read the novel aloud, went through the script, and sat down for communal dinners. The idea was to break down barriers and establish relationships that would translate to the film. The summer-camp atmosphere extended to all the principal actors except Oldman. The director instructed Elwes, Campbell, and Grant to go horseback-riding and hot-air ballooning together, getting to know each other and their characters better, and sent Ryder and Frost off to do things together, while Oldman was kept isolated from the cast; this extended to living arrangements throughout filming, with all the vampire hunters living on one property and Oldman living on another. The rest of the cast met Oldman for the first time on set during rehearsals, after which they would not see him again until filming.

Coppola brought in acting coach Greta Seacat to coach Frost and Ryder for their erotic scenes, as he felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality with the young actresses. However, he did ask Oldman to speak seductively off camera to Frost while they were filming a scene in which she writhed alone in her bed in ecstasy. She later classified the things Oldman said to her as &quot;very unrepeatable&quot;. Winona Ryder found the intensity of Oldman&#x27;s acting style too much at times; the two fell out early in the filming process and had difficulty working together from then on. Coppola stated, &quot;they got along and then one day they didn&#x27;t—absolutely didn&#x27;t get along. None of us were privy to what had happened.&quot; Ryder has referred to the &quot;trauma&quot; of the experience and said that she &quot;felt there was a danger&quot; while working with Oldman. However, she has also referred to her friction with Oldman as &quot;teen drama&quot;, stating, &quot;He [Gary] was going through a divorce, and I think I can say this because he&#x27;s pretty open about it, but he&#x27;s been sober for a long time now, and he&#x27;s raised three kids, and he&#x27;s a dream. He&#x27;s a good friend of mine now&quot;.

In 2020, Winona Ryder also stated that Reeves and Hopkins once refused Coppola&#x27;s direction to verbally abuse her to make her cry during a scene that required an emotional reaction. However, Coppola denied this and described the situation as him instructing Oldman—in character—to whisper improvised words both to her and other actors on set to scare them. Ryder agreed with Coppola, and a spokesperson for Ryder stated that &quot;He asked the actors in character to say horrible things to Winona as a technique to help her cry for the scene. Although that technique didn&#x27;t work for her, she loves and respects him and considers it a great privilege to have worked with him.&quot;

=== Special effects ===
Coppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as computer-generated imagery when making the movie, instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema, which he felt would be more appropriate given that the film&#x27;s period setting coincides with the origin of film. He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son Roman Coppola. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer-generated effects, instead utilizing on-set and in-camera methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of compositing were instead achieved by either rear projection with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through multiple exposure by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using matting techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. Forced perspectives were often employed to combine miniature effects or matte paintings with full-sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics. When filming Dracula&#x27;s POV, Roman took individual images with his camera in an erratic way, sometimes only a few random frames per second, and then sudden bursts of several frames per second. For Lucy&#x27;s movements, she did her performance backwards, and the film then processed in reverse.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Overblown in the best sense of the word, Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s vision of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; rescues the character from decades of campy interpretations—and features some terrific performances to boot.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby described the film as having been created with the &quot;enthusiasm of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master&#x27;s command of his craft.&quot; Richard Corliss said, &quot;Coppola brings the old spook story alive [...] Everyone knows that Dracula has a heart; Coppola knows that it is more than an organ to drive a stake into. To the director, the count is a restless spirit who has been condemned for too many years to interment in cruddy movies. This luscious film restores the creature&#x27;s nobility and gives him peace.&quot; Alan Jones in &quot;Radio Times&quot; said, &quot;Eerie, romantic and operatic, this exquisitely mounted revamp of the undead legend is a supreme artistic achievement [...] as the tired count who has overdosed on immortality, Gary Oldman&#x27;s towering performance holds centre stage and burns itself into the memory.&quot;

Roger Ebert awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing, &quot;I enjoyed the movie simply for the way it looked and felt. Production designers Dante Ferretti and Thomas Sanders have outdone themselves. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, gets into the spirit so completely he always seems to light with shadows.&quot; Ebert did, however, voice criticisms over the film&#x27;s &quot;narrative confusions and dead ends&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum said the film suffered from a &quot;somewhat dispersed and overcrowded story line&quot; but that it &quot;remains fascinating and often affecting thanks to all its visual and conceptual energy.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;not particularly scary, not very sexy and dramatically over the top&quot;, criticizing the tone and several of the casting decisions. Tom Hibbert of &quot;Empire&quot; was unimpressed. Awarding the film 2 out of 5 stars, he said, &quot;Has a film ever promised so much yet delivered so little? [...] all we&#x27;re left with is an overly long bloated adaptation, instead of what might have been a gothic masterpiece.&quot; Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; also had reservations: &quot;[T]he romantic make-over of &quot;Dracula&quot; registers as little more than a marketing device designed to exploit the attractiveness of the movie&#x27;s youthful cast [...] [it] rolls on a patina of the &#x27;feel-good&#x27; uplift endemic in recent Hollywood movies.&quot;

==== Reeves&#x27; performance ====
&quot;Empire&quot;″s Tom Hibbert criticized Keanu Reeves&#x27;s casting and was not the only critic to consider the resultant performance to be weak. In a career retrospective compiled by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Reeves was described as having been &quot;out of his depth&quot; and &quot;frequently blasted off the screen by Gary Oldman&quot;. &quot;Total Film&quot; writer Nathan Ditum included Reeves in his 2010 countdown of &quot;The 29 Worst Movie Miscastings&quot;, describing him as &quot;a dreary, milky nothing [...] a black hole of sex and drama&quot;. Josh Winning, also of &quot;Total Film&quot;, said that Reeves&#x27;s work spoiled the movie. He mentioned it in a 2011 list of the &quot;50 Performances That Ruined Movies&quot;, and wrote: &quot;You can visibly see Keanu attempting not to end every one of his lines with &#x27;dude&#x27;. The result? A performance that looks like the young actor&#x27;s perpetually constipated. Painful for all parties.&quot; A feature by &quot;AskMen&quot;, called &quot;Acting Miscasts That Ruined Movies&quot;, expressed a similar sentiment: &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to cast Keanu Reeves as an esteemed British lawyer, but it&#x27;s quite another to ask him to act alongside Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins. The two Oscar nominees ran circles around the poor Canuck, exposing his lack of range, shoddy accent and abysmal instincts for all to see.&quot;

Reeves&#x27;s attempt at London vernacular has been cited as one of the worst accents, if not the worst, in the history of recorded film. Virgin Media journalist Limara Salt, in listing the &quot;Top 10 worst movie accents&quot;, wrote: &quot;Keanu Reeves is consistently terrible at delivering any accent apart from Californian surfer dude but it&#x27;s his English effort in &quot;Dracula&quot; that tops the lot. Overly posh and entirely ridiculous, Reeves&#x27;s performance is as painful as it is hilarious.&quot; Salt said that Winona Ryder is &quot;equally rubbish&quot;, an opinion echoed by Glen Levy in &quot;Time&quot;. In his &quot;Top 10 Worst Fake British Accents&quot;, he said that both actors &quot;come up short in the accent (and, some might argue, acting) department&quot;, and that their London dialect made for &quot;a literal horror show&quot;. Conversely, Marc Savlov, writing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, opined that Ryder was more impressive than Reeves and suited the role: &quot;Ryder, seemingly the perfect choice for Dracula&#x27;s obscure object of desire, Mina Harker, is better by far than Reeves&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; opened at number one at the US box office with a November record of $30,521,679, beating &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. This record was quickly surpassed by &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;. The film dropped off in subsequent weeks, losing 50.8% of its audience after its first weekend in release and exiting the top five after three weeks. It became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 in the United States and Canada, becoming the 15th-highest-grossing film of the year. The film set an opening weekend record in the United Kingdom of $4 million, beating the record set by &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. It also held the record for having the biggest opening weekend for an 18 certificate film until 1997 when &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; surpassed it. Internationally, the film grossed another $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.

As of 2023, adjusted for inflation, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;″s box office is $473.5 million, making it one of the highest-grossing vampire movies of all time.

=== Awards and nominations ===
== Soundtrack ==
In 2018, the soundtrack had a 3-CD set Limited Edition re-release: Disc One and Two of this re-issue presented the premiere of Kilar&#x27;s &quot;composed score&quot;, his music as originally written for the film. Disc Two also featured a bounty of alternate bonus cues from this material. Disc Three showcases the original 1992 album assembly, remastered, with additional bonus tracks.

== Home media ==
In 1993, the film received both a standard VHS release and a limited edition VHS release, the latter being a box set in the shape of a coffin. The limited edition release contained the film on VHS, which included a behind-the-scenes documentary, and the original &quot;Dracula&quot; novel by Bram Stoker in paperback. Grey, gothic statue heads (as seen on the original film poster) adorned the front cover of the book against a gray stone background. That same year, the Criterion Collection released a special edition LaserDisc of the film.

&quot;Dracula&quot; was first released to DVD in 1999 and again as a Superbit DVD in 2001. The DVD included several extra features: filmographies, the original theatrical trailer, a documentary (&quot;Dracula: The Man, The Myth, The Legend&quot;), costume designs and DVD trailers. The Superbit version did not contain any extra features.

A two-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD and Blu-ray was released in 2007. Special features include an introduction and audio commentary by director Francis Ford Coppola, deleted and extended scenes, teaser and full-length trailers, and the documentaries &quot;The Blood Is the Life: The Making of &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Costumes Are the Sets: The Design of Eiko Ishioka&quot;, &quot;In Camera: The Naïve Visual Effects of &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Method and Madness: Visualizing &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;.

A 4K release was put out in 2017, sourced from a new scan of the original negatives.

== Merchandise ==
A novelization of the film was published, written by Fred Saberhagen. A four-issue comic book adaptation and 100 collectible cards based on the movie were released by Topps Comics with art provided by Mike Mignola and a full script provided by Roy Thomas, using dialogue derived almost entirely from the film&#x27;s script. In 2018, IDW Publishing collected all four issues and released them in a trade paperback. Various action figures and model sets were also produced. In addition to these items, accurate licensed replicas of Dracula&#x27;s sword and Quincey&#x27;s Bowie knife were available from Factory X. Other merchandising for the film included a board game; a pinball machine, which was also adapted as a digital pinball game and re-released as downloadable content for &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot; until June 30, 2018; and video game adaptations for various platforms.

In 2021, Funko Pop vinyl figures from the film were announced for release: Van Helsing and three different versions of Dracula (in his old form, his young form in gray suit and top hat, and as Vlad Tepes in red armor). Thus, the film became the third live-action adaptation of Dracula that got Funko POPs (previous ones were Nosferatu, based on the 1922 film, and Dracula, based on the 1931 film).

== Legacy ==
The film had a considerable effect on popular culture and vampire representation in media. Costume design by Eiko Ishioka created a new image for the Count and for the first time freed him from the black cape and evening wear the character had become associated with since Bela Lugosi&#x27;s portrayal in 1931. The film was also a landmark in vampire horror as it is the only &quot;Dracula&quot; adaptation to win Oscars.

The film is seen as a game changer by many critics, which established a tone and style that redefined cinematic vampires. It created a host of new vampire film tropes, like retractable fangs, vampires turning into literal bat-men, and a steampunk aesthetic. &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, its partisans contend, is significant in the way that &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; were significant, in showing that a horror story can be worthy of an A-list cast and production values, and that a truly imaginative filmmaker can take even a story as hoary as Dracula and give it a new luster.

Coppola&#x27;s film began a cycle of prestige monster movies with big stars and name directors, as well as high production values and lavish costumes: &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994) directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Robert De Niro as Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster, &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994) directed by Mike Nichols and starring Jack Nicholson as a werewolf, and &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; (1996) directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Malkovich as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Julia Roberts as a maid who develops a crush on the mad doctor and his crooked other self. Coppola&#x27;s film also influenced the next major vampire movie/literary adaptation: in 1994 &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; directed by Neil Jordan was released starring Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt, Brad Pitt as Louis and Kirsten Dunst as Claudia. According to Jordan: &quot;Up to that point, Francis Ford Coppola with &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, he introduced opulence and theatricality. Normally, before that one, I always thought of vampire movies as cheap, cobbled together, brilliant use of minimal resources. Francis made it this epic, didn&#x27;t he? So when I was given the opportunity to make &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, I thought, &#x27;Oh, it would be really great to expand on that epic sense of darkness and to give these characters huge, kind of romantic destinies and longings and feelings.&#x27;&quot;

The film was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;5 best vampire movies&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;20 Best Vampire Movies&quot; and &quot;Sexiest Horror Movies Ever Made&quot;, &quot;IndieWire&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Best Horror Movies of All Time&quot; and &quot;The 12 Best Vampire Movies Ever Made&quot;. Oldman&#x27;s Dracula featured in &quot;Forbes&quot;″s list of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Most Powerful Vampires&quot;, as well as &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;10 best screen vampires&quot;. He also was ranked as best version of Dracula by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;. In honor of Syfy&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2017, the channel compiled &quot;25 greatest&quot; lists celebrating the last 25 years of all science fiction, fantasy, and horror: Oldman&#x27;s Dracula was included in &quot;The 25 Greatest Movie Performances from the Last 25 years&quot;.
* The Action-Adventure gothic horror video game series &quot;Castlevania&quot; (Castlevania first released in 1986 with its first video game, 6 years before the movie), resembles the film in several parts. In the game &quot;&quot; (2003)—the origins of the series&#x27; premise—Mathias Cronqvist, the man who would be Dracula after the death of his wife, Elisabetha, sought vengeance against God for her death and turned into a vampire, betraying Leon Belmont in the process and igniting the centuries-old war between the Belmonts and Count Dracula. In the game &quot;&quot; (1997) [the plot of the game chronologically takes places much later than in &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; in 1797] appeared another character, Lisa, second wife of Dracula and mother of his son Alucard. Lisa is killed in the year 1475, accused of being a witch. This kickstarts the events of Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse, released in 1989, a year later. She was killed and her death sent Dracula into rage and bloody revenge against humanity. Lisa is the spitting image of Elisabetha Cronqvist, her name is also the short form of the name Elisabetha.
* The Mel Brooks comedy &quot;&quot; starring Leslie Nielsen is a direct parody of this film. The count&#x27;s costume and the scenes with Dracula&#x27;s shadow are direct references to the Coppola movie.
* Fox&#x27;s comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot; December 1992 skit &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Wanda&quot; spoofs the film with Jim Carrey playing Dracula.
* The 1993 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot; had a segment titled &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Dracula&quot; which is a parody of this film with Mr. Burns as a vampire.
* Japanese manga and anime series &quot;Hellsing&quot; resembles the film: the backstory of Alucard (Count Dracula turned vampire slayer in the Hellsing&#x27;s Universe) in manga includes him sailing to England in search of his love reborn and also makes the direct connection in anime between Alucard (Count Dracula) and Vlad the Impaler.
* In &quot;Anno Dracula&quot;, an alternative history novel series by Kim Newman, where Count Dracula won and spread vampirism across the world—in &quot;Dracula Cha Cha Cha&quot;, Count Dracula&#x27;s first wife is mentioned as &quot;Elisabeta of Transylvania&quot;; the name was taken from this film version (Vlad the Impaler&#x27;s first wife&#x27;s name is unknown historically).
*&quot;&quot; (original title: , 1993), a nonfiction book by French vampire myth specialist Jean Marigny, is a reaction to Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, published by Éditions Gallimard. After the film, media coverage around vampires was in full swing, and Gallimard, for their &quot;Découvertes&quot; collection, was looking for an author to write a book about vampires. After a few weeks of intensive work, the book came out in 1993 to match the release of the film in France.
* &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot; (2014) heavily references this film. Jemaine Clement based his performance as Vladislav on Gary Oldman&#x27;s portrayal. &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot; (2019) has a vampire character Baron Afanas (played by Doug Jones), who is also partly inspired by Oldman&#x27;s Dracula. The TV series also has a plotline where vampire Nadja meets a reincarnation of her past lover and says she crossed oceans of time to be with him.
* Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro had props from this film as part of his &quot;At Home With Monsters&quot; public exhibition, including the red Dracula helmet from the prologue of the film. The exhibition toured US and Canada.
* Jessica Chastain said that she incorporated some inspiration from her younger days into her acting (and wardrobe) as Lucille Sharpe in gothic romance film &quot;Crimson Peak&quot; (2015): &quot;My friend and I used &quot;Dracula&quot; as our reference—the one with Gary Oldman; we were Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost, she wore black lipstick and I wore a black-red lip color, like dried blood almost.&quot;
* &quot;Stranger Things&quot; season two episode &quot;Chapter Two: Trick or Treat, Freak&quot; (2017) has a scene where Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) celebrates Halloween with her boyfriend Bob Newby (Sean Astin) dressed as Dracula; the couple share a dance together as an homage to the film.
* &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024) directed by Tim Burton introduced the similar character dynamics for the characters of Betelgeuse, Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder) and Delores (Monica Bellucci) to the dynamics Oldman&#x27;s Dracula, Ryder&#x27;s Mina and Bellucci&#x27;s bride had in the movie. Much like in &quot;Bram Stoker’s Dracula&quot;, Ryder’s Lydia is the mortal woman whom the horror movie’s supernatural and deceased villain Betelgeuse is obsessed with, and even keeps her photo as a token of his obsession. Likewise, both Bellucci’s undead soul-sucker Betelgeuse&#x27;s ex-wife Delores and Dracula&#x27;s vampire bride are already the dead wife/bride of the main villain, with the villain not caring about her, but caring about the human woman. At the end of the movie Lydia (seemingly) even takes her daughter Astrid (Jenna Ortega) on a trip to Dracula&#x27;s Castle in Romania, where Astrid takes a liking to a Dracula-performer-employee called &quot;Vlad&quot;.
