<text>İmralı is a small Turkish prison island in the south of the Sea of Marmara, west of the Armutlu-Bozburun peninsula within Bursa Province. It measures in the north–south direction with a width of , and has an area of . The highest peak is &quot;Türk Tepesi&quot; at an altitude of above sea level. It is prohibited to fly over it or fish near its shores.

== History ==
The Roman authors Pliny the Elder and Strabo called the island Besbicus (). It was later known as Kalonymos () and Kalolimnos (). In antiquity, it was a member of the Delian League since it appears in tribute records of Athens between 434/3 and 418/7 BCE.

The Turkish name &quot;İmralı&quot; derives from the name of the island&#x27;s conqueror, Emir Ali, one of the first Ottoman admirals. In 1308 İmralı became the first island to be conquered by the newly established Ottoman Navy. Its strategic location enabled the Ottomans to control the movement of ships in the Sea of Marmara with a naval base established on it, cutting the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s connection to Bursa. The island is also referred as &quot;Mir Ali&quot; in Ottoman documents. The island was also a place of refuge for the runaways of the Devshirme System. For example in 1567, a group of runaways was protected and hidden by the locals of Mir Ali Island while the batches of children were being transported from the port of Dutlimanı in Bandırma.

In 1913, the island had 250 houses, a school, three monasteries, and 1,200 residents, all of whom were Greeks. The economic activity of the island&#x27;s residents consisted mainly of fishing and farming onions, with most of the grown onions sold to Istanbul. There were three Greek villages on the island, engaged mostly in growing grapes, winemaking, silk production and fishing, until the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923). One well-known islander was Kimon Friar who emigrated to the United States and became a scholar and translator of Greek language poetry. The island was depopulated by the 1923 forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey and remained uninhabited for thirteen years.

In 1936, the Turkish government opened a newly semi-open prison, where the prisoners earned money by working in agriculture and fishing. Following the 1960 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, the deposed Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the island. From 1999 until 2009, the now-maximum-security prison housed a single inmate, Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK. All the other prisoners on the island had been transferred to mainland Turkey. In November 2009, several other prisoners, including 4
PKK and one TKP/ML, were transferred to a newly constructed building.

There is now a military base on the island and the surrounding area is a forbidden zone.

<text>The Woolwich Ferry is a free vehicle and pedestrian ferry across the River Thames in East London, connecting Woolwich on the south bank with North Woolwich on the north. It is licensed and financed by London River Services, the maritime arm of Transport for London (TfL). Around two million passengers use the ferry each year.

A ferry has operated on the Thames at Woolwich since the 14th century, and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid-19th. The free service opened in 1889 after tolls were abolished on bridges to the west of London. Traffic increased in the 20th century because of the rise in motor vehicle traffic and it remained popular because of the lack of nearby bridges. Pedestrian use dropped after the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich Arsenal station. Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements, but there are no plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as long as there is demand.

==Services==

The service links Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with North Woolwich in the London Borough of Newham. It also links two ends of the inner London orbital road routes: the North Circular and the South Circular.

On weekdays, the ferry operates from 6.10 am until 8 pm with a two-boat service (10 minutes nominal interval between sailings); on Saturdays, from 6.10 am to 8 pm with a one-boat service (15 minutes nominal interval; the last south-to-north sailing is 15 minutes earlier at 7.45 pm); on Sundays, from 11.30 am to 7.30 pm with a one-boat service (last south-to-north sailing at 7.15 pm). The ferries can carry heavy goods vehicles and other road traffic across the river, up to a maximum height of and width of . The service is free for all traffic; in 2012 Transport for London (TfL) estimated a subsidy cost of 76.5p per passenger.

===Nearest alternative crossings===
The nearest alternative crossing for pedestrians is the Woolwich foot tunnel about 100 metres (110 yds) to the east. A Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station, Woolwich Arsenal on the south side of the Thames, was opened in January 2009 as the new terminus of the London City Airport branch. King George V DLR station, on the opposite side of the river, is close to the north ferry dock.

The nearest vehicle alternatives are the Blackwall Tunnel about upstream to the west, or the Dartford Crossing around downstream to the east. Both tunnels have height restrictions for heavy goods vehicles, and users of the Dartford Crossing incur toll charges.

==History==

===Early services===
There has been a connection across the Thames between what is now Old Woolwich and what would later be North Woolwich since the Norman Conquest. The area was mentioned in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as belonging to Hamon, the &quot;dapifer&quot; (steward), &quot;which belong to (pertinent in) Woolwich&quot;; the &quot;pertinent&quot; here refers to the portion of land north of the Thames yet also part of the county of Kent. State papers in 1308 show that a service was running between North Woolwich and Warren Lane. That year, William de Wicton sold the business to William atte Halle for £10. The ferry was subsequently sold in 1320 for 100 silver marks.


Cross-river traffic increased following the establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671. To enable movement of troops and supplies, the army established its own ferry in 1810. The following year the (51 Geo. 3. c. cxcix) established a commercial ferry company, but it was dissolved in 1844. In 1846, the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880, a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but the cost was seen as prohibitive.

Following the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free public use, it was suggested that the board should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London. Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich, but the latter plan was abandoned. In 1884 the board agreed to provide two steam-powered ferries, each costing £10,650, and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction. In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at £54,900 to build approaches, bridges and pontoons.

===Modern service===
The service was officially opened on 23 March 1889, with the paddle steamer &quot;Gordon&quot;. Two days before the first service, the Metropolitan Board of Works was replaced by the London County Council (LCC), and the opening ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette. The sister vessel &quot;Duncan&quot; was introduced on 20 April.

By the end of the 1920s, the rise in motor traffic had put pressure on the ferry&#x27;s capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter&#x27;s Hill and East Ham was rejected as too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.
By the 1950s it was quicker for ferry traffic to divert via the Blackwall Tunnel even with all three vessels operating at full capacity. In April 1963, the paddle steamers were replaced and the ferry service upgraded to a more modern roll-on/roll-off model, reducing waiting times on the approach roads. The LCC continued to operate the ferry until it was replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC) on 31 March 1965. In 1964, Marples Ridgway started building the current reinforced concrete terminals, which can operate over a tidal range. The current terminals were opened in 1966.

After the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the responsibility for operating the service was transferred to the Secretary of State for Transport, who contracted the then London Borough of Greenwich to run the service. Asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to Transport for London (TfL) on the establishment of the Greater London Authority, but the London Borough of Greenwich continued to operate the ferry on behalf of TfL.

In March 2008, the London Borough of Greenwich gave TfL notice that it would cease operating the service from 30 September 2008. On 12 September TfL announced that the outsourcing group Serco would take over the operation of the service from 1 October 2008; the contract ran initially until 31 March 2010. Control of the crossing passed from Serco to Briggs Marine, which was expanding into public passenger services, in December 2012. The company was awarded a £50 million seven-year contract, which began in April 2013.

In 2014, TfL began an upgrade of the ferry service, starting by refurbishing the piers and in 2016 ordering two new boats to replace the existing vessels that were nearing the end of their working life. In early 2017, it was announced that the new ferries were being built by Polish firm Remontowa to a design by Norwegian company LMG Marin. The diesel-electric hybrid vessels have of space for road vehicles over several lanes and dedicated cyclist accommodation. The vessels are licensed to carry 150 passengers segregated from road traffic. Continuing the tradition of naming the ferries after local people, it was announced in June 2017 that the two new vessels would be named after Dame Vera Lynn, a singer and entertainer from nearby East Ham, and Ben Woollacott, the 19-year-old deckhand on the Woolwich Ferry who drowned after being dragged overboard in a mooring accident in 2011.

In October 2018, the Woolwich Ferry was suspended for four months in order to undertake major repair work for the piers, and the existing vessels were taken out of service. The foot tunnel remained open. The ferry service resumed on 1 February 2019.

Following expiry of Briggs Marine&#x27;s contract in December 2020, the service is now run by London River Services. Under TfL-owned London River Services’ stewardship, services on the route have been slashed with operating hours for the ferry reduced to end at 7pm weekdays rather than 10pm. In addition, only one of the two new ferries has been in service since 2020, with TfL citing staffing challenges as the reason for the roughly 70% reduction in capacity.

===Incidents===
On 3 August 2011, 19-year-old ferry worker Ben Woollacott died after falling off the boat into the River Thames. The MAIB report published in August 2012 blamed &quot;unseamanlike working practices&quot; during the unmooring operation for the death. When two new ships were bought to update the service in 2018, one was named after him.

==Fleet==

The first ferries were the side-loading paddle steamers &quot;Gordon&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot; and &quot;Hutton&quot;, named after General Gordon of Khartoum, Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton. Each was powered by a condensing engine manufactured by John Penn and Sons of Greenwich, producing 100 nominal horsepower.

The initial fleet was eventually replaced, starting in 1923 with &quot;The Squire&quot; (named after William Squires, a former mayor of Woolwich), and in 1930 with the &quot;Will Crooks&quot; (Crooks was Labour MP for Woolwich, 1903–21) and the &quot;John Benn&quot; (Benn was a member of the London County Council, Liberal MP for St George—which included Wapping—and grandfather of Tony Benn).

Three vessels were built in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after prominent local politicians: &quot;James Newman&quot; (mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25), &quot;John Burns&quot;, and &quot;Ernest Bevin&quot;. These ferries featured Voith Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller was fitted centrally at either end, each driven by a 500bhp 6-cylinder Mirrlees Blackstone diesel engine. Transport for London introduced an &quot;Art On The River&quot; scheme in 2014, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels. These vessels ceased operation on 5 October 2018, after which service was suspended for four months and the ferries sold for demolition.

Two new vessels, the &quot;Ben Woollacott&quot; and the &quot;Dame Vera Lynn&quot;, were delivered from the Remontowa shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland, to replace the previous fleet in October 2018. The new vessels entered service on 1 February 2019. They have suffered from numerous technical issues resulting in closures and service reductions, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan apologising in November 2019 and stating the new ferries &quot;aren&#x27;t good enough&quot;.

==Passenger numbers==

The ferry typically carries about two million passengers a year; occupants of vehicles (including drivers) are counted as passengers. In 2012 the ferry carried around 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers weekly.

At all times of day, but particularly at peak hours, it is common for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure. Various improvements have been made to the vehicle queueing arrangements over the years, especially to avoid impacting local traffic.

For foot passengers, bus services connect to both terminals. There is a small bus station on the north side, but some cross-river foot passengers take the foot tunnel instead. About 300 foot passengers used the ferry daily between 1983 and 1985. Further competition arrived in 2009 with the extension to Woolwich of the Docklands Light Railway, which crosses under the river to the east of the crossing and the tunnel, and has led to a reduction in the number of foot passengers using the ferry.
==Future==
The ferry service provides one of the few road crossings of the Thames east of the City of London. As long as there is a demand for a vehicle ferry it is unlikely to be discontinued, and doing so would require changing the Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Act 1885.

Planning applications were submitted for a new bridge, the Thames Gateway Bridge, close to the Woolwich Ferry, in 2004 although the project was cancelled in 2008. In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead which was expected to open in 2017. This did not occur and has been replaced with proposals for either a new bridge or tunnel in the area. TfL planning director Richard de Cani has said that the ferry will continue to operate as long as there are no alternatives, and there are no current plans to discontinue the service.

Tolls cannot be levied on the ferry without changing the 1885 Act of Parliament. However, it is possible that the service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects.

==Media appearances==
The Woolwich ferry has made several appearances on TV and film. The &quot;John Benn&quot; is seen being destroyed by the titular monster in the film &quot;Behemoth, the Sea Monster&quot;. A detailed scale model is used to interact with a model of the monster&#x27;s head, which capsizes the ship in the Thames.

<text>The 1992 Paralympic Winter Games () were the fifth Winter Paralympics. They were the first Winter Paralympics to be celebrated with the International Olympic Committee cooperation. They were also the first ever Paralympics or a Winter Parasports event held in France. They were held at the resort of Tignes as a support venue of the main host city Albertville, France, from 25 March to 1 April 1992. For the first time, demonstration events in Alpine and Nordic Skiing for athletes with an intellectual disability and Biathlon for athletes with a visual impairment were held.

== Sports ==
The games consisted of 79 events in three disciplines of two sports.

* Alpine skiing
* Nordic skiing
** Biathlon
** Cross-country skiing

==Medal table==

The top 10 NPCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation (France) is highlighted.
==Participating nations==
Twenty four nations participated in the 1992 Winter Paralympics. Germany became an independent country after their reunification while Soviet Union was in the process of their country&#x27;s dissolution. Estonia, Liechtenstein and South Korea made their debut appearances at the Winter Games.

<doc id="333747" wikidata="Q1141135" url="?curid=333747" title="Wattled crane">
<text>The wattled crane (Grus carunculata) is a large, threatened species of crane found in wetlands and grasslands of eastern and southern Africa, ranging from Ethiopia to South Africa. Some authorities consider it the sole member of the genus Bugeranus.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the wattled crane was by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 under the binomial name &quot;Ardea carunculata&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;wattled heron&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1785. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;caruncula&quot; meaning &quot;a small piece of flesh&quot;.

The wattled crane was formerly placed in its own genus &quot;Bugeranus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus &quot;Grus&quot; within the crane family was not monophyletic and that the wattled crane was a sister species to a clade containing the blue crane and the demoiselle crane. In the resulting reorganization of the genera, the wattled crane was moved to the genus &quot;Grus&quot;. Some taxonomists retain the wattled crane within &quot;Bugeranus&quot;. The wattled crane is monotypic: there are no recognised subspecies.

==Description==

At a height known to range from , it is the largest crane in Africa and is the second tallest species of crane in the world, after the sarus crane. It is also the tallest flying bird native to Africa third only among all birds to the two species of ostrich. The wattled crane is taller and, despite the appearance of gracility imparted by its sharp but slim beak and slender neck and legs, is the heaviest on average of several very large, long-legged waders in Africa (i.e. the 2 largest African storks, shoebill, greater flamingo, goliath heron). It is also roughly the fourth heaviest African flying bird after the great white pelican, the much more sexually dimorphic kori bustard and cape vulture. The wingspan is , the length is typically and weight is in females and in males. Among standard measurements, the wing chord length is , the exposed culmen is and the tarsus is . Going on standard measurements, it is the second largest proportioned crane after the sarus species, outsizing in these respects even the ostentatiously heavier red-crowned crane. Three adult wattled cranes averaged . The back and wings are ashy gray. The feathered portion of the head is dark slate gray above the eyes and on the crown, but is otherwise white, including the wattles, which are almost fully feathered and hang down from under the upper throat. The breast, primaries, secondaries, and tail coverts are black. The secondaries are long and nearly reach the ground. The upper breast and neck are white all the way to the face. The skin in front of the eye extending to the base of the beak and tip of the wattles is red and bare of feathers and covered by small round wart-like bumps. Wattled cranes have long bills and black legs and toes. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, although males tend to be slightly larger. Juveniles have tawny body plumage, lack the bare skin on the face, and have less prominent wattles. The generation length (in years) is 13.

==Range==
The wattled crane occurs in eleven countries in eastern and southern Africa, including an isolated population in the Ethiopia Highlands. More than half of the world&#x27;s wattled cranes occur in Zambia, but the single largest concentration occurs in the Okavango Delta of Botswana.
The wattled crane has been spotted in Uganda for the first time in 2011, seen in the Kibimba Rice region in the eastern side of the country. This sighting brings the total number of bird species in Uganda to 1040.

In April 2018, a new population of Wattled Cranes was discovered in Angola.

==Habitat and diet==
Wattled cranes inhabit fairly inaccessible wetlands under most conditions. It requires shallow marsh-like habitats with a good deal of sedge-based vegetation. All cranes are omnivorous. The principal food of the wattled crane is mainly aquatic eating the tubers and rhizomes of submerged sedges and water lilies. It is one of the more herbivorous of extant cranes. The other primary portion of the diet consists of aquatic insects. They will supplement the diet with snails, amphibians and snakes when the opportunity arises. Roughly 90% of foraging done by this species occurs in shallow waters. They typically forage by digging vigorously with their bill into the muddy soil. On occasion, it will eat grain and grass seed as well, but does so much less often than the other three African crane species.

==Behavior==
There does seem to be some seasonal movements in this crane species, but they are not well-known. Movements seem to be dictated by local water conditions rather than by seasonal temperature variations. During local floods, the number of wattled cranes can increase from almost none to as much as 3,000 individuals. These movements, in pursuit of ideal feeding conditions, seem more opportunistic movement rather than a fixed migration pattern. On the other hand, there has been observed a migration movement from the high to the low plateaus in Mozambique for the species.

Somewhat gregarious outsize of the breeding season, flocks of wattled cranes can often include 10 or more birds, occasionally as many as 89 individuals. The crowned cranes occasionally interact with this species but, given those species largely terrestrial foraging patterns, this is uncommon. Two species are known to associate closely with wattled cranes due to shared habitat and dietary preferences: the antelope known as the lechwe and the spur-winged goose, the latter nonetheless usually being found in slightly deeper waters. There is no data on significant predation on the wattled crane, as its size often insures it from being killed. Jackals may be occasional predators of chicks.

Wattled cranes commence their breeding season around April. Most nest are sloppily crushed impressions of grass along the border of a marsh. They may use an old spur-winged goose nest or make their own. Eggs are laid approximately 3 weeks after the nests are built. The average clutch size of the species is reportedly the smallest of any of the world&#x27;s cranes, with an average of 1.6 eggs. Even if there are two eggs, usually only one chick successfully survives to hatch or fledge. The incubation period, roughly 33 to 36 days, is on average the longest of any crane and both parents participate. The chicks are immediately fed by both parents, which take shifts. After around 80 days, the chick(s) start to forage with their parents. At the first sign of any danger, the parents force their young into tall grasses to hide. The fledging period occurs at 100–150 days, the longest it takes any crane to fledge. The young remain with their parents for up to a year (when the next breeding period starts) and may gather in flocks with unrelated juveniles.

==Threats==
Destruction, alteration, and degradation of wetland habitats constitute the most significant threats to the wattled crane, perhaps one of the most habitat sensitive of all cranes. Hydroelectric power projects and other water development have caused fundamental changes in the species expansive floodplain habitats, and their most important food source &quot;Eleocharis&quot; spp. Human and livestock disturbance, powerline collisions, mass aerial spraying of tsetse flies, and illegal collection of eggs, chicks and adults for food are also significant threats to wattled cranes throughout their range.

The wattled crane is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. It is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.

<text>The National Maritime Museum (NMM) is a maritime museum in Greenwich, London. It is part of Royal Museums Greenwich, a network of museums in the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site. Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, it has no general admission charge; there are admission charges for most side-gallery temporary exhibitions, usually supplemented by many loaned works from other museums.

==Creation and official opening==
The museum was created by the National Maritime Museum Act 1934 under a Board of Trustees, appointed by HM Treasury. It is based on the generous donations of Sir James Caird (1864–1954). King George VI formally opened the museum on 27 April 1937 when his daughter Princess Elizabeth accompanied him for the journey along the Thames from London. The first director was Sir Geoffrey Callender.

Since the earliest times Greenwich has had associations with the sea and navigation. It was a landing place for the Romans, Henry VIII lived here, the Navy has roots on the waterfront, and Charles II founded the Royal Observatory in 1675 for &quot;finding the longitude of places&quot;. The home of Greenwich Mean Time and the Prime Meridian since 1884, Greenwich has long been a centre for astronomical study, while navigators across the world have set their clocks according to its time of day. The museum has the most important holdings in the world on the history of Britain at sea, comprising more than two million items, including maritime art (both British and 17th-century Dutch), cartography, manuscripts including official public records, ship models and plans, scientific and navigational instruments, and instruments for time-keeping and astronomy (based at the Observatory). Its holdings including paintings relating to Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson and Captain James Cook.

An active loans programme ensures that items from the collection are seen in the UK and abroad.

The museum aims to achieve a greater understanding of British economic, cultural, social, political and maritime history and its consequences in the world today. The museum plays host to various exhibitions, including &quot;Ships Clocks &amp; Stars&quot; in 2014, &quot;Samuel Pepys: Plague, Fire, Revolution&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Emma Hamilton: Seduction and Celebrity&quot; in 2016.

The collection of the National Maritime Museum also includes items taken from the German Naval Academy Mürwik after World War II, including several ship models, paintings and flags. The museum has been criticised for possessing what has been described as &quot;looted art&quot;. The museum regards these cultural objects as &quot;war trophies&quot;, removed under the provisions of the Potsdam Conference.

The museum awards the Caird Medal annually in honour of its major donor, Sir James Caird.

In late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions. Eventually, the National Maritime Museum, Titanic Belfast and Titanic Foundation Limited, as well as National Museums Northern Ireland, joined together as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artifacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. The oceanographer Robert Ballard said that he favoured this bid as it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where the &quot;Titanic&quot; was built) and in Greenwich. The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the auction on 11 October 2018 was set at US$21.5 million (£16.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.

==Greenwich site==
The museum was officially established in 1934 within the of Greenwich Royal Park in the buildings formerly occupied by the Royal Hospital School, before it moved to Holbrook in Suffolk.

The gardens immediately to the north of the museum were reinstated in the late 1870s following construction of the cut-and-cover tunnel between Greenwich and Maze Hill stations. The tunnel comprised part of the final section of the London and Greenwich Railway and opened in 1878.

A full redevelopment of the main galleries, centring on what is now the Neptune Court, which was designed by Rick Mather Architects and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, was completed in 1999.

In 2008, the museum announced that the Israeli shipping magnate Sammy Ofer had donated £20m for a new gallery.

Between 2016 and 2017 the National Maritime Museum reported 2.41 million visitors.

A major refurbishment of the main galleries, including replacement of the Neptune Court roof, was undertaken in the early 2020s.

== Prince Philip Maritime Collections Centre ==
The museum has an additional site nearby, the Prince Philip Maritime Collections Centre in Kidbrooke, opened in 2018. This houses approximately 70,000 items from the collection, but is only open to the public on limited occasions, by means of (pre-booked) guided tours.

==Caird Medal==

The Caird Medal was instituted in 1984 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the National Maritime Museum Act 1934 that established the museum. The medal is awarded annually to &quot;an individual who, in the opinion of the Trustees of the National Maritime Museum, has done conspicuously important work in the field of the Museum&#x27;s interests and is of a nature which involves communicating with the public.&quot; The medal is named for Sir James Caird (1864–1954), the principal donor at the founding of the National Maritime Museum.

<doc id="333763" wikidata="Q639666" url="?curid=333763" title="Crieff">
<text>Crieff (; , meaning &quot;tree&quot;) is a Scottish market town in Perth and Kinross on the A85 road between Perth and Crianlarich, and the A822 between Greenloaning and Aberfeldy. The A822 joins the A823 to Dunfermline. Crieff has become a hub for tourism, famous for whisky and its history of cattle droving. Attractions include the Caithness Glass Visitor Centre and Glenturret Distillery. The nearby Innerpeffray Library (founded about 1680) is Scotland&#x27;s oldest lending library. St Mary&#x27;s Chapel beside it dates from 1508. Both are open to the public: the library is run by a charitable trust; the chapel is in the care of Historic Scotland.

==History==
For centuries Highlanders came to Crieff to sell their black cattle, whose meat and hides were sought by the growing urban populations in Lowland Scotland and the north of England. The town acted as a gathering point for the Michaelmas cattle sale held during the &quot;October Tryst&quot; each year, when the surrounding fields and hillsides would be black with some 30,000 cattle, some from as far away as Caithness and the Outer Hebrides.

Rob Roy MacGregor and his followers visited Crieff in October 1714: they gathered in Crieff for the October Tryst. They marched to Crieff Town Square and, in front of the gathering crowd, sang Jacobite songs and drank loyal toasts to their uncrowned King James VIII.

In 1716, 350 Highlanders returning from the Battle of Sheriffmuir burned most of Crieff to the ground. In 1731, James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth, laid out the town&#x27;s central James Square and established a textile industry with a flax factory. In the 1745 rising, the Highlanders were itching to fire the town again and were reported as saying &quot;she shoud be a braw toun gin she haed anither sing&quot;. It was saved by the Duke of Perth, a friend and supporter of Prince Charles. In February 1746, the Jacobite army was quartered in and around the town, with Prince Charles Edward Stuart holding his final war council in the old &quot;Drummond Arms Inn&quot; in James Square, located behind the present abandoned hotel building in Hill Street.

By the late 18th century, the hanging tree used by the Earls of Strathearn to punish criminals had been replaced by a wooden structure in an area called Gallowhaugh, now Gallowhill, at the bottom of Burrell Street. What is now Ford Road was Gallowford Road which led down past the gallows to the crossing point over the River Earn. Sir Walter Scott, visiting Crieff in 1796, saw the gallows as &quot;Gallowsford&quot;.

Crieff Town Hall was completed in 1850. In the 19th century, Crieff became a fashionable destination for tourists visiting the Highlands and a country retreat for wealthy businessmen from Edinburgh, Glasgow and beyond. Many such visitors attended the Crieff hydropathic establishment, now the Crieff Hydro, which opened in 1868. 

Crieff was once served by Crieff railway station, which linked the town to Perth, Comrie and Gleneagles. The station was opened in 1856 by the Crieff Junction Railway but was closed in 1964 by British Railways as part of the Beeching cuts.

==Fame in verse==
Crieff was praised by the poetaster William McGonagall in &quot;Crieff&quot;.
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief,
Take my advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

It is also referenced by Half Man Half Biscuit in &quot;Man of constant sorrow&quot;.
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;A yacht on his window sill, according to some
Alludes to a tragedy which rendered him numb
To cope with the grief and the hurt and the loss
He exited Crieff, Perth and Kinross&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Events==
Every year the town hosts the Crieff Highland Games, which include music and dancing competitions and feats of strength.

==Schools==

==Places of worship==

Crieff Parish Church (Church of Scotland) in Strathearn Terrace, also known as the East Church, is on the site of a medieval building that was demolished and rebuilt in 1786, when a hoard of gold coins from the reign of Robert the Bruce was found within its walls. The church was again rebuilt in 1827.

Crieff West Church (Church of Scotland) was built 1837–1838 on Comrie Road as a chapel of ease to the main parish church. It was converted into the St Ninian&#x27;s Centre in 1958 and used for over 50 years as a lay training and conference venue until its closure in 2001. The building is now occupied by private flats.

The South Church, now disused, was built in 1881 as a Free Church of Scotland, modelled on the design of Dunblane Cathedral. It later became known as the South UP Church when it merged with the United Presbyterian Church (Scotland) into the United Free Church of Scotland, before becoming part of the established Church of Scotland.

The Scottish Episcopal Church in Perth Road is a small 1990s building which replaced an older church.

The Roman Catholic Church is represented by St Fillan&#x27;s Chapel in Ford Road, as part of the Diocese of Dunkeld.

Radio Earn broadcasts from Strathearn and Strathallan.

<doc id="333766" wikidata="Q3821003" url="?curid=333766" title="Westcombe Park">
<text>Westcombe Park is a largely residential area in Blackheath in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, South East London, England. It is bounded by the main London-Dartford railway line to the north, the Blackwall Tunnel southern approach to the east, Blackheath to the south and a road, Vanbrugh Hill, to the west (named after the architect and playwright Sir John Vanbrugh who built his house Vanbrugh Castle nearby in Maze Hill).

Westcombe Park largely comprises the northern half of the Blackheath Westcombe ward of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, which in 2011 had a population of 26,914.

&quot;Westcombe&quot; is a topographical place name, derived from &quot;Combe&quot;, a common old English word for &#x27;valley&#x27;, often formed into a compound name - in this case with the adjective &#x27;West&#x27;.

==Sites of interest==

Much of Westcombe Park lies within the Westcombe Park Conservation Area, designated in 2002. Broadly, this covers an area bounded to the north by the stretch of railway line between Vanbrugh Hill and Westcombe Hill, to the east by the A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach, to the south by Westcombe Park Road, and to the west by Ulundi Road.

===Woodlands House===

Its most notable existing landmark, and only Listed building (grade II), is Woodlands House, in Mycenae Road. This four-storey Georgian villa (architect: George Gibson) still lies in its own grounds and was built between 1774 and 1776 for John Julius Angerstein, a Lloyd&#x27;s underwriter and merchant whose collection of old master paintings was bought for the nation in 1824, following his death, to form the nucleus of the National Gallery, London.

The Angerstein family continued to live in Woodlands House until about 1870. It was later acquired by Sir Alfred Yarrow, a shipbuilder, in 1896.

From about 1923, the house served as a convent; neighbouring Mycenae House (formerly Kidbrooke House) was built in 1933 to provide dormitory space for the Little Sisters of the Assumption convent. Woodlands was then acquired by the London Borough of Greenwich in 1967 and opened as a Local History Library and Art Gallery (Woodlands Art Gallery) in 1972, while Mycenae House continues to serve as a community centre. Woodlands was leased by the London Borough of Greenwich in November 2007 to The Greenwich Steiner school.

===Westcombe Manor===

To the west of Woodlands House was Westcombe Manor, former family seat of the Ballards, the Lambardes, and Sir Theophilus Biddulph (1612–1683; see also Biddulph baronets). The original house was rebuilt in 1723 by Sir Gregory Page, and let to tenants who included Lavinia Fenton, Dowager Duchess of Bolton, who died at the house in 1760 (Peachum Road is named after a role, Polly Peachum, played by Fenton as an actress). In 1796, the building was described in Daniel Lysons&#x27; &quot;Environs of London&quot;:

:&quot;West-Combe-park, the site of this manor, was granted by Sir Gregory Page on a long lease to Captain Galfridus Walpole, (younger brother of Sir Robert, and uncle of the present Earl of Orford) who built the present house. The lease of West-Combepark afterwards came into the possession of Charles, third Duke of Bolton, who resided there for several years with Lavinia Fenton, the celebrated Polly Peachem, whom he married on the decease of his Duchess. The Duke died in 1754; Lavinia Duchess of Bolton in 1760, when West-Combe-park became the property of her son, the Rev. Mr. Powlett, in whom the remainder of the lease (which expires in 1824) is now vested. Since the Duchess&#x27;s death WestCombe has been in the successive occupation of Lord Clive, the Marquis of Lothian, his widow the Marchioness, the Duchess of Athol, Mr. Halliday the banker, and William Petrie, Esq. It is now the residence of William Holmes, Esq. who has the remainder of an under lease granted to Mr. Halliday. West-Combe-house is situated on the verge of a steep hill, agreeably diversified with plantations, and commanding a fine view of the river.&quot;

It was later, from 1827, leased as the home of Deptford shipbuilder, shipowner and timber merchant Thomas Brockelbank (co-founder of the General Steam Navigation Company), after whose death, on 10 June 1843, it was eventually demolished in 1855.

===St George&#x27;s Church===
St George&#x27;s Church (on a sloping site on the corner of Kirkside Road and Glenluce Road) is a Victorian red-brick structure completed in 1892 (architect: Newman &amp; Newman). As well as a place of worship it is also home to a Rudolf Steiner or Waldorf School-style nursery school.

===Other===
In the early 2000s, Westcombe Park was used as a location by the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The footbridge from which Andy Hunter, played by Michael Higgs, was pushed to his death is easily identifiable as the bridge (over the A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach) that runs from Farmdale Road to Westcombe Park railway station.

==Amenities==

===Shops===
At the foot of Westcombe Hill, there is a newsagent and a hairdresser&#x27;s shop.

At the top of Westcombe Hill, the &quot;Blackheath Standard&quot; or &quot;Standard&quot; area has numerous shops including a Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Simply Food&quot; outlet, a fish and chip shop, a children&#x27;s toy shop, estate agents, a cake shop, cafes, hairdressers, a Chinese restaurant and take-away, newsagents, a greengrocer, a butcher, and a DIY shop. There is also a library and a post office. The library is equipped with wi-fi Internet access and has a range of music and video DVDs as well as books and journals.

===Parks===

There is a small park in the centre of the Standard. It was originally a village green, known during the 18th century as Sheepgate Green, marking the intersection of four major roads. In the late 1880s, local philanthropist William Fox Batley and other local dignitaries, including the Rev John William Marshall, vicar of the nearby church of St John the Evangelist, began to campaign for local improvements. Batley&#x27;s contribution is recorded in an inscription on a memorial fountain, unveiled in May 1889, and he is also commemorated by a stained glass window in the church. The central area was surrounded by railings and planted with new trees and shrubs, and new public lavatories were constructed from 1905 to 1907, and it became known as Batley Green or Batley Park, sometimes wrongly called Bartley Park.

===Public houses===
There are two public house in the Westcombe Park area - the Royal Standard (from which the Standard area takes its name) on the corner of Vanbrugh Park and Stratheden Road - and The Green Goddess, which opened in July 2022 in a former bank building immediately opposite the Royal Standard. There are four others nearby: the Angerstein Hotel and The River Ale House on Woolwich Road to the north, the Vanbrugh Tavern (closed as of July 2022) on Colomb Street to the west, and the British Oak on Old Dover Road to the southeast. There are also two licensed restaurants on Station Crescent, near Westcombe Park station, and a licensed bar in Mycenae House.

===Healthcare===
There are several dental and general practitioner surgeries around the Standard. Since the 2001 closure and later demolition of Greenwich District Hospital, situated at the northern end of Maze Hill, the nearest hospital is the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London.

Blackheath also has a notable number of &#x27;alternative&#x27; health practitioners, e.g.: acupuncture, homeopathy, hypnosis, chiropracty and crystal healing.

===Sport===
Various sporting events take place in or close to Westcombe Park. Rectory Field, formerly the home of Blackheath rugby club, is located to the east. To the west, Greenwich Park hosts cricket matches and has tennis courts; to the southwest, Blackheath common is used for cricket and football; both park and common are popular with joggers and walkers. The London Marathon (which starts on Blackheath common) and (from 2008 to 2013) the Run to the Beat half marathon routes both took runners though the Westcombe Park area each year.

Westcombe Park rugby club was originally formed in Westcombe Park in 1904. Having since played on fields in Lee, Shooter&#x27;s Hill and Sidcup, it currently operates from a sports ground in Orpington.

<doc id="333768" wikidata="Q1858105" url="?curid=333768" title="Parliament House, Canberra">
<text>Parliament House, also known as Capital Hill, is the meeting place of the Parliament of Australia, the legislative body of Australia&#x27;s federal system of government. The building also houses the core of the executive (the Australian Government), containing the Cabinet room and offices of the Prime Minister and other federal ministers.

Located in Canberra, Parliament House is situated on the southern apex of the National Triangle atop Capital Hill, at the intersection of Commonwealth, Adelaide, Canberra and Kings Avenues enclosed by the State Circle.

Parliament House was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola &amp; Thorp Architects and constructed by a joint venture comprising Concrete Constructions and John Holland. The building replaced Old Parliament House, where the Federal Parliament sat from 1927 until 1988, when members and their staff moved &quot;up the hill&quot; to the so-named New Parliament House. The current Parliament House was officially opened on 1988 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. It cost more than $1.1 billion (equivalent to about $ billion in ) to build.

== History ==

=== Before the establishment of Canberra ===

In 1901, when the six British colonies in Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia, Melbourne and Sydney were the two largest cities in the country, but the long history of rivalry between them meant that neither city would accept the other as the national capital. However a compromise was reached and implemented in section 125 of the Australian Constitution, whereby the capital would be in a federal territory located in NSW; however it had to be located at least 100 miles from Sydney. The Parliament would sit in Melbourne until the new capital was completed.

In 1909, after much argument, the Parliament decided that the new capital would be in the southern part of New South Wales, on the site which is now Canberra. The Commonwealth acquired control over the land in 1911, but World War I intervened, and nothing was done for some years to build the city. Federal Parliament did not leave Melbourne until 1927.

In the meantime the Australian Parliament met in the 19th-century edifice of Parliament House, Melbourne, while the Victorian State Parliament met in the nearby Royal Exhibition Building for 26 years.

===Old Parliament House===

After World War I the Federal Capital Advisory Committee was established to prepare Canberra to be the seat of government, including the construction of a Parliament House. The committee decided that it would be best to erect a provisional building, to serve for a predicted 50 years until a new, permanent House could be built. In the end, Old Parliament House was Parliament&#x27;s home for 61 years. In the last decade of its use as a parliament, the building had a chronic shortage of available space.
===Design and construction===
In Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s original design for Canberra, Parliament House would be located on Camp Hill, located between Old Parliament House and Capital Hill. Instead a &quot;Capitol&quot; building would be placed on Capital Hill, that would hold the national archives and act as a public assembly. Placing Parliament beneath the Capitol building would then represent the people standing above their representatives. Debate over the site continued over the years, with Menzies in 1958 supporting a site on the shore of the lake. However, there remained support for the Capital Hill site, which culminated in the passage of the &quot;Parliament Act 1974&quot; with a free vote, which determined that the Capital Hill site should be used. 

In 1978 the Fraser government decided to proceed with a new building on Capital Hill, and the Parliament House Construction Authority was created. A two-stage competition was announced, for which the Authority consulted the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and, together with the National Capital Development Commission, made available to competitors a brief and competition documents. The design competition drew 329 entries from 29 countries.

The competition winner was the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work directed by the Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola, with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The facades, however, included deliberate imitation of some of the patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there is a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale.

Giurgola placed an emphasis on the visual aesthetics of the building by using landscape architect Peter G Rolland to direct civil engineers, a reversal of the traditional roles in Australia. Rolland played a pivotal role in the design, development and coordination of all surface elements including pool design, paving, conceptual lighting and artwork locations. Horticultural experts from the Australian National Botanic Gardens and a government nursery were consulted on plant selection. Permanent irrigation has been limited to only the more formal areas. Irwinconsult was commissioned to provide structural engineering, including quality assurance of all structural elements, to deliver a building with a designed lifespan of 200 years.

Construction began in 1981, and the House was intended to be ready by Australia Day, 1988, the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. It was expected to cost $220 million. Neither the deadline nor the budget was met.
The building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1988, the anniversary of the opening of both the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne on 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V), and of Provisional Parliament House in Canberra on 1927 by the Duke of York (later King George VI).

The flag flown from the flagpole is , about the size of half a tennis court. The flagpole weighs 250 tonnes and is made of polished stainless steel from Newcastle, with the steel ball resting at the top of the flagpole manufactured by Leussink Engineering Pty Ltd. It was designed to be the pinnacle of Parliament House and is an easily recognisable symbol of national government. It is visible by day from outside and inside Parliament House and floodlit at night. The flag itself weighs approximately .

The site covers . The building was designed to sit above Old Parliament House when seen from a distance. The building is four metres (13 feet) higher than the original height of the hill. About one million cubic metres (35,000,000 cubic feet) of rock had to be excavated from the site. It was used to fill low-lying areas in the city. Most of the granite used was sourced from Australia. Twice the amount needed was quarried as a very high standard of granite was required particularly for the curved walls.

It was proposed originally to demolish Old Parliament House so that there would be an uninterrupted vista from the New Parliament House to Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial, but there were successful representations for the preservation of the historic building, which now houses a parliamentary museum. The original idea was for Parliament House to be open free to the public, and the sweeping lawns leading up to the entrances were intended to symbolise this.

== External features ==
The design of Parliament House is anchored around two large curved walls that divides the structure into four quadrants. Clockwise these are: the formal entrance and event space, the House of Representatives, the executive wing and the Senate. These walls are sunken into the hill so that the building appears to emerge from the land, rather that towering over those beneath it. The ability for people to walk on the grass roofs over their representatives also represents the people being above the government. The entire structure is surmounted by an flagpole flying the Australian flag. The flag is the largest in the country, measuring by around the size of a double-decker bus.

== Layout ==
The Parliament House contains 4,700 rooms, and many areas are open to the public. The main foyer contains a marble staircase and leads to the Great Hall, which has a large tapestry on display based on the Arthur Boyd painting &quot;Untitled (Shoalhaven Landscape)&quot;. The House of Representatives chamber is decorated green, while the Senate chamber has a red colour scheme. At the centre of the building between the two chambers is the Members&#x27; Hall, which has a water feature directly beneath a glass roof and the large central flag. The public may not access the hall, but may view it from above on a balcony. The executive wing houses the cabinet room, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and other ministerial offices.

=== Forecourt ===
Visitors enter Parliament House through the forecourt, surrounded on each side by a slowly rising wall and approaching the entrance which mirrors that of Old Parliament House, despite the massive increase in scale. The gravel of sunburnt red and the green fountain represents the outback, the bush and the billabong, all symbolic of Australia. This and a large mosaic, &quot;Possum and Wallaby Dreaming&quot;, emphasises the enduring Aboriginal connection to the land. The mosaic is forecourt mosaic and was designed by Indigenous Australian artist Michael Nelson Jagamarra. It depicts the tracks of several native animals (in white) moving towards the central circle, representing that Canberra is a gathering place. The style is reminiscent of the traditional sand paintings of the artists tribe, located near Papunya. Three stonemasons took 18 months to two years to hand-cut the 90,000 granite setts which were used in the artwork. The mosaic was digitised in April 2019 from a series of photographs taken from five metres above the artwork.

=== Foyer ===
The main entrance opens into the foyer, the most monumental and luxuriously decorated space in the building. As this is the primary public space in the building, this again represents the greater importance of the people as compared to their representatives. The floor is of polished black and white marble, in which on one step a fossilised ancient prawn can be seen. In contrast to the expanse of the forecourt, the foyer is filled with grey-green columns, the colour of gum trees. These are inspired by various column supported temples, such as the Hypostyle Hall of the Great Temple of Ammon, Karnak and the Hall of the Hundred Columns in the Palace of Persepolis. The columns also provides a reference point to visitors, with the columns acting as a human size natural gathering point. To the left and right are two enormous staircases facing each other, modelled on the those of the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice. Collectively, these ancient European styles represent the influence on European culture in Australia and specifically the ancient Greek and Roman notions of democracy.

Around the room are 20 timber marquetry panels depicting Australian flora and fauna, once again proving a link to the land. Six of the panels depicts the animal, flower and bird emblems of each of the states, a concept that evolved from a previous proposal to depict the coats of arms of the states. Other panels shows plants used by Aboriginal people and those important to early settlers 

=== Great Hall ===
The public entrance to Parliament House opens into the main foyer leading into the Great Hall, which represents the period of early European settlement. The rich marble of the foyer is replaced with soft woods; the cramped columns become a vast open space filled with light. The end of the hall features a tapestry based on a painting by Arthur Boyd, the original of which is also displayed in the building. Once again, this tapestry does not depict any people, but emphasises the importance of land and place. On the eastern wall of the gallery of the great hall is an embroidery, designed by Kay Lawrence, measuring 15 m long and 65 cm high. This is a similar size to the Bayeux Tapestry, which despite its name is also an embroidery. It depicts early Australian history through changes to the landscape with the arrival of settlers. It was created by thousands of ordinary embroiderers who each worked on small sections of the work, to be later created into a whole. 

Functions that have parliamentary and federal relevance often take place here, but the Great Hall is also open to functions for the general public, such as weddings, and the nearby University of Canberra hosts graduation ceremonies here.

=== Members&#x27; Hall ===
Below the tapestry of the Great Hall is a removable division that opens onto the Members&#x27; Hall, which has a water feature at its centre. This is an area restricted to security-classified occupants of the building and special visitors. Directly ahead of the Members&#x27; Hall is the Ministerial Wing, housing the office suites of the Prime Minister and government ministers. The Members&#x27; Hall has access to the House of Representatives and the Senate buildings to the left and right of the main entrance to the halls respectively. Public access to the visitors&#x27; galleries and the Main Committee Room is via an upper level reached by marble staircases ascending from the entrance foyer. There are also 19 committee rooms that are open to the public and a highly secure Cabinet Room on the ground floor.

=== House of Representatives ===

In a reflection of the colour scheme of the British House of Commons, the House of Representatives is decorated in green. However, the colour is muted to suggest the colour of eucalyptus leaves, or the Australian bush.

The chamber itself is designed to seat up to 172 members, with room to accommodate a total of 240 with temporary seating. From the perspective of the image, the press gallery is ahead, with public galleries containing 388 seats to the left and right. Soundproofed galleries for school groups are directly above these, as no talking is permitted when the House members are present.

Frontbench (Cabinet) members approach the table with the ornate box (pictured), known as the despatch box, to speak. Backbenchers have a microphone on their desk and merely stand to speak (unless they cannot stand), in accordance with standing order 60.

The table contains a row of books containing laws the Parliament has passed. Also on the table are copies of the standing orders, dictionaries, &quot;House of Representatives Practice&quot; and Hansard. The clerk and deputy clerk sit in front of the speaker and are responsible for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures one minute. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring throughout the building. All of the almost 2600 clocks in the building will flash green for a vote in the House and red for a vote in the senate while ringing for four minutes to give all members throughout the building time to get to the chamber. After the hourglass stops, the House&#x27;s attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there are successive divisions, and there is no debate after the first division, the middle one-minute hourglasses are turned and the bells are rung for one minute.

As is the custom with Westminster parliaments, members of the governing party sit to the Speaker&#x27;s right, and the Opposition sits to the Speaker&#x27;s left. Independents and minor parties sit between them. The long benches (the front benches) closest to the despatch boxes are reserved for the Cabinet on the government&#x27;s side and the Shadow Cabinet on the Opposition&#x27;s side. Uniquely amongst other national Westminster system parliaments, the prime minister and opposition leader (or most senior present government and opposition member respectively) sit separately at the central table, facing each other.

=== Senate ===

The Senate chamber matches the colour scheme of the House of Lords, decorated in red, but muted to tints of ochre, suggesting the earth and the colours of the outback.
There currently 76 senators, however the chamber was designed to accommodate 120 senators. The gallery arrangement is almost identical to that of the House of Representatives. Unlike the House of Representatives, only the leader of the government or opposition in the Senate approaches the lectern; other frontbench senators and all backbench senators have a desk microphone. As can be seen from the illustrations, unlike the House of Representatives, there is no distinction between the front and back benches in the Senate chamber; Senate ministers and their opposition counterparts have the same two-seat benches as all other senators. The press gallery is located above the Senate chamber. The presiding officer of the Australian Senate is the president of the Senate, who occupies a position in the Senate chamber similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Behind the seat of the President of the Senate are two large seats which are used during the opening of parliament. The larger is the vice-regal chair, used by the governor-general during the opening of Parliament, with the smaller used by distinguished guests, such as foreign leaders.

The &quot;Parliament House Art Collection&quot; of over 6,000 works includes commissioned (and purchased) portraits of every prime minister, governor-general, president of the senate and speaker of the house, as well as other works of art significant to Australia.

=== Basement ===
Beneath Parliament House there is a web of basements and offices. Originally a bomb shelter was included in the design of the House, but it was not built due to cost reasons. It was intended that a large room in the basement would be converted into a bomb shelter, but this has not been built either. 

== Reception ==
New Parliament House has been warmly received for its beauty and democratic symbolism, particularly the grass-covered roof that allows visitor access. Member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh has praised the way &quot;the building was constructed to emerge out of Capitol Hill – rather than sitting atop it as an imposing structure&quot;. The new Parliament House is recognised as being more spacious and light-filled than its predecessor, and much less cramped.

The building has received criticism for the way in which its design discourages collegiality amongst members. New Parliament House was designed in the late 1970s, in the context of the Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing and the tense political climate following the Dismissal of the Whitlam government, and thus one of the key elements of the design brief was providing security for the executive. The winning design&#x27;s solution was to fence off the executive in its own ministerial wing. In practice, this meant it was no longer possible for backbenchers to bump into ministers while passing through the corridors of parliament, increasing a sense of detachment between the two groups. The heart of Old Parliament House was King&#x27;s Hall, an entrance hall open to the public that connected the House of Representatives and the Senate to the parliamentary library and the refreshment rooms. Inevitably, due to its central location, Kings Hall became a bustling hub where people met and talked, and a place where politicians could mingle with the public and the press gallery. In contrast, the new building situates the library and refreshment rooms at great distance from the two chambers, and Member&#x27;s Hall, the foyer that connects the House and the Senate, is not open to the public. As a consequence, Member&#x27;s Hall lies empty, as parliamentarians have no reason to be there.

Similarly, while in the Old Parliament House members of various political parties would inhabit offices that shared the same corridors, New Parliament House segregates opposing parties in different corners of the building, decreasing interaction between members. Members would often only meet their opponents in the adversarial environment of the debating chamber, and many former parliamentarians believe this has heightened the sectarian nature of parliamentary politics in Australia.

Don Watson, speech-writer for former Prime Minister Paul Keating, writes: 
Paul Keating has lamented walking the corridors of New Parliament House &quot;not feeling like you were part of anything&quot;. Another former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, expressed concern the &quot;badly designed&quot; structure lacks &quot;collision space [that] brings people together to... compromise and agree and discuss. I think the design of the building definitely contributes to the fact that there are less cross-party friendships than there were in the old parliament&quot;. These concerns have been echoed by many former parliamentarians, including Malcolm Fraser, Tom Uren, Peter Walsh, Barry Jones, and Bob Carr. Walsh, a former finance minister in the Hawke government has said the building is &quot;an antiseptic, isolated and impersonal place, compared with its predecessor&quot;.

== Function events ==
The new Parliament House is a central hub for events in Canberra, hosting many of the nation&#x27;s largest and most important function events. The Parliament House is a place for meetings, conferences (government, and private), celebrations, and other miscellaneous uses. The Parliament House is one of the few parliament houses in the world where private events are permitted. The Parliament House has 14 event spaces that can be used for special events.

==Solar power project==
In 2011, the Department of Parliamentary Services commissioned a pilot 43.3 kW photovoltaic system on the roof of Parliament House in Canberra. The system is split between two locations, with 192 panels installed on the Senate wing with the remaining 42 panels on the roof of the Gardeners&#x27; Compound. At the time of construction, the system was one of the largest installed for solar power in Australia.

According to the Department of Parliamentary Services, the system was switched on in June 2011 and has performed as expected by providing enough power for lighting in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This equates to an approximate saving of $9,000 which is expected to rise to $17,000 annually.

The system received an award from the Clean Energy Council in 2012 for &quot;Best design and installation of a grid-connect power system greater than 10 kW&quot;.

== Engineering heritage award ==
Both the old and new Parliament House received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

==Criminal acts==
There have been repeated allegations of criminal acts committed in the Australian Parliament house; these included the 2021 Australian Parliament House sexual misconduct allegations involving Brittany Higgins, Bruce Lehrmann and Christian Porter. In 1992, a vehicle was driven through the glass front doors into the Great Hall In 2024, Australian Federal Police allowed people to climb the building and protest.

<doc id="333772" wikidata="Q131950" url="?curid=333772" title="Paenungulata">
<text>Paenungulata (from Latin &quot;paene&quot; &quot;almost&quot; + &quot;ungulātus&quot; &quot;having hoofs&quot;) is a clade of &quot;sub-ungulates&quot;, which groups three extant mammal orders: Proboscidea (including elephants), Sirenia (sea cows, including dugongs and manatees), and Hyracoidea (hyraxes). At least two more possible orders are known only as fossils, namely Embrithopoda and Desmostylia.

Molecular evidence indicates that Paenungulata (or at least its extant members) is part of the cohort Afrotheria, an ancient assemblage of mainly African mammals of great diversity. The other members of this cohort are the orders Afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews) and Tubulidentata (aardvarks).

Of the five orders, hyraxes are the most basal, followed by embrithopods; the remaining orders (sirenians and elephants) are more closely related. These latter three are grouped as the [[Tethytheria]], because it is believed that their common ancestors lived on the shores of the prehistoric Tethys Sea; however, recent myoglobin studies indicate that even Hyracoidea had an aquatic ancestor.

== History ==
In 1945, George Gaylord Simpson used traditional taxonomic techniques to group these spectacularly diverse mammals in the superorder he named Paenungulata (&quot;almost ungulates&quot;), but there were many loose threads in unravelling their genealogy. For example, hyraxes in his Paenungulata had some characteristics suggesting they might be connected to the Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates, such as horses and rhinos). Indeed, early taxonomists placed the Hyracoidea closest to the rhinoceroses because of their dentition.

When genetic techniques were developed for inspecting amino acid differences among haemoglobin sequences the most parsimonious cladograms depicted Simpson&#x27;s Paenungulata as an authentic clade and as one of the first groups to diversify from the basal placental mammals (Eutheria). The amino acid sequences reject a connection between extant paenungulates and perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates).

However, a 2014 cladistic analysis placed anthracobunids and desmostylians, two major extinct groups that have been considered to be non-African afrotheres, close to each other within Perissodactyla.

==Extinct orders==
Each of the extinct orders, the Embrithopoda and Desmostylia, was as unique in its members&#x27; ways of making a living as the three orders that survive. Embrithopods were rhinoceros-like herbivorous mammals with plantigrade feet, and desmostylians were hippopotamus-like amphibious animals. Their walking posture and diet have been the subject of speculation, but tooth wear indicates that desmostylians browsed on terrestrial plants and had a posture similar to other large hoofed mammals.

<doc id="333778" wikidata="Q1326038" url="?curid=333778" title="Order of St Patrick">
<text>The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick is a dormant British order of chivalry associated with Ireland. The Order was created in 1783 by King George III at the request of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the 3rd Earl Temple (later created Marquess of Buckingham). The regular creation of knights of the Order lasted until 1922, when most of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, a dominion within what was then known as the British Commonwealth of Nations. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, died in 1974. Charles III, however, remains the Sovereign of the Order, and one officer, the Ulster King of Arms (now represented in the office of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms), also survives. Saint Patrick is patron of the order; its motto is &quot;Quis separabit?&quot;, Latin for &quot;Who will separate [us]?&quot;: an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8:35, &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&quot;

Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire United Kingdom, but each of the three most senior ones pertains to one constituent country only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in England, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the British Isles, dating from the mid-fourteenth century. The Scottish equivalent is the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, dating in its present form from 1687.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The order was founded in 1783, a year after the grant of substantial autonomy to Ireland, as a means of rewarding (or obtaining) political support in the Irish Parliament. The Order of the Bath, founded in 1725, was instituted for similar reasons. The statutes of the Order restricted membership to men who were both knights and gentlemen, the latter being defined as having three generations of &quot;noblesse&quot; (meaning ancestors bearing coats of arms) on both their father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s side. In practice, however, only Irish peers and British princes were ever appointed to the Order. The cross of St Patrick (a red saltire on a white background) was chosen as one of the symbols of the Order. A flag of this design was later incorporated into the Union Flag. Its association with Saint Patrick or with Ireland prior to the foundation of the Order is unclear, however. One of the first knights was the William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster, whose arms carry the same cross.

=== After 1922 ===

The last non-royal member appointed to the Order was James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922, who served as the first Governor of Northern Ireland. When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom in December of that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to the Order.

Since then, only three people have been appointed to the Order, all members of the British Royal Family. The then-Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor) was appointed in 1927 and his younger brothers, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1934 and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), in 1936.

The Constitution of Ireland of 1937 provides that &quot;Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State&quot; (Article 40.2.1°) and &quot;No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government&quot; (Article 40.2.2°). Legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits the awarding of membership of the Order of St Patrick to Irish citizens, but some suggest that the phrase &quot;titles of nobility&quot; implies hereditary peerages and other noble titles, not lifetime honours such as knighthoods. This argument does not address the words &quot;or of honour&quot; however.

The last living non-royal recipient, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, died in 1961. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, at his death in 1974, was the last surviving knight. As of 2016, the Order was considered technically extant with its head Queen Elizabeth II and one officer, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms.

=== Possible revival ===
Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested reviving the Order in 1943 to recognise the services in North Africa of General Sir Harold Alexander, a member of an Ulster Scots family from County Tyrone, but the opinion of the other ministers and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin. Taoiseach Seán Lemass considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did not take a decision.

== Composition ==

=== Members ===
The British monarch is the Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch&#x27;s representative in Ireland, served as the Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Initially, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order as a matter of right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the exception rather than the rule. In 1839, Queen Victoria altered this and, though not a member during his Grand Mastership, he was permitted to retain the insignia after his term of office.

The Order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to the Sovereign. In 1821, however, George IV appointed six additional knights; he did not issue a Royal Warrant authorising the change until 1830. William IV formally changed the statutes in 1833, increasing the limit to twenty-two knights.

The original statutes, based heavily on those of the Order of the Garter, prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the sovereign upon the nomination of the members. Each knight was to propose nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of earl or higher, three the rank of baron or higher, and three the rank of knight or higher, and a vote taken. In practice this system was never used; the grand master would nominate a peer, the Sovereign would usually assent, and a chapter meeting was held at which the knights &quot;elected&quot; the new member. The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts, the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle, in only ever appointing peers and princes. Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick; they were not eligible to become members of the other two orders until 1987. The only woman to be part of the Order was Queen Victoria, in her capacity as Sovereign of the Order. Although it was associated with the established Church of Ireland until 1871, several Catholics were appointed to the order throughout its history.

=== Officers ===

The Order of St Patrick initially had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the King of Arms, two heralds and four pursuivants. Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the Church of Ireland, then the established church. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics were allowed to remain in office until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials. All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant.

The office of Prelate was held by the Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland. The Prelate was not mentioned in the original statutes, but was created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the then Archbishop asked to be appointed to the post. Since the death of the last holder in 1885, the office has remained vacant.

The Church of Ireland&#x27;s second highest cleric, the Archbishop of Dublin, originally served as the Chancellor of the Order. From 1886 onwards, the office was held by the Chief Secretary for Ireland. Since the abolition of the position of Chief Secretary in 1922, the office of Chancellor has remained vacant.
The Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was originally the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, on the death of the Dean who had held the post at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order. This position was held by Ulster King of Arms, Ireland&#x27;s chief heraldic official, a post which had been created in 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the partition of Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The position, insofar as it related to Northern Ireland, was combined with that of Norroy King of Arms (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of Ulster King of Arms, insofar as it related to the Irish Free State (now officially called Ireland), became the position of Chief Herald of Ireland.

The Order had six other heraldic officers, many more than any other British order. The two heralds were known as Cork and Dublin Heralds. Three of the four pursuivants were untitled, the fourth was held by Athlone Pursuivant, founded in 1552.

The Usher of the Order was &quot;the Usher at Arms named the Black Rod&quot;. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland was distinct from the English officer of the same name, though like his counterpart he had some duties in the Irish House of Lords.

The offices of Secretary and Genealogist were originally held by members of the Irish House of Commons. The office of Secretary has been vacant since 1926. The position of Genealogist was left vacant in 1885, restored in 1889, but left vacant again in 1930.

== Vestments and accoutrements ==
For important occasions, such as Coronations and investitures of new members of the Order, Knights of St Patrick wore elaborate vestments:
* The &quot;mantle&quot; was a celestial blue robe lined with white silk. The star of the Order (see below) was depicted on the left of the mantle. A blue hood was attached to the mantle.
* The &quot;hat&quot; of the Order was originally of white satin, lined with blue, but was changed to black velvet by George IV. It was plumed with three falls of feathers, one red, one white and one blue.
* The &quot;collar&quot; was made of gold, consisting of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately enamelled white within red, and red within white. The central harp, from which the badge of the Order was suspended, was surmounted by a crown.

Aside from these special occasions, much simpler accoutrements were used:
* The &quot;star&quot; of the Order was an eight-pointed figure, with the four cardinal points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays. In the centre was the same motto, year and design that appeared on the badge. The star was worn pinned to the left breast.
* The &quot;broad riband&quot; was a celestial blue sash worn across the body, from the right shoulder to the left hip. The sash of the Order of the Garter, darker in colour, is worn from the left shoulder.
* The &quot;badge&quot; was pinned to the riband at the left hip. Made of gold, it depicted a shamrock bearing three crowns, on top of a cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majuscules, as well as the date of the Order&#x27;s foundation in Roman numerals (&quot;MDCCLXXXIII&quot;).

The Grand Master&#x27;s insignia were of the same form and design as those of the Knights. In 1831, however, William IV presented the Grand Master with a star and badge, each composed of rubies, emeralds and Brazilian diamonds. These two insignia were designated &quot;Crown Jewels&quot; in the Order&#x27;s 1905 Statutes, and the designation &quot;Irish Crown Jewels&quot; was emphasised by newspapers when they were stolen in 1907, along with the collars of five Knights; they have not since been recovered.

A number of items pertaining to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The robes of Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock, the 122nd Knight of the Order, are on display in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin; the robe belonging to Francis Charles Needham, 3rd Earl of Kilmorey is held by the Newry Museum; the National Gallery of Ireland and Genealogical Museum in Dublin both have Stars of the Order; and the Ulster Museum (part of the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland) in Stranmillis has a large collection on display and two mantles in storage. The Irish Guards take their capstar and motto from the Order.

== Chapel and Chancery ==


The Chapel of the Order was originally in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in central Dublin. Each member of the Order, including the sovereign, was allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel, above which his (or her, in the case of Queen Victoria) heraldic devices were displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight&#x27;s stall was a helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. Above the crest, the knight&#x27;s heraldic banner was hung, emblazoned with his coat of arms. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall was affixed a piece of brass (a &quot;stall plate&quot;) displaying its occupant&#x27;s name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner and crest were taken down and replaced with those of his successor. After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Chapel ceased to be used; the heraldic devices of the knights at the time were left in place at the request of Queen Victoria.

The Order was without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners, helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, in the absence of stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall, in Dublin Castle. On the establishment of the Irish Free State, the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners of the members of the Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick&#x27;s Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick&#x27;s Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the president of Ireland.

Unlike many of the other British orders, the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a continuous record of the knights of the order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871 (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940) and 40 hatchment plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the stall plates, this was perhaps due to their size, .

== Precedence and privileges ==

Since the members of the Order were required to be knights, and in practice had higher rank, many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot. As knights, they could prefix &quot;Sir&quot; to their forenames, but the form was never used in speech, as they were referred to by their peerage dignities. They were assigned positions in the order of precedence, but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities.

Knights used the post-nominal letters &quot;KP&quot;. When an individual was entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, KP appeared before all others, except &quot;Bt&quot; and &quot;Btss&quot; (Baronet and Baronetess), &quot;VC&quot; (Victoria Cross), &quot;GC&quot; (George Cross), &quot;KG&quot; (Knight Companion of the Garter) and &quot;KT&quot; (Knight of the Thistle).

Knights could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a blue circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. They were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. This high privilege was, and is, only shared by members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders. (Of course, Knights of St Patrick, normally all being members of the British Royal Family or peers, were mostly entitled to supporters in any event.)

<text>De Blauwe Aanslag was a squat and self-managed social centre in the Dutch city of The Hague. The oldest part of the building was built in 1886. The large building formerly housed tax offices and was occupied in 1980. When the local council took over the ownership of the building, it was agreed to renovate it in three stages, with the squatters living there. However the plans changed and since 1995 the council decided to widen the roads next to the building; for this reason the squat needed to be demolished. After many efforts to block the demolition with lawsuits, the squatters were evicted by military police on 3 October 2003.

==Occupation==
With the Dutch squatters movement regularly in the news for events such as the Vondelstraat eviction resistance and the Amsterdam coronation riots, De Blauwe Aanslag was occupied in 1980. The owner, the Dutch state, tried to evict the squatters by turning off the electricity but eventually sold the building to the Hague council. At first, the council was more conciliatory in approach and in 1986 agreed with the squatters that the building should be protected. However, by the mid1990s, the council had decided that the building needed to be demolished in order to widen the road at its front, the Buitenom.

==Name==
In English, the name De Blauwe Aanslag means &#x27;The Blue Bill&#x27; and refers to the blue envelopes in which the Dutch tax administration sends its mail, since the building was formerly a tax office.

==Activities==
De Blauwe Aanslag housed 200 people. The building contained a cinema, a concert venue and a restaurant.

A magazine called de Schijnbeweging was published from the building. It was the first home of Radio Tonka, an ongoing free radio project. The Bunker record label came out of parties at De Blauwe Aanslag, releasing artists like Legowelt and Unit Moebius.

==Eviction==
De Blauwe Aanslag was evicted on 3 October 2003, with an operation of 450 riot police. Ninety people were arrested.

After the final legal challenges failed when the permissions for the eviction and demolition orders were judged to be in order, two police water cannons were used to force the squatters on the roof to go back inside. Then a shipping container full of police was lifted to the roof with a crane, so that they could gain entry to the building. Later a JCB was driven into a side entrance in order to gain access at ground level.

==De Grote Pyr==
Some inhabitants of De Blauwe Aanslag and some friends of theirs were offered the opportunity by the Hague council to buy an old school on Waldeck Pyrmontkade and renovate it. This then became De Grote Pyr.

==Recent developments==
In 2013, ten years after De Blauwe Aanslag had been evicted and demolished, Joris Wijsmuller from the Haagse Stadspartij (a political party in the Hague) asked the council why the ground had still not been built on. He suggested it would be good to give it to the people of the Hague for new initiatives.

<doc id="333788" wikidata="Q7069588" url="?curid=333788" title="Numbered highways in Canada">
<text>Numbered highways in Canada are split by province, and a majority are maintained by their province or territory transportation department. With few exceptions, all highways in Canada are numbered. Nonetheless, every province has a number of highways that are better known locally by their name rather than their number. Some highways have additional letters added to their number: A is typically an alternate route, B is typically a business route, and other letters are used for bypass (truck) routes, connector routes, scenic routes, and spur routes. The territory of Nunavut has no highways.

==Classifications==
This is a breakdown of the classifications of highways in each province, and an example shield of each classification where available.

<text>The Canadian province of Alberta has a provincial highway network consisting of over of roads as of 2021-2022, of which have been paved.

All of Alberta&#x27;s provincial highways are maintained by the Ministry of Transportation and Economic Corridors, a department of the Government of Alberta. The network includes two distinct series of numbered highways:

* The 1–216 series (formerly known as primary highways), making up Alberta&#x27;s core highway network—typically paved and with the highest traffic volume
* The 500–986 series, providing more local and rural access, with a higher proportion of gravel surfaces

== 1 - 216 series ==

Alberta&#x27;s 1 to 216 series of provincial highways are Alberta&#x27;s main highways. They are numbered from 1 to 100, with the exception of the ring roads around Calgary and Edmonton, which are numbered 201 and 216 respectively. The numbers applied to these highways are derived from compounding the assigned numbers of the core north–south and east–west highways that intersect with the rings roads. In Calgary, Highway 201 is derived from the north-south Highway 2 and the east-west Highway 1. In Edmonton, Highway 216 is derived from the same north-south Highway 2 and the east-west Highway 16.

Within this series, all or portions of Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 15, 16, 28, 28A, 35, 43, 49, 63, 201 and 216 are designated core routes of Canada&#x27;s National Highway System (NHS). Highway 28 from Highway 63 to Cold Lake is designated a NHS feeder route and Highway 58 between Rainbow Lake and Highway 88 is designated a NHS northern/remote route.

Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, and 43 are considered Alberta&#x27;s most important interprovincial and international highways and are divided highways (expressways) or freeways for much or all of their length. Speed limits are generally divided highways/freeways and on others. Segments of Highway 1 and Highway 16 through the national parks within Alberta&#x27;s Rockies that can be or .

The Highway 15/28A/28/63 corridor between Edmonton and Fort McMurray is considered one of Alberta&#x27;s most important intraprovincial highways. It is vital to the oilsands operation. 

Although only Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 15, 16, 43, 60, 63, 100, 201, and 216 are twinned (expressways) for most of their length, the vast majority of Alberta&#x27;s 1 to 216 series of highways are two-laned and paved. Only four highways within the series have segments that remained gravelled. These include segments of Highways 40, 58, and 68 and a short segment near the northern terminus of Highway 63.

Highways 1 and 16 are Trans-Canada Highway routes and are signed with TCH shields, not standard provincial shields.

































=== X series ===
The roads in the X series are typically highways that are planned realignments or spurs of existing highways. The numbers applied to each highway in the X series are derived from the highway that is planned for realignment or spurred from (e.g. Highway 16X will be a realignment of Highway 16, and Highway 10X is spur from Highway 10).








== 500 - 986 series ==

Alberta&#x27;s 500 - 986 series of provincial highways are generally considered local or rural highways. The 500 - 986 series of provincial highways is divided into three sub-series:

*The 500/600 highways are west–east roads where the numbering increases northward from the Montana border to the Northwest Territories border.
*The 700/800 highways are south–north roads where numbering increases eastward from the British Columbia border to the Saskatchewan border.
*The 900 highways are newer or planned roads that have been established for future consideration as or as potential extensions or realignments of highways within the 1 - 216 series.

Some of these highways are paved, while others are entirely or partially gravel. Rural speed limits range from to .
=== 500 ===
=== 600 ===
=== 700 ===
=== 800 ===
=== 900 ===
The 900 series includes highways that are planned realignments or extensions of existing highways. The numbers applied to each highway in the 900 series are derived from the highway that is planned to be realigned or extended (e.g. Highway 901 is a potential realignment of Highway 1 and Highway 986 is an extension of Highway 686).

<text>Ernest Dale Tubb (February 9, 1914 – September 6, 1984), nicknamed the Texas Troubadour, was an American singer and songwriter and one of the pioneers of country music. His biggest career hit song, &quot;Walking the Floor Over You&quot; (1941), marked the rise of the honky-tonk style of music.

In 1948, he was the first singer to record a hit version of Billy Hayes and Jay W. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;, a song more commonly associated with Elvis Presley and his late-1950s version. Another well-known Tubb hit was &quot;Waltz Across Texas&quot; (1965) (written by his nephew Quanah Talmadge Tubb, known professionally as Billy Talmadge), which became one of his most requested songs and is often used in dance halls throughout Texas during waltz lessons. Tubb recorded duets with the then up-and-coming Loretta Lynn in the early 1960s, including their hit &quot;Sweet Thang&quot;. Tubb is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==

===Early years===
The youngest of five children, Tubb was born on a cotton farm near Crisp, in Ellis County, Texas, United States. His father was a sharecropper and Tubb spent his youth working on farms throughout the state. Tubb&#x27;s earliest immigrant ancestor was Edward Tubb, who arrived in Virginia from Northamptonshire, England in 1701.

He was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and spent his spare time learning to sing, yodel, and play the guitar. At age 19, he took a job as a singer on San Antonio radio station KONO-AM. The pay was low and Tubb also dug ditches for the Works Progress Administration. He went on to be a clerk at a drug store.

In 1939, he moved to San Angelo, Texas and was hired to do a 15-minute afternoon live show on radio station KGKL-AM. He drove a beer delivery truck to support himself during this time, and during World War II he wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Swell San Angelo&quot;.

===Recording career===
In 1936, Tubb contacted Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; widow (Rodgers died in 1933) to ask for an autographed photo. A friendship developed and she was instrumental in getting Tubb a recording contract with RCA. His first two records were unsuccessful. A tonsillectomy in 1939 affected his singing style, so he turned to songwriting. In 1940, he switched to Decca Records to try singing again, and his sixth Decca release with the single &quot;Walking the Floor Over You&quot; brought Tubb to stardom. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc in 1965 by the Recording Industry Association of America. 

Tubb joined the Grand Ole Opry in February 1943 and put together his band, the Texas Troubadours. Tubb&#x27;s first band members were from Gadsden, Alabama. They were: Vernon &quot;Toby&quot; Reese, Chester Studdard, and Ray &quot;Kemo&quot; Head. He remained a regular on the radio show for four decades, and hosted his own &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; radio show each Saturday night after the Opry. Tubb headlined the first Grand Ole Opry show presented in Carnegie Hall in New York City in September 1947.

Tubb always surrounded himself with several of Nashville&#x27;s best musicians. Jimmy Short, his first guitarist in the Troubadours, is credited with the Tubb sound of single-string guitar picking. From about 1943 to 1948, Short was featured in clean, clear riffs throughout Tubb&#x27;s songs. Other well-known musicians to either travel with Tubb as band members or record on his records were steel guitarist Jerry Byrd and Tommy &quot;Butterball&quot; Paige, who replaced Short as Tubb&#x27;s lead guitarist in 1947. Billy Byrd joined the Troubadours in 1949 and brought jazzy riffs to the instrumental interludes, especially the four-note riff at the end of his guitar solos that would become synonymous with Tubb&#x27;s songs. A jazz musician, Byrd— no relation to Jerry— remained with Tubb until 1959.

Another Tubb musician was actually his producer, Owen Bradley. Bradley played piano on many of Tubb&#x27;s recordings from the 1950s, but Tubb wanted him to sound like Moon Mullican, the honky-tonk piano great of that era. The classically-trained Bradley tried, but could not quite match the sound, so Tubb said Bradley was &quot;half as good&quot; as Moon. When Tubb called out Bradley&#x27;s name at the start of one of the piano interludes, the singer always referred to him as &quot;Half-Moon&quot;.

In 1949, Tubb helped the famed boogie-woogie Andrews Sisters crossover to the country charts when they teamed on Decca Records to record a cover of Eddy Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Rob Another Man&#x27;s Castle&quot; and the Western swing-flavored &quot;I&#x27;m Bitin&#x27; My Fingernails and Thinking of You&quot;. Tubb was impressed by the enormous success of Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews, and he remembered that their 1947 recording of &quot;The Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn)&quot; with folk legend Burl Ives produced a top-10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit, and he was then eager to repeat that success. He brought the upbeat &quot;Fingernails&quot; tune to the session, hoping that the trio would like it, and they did. Not realizing how tall the Texas Troubadour was, the recording technicians at Decca had the sisters stand on a wooden box on one side of the one microphone they shared with Tubb so the audio would balance. The rhythm trio also was not used to Tubb&#x27;s vocal style, as Maxene once remembered, &quot;He sang different than anybody I&#x27;ve ever heard. He sang the melody of the song, but the timing was different. It wasn&#x27;t like we were used to...you sing eight bars, and then you sing eight bars, and then you sing eight bars. Not with him. He just sang eight bars, ten bars, eleven bars, and then stopped, whatever it was. So, we&#x27;d just start to follow him, and then got paid on 750,000 records sold that never came above the Mason-Dixon Line!&quot;

Tubb was not known to possess the most adept voice: he always sang flat and actually mocked his own singing. He told an interviewer that 95% of the men in bars would hear his music on the juke box and say to their girlfriends, &quot;I can sing better than him,&quot; and Tubb added they would be right. In fact he noticeably missed some notes on some recordings. When Tubb was recording &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Baby to Cry&quot; in 1949 and tried to hit a low note, Red Foley, his duet partner at the time was sitting in the booth when somebody said, &quot;I bet you wish you could hit that low note.&quot; Foley replied, &quot;I bet Ernest wishes &quot;he&quot; could hit that note.&quot; The two, who released seven albums together, maintained a friendly on-air &quot;feud&quot; over the years, and Tubb appeared on Foley&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; on ABC-TV.

In 1957, he walked into the lobby of the National Life Building in Nashville in the early morning hours and fired a .357 magnum, intending to shoot music producer Jim Denny. Instead, Tubb mistakenly shot at WSM news director, Bill Williams, as he was walking in to work. Luckily, Tubb barely missed (twice) before realizing he had shot at the wrong man. He was arrested and charged with public drunkenness.

In the 1960s, Tubb was well known for having one of the best bands in country music history. The band included lightning-fingered Leon Rhodes (1932–2017), who later appeared on TV&#x27;s &quot;Hee Haw&quot; as the guitarist in the show&#x27;s band. Buddy Emmons, another pedal-steel guitar virtuoso, began with Tubb in fall of 1957 and lasted through the early 1960s. Emmons went on to create a steel-guitar manufacturing company that bears his name. Buddy Charleton, one of the most accomplished pedal-steel guitarists known, joined Ernest in spring 1962 and continued to fall of 1973. Buddy Charleton and Leon Rhodes formed a nucleus for the Texas Troubadours that would be unsurpassed. Drummer Jack Greene joined the Texas Troubadours in 1962 and eventually graduated to becoming Tubb&#x27;s opening act and a standout country singer himself.

Beginning in the fall of 1965, he hosted a half-hour TV program, &quot;The Ernest Tubb Show&quot;, which aired in first-run syndication for three years. That same year, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 1970, Tubb was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

===Later years===

Tubb inspired some of the most devoted fans of any country artist — and his fans followed him throughout his career, long after the chart hits dried up. He remained, as did most of his peers, a fixture at the Grand Ole Opry, where he continued to appear. He continued to host his &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; radio program a few blocks away from the Opry at his record shop.

A notable release in 1979, &quot;The Legend and the Legacy&quot;, paired Tubb with a who&#x27;s who of country singers on the Cachet Records label, to which Tubb was connected financially. This long out-of-print duets album was re-released in 1999 as a CD on the First Generations label, on the 20th anniversary of its release, and it quickly went out of print again.

In 1980, he appeared as himself in Loretta Lynn&#x27;s autobiographical film, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; with Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl. His singing voice remained intact until late in life, when he fell ill with emphysema. Even so, he continued to make over 200 personal appearances a year, carrying an oxygen tank on his bus. After each performance, he would shake hands and sign autographs with every fan who wanted to stay. Health problems finally halted his performances in 1982; he made his final appearance on the Grand Ole Opry on August 15 of that year.

=== Death ===
Tubb died on September 6, 1984, at the Baptist Hospital in Nashville from emphysema. He is buried in Nashville&#x27;s Hermitage Memorial Gardens.

==Legacy==

Tubb was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999, and he ranked No. 21 in CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003.

One of his sons, Justin, was a popular country singer and songwriter in the mid-1950s through the early 1960s; Justin&#x27;s sons, Carey and Zachary Tubb, also became musicians. Tubb&#x27;s nephew, Billy Lee Tubb, was his lead guitarist briefly (fall 1959 – April 1960). He also had solo careers under several pseudonyms (Ronny Wade, X. Lincoln) and played with John Anderson, writing several songs with him. Tubb&#x27;s great nephew, Lucky Tubb, has toured with Hank Williams III.

Cal Smith, who played guitar for the Texas Troubadours during the 1960s, went on to a successful country music career of his own in the 1970s, recording hits such as &quot;Country Bumpkin&quot;.

Jack Greene, who played drums for the Texas Troubadours, went on to become a successful country music star following his departure from Tubb&#x27;s band, recording the hits &quot;There Goes My Everything&quot; and &quot;Statue of a Fool&quot;.

Ernest Tubb&#x27;s nephew, Glenn Douglas Tubb, wrote his first hit song for his uncle in 1952. He went on to write more than 50 hit songs for more than two dozen country and rock music superstars, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, BJ Thomas, George Jones, Kentucky Headhunters, Charlie Pride, Ann Murray, and Kitty Wells. Glenn Tubb won a Grammy Award for &quot;Skip a Rope&quot;, which was made a hit by Henson Cargill. Glenn Douglas Tubb died in 2021.

The &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; Tubb founded in 1947 continues to air, recorded each weekend from a stage at his record shop and airing after each episode of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

The song &quot;Set &#x27;Em Up Joe&quot;, recorded and made famous by Vern Gosdin, was a tribute to Tubb&#x27;s music, particularly the song &quot;Walking the Floor Over You&quot;. The Ernest Tubb Record Store, founded in 1947, is still in operation in Nashville and is now owned by Robert&#x27;s Western World. On March 11, 2022, the store owners announced on their Facebook page that the business and its real estate had been sold, and the store would close at an unspecified time.

<text>Royal Air Force Woodvale or more simply RAF Woodvale is a Royal Air Force Station located next to the towns of Formby and Ainsdale in an area called Woodvale which is located to the south of Southport, Merseyside. Woodvale was constructed as an all-weather night fighter airfield for the defence of Liverpool. However, it did not open until 7 December 1941 which was just after the Liverpool Blitz which peaked in May of that year.

==History==
===Second World War===
Woodvale opened in December 1941, six months after the end of the Liverpool Blitz. It was used for short periods by RAF squadrons that were rotated out of the zones in southern of England closest to German-occupied Europe. During their time at Woodvale, squadrons defended Merseyside. Polish 308 (Krakowski) Squadron was the first to arrive, on 12 December 1941, from RAF Northolt before leaving on 1 April 1942. Squadrons were rotated regularly. Several were Polish, including 315 (Dęblinski) Squadron and 317 (Wilenski) Squadron. Spitfire IIs and Vbs were operated by these units.

Support units working with all three Services also served there, calibrating anti-aircraft guns and towing targets for the Royal Navy. In April 1945, Woodvale briefly became a Tender for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm airfield at Burscough, HMS &quot;Ringtail&quot;, being given the name HMS &quot;Ringtail II&quot;.

===Cold war===

After a period of inactivity, Woodvale reopened on 22 July 1946, when the Spitfire Mk.14s of No. 611 (West Lancashire) Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, moved here from Liverpool Airport at Speke. The squadron re-equipped with Spitfire Mk.22s in February 1949.

Gloster Meteor F.4 and F.8 jets were flown between May 1951 until 9 July 1951. Because of the need for better facilities, the Squadron moved to RAF Hooton Park, joining No. 610 Squadron, where it remained until its disbandment on 10 March 1957. The Temperature and Humidity Flight, operating Spitfires and Mosquitos, was based there from 1953 to 1958.

The last operational flight by an RAF Spitfire was flown from Woodvale in 1957. Its mission was related to the work of a meteorological unit stationed at the base.

No. 5 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co-Operation Unit moved to Woodvale on 1 January 1958, and operated target-towing Meteors until 30 September 1971 when the unit was disbanded.

===Training station===
Since 1971, RAF Woodvale has remained a training station. Liverpool University Air Squadron- LUAS moved in from RAF Hooton Park on 2 July 1951. Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron (then named Manchester University Air Squadron) (MUAS) (now MASUAS) moved in from Manchester&#x27;s Barton Aerodrome in March 1953. 10 Air Experience Flight was formed at RAF Woodvale on 25 August 1958 and 631 Volunteer Gliding Squadron moved in from RAF Sealand in March 2006.

The current station commander is Squadron Leader Mark Barrett.

A BAe Hawk T1A, number XX247, was installed as the site&#x27;s gate guardian in November 2017, replacing an earlier Jet Provost.

==Woodvale Rally==

In 1971, RAF Woodvale hosted the first annual Woodvale International Rally. The event is a charitable event, that originally began as a model aircraft show. It has grown over the years to include car clubs with both classic cars, vintage cars and other vehicle displays. It usually occupies the first weekend in August. The 2012 rally had to be re-located and rescheduled to nearby Victoria Park, Southport, Merseyside, on safety grounds. Asbestos was discovered from old World War II structures that had been buried long ago.

==Merseyside Police Air Support Group==

Basing the Merseyside Air Support Group at RAF Woodvale made the station something of a target for criminals. Just before 2230 on Friday 9 October 2009 a window of the helicopter was smashed and petrol poured inside causing the helicopter to be grounded.

On 17 May 2010 the Merseyside Police helicopter was again attacked and grounded, after four masked intruders broke into the airbase at around 04:00 causing what was described as minor damage.

As part of the reorganisation of Police Air Support in England and Wales and the formation of the National Police Air Service, Merseyside operationally retired its dedicated Police helicopter &quot;G-XMII&quot; in July 2011. Cover would then be provided with four aircraft from Cheshire, Lancashire, North Wales and Greater Manchester, the nearest to Merseyside being based at Hawarden Airport with &quot;G-XMII&quot; providing back up. From 1 June 2012, Merseyside Police signed a four-year deal to lease the helicopter to the Norwegian Police Service in response to the 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway.

==Freedom of the Borough==
RAF Woodvale was granted the Freedom of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on 17 May 2011.

<doc id="333807" wikidata="Q1975627" url="?curid=333807" title="St Alfege Church, Greenwich">
<text>St Alfege Church is an Anglican church in the centre of Greenwich, part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich in London. It is of medieval origin and was rebuilt in 1712–1714 to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor.

==Early history==

The church is dedicated to Alfege (also spelt &quot;Alphege&quot;), Archbishop of Canterbury, and reputedly marks the place where he was martyred on 19 April 1012, having been taken prisoner during the sack of Canterbury by Danish raiders the previous year. The Danes took him to their camp at Greenwich and killed him when the large ransom they demanded was not forthcoming.

The church was rebuilt in around 1290, and Henry VIII was baptized there in 1491.

The patronage of the church was given to the abbey at Ghent during the 13th century. Following the suppression of alien priories under Henry V, it was granted to the priory at Sheen with which it remained until transferred to the Crown by exchange under Henry VIII in 1530.

During a storm in 1710 the medieval church collapsed, its foundations having been weakened by burials both inside and outside.

==The present church==

Following the collapse of the medieval church, the present building was constructed, funded by a grant from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor, one of the commission&#x27;s two surveyors. The first church to be built by the commissioners, it was begun in 1712 and basic construction was completed in 1714; it was not, however, consecrated until 1718. The church was built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.

The church is rectangular in plan with a flat ceiling and a small apse serving as a chancel. The east front, towards the street, has a portico in the Tuscan order, with a central arch cutting through the entablature and pediment—a motif used in Wren&#x27;s &quot;Great Model&quot; for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. A giant order of pilasters runs around the rest of the church, a feature Kerry Downes suggests may have been added by Thomas Archer, who, according to the minutes of the commission, &quot;improved&quot; Hawksmoor&#x27;s plans. On the north and south sides of the churchwide projecting vestibules rise to the full height of the building, with steps leading up to the doors.

Hawksmoor planned a west tower, in the position of the existing one, which had survived the collapse. However the commission was reluctant to fund it, and the medieval tower was retained. In 1730 John James refaced it, and added a spire. Hawksmoor&#x27;s design, published in an engraving in 1714, had an octagonal lantern at the top, a motif he was later to use at St George in the East.

The crypt served as an air-raid shelter during World War II. During the Blitz on 19 March 1941, incendiary bombs landed on the roof causing it to collapse, burning into the nave. The walls and the tower remained standing but much of the interior was gutted. The church was restored by Sir Albert Richardson in 1953. As part of the post-war restorations, stencils of Mary the Mother of Jesus and St John the Evangelist were installed either side of the Cross (forming a traditional rood) in the side chapel of St Alfege with St Peter by the tempera artist Augustus Lunn.

===Organs===
The present organ was installed in 2001, having been relocated from the Lower Chapel at Eton College, with some minor changes. It is an 1891 Lewis &amp; Co instrument, with modifications in 1927 by A. Hunter &amp; Son and 1970 by Harrison &amp; Harrison. 

Additionally, there is a small, six-stop moveable organ located in the north aisle, by W &amp; A Boggis of Diss from c 1960, with a later restoration by Mander Organs.

====Tallis organ====
The previous organ had a long history. It dated from the 16th century (when St Alfege was recorded as having a pair of organs).
The National Pipe Organ Register does not record its present whereabouts. However, a three manual drawstop console is on display at the West End of the South aisle. This may incorporate keys from the time of the composer Thomas Tallis, who was buried in the chancel of the medieval church in the 16th century.
The organ was restored in 1706 by Thomas Swarbrick, with further restorations and modifications by Dallam (1765), George England (1770) and J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd (1840, 1853 and 1863). It was further restored and rebuilt in 1875 by Joseph Robson and Benjamin Flight, modified by Lewis &amp; Co in 1910 and rebuilt by R. Spurden Rutt &amp; Co in 1934. By this point it had grown to 47 stops. It survived the bomb damage of 1941 and was rebuilt, again by R Spurden Rutt, in 1953, with 55 stops. 


The church is currently used to celebrate &quot;Founder&#x27;s Day&quot; of Addey and Stanhope School and The John Roan School.

===Churchyards===
The church had two churchyards, which were closed to burials in 1853. In 1889 they were transferred to the Greenwich District Board of Works. The later of the two churchyards was laid out as a garden and recreation ground by the landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson, and opened in 1889. It was renamed St Alfege Park. Wilkinson planted 500 trees.

In 2015 a fund-raising cream tea garden party for Christian Aid, held in the churchyard after the Sunday sermon, was stormed by armed police. An attendee said that the vicar&#x27;s wife was &quot;almost knocked over by a policeman with a huge machine gun”, but &quot;people just carried on drinking their tea&quot; in a display of typical British fortitude even though &quot;all these armed police bursting in was like the film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;”. The police proceeded to the adjacent St Alfege Park, where a man was arrested and a firearm found.

Notable people buried in and around the church include the Renaissance choirmaster and composer William Newark (died 1509, no surviving memorial), Richard Bower (died 1561), Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal 1545–1561, the composer Thomas Tallis (died 1585), the courtier Elizabeth Roper (died 1658), the merchant Sir John Lethieullier (died 1719) on the outer south-west corner of the church, the English-born explorer of Canada Henry Kelsey (died 1724), General James Wolfe, the victor over the French in Canada but who died in the process at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, the actress Lavinia Fenton (died 1760), and the MP Sir James Creed (died 1762), against the outer north wall.

Sarah Barrett Moulton, the Jamaican-born schoolgirl (1783–1795) who was the subject of the celebrated painting &quot;Pinkie&quot; (shown above right), was buried in the church after dying aged twelve, just a year after her portrait had been painted. The merchant, Lloyd&#x27;s underwriter and art collector John Julius Angerstein (died 1823), who was a churchwarden in the early 19th century, is also buried here.

==Literary connection==
In Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, Bella Wilfer marries John Rokesmith in St Alfege Church.

In Tom McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;C&quot;, after a Marinettiesque car crash, Serge Carrefax laughs from his position within the upturned chassis. This laughter is &quot;a pleasant noise; reminds him of liturgical chants and whispers echoing around St. Alfege&#x27;s interior.&quot;

<doc id="333808" wikidata="Q280427" url="?curid=333808" title="Bell XP-83">
<text>The Bell XP-83 (later redesignated XF-83) was a United States prototype jet escort fighter designed by Bell Aircraft during World War II. It first flew in 1945. As with most early first generation jet fighters, the design was hampered by a relative lack of power. With the rapid advancements in jet technology post-WWII, the XP-83 was soon eclipsed by more advanced designs and it never entered production.

==Design and development==
The early jet fighters consumed fuel at a prodigious rate which severely limited their range and endurance. In March 1944, the United States Army Air Forces requested Bell to design a fighter with increased endurance and formally awarded a contract for two prototypes on 31 July 1944.

Bell had been working on its &quot;Model 40&quot; interceptor design since 1943. It was redesigned as a long-range escort fighter while retaining the general layout of the P-59 Airacomet. The two General Electric J33-GE-5 turbojet engines were located in each wing root which left the large and bulky fuselage free for fuel tanks and armament. The fuselage was an all-metal semimonocoque capable of carrying 1,150 gal (4,350 L) of fuel. In addition, two 250 gal (950 L) drop tanks could be carried. The cabin was pressurized and used a small and low bubble style canopy. The armament was to be six 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose.

==Testing==
Early wind tunnel reports had pinpointed directional instability but the &quot;fix&quot; of a larger tail would not be ready in time for flight testing. 

The first prototype was flown on 25 February 1945, by Bell&#x27;s chief test pilot, Jack Woolams. He found it to have satisfactory flight characteristics, although it was under-powered. The expected instability was confirmed – spins were avoided (until a larger tail fin was installed). The second prototype did incorporate a modified tail and an aileron boost system. One unusual characteristic was extremely high landing speeds, due to factors including the XP-83&#x27;s lack of drag brakes – in addition to the sleek aerodynamics and relatively high minimum thrust settings common to early jet aircraft, and necessary to prevent unintended flame-outs. This meant that test pilots were forced to fly &quot;stabilized approaches&quot; (i.e. very long and flat landing approaches).

The first prototype was used in 1946 as a ramjet test-bed with an engineer&#x27;s station located in the fuselage behind the pilot. On 14 September 1946, one of the ramjets caught fire forcing pilot, &quot;Slick&quot; Goodlin and engineer Charles Fay, to bail out. The second prototype flew on 19 October and was later scrapped in 1947. Apart from range, the XP-83 was inferior to the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and this led to the cancellation of the XP-83 project in 1947.

<doc id="333811" wikidata="Q5159533" url="?curid=333811" title="Conestoga Parkway">
<text>The Conestoga Parkway, officially the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway,
is a controlled-access highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, located entirely within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. The route travels east and then north through the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, and is connected to Highway 401 via Highway 8 and King Street East. The name Conestoga Parkway is not a formal designation, but rather a local name applied to the divided expressway portions of Highway 7, Highway8 and Highway 85 through Kitchener and Waterloo. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), which built and maintains the route, refers to it as the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway.

Originally conceived as a ring road in the 1940s, the concept evolved into a pair of at-grade four lane boulevards known as Henry Sturm Boulevard (east–west) and Dryden Boulevard (north–south), for which land was gradually purchased through the 1950s and into the early 1960s. The completion of Highway401 between Toronto and Highway8 in 1960 resulted in businesses relocating closer to it; consequently, traffic planners redesigned the boulevards into a continuous four lane expressway in 1962.

Construction of the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway began in 1966 with the rebuilding of King Street East into a divided highway. This project also resulted in the construction of the interchange with the future expressway, which was named the Conestoga Parkway in 1967. The northern and western legs were built outwards from this interchange simultaneously over the following five years, opening in sections between 1968 and 1971. At that time, the route extended west to Fischer-Hallman Road and north to the southern interchange with King Street North. Two lane extensions opened in 1973 and 1977 to connect the parkway with New Hamburg and St. Jacobs, respectively. Portions of these were expanded to four lanes in the early 1990s. A series of projects saw the parkway completely rebuilt through its central section between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, including a concrete median barrier, additional lanes, and a new flyover ramp at Highway8.

An ongoing but frequently delayed project to construct a new freeway between Kitchener and Guelph will see a new interchange built at the existing Wellington Street interchange, in addition to the numerous bridges that have already been lengthened in the vicinity. There is currently no projected timeline for the construction of completion of this project as of 2022.

== Route description ==

The Conestoga Parkway is a controlled-access freeway serving the twin cities of Kitchener and Waterloo. The route, which forms the rough shape of a backwards &quot;L&quot;, serves as the backbone of the two cities. As the concurrency of Highway7 and Highway8 enters the city of Kitchener as a freeway from the west, it takes on the name Conestoga Parkway at the Waterloo Regional Road 70 (Trussler Road) exit at the western edge of the city. The parkway travels east until Highway8 diverges southeast toward Cambridge. Now carrying only the Highway7 designation, the Conestoga Parkway curves northward. At the Frederick Street and Victoria Street interchange, Highway7 exits the parkway and follows Victoria Street east toward Guelph; the parkway henceforth is signed as Highway85 to its northern end, which lies approximately north of the Waterloo city limits.
The Conestoga Parkway is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), which officially refers to it as the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway.
The speed limit on the parkway is throughout its length.

=== Western leg ===
At the Kitchener city limits at Trussler Road the concurrency of Highway7/8 continues west as a four lane freeway towards Stratford. Within Kitchener, the Conestoga Parkway consistently acts as the boundary for neighbourhoods to either side of it.
Initially, it is sandwiched between the suburban residential neighbourhoods of Forest Heights and Laurentian West neighbourhoods, to the north and south respectively, as it travels east to Regional Road58 (Fischer–Hallman Road). There the median switches from grass to a concrete barrier, and the parkway widens to six lanes. It passes north of the Sunrise Shopping Centre before once again bisecting residential neighbourhoods, namely Forest Hill and Meinzinger Park to the north and Laurentian Hills to the south.

Approaching the Regional Road28 (Homer Watson Boulevard) interchange – which provides access to Regional Road 4 (Ottawa Street) – retail and light industry in the Alpine neighbourhood begin to flank the southern side of the Conestoga Parkway. It then crosses over the Canadian National Railways Huron Park spur, the adjacent ION LRT line, and Schneider Creek immediately west of an interchange with Regional Road53 (Courtland Avenue). Now serving as the boundary between the residential neighbourhoods of Rockway to the north and Vanier to the south, the route curves north-northeast to reach an interchange with the Freeport Diversion (also known as the King Street Bypass or Highway8 expressway).

=== Northern leg ===

The portion of the Conestoga Parkway that travels perpendicular to King Street East follows alongside Montgomery Creek. Now eight-lanes wide, it passes over Weber Street and then curves north-northwest to avoid the Stanley Park Conservation Area, with the neighbourhoods of Eastwood to the west, and Stanley Park to the southeast. The parkway follows the former alignment of Edna Street north to Frederick Street,
with the neighbourhoods of Auditorium and Central Frederick to the west, and Rosemount to the east. It briefly swerves northwards, passing under Frederick Street, Victoria Street and the Kitchener GO line in quick succession. An interchange serves both Frederick Street and Victoria Street, via the parallel roads of Regional Road62 (Edna Street) and Regional Road61 (Bruce Street); an interchange with Wellington Street follows soon thereafter. Due to the close proximately of these two interchanges, the Conestoga Parkway utilizes a brief local–express system for approximately .

Now passing through light industry in the Northward neighbourhood, the Conestoga Parkway makes a broad curve to the west to avoid the Grand River and meets Regional Road29 (Lancaster Street), which features a partial interchange. The median barrier ends immediately after, and a grass median begins. To the south is the neighbourhood of Fairfield, while Bridgeport lies to the north. The route gradually curves back to the north and enters the city of Waterloo at Regional Road9 (Bridgeport Road), with which there is an interchange.
The Conestoga Parkway enters into Waterloo with the suburban neighbourhood of Lincoln Heights to the west and greenfields and Betchel Park to the east. After , it crosses Laurel Creek and encounters an interchange with Regional Road57 (University Avenue) before curving gradually to the west-northwest. With the neighbourhoods of Lincoln West to the south and Foxhunt to the north, the parkway encounters the first of two interchanges with Regional Road 15 (King Street North); Conestoga Mall lies to the northeast. It becomes parallel to Forwell Creek as it curves back northward, after which the parkway travels parallel to and east of the Waterloo Central Railway for the remainder of its length. An interchange with Regional Road50 (Northfield Drive) also carries the ION LRT line over the route as it travels through an area of light industry. Just prior to the second interchange with King Street North, the Conestoga Parkway exits Waterloo into the township of Woolwich.
Both the parkway and Highway85 end approximately north of King Street North, after which the four lane freeway narrows and is known as Waterloo Regional Road85.

Although the concept of a ring road around Kitchener and Waterloo originated from the Kitchener-Waterloo and Suburban Planning Board in 1948,
actual consideration was not given to it until it was recommended by a 1961 traffic study.
By then, the opening of Highway 401 was attracting business away from the rapidly growing twin cities. Land was gradually purchased over the intervening years and picked up considerably when plans for the expressway system were first raised in late 1962.
The ring road prior to this point had evolved to a proposed pair of east–west and north–south four lane boulevards known as Henry Strum Boulevard and Dryden Boulevard. However, Kitchener planning director Bill Thompson changed this to a single controlled-access highway.
The Department of Highways had already begun construction in the fall of 1961 on the Freeport Diversion, providing a new divided crossing of the Grand River along Highway 8. The diversion, connecting with King Street south of the Grand River and at Fergus Street, was completed in 1963.

The provincial government reached a funding arrangement with Kitchener and Waterloo to cover 75% of the expected C$22 million ($ in dollars). cost, and officially announced the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway on May21, 1964.
The province eventually took over authority for the entire project in August 1965.
Construction began in February 1966 with the awarding of a C$3 million ($ in dollars). contract to rebuild of King Street into a four lane divided highway from Fairway Road (renamed from Block Line Road in 1965) to Doon Road,
including the half cloverleaf interchange that would serve the western and northern legs of the expressway system.
A ground-breaking ceremony was held in the fall of that year, with dignitaries taking turns driving a bulldozer.
In anticipation of the long-term construction, Highway8 was redirected along Fairway Road, Mill Street (now Vanier Drive) and the short section of Henry Sturm Boulevard that was constructed from Ottawa Street and Highland Road to Mill Street.
The reconstruction of King Street was completed and opened in November 1967.
The Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway was unofficially renamed the Conestoga Parkway in January 1967 by a joint committee of the two cities. A shortlist of 12 publicly-submitted names was prepared, and included Mackenzie King, John Patrick, Eby-Erb (early Mennonite settlers), Dan Detweiller (a founder of the Ontario hydroelectric system), Frederick Banting, Centennial, Pioneer, Grand Valley, Golden Triangle, The Kingsway, and Conestoga. The name, a reference to the Mennonite conestoga wagon used by early settlers, was chosen unanimously by the committee.

On the northern leg of the parkway, early works construction along Edna Street, including the removal of several dozen homes, began in 1966, and tenders were called for construction of the route from King Street to Frederick Street in September. Full construction on the C$1.9million ($ in dollars). contract began in April 1967.
It was completed and opened to traffic on September19, 1968.
Another contract, to build the parkway from Frederick Street and Bridgeport Road, was awarded that month for C$5.1million ($ in dollars)., with construction beginning in October.
On the western leg of the parkway, construction began in October 1967 on a C$3.6 million ($ in dollars). contract to build a segment of the parkway from King Street to west of Homer Watson Boulevard.
This section, which was built along the alignment of Henry Strum Boulevard, was opened to traffic between Courtland Avenue and King Street on November25, 1968.

Work continued on the Conestoga Parkway into the early 1970s. On the northern leg, the segment under construction between Frederick Street and Bridgeport Road was completed and opened on October5 or 6, 1970.
Just over a month later, on November13, the first portion of the expressway within Waterloo was opened ceremoniously by Minister of Highways George Gomme.
Construction of this section, through undeveloped farmland between Bridgeport Road and the southern interchange with King Street North, took place beginning in 1969.
On the western leg, a section between Courtland Avenue and Fischer-Hallman Drive opened on September1, 1971, completing the Kitchener–Waterloo Expressway project.

By this time, construction was underway on a new two lane alignment of Highway7/8, first announced in 1963, to connect the New Hamburg Diversion with the Conestoga Parkway at Fischer-Hallman Drive. It opened on August13, 1973, bypassing the community of Baden.
To the north, construction of a two lane alignment of Highway 85 to connect the Conestoga Parkway, at the southern intersection of King Street North, with the St. Jacobs Bypass began in 1974. The extension, which featured an at-grade intersection with Northfield Road and a grade-separation with the northern King Street North, was opened in late August, 1977.

=== Since completion ===
As each section of the Conestoga Parkway opened, the DHO moved portions of Highways7, 8 and 85 onto it. By 1972, the current configuration of the three highways was established.
However, in 1980 or 1981, Highway85 was renumbered as Highway86.

It remained as such until the spring of 2003, when several highways in Ontario were renumbered to improve route number continuity and aid navigation. Among them was the renumbering of Highway86 back to Highway85, restoring the original numbering scheme of the parkway.

The two lane segment of Highway 7/8 from Fischer-Hallman Road west to Baden was originally slated to be twinned to four lanes in the 1980s, but the project was put off for a decade. Early works tree clearing got underway in 1991 before being put on hold for archeological excavations.
Construction began to widen the route as far west as Waterloo Regional Road12 (Queen Street), south of Petersburg, on July6, 1992, with a planned completion by August 1993.
The lack of a median barrier between the opposing lanes of the parkway led to numerous crossover collisions; between May 1990 and July 1993, eight deaths were directly attributed to vehicles crossing the grass median and striking vehicles in the opposing lane head on.
Following the death of Laurie Brain on April8, 1990, a coroners jury on October9, 1991, recommended several immediate improvements to the parkway, including the installation of a median barrier as well as lowering the speed limit from to .
The speed limit was reduced to 90km/h on January11, 1994,
while construction to install a barrier between Frederick Street and Lancaster Street began in July 1994.
The work, which also included the construction of storm drainage, was completed by the summer of 1995.
Construction of a barrier between Homer Watson Boulevard and Frederick Street began in July 1997,
and was completed by November.
In the early 1990s, the provincial government announced plans to widen the Conestoga Parkway and Freeport Diversion, as well as to improve the interchange between the two.
The project was broken into several phases, and included rebuilding the Ottawa Street and Franklin Street overpasses.
Construction began in August or September 1998 to widen the Conestoga Parkway from four to six lanes between Courtland Avenue and King Street, from four to eight lanes between King Street and Ottawa Street, and from four to six lanes between Ottawa Street and Frederick Street.
This stage of the project was completed in July 2000.

The expansion of Highway8 from four lanes to eight lanes between the Conestoga Parkway and Fergus Avenue was originally scheduled to begin in 2001, but was delayed as businesses along Weber Street fought expropriation.
Construction instead began in April 2002, which involved shifting one of the retaining walls further north and a new Franklin Street bridge to accommodate the eight lane cross-section freeway. Included with this project was a reconstruction of the bottle-necked interchange of the Conestoga Parkway and Highway8, including a new flyover ramp from westbound Conestoga Parkway to eastbound Highway8 to replace one of the two loop ramps, and realignment of the northbound to eastbound ramp.
Both were completed and opened on June11, 2004.

Construction began in 2012 to widen the parkway to six lanes from east of Courtland Avenue to west of Fischer-Hallman Road, including the installation of a median barrier.
The C$130 million project was completed in 2016.

== Future ==
Long term plans have called for the construction of a freeway link between Kitchener and Guelph, linking the Conestoga Parkway with the Hanlon Expressway (Highway 6). Although proposed in the 1980s, construction did not begin until 2015.
Opposition arose due to the new alignment of this Highway7 freeway passing through environmentally sensitive lands. In particular, the $25 million cost of the interchange between the new freeway and the Conestoga Parkway; the high cost is partly due to land acquisition to accommodate the proposed flyover ramps. This represents a quarter of the projected C$100million budget for the total Highway7 project.
The Victoria Street overpass was demolished overnight on February23–24, 2018, and was replaced with a new structure that reopened to traffic on October28; the new bridge is longer and has a higher elevation to accommodate the future ramps between Highway7 and the Conestoga Parkway.

<doc id="333812" wikidata="Q1031065" url="?curid=333812" title="Underdog (TV series)">
<text>Underdog, also known as The Underdog Show, is an American Saturday morning animated television series that ran from October 3, 1964, to March 4, 1967, starting on the NBC network until 1966, with the rest of the run on CBS, under the primary sponsorship of General Mills, for a run of 62 episodes. It is one of the early Saturday morning cartoons. The show continued in syndication until 1973.

Underdog, Shoeshine Boy&#x27;s heroic alter ego, appears whenever love interest Sweet Polly Purebred is being victimized by such villains as Simon Bar Sinister or Riff Raff. Underdog nearly always speaks in rhyming couplets, as in &quot;There&#x27;s no need to fear, Underdog is here!&quot; His voice was supplied by Wally Cox. When appearing as Shoeshine Boy, he described himself as &quot;humble, and loveable&quot;; possibly a tongue-in-cheek reference to &quot;mild-mannered reporter&quot; Clark Kent from the opening narration of the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; television series.

==History==
In 1959, handling the General Mills account as an account executive with the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency in New York, W. Watts Biggers teamed with Chet Stover, Treadwell D. Covington, and artist Joe Harris in the creation of television cartoon shows to sell breakfast cereals for General Mills. The shows introduced such characters as King Leonardo, Tennessee Tuxedo, and Underdog. Biggers and Stover contributed both scripts and songs to the series. When &quot;Underdog&quot; became a success, Biggers and his partners left Dancer Fitzgerald Sample to form their own company, Total Television, with animation produced at Gamma Studios in Mexico. In 1969, Total Television folded when General Mills dropped out as the primary sponsor, but continued to retain the rights to the series until 1995 and TV distribution rights, through NBCUniversal Television Distribution, to the present day.

===Abroad and in syndication===
The syndicated version of &quot;The Underdog Show&quot; consists of 62 half-hour episodes. The supporting segments differ from the show&#x27;s original network run. The first 26 syndicated episodes feature &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo&quot; as a supporting segment. (&quot;Tennessee Tuxedo&quot; originally aired as a separate show and also has its own syndicated adaptation.) Thereafter, for most of the balance of the package, the middle segments include &quot;Go Go Gophers&quot; and &quot;Klondike Kat&quot; for three consecutive half-hours and &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo&quot; in the fourth. &quot;Commander McBragg&quot; is featured in the majority of episodes, replaced by three segments of &quot;The Sing-A-Long Family&quot; (in shows one-three, 28–30, and 55–57). The final two syndicated &quot;Underdog&quot; half-hours feature two one-shot cartoons that were originally part of an unsold pilot for a projected 1966 series, &quot;The Champion&quot; (&quot;Cauliflower Cabbie&quot; and &quot;Gene Hattree&quot;), with &quot;Commander McBragg&quot; appearing in show 61 and &quot;Go Go Gophers&quot; in show 62.

The syndicated series, as shown in the United States, is a potpourri of segments from previously aired versions of the show. Prior to a 1994 remaster, each episode included a &quot;teaser&quot; at the top of the show, asking viewers to stay tuned for a clip from &quot;today&#x27;s four-part story&quot;. (This originates from a 1969–1973 NBC Saturday morning rerun version of the show.) However, outside of CBS-TV airings of the show, no more than two parts of the &quot;Underdog&quot; stories were ever shown in any half-hour program. There have also been different syndication packages bundled with both elements from Jay Ward’s &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Most Important Person&quot; short films. Prints of such would either be followed by a closing and credits or no credits at all. The closing (which showed the first portion of a variation of the &quot;Underdog&quot; theme showing a giant terrorizing the city with George S. Irving, the series narrator, saying, &quot;Looks like this is the end! But don&#x27;t miss our next Underdog Show!&quot; in place of the theme music) followed by the end credits (re-edited from the cast credits for &quot;Underdog&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo&quot;), originated from a 1965 repackaged syndicated series, &quot;Cartoon Cut-Ups,&quot; which originally featured Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo, and Commander McBragg. As the &quot;Underdog&quot;, &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, and &quot;The Most Important Person&quot; segments are all now separately owned by different entities, the syndicated prints are no longer in distribution.

Most stories were split into 4 parts, but the first four were stand-alone stories:
* &quot;Safe Waif&quot;, the pilot, featured a rescue from a bank vault, but no villain. Underdog is shown causing major destruction while trying to help people.
* &quot;March of the Monsters&quot;, the first appearance of Sweet Polly Purebred, has giant robots running amok.
* &quot;Simon Says&quot; is the first appearance of Simon Bar Sinister. &quot;Simon says HOLD IT!&quot; is the maniacal refrain, as Bar Sinister uses a weird camera to turn his victims into full-sized, two-dimensional photographs.
* &quot;Tricky Trap by Tap Tap&quot; is the epilogue to the multi-part story &quot;From Hopeless to Helpless&quot; featuring Riff Raff.

Reruns of the show aired on Nickelodeon from 1992 to 1994, Cartoon Network from 1996 to 1999, Boomerang from 2002 to 2007, and on MeTV Toons since 2024. However during its broadcasting on Cartoon Network and Boomerang, two notable episodes, &quot;The Molemen&quot; and &quot;A New Villain&quot;, were not included on the channels’ schedule due to depicted dangerous elements subjected within the segments.

In 1995, Biggers, Stover, Covington, and Harris (with General Mills) negotiated a sale of their creations to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels&#x27; Broadway Video, who later sold the rights to Golden Books Family Entertainment in 1996. When Classic Media took over Golden Books in August 2001, it acquired the underlying rights to &quot;Underdog.&quot; In 2012, Classic Media was sold to DreamWorks Animation, and ultimately became the property of the series&#x27; current owners, Universal Television as a result of Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Underdog&quot; as number 23 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list, IGN ranked it as number 74 on its Best 100 Animated Series list.

==Superpowers==
When he is not Underdog, he is &quot;incognito&quot; as Shoeshine Boy. Like Superman, when trouble calls, he hurriedly runs into a telephone booth (which would inexplicably explode upon his transmutation). On occasion, to replenish his powers, he would take an &quot;Underdog Super Energy Pill&quot;. This pill was first introduced in episode 9. He keeps one of these pills inside a special ring he wears at all times. (Before taking one, he would often utter the words: &quot;The secret compartment of my ring I fill / With an Underdog Super Energy Pill.&quot;) Several episodes, starting with &quot;RiffRaffville&quot;, show Underdog without his ring and being powerless, since he must take another pill as his super powers begin to fail (&quot;Without my Energy Vitamin Pill / I grow weaker and weaker and weaker still.&quot;) and, as a result, he can die; but of course, this being a children&#x27;s cartoon show, no one actually kills him, even when he is at their mercy. He tells everyone who will listen this secret of his super powers. When the series was syndicated in the 1980s and 1990s, the scenes of him taking his energy pill were edited out. In the recent release &quot;Underdog: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, the word &quot;Energy&quot; was replaced with &quot;Vitamin&quot;.

Underdog is shown to have incredible superhuman powers. However, the number and scope of his superpowers are inconsistent from episode to episode, being subject not only to the conventions of superhero comics, but also to the conventions of humorous cartoons. In one episode, he easily moved planets, safely butting against them with his rear end. In another episode, his Super Energy Pill, diluted billions of times when added to a city&#x27;s water system, was capable of giving normal humans who drank the water enough strength to easily bend thick steel bars. Among his many powers shown on the show are: super strength, super speed, supersonic flight, physical invulnerability, X-ray vision, super breath, cosmic vision, atomic breath, atomizing eyes, heat vision, ultrasonic hearing, a supersonic high-pitch hi-fi voice and a great calculating brain.

==Other media==

===Books and comics===
* Underdog has also appeared in one Little Golden Book, &quot;Underdog and the Disappearing Ice Cream&quot; in 1975.
* Charlton Comics produced a comic book that ran 10 issues from July 1970 to January 1972, mainly adapting stories from the cartoon.
* Gold Key Comics produced a comic book that ran 23 issues from March 1975 to February 1979. Unlike the Charlton run, these featured original stories.
* Spotlight Comics did three issues in 1987.
* Harvey Comics did a one-shot in 1993, and a five-issue series from November 1993 to July 1994. These issues reprinted comics from the Charlton Comics run.
* American Mythology Comics produced a comic book that ran four issues from September 2017 to September 2018. It was followed by a &quot;Halloween ComicFest&quot; one-shot in 2019 and &quot;Underdog in Space&quot; which ran for one issue in 2020. &quot;Underdog: 1975&quot; reprinted comics from the Gold Key Comics run.

===Theme song===
The show is also remembered for its title song, &quot;Underdog&quot;, which was arranged and produced by Robert Weitz, with lyrics by Chester Stover, W. Watts Biggers, Treadwell Covington, and Joseph Harris. Several notable covers of the theme song have been made. The original
song was sung by Robert Ragaini. He explained, &quot;As a struggling singer in New York, I&#x27;d gotten a job singing a theme song for a newly proposed TV cartoon series named &#x27;Underdog&#x27;. I went to the studio, I think &#x27;O.D.O.&#x27; on West 54th Street, sang as part of the backup group (ah-ooo, ah-ooo), then quickly sang the theme song over the track and left. I remember how pleased I was that I&#x27;d taken that mouthful of words and made them understandable. Oh yes, they paid me 50 dollars. No contract I wasn&#x27;t yet a member of SAG and I was thrilled to get it. Until I heard it again, year after year. By then I&#x27;d become a successful jingle singer and I knew what I should have been making. When it came out as the music track of a Reebok commercial I filed a claim with the Screen Actors Guild, but of course I had no documentation. A friend did give me an Underdog T-shirt. I wore it once, but when a man I passed on West 14th Street started singing the song, I retired it.&quot;
* The Butthole Surfers released a version included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.
* Ted Kooshian&#x27;s Standard Orbit Quartet included the song on their 2009 CD &quot;Underdog, And Other Stories...&quot;
* An extended &quot;a cappella&quot; version was done by The Blanks on the TV program &quot;Scrubs&quot; during the episode titled &quot;My Hero&quot;. They later recorded it on their 2004 album &quot;Riding the Wave&quot;.
* The hip hop producer and Wu-Tang Clan member RZA sampled the show&#x27;s theme song in the group&#x27;s 1993 song titled &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#x27;t Nuttin To F&#x27; Wit&quot;, released on their debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;.
* The &quot;Underdog&quot; theme also was used in a commercial for the Reebok ZQuick shoes in 2014.

===VHS releases===
In 1990, generic company UAV Corp. released Underdog in separate episodes, which went out-of-print in 1995. On June 14, 1996, Sony Wonder released &quot;Underdog&quot; on VHS in a four-volume collection. These sets were reissued on the same format on September 12, 2000, as each set, especially the DVD versions, included a coupon for the Underdog lithograph by the series’ creator, Joe Harris.

===DVD releases===
Sony Wonder released &quot;Underdog&quot; Collector’s Edition DVD on September 12, 2000, and again on August 6, 2002. These releases were discontinued in the mid-2000s. On July 24, 2007, Classic Media released &quot;Underdog&quot; on DVD in region 1 in a three-volume collection, following a previous three-volume set released in the late 1990s. Each volume features six digitally remastered and uncut, original broadcast episodes, each featuring two &quot;Underdog&quot; segments alongside additional cartoons from the Total TV library.

On February 21, 2012, Shout! Factory (under license from Classic Media) released a 9-disc Complete Series set containing new bonus material, including commentaries. According to Shout! Factory, &quot;they&#x27;re rebuilding the shows to their original television airing as best as they can&quot;.

===Film adaptation===
In 2005, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that a live-action &quot;Underdog&quot; motion picture was in development. As announced, the story introduces &quot;a diminutive hound named Shoeshine [who] gets superpowers after a lab accident. When he&#x27;s adopted by a 15-year-old boy, the two form a bond around the shared knowledge that Shoeshine is really Underdog.&quot; Actor Peter Dinklage was cast to play Simon Bar Sinister, while Alex Neuberger was cast to play Underdog&#x27;s human companion, Jack Unger. The movie started filming in Providence, Rhode Island, in March 2006 and was released on August 3, 2007. The film was distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Shoeshine/Underdog, voiced by Jason Lee, was played by a golden beagle named Leo sporting a red sweater and a blue cape. The film got mostly negative reviews, but grossed $65.3 million worldwide.

===Radio===
In 1999, Biggers created a new episode of &quot;Underdog&quot; as a half-hour radio show narrated by veteran Boston newsman Tom Ellis with new original music composed by Biggers. Radio stations were asked to participate in Biggers&#x27; Victory Over Violence organization by airing the adventure in which the evil Simon Bar Sinister develops a Switchpitch baseball to turn positive people negative. His attempt to become king of Boston is foiled by Underdog (played by Biggers) and Sweet Polly Purebred (portrayed by Nancy Purbeck).

===Revival===
Instagram artists Elena and Olivia Ceballos revealed they pitched for an Underdog revival back in 2015 to DreamWorks Animation Television, since the parent company owns the Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics since DreamWork’s acquisition of Classic Media in 2012) library, and eventually became part of NBCUniversal since 2016. The pitch included characters who were in the original show, along with some new ones. According to the artists, nothing went forward after the pitch.

As of July 2024, a CGI reboot, separate and entirely different from the Ceballos twins&#x27; pitch, is currently in production from SuperProd Animation and Red Monk Studio, under license from DreamWorks Classics. The series will be released in 2025.

<text>The Bell XP-52 and subsequent XP-59 were World War II fighter aircraft design projects by the American Bell Aircraft Corporation.

Both projects featured a twin-boom layout with a rear-mounted engine driving pusher contra-rotating propellers.

When the XP-59 project was canceled the designation XP-59A was used as a cover for a secret jet fighter prototype, which would enter production as the P-59 Airacomet.

==XP-52==

The XP-52 design was begun by the Bell Company in 1940, separate from the R-40C competition, under the Air Material Command designator MX-3.

The short fuselage carried a piston engine in the rear, driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers in a pusher configuration. The wings were swept back at an angle of 20 degrees, with a horizontal stabilizer mounted behind the propeller on twin booms running back from the wings. The fuselage was unusually streamlined, being round and barrel-shaped, with the forward-located pilot&#x27;s cockpit fully faired-in to its lines and the nose ending in a round air intake which was ducted back internally to the engine. The undercarriage was a tricycle arrangement, with the main wheels retracting into the tailbooms. Propulsion was to be provided by the experimental Continental XIV-1430-3 inverted V-12 engine.

The XP-52 was canceled in October 1940 because the XIV-1430 engine ran into technical difficulties. Bell submitted a similar design to the US Navy as the Model 19, but this too was never built.

==XP-59==
Although generally similar in layout to the XP-52, the XP-59 was slightly larger and heavier, and was to be powered by a Pratt and Whitney R-2800-23 engine of . Two prototypes were ordered in February 1941.

On 3 October 1941 the contract for Bell&#x27;s first jet fighter was signed. The prototype was designated the XP-59A and it would enter production as the P-59 Airacomet. The original XP-59 was canceled on November 25, 1941 because Bell itself was pre-occupied with development of the Bell P-63 Kingcobra.

<doc id="333824" wikidata="Q933932" url="?curid=333824" title="Horn clause">
<text>In mathematical logic and logic programming, a Horn clause is a logical formula of a particular rule-like form that gives it useful properties for use in logic programming, formal specification, universal algebra and model theory. Horn clauses are named for the logician Alfred Horn, who first pointed out their significance in 1951.

== Definition ==

A Horn clause is a disjunctive clause (a disjunction of literals) with at most one positive, i.e. unnegated, literal. 

Conversely, a disjunction of literals with at most one negated literal is called a dual-Horn clause. 

A Horn clause with exactly one positive literal is a definite clause or a strict Horn clause; a definite clause with no negative literals is a unit clause, and a unit clause without variables is a fact;
A Horn clause without a positive literal is a goal clause.
The empty clause, consisting of no literals (which is equivalent to &quot;false&quot;) is a goal clause.
These three kinds of Horn clauses are illustrated in the following propositional example:
All variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified with the scope being the entire clause. Thus, for example:

:¬ &quot;human&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ∨ &quot;mortal&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)

stands for:

:∀X( ¬ &quot;human&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ∨ &quot;mortal&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ),

which is logically equivalent to:

:∀X ( &quot;human&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → &quot;mortal&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ).

===Significance===
Horn clauses play a basic role in constructive logic and computational logic. They are important in automated theorem proving by first-order resolution, because the resolvent of two Horn clauses is itself a Horn clause, and the resolvent of a goal clause and a definite clause is a goal clause. These properties of Horn clauses can lead to greater efficiency of proving a theorem: the goal clause is the negation of this theorem; see &quot;Goal clause&quot; in the above table. Intuitively, if we wish to prove φ, we assume ¬φ (the goal) and check whether such assumption leads to a contradiction. If so, then φ must hold. This way, a mechanical proving tool needs to maintain only one set of formulas (assumptions), rather than two sets (assumptions and (sub)goals).

Propositional Horn clauses are also of interest in computational complexity. The problem of finding truth-value assignments to make a conjunction of propositional Horn clauses true is known as HORNSAT.
This problem is P-complete and solvable in linear time. In contrast, the unrestricted Boolean satisfiability problem is an NP-complete problem.

In universal algebra, definite Horn clauses are generally called quasi-identities; classes of algebras definable by a set of quasi-identities 
are called quasivarieties and enjoy some of the good properties of the more restrictive notion of a variety, i.e., an equational class. From the model-theoretical point of view, Horn sentences are important since they are exactly (up to logical equivalence) those sentences preserved under reduced products; in particular, they are preserved under direct products. On the other hand, there are sentences that are not Horn but are nevertheless preserved under arbitrary direct products.

==Logic programming==

Horn clauses are also the basis of logic programming, where it is common to write definite clauses in the form of an implication:

:(&quot;p&quot; ∧ &quot;q&quot; ∧ ... ∧ &quot;t&quot;) → &quot;u&quot;

In fact, the resolution of a goal clause with a definite clause to produce a new goal clause is the basis of the SLD resolution inference rule, used in implementation of the logic programming language Prolog.

In logic programming, a definite clause behaves as a goal-reduction procedure. For example, the Horn clause written above behaves as the procedure:

:to show &quot;u&quot;, show &quot;p&quot; and show &quot;q&quot; and ... and show &quot;t&quot;.

To emphasize this reverse use of the clause, it is often written in the reverse form:

:&quot;u&quot; ← (&quot;p&quot; ∧ &quot;q&quot; ∧ ... ∧ &quot;t&quot;)

In Prolog this is written as:

u :- p, q, ..., t.

In logic programming, a goal clause, which has the logical form

:∀&quot;X&quot; (&quot;false&quot; ← &quot;p&quot; ∧ &quot;q&quot; ∧ ... ∧ &quot;t&quot;)

represents the negation of a problem to be solved. The problem itself is an existentially quantified conjunction of positive literals:

:∃&quot;X&quot; (&quot;p&quot; ∧ &quot;q&quot; ∧ ... ∧ &quot;t&quot;)

The Prolog notation does not have explicit quantifiers and is written in the form:

:- p, q, ..., t.

This notation is ambiguous in the sense that it can be read either as a statement of the problem or as a statement of the denial of the problem. However, both readings are correct. In both cases, solving the problem amounts to deriving the empty clause. In Prolog notation this is equivalent to deriving:
:- true.

If the top-level goal clause is read as the denial of the problem, then the empty clause represents &quot;false&quot; and the proof of the empty clause is a refutation of the denial of the problem. If the top-level goal clause is read as the problem itself, then the empty clause represents &quot;true&quot;, and the proof of the empty clause is a proof that the problem has a solution. 

The solution of the problem is a substitution of terms for the variables &quot;X&quot; in the top-level goal clause, which can be extracted from the resolution proof. Used in this way, goal clauses are similar to conjunctive queries in relational databases, and Horn clause logic is equivalent in computational power to a universal Turing machine. 

Van Emden and Kowalski (1976) investigated the model-theoretic properties of Horn clauses in the context of logic programming, showing that every set of definite clauses D has a unique minimal model M. An atomic formula A is logically implied by D if and only if A is true in M. It follows that a problem P represented by an existentially quantified conjunction of positive literals is logically implied by D if and only if P is true in M. The minimal model semantics of Horn clauses is the basis for the stable model semantics of logic programs.

<text>George Herbert Mead (February 27, 1863 – April 26, 1931) was an American philosopher, sociologist, and psychologist, primarily affiliated with the University of Chicago. He was one of the key figures in the development of pragmatism. He is regarded as one of the founders of symbolic interactionism, and was an important influence on what has come to be referred to as the Chicago School of Sociology.

== Biography ==
George Herbert Mead was born on February 27, 1863, in South Hadley, Massachusetts. He was raised in a Protestant, middle-class family comprising his father, Hiram Mead, his mother, Elizabeth Storrs Mead (née Billings), and his sister Alice. His father was a former Congregationalist pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology at Oberlin College&#x27;s theological seminary. Elizabeth taught for two years at Oberlin College and subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, served as president of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.

In 1879, George Mead enrolled at the Oberlin Academy at Oberlin College and then the college itself, graduating in 1883 with a Bachelor of Arts. After graduation, Mead taught grade school for about four months. From the end of 1883 through the summer of 1887, he worked as a surveyor for the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company.

In autumn 1887, Mead enrolled at Harvard University, where his main interests were philosophy and psychology. At Harvard, Mead studied with Josiah Royce, a major influence upon his thought, and William James, whose children he tutored. In 1888, Mead left Harvard after receiving only a B.A. and moved to Leipzig, Germany to study with psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, from whom he learned the concept of &quot;the gesture&quot;, which would become central to his later work.

In 1891, Mead married Helen Kingsbury Castle (1860–1929), the sister of Henry Northrup Castle (1862–1895), a friend he met at Oberlin.
Despite never finishing his dissertation, Mead was able to obtain a post at the University of Michigan in 1891. There, Mead met Charles Horton Cooley and John Dewey, both of whom would influence him greatly. In 1894, Mead moved, along with Dewey, to the University of Chicago, where he taught until his death. Dewey&#x27;s influence led Mead into educational theory, but his thinking soon diverged from that of Dewey, and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind, self and society.

He was active in Chicago&#x27;s social and political affairs; his many activities include work for the City Club of Chicago. Mead believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in Chicago. He also worked as treasurer for Chicago&#x27;s Hull House. He also collaborated closely with Jane Addams on matters of social justice.

Mead died of heart failure on April 26, 1931.

== Theory ==

=== Pragmatism and symbolic interactionism ===

Much of Mead&#x27;s work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm: he insisted that &quot;the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings&quot;. The two most important roots of Mead&#x27;s work, and of symbolic interactionism in general, are the philosophy of &quot;pragmatism&quot; and &quot;social&quot; &quot;behaviorism&quot;.

Social behaviorism (as opposed to psychological behaviorism) refers to Mead&#x27;s concern of the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings, rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli. Mead was a critic of John B. Watson&#x27;s form of behaviorism.

Pragmatism is a wide-ranging philosophical position from which several aspects of Mead&#x27;s influences can be identified into four main tenets:

# True reality does not exist &quot;out there&quot; in the real world, it &quot;is actively created as we act in and toward the world&quot;. 
# People remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer &quot;works&quot;.
# People define the social and physical &quot;objects&quot; they encounter in the world according to their use for them.
# If we want to understand actors, we must base that understanding on what people actually do.

Three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism:

*the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world;
*a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures; and
*the actor&#x27;s ability to interpret the social world.

Thus, to Mead and symbolic interactionists, consciousness is not separated from action and interaction, but is an integral part of both. Symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of &quot;transactionalism&quot;. Mead&#x27;s theories in part, based on pragmatism and behaviorism, were transmitted to many graduate students at the University of Chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism.

=== Social philosophy (social behaviorism) ===
Mead was a very important figure in 20th-century social philosophy. One of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms, discussed in &quot;Mind, Self and Society&quot; (1934)&quot;,&quot; also known as &quot;social behaviorism&quot;. This concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology.

Rooted intellectually in Hegelian dialectics and process philosophy, Mead, like John Dewey, developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action. Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including communicative activity, is the means through which our sense of self is constituted. The essence of Mead&#x27;s social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure. This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body. The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behaviorthat is, thought. Mind, in Mead&#x27;s terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process. It is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual. There is, then, no &quot;mind or thought without language&quot;; and language (the content of mind) &quot;is only a development and product of social interaction&quot;. Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in &quot;the dynamic, ongoing social process&quot; that constitutes human experience.

For Mead, mind arises out of the social act of communication. Mead&#x27;s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind, but to all facets of his social philosophy. His theory of &quot;mind, self, and society&quot; is, in effect, a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals, just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment. Action is very important to his social theory and, according to Mead, actions also occur within a communicative process.

The initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture. A &quot;gesture&quot; is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism. The rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures, in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second, and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person. On this level no communication occurs. Neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other; the gestures are nonsignificant. For communication to take place, each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to its own ongoing act. Here the gestures are significant symbols. A &quot;significant symbol&quot; is a kind of gesture that only humans can make. Gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed. Only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication. Mead grounded human perception in an &quot;action-nexus&quot;. We perceive the world in terms of the &quot;means of living.&quot; To perceive food is to perceive eating. To perceive a house is to perceive shelter. That is to say, perception is in terms of action. Mead&#x27;s theory of perception is similar to that of J. J. Gibson.

==== Social acts ====
Mead argued, in tune with Durkheim, that the individual is a product of an ongoing, pre-existing society; or, more specifically, of social interaction that is a consequence of a &quot;sui generis&quot; society. The &quot;self&quot; arises when the individual becomes an object to themself. Mead argued that we are objects first to other people, and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people. Language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people, and thus through language we become other to ourselves. In joint activity, which Mead called &quot;social acts&quot;, humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their co-actors. A central mechanism within the social act, which enables perspective taking, is position exchange. People within a social act often alternate social positions (e.g., giving/receiving, asking/helping, winning/losing, hiding/seeking, talking/listening). In children&#x27;s games there is repeated position exchange, for example in hide-and-seek, and Mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops.

However, for Mead, unlike Dewey and J. J. Gibson, the key is not simply human action, but rather social action. In humans the &quot;manipulatory phase of the act&quot; is socially mediated; that is to say, in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others toward that object. This is what Mead means by &quot;the social act&quot; as opposed to simply &quot;the act&quot; (the latter being a Deweyan concept). Non-human animals also manipulate objects, but that is a non-social manipulation; they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object. Humans, on the other hand, take the perspective of other actors towards objects, and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination. In the social act of economic exchange, for example, both buyer and seller must take each other&#x27;s perspectives toward the object being exchanged. The seller must recognize the value for the buyer, while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller. Only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur. (Mead was influenced on this point by Adam Smith.)

===Nature of the self===

A final piece of Mead&#x27;s social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process. Mead states that &quot;the self is a social process&quot;, meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate one&#x27;s complete self. As previously discussed, Mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process. As &quot;gestures&quot; are taken in by the individual organism, the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others, in the form of gestures, and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes. This process is characterized by Mead as the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;Me&quot;. The &#x27;Me&#x27; is the social self and the &#x27;I&#x27; is the response to the &#x27;Me&#x27;. In other words, the &#x27;I&#x27; is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others, while the &#x27;Me&#x27; is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes.

Mead develops William James&#x27; distinction between the &#x27;I&#x27; and the &#x27;Me&#x27;. The &#x27;Me&#x27; is the accumulated understanding of &quot;the generalized otheri.e., how one thinks one&#x27;s group perceives oneself, and so on. The &#x27;I&#x27; is the individual&#x27;s impulses. The &#x27;I&#x27; is &quot;self as subject&quot;; the &#x27;Me&#x27; is &quot;self as object&quot;. The &#x27;I&#x27; is the knower; the &#x27;Me&#x27; is the known. The mind, or stream of thought, is the self-reflective movements of the interaction between the &#x27;I&#x27; and the &#x27;Me&#x27;. There is neither &#x27;I&#x27; nor &#x27;Me&#x27; in the conversation of gestures; the whole act is not yet carried out, but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture. These dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense, and form the basis of a theory of human cognition. For Mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the &#x27;I&#x27; and the &#x27;Me&#x27;. Mead rooted the self&#x27;s &quot;perception and meaning&quot; deeply and sociologically in &quot;a common praxis of subjects&quot;, found specifically in social encounters.

Understood as a combination of the &#x27;I&#x27; and the &#x27;Me&#x27;, Mead&#x27;s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence. For Mead, existence in community comes before individual consciousness. First one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become &quot;&#x27;conscious&quot;&#x27;.

===Philosophy of science===
Mead was a major American philosopher by virtue of beingalong with John Dewey, Charles Peirce and William James one of the founders of pragmatism. He also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature, science, and history, to philosophical anthropology, and to process philosophy. Dewey and Alfred North Whitehead considered Mead a thinker of the first rank. He is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries.

In his work on philosophy of science, Mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment. The notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience. There is a social relation to inanimate objects, for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly, or that it manipulates indirectly in perception. For example, in taking (introjecting or imitating) the resistant role of a solid object, an individual obtains cognition of what is &quot;inside&quot; nonliving things. Historically, the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe.

Contact experience includes experiences of position, balance, and support, and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world. Our scientific concepts of space, time, and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience. Such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation. In developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature. The conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience, rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing, is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement. In the scientific worldview, immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs. The ultimate in experience, however, is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act.

=== Play and game and the generalized other ===
Mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through &quot;play&quot; and &quot;game&quot;. &quot;Play&quot; comes first in the child&#x27;s development. The child takes different roles that he/she observes in &quot;adult&quot; society, and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles. For instance, a child may first play the role of police officer and then the role of thief while playing &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;, and play the roles of doctor and patient when playing &quot;Doctor&quot;. As a result of such play, the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self. However, it is a limited self, because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others; they still lack a more general and organized sense of themself.

In the next stage, the &quot;game&quot; stage, it is required that a person develop a full sense of self. Whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others, in the game stage the child must take on the role of everyone else involved in the game. Furthermore, these roles must have a definite relationship to one another. To illustrate the game stage, Mead gives his famous example of a baseball game:

In the game stage, organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge. Children begin to become able to function in organized groups and, most importantly, to determine what they will do within a specific group. Mead calls this the child&#x27;s first encounter with &quot;the generalized other&quot;, which is one of the main concepts that Mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the (social) self in human beings. &quot;The generalized other&quot; can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors&#x27; place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity. Through understanding &quot;the generalized other&quot;, the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected, appropriate and so on, in different social settings.

Some may find that social acts (e.g. games and routine forms of social interaction) enable perspective taking through &quot;position exchange&quot;. Assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions, and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives, then it might be that by moving between roles in a game (e.g. between hiding and seeking or buying and selling) we come to learn about the perspective of the other. This new interpretation of Mead&#x27;s account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support. Other recent publications argue that Mead&#x27;s account of the development of perspective taking is relevant not only with respect to human ontogeny but also to the evolution of human sociality.

== Writings ==
In a career spanning more than 40 years, Mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology. However, he did not publish any books. Following his death, several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of Mead&#x27;s social psychology course at the University of Chicago, his lecture notes (Mead&#x27;s Carus Lectures, 1930, edited by Charles W. Morris), and his numerous unpublished papers.

In his lifetime, Mead published around 100 scholarly articles, reviews, and incidental pieces. Given their diverse nature, access to these writings is difficult. The first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the 1960s. In 1964, Andrew J. Reck collected twenty-five of Mead&#x27;s published articles in &quot;Selected Writings: George Herbert Mead&quot;. Four years later, John W. Petras published &quot;George Herbert Mead: Essays on his Social Psychology&quot;, a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts.

More recently, Mary Jo Deegan (2001) published &quot;Essays in Social Psychology&quot;, a book project originally abandoned by Mead in the early 1910s. In 2010, Filipe Carreira da Silva edited &quot;G.H. Mead. A Reader&quot;, a comprehensive collection including thirty of Mead&#x27;s most important articles, ten of them previously unpublished. Likewise, the Mead Project at Brock University in Toronto intends to publish all of Mead&#x27;s 80-odd remaining unpublished manuscripts.

<doc id="333830" wikidata="Q3139681" url="?curid=333830" title="Barting Over">
<text>&quot;Barting Over&quot; is the eleventh episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, advertised by Fox, and indicated on-screen to be the 300th episode of the show (though in broadcast order, it is the 302nd episode, as noted in the episode proper, and the 301st episode in production order). It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 2003. The episode was written by Andrew Kreisberg and directed by Matthew Nastuk.

In this episode, Bart discovers that he used to be a child star in commercials—and that Homer spent all the money he earned. In retaliation, Bart petitions the court to be legally emancipated, and he moves out of the house. The band Blink-182 and skateboarder Tony Hawk appeared as themselves. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
While Bart and Lisa are cleaning the garage, they find a commercial where Bart is cast as a baby with bad breath. Bart does not remember being a child actor (stating he doesn&#x27;t remember being in &quot;any&quot; commercial, before eating a Butterfinger candy bar), and Marge reassures him that he earned a lot of money from it. Homer confesses that he had spent Bart&#x27;s money. When he asks why Homer would be so selfish in doing so since Marge promised to put that in a trust fund for his future, he explains that he needed the money. Homer had to buy back incriminating photos of himself endangering Bart&#x27;s life from a hotel balcony to avoid a scandal. Furious, Bart decides that he can no longer live with Homer and appeals to be emancipated.

During the trial, Homer&#x27;s anger issues prove that Bart is not safe living with him, and Homer is no longer his legal guardian. Furious, he tries to attack Judge Harm, but is stopped by the bailiff and dragged away for contempt.

Bart sadly says goodbye to Marge and Lisa, then moves into a loft. Homer struggles to cope with Bart&#x27;s disappearance and plans to prove that he can be a better father. That night, Bart is scared away by a rat and runs into the elevator, which takes him to the hangout of Tony Hawk and Blink-182. He befriends Hawk and decorates his loft with luxuries, and when the rest of the family visit him, Bart prefers his new life and still refuses to come back.

Hawk invites Bart to his Skewed Tour, where Homer, Lisa, and Marge follow him. To win back Bart&#x27;s respect, Homer beats Hawk in a skateboarding duel. After Homer promises that he will never mistreat him again, Bart accepts his apology and moves back in. Homer starts to earn back Bart&#x27;s money by acting in an advertisement for an impotency drug and which he&#x27;s embarrassed of. Bart reassures him that no one will remember it in 50 years. On Homer&#x27;s death 50 years later, an elderly Nelson Muntz laughs at his grave before coughing from the attempt.

==Production==
FOX insisted that the 300th episode be scheduled specifically on February 16, 2003 so that there was time to plan a huge promotion for the episode. However, the actual 300th episode had already aired two weeks prior. This was referenced in this episode during a joke where Lisa tallies the number of Homer&#x27;s schemes at 300; Marge comments &quot;I could&#x27;ve sworn it was 302.&quot;

Blink-182 recorded their lines for the episode on April 24, 2002; Tony Hawk recorded his five days later on April 29. Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 has stated that being on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was &quot;truly one of those &#x27;wow, this is unreal&#x27; moments that I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to experience. It still makes my day every time I think about it.&quot;

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode earned a 10.7 rating and was watched by 21.31 million viewers, which was 15th highest rated show that week.

===Critical response===
In 2007, Simon Crerar of &quot;The Times&quot; listed Tony Hawk&#x27;s performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.

In 2011, Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said the episode seems dated due to the appearance of Blink-182 and Tony Hawk, who were popular in the early 2000s. He also thought the episode &quot;isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s ordinary.&quot;

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando also thought the guest stars were reflective of the early 2000s. They enjoyed the episode and liked the premise of Bart tiring of Homer&#x27;s treatment of him.

In 2023, Tony Sokol of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; named the episode the 9th best episode of the series from the 2000s. He called it &quot;one of the most callous entries in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; canon&quot; for having Homer waste the money intended for Bart. He also thought &quot;[t]he episode comes together&quot; with the appearances by Blink-182 and Tony Hawk.

<doc id="333835" wikidata="Q5500272" url="?curid=333835" title="Free object">
<text>In mathematics, the idea of a free object is one of the basic concepts of abstract algebra. Informally, a free object over a set &quot;A&quot; can be thought of as being a &quot;generic&quot; algebraic structure over &quot;A&quot;: the only equations that hold between elements of the free object are those that follow from the defining axioms of the algebraic structure. Examples include free groups, tensor algebras, or free lattices.

The concept is a part of universal algebra, in the sense that it relates to all types of algebraic structure (with finitary operations). It also has a formulation in terms of category theory, although this is in yet more abstract terms.

==Definition==

Free objects are the direct generalization to categories of the notion of basis in a vector space. A linear function between vector spaces is entirely determined by its values on a basis of the vector space The following definition translates this to any category.

A concrete category is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to Set, the category of sets. Let be a concrete category with a faithful functor . Let be a set (that is, an object in Set), which will be the &quot;basis&quot; of the free object to be defined. A free object on is a pair consisting of an object formula_1 in and an injection formula_2 (called the &quot;canonical injection&quot;), that satisfies the following universal property:
:For any object in and any map between sets formula_3, there exists a unique morphism formula_4 in such that formula_5. That is, the following diagram commutes:

If free objects exist in , the universal property implies every map between two sets induces a unique morphism between the free objects built on them, and this defines a functor formula_6. It follows that, if free objects exist in , the functor , called the free functor is a left adjoint to the faithful functor ; that is, there is a bijection
:formula_7

==Examples==
The creation of free objects proceeds in two steps. For algebras that conform to the associative law, the first step is to consider the collection of all possible words formed from an alphabet. Then one imposes a set of equivalence relations upon the words, where the relations are the defining relations of the algebraic object at hand. The free object then consists of the set of equivalence classes.

Consider, for example, the construction of the free group in two generators. One starts with an alphabet consisting of the five letters formula_8. In the first step, there is not yet any assigned meaning to the &quot;letters&quot; formula_9 or formula_10; these will be given later, in the second step. Thus, one could equally well start with the alphabet in five letters that is formula_11. In this example, the set of all words or strings formula_12 will include strings such as &quot;aebecede&quot; and &quot;abdc&quot;, and so on, of arbitrary finite length, with the letters arranged in every possible order.

In the next step, one imposes a set of equivalence relations. The equivalence relations for a group are that of multiplication by the identity, formula_13, and the multiplication of inverses: formula_14. Applying these relations to the strings above, one obtains

:formula_15

where it was understood that formula_16 is a stand-in for formula_9, and formula_18 is a stand-in for formula_10, while formula_20 is the identity element. Similarly, one has

:formula_21

Denoting the equivalence relation or congruence by formula_22, the free object is then the collection of equivalence classes of words. Thus, in this example, the free group in two generators is the quotient

:formula_23

This is often written as formula_24 where formula_25 is the set of all words, and formula_26 is the equivalence class of the identity, after the relations defining a group are imposed.

A simpler example are the free monoids. The free monoid on a set &quot;X&quot;, is the monoid of all finite strings using &quot;X&quot; as alphabet, with operation concatenation of strings. The identity is the empty string. In essence, the free monoid is simply the set of all words, with no equivalence relations imposed. This example is developed further in the article on the Kleene star.

===General case===
In the general case, the algebraic relations need not be associative, in which case the starting point is not the set of all words, but rather, strings punctuated with parentheses, which are used to indicate the non-associative groupings of letters. Such a string may equivalently be represented by a binary tree or a free magma; the leaves of the tree are the letters from the alphabet.

The algebraic relations may then be general arities or finitary relations on the leaves of the tree. Rather than starting with the collection of all possible parenthesized strings, it can be more convenient to start with the Herbrand universe. Properly describing or enumerating the contents of a free object can be easy or difficult, depending on the particular algebraic object in question. For example, the free group in two generators is easily described. By contrast, little or nothing is known about the structure of free Heyting algebras in more than one generator. The problem of determining if two different strings belong to the same equivalence class is known as the word problem.

As the examples suggest, free objects look like constructions from syntax; one may reverse that to some extent by saying that major uses of syntax can be explained and characterised as free objects, in a way that makes apparently heavy &#x27;punctuation&#x27; explicable (and more memorable).

==Free universal algebras==

Let formula_27 be a set and formula_1 be an algebraic structure of type formula_29 generated by formula_27. The underlying set of this algebraic structure formula_1, often called its universe, is denoted by formula_1 . Let formula_33 be a function. We say that formula_34 (or informally just formula_1) is a free algebra of type formula_29 on the set formula_27 of free generators if the following universal property holds:

For every algebra formula_38 of type formula_29 and every function formula_40, where formula_38 is the universe of formula_38, there exists a unique homomorphism formula_43 such that the following diagram commutes:

formula_44

This means that formula_45.

==Free functor==
The most general setting for a free object is in category theory, where one defines a functor, the free functor, that is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor.

Consider a category C of algebraic structures; the objects can be thought of as sets plus operations, obeying some laws. This category has a functor, formula_46, the forgetful functor, which maps objects and morphisms in C to Set, the category of sets. The forgetful functor is very simple: it just ignores all of the operations.

The free functor &quot;F&quot;, when it exists, is the left adjoint to &quot;U&quot;. That is, formula_47 takes sets &quot;X&quot; in Set to their corresponding free objects &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) in the category C. The set &quot;X&quot; can be thought of as the set of &quot;generators&quot; of the free object &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

For the free functor to be a left adjoint, one must also have a Set-morphism formula_48. More explicitly, &quot;F&quot; is, up to isomorphisms in C, characterized by the following universal property:
:Whenever is an algebra in , and formula_49 is a function (a morphism in the category of sets), then there is a unique -morphism formula_50 such that formula_51.

Concretely, this sends a set into the free object on that set; it is the &quot;inclusion of a basis&quot;. Abusing notation, formula_52 (this abuses notation because &quot;X&quot; is a set, while &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is an algebra; correctly, it is formula_53).

The natural transformation formula_54 is called the unit; together with the counit formula_55, one may construct a T-algebra, and so a monad.

The cofree functor is the right adjoint to the forgetful functor.

===Existence===
There are general existence theorems that apply; the most basic of them guarantees that 
:Whenever C is a variety, then for every set &quot;X&quot; there is a free object &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) in C.

Here, a variety is a synonym for a finitary algebraic category, thus implying that the set of relations are finitary, and &quot;algebraic&quot; because it is monadic over Set.

===General case===
Other types of forgetfulness also give rise to objects quite like free objects, in that they are left adjoint to a forgetful functor, not necessarily to sets.

For example, the tensor algebra construction on a vector space is the left adjoint to the functor on associative algebras that ignores the algebra structure. It is therefore often also called a free algebra. Likewise the symmetric algebra and exterior algebra are free symmetric and anti-symmetric algebras on a vector space.

<text>Quirino Cristiani (2 July 1896 – 2 August 1984) was an Italian-born Argentine animation director and cartoonist, responsible for the world&#x27;s first two animated feature films as well as the first animated feature film with sound, even though the only copies of these two films were lost in a fire. He is also the first person to create animation solely using cardboard cutouts.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Quirino Cristiani was born on July 2, 1896, in Santa Giuletta, Italy. His family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1900, and Quirino spent his childhood soaking up the fast pace and left-leaning politics of the great southern metropolis. He came to consider himself a &quot;porteño&quot; first (as the natives of the port of Buenos Aires called themselves) and an Argentine second.

As a teenager, he developed a passion for drawing, which led him through a brief course with the Academy of Fine Arts to the publication of political caricatures for the city newspapers. Soon the perfect target for his satire presented himself.

===Career===
====El Ápostol====
The national elections of 1916 peacefully ended the 36-year-long rule of the Conservative party and placed Radical party leader Hipólito Yrigoyen in the president&#x27;s seat. Yrigoyen favored the lower middle class, especially in Buenos Aires, and granted unprecedented freedom to the press. The press in response turned on him, mocking his social awkwardness, his replacement of Conservative corruption with Radical corruption in the government, and his decision to keep Argentina out of World War I, a decision that was unpopular with the germanophile Argentine military. He soon was dubbed &quot;Peludo&quot; (&quot;Armadillo&quot;) for his reclusive personality, always seeking the security of his &quot;lair&quot;.

Living in the capital was another Italian immigrant, Federico Valle, once a cameraman and director in Europe who had used Wilbur Wright&#x27;s visit to Rome in 1909 as the opportunity to film the world&#x27;s first aerial cinematography, now a producer of newsreels for his adopted country. Valle was apolitical, but he knew the porteños were not. He hired the twenty-year-old Cristiani off the street, gave him Émile Cohl&#x27;s &quot;Les Allumettes animées&quot; (&quot;Animated Matches&quot;, 1908) to teach him the technique, and set him loose. Before 1916 was out, Valle&#x27;s newsreel &quot;Actualides Valle&quot; came out with an episode including the one-minute cartoon &quot;La Intervención en la provincia de Buenos Aires&quot; (&quot;Intervention in the Province of Buenos Aires&quot;) by Quirino Cristiani. The cartoon was about Yrigoyen&#x27;s ouster of Buenos Aires governor Marcelino Ugarte for dishonesty. This film used cardboard cutouts as the form of animation, a choice Cristiani would stick with throughout his career.
This short film did surprisingly well, and Valle announced a new project: the green animator would next create the world&#x27;s first feature-length animated film, with President Yrigoyen as the subject. The funding would come from a Mr. Franchini, who owned a chain of movie theatres to show the finished film. Cristiani would get his character designs from newspaper cartoonist Diógenes Taborda (pen name &quot;El Mono&quot;, &quot;The Monkey&quot;). Cristiani, doing the lion&#x27;s share of the animation, managed to accomplish his goal -- the 58,000-frame &quot;El Apóstol&quot;: an hour and ten minutes at 14 frames per second, the film premiered on November 9, 1917 and was destroyed in 1926.

The movie was a satire, with President Yrigoyen ascending to the heavens to use Jupiter&#x27;s thunderbolts to cleanse Buenos Aires of immorality and corruption. The result is a burnt city. The film was well-received, but most of the praise went to producer Valle, with what was left over going to Taborda.

====Leaving No Trace====
In 1918, the German commander in Argentina, Baron von Luxburg, decided to manipulate Argentina into joining World War I on its side by sinking an Argentine ship and blaming the act on the Entente. The tales of the survivors of the incident led nearly everyone to realize what really happened, but Yrigoyen swung his political weight to cover the incident up, out of fear that Argentina might be pushed into the war as an enemy of Germany, an outcome he feared just as much as a German alliance.

Cristiani saw the incident as the perfect opportunity, and with a new set of producers created the world&#x27;s second feature-length animated film, &quot;Sin dejar rastros&quot; in 1918. The title (&quot;Leaving No Trace&quot;) was a reference to von Luxburg&#x27;s supposed order to the German U-boat captain who sank the ship. President Yrigoyen felt he had no choice but to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to confiscate the film the day after it premiered. In doing this, the Radical showed himself little better than the repressive Conservative presidents he had replaced. On the other hand, Cristiani was not imprisoned and spent the next several years creating political cartoons and caricatures for the newspapers. Two other animated features were put out at this time by Andrés Ducaud, the man who designed the fire effects in &quot;El Apóstol&quot;.

To support his growing family, Cristiani founded the advertising company Publi-Cinema, where he made short commercial cartoons. To show these cartoons, he traveled to the poorer parts of town, where no movie theatres were to be found, and showed the paying public Chaplin shorts and other films interspersed with his animation. This did so well that the police shut him down for &quot;disturbing the peace and interrupting traffic&quot;.

President &quot;Peludo&quot; finished out his six-year term in 1922, and was succeeded by another Radical, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. During Alvear&#x27;s presidency, Cristiani started making animated shorts for entertainment purposes. Some of the titles included &quot;Firpo-Dempsey&quot; (1923) on the boxing match between American heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey and Argentinian champion Luis Firpo, &quot;Uruguayos Forever&quot; (1924) on Uruguay&#x27;s Olympic gold medal in soccer, and &quot;Humberto de garufa&quot; (&quot;Little Umberto&#x27;s Folic&quot;, 1924), on the visit of Italian Prince Umberto of Savoy to Buenos Aires. In 1918 and 1926, a fire destroyed Federico Valle&#x27;s film vaults; among the films lost forever was &quot;El Apóstol&quot;.

====Peludópolis====
In 1928, the aging Hipólito Yrigoyen was re-elected president of Argentina. Cristiani felt that the man was too dominated by the corrupt leaders of the Radical party. With a script by Eduardo Gonzalez Lanuza, he set out to make his third animated feature film, &quot;Peludópolis&quot;. The movie was to be a sort of fable, with pirate Yrigoyen&#x27;s floating &quot;Peludo City&quot; (Argentina) beset by hungry sharks (the Radicals). Cristiani converted the operation over to sound partway through, including a few songs in the soundtrack; he used the primitive sound-on-disc system for the recording since it was unlikely that most Argentine theaters would be able to handle sound-on-film at the time of release. Then, on September 6, 1930, a year into production, work on &quot;Peludópolis&quot; was halted when President Yrigoyen was ousted by a Conservative military coup d&#x27;état. With so much invested in the film so far, Cristiani decided to proceed, re-arranging the plot to de-emphasize Yrigoyen and the sharks, and carefully adding the characters of the generals as the heroes, in an attempt to protect himself from possible persecution. He then added an everyman character named Juan Pueblo, to become the moral centre of the film. With the provisional blessing of the provisional ruler of Argentina, General José Félix Uriburu, Cristiani premiered the film on September 16, 1931.

===Later life===
After the death of Yrigoyen, Cristiani withdrew the film from circulation.

Unable to compete with Disney, which had better technology and budgetary capacity, Studios Cristiani was converted into a dubbing/subbing lab.

Cristiani made three more animated films in his life, none of which gained much recognition. When Walt Disney came to Argentina as part of his Latin America research tour, Cristiani showed his films to him, then sent him to cartoonist Molina Campos, the source of the gaucho segment in &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1943). 

Cristiani has been called &quot;The man who anticipated Disney.&quot; Two fires in 1957 and 1961 destroyed the majority of Cristiani&#x27;s work, including the only prints of &quot;Peludópolis&quot;.

He died in Bernal, Argentina on August 2, 1984.

<doc id="333842" wikidata="Q2351545" url="?curid=333842" title="Old German Baptist Brethren">
<text>The Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB) is a Schwarzenau Brethren denomination of Anabaptist Christianity. 

It emerged from a division among the Schwarzenau Brethren in 1881 and is aligned with Old Order Anabaptism. The Schwarzenau Brethren tradition has roots in Anabaptism, as well as in the Radical Pietist revival. 

The Old German Baptist Brethren practices believer&#x27;s baptism as the biblically valid form of baptism. It is also characterized by strict religious adherence with rejection of modern culture and modern assimilation. It teaches plain dress. It is one of several Schwarzenau Brethren groups that trace their roots to 1708, when eight believers founded a new church in Schwarzenau, Germany. The Old German Baptist Brethren church has about 4,000 baptized members.

==Names==
The Old German Baptist Brethren are historically known as German Baptists in contrast to English Baptists, who have different roots. Other names by which they are sometimes identified are &quot;Dunkers, Dunkards, Tunkers&quot;, and &quot;Täufer&quot;, all relating to their practice of baptism by immersion. Originally known as &quot;Neu-Täufer&quot; (new Baptists), in America they used the name &quot;German Baptist&quot; and officially adopted the title &quot;German Baptist Brethren&quot; at their Annual Meeting in 1871. From their formation in 1881 and until the early 1900s the Old German Baptist Brethren were often referred to as &quot;Old Order German Baptist Brethren&quot;. There are several different Brethren groups that are not related to the Schwarzenau movement, such as the Plymouth Brethren that arose in England and Ireland early in the 19th century through the labors of Edward Cronin and John Nelson Darby. However, the teachings of Darby, called Dispensationalism, have been influential among some in the Old German Baptist Brethren.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The Schwarzenau Brethren were first organized in 1708 under the leadership of Alexander Mack (1679–1735) in Schwarzenau, Germany, now part of Bad Berleburg in North Rhine-Westphalia. In August of the same year, five men, including Mack, and three women gathered at the Eder, a small river that flows through Schwarzenau, to perform baptism as an outward symbol of their new interpretation of the faith. One of the members of the group first baptized Mack, who then, in turn, baptized the other seven. Mack along with the seven others believed that the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed churches were taking extreme liberties with the true message of Christianity revealed in the New Testament, so they rejected state-church unions, use of force and violence, and the established liturgy, including infant baptism and existing Eucharistic practices. The founding Brethren were broadly influenced by Radical Pietist understandings of an invisible, nondenominational church of awakened Christians who would fellowship together in equality, purity, and love, following Jesus while awaiting Christ&#x27;s return.

A notable influence was Ernest Christopher Hochmann von Hochenau, a traveling Pietist minister. While living in Schriesheim, his hometown, Mack invited Hochmann to come and minister there. Like others who influenced the Brethren, Hochmann considered the pure church to be spiritual and did not believe that a highly organized church was necessary. By 1708, the date of the first Brethren baptisms, Mack had rejected this position in favor of forming a separate church with visible rules and ordinances—including threefold baptism by immersion, a three-part Love Feast (that combined communion with feet washing and an evening meal), anointing, and use of Church discipline steps as instructed in Matthew 18, culminating with the &quot;ban&quot; against wayward members.

Religious persecution drove the Brethren to take refuge in Friesland, Netherlands. In 1719 Peter Becker led a group to settle in Pennsylvania. In 1720 forty Brethren families settled in Surhuisterveen in Friesland. They lived among the Mennonites there, remaining until 1729, when all but a handful emigrated to America in three separate groups from 1719 to 1733. By 1740, nearly all of the &quot;Schwarzenau&quot; Brethren had relocated to Pennsylvania and they ceased to exist as an organized group in Europe.

Peter Becker organized the first American congregation at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1723. In 1743 Christopher Sauer, an early preacher and a printer, printed a Bible in German, the first published in a European language in North America.

===Early schisms===
The first schism from the general body of German Baptist Brethren occurred in 1728, but more followed after the American Revolution, as different groups sought their own ways. The first separatists became the Seventh Day Dunker Brethren, whose distinctive principle was that they believed that Saturday was still the true Sabbath. They were founded by Conrad Beissel (1690–1768).

In 1732 Beissel led the establishment of a semi-monastic community with a convent and monastery at Ephrata, in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. While celibate, the community also welcomed believing families, who lived nearby and participated in joint worship. The monastic feature and celibacy were gradually abandoned after the American Revolution. In 1814 the Society was incorporated as the Seventh Day German Baptist Church. Several branches were established, some of which still exist. A group called the Church of God or &quot;New Dunkers&quot; withdrew in 1848. They disbanded in August 1962.

In 1782 the Brethren forbade slaveholding by its members.

The German Baptist Brethren grew from a small sect of about 1,500 German speaking members in 1790 to a mainly English speaking church with about 58,000 members in 500 congregations in 1880.

===The divisions of the early 1880s===

In the early 1880s there was a three-way division among the German Baptist Brethren: In 1881, the more conservative and traditional Old German Baptist Brethren withdrew from the larger progressive faction in order to maintain older customs, traditional dress, and simpler forms of worship. In 1883, the Brethren Church left the German Baptist Brethren over several matters revolving around separation 
from following fleeting fashions and whatever is popular 
with the world (James 4:4) including Sunday Schools, higher education, expensive and luxurious dress fads, revivalism, nationalism and practicing less church discipline.

The Old German Baptist Brethren and Old Brethren churches represent the conservative faction who wanted to remain plain and live a more simple, family and church-focused lifestyle. They wanted to focus on personal discipleship, daily and weekly worship, bearing one another&#x27;s burdens, and working together to build relationships while conquering obstacles. They did not want to lose their children to a fast, self-centered lifestyle and kept a cautious attitude, waiting to observe resulting consequences rather than automatically accepting every new innovation of the 19th century. The Brethren Church represents the more liberal faction, pushing ahead to new frontiers because of their belief that a newer way of doing things is a better way. The mainline progressive German Baptist Brethren changed their name to the Church of the Brethren in 1908.

The most conservative Brethren churches emphasize consistency, commitment to daily discipleship and literally following the New Testament, which is the &quot;order of the Brethren.&quot; They favor a capella singing, as the voice is the best instrument, made by God. They do not trust the fruit of spiritual innovations, such as Sunday Schools and emotional extended meetings. They promote plain dress, simple uncomplicated living, reading and following the words of Jesus. They believe that worldly amusements and entertainment appeal to and feed the flesh rather than the spirit, often taking the place of regular worship and fellowship, distracting believers and becoming forms of idolatry. They believe Jesus is calling all of us to be disciples, to love and follow Him. The progressives in the Brethren church focused on grace, novel practices, assimilation and acceptance. They promote higher education, salaried ministers, liturgical services and Sunday Schools, and revivalism. The majority of Brethren hold a position between the two extremes.

In 1869 and 1880, a group of Brethren in the Miami River Valley of Ohio submitted a petition to Annual Conference to stop the liberalization and return to traditional Biblical Brethren values. On both occasions, a more moderate petition was submitted to the delegates. Both times, the Miami River Valley group found the rewording unclear and ambiguous, and therefore unacceptable.

In 1881, they resubmitted their petition to Annual Conference, and it was rejected for violating a technical procedure. In November 1881, conservative Brethren led by the Miami River Valley group met and formally split from the Church of the Brethren to form the Old German Baptist Brethren. They held their first annual meeting in 1882.

At the same time, Henry Holsinger, a leader of the progressives in the church, published writings that some Brethren considered slanderous, anti-Jesus, and unscriptural and schismatic. As a result, he was dis-fellowshipped from the 1882 annual meeting of the Brethren. He met with other progressives on June 6 and 7, 1883, and together they formed The Brethren Church.

The remaining middle group retained the name German Baptist Brethren. At the Annual Conference of 1908 at Des Moines, Iowa, the name was officially changed to the Church of the Brethren. Their Annual Conference justified the name change by citing the predominant use of English in the church, the fact that the name &quot;German Baptist&quot; frustrated some mission work, and that it would helpfully disassociate the denomination from the Old German Baptist Brethren.

===Departure of small conservative groups===
In the early 20th century several more conservative Brethren left the Old German Baptist Brethren and formed their own churches.

In 1913, a group broke away in Indiana and formed the Old Brethren. In 1915, another congregation of Old Brethren was organized in California. The issue which is often given as the initial cause for division was the changes brought in with acceptance of automobiles and telephones among the Old German Baptist Brethren. Generally, the Old Brethren also wanted more unity and wanted to uphold the old order form of annual meeting which was simpler than had recently developed among the Old German Baptists. There was more division over the acceptance of the automobile in 1930. After the 1930 divide, those who adopted the use of the automobile placed less stress on annual meeting authority than did the parent body, believing it to be more for edification and teaching. Personal conviction from the Holy Spirit and Scripture rather than legislative decisions of annual meeting is now the basis for adherence to the church&#x27;s order. Old Brethren adult membership, among six congregations (in California, Arkansas, Indiana, and Ohio), in 2000 was 250.

In 1939, Old Brethren who wished to maintain the stress on annual meeting decisions and the rejection of automobiles, telephones, electricity, and tractors formed a group called the Old Brethren German Baptists. Old Brethren German Baptist membership in 2012 was over 100 and growing rapidly, with congregations in Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.

As the original &quot;Old German Baptist Brethren&quot; body became more accepting of automobiles, another group withdrew in 1921 to become the Old Order German Baptist Brethren. They do not use automobiles, electric power or telephones but do use tractors in the field and for transportation on the public roadways for work related activities, such as going to work sites or selling produce in towns. Two other minor divisions in the parent body of &quot;Old German Baptist Brethren&quot; occurred in the 1990s resulting in three car driving congregations of 185 total members. While each conference has an &quot;official&quot; name, members of all conferences refer to themselves generally as Old Order German Baptists.

===Further division===

In 2009, a major division was a result of the rejection, by a large percentage of members (approximately 2,400 individuals), of an unprecedented committee report adopted by the 2009 Annual Meeting held near Waterford, CA. The report stated in part, &quot;Members of the Old German Baptist Brethren Church in full fellowship and in good standing with the Church, believe and agree that the Old German Baptist Brethren’s interpretation of New Testament doctrine is scriptural and has been prompted by the Holy Spirit and it is their mind to remain in this fellowship and to teach, support and promote the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. It will be expected that members hearing the reading of this report will be willing to accept the same.&quot;

No positions on specific questions of doctrine or church practice before the Conference were addressed in the Report, though the general understanding was that it asked for an affirmation of loyalty to traditional doctrine and practice as interpreted by the more traditional/conservative arm of membership. Conference representatives were sent to each district (congregation) in the brotherhood to determine the willingness of each member to accept the report. Those who refused to accept the report gave their names, which were recorded and sent to the secretary of the standing committee for processing, and they were disfellowshipped (i.e. excommunicated). Members who refused to accept the Report were given 60 days to reconsider their decision without repercussion. Those who remained silent or did not attend the meetings were assumed to be in agreement or willing to submit to the decision, and were retained as members.

A majority of the members who did not accept the Report and were subsequently disfellowshipped participated in the re-organization of a new body, which was organized at a July 3, 2009, meeting in Troy, Ohio, called the Old German Baptist Brethren, New Conference. Several fundamental disagreements identified by the New Conference and adherents included: allowing regular group Bible studies outside of the Sunday worship setting; permitting open outreach and mission efforts; use of e-mail and the Internet; Scriptural application of church discipline as guided by Matthew 18; and preservation of the historical Brethren practice of decision-making by &quot;taking the voice&quot; (or vote) of every member, whereas no discussion was permitted upon presentation of the 2009 Report, and only a vote of affirmation was permitted.

The New Conference Polity Statement, declares that &quot;the church must never be elevated to a place of equality with Jesus Christ,&quot; reflecting the New Conference&#x27;s somewhat more individualistic approach to faith (in opposition to the parent body&#x27;s stronger emphasis on unity through mutual practice and theology). The majority of the remainder of the departing members have joined similar existing groups such as the Old Brethren or Dunkard Brethren, or moved on to more mainstream church fellowships. Since the split, a few families who stood with the New Conference in 2009 have returned to their Old Conference membership, primarily in Ohio and Indiana, and several families have migrated to the New Conference from the Old since that time, primarily in Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

===Recent events===
Following the division of 2009, the majority that remained with the Old German Baptist Brethren (often referred to as the &quot;Old Conference&quot;) decided at their 2010 Annual Conference to continue the ban on email and the internet. They agreed to allow very limited use for member businesses already online, with the understanding that they discontinue use within three years.

To date, the subsequent queries again requesting some form of business use have been met with a discussions ending in reaffirmation of the 2010 decision. As of 2015, there is a group of nine brethren working autonomously with outside communications companies to arrange a &quot;third party&quot; system to allow their members access to needed online information without actually using the World Wide Web themselves.

An increasing adherence to traditional patterns of dress and practice has also become significantly more evident among the remaining conservative membership. A trickle of members moving to the more traditional horse and buggy groups (primarily Old Brethren German Baptist) may also have slowed. Increasing conservatism in the Old German Baptist Brethren has also had a bearing on the decision of a majority of the former members of the Philip Hess faction of the German Baptist Brethren to join the Old Conference of the Old German Baptist Brethren after the dissolution of that group in September–October 2010.

The increasing conservatism since the 2009 division was not sufficient for the majority of the Gene Wagoner faction of the German Baptist Brethren to move to the Old German Baptist Brethren upon the dissolution of that group in spring of 2012, although several of them did reunite with the parent body Old German Baptist Brethren Church prior to the 2012 Annual Conference. Several of the former members of that faction have joined the small migration of former Old German Baptist Brethren moving to Trenton, MO and have united with them in the more traditional horse and buggy Old Brethren German Baptist group.

After the 2015 Annual Meeting voiced to formally permit the filtered/third-party Internet service facilitated by the &quot;Brethren Resource Group&quot;, several of the more-conservative congregations who were dissatisfied with the decision of the majority repeatedly sent queries to subsequent Annual Meetings objecting to the decision and the procedure used at the 2015 meeting. Not receiving satisfaction and being unwilling to submit to the repeated decisions and re-affirmations of the general brotherhood at the Annual Meeting, and following the work of a committee of elders called to the Antietam, PA congregation to resolve several issues, there were two independent meetings held on November 11-12 and December 9-10, 2020, on a farm near Greencastle, Pennsylvania, to discuss the grievances of the dissatisfied members and to consider a formal separation from the main body. 

An agreement was reached by those present to re-organize as The Old German Baptist Church, and between 500 and 600 members aligned themselves with this new group; the majority of the new membership was primarily composed of individuals from Pennsylvania, along with others from New York, Wisconsin, California, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and West Virginia. While technology was the most vocal point of contention over the last several years, there were several resolutions adopted at the December 2020 by the separating members. These included a commitment to unanimity in decision-making (which has since been modified), greater caution and avoidance of internet usage and related technology, greater adherence and discipline toward plainness of dress, and the prevalence of conference decisions over local practices.

==Theology==

In general, the theological position of the OGBB can be diverse, and often represented geographically. A &quot;Doctrinal Treatise&quot; was published in 1952, primarily for the sake of young men who went abroad in Civilian Public Service camps or other work programs, and it presents many doctrinal distinctives of the OGBB; however it is not a creed or formal statement of faith to which members must subscribe, as members interpret and apply some of its various theological points differently. When asked for a creed, most Old German Baptist Brethren claim that the New Testament is the closest thing they have to a creed.

Generally, the OGBB believe in Free Will, and that faith and baptism in the Lord Jesus Christ is required for salvation, to be followed by a life of literal obedience to His word (the result of that faith). When there is a question of applications for a specific issue or area of life for which Scripture has no clear mandate, the members gather once a year at their annual meeting and consider the issue in light of Scripture, past practices, and current contexts, then voice (or vote) on it, with a few chosen leaders of the church counting the votes. While the Brethren strive for unanimity in any decision, that is difficult to achieve, and often the vote is decided by a majority voice. If such cannot be reached, the issue is laid down (closed) or deferred until the following annual meeting. These decisions are kept on record as &quot;Minutes of the Annual Meeting&quot;, and referred back to for consideration when there is any significant deviation from them. They touch on many things, including dress, technology, political involvement, and entertainment. This Minute Book is kept in the homes of the members. 

The theological position of the OGBB was largely established by Peter Nead and William J. Shoup, both prolific Brethren authors and preachers. Nead, in particular, was a schooled Lutheran who converted to the Brethren and brought a refined system of teaching to the fellowship. Today the writings of Alexander Mack, R. H. Miller, Peter Nead, and the collected essays of Samuel Kinsey, along with the collected articles of the group&#x27;s monthly periodical, &quot;The Vindicator&quot;, form their most important doctrinal writings. A lively series of devotional and doctrinal essays continue to appear in the &quot;Vindicator&quot; each month. Ex-member Michael Hari contributed two widely circulated books of essays titled Brethren Thinking and One Faith in recent years.

==Religious practice==
The Old German Baptist Brethren historically believe in baptismal regeneration, placing the emphasis on the obedience of the new believer through faith, repentance, and baptism rather than a sacramental view that the water itself washes away sins. This is the official position of the church while individual members may differ somewhat in personal belief. They are noted for several ordinances like believer&#x27;s baptism by trine immersion, feet washing, the love feast, a communion of unleavened bread and wine, the holy kiss, and anointing of the sick with oil. Baptism is by trine- and forward- immersion in water. They hold an Annual Meeting associated with Pentecost, and cooperate in publishing a monthly periodical, &quot;The Vindicator&quot;.

The Old German Baptist Brethren are a non-resistant sect, whose young men usually file as conscientious objectors in times of war. Members of the church do not believe in defending themselves against physical attacks outside of war, either. Members do not file lawsuits, defend themselves against lawsuits, or use liens to collect debts.

===Worship===
The form of worship is fairly consistent from church to church, with a cappella singing, kneeling in prayer, sermons by congregationally elected ministers (called the &quot;plural ministry&quot; because of having several ministers in each congregation), and provision for divided seating with women and men assembled on opposite sides of the meetinghouse. The Old German Baptist Brethren use their own hymn book, of which most members maintain a personal copy. The hymns were written by both Old German Baptist Brethren members and many well-known authors from the 18th and 19th centuries. The style of singing is generally started and led by a congregationally-elected deacon, and is slow, usually in 4 part harmony or unison. The more conservative in practice a district may be, the slower the singing tends to be, though the difference may not be immediately obvious to visitors. The singing is similar to that of River Brethren or Old Order Mennonites.

===Plain dress===
The Old German Baptist Brethren dress plain. The women&#x27;s dress is similar to the dress patterns of River Brethren or plain Mennonites, like the &quot;Joe Wengers&quot; (Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church) or the Beachy Amish: long dresses and white cloth or net cap-style head coverings. The main difference is the use of a Brethren-style angled cape over the dress bodice, which is only attached around the neck and not at the waist as Mennonites and Amish do. The more conservative women may wear a loose winter cloak instead of a more form-fitting coat, and a black bonnet over their white covering when going out. The men wear beards without moustaches, button up shirts, plain coats without lapels at worship services and often the more conservative men wear suspenders and black hats. The beard, worn without the mustache, is required for those in ministry, and encouraged but not required for lay brothers.

===Restrictions on technology===

There are no radios, television sets, stereos, tape recorders, VCRs, or large musical instruments in members&#x27; homes. There has been a long debate over the use of the Internet since the mid-1990s; contrary to various reports, it was not the primary catalyst for the split in 2009 or 2020 (see above paragraph on 2009 division).

==Members and congregations==
According to the 2009 Directory of Officials, the Old German Baptist Brethren had 6,149 members in 56 churches at the end of 2008, although this number was reduced to approximately 3600 members after the 2009 Annual Meeting Report which led to the organization of the Old German Baptist Brethren (New Conference). The largest concentration of congregations is in Ohio (16), followed by Indiana (9), California (4), Kansas (5), Pennsylvania (5), Virginia (4), Washington (3), Florida (2), Wisconsin (2), Georgia (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), Montana (1), Oregon (1), Tennessee (1), and West Virginia (1). Almost 54% of the members live in Ohio and Indiana. The numbers above refer to the Old German Baptist Brethren before the split in 2009. In 2016 the Old German Baptist Brethren had about 4,000 members.

<text>Sir Frank Watson Dyson, KBE, FRS, FRSE (8 January 1868 – 25 May 1939) was an English astronomer and the ninth Astronomer Royal who is remembered today largely for introducing time signals (&quot;pips&quot;) from Greenwich, England, and for the role he played in proving Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity.

== Biography ==
Dyson was born in Measham, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the son of the Rev Watson Dyson, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Frances Dodwell. The family lived on St John Street in Wirksworth while Frank was one- to three-years-old. They moved to Yorkshire in his youth. There he attended Heath Grammar School, Halifax, and subsequently won scholarships to Bradford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and astronomy, being placed Second Wrangler in 1889.

In 1894 he joined the Royal Astronomical Society, the British Astronomical Association and was given the post of Senior Assistant at Greenwich Observatory and worked on the Astrographic Catalogue, which was published in 1905. He was appointed Astronomer Royal for Scotland from 1905 to 1910, and Astronomer Royal (and Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory) from 1910 to 1933. In 1928, he introduced in the Observatory a new free-pendulum clock, the most accurate clock available at that time and organised the regular wireless transmission from the GPO wireless station at Rugby of Greenwich Mean Time. He also, in 1924, introduced the distribution of the &quot;six pips&quot; via the BBC. He was for several years President of the British Horological Institute and was awarded their gold medal in 1928.

Dyson was noted for his study of solar eclipses and was an authority on the spectrum of the corona and on the chromosphere. He is credited with organising expeditions to observe the 1919 solar eclipse at Brazil and Príncipe, which he somewhat optimistically began preparing for prior to the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Dyson presented his observations of the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 to a joint meeting of the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society on 6 November 1919. The observations confirmed Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of the effect of gravity on light which until that time had been received with some scepticism by the scientific community.

Dyson died on board a ship while travelling from Australia to England in 1939, and was buried at sea.

* The crater Dyson on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 1241 Dysona.

==Family==

In 1894 he married Caroline Bisset Best (d.1937), the daughter of Palemon Best, with whom he had two sons and six daughters: Stella, Evelyn, Sylvia, Margaret, Palemon, Watson, Elsie and Ruth.

==Frank Dyson and Freeman Dyson==
Although Frank Dyson and theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson were not known to be related, their fathers Rev Watson Dyson and George Dyson both hailed from West Yorkshire where the surname originates and is most densely clustered. Freeman Dyson credited Sir Frank with sparking his interest in astronomy: because they shared the same last name, Sir Frank&#x27;s achievements were discussed by Freeman Dyson&#x27;s family when he was a young boy. Inspired, Dyson&#x27;s first attempt at writing was a 1931 piece of juvenilia entitled &quot;Sir Phillip Robert&#x27;s Erolunar Collision&quot; – Sir Philip being a thinly disguised version of Sir Frank.

== In popular media ==
Actor Alec McCowen was cast as Sir Frank Dyson in the TV series &quot;Longitude&quot;, broadcast in 2000.

<text>Raymond is a male given name. It was borrowed into English from French (older French spellings were Reimund and Raimund, whereas the modern English and French spellings are identical). It originated as the Germanic ᚱᚨᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (&quot;Raginmund&quot;) or ᚱᛖᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (&quot;Reginmund&quot;). &quot;Ragin&quot; (Gothic) and &quot;regin&quot; (Old German) meant &quot;counsel&quot;. The Old High German &quot;mund&quot; originally meant &quot;hand&quot;, but came to mean &quot;protection&quot;. This etymology suggests that the name originated in the Early Middle Ages, possibly from Latin. Alternatively, the name can also be derived from Germanic Hraidmund, the first element being &quot;Hraid&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;fame&quot; (compare &quot;Hrod&quot;, found in names such as Robert, Roderick, Rudolph, Roland, Rodney and Roger) and &quot;mund&quot; meaning &quot;protector&quot;. 

Despite the German and French origins of the English name, some of its early uses in English documents appear in Latinized form. As a surname, its first recorded appearance in Britain appeared in 1086, during the reign of William the Conqueror, in the Domesday Book, with a reference to Giraldus Reimundus.

The most commonly used names for baby boys based on &quot;Ragin&quot; in 2009 were, in descending order, Raymond, Ramiro, Rayner, Rein, Reingard, Reynard, and Reynold. Its many other variants include Raiment, Raimo, Raimond, Raimondi, Raimondo, Raimund, Raimundo, Ramon, Ramón, Ramond, Ramondelli, Ramondenc, Ramondi, Ramondini, Ramondino, Ramondo, Ramondou, Ramonenc, Ramonic, Ramundi, Rayment, Raymonenc, Raymonencq, Raymont, Raymund, Redmond, Redmonds, Reim, Reimund, Reinmund, Rémon, Rémond, Reimondo, Remondeau, Remondon, Rémont, Reymond, Rimondi, and Rimondini.

<text>Rupert Bear is an English children&#x27;s comic strip character and franchise created by Herbert Tourtel and illustrated by his wife, the artist Mary Tourtel, first appearing in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper on 8 November 1920. Rupert&#x27;s initial purpose was to win sales from the rival &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. In 1935, the stories were taken over by Alfred Bestall, who was previously an illustrator for &quot;Punch&quot; and other glossy magazines. Bestall proved to be successful in the field of children&#x27;s literature and worked on Rupert stories and artwork into his nineties. More recently, various other artists and writers have continued the series. About 50 million copies have been sold worldwide.

The comic strip is published daily in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, with many of these stories later being printed in books, and every year since 1936 a Rupert annual has also been released. Rupert Bear is a part of children&#x27;s culture in the United Kingdom, and appears in 4 TV shows based on the character.

==Characters and story==
Rupert is a bear who lives with his parents in a house in Nutwood, a fictional idyllic English village. He is drawn wearing a red jumper and bright yellow checked trousers, with matching yellow scarf. Originally depicted as a brown bear, his colour soon changed to white to save on printing costs, though he remained brown on the covers of the annuals.

Most of the other characters in the series are also anthropomorphic animals. They are all scaled to be about the same size as Rupert, regardless of species. Rupert&#x27;s animal friends are usually referred to as his &quot;chums&quot; or &quot;pals.&quot; Aside from his best friend Bill Badger, some of the most enduring pals are an elephant (Edward Trunk), a mouse (Willie), Pong-Ping the Pekingese, Algy Pug (who actually pre-dates Rupert), Podgy Pig, Bingo the Brainy Pup, the identical twins Freddy and Ferdy Fox, the identical twins Reggie and Rex Rabbit, and Ming the dragon. The kindly Wise Old Goat also lives in Nutwood, and helps Rupert in some of his adventures. One of the most unusual and evocative characters is Raggety, a woodland troll-creature made from twigs, who is often very grumpy and annoying. In the 2006 television revival of the series, Raggety has been transformed into a friendly elf with broken English. There is also a recurring country Police Officer who is an adult dog named PC Growler.
There are also a few human characters in the stories, such as the Professor (who lives in a castle with his servant, Bodkin), Tiger Lily (a Chinese girl), her father &quot;the Conjuror,&quot; and several less frequently occurring characters such as Sailor Sam, Gaffer Jarge, Captain Binnacle, the Sage of Um (who is seen travelling in a magical upside down umbrella) and Rollo, the Gypsy boy. There is also a recurring Merboy.
During his time as Rupert writer, Alfred Bestall added further characters such as the girl guides Beryl, Pauline and Janet, with Beryl&#x27;s cat, Dinky. These characters were based on Girl Guides from Bestall&#x27;s own church who asked him in late 1947 if they could have their own adventure with Rupert. They remain part of the comic series even today.

The series often features fantastic and magical adventures in faraway lands. Each story begins in Nutwood, where Rupert usually sets out on a small errand for his mother or to visit a friend, which then develops into an adventure to an exotic place such as King Frost&#x27;s Castle, the Kingdom of the Birds, underground, or to the bottom of the sea. Sometimes one of the Professor&#x27;s inventions opens the door to one of Rupert&#x27;s adventures. At the end of the story Rupert returns to Nutwood, where all is safe and well, and where his parents seem perfectly sanguine about his adventures.

==Style==

Unlike most modern comic strips, Rupert Bear has always been produced in the original form of strip with illustrations accompanying text, called &quot;text comics&quot;, as opposed to text being incorporated directly into the art; for example, within speech balloons.

Bestall developed the classic Rupert story format: the story is told in picture form (generally two panels each day in the newspaper and four panels to a page in the annuals), in simple page-headers, in rhyming two-line-per-image verse, and as running prose at the foot. Rupert Annuals can therefore be &quot;read&quot; on four levels.

==History==

Rupert&#x27;s unspectacular introduction was in a single panel, the first of 36 episodes of the story &quot;Little Lost Bear&quot; written by Herbert and drawn by Mary Tourtel.

Bestall expanded the stories and plots of Rupert; and in addition to precise and detailed drawings for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; panels he also created beautifully crafted illustrations in the Rupert Annuals. Bestall drew the Rupert stories for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; until 1965; and continued to illustrate the covers for the annuals until his retirement in 1973. Much of the landscape in Rupert is inspired by the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales (Alfred Bestall himself lived for many years in the north Welsh village of Beddgelert)(the Professor&#x27;s castle is based on Ruthin Castle), the Sussex Weald and East Devon. Bestall&#x27;s successor was Alex Cubie. Cubie created Rupert annual artwork between 1974 and 1977. His images are recognisable from the thicker black outlines around the characters and the use of more vibrant colours than Bestall employed. A Rupert Annual is still produced every year and Rupert appears each day in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. In 1978, his new adventures became illustrated by John Harrold; his drawings in the annual were usually coloured by Gina Hart. In 2008 John Harrold was succeeded by Stuart Trotter and a new style of annual (sans serif typeface) with a more modern Rupert to tie-in with the CGI-animation &quot;Rupert Bear, Follow the Magic...&quot;, began.

The Rupert Annual for 1960 contained a story called &quot;Rupert and the Diamond Leaf&quot;, in which he visits &quot;Coon Island&quot;, whose inhabitants are little &quot;Coons&quot;. The Coons previously appeared on the cover of &quot;The New Rupert: The Daily Express Annual, 1954&quot; and in the interior story &quot;Rupert and the Castaway&quot;. The first appearance was in the 1946 soft cover summer special &quot;Rupert on Coon Island&quot;.

Rupert appeared in Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1984 music video &quot;We All Stand Together&quot;; McCartney also made an animated video starring Rupert called &quot;Rupert and the Frog Song&quot;. The short film, produced by McCartney won the British Academy Award.
Tourtel&#x27;s home was in Canterbury in Kent, and the Rupert Bear Museum, formerly part of the Canterbury Heritage Museum, which has since closed, had collections that covered much of the history of Rupert and his friends, as well as Tourtel and other illustrators. The museum was geared toward families and those interested in the general history of Rupert.

On 31 October 2005, UK Media Group Entertainment Rights (which was later bought by Boomerang Media, then DreamWorks Classics and now NBCUniversal) purchased a majority interest in the Rupert Bear character from the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

==Television series==

===&quot;The Adventures of Rupert Bear&quot; (1970–1977)===
Rupert first appeared on television in an ITC series produced for the ITV network that ran for 156 ten-minute episodes. The characters were all puppets, although the opening sequence featured a toy Rupert bear sitting in a live-action child&#x27;s bedroom. Rupert&#x27;s friends and flying chariot appeared straight from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; pages, although he was joined by some new friends including Willy Wisp, Drizzle, Della, Jimmy, Mr Grimnasty, Gypsy Granny, Chun-Mao, The Wise Old Wizard, and Mr Koskora
The theme song, written by Len Beadle (also known as Frank Weston) and Ron Roker, sung by Jackie Lee, reached number 14 in the UK charts in 1971.

===&quot;Rupert&quot; (1985–1988)===
&quot;Rupert&quot; returned to television in 1985 to the BBC, in the form of 36 five-minute-stories. In this series, each episode consisted of a series of still illustrations and narration. The sole narrator was Ray Brooks. The short title music is credited to Brave New World. In the US, these shorts aired on the Disney Channel as part of its &quot;Lunch Box&quot; program.

===&quot;Rupert&quot; (1991–1997)===
In 1991, Rupert Bear featured in an animated television series with 65 episodes and five seasons (13 per season) produced by Nelvana (Canada), Ellipse (France) and Television South (TVS) for the first season (13 episodes), with Scottish TV taking over control from season 2 when Television South lost its ITV franchise. The show followed the style and tone Bestall established in the Rupert newspaper series, with many of the stories being almost direct adaptations of his or others&#x27; panel stories from the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

It was aired in syndication on YTV in Canada. In the U.S., the show first aired on Nickelodeon (as part of Nick Jr. block) before moving to CBS in January 1999; repeats of the series came to Qubo&#x27;s digital service in January 2007. The show was aired in the United Kingdom on CITV. In Australia, the show was aired on the ABC and on TV2 in New Zealand as part of the &quot;Jason Gunn show&quot;. The show has been returned in the United Kingdom on the satellite and cable network Tiny Pop. As of 2009, the show also airs daily on Qubo channel, although only the latter 26 episodes are being shown. In South America, the show was aired in Brazil by the TV Cultura channel between 1998 and 2008.

In 2000, the Canadian producer Nelvana made plans to produce a feature film about Rupert at Hollywood studios, but the project was not implemented.

===&quot;Rupert Bear, Follow The Magic...&quot; (2006–2008)===

In 2006, a new Rupert Bear stop-motion-animated television series was produced, skewing almost entirely towards small children. Changes to the characters are that Rupert wears trainers and his fur has a slight tan; Bill wears a dark blue leather jacket and blue pants with yellow stripes instead of his suit and bowtie, and tends to carry a personal digital assistant with him at all times; Pong Ping has become a girl who uses magic and had her name reversed; Raggety, who rarely appeared before, has become a friendly tree elf; Ming a baby dragon and Ping Pong&#x27;s pet; Edward no longer has tusks, his trunk has been straightened and he wears an orange T-shirt and brown shorts; and one of the fox twins (Ferdie) has been changed into a girl named Freda. There are new characters like Miranda the mermaid; but characters Podgy Pig, his self-obsessed sister Rosalie and the timid Willie Mouse make no appearances.

&quot;Rupert Bear, Follow The Magic ...&quot; was first aired on Five from 8 November 2006 until 1 February 2008. 52 ten-minute episodes were broadcast and subsequently repeated.

==Film==
A short film directed by Geoff Dunbar based on ideas/music/songs by Paul McCartney was made in 1984, titled &quot;Rupert and the Frog Song&quot;. It follows Rupert as he explores the country one night and finds a special gathering of frogs. The film contains a song titled &quot;We All Stand Together&quot;, written by McCartney and arranged by the Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin. The song reached No.3 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Video games==
The British video-game publisher Quicksilva adapted Rupert Bear for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum 8-bit computers, in two game instalments: the 1985 &quot;Rupert and the Toymaker&#x27;s Party&quot; and the 1986 &quot;Rupert and The Ice Castle&quot;.

==Stamps==
In September 2020, Royal Mail issued a set of eight stamps to commemorate the centenary of Rupert Bear. Featuring Bestall&#x27;s artwork, they comprised two second-class stamps, two first-class, two at £1.45 and two at £1.70.

==&quot;Oz&quot; magazine obscenity trial==

A cartoon of Rupert superimposed on a Robert Crumb drawing, showing the bear in a sexual situation, was a notable part of the notorious edition of the British underground magazine &quot;Oz&quot; guest-edited by schoolkids. Subsequently, the adult editors and publishers of the magazine were prosecuted in a high-profile obscenity trial at the Old Bailey in June 1971; the inclusion of Rupert formed a part of the prosecution&#x27;s case and defence witnesses were cross-examined on it.

<text>Annie &quot;Nancy&quot; Mary Pryde Nicholson (1899–1977) was an English painter and fabric designer.

==Early life==
Born Annie Mary Pryde Nicholson, she was the only daughter of the artists Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde. She had three brothers, artist Ben, architect Christopher and Anthony, who was killed in action in 1918 in the First World War.

==Robert Graves==
Nancy married the poet Robert Graves in 1918. The following year, Graves started as a student in Oxford University. The couple lived in a cottage on Boars Hill in Oxford, which they rented from the author John Masefield. In 1920, in partnership with a neighbour, The Hon. Mrs Michael Howard, Nancy set up a small grocer&#x27;s shop, next door to the Masefields&#x27; house. Alarmed by the tourists it attracted, Mrs Masefield opposed its takeover by an Oxford firm, and the project collapsed after six months, leaving heavy debts settled only with the help of friends and family. In disgust, Graves and Nancy moved to the village of Islip, the other side of Oxford.

A lifelong feminist, Nancy used to cycle to Oxfordshire villages and set up a stall to explain to women how to use contraception, when it was still illegal. Her open-mindedness led her to accept a triangular relationship, and from early 1926 Laura Riding lived with her and Graves in London The marriage eventually broke down, as Graves increasingly favoured Riding, leaving Nancy to bring up the four children of the marriage alone, in a succession of locations, including Cumberland and a further spell on Boars Hill. Nancy and Graves legally divorced in 1949.

==Publishing and textile design==
After a period in the early 1930s living with Geoffrey Taylor on a houseboat moored in Hammersmith, Nancy set up the Poulk Press, in which she collaborated for a time with him. They lived near Sutton Veny, Wiltshire, in a timber house designed by Nancy and built with family labour. Her relationship with Taylor lasted five years. She worked at this period with her brother Ben and his wife Barbara Hepworth on textiles. 

Undeterred by the failure of the Boars Hill shop, in the 1940s she ran a business in Motcomb Street, London. Her designs influenced her sister-in-law EQ Nicholson. Her work was exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1976.

<text>Naughty by Nature is an American hip hop trio from East Orange, New Jersey, consisting of Treach (Anthony Criss), Vin Rock (Vincent Brown), and DJ Kay Gee (born Keir Lamont Gist).

==History==
===1980s===
Treach formed Naughty by Nature with Vin Rock and DJ Kay Gee in 1986 as The New Style in East Orange, New Jersey, where they attended the same high school. The group first appeared on the music scene in 1989, releasing an album called &quot;Independent Leaders&quot;, and the album generated the minor hit &quot;Scuffin&#x27; Those Knees&quot;. After the release of their first album, the group was mentored by fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah, and subsequently changed their name. Queen Latifah introduced them to her label Tommy Boy Records and her management company.

===1990s===
Naughty by Nature&#x27;s first hit was &quot;O.P.P.&quot;, which sampled the Jackson 5&#x27;s hit &quot;ABC&quot; and was released in 1991 on their self-titled album &quot;Naughty by Nature&quot;. The track peaked at #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was named one of the top 100 rap singles of all time in 1998 by &quot;The Source&quot; magazine, and being ranked the 20th best single of the 1990s by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. The album generated another hit with a reworking of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; called &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be All Right&quot; (the track was also called &quot;Ghetto Bastard&quot; on some explicit releases). That song detailed the experiences of Treach growing up in poverty, and now rising up to live a better life. Powered by the success of that song and &quot;O.P.P.&quot;, their self-titled album went platinum.

Fellow New Jersey native Tony D accused Naughty by Nature of stealing a sample from his album &quot;Music Makes You Move&quot; and using it on &quot;O.P.P.&quot; The matter was settled out of court. Naughty by Nature scored a hit with the track &quot;Uptown Anthem&quot; from the soundtrack to the 1992 film &quot;Juice&quot;, in which Treach had a cameo appearance. Treach began to pursue an acting career after befriending Tupac Shakur on the set of &quot;Juice&quot;, and Naughty by Nature appeared in the 1993 film &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; as a street gang. After Shakur&#x27;s murder in 1996, Treach recorded a tribute song titled &quot;Mourn You Til I Join You&quot;.

Later, the group had multiple hits from its third and fourth albums, called &quot;19 Naughty III&quot; and &quot;Poverty&#x27;s Paradise&quot; respectively. Both albums reached the #1 spot on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Charts. &quot;Hip Hop Hooray&quot; was a success from the album &quot;19 Naughty III&quot;. Its video was directed by Spike Lee and featured cameos by Queen Latifah, Eazy-E, Run-D.M.C., and Da Youngstas. &quot;Poverty&#x27;s Paradise&quot; won the Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Rap Album, becoming the first album to win this award. It also spawned a hit song in &quot;Feel Me Flow&quot; which peaked at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

They produced a remix of the Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song &quot;Scream&quot; in 1995.

In the mid-1990s, Naughty by Nature started their own music imprint, Illtown Records, and in 1995 released an album from their protégés the Rottin Razkals.

In 1999, the group released its fifth album, titled &quot;Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature&#x27;s Fury&quot;. The album was fairly successful, being certified Gold by the RIAA, and spawned the hit &quot;Jamboree&quot; that peaked at #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===2000–2012===
After the release of &quot;Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature&#x27;s Fury&quot;, a dispute regarding finances developed between Kay Gee and Treach. Treach blamed Kay Gee for squandering the group&#x27;s finances. Due to these disagreements DJ Kay Gee decided to leave Naughty by Nature in late 2000. He started to develop his own record label Divine Mill. In 2001, the group released a song &#x27;Here Comes The Money&#x27; that has constantly been used as the entrance theme for Shane McMahon in WWE. The remainder of the group, Treach and Vin Rock, released an album in 2002 called &quot;IIcons&quot;. Due to Kay Gee&#x27;s absence, the group used a variety of different producers including Da Beatminerz. The album, however, received a lukewarm reception from the public. In 2002, the group disbanded.
In May 2006, Kay Gee reunited with Treach and rejoined Naughty by Nature at a concert at B.B. King&#x27;s nightclub. In April 2010 they released the single &quot;Get to Know Me Better&quot;, featuring rapper Pitbull, while the B-side of the single was called &quot;I Gotta Lotta&quot;. Later in 2010 they released the group&#x27;s first mixtape, &quot;Naughty by Nature: Tha Mixtape&quot;. In 2011 the three worked on their long-delayed seventh group album, and it finally saw release. Titled &quot;Anthem Inc.&quot;, it came out December 13, 2011. It featured brand new material as well as re-recordings of the group&#x27;s past hits.

On June 11, 2011, Naughty by Nature became the first hip-hop group to perform at Fenway Park. They performed &quot;Hip Hop Hooray&quot; as part of the mega boyband NKOTBSB&#x27;s concert.

In March 2012, following the release of a documentary on fellow New Jersey–based hip hop group Sugar Hill Gang, Naughty by Nature performed in Asbury Park, NJ at the Garden State film festival.

===Since 2013: Breakup and reconciliation===
In May 2013, frontman Treach shocked fans when he revealed that Vin Rock had been &quot;fired&quot; from the group after failing to put in the same amount of energy as himself and DJ Kay Gee. At the time, Treach said he and Vinnie had not been on speaking terms for around two years.

In April 2015, Treach said he and Vinnie had resolved their issues, but now their relationship was strictly &quot;business&quot;. &quot;You got teammates, sometimes, that&#x27;s on the same team, they may not feel each other. At the end of the day, you going out to win. That&#x27;s what we doing&quot;, Treach said. Although the two were cordial, he said another Naughty by Nature album was unlikely.

In January 2016, in celebration of their 25th anniversary, Naughty by Nature posted the video for their song &quot;God Is Us&quot; from &quot;Anthem Inc.&quot; to their YouTube channel.

On May 2, 2019, the Mixtape Tour commenced in Cincinnati, Ohio. Performers included Naughty by Nature, Salt-N-Pepa, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany, with New Kids on the Block being billed as the headline performers.

<text>The American Game is an American breed of game fowl, chickens bred specifically for cockfighting. It has many color varieties, and may also be kept for ornament.

== History ==

The American Game was bred for cockfighting. The full-size (&quot;large fowl&quot;) American Game is not recognized by the American Poultry Association, which in 2009 recognized the American Game Bantam in ten colors. The American Game is not among the fifty-three chicken breeds reported by the National Animal Germplasm Program of the USDA Agricultural Research Service to the DAD-IS database of the FAO, nor is it recognized by the Entente Européenne d&#x27;Aviculture et de Cuniculture or by the Poultry Club of Great Britain. In 2020 its conservation status was listed by the Livestock Conservancy as &quot;study&quot;; in 2021 it was no longer listed.

Some stock has been exported to the United Kingdom; in 2002 there were fewer than a hundred birds there.

=== American Game Bantam ===

The bantam version of the breed does not derive from the original large fowl. It was created in New Jersey in the 1940s by a breeder named Frank Gary. He cross-bred the wild Red Jungle Fowl with fighting bantams of the type known at the time as &quot;pit game&quot;. The American Game Bantam was listed in the yearbook of the American Bantam Association from 1950, and was admitted to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 2009.

== Characteristics ==

The standard-sized American Game is bred in a wide range of plumage colors; cock birds have long sickle feathers.

The bantam has a small five-pointed single comb and small smooth wattles and earlobes. Ten color varieties are recognized by the APA: birchen; black; black-breasted red; blue; blue red; brown red; golden duckwing; red pyle; silver duckwing; and white. Two others, &quot;brassy back&quot; and wheaten, are also raised.

== Use ==

The American Game was bred for cockfighting. It is a good table bird, and may be kept for ornament. Hens lay brown eggs of medium to large size. As with other fighting breeds, for exhibition the comb, earlobes and wattles are cut off (&quot;dubbed&quot;).

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-8, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 8: Latin/Hebrew alphabet&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings. ISO/IEC 8859-8:1999 from 1999 represents its second and current revision, preceded by the first edition ISO/IEC 8859-8:1988 in 1988. It is informally referred to as Latin/Hebrew. &quot;ISO/IEC 8859-8&quot; covers all the Hebrew letters, but no Hebrew vowel signs. IBM assigned [[code page]] 916 (CCSIDs 916 and 5012) to it. This character set was also adopted by Israeli Standard SI1311:2002, with some extensions.

ISO-8859-8 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The text is (usually) in logical order, so bidi processing is required for display. Nominally &quot;ISO-8859-8&quot; (code page 28598) is for “visual order”, and ISO-8859-8- (code page 38598) is for logical order. But usually in practice, and required for XML documents, &quot;ISO-8859-8&quot; also stands for logical order text. The WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5 treats ISO-8859-8 and ISO-8859-8- as distinct encodings with the same mapping due to influence on the layout direction, but notes that this no longer applies to ISO-8859-6 (Arabic), only to ISO-8859-8.

There is also ISO-8859-8-E which supposedly requires directionality to be explicitly specified with special control characters; this latter variant is in practice unused.

The Microsoft Windows code page for Hebrew, Windows-1255, is mostly an extension of ISO/IEC 8859-8 without C1 controls, except for the omission of the double underscore, and replacement of the generic currency sign (¤) with the sheqel sign (₪). It adds support for vowel points as combining characters, and some additional punctuation.

Over a decade after the publication of that standard, Unicode is preferred, at least for the Internet (meaning UTF-8, the dominant encoding for web pages). ISO-8859-8 is used by less than 0.1% of websites.

==Code page layout==

FD is left-to-right mark (U+200E) and FE is right-to-left mark (U+200F), as specified in a newer amendment as ISO/IEC 8859-8:1999.

=== 2002 Israeli Standard extensions ===
Israeli Standard SI1311:2002 matches ISO/IEC 8859-8:1999 except for a number of additional character allocations for the euro sign, new shekel sign and more advanced explicit bidirectional formatting.

<doc id="333878" wikidata="Q2066520" url="?curid=333878" title="William Nicholson (artist)">
<text>Sir William Newzam Prior Nicholson (5 February 1872 – 16 May 1949) was a British painter of still-life, landscape and portraits. He also worked as a printmaker in techniques including woodcut, wood-engraving and lithography, as an illustrator, as an author of children&#x27;s books and as a designer for the theatre.

==Life==
William Nicholson was born in Newark-on-Trent on 5 February 1872, the youngest son of William Newzam Nicholson, an industrialist and Conservative MP of Newark, and his wife Annie Elizabeth Prior, the daughter of Joseph Prior and Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Mallam) of Woodstock, Oxon. From the age of 9 he attended Magnus Grammar School, first as a weekly boarder, later as a day-boy. He had art lessons from the painter, politician and art-master William Cubley of Newark-on-Trent, who had been a pupil of Sir William Beechey, in turn a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He was briefly a student at Hubert von Herkomer&#x27;s art school, where he met his future wife Mabel Pryde (1871–1918), who introduced him to her brother James Pryde (1866–1941). From the autumn of 1891 he attended the Académie Julian in Paris, but after six months returned to Newark.

In the spring of 1893, Nicholson eloped with Mabel Pryde, whom he had by then known for four years; they were married in Ruislip on 25 April. The couple went to live in what had been a pub, the Eight Bells at Denham, Bucks. They were soon joined by Mabel&#x27;s brother James, and not long after by Ellen Terry&#x27;s son Edward Gordon Craig and his wife May, who had also recently eloped and married. Nicholson received an annual allowance of £150 from his father.

William and Mabel Nicholson had four children: the celebrated painter Ben (1894–1982); (John) Anthony (1897–1918), who died of wounds in France during the First World War; Annie Mary &quot;Nancy&quot; (1899–1978), artist and wife of the poet Robert Graves; and the architect and designer Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; (1904–1948). Mabel died in July 1918 in the Spanish flu epidemic, and Anthony died near the end of the war on 5 October 1918 of wounds received in action. The inscription on Nicholson&#x27;s son&#x27;s grave reads simply: &quot;TONY&quot;. War commemoration artwork produced by Nicholson included &quot;The Cenotaph (Morning of the Peace Procession)&quot; (1919).

From about 1910 until he remarried in 1919, Nicholson&#x27;s housekeeper Marie Laquelle, whose real name was Adèle Marie Schwarz, &quot;née&quot; Schiestel, was also his mistress. Nicholson painted her several times, first as &quot;Carlina&quot; in 1909; he also painted her daughter Georgette and her second husband Norman Holder.

In October 1919, Nicholson married Edith Minnie, daughter of Sir Lionel Phillips, first baronet, and widow of Lieutenant-Colonel John Stuart-Wortley (killed in action, 21 March 1918), who, under the name Elizabeth Drury, was also a painter. Nicholson had painted her in the previous year as &quot;Lady in Grey&quot;. They had two sons, William and Gavin, and a daughter Liza born in 1920. Edie had two children from her previous marriage, and Nancy&#x27;s daughter Jennie had been born the previous year. Nicholson&#x27;s books for children all date from the 1920s; around this time he lived at the Old Manor House, Sutton Veny, Wiltshire.

From 1935 until his death, Nicholson&#x27;s companion was the novelist Marguerite Steen. According to Steen, they met in Andalucia in May 1935, and by mid-June were living together at Nicholson&#x27;s mews studio in Apple Tree Yard, off Jermyn Street. Nicholson had been separated from Edie for some years, but they remained on good terms; although she promised to give him a divorce, she never did so.

In later life, Nicholson lived at Blewbury in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) where he died on 16 May 1949.

==Work==

===Graphic work===

From 1893 to 1898, Nicholson collaborated with his brother-in-law James Pryde on poster design and other graphic work including signboard painting and book illustration. They called themselves the Beggarstaffs, or J. &amp; W. Beggarstaff; in recent times they have been referred to as the Beggarstaff Brothers, although they did not use this name.

===Book design and illustration===

Nicholson provided illustrations and a cover design for &quot;An Alphabet by William Nicholson&quot;, &quot;An Almanac of Twelve Sports by William Nicholson with words by Rudyard Kipling&quot;, and &quot;London Types&quot;, all three published by William Heinemann in 1898. Two years later came &quot;The Square book of Animals by Sir William Nicholson with Rhymes by Arthur Waugh&quot; (W. Heinemann, 1900). He also illustrated several of the early books of his son-in-law Robert Graves and &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;, a book for children by Margery Williams (1922), and a new edition by Heinemann of John Gay’s &quot;Polly&quot; (1923). He also wrote and illustrated two books of his own for children, &quot;Clever Bill&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Pirate Twins&quot; (1929), both published by Faber &amp; Faber. In 1929 he provided illustrations for a new edition of Siegfried Sassoon’s &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;.

===Paintings===
From about 1900, Nicholson concentrated on painting, encouraged by Whistler. He first exhibited as a painter at the International Society, of which Whistler was President.

===Work in other fields===
In 1904, he designed the original settings for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and went on to design other plays and to illustrate several books. He also designed stained glass, notably a memorial window at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Mells.

=== Teaching ===

Nicholson had a number of pupils, including, in the 1930s, Winston Churchill. Churchill wrote that &quot;I think the person who taught me most about painting was William Nicholson&quot;.

==Reception==


Nicholson was awarded a gold medal in the graphic works section of the Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam for his &quot;Almanach de douze sports 1898&quot;, the French edition of the &quot;Almanac of Twelve Sports&quot;, published 30 years earlier. He was knighted in 1936.

<doc id="333883" wikidata="Q3107826" url="?curid=333883" title="Hersheypark">
<text>Hersheypark (known as Hershey Park until 1970) is a family theme park in Hershey, Pennsylvania, about east of Harrisburg, and west of Philadelphia. The park was founded in 1906, by Milton S. Hershey as a leisure park for the employees of the Hershey Chocolate Company. It is wholly and privately owned by Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Hersheypark has won several awards, including the Applause Award.

The park opened its first roller coaster in 1923, the Wild Cat, an early Philadelphia Toboggan Company coaster. In 1970, it began a redevelopment plan, which led to new rides, an expansion, and its renaming. The 1970s brought the SooperDooperLooper, an early complete-circuit looping roller coaster, as well as a observation tower, the Kissing Tower. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the park rapidly expanded. Between 1991 and 2008, it added eight roller coasters and the &quot;Boardwalk at Hersheypark&quot; water park. , the park covers over , containing 76 rides and attractions, as well as a zoo called &quot;ZooAmerica&quot;. Adjacent to the park is Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate World, a visitors&#x27; center attraction that contains shops, restaurants, and a chocolate factory-themed tour ride, where visitors can get their picture taken and receive a piece of chocolate at the end of the ride.

Prior to the reduction in worldwide theme park attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the park saw an average attendance of over 3.3 million visitors each year. In 2020, the park hosted 1.7 million visitors. It is the most visited theme park in Pennsylvania and the ninth most visited theme park in North America, as well as the largest theme park in North America outside of Ohio, Florida or California.

== History ==
In 1903, Milton S. Hershey, founder of the Hershey Chocolate Company, surveyed the town that would become Hershey. Included in his plans was a site along Spring Creek that would be suitable for a leisure park for Hershey employees. In 1905, a bridge was built over Spring Creek, and a pavilion was built on the hill that overlooked it. While the bridge was able to be constructed, the land on the banks of Spring Creek, from Derry Church to Union Deposit, and areas further north of the creek (including the area currently occupied by Hersheypark Arena and Stadium) was then owned by J.H. Nissley. In February 1906, Hershey purchased all but two tracts of land, near Union Deposit, from Nissley. In early spring, the Hershey baseball club staked out an area for a baseball field; a baseball diamond, a track surrounding the field, and grandstands were built. The first game was played on May 5, which was a 4–0 loss to Felton Athletic Club. This is also noted as the first open-air event in Hershey.

=== Name ===
On Wednesday, May 30, 1906, Hershey&#x27;s park was opened to the public and formally called Hershey Park. The festivities included a baseball game, in which Hershey defeated the Crescent Club of Harrisburg by a score of 13–1. Music was performed by the recently formed Hershey Band and other events were held on park grounds. Prior to that time, the park had been called various unofficial names, including &quot;West-end&quot; Park and Hershey&#x27;s Park, which (despite being a popular, and grammatically correct, choice) was picked over in order to combine the words Hershey and Park. In 1970, after more than 60 years of operation, park management decided to redevelop the park into a theme park. The name was changed to Hersheypark in 1971, and it has operated under that name ever since.

=== Amusement rides and attractions ===

The first ride was added to the park in 1908 – an Allen Herschel carousel often referred to as the &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;. This was followed in 1910 with the addition of the Miniature Railroad, which remained in operation until the end of the 1971 season. The park has operated a bumper car ride since 1926, a variety of boat rides on Spring Creek, and six dark rides, three of which were fun houses. The park added its first two kiddie rides in 1926, The Prowler and The Regurgitator, and has added well over 40 since then.

==== Roller coasters ====
The park added its first roller coaster in 1923, the Wild Cat, for the town of Hershey&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, which operated until 1945. It was replaced by the park&#x27;s second wooden roller coaster, Comet, in 1946. Between then and 1996, the park added six roller coasters, including SooperdooperLooper, the first complete-circuit, modern-day looping steel roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States, which opened in 1977. In 1996, Hersheypark added its third wooden roller coaster (Wild Cat and Comet being the first two), naming it Wildcat (initially The Wildcat) after the original Wild Cat.
Between the 1996 addition of Wildcat and 2015, the park added nine roller coasters.

Of the coasters that the park has had, only five are no longer in the park: a twin roller coaster called Toboggan (also called Twin Towers Toboggan or Twin Toboggans) which was located in Carousel Circle; a water coaster called Roller Soaker which was in Midway America and later The Boardwalk; a kiddie coaster with an oval track called Mini-Comet; the 1996 Wildcat; and the original Wild Cat. The station of the Wild Cat was located in the Minetown area where the Convoy ride is currently, with most of the out-and-back layout/structure built along the north side of Spring Creek between the base of Storm Runner&#x27;s first drop and the station for Trail Blazer. &quot;Candymonium&quot; is the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster at Hersheypark.

==== Pools ====

The park has had several pools, the first located next to Spring Creek in Comet Hollow, the area themed as The Hollow as of 2018. The first pool operated from 1908 until 1911, which included a toboggan-slide ride called Shoot-the-Chutes. This pool was replaced by a cement pool which opened in 1912 and remained in use through the 1928 season.

That pool was replaced by a new pool complex on the western edge of the park, which included a large bathhouse, one large pool and a smaller pool, as well as a beach-like area and a lighthouse. It operated until 1971, when it was closed at the start of the Hersheypark theme park conversion renovation.

Hersheypark did not add another pool until 2007 when The Boardwalk at Hersheypark opened. It is a small wave pool for children, called Bayside Pier. That was followed by the addition of a much larger wave pool, called The Shore, which opened in 2009.

=== Themed areas of the park ===
Hersheypark developed a number of themed areas, the first being Carousel Circle, Der Deitsch Platz, and Animal Garden in 1972, followed by Tower Plaza in 1975, Pioneer Frontier in 1985, Midway America in 1996, as well as The Boardwalk at Hersheypark in 2007. In 2014, Hersheypark merged several theme areas – Tudor Square, Rhineland, Founder&#x27;s Circle and Music Box Way, became an area called Founder&#x27;s Way, while the coal mining region themed area Minetown was re-themed as Kissing Tower Hill. The themed areas had featured different music to each area, such as polka-style songs being played in Der Deitsch Platz and Carousel Circle, country music being played in the Pioneer Frontier themed area, the Beach Boys being played near Tidal Force and later in The Boardwalk, as well as Ragtime and jazz music being played in Midway America. However, the music was phased into being the same across the park, except in The Boardwalk and Pioneer Frontier. In the summer of 2020, Hersheypark opened a new themed area called Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown, which included a new entrance plaza, ice cream parlor, flagship retail store, and a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard hyper coaster named Candymonium. This includes the first ever Starbucks inside the park.

== Attractions ==

=== Rides ===

Hersheypark has had 142 rides in the park&#x27;s history. There are currently 76 rides in operation. The park has featured 18 roller coasters, five of which no longer stand – Wild Cat, Wildcat, Twin Towers Toboggan, Mini Comet and Roller Soaker. The park had two concepts canceled during their many years of operation, the first in 1942 Flying Turns and Turbulence in 2005.

The first ride the park purchased was a Herschell carousel in 1908. The most recent coaster added is Wildcat&#x27;s Revenge, a hybrid roller coaster made by Rocky Mountain Construction, which opened in June 2023.

==== Height categories ====

Hersheypark uses Hershey Company products as names for each height range to determine who can ride which rides.

All measurements are in inches:
==== Thrill ride ratings ====

Hersheypark uses a ride ratings system to alert guests to the aggressiveness of the ride. The &quot;Ratings&quot; for each ride are as follows: (descriptions come from the 2007 edition of the map of Hersheypark)

=== Entertainment ===
Hersheypark features a number of entertainment shows in a number of venues including Hersheypark Aquatheatre and the Music Box Theatre, as well as strolling shows throughout the park. 12 resident shows are offered along with Spring, Summer, Halloween, and Christmas seasonal shows. A popular event offered each year from November to January is Hersheypark&#x27;s Christmas Candylane. The park also has an amphitheatre, but it has been out of use for several years.

=== Dining ===
There are facilities for accommodating particular dietary needs, including a kosher restaurant (Central PA&#x27;s Kosher Mart) and a variety of restaurants offering gluten-free rolls and bread. Groups can pre-arrange catering in one of six private picnic areas inside the park. Signs are posted prohibiting guests from bringing in outside food and drink. A casual sit-down restaurant called Hersheypark Place (formerly Tudor Grill) is located just outside the park. A Chickie and Pete&#x27;s Crab House restaurant and a frozen yogurt stand were added for the 2014 season. A Chick-fil-A restaurant (closed Sundays) was added for the 2017 season. In the 2020 expansion of hersheypark, they opened a new restaurant, called &quot;The Chocolatier&quot;.

=== ZooAmerica ===

Also included in the price of admission is access to ZooAmerica. It is open year-round and offers 11 acres of land to visit and walk throughout. It is smoke-free, as ZooAmerica houses &quot;more than 200 animals from five regions of North America&quot; and offers tours, birthday parties, and informational programs at varying costs, even having their own individual seasonal pass.

== Themed regions ==
Hersheypark is made up of seven themed areas, starting with Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown, an area which spans from outside the main gate, to around the area of the former Sky Ride station. From there, it becomes Founder&#x27;s Way, which leads to a junction where three sections – Kissing Tower Hill, The Hollow and Pioneer Frontier – meet and make up the central and southern end of the park, while two sections, Midway America and The Boardwalk, make up the northern end of the park.

=== Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown ===
On October 3, 2018, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts revealed its &quot;biggest announcement ever&quot; – a new section of the park called Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown. It features Candymonium, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard hypercoaster; the Chocolatier themed restaurant, bar, and patio; the Sweeterie confectionery kitchen; as well as a 10,000 square foot flagship boutique store, Hersheypark Supply Co, Milton&#x27;s Ice Cream Parlor, a 2,200-square-foot Starbucks store and a kettle corn location that is the largest in Hersheypark. Chocolatetown also features a unique Hershey&#x27;s Kisses fountain.

The project cost an estimated $150 million making this the largest capital expense in the park&#x27;s history. The new area sits on of land previously unoccupied by Hersheypark. Along with the expansion, Hershey announced plans to introduce a new entrance to the park, which will lead directly to the new section. The park&#x27;s Carrousel was relocated from Founder&#x27;s Way to Chocolatetown. The expansion, along with the rest of the park, opened on July 3, 2020, after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chocolatier Restaurant, The Sweeterie, and Milton&#x27;s Ice Cream Parlor were rescheduled to open in 2021. All three locations as well as the Hersheypark Supply Co. main gift shop are open year-round even when the park is closed.

It is now the first area one encounters when entering the park. It replaced the former Tudor Square and Rhineland buildings that were built during the park&#x27;s retheming in the 1970s. There are only a few remaining buildings from the Rhineland section towards the back of the area, where it becomes Founder&#x27;s Way.

=== Founder&#x27;s Way===
Founder&#x27;s Way is the second themed area of Hersheypark. Prior to the opening of Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown, it began outside of the main gate near Tram Circle and encompassed the former Tudor Square (1973–2013) and Rhineland (1973–2013) areas when they were merged with Founder&#x27;s Circle and Music Box Way. Now a few buildings from Rhineland still remain, including a few gift shops, the now-empty former station of the Sky Ride, Nathan&#x27;s, and Dispatch Pizzeria Express.

After the completion of Hershey&#x27;s Chocolatetown, the rather steep hill in this area was leveled off. Going into the main circle of the area is a statue of Milton S. Hershey and a surrounding fountain, which honors the chocolate maker and founder of the park. The center of this circle is where the carousel used to be before being moved to Chocolatetown. The red, white, and blue pavilion that it used to be under still remains and is the middle of a circle that has a number of rides on the outside of the circle. From 1972 until 2004, this area was known as Carousel Circle. In 2005, Carousel Circle became Founder&#x27;s Circle, until 2013, when it was merged with Music Box Way, Rhineland and Tudor Square.

The section of Founder&#x27;s Way beyond Carousel circle is an area formerly themed as Der Deitsch Platz. This is home to the 1906 Grille, a Get the Picture Souvenir Photo Stand, where guests can see and purchase pictures taken of them by park photographers throughout their day, as well as a Subway restaurant.

The next section that was merged, formerly known as Music Box Way, is home to the Music Box Theater, the first enclosed theater stage in the park. It also includes rides such as the Fender Bender bumper cars, the Pirate, Reese&#x27;s Cupfusion, as well as a number of kiddie rides. It is from this area that guests can access The Hollow, Pioneer Frontier, and a bridge leading to Kissing Tower Hill.

=== The Hollow ===
This section was originally named &quot;Comet Hollow&quot; after the oldest operating coaster in the park, Comet, and lies along Spring Creek. This is one of the oldest areas of Hersheypark; many rides have come and gone in this area. The park&#x27;s first water ride, the Mill Chute installed in 1929, was alongside the creek where Great Bear runs today. The original location for the bumper cars, then called the Auto Skooters, is now the SooperDooperLooper Sandwich Stop. There were giant slides on the hill where the Hersheypark Amphitheater is located. A Streco turnpike ride was located underneath the high bridge that crossed Spring Creek to Minetown. In 1932 the Park installed a Traver Tumble Bug ride next to the Mill Chute. It was removed in 1981 to make room for the Wave Swinger. The park&#x27;s carousel, before being moved to Carousel Circle in 1972, was located along the creek adjacent to the station of Comet. Before SooperDooperLooper came to Comet Hollow in 1977, a Himalaya ride was in that location, and before that, twin Eli Bridge Ferris wheels. A whip, and a station for the Electric Railroad were also located in Comet Hollow at one time.

One of Hersheypark&#x27;s most significant floods occurred in 1972 as a result of Hurricane Agnes. A number of rides were heavily damaged or destroyed as a result. These rides include the turnpike ride, the Mill Chute (which at the time of the flood was rethemed as the Lost River), and the giant slides. They were eventually replaced; the Coal Cracker (1973) and Twin Turnpike (1975) were put on higher ground in Minetown, and the Merry Derry Dip Fun Slide was put in Midway America twenty-five years later in 1997.

Today, The Hollow features three roller coasters, Comet, Skyrush and SooperDooperLooper. It also houses the Wave Swinger, Tea Cups, and Sweet Swing rides. Almost all of Great Bear&#x27;s track courses through The Hollow.

Beginning with the 2012 season and renovations being done to this area, the famous chocolate smell that was used in building materials was dampened due to concerns about safety. Additionally, the park changed the name of the once &#x27;Comet Hollow&#x27; to the present name of &#x27;The Hollow&#x27;.

=== Kissing Tower Hill ===
Until the start of the 2014 season, this area of the park had been called Minetown, which had been officially opened in 1990 with the additions of Convoy, Red Baron, Flying Falcon and Dinosaur-Go-Round. All except Dinosaur-Go-Round, Red Baron, and Flying Falcon are still in the area; Dinosaur-Go-Round was moved to Founder&#x27;s Circle for the 2007 season so the Frog Hoppers could be moved to its location to make room for the Boardwalk, and following the 2016 season, Red Baron was moved to Pioneer Frontier and Flying Falcon was removed completely to make room for Hershey Triple Tower. The section features many classic Hersheypark attractions, including the Sunoco Twin Turnpike, Coal Cracker flume ride, Kissing Tower and Great Bear. It is also home to the Overlook Arcade (formerly the Minetown Arcade), Overlook Food Court (formerly the Minetown Restaurant), Hersheypark Amphitheater, Hersheypark Aquatheater and the Hersheypark entrance to ZooAmerica. The Overlook Food Court Restaurant is a cafeteria-style place, and for many years was the only area in the park where alcohol was served. Alcohol is now also served at various locations in Pioneer Frontier and Midway America.

=== Pioneer Frontier ===
Pioneer Frontier is the southwestern-themed section of the park and includes four of the park&#x27;s roller coasters: Trailblazer (the second oldest in the park), Jolly Rancher Remix, Storm Runner, and Fahrenheit. It also includes the Frontier Flyers, The Howler, Mini Scrambler, Livery Stables, and Red Baron. It also has its own food court which features a wide variety of restaurants. The section previously included the area up to and including Tidal Force until 2007 when Tidal Force and Canyon River Rapids were rezoned into the new Boardwalk. However, the southern end of the section was expanded at this time, encompassing the Pirate (swinging ship), The Claw, and the Dry Gulch Railroad, all rezoned from Music Box Way. Pioneer Frontier is also home to the Playdome Arcade (formerly the Double &quot;R&quot; Cade, the Frontier Meetinghouse, and a Cinema Vision), which was newly remodeled for the 2018 season.

=== Midway America ===

Opened in 1996 as a homage to the classic midway fair, Midway America features four roller coasters, including Wildcat&#x27;s Revenge, a steel hybrid coaster which opened in 2023, Lightning Racer (a dueling wooden roller coaster), and two steel coasters, Wild Mouse, and Laff Trakk, a glow in the dark spinning family indoor coaster across from the Wild Mouse. The section also has Music Express, Merry Derry Dip Fun Slides, Ferris Wheel and three kiddies rides: Granny Bugs, Pony Parade, and Tiny Tracks.

=== The Boardwalk at Hersheypark ===
The Boardwalk at Hersheypark, a water park, was officially opened in 2007 and featured five new water park attractions along with three already standing rides: Roller Soaker, Tidal Force, and Canyon River Rapids. Canyon River Rapids and Tidal Force were rezoned from Pioneer Frontier to the Boardwalk. In 2009, the Boardwalk received an expansion known as the Seaquel which replaced Canyon River Rapids with Intercoastal Waterway (a lazy river), the Shore (a wave pool) and cabanas. Roller Soaker was removed for the 2013 season; however, the station was left up. That same year, the area was renovated and taken up by a kiddie spray ground and some tables. For the 2018 season, Hersheypark announced that two new water attractions would be in this area: Breaker&#x27;s Edge, a hydro-magnetic coaster slide that also counts as the park&#x27;s 14th coaster, and Whitecap Racer, the longest mat racer slide in the world which features two sets of twisting enclosed tubes. Breaker&#x27;s Edge uses the station that was formerly used by Roller Soaker.

== Bus access ==
Capital Area Transit provides direct access to/from Harrisburg with its HP bus during the summer season. Throughout the year, the 322 CAT route provides service to downtown Hershey and the Outlets at Hershey. Lebanon Transit offers direct access to/from Harrisburg on Route 8.

<text>The Fulbright Program, including the Fulbright–Hays Program, is one of several United States cultural exchange programs with the goal of improving intercultural relations, cultural diplomacy, and intercultural competence between the people of the United States and other countries through the mutual exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills. The program was founded by United States Senator J. William Fulbright in 1946, and has been considered as one of the most prestigious scholarships in the United States.

Via the program, competitively-selected American citizens including students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists, and artists may receive scholarships or grants to study, conduct research, teach, or exercise their talents abroad; and citizens of other countries may qualify to do the same in the United States. The program provides approximately 8,000 grants annually, comprising roughly 1,600 grants to U.S. students, 1,200 to U.S. scholars, 4,000 to foreign students, 900 to foreign visiting scholars, and several hundred to teachers and professionals.

The Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations such as the Institute of International Education and operates in over 160 countries around the world. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the Fulbright Program and receives funding from the United States Congress via annual appropriation bills. Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S. In 49 countries, a bi-national Fulbright Commission administers and oversees the Fulbright Program. In countries that have an active program but no Fulbright Commission, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. embassy oversees the Fulbright Program. More than 370,000 people have participated in the program since it began; 62 Fulbright alumni have won Nobel Prizes; 88 have won Pulitzer Prizes.

== History ==

In 1945, Senator J. William Fulbright proposed a bill to use the proceeds from selling surplus U.S. government war property to fund international exchange between the U.S. and other countries. With the crucial timing of the aftermath of the Second World War and with the pressing establishment of the United Nations, the Fulbright Program was an attempt to promote peace and understanding through educational exchange. The bill devised a plan to forgo the debts foreign countries amassed during the war in return for funding an international educational program. It was through the belief that this program would be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions and future leaders wherever they may be.

In August 1946, Congress created the Fulbright Program in what became the largest education exchange program in history. The program was expanded by the Mutual Educational And Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, known as Fulbright–Hays Act. It made possible participation in international fairs and expositions, including trade and industrial fairs; translations; funding for American studies programs; funds to promote medical, scientific, cultural, and educational research and development; and modern foreign language training.

The program operates on a bi-national basis; each country has entered into an agreement with the U.S. government. The first countries to sign agreements were China in 1947 and Burma, the Philippines, and Greece in 1948.

In March 2024, the Russian government declared the Institute of International Education (IIE) and Cultural Vistas as &quot;undesirable&quot; in Russia. This decision effectively ended the Fulbright Program, which had been established in the USSR during the 1973–74 academic year. 

== Program ==


The Fulbright Program exchanges scholars and students with numerous countries in bilateral partnerships managed by commissions for each country. It provides funding for U.S. persons to visit other countries in the U.S. Student Program, U.S. Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, and others, and enables foreign nationals to visit the United States in programs such as the Foreign Student Program, Visiting Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program.

Candidates recommended for Fulbright grants have high academic achievement, a compelling project proposal or statement of purpose, demonstrated leadership potential, and flexibility and adaptability to interact successfully with the host community.

Fulbright grants are awarded in almost all academic disciplines, except clinical medical research involving patient contact. Fulbright grantees&#x27; fields of study span the fine arts, humanities, social sciences, mathematics, natural and physical sciences, and professional and applied sciences.

=== Student grants ===
* The Fulbright Degree Program funds graduate education for international students wanting to study in the United States. Students apply for the scholarship in their home country and after a long process, they can pursue a Masters or Ph.D. program in the United States.
* The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers fellowships for U.S. graduating college seniors, graduate students, young professionals, and artists to research, study, or teach English abroad for one academic year. The program facilitates cultural exchange through direct interaction on an individual basis in the classroom, field, home, and in routine tasks, allowing the grantee to gain an appreciation of others&#x27; viewpoints and beliefs, the way they do things, and the way they think. The application period opens in the spring of each year. Since the inaugural class in 1949, Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Columbia, and Michigan have been the top producers of U.S. Student Program scholars. Michigan has been the leading producer since 2005.

* The Fulbright-mtvU Fellowships award up to four U.S. students the opportunity to study the power of music as a cultural force abroad. Fellows conduct research for one academic year on projects of their own design about a chosen musical aspect. They share their experiences during their Fulbright year via video reports, blogs, and podcasts.
* The Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship provides the opportunity for U.S. students to serve in professional placements in foreign government ministries or institutions to gain hands-on public sector experience in participating foreign countries.
* The Fulbright Schuman Program awards scholarships to American citizens for research in the European Union with a focus on EU affairs/policy, or the US-EU transatlantic agenda.

=== Scholar grants ===
* The Fulbright Distinguished Chair Awards comprise approximately forty distinguished lecturing, distinguished research and distinguished lecturing/research awards ranging from three to 12 months. Fulbright Distinguished Chair Awards are viewed as among the most prestigious appointments in the U.S. Fulbright Scholar Program. Candidates should be eminent scholars and have a significant publication and teaching record.

The Fulbright Foreign Student Program enables graduate students, young professionals and artists from abroad to conduct research and study in the United States. Some scholarships are renewed after the initial year of study.

=== Fulbright–Hays Program ===
The Fulbright–Hays Program is a component of the Fulbright Program funded by a congressional appropriation to the United States Department of Education. It awards grants to individual U.S. K through 14 pre-teachers, teachers and administrators, pre-doctoral students, and post-doctoral faculty, as well as to U.S. institutions and organizations. Funding supports research and training efforts overseas, which focus on non-western foreign languages and area studies. Four Fulbright–Hays grants currently make awards: Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad, Fulbright–Hays Faculty Research Abroad, Fulbright–Hays Group Projects Abroad and Fulbright–Hays Seminars Abroad.

Fulbright–Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad fellowships provide grants to U.S. colleges and universities to fund individual doctoral students who conduct research in other countries, in modern foreign languages and area studies for periods of 6–12 months. Fulbright–Hays Faculty Research Abroad fellowships provide grants to U.S. colleges and universities to fund individual faculty who conduct research in other countries, in modern foreign languages and area studies for periods of 3–12 months. Fulbright–Hays Group Projects Abroad provides grants to support overseas projects in training, research, and curriculum development in modern foreign languages and area studies for teachers, students, and faculty engaged in a common endeavor, including short-term seminars, curriculum development, group research or study, or advanced intensive language programs. Fulbright–Hays Seminars Abroad provides individual U.S. educators and administrators opportunities to go abroad as part of a group in the summer to participate in immersive educational and cultural activities and thereby improve their understanding of the peoples and cultures of other countries. Based on their seminar experiences, participants develop cross-cultural curricula for their home educational contexts.

== Administration ==
The program is coordinated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) of the U.S. Department of State under policy guidelines established by the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board (FSB), with the help of 50 bi-national Fulbright commissions, U.S. embassies, and cooperating organizations in the U.S.

The Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board is a twelve-member board of educational and public leaders appointed by the President of the United States that determines general policy and direction for the Fulbright Program and approves all candidates nominated for Fulbright Scholarships.

Bi-national Fulbright commissions and foundations, most of which are funded jointly by the U.S. and partner governments, develop priorities for the program, including the numbers and categories of grants. More specifically, they plan and implement educational exchanges, recruit and nominate candidates for fellowships; designate qualified local educational institutions to host Fulbrighters; fundraise; engage alumni; support incoming U.S. Fulbrighters; and, in many countries, operate an information service for the public on educational opportunities in the United States.

In a country active in the program without a Fulbright commission, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy administers the Fulbright Program, including recruiting and nominating candidates for grants to the U.S., overseeing U.S. Fulbrighters on their grant in the country, and engaging alumni.

Established in 1919 in the aftermath of World War I, the Institute of International Education was created to catalyze educational exchange. In 1946, the U.S. Department of State invited IIE to administer the graduate student component and CIES to administer the faculty component of the Fulbright Program—IIE&#x27;s largest program to date.

The Council for International Exchange of Scholars is a division of IIE that administers the Fulbright Scholar Program.

AMIDEAST administers Fulbright Foreign Student grants for grantees from the Middle East and North Africa, excluding Israel.

<text>The Maasai Creed is a creed composed in 1960 by the Maasai people of East Africa in collaboration with missionaries from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. An early publication of the Maasai Creed appears in Fr. Vincent J. Donovan, &quot;Christianity Rediscovered&quot;, in which Donovan tells of his work among the Maasai through which they developed a contextualized understanding of Christianity. 

==Text==

We believe in the one High God of love who created the beautiful world and everything good in it. He created man and wanted man to be happy in the world. God loves the world and every nation and tribe in the world. We have known this God in darkness, and we now know God in the light. God promised in his book the Bible that he would save the world and all the nations and tribes.

We believe that God made good on his promise by sending his son, Jesus Christ, a man by the flesh, a Jew by tribe, born poor in a little village, who left his home and was always on safari, doing good, curing people by the power of God, teaching about God and man, showing that the meaning of religion is love. He was rejected by his people, tortured and nailed hands and feet to a cross, and died. He lay buried in the grave, but the hyenas did not touch him, and on the third day he rose from the grave. He ascended to the skies. He is lord.

We believe that all our sins are forgiven through him. All who have faith in him must be sorry about their sins, be baptized in the Holy Spirit of God, live by the rules of love and share the bread together, to announce the good news to others until Jesus comes again. We are waiting for him. He is alive. He lives. This we believe. Amen.

<text>James Ferrier Pryde (30 March 1866 – 24 February 1941) was a British artist. A number of his paintings are in public collections, but there have been few exhibitions of his work. He is principally remembered as one of the Beggarstaffs, his artistic partnership with William Nicholson, and for the poster designs and other graphic work they made between 1893 and 1899, which influenced graphic design for many years.

== Life ==

James Ferrier &quot;Jimmy&quot; Pryde was born at 23 London Street, Edinburgh, on 30 March 1866. He was the only son of the six children of David Pryde (1834–1907), who was headmaster of Edinburgh Ladies&#x27; College from 1870 to 1891, and his wife Barbara &quot;née&quot; Lauder (born 1833 or 1834), whose father William was a brother of the famous Scottish artists Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. The family moved to 10 Fettes Row, Edinburgh, in 1872. Pryde attended George Watson&#x27;s Boys&#x27; College, and from 1885 to 1888 studied at the Royal Scottish Academy, where he had first exhibited in 1884. He was encouraged to paint by the Glasgow school painters James Guthrie and Edward Arthur Walton. In about 1899 he went to Paris to study under William-Adolphe Bouguereau at the Académie Julian, but the dismal and crowded atelier with its smell of tobacco smoke, stove-oil and human sweat did not please him, and after three months he returned to Scotland. In 1890 he went to London, and began to make pastel drawings in a style influenced by that of James McNeill Whistler.

In 1899 Pryde married Marian Symons, a musician; their daughter Betty was born in 1903. The marriage ended in separation in 1914.

== Work ==

In 1893 his sister Mabel married William Nicholson, four years after the two had met while studying at Hubert Herkomer&#x27;s school of art in Bushey, in Hertfordshire. In the same year Pryde and Nicholson formed the Beggarstaff partnership, which lasted until 1899, and produced innovative poster designs and signboards.

Between 1894 and 1899 Pryde tried his hand as an actor, playing small parts in several plays. Ellen Terry&#x27;s son Edward Gordon Craig, with whom Pryde toured Scotland in 1895, described &#x27;Jimmy&#x27; as &#x27;one of the best painters who ever lived&#x27; and &#x27;one of the biggest hearts on earth&#x27;. But Craig had no illusions about Pryde&#x27;s dramatic ability: as an actor he never really existed: but the idea of acting, the idea of the theatre – or rather the smell of the place, meant a lot to him. Yes, I think he got much &#x27;inspiration&#x27; from the boards – and the thought and feel of it all, as of a magical place ...

He was an associate of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers from 1901 and vice-president in 1921. His first one-man exhibition was held at the Baillie Gallery in 1911. He also exhibited at the Goupil Gallery, the Leicester Galleries, the Grosvenor Gallery, London Salon, New English Art Club, Royal Hibernian Academy, Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and Royal Scottish Academy. In 1934 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters.

His only work as a theatre designer was for a production at the Savoy Theatre of &quot;Othello&quot; in 1930.

He became ill in 1939, and died on 24 February 1941 in St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

== Reception ==

Pryde did not belong to any artistic school or movement. His work was highly regarded in his lifetime; from 1912 he had the patronage of Annie Pearson, wife of Weetman Pearson, and from 1917 known as Viscountess Cowdray.

In 1922 Frank Rutter, in his &quot;Some Contemporary Artists&quot;, described him as &quot;stupendous&quot;. He had only two one-man shows, in 1911 at the Baillie Gallery and in 1933 at the Leicester Galleries. In 1949 an Arts Council Memorial Exhibition toured Edinburgh, Brighton and London. His work as a painter received little subsequent attention until 1992, when an exhibition was held at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.

<text>Joseph Jenkins Roberts (March 15, 1809 – February 24, 1876) was an African-American merchant who emigrated to Liberia in 1829, where he became a politician. Elected as the first (1848–1856) and seventh (1872–1876) president of Liberia after independence, he was the first man of African descent to govern the country, serving previously as governor from 1841 to 1848. He later returned to office following the 1871 Liberian coup d&#x27;état. Born free in Norfolk, Virginia, Roberts emigrated as a young man with his mother, siblings, wife, and child to the young West African colony. He opened a trading firm in Monrovia and later engaged in politics.

==Early life==
Joseph Jenkins Roberts was born free in Norfolk, Virginia, the second-oldest of seven children. His father was said to be a planter of Welsh origin. Joseph&#x27;s mother Amelia, described as a &quot;mulatto&quot; who was quite fair, was the planter&#x27;s slave mistress or concubine, and he freed her when she was still young, before Joseph was born. Amelia gave all but one of her children the middle name of Jenkins, which suggests that was likely the surname of their biological father.

After receiving her freedom, Amelia moved and married James Roberts, a free man of color. Roberts gave her children his surname and raised them as his own. Roberts owned a boating business on the James River. By the time of his death, he had acquired substantial wealth for a free man of color at the time.

Joseph Roberts and his siblings were estimated to be of seven-eighths European ancestry. The Liberian historian Abayomi Karnga explained in 1926: &quot;He was not really black; he was an octoroon and could have easily passed for a white man.&quot; However, his native Virginia classed him as a person of color because he was born to a mother of African descent.

The family moved to Petersburg, an industrial city on the upper James River with a substantial population of free people of color. As a boy, Joseph began to work in his stepfather&#x27;s business, handling goods on a flatboat that transported materials from Petersburg to Norfolk, Virginia on the James River. Shortly after the family relocated, his stepfather James Roberts died. Joseph continued to work in his family&#x27;s business, but also served as an apprentice in a barber shop. The owner of the barber shop, William Colson, was also a minister and one of Virginia&#x27;s best-educated black residents. He gave Roberts access to his private library, which provided much of the youth&#x27;s early education.

==Marriage and family==
In 1828, Roberts married an 18-year-old woman named Sarah. They had an infant child whom they took with them when they emigrated the next year to the new colony of Liberia under the auspices of the American Colonization Society. Both Sarah and the child died in the first year of living in the colony. There was a very high rate of mortality due to disease among settlers to the new colony.

Some time after his wife&#x27;s death, Roberts married again, to Jane Rose Waring, in 1836 in Monrovia, Liberia. She was a daughter of Colston Waring and Harriet Graves, other Virginians who had emigrated to the colony.

==Emigrating to Liberia==

After hearing about the American Colonization Society&#x27;s efforts in creating the colony of Liberia on the West African coast, Roberts decided to join a group of fellow Virginians preparing to leave for Monrovia, the capital of the young colony. Although Roberts was educated and a relatively successful merchant by the time he and his family emigrated, the restrictions in Virginia on free people of color played an important role in his decision.

The Roberts family was deeply religious, and they felt called to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Africa. On February 9, 1829, they sailed for Africa on the ship &quot;Harriet&quot;, along with Roberts&#x27;s mother and five of his six siblings. Another passenger on the same ship was James Spriggs Payne, who later became a leader and was elected as Liberia&#x27;s fourth president.

Several years before leaving for Liberia, Roberts established a business with his friend William Nelson Colson from Petersburg. Known as Roberts, Colson, &amp; Company, the partnership continued and even expanded after Roberts emigrated, exporting palm products, camwood, and ivory to the United States and trading American goods at a company store in Monrovia. Roberts made several trips to the United States, including stops in New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond as a representative of the firm. In 1835, Colson emigrated to Liberia, but died shortly after his arrival. Expanding into coastal trade, the Roberts family became successful members of the local establishment.

During this time, Joseph&#x27;s brother, John Wright Roberts, entered the ministry of the Liberian Methodist Church. Later he became a bishop. After starting as a trader, the youngest brother, Henry Roberts, studied medicine at the Berkshire Medical College in Massachusetts. Joseph Roberts was successful enough to pay for his brother&#x27;s tuition. Henry returned to Liberia to work as a physician.

In 1833, Joseph Roberts became high sheriff of the colony. One of his responsibilities was to organize militias to travel to the interior to collect taxes from the indigenous peoples and put down their raids against areas under colonial rule. In 1839, the American Colonization Society appointed Roberts as vice governor.

Two years later, after the death of governor Thomas Buchanan, Roberts was appointed as the first African-American governor of Liberia. Roberts’ skills as a diplomat and a politician soon became apparent.  He became convinced that Liberia had the potential. Then the legislature called for a referendum, in which voters chose independence. On July 26, 1847, a group of eleven delegates declared Liberia independent. He won the first presidential election on October 5, 1847, and was sworn into office on January 3, 1848, with Nathaniel Brander as vice president.

==First presidency (1848–1856)==

Roberts was re-elected three more times to serve a total of eight years, until he lost the election in 1855 to Vice President Benson.

Attempts to found a state based upon some 3,000 settlers proved difficult. Some coastal ethnic groups were converted to Christianity and learned English, but most of the indigenous Africans of the area retained their traditional religions and languages. They also continued to take part in the Atlantic Slave Trade operated by European slavers along the coast. The slave trade continued illegally from ports along the Liberian coast, but the British Royal Navy along with that of the United States finally helped to close it down in the 1850s.

===Foreign relations===

Roberts spent the first year of his presidency attempting to attain recognition from the United States, where it was opposed mainly by southern congressmen, as well as several European nations with neighboring colonies. In 1848 he traveled to Europe to meet Queen Victoria and other heads of state. The UK was the first country to recognize Liberia as an independent country, followed by France in 1848 or 1852 (accounts differ). In 1849, the German cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck recognized the new nation, as did Kingdom of Portugal, Empire of Brazil, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Austrian Empire. Norway and Sweden did so in either 1849 or 1863, Haiti in either 1849 or 1864, Denmark in either 1849 or 1869 (accounts differ).

The United States withheld recognition until February 5, 1862, during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Reportedly, the government had reservations over the political and social statuses of black diplomats in Washington, D.C. Soon after the recognition of Liberia&#x27;s independence, slavery was abolished in Washington, D.C.

===Relations with Indigenous Groups===
In 1854 Maryland Colony, which was established adjacent to Liberia, declared its independence from the Maryland State Colonization Society but did not become part of the Republic of Liberia. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro rivers. In 1856, it requested military aid from Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples. The latter were resisting the Maryland colonists&#x27; efforts to control their trade in slaves and other goods. Roberts assisted the Maryland colony, and a joint military campaign by the two groups of African-American colonists resulted in victory. In 1857, the year after Roberts left office for the first time, the Republic of Maryland joined Liberia as Maryland County.

During his presidency, Roberts expanded the borders of Liberia along the coast and made attempts to assimilate the indigenous people surrounding Monrovia into Americo-Liberian culture, largely through directed education and religious conversion.

===Economy, nation building===
The settlers built schools and Liberia College (which later became the University of Liberia). During these early years, agriculture, shipbuilding, and trade flourished.

===Assessment===
Roberts has been described as a talented leader with diplomatic skills. His leadership was instrumental in gaining independence and sovereignty for Liberia. Later in his career, his diplomatic skills helped him to deal effectively with the indigenous peoples and to maneuver in the complex field of international law and relations.

==Between presidencies==

After his first presidency, Roberts served for fifteen years as a major general in the Liberian Army, as well as a diplomatic representative of the nation to France and Great Britain. In 1862, he co-founded Liberia College in Monrovia, where he served as its first president until 1876. Roberts frequently traveled to the United States to raise funds for the college. Until his death, he held a professorship in jurisprudence and international law.

==Second presidency (1872–1876)==
In 1871, President Edward James Roye was deposed by elements loyal to the Republican Party on the grounds that he was planning to cancel the upcoming elections. Roberts, one of the Republican Party&#x27;s leaders, won the ensuing presidential election and returned to office in 1872. He served for two terms until 1876. While Roberts was incapacitated by illness from 1875 until early 1876, Vice President Anthony W. Gardiner served as acting president.

In the 1860s and 1870s, escalating economic difficulties weakened Monrovia&#x27;s dominance over the coastal indigenous populations, leading to several violent conflicts. Conditions worsened following Roberts&#x27;s second presidency, as the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugar cane, camwood, and timber.

==Inheritance and legacy==
Roberts died on February 24, 1876, less than two months after his final term as president ended. He was buried in Palm Grove Cemetery in Monrovia. His grave and that of some of his relatives, including brother Henry, are located in a walled enclosure on the northeast side of the cemetery. In his will, he left $10,000 and his estate to the educational system of Liberia. Today, Liberia&#x27;s main airport, Roberts International Airport, as well as the town of Robertsport and Roberts Street in Monrovia are named in his honor.

His face is depicted on the Liberian ten dollar bill, introduced in 2000, and the old five dollar bill in circulation between 1989 and 1999.

His birthday, March 15, is a national holiday in Liberia.

<text>The phrase &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; (BLTC) is a variant of a DuPont advertising slogan, &quot;Better Things for Better Living...Through Chemistry&quot;. DuPont adopted it in 1935 and it was their slogan until 1982 when the &quot;Through Chemistry&quot; part was dropped. Since 1999, their slogan has been &quot;The miracles of science&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; was used on products that were not affiliated with DuPont to circumvent trademark infringement. This transmutation is now more commonly used than the original. This statement is used for commentary on several different topics, from the promotion of prescription or recreational drugs, to the praise of chemicals and plastics, to the sarcastic criticism of the same.

DuPont used the &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; slogan not to promote particular products, but to change viewers&#x27; opinions about the role of business in society. In the words of DuPont&#x27;s advertising director, Charles Hackett, the advertisements sought to address &quot;unspoken fears of bigness in business&quot;, which were based on &quot;an emotional rather than a rational foundation&quot;.

The phrase has since been used in popular culture as the name of a film and of music albums, sometimes as a euphemistic reference to recreational drug use.

<doc id="333925" wikidata="Q1428558" url="?curid=333925" title="Handicap principle">
<text>The handicap principle is a disputed hypothesis proposed by the Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi in 1975. It is meant to explain how &quot;signal selection&quot; during mate choice may lead to &quot;honest&quot; or reliable signalling between male and female animals which have an obvious motivation to bluff or deceive each other. The handicap principle suggests that secondary sexual characteristics are costly signals which must be reliable, as they cost the signaller resources that individuals with less of a particular trait could not afford. The handicap principle further proposes that animals of greater biological fitness signal this through handicapping behaviour, or morphology that effectively lowers overall fitness. The central idea is that sexually selected traits function like conspicuous consumption, signalling the ability to afford to squander a resource. Receivers then know that the signal indicates quality, because inferior-quality signallers are unable to produce such wastefully extravagant signals. 

The handicap principle is supported by game theory modelling representing situations such as nestlings begging for food, predator-deterrent signalling, and threat displays. However, honest signals are not necessarily costly, undermining the theoretical basis for the handicap principle, which remains unconfirmed by empirical evidence.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The handicap principle was proposed in 1975 by the Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi. He argued that mate choice involving what he called &quot;signal selection&quot; would lead to &quot;honest&quot; or reliable signalling between male and female animals, even though they have an interest in bluffing or deceiving each other. The handicap principle asserts that secondary sexual characteristics are costly signals, which are reliable indicators of the signaller&#x27;s quality, since they cost the signaller resources that lower-quality individuals could not afford. The generality of the phenomenon is a matter of some debate and disagreement, and Zahavi&#x27;s views on the scope and importance of handicaps in biology have not been accepted by the mainstream. Nevertheless, the idea has been very influential, with most researchers in the field believing that the theory explains some aspects of animal communication.

=== Grafen&#x27;s signaling game model ===

The handicap principle was initially controversial, with the British biologist John Maynard Smith a notable early critic of Zahavi&#x27;s ideas. However, the handicap principle gained wider acceptance because it is supported by game theory models, most notably the Scottish biologist Alan Grafen&#x27;s 1990 signalling game model. This was essentially a rediscovery of the Canadian-American economist Michael Spence&#x27;s job market signalling model, where the job applicant signals their quality by declaring a costly education. In Grafen&#x27;s model, the courting male&#x27;s quality is signalled by investment in an extravagant trait—similar to the peacock&#x27;s tail. The signal is reliable if the cost to the signaller of producing it is proportionately lower for higher-quality signallers than for lower-quality ones.

A series of papers by the American biologist Thomas Getty showed that Grafen&#x27;s proof of the handicap principle depends on the critical, simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, analogous to the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency. This is illustrated in the figures from Johnstone 1997, which show that the optimum signalling levels are different for low- and high-quality signallers. The validity of the assumption that costs and benefits are additive has been contested, in its application to the evolution of sexually selected signals. It can be reasoned that since fitness depends on the production of offspring, this is a multiplicative rather than additive function of reproductive success.

Further game theoretical models demonstrated the evolutionary stability of handicapped signals in nestlings&#x27; begging calls, in predator-deterrent signals and in threat-displays. In the classic handicap models of begging in game theory, all players are assumed to pay the same amount to produce a signal of a given level of intensity, but differ in the relative value of eliciting the desired response (donation) from the receiver. The hungrier the baby bird, the more food is of value to it, and the higher the optimal signalling level (the louder its chirping).

=== Cheap talk models without handicaps ===

Counter-examples to handicap models predate handicap models themselves. Models of signals (such as threat displays) without any handicapping costs show that what biologists call cheap talk may be an evolutionarily stable form of communication. Analysis of some begging models shows that non-communication strategies are not only evolutionarily stable, but lead to higher payoffs for both players. In human mate choice, mathematical analyses including Monte Carlo simulations suggest that costly traits ought to be more attractive to the other sex and much rarer than non-costly traits.

It was soon discovered that honest signals need not be costly at the honest equilibrium, even under conflict of interest. This conclusion was first shown in discrete models and then in continuous models. Similar results were obtained in conflict models: threat displays need not be handicaps to be honest and evolutionarily stable.

=== Unworkable theory lacking empirical evidence ===

In 2015, Simon Huttegger and colleagues wrote that the distinction between &quot;indexes&quot; (unfakable signals) and &quot;fakable signals&quot;, crucial to the argument for the handicap principle, is an artefact of signalling models. They demonstrated that absent that dichotomy, cost could not be the only factor controlling signalling behaviours, and that indeed it was &quot;probably not the most important&quot; factor acting against deception.

Dustin J. Penn and Szabolcs Számadó stated in 2019 that there was still no empirical evidence for evolutionary pressure for wasteful biology or acts, and proposed that the handicap principle should be abandoned.

== Predictions and interpretations ==

The handicap principle predicts that a sexual ornament, or any other signal such as visibly risky behavior, must be costly if it is to accurately advertise a trait of relevance to an individual with conflicting interests. Typical examples of handicapped signals include bird songs, the peacock&#x27;s tail, courtship dances, and bowerbird bowers. American scientist Jared Diamond has proposed that certain risky human behaviours, such as bungee jumping, may be expressions of instincts that have evolved through the operation of the handicap principle. Zahavi has invoked the gift-giving potlatch ceremony as a human example of the handicap principle in action: the conspicuous generosity is costly. This interpretation of potlatch can be traced to Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s use of the ceremony in his book &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; as an example of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;.

The handicap principle gains further support by providing interpretations for behaviours that fit into a single unifying gene-centered view of evolution and making earlier explanations based on group selection obsolete. A classic example is that of &quot;stotting&quot; in gazelles. This behaviour consists in the gazelle initially running slowly and jumping high when threatened by a predator such as a lion or cheetah. The explanation based on group selection was that such behaviour might be adapted to alerting other gazelle to a cheetah&#x27;s presence or might be part of a collective behaviour pattern of the group of gazelle to confuse the cheetah. Instead, Zahavi proposed that each gazelle was communicating that it was a fitter individual than its fellows.

=== Signals to members of the same species ===
Zahavi studied in particular the Arabian babbler, a highly social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which appears to behave altruistically. Its helping-at-the-nest behavior, where non-parent birds assist in feeding, guarding, and caring for nestlings, often occurs among unrelated individuals. This, therefore, cannot be explained by kin selection, natural selection acting on genes that close relatives share with the altruistic individual. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviors according to his signalling theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition may be explained by competitive altruism.

French biologist Patrice David showed that in the stalk-eyed fly species &quot;Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni&quot;, genetic variation underlies the response to environmental stress, such as variable food quality, of a male sexual ornament, eye span. He showed that some male genotypes always develop large eye spans, but others reduce eye span in proportion to environmental worsening. David inferred that female mate choice yields genetic benefits for offspring.

=== Signals to other species ===

Signals may be directed at predators, with the function of showing that pursuit will probably be unprofitable. Stotting, for instance, is a form of energetic jumping that certain gazelles do when they sight a predator. As this behavior gives no evident benefit and would seem to waste resources (diminishing the gazelle&#x27;s head start if chased by the predator), it appeared likely to be selected against. However, it made sense when seen as a pursuit deterrence signal to predators. By investing a little energy to show a lion that it has the fitness necessary to avoid capture, a gazelle reduces the likelihood that it will have to evade the lion in an actual pursuit. The lion, faced with the demonstration of fitness, might decide that it would fail to catch this gazelle, and thus choose to avoid a probably wasted pursuit. The benefit to the gazelle is twofold. First, for the small amount of energy invested in the stotting, the gazelle might not have to expend the tremendous energy required to evade the lion. Second, if the lion is in fact capable of catching this gazelle, the gazelle&#x27;s bluff may lead to its survival that day (in the event the bluff succeeds). However, the mathematical biologist John Maynard Smith commented that other explanations were possible, such as that it was an honest signal of fitness, or an honest signal that the predator had been detected, and it was hard to see how stotting could be a handicap.

Another example is provided by larks, some of which discourage merlins by sending a similar message: they sing while being chased, telling their predator that they will be difficult to capture.

=== Immunocompetence handicaps ===

The theory of immunocompetence handicaps suggests that androgen-mediated traits accurately signal condition due to the immunosuppressive effects of androgens. This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of ornamental traits and other tissues, including the immune system, or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression of the immune system enhances fertility. Healthy individuals can afford to suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, at the same time augmenting secondary sexual traits and displays. A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support.

<doc id="333929" wikidata="Q7287458" url="?curid=333929" title="Ralph Engelstad">
<text>Ralph Louis Engelstad (January 28, 1930 – November 26, 2002) was an American businessman who owned the Imperial Palace casino-hotels in Las Vegas and in Biloxi, Mississippi. He also owned the Kona Kai motel in Las Vegas, which later became the Klondike Hotel and Casino. He was also the donor for the construction of the $104 million Ralph Engelstad Arena for his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and another arena bearing his name in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. Engelstad was also a co-developer of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Engelstad was one of the very few independent casino-hotel owners in Las Vegas.

==Early years==
Engelstad was born on January 28, 1930, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. He was one of five children born to Christian and Madeline (Thill) Engelstad. His grandfather, Peder was a Norwegian immigrant from Vang, Hedmark.

During high school, Engelstad worked a summer job at AGSCO farm supply company, where his father was a salesman. It was usually long and hard work, taking place on farms and requiring the workers to assemble steel buildings from morning to night.

In 1954, he graduated from the University of North Dakota (UND) with a degree in Business. While at UND, Engelstad also played goalie for the school hockey team and even received a tryout with the Chicago Blackhawks. After graduation, he went on to marry Betty Stocker of East Grand Forks. The two went on to have a daughter, Kris.

== Business career ==
In the 1950s, Engelstad founded his own construction company: Engelstad Construction. Engelstad became a millionaire at the age of twenty-nine, fulfilling his hope to become a millionaire by the age of thirty. In 1959, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where his construction company had secured government contracts to build FHA homes.

In 1965, he purchased the Thunderbird Field airport and later acquired vacant land nearby. In 1967, he sold 145 acres, including the airport, to billionaire Howard Hughes for $2 million. Engelstad used the money to purchase the Kona Kai motel on the Las Vegas Strip. He sold the motel in 1975 for $1.2 million, and it would later become the Klondike Hotel and Casino.

In 1971, he purchased the Flamingo Capri Motel, also on the Las Vegas Strip. He added a casino in 1972, and later renamed the property to the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in 1979. By 1989, he was worth an estimated $300 million. In 1997, he opened a second Imperial Palace resort in Biloxi, Mississippi.

In 1996, Engelstad joined with Bill Bennett (owner of the Sahara Hotel and Casino) to build the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which they later sold to Speedway Motorsports in 1998.

After a lengthy affliction with lung cancer, Engelstad died at his home in Las Vegas on November 26, 2002.

== Awards ==
Ralph Engelstad was honored with multiple awards throughout his life, including &quot;National Employer of the Year&quot; from the President&#x27;s Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities; &quot;Employer of the Year&quot; from the Southwest Business, Industry and Rehabilitation Association; and &quot;Humanitarian of the Year Award&quot; from the International Gaming &amp; Business Exposition. In 2002, Engelstad was inducted into the North Dakota Entrepreneur Hall of Fame for his contributions to the construction, casino and entertainment industries.

==Nazi controversy==
Engelstad was a controversial figure. He raised accusations of being sympathetic to Nazism owing to his collection of Nazi memorabilia stored in a private room, which he referred to as his &quot;war room&quot;, within his Imperial Palace hotel-casino. After discovery of the memorabilia, Engelstad agreed to sell it rather than put it on display. In an apology letter to the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas, Engelstad said &quot;I now feel I have done what I can and apologized for what I cannot do&quot;. In addition to the memorabilia he stored on display in his &quot;war room&quot;, a printing plate was found within his hotel that was used to make bumper stickers that read &quot;Hitler Was Right&quot;.

===Hitler birthday parties===
On April 20 in 1986 and 1988, he hosted parties to celebrate Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday at his casino in Las Vegas that featured bartenders in T-shirts reading &quot;Adolf Hitler — European tour 1939-45&quot;. Because of this, in 1989, the Nevada Gaming Commission fined Engelstad $1.5 million &quot;for actions that damaged the reputation and image of Nevada&#x27;s gaming industry.&quot; Engelstad apologized publicly for the parties, saying they were &quot;stupid, insensitive and held in bad taste&quot;, but the row was not to be his last controversial move.

==Fighting Sioux controversy==

Engelstad embroiled himself in the fight over the Fighting Sioux logo when he built a $104 million arena on the University of North Dakota campus for the Fighting Sioux hockey program. Midway in its construction, Engelstad threatened to withdraw funding if the long-standing nickname were to be changed. The logo was placed in thousands of instances in the arena, making the prospect of removal a costly measure. Later, Engelstad placed the stadium under private (rather than University) management and stipulated that the Fighting Sioux motif be kept indefinitely. An Engelstad family trust continues to own the arena and rents it to the University.

The North Dakota Board of Higher Education ruled on April 8, 2010, to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname in response to pressure from the NCAA. On February 8, 2012 the &quot;repeal of the repeal&quot; took place. After 17,213 North Dakota residents signed a petition bringing the debate over the nickname to a statewide vote, UND resumed use of the nickname. On June 14, 2012, the nickname was repealed again after a vote held on June 11, 2012, on whether to keep or retire the nickname resulted in 67.35% of North Dakota voters chose to retire the &quot;Fighting Sioux&quot; name and American Indian head logo as a result of negative consequences resulting from impending NCAA sanctions.

==Philanthropy==
Ralph and his wife, Betty, created the Engelstad Foundation in 2002. Since its inception, the foundation has provided more than $300 million in grants to organizations focused on animal compassion, at-risk individuals, education, historical preservation, medical research and support, people with disabilities and veterans. Notable donations to organizations span Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, and Utah.

<doc id="333932" wikidata="Q1570586" url="?curid=333932" title="Royal Albert Bridge">
<text>The Royal Albert Bridge is a railway bridge which spans the River Tamar in England between Plymouth, Devon and Saltash, Cornwall. Its unique design consists of two lenticular iron trusses above the water, with conventional plate-girder approach spans. This gives it a total length of . It carries the Cornish Main Line railway in and out of Cornwall. It is adjacent to the Tamar Bridge which opened in 1961 to carry the A38 road.

The Royal Albert Bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Surveying started in 1848 and construction commenced in 1854. The first main span was positioned in 1857 and the completed bridge was opened by Prince Albert on 2 May 1859. Brunel died later that year and his name was then placed above the portals at either end of the bridge as a memorial. During the 20th century the approach spans were replaced, and the main spans strengthened. It has attracted sightseers since its construction and has appeared in many paintings, photographs, guidebooks, postage stamps and on the UK £2 coin. Anniversary celebrations took place in 1959 and 2009.

==Cornwall Railway==
Two rival schemes for a railway to Falmouth, Cornwall, were proposed in the 1830s. The &#x27;central&#x27; scheme was a route from Exeter around the north of Dartmoor, an easy route to construct but with little intermediate traffic. The other, the &#x27;coastal&#x27; scheme, was a line with many engineering difficulties but which could serve the important naval town of Devonport and the industrial area around St Austell. The central scheme was backed by the London and South Western Railway while the coastal scheme was promoted by the Cornwall Railway and backed by the Great Western Railway which wanted it to join up with the South Devon Railway at Devonport. The Cornwall Railway applied for an Act of Parliament in 1845 but it was rejected, in part because of William Moorsom&#x27;s plan to carry trains across the water of the Hamoaze on the Devonport-to-Torpoint Ferry. Following this Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over as engineer and proposed to cross the water higher upstream using a bridge at Saltash instead. The Act enabling this scheme was passed on 3 August 1846.

==Design==
The structure was the third in a series of three large wrought iron bridges built in the middle of the 19th century. It was influenced by the preceding two, both of which had been designed by Robert Stephenson. The two central sections of Brunel&#x27;s bridge are novel adaptations of the design Stephenson employed for the High Level Bridge across the River Tyne in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1849. Brunel was present when Stephenson raised the girders of his Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait in the same year. From 1849 to 1853 Brunel was erecting an iron bridge of his own; the Chepstow Railway Bridge carried the South Wales Railway across the River Wye and featured a main truss of with a curving tubular main member and three conventional plate-girder approach spans of , a similar solution to that adopted for crossing the River Tamar at Saltash.

The river is about wide at Saltash. Brunel&#x27;s first thoughts had been to cross this on a double track timber viaduct with a central span of and six approach spans of with clearance above the water. This was rejected by the Admiralty, who had statutory responsibility for navigable waters, so Brunel produced a revised design to give clearance, with two spans of and two of . The Admiralty again rejected this plan, stipulating that there should not be more than one pier in the navigable part of the river.

Brunel now abandoned plans for a double track timber structure and instead proposed a single track wrought iron design consisting of a single span. As the cost of this structure would have been around £500,000 at 1846 prices (equivalent to £ in ), he amended the design to one of two main spans of with clearance above mean high spring tide; this was approved by the Admiralty and the directors of the Cornwall Railway.

The two spans are lenticular trusses with the top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, which tend to expand in length under load, while the bottom chord comprises a pair of chains, which tend to contract in length under load. By design, these two effects cancel so that there is no net change in length under load. This in turn enables each of the trusses to be supported with no horizontal thrust exerted on the piers, which is crucial in view of the curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also 17 shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , five of , , , , , and seven on the Devon side (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , and three of . This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of .

==History==
===1848-1859: Construction===

The first work was to properly survey the river bed. On 26 April 1848 a iron cylinder tall was launched into the Tamar. From the bottom of this the bed of the river could be examined to identify its nature and the location of solid foundations. The Cornwall Railway at this time was finding it difficult to raise funds and so most operations were suspended that summer, but a small fund was allowed for Brunel to continue the survey. The cylinder was positioned at 35 different places and a total of 175 borings made.

In 1853 the tenders for the bridge were considered by the Cornwall Railway Board, and it was decided to let the work to Charles John Mare, a shipbuilder from Blackwall who had built the ironwork for the Britannia Bridge. The fee he sought for building the Saltash Bridge was £162,000, but on 21 September 1855 while constructing the first of the two trusses he filed for bankruptcy. Brunel proposed that the company should complete this first truss itself by its own direct labour, to which the company agreed. A contract for the remainder of the building was awarded to Messrs Hudson and Male.
Mare&#x27;s first task had been to establish an erecting yard on the Devon shore with a jetty and workshops. He then proceeded to construct a iron cylinder tall which was to form the work base for the construction of the central pier. This was launched in May 1854 and moored in the centre of the river between four pontoons. The bottom had been shaped to follow the rock surveyed in 1848. Once it was settled on the river bed the water was pumped out, the mud within it excavated, and a solid masonry pier built up clear of the water. This was completed in November 1856.

The landward piers on the Cornish side of the river were completed in 1854 and the girders for these spans were hoisted up to their correct positions. Next to be built was the main truss for the Cornwall side of the river. The lower ties of the trusses formed of chains made from links. Many were obtained from the suspended works for Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge and others rolled new for Saltash. The Cornwall span was floated into position on 1 September 1857 and jacked up to full height in stages as the piers were built up beneath it, the central pier using cast iron octagonal columns; the landward one using ordinary masonry.
With the yard now cleared of the first truss, work could start on the main Devon span. This was similarly floated into position on 10 July 1858 and then raised in a similar manner. It was in its final position by 28 December 1858. After this had been removed, part of the yard had to be cleared to allow the construction of the final landward pier and then the Devon approach spans could be raised up to their final position. The work was sufficiently advanced that directors were able to make an inspection by train on 11 April 1859.

The Cornwall span had been tested before it was launched. The two ends were supported on substantial timber piers and the remaining scaffolding removed. Static loads of were placed on the deck, the deflections measured and any permanent change measured once the load was removed. Now that it was completed, the bridge had its statutory inspection and tests by Colonel Yolland on behalf of the Board of Trade on 20 April 1859. He ran a heavy train over the bridge and measured deflections in the main trusses of in the Devon truss, and in the Cornwall one. Overall he described it as &#x27;highly satisfactory&#x27;.
=== 1859: Opening day ===
Prince Albert had agreed to the bridge being named after him as early as 1853. He was invited to perform the opening ceremony, and on 2 May 1859 he travelled from Windsor on the Royal Train. Several thousand spectators attended that day, although guests from Cornwall were late for the ceremony as their train broke down at Liskeard. Illness prevented the attendance of Brunel who was instead represented by his chief assistant Robert Brereton. Public services commenced on 4 May 1859.

===1859-present===
After Brunel&#x27;s premature death on 15 September 1859 the directors of the Cornwall Railway Company decided to make the bridge a memorial to him by adding the words &quot;I.K. BRUNEL, ENGINEER, 1859&quot; in large metal letters on either end of the bridge. In 1921, new access platforms were added that obscured the lettering but in 2006 Network Rail relocated the platforms, allowing the name to be clearly seen again. The walkways had previously been temporarily removed in 1959 and the bridge floodlit during its centenary year.

Over the weekend of 21–22 May 1892 the track gauge on the bridge was converted from to during the final conversion of the whole Great Western Railway.

401 new cross-girders were fitted in 1905 to allow heavier locomotives to pass over. In 1908 the two spans nearest Saltash station were replaced with wider ones to accommodate a new track layout. The remaining approach spans were replaced on both sides of the river during 1928 and 1929. During the 1930s new cross-bracing and diagonal sway-bracing were added between the vertical standards to further strengthen the bridge and keep the suspension chains hanging in the correct shape.
The bridge was Grade 1 listed in 1952.

Additional links between the suspensions chains and the decking were added in 1969 to further strengthen the bridge. In 2011 Network Rail began a three-year £10 million refurbishment involving replacing 50,000 bolts and installation of 100 tonnes of new steelwork. The bridge has also been stripped back to the bare metal and repainted in the Goose Grey colour originally applied in 1952.

==Cultural impact==

The construction of such a large and distinctive bridge soon caught the attention of the general public. The launching of the Cornish span in 1857 attracted a crowd of around 20,000, with similar numbers said to have witnessed the launch of the Devonport span and the opening day. During its construction it was photographed many times and after its opening it was the subject for many paintings, including those by Devonport-born artist Alfred Wallis. It has also been the subject of many photographs and postcards.

It was already a feature in guidebooks in the year of its opening: &quot;It is a labour of Hercules, but Mr Brunel has accomplished the feat,&quot; proclaimed one, and went on to report in detail the design and construction of the bridge that &quot;for novelty and ingenuity of construction stands unrivalled in the world&quot;. More than 100 years later it continues to appear in many travel guides and features. John Betjeman summed up its impact on the traveller:
The general grey slate and back gardens of Plymouth, as seen from the Great Western made the surprise of Saltash Bridge all the more exciting. Up and down stream, grey battleships were moored in the Tamar and its reaches. Hundreds of feet below, the pathetic steam ferry to Saltash from the Devon bank tried to compete with Brunel&#x27;s mighty bridge.

The bridge has become a symbol of the transition from Devon to Cornwall. In the Great Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;The Cornish Riviera&quot; travel guide, SPB Mais regarded it as &quot;an almost magic means of transporting travellers from a county, which, if richer than others, is yet unmistakingly an English county, to a Duchy which is in every respect un-English. You shut your eyes going over the Saltash Bridge only to open them again on a foreign scene&quot;.

The bridge is the backdrop of ITV1&#x27;s &quot;The West Country Tonight&quot; during the old westcountry region.

===Special events===

Special occasions have been marked over the years by special events:

*1859 – The bridge was opened by Prince Albert two days before the railway was opened to the public. He arrived by special train from Windsor, was shown around the bridge and the works yard, and then left aboard the Royal Yacht.
*1959 – Floodlights lit up the bridge during 1959 in celebration of its centenary.
*2006 – The 200th anniversary of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s birth was celebrated by Network Rail permanently removing the access ways that covered his name above the portals.
*2009 – During the bank holiday weekend of 2–4 May there were many special events to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the opening of the bridge including a guided walk across the bridge and a re-enactment of the opening day.

<doc id="333951" wikidata="Q550255" url="?curid=333951" title="J. William Fulbright">
<text>James William Fulbright (April 9, 1905 – February 9, 1995) was an American politician, academic, and statesman who represented Arkansas in the United States Senate from 1945 until his resignation in 1974. , Fulbright is the longest-serving chairman in the history of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. A member of the Democratic Party, he is best known for his strong multilateralist positions on international issues, opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War, and the creation of the international fellowship program bearing his name, the Fulbright Program.

Fulbright was an admirer of Woodrow Wilson and an avowed anglophile. He was an early advocate for American entry into World War II and aid to Great Britain, first as a college professor and then as an elected member of the U.S. House of Representatives, where he authored the Fulbright Resolution expressing support for international peacekeeping initiatives and American entry into the United Nations.

After joining the Senate, Fulbright expressed support for Europeanism and the formation of a federal European union. He envisioned the Cold War as a struggle between nations – the United States and imperialist Russia – rather than ideologies. He therefore dismissed Asia as a peripheral theater of the conflict, focusing on containment of Soviet expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. He also stressed the possibility of nuclear annihilation, preferring political solutions over military solutions to Soviet aggression. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, his position moderated further to one of détente.

His political stances and powerful position as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made him one of the most visible critics of American involvement in the Vietnam War. Although he was persuaded by President Lyndon Johnson to sponsor the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, his relationship with the President soured after the 1965 U.S. bombing of Pleiku and Fulbright&#x27;s opposition to the war in Vietnam took root. Beginning in 1966, he chaired high-profile hearings investigating the conduct and progress of the war, which may have influenced the eventual American withdrawal.

On domestic issues, Fulbright was a Southern Democrat and signatory to the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright also opposed the anti-Communist crusades of Joseph McCarthy and the similar investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee.

== Early life, family and education ==
Fulbright was born on April 9, 1905, in Sumner, Missouri, the son of Jay and Roberta ( Waugh) Fulbright. In 1906, the Fulbright family moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas. His mother was a businesswoman, who consolidated her husband&#x27;s business enterprises and became an influential newspaper publisher, editor, and journalist.

Fulbright&#x27;s parents enrolled him in the University of Arkansas&#x27;s College of Education&#x27;s experimental grammar and secondary school.

===University of Arkansas===
Fulbright earned a history degree from the University of Arkansas in 1925, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was elected president of the student body and a star four-year player for the Arkansas Razorbacks football team from 1921 to 1924.

===Oxford University===
Fulbright later studied at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar at Pembroke College and graduated in 1928. Fulbright&#x27;s time at Oxford made him into a lifelong Anglophile, and he always had warm memories of Oxford.

At Oxford, he played on the rugby and lacrosse teams, and every summer, Fulbright decamped for France ostensibly to improve his French but really just to enjoy life in France.

Fulbright credited his time at Oxford with broadening his horizons. In particular, he credited his professor and friend R. B. McCallum&#x27;s &quot;one world&quot; philosophy of the world as an interlinked entity, where developments in one part would always have an impact on the other parts. McCallum was a great admirer of Woodrow Wilson, a supporter of the League of Nations, and a believer that multinational organizations were the best way to ensure global peace. Fulbright remained close to McCallum for the rest of his life and regularly exchanged letters with his mentor until McCallum&#x27;s death in 1973.

In 1930, Fulbright met his first wife, Philadelphia socialite Elizabeth Kremer Williams, at a dinner party during a business trip to Washington, D.C. He moved to Washington shortly thereafter to remain close to her. The couple married on June 15, 1932, and went on to have two daughters.

Fulbright received his law degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1934, was admitted to the bar in the District of Columbia, and became an attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

==Legal and academic career==

Fulbright was a lecturer in law at the University of Arkansas from 1936 to 1939. He was appointed president of the school in 1939, making him the youngest university president in the country. He held that post until 1941. The School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Arkansas is named in his honor, and he was elected there into Phi Beta Kappa. He was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute, University of Oxford. In September 1939, Fulbright, as president of the University of Arkansas, issued a public declaration declaring his sympathy with the Allied cause and urged the United States to maintain a pro-Allied neutrality. In the summer of 1940, Fulbright went a step further and declared it was in America&#x27;s &quot;vital interest&quot; to enter the war on the Allied side and warned that a victory by Nazi Germany would make the world a much darker place. The same year, Fulbright joined the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies.

In June 1941, Fulbright was suddenly fired from the University of Arkansas by the Governor, Homer Martin Adkins. He learned that the reason for his sacking was that Adkins had been offended that a Northwest Arkansas newspaper owned by his mother Roberta Fulbright had supported the governor&#x27;s opponent in the 1940 Democratic primary, and that was the governor&#x27;s revenge. Upset at the way that the governor&#x27;s caprice had ended his academic career, Fulbright became interested in politics.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Fulbright was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1942, where he served one term. During this period, he became a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. During World War II, there was much debate about the best way to win the peace after the Allies presumably won the war, with many urging the United States to reject isolationism. In September 1943 the House adopted the Fulbright Resolution, which supported international peacekeeping initiatives and encouraged the United States to participate in what became the United Nations in 1945. That brought Fulbright to national attention.

In 1943, a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the House and Senate foreign relations committees for the British Foreign Office identified Fulbright as &quot;a distinguished new-comer to the House.&quot; It continued:

==U.S. Senator (1945–1974)==
Fulbright&#x27;s career in the Senate was somewhat stunted, his tangible influence never matching his public luminescence. For all his seniority and powerful committee posts, he was not considered part of the Senate&#x27;s inner circle of friends and power brokers. He seemed to prefer it that way: the man who Harry S. Truman had called an &quot;overeducated SOB&quot; was, in the words of Clayton Fritchey, &quot;an individualist and a thinker,&quot; whose &quot;intellectualism alone alienates him from the Club&quot; of the Senate.

===1944 election===

In his first bid for the Senate, he won the 1944 Democratic primary by besting both incumbent Hattie Carraway, the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate, and Homer Adkins, the sitting governor who had fired him from the University of Arkansas. He easily won the general election against the Republican Victor Wade, a common result in the heavily Democratic South of the era. He went on to serve five six-year terms.

===Establishment of Fulbright program===
He promoted the passage of legislation in 1946 establishing the Fulbright Program of educational grants (Fulbright Fellowships and Fulbright Scholarships), sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State, governments in other countries, and the private sector. The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills. It is considered one of the most prestigious award programs and operates in 155 countries.

===Truman administration and Korean War===
In November 1946, immediately following the midterm elections in which Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress amidst President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s plummeting popularity in the polls, Fulbright suggested the President appoint Senator Arthur Vandenberg (R-MI) as his Secretary of State and resign, making Vandenberg president. Truman responded by saying he did not care what Senator &quot;Halfbright&quot; said.

In 1947, Fulbright supported the Truman Doctrine and voted for American aid to Greece. Subsequently, he voted for the Marshall Plan and to join NATO. Fulbright was very supportive of the plans for a federation in Western Europe. Fulbright supported the 1950 plan written by Jean Monnet and presented by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman for a European Coal and Steel Community, the earliest predecessor to the European Union.

In 1949, Fulbright became a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

After China&#x27;s entry into the Korean War in October 1950, Fulbright warned against American escalation. On January 18, 1951, he dismissed Korea as a peripheral interest not worth the risk of World War III and condemned plans to attack China as reckless and dangerous. In the same speech, he argued that the Soviet Union, not China, was the real enemy and that Korea was a distraction from Europe, which he considered to be far more important.

When President Truman fired General Douglas MacArthur for insubordination in April 1951, Fulbright came to Truman&#x27;s defense. When MacArthur appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the invitation of Republican senators, Fulbright embraced his role of Truman&#x27;s defender. When MacArthur argued communism was an inherent mortal danger to the United States, Fulbright countered, &quot;I had not myself thought of our enemy as being Communism; I thought of it as primarily being imperialist Russia.&quot;

===Eisenhower administration and conflict with Joe McCarthy===
Fulbright was an early opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, an ardent avowed anti-communist. Fulbright viewed McCarthy as an anti-intellectual, demagogue, and a major threat to American democracy and world peace. Fulbright was the only senator to vote against an appropriation for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1954, which was chaired by McCarthy.

After Republicans gained a Senate majority in the 1952 elections, McCarthy became chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. Fulbright was initially resistant to calls, like that of his friend William Benton of Connecticut, to openly oppose McCarthy. Though sympathetic toward Benton, who was among those Senators defeated in 1952 by anti-communist sentiment, Fulbright followed Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s lead in refraining from criticism. Fulbright was alarmed by McCarthy&#x27;s attack on the Voice of America (VOA) and the United States Information Agency, the latter agency then supervising educational exchange programs.

Fulbright broke from Johnson&#x27;s party line in summer 1953, following the State Department withdrawal of a fellowship for a student whose wife was suspected of communist affiliation and a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing which appeared to put the Fulbright Program at stake. In this hearing, McCarthy aggressively questioned Fulbright, whom he frequently referred to as &quot;Senator Halfbright&quot;, over the composition of the board clearing students for funding and on a policy that bars communists and their sympathizers from receiving appointments as lecturers and professors. Fulbright stated that he had no such influence over the board. After McCarthy insisted to be authorized to release statements of some Fulbright Program students both praising the communist form of government and condemning American values, Fulbright countered that he was willing to submit thousands of names of students who had praised the US and its way of government in their statements. The encounter was the last time McCarthy made a public assault on the program. The leading historian and original Fulbright Program board member Walter Johnson credited Fulbright with preventing the program from being ended by McCarthyism.

===1956 re-election campaign===

In 1956, Fulbright campaigned across the country for Adlai Stevenson II&#x27;s presidential campaign and across Arkansas for his own re-election bid. Fulbright emphasized his opposition to civil rights and his support for segregation. He also noted his support for oil companies and consistent votes for more farm aid to poultry farmers, a key Arkansas constituency. He easily defeated his Republican challenger.

===Kennedy administration===

Fulbright was John F. Kennedy&#x27;s first choice for Secretary of State in 1961 and had the support of Vice President Lyndon Johnson, but opponents to the choice within Kennedy&#x27;s circle, led by Harris Wofford, killed his chances. Dean Rusk was chosen instead.

In April 1961, Fulbright advised Kennedy not to go forward with the planned Bay of Pigs invasion. He said, &quot;The Castro regime is a thorn in the flesh. But it is not a dagger at the heart.&quot; In May 1961, Fulbright denounced the Kennedy administration&#x27;s system of having diplomats rotate from one position to another as an &quot;idiot policy.&quot;

Fulbright provoked international controversy on July 30, 1961, two weeks before the erection of the Berlin Wall, when he said in a television interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why the East Germans don&#x27;t just close their border, because I think they have the right to close it.&quot; His statement received a three-column spread on the front page of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; and condemnation in West Germany. The U.S. embassy in Bonn reported that &quot;rarely has a statement by a prominent American official aroused so much consternation, chagrin and anger.&quot; Chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s Press Secretary Egon Bahr was quoted, &quot;We privately called him Fulbricht.&quot; Historian William R. Smyser suggests that Fulbright&#x27;s comment may have been made at President Kennedy&#x27;s behest, as a signal to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev that the wall would be an acceptable means of defusing the Berlin Crisis. Kennedy did not distance himself from Fulbright&#x27;s comments, despite pressure.

In August 1961, as the Kennedy administration held firm in its commitment to a five-year foreign aid program, Fulbright and Pennsylvania U.S. Representative Thomas E. Morgan accompanied Democratic congressional leadership to their weekly White House breakfast session with Kennedy. In delivering opening statements on August 4, Fulbright spoke of the program introducing a new concept of foreign aid in the event of its passage.

Fulbright met with Kennedy during the latter&#x27;s visit to Fort Smith, Arkansas in October 1961.

After the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Fulbright modified his position on the Soviet Union from &quot;containment&quot; to détente. His position drew criticism from Senator Barry Goldwater, now the leader of anti-communists in the Senate. In response to Goldwater&#x27;s call for a &quot;total victory&quot; over communism, Fulbright argued that even &quot;total victory&quot; would mean hundreds of millions of deaths and an impossible, prolonged occupation of a ravaged Soviet Union and China.

====Chicken war====
Intensive chicken farming in the United States led to a 1961–64 &quot;chicken war&quot; with Europe. With inexpensive imported chicken available, chicken prices fell quickly and sharply across Europe, radically affecting European chicken consumption. U.S. chicken overtook nearly half of the imported European chicken market. Europe instituted tariffs on American chicken, to the detriment of Arkansan chicken farmers.
Senator Fulbright interrupted a NATO debate on nuclear armament to protest the tariffs, going so far as to threaten cutting US troops in NATO. The U.S. subsequently enacted a 25% tariff on imported light trucks, known as the chicken tax, which remains in effect as of 2010.

One of Fulbright&#x27;s local staffers in Arkansas was James McDougal. While he worked for Fulbright, McDougal met the future Arkansas Governor and US President Bill Clinton and the two of them, along with their wives, began investing in various development properties, including the parcel of land along the White River in the Ozarks that would later be the subject of an independent counsel investigation during Clinton&#x27;s first term in office.

===Johnson administration===
On March 25, 1964, Fulbright delivered an address calling on the U.S. to adapt itself to a world that was both changing and complex, the address being said by Fulbright to have been meant to explore self-evident truths in the national vocabulary of the U.S. regarding the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, Panama, and Latin America.

In May 1964, Fulbright predicted that time would see a cessation in the misunderstanding within the relationship between France and the United States and that French President Charles de Gaulle was deeply admired for his achievements despite confusion that might arise in others from his rhetoric.

In 1965, Fulbright objected to President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s position on the Dominican Civil War.

===Vietnam War===
====Gulf of Tonkin resolution====

On 4 August 1964, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara accused North Vietnam of attacking an American destroyer, the USS &quot;Maddox&quot; in international waters in what came to be known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident. The same day, President Johnson went on national television to denounce North Vietnam for &quot;aggression&quot; and to announce that he had ordered retaliatory air raids on North Vietnam. In the same speech, Johnson asked Congress to pass a resolution to prove to North Vietnam and its ally, China that the United States was united &quot;in support of freedom and in defense of peace in southeast Asia.&quot; On 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where Johnson asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed by the widest possible margin. Fulbright was one of the senators whom Johnson was most anxious and keen to have support the resolution. Fulbright was too much an individualist and intellectual to belong to the &quot;Club&quot; of the Senate, but he was widely respected as a thinker on foreign policy and was known to be a defender of Congress&#x27;s prerogatives. From Johnson&#x27;s viewpoint, having him support the resolution would bring many of the waverers around to voting for the resolution, as indeed proved to be the case.

Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the &quot;Maddox&quot; had taken place, and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whether the alleged attack had really taken place. Furthermore, Johnson insisted that the resolution, which was a &quot;functional equivalent to a declaration of war,&quot; was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam. In the 1964 presidential election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being &quot;soft on communism&quot; and by contrast promised a &quot;total victory&quot; over communism. Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election-year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really &quot;tough on communism&quot; and so dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack. Besides for the internal political reason that Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a foreign policy reason that argued that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam and so Congress passage of the resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely, rather than more likely. Fulbright&#x27;s longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the President, who cunningly exploited Fulbright&#x27;s vulnerability, his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy. Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies if he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship. Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State. Finally, for Fulbright in 1964, it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him, and Fulbright believed the resolution &quot;was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself,&quot; as Johnson had told him.

On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor that called for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of &quot;aggression&quot; and praised Johnson for his &quot;great restraint... in response to the provocation of a small power.&quot; He also declared his support for the Johnson administration&#x27;s &quot;noble&quot; Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking &quot;to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam.&quot; Fulbright concluded that the policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and, echoing Johnson&#x27;s argument, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam, which would presumably change its policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution. Several senators, such as Allen J. Ellender, Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern, and Gaylord Nelson, were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a blank check for a war in Southeast Asia, and in a meeting, Fulbright sought to assure them by saying that passing such a resolution would make fighting a war less likely and claimed that the whole purpose of the resolution was intimidation. Nelson wanted to insert an amendment to bar the president from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless he obtained the permission of Congress first and said that he did not like the open-ended nature of this resolution. Fulbright persuaded him not to do so by arguing the resolution was &quot;harmless&quot; and saying that the real purpose of the resolution was &quot;to pull the rug out from under Goldwater.&quot; He went on to ask Nelson whether he preferred Johnson or Goldwater to win the election. Fulbright dismissed Nelson&#x27;s fears of giving Johnson a blank check by saying that he had Johnson&#x27;s word that &quot;the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia.&quot;

On August 7, 1964, a unanimous House of Representatives and all but two members of the Senate voted to approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which led to a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam War. Fulbright, who sponsored the resolution, would later write:
Many Senators who accepted the Gulf of Tonkin resolution without question might well not have done so had they foreseen that it would subsequently be interpreted as a sweeping Congressional endorsement for the conduct of a large-scale war in Asia.

====Fulbright hearings and opposition to war====

By his own admission, Fulbright knew almost nothing about Vietnam until he met, in 1965, Bernard B. Fall, a French journalist who often wrote about Vietnam. Speaking to Fall radically changed Fulbright&#x27;s thinking about Vietnam, as Fall asserted that it simply not true that Ho Chi Minh was a Sino-Soviet &quot;puppet&quot; who wanted to overthrow the government of South Vietnam because his masters in Moscow and Beijing had presumably told him to do so. Fall&#x27;s influence served as the catalyst for the change in Fulbright&#x27;s thinking, as Fall introduced him to the writings of Philippe Devillers and Jean Lacouture. Fulbright made it his mission to learn as much as possible about Vietnam and indeed he had learned so much that at a meeting with the Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Fulbright was able to correct several mistakes made by the former about Vietnamese history, much to Rusk&#x27;s discomfort.

Although President Lyndon Johnson cajoled Fulbright into sponsoring the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in August 1964, his relationship with the President soured after the 1965 U.S. bombing of Pleiku in central Vietnam – which Fulbright consider a breach of Johnson&#x27;s commitment to not escalate the war. Fulbright&#x27;s opposition to the war in Vietnam took root, and beginning in 1966, he chaired public Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on the conduct of the war.

Fulbright invited President Johnson to appear before the Committee in January 1966 to explain why America was fighting in Vietnam, an offer that the President refused.

On 4 February 1966, Fulbright held the first hearings about the Vietnam War, where George F. Kennan and General James M. Gavin appeared as expert witnesses. The hearings had been prompted by Johnson&#x27;s request for additional $400 million to pay for the war, which gave Fulbright an excuse to hold them. Kennan testified that the Vietnam War was a grotesque distortion of the containment policy that he had outlined in 1946 and 1947. The World War II hero Gavin testified that it was his opinion as a soldier that the war could not be won as it being fought. On 4 February 1966, in an attempt to upstage the hearings Fulbright was holding in Washington, Johnson called an impromptu summit in Honolulu in the hope that the media would play more attention to the summit that he had called than to the hearings Fulbright was holding. Johnson&#x27;s two rebuttal witnesses at the hearings were General Maxwell Taylor and Secretary of State Dean Rusk.

As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Fulbright held a series of hearings on the Vietnam War from 1966 to 1971, many of which were televised to the nation in their entirety, a rarity until C-SPAN.

Fulbright&#x27;s reputation as a well-informed expert on foreign policy and his folksy Southern drawl, which made him sound &quot;authentic&quot; to ordinary Americans, made a formidable opponent for Johnson. During his exchanges with Taylor, Fulbright equated the firebombing of Japanese cities in World War II with the Operation Rolling Thunder bombings of North Vietnam and the use of napalm in South Vietnam, much to Taylor&#x27;s discomfort. Fulbright condemned the bombing of North Vietnam and asked Taylor to think of the &quot;millions of little children, sweet little children, innocent pure babies who love their mothers, and mothers who love their children, just like you love your son, thousands of little children, who never did us any harm, being slowly burned to death.&quot; A visibly uncomfortable Taylor stated that the United States was not targeting civilians in either Vietnam. Johnson called the hearings &quot;a very, very disastrous break.&quot;

As Fulbright had once been Johnson&#x27;s friend, his criticism of the war was seen as a personal betrayal and Johnson lashed out in especially vitriolic terms against him. Johnson took the view that at least Senator Wayne Morse had always been opposed to the Vietnam War, but Fulbright had promised him to support his Vietnam policy in 1964, causing him to see Fulbright as a &quot;Judas&quot; figure. Johnson liked to mock Fulbright as &quot;Senator Halfbright&quot; and sneered it was astonishing that someone as &quot;stupid&quot; as Fulbright had been awarded a degree at Oxford.

In April 1966, Fulbright delivered a speech at Johns Hopkins University, where Johnson had delivered a forthright defense of the war just a year earlier. Fulbright was sharply critical of the war. In his speech delivered in his usual folksy Southern drawl, Fulbright stated that the United States was &quot;in danger of losing its perspective on what exactly is within the realm of its power and what is beyond it.&quot; Warning of what he called &quot;the arrogance of power,&quot; Fulbright declared &quot;we are not living up to our capacity and promise as a civilized power for the world.&quot; He called the war a betrayal of American values. Johnson was furious with the speech, which he saw a personal attack from a man who had once been his friend and believed the remark about the &quot;arrogance of power&quot; to be about him. Johnson lashed out in a speech in which he called Fulbright and other critics of the war &quot;nervous Nellies,&quot; who knew the war in Vietnam could and would be won but were just too cowardly to fight on to the final victory.

In 1966, Fulbright published &quot;The Arrogance of Power&quot;, which attacked the justification of the Vietnam War, Congress&#x27;s failure to set limits on it, and the impulses that had given rise to it. Fulbright&#x27;s scathing critique undermined the elite consensus that the military intervention in Indochina was necessitated by Cold War geopolitics.

By 1967, the Senate was divided into three blocs. There was an antiwar &quot;dove&quot; bloc, led by Fulbright; a pro-war &quot;hawk&quot; bloc, led by the conservative Southern Democrat Senator John C. Stennis, and a third bloc consisting of waverers, who tended to shift their positions about war in tune with public opinion and moved variously closer to doves and hawks as they followed the public opinion polls. In contrast to his hostile attitudes towards Fulbright, Johnson was afraid of being labeled as soft on communism and so tended to try to appease Stennis and the hawks, who kept pressuring for more-and-more aggressive measures in Vietnam. In criticizing the war, Fulbright was careful to draw a distinction between condemning the war and condemning the ordinary soldiers fighting the war. After General William Westmoreland gave a speech in 1967 before a joint session of Congress, Fulbright stated, &quot;From the military standpoint, it was fine. The point is the policy that put our boys there.&quot; On 25 July 1967, Fulbright was invited with all of the other chairmen of the Senate committees to the White House to hear Johnson say that the war was being won. Fulbright told Johnson: &quot;Mr. President, what you really need to do is stop the war. That will solve all your problems. Vietnam is ruining our domestic and our foreign policy. I will not support it anymore.&quot; To prove that he was serious, Fulbright threatened to block a foreign aid bill before his committee and said that it was the only way to make Johnson pay attention to his concerns. Johnson accused Fulbright of wanting to ruin America&#x27;s reputation around the world. Using his favorite tactic of seeking to divide his opponents, Johnson told the other senators: &quot;I understand all of you feel you under the gun when you are down here, at least according to Bill Fulbright.&quot; Fulbright replied: &quot;Well, my position is that Vietnam is central to the whole problem. We need a new look. The effects of Vietnam are hurting the budget and foreign relations generally.&quot; Johnson exploded in fury: &quot;Bill, everybody doesn&#x27;t have a blind spot like you do. You say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t bomb North Vietnam&#x27;, on just about everything. I don&#x27;t have simple solution you have... I am not going to tell our men in the field to put their right hands behind their backs and fight only with their lefts. If you want me to get out of Vietnam, then you have the prerogative of taking the resolution which we are out there now. You can repeal it tomorrow. You can tell the troops to come home. You can tell General Westmoreland that he doesn&#x27;t know what is doing.&quot; As Johnson&#x27;s face was red, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield decided to calm matters down by changing the subject.

In early 1968, Fulbright was deeply depressed as he stated: &quot;The President, unfortunately, seems to have closed his mind to the consideration of any alternative, and his Rasputin–W.W. Rostow–seems able to isolate him from other views, and the Secretary [of State] happens to agree. I regret that I am unable to break this crust of immunity.&quot; However, after Robert McNamara was fired as Defense Secretary, Fulbright saw a &quot;ray of light&quot; as the man who replaced McNamara, Clark Clifford, was a longstanding &quot;close personal friend.&quot; Johnson had appointed Clifford Defense Secretary because he was a hawk, but Fulbright sought to change his mind about Vietnam. Fulbright invited Clifford to a secret meeting in which he introduced the newly appointed Defense Secretary to two World War II heroes, General James M. Gavin and General Matthew Ridgway. Both Gavin and Ridgway were emphatic that the United States could not win the war in Vietnam, and their opposition to the war helped to change Clifford&#x27;s mind. Despite his success with Clifford, Fulbright was close to despair as he wrote in a letter to Erich Fromm that this &quot;literally a miasma of madness in the city, enveloping everyone in the administration and most of those in Congress. I am at a loss of words to describe the idiocy of what we are doing.&quot;

Seeing that the Johnson administration was reeling in the wake of the Tet Offensive, Fulbright in February 1968 called for hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee into the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as Fulbright noted that there were several aspects of the claim that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked American destroyers in international waters that seemed dubious and questionable. McNamara was subpoenaed, and the televised hearings led to &quot;fireworks&quot; as Fulbright repeatedly asked difficult answers about De Soto raids on North Vietnam and Operation 34A. On 11 March 1968, Secretary of State Dean Rusk appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a tie decorated with doves carrying olive branches. Through Rusk was scheduled to testify about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the previous day in &quot;The New York Times&quot; had appeared a leaked story that Westmoreland had requested for Johnson to send 206,000 more troops to Vietnam. During Rusk&#x27;s two days of testimony, the main issue turned out to be the troop request with Fulbright insisting for Johnson to seek congressional approval first. In response to Fulbright&#x27;s questions, Rusk stated that if more troops were sent to Vietnam, the president would consult &quot;appropriate members of Congress.&quot; Most notably, several senators who had voted with Stennis and the other hawks now aligned themselves with Fulbright, which indicated that Congress was turning against the war.

In late October 1968, after Johnson announced a halt in bombing in North Vietnam in accordance with peace talks, Fulbright stated that his hopefulness that the announcement would lead to a general ceasefire.

===Nixon administration===
In March 1969, Secretary of State William P. Rogers testified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the Nixon administration&#x27;s foreign policy, Fulbright telling Rogers that the appearance was both useful and promising. In April 1969, Fublright received a letter from a former soldier who served in Vietnam, Ron Ridenhour, containing the results of Ridenhour&#x27;s investigation into the My Lai massacre, said that he had heard so many stories from other soldiers about a massacre that had happened in March 1968 at a village that the soldiers knew only as &quot;Pinkville.&quot; In May 1969, Fulbright delivered a speech at National War College that advocated for a U.S. withdraw from Vietnam in spite of possibly having to settle for something less than a standoff against the communists. He spoke for overhauling foreign policy to concentrate it less on the power of the executive branch. On 15 October 1969, Fulbright spoke at one of the rallies held by the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. As all of the rallies held on 15 October were peaceful, Fulbright taunted a reporter who was hoping there would be violence: &quot;I am sorry that you thought the demonstrations of 15 October were &#x27;subversive and hysterical&#x27;. They seemed to me to be extremely well-behaved and a very serious demonstration of disapproval of the tragic mistake... in Vietnam.&quot; In response to the Moratorium protests, President Nixon went on national television on 3 November 1969 to give his speech asking for the support of the &quot;silent majority&quot; towards his Vietnam policy. On 4 November, Fulbright told a journalist that Nixon had &quot;fully and truthfully taken upon himself Johnson&#x27;s war.&quot; Fulbright called for the second round of the Moratorium protests scheduled for 15 November to be canceled for fear that Nixon was planning to start a riot to discredit the antiwar movement. The protests in the 15th went ahead and were peaceful, but the success of Nixon&#x27;s &quot;silent majority speech&quot; left Fulbright depressed as he wrote at the time that &quot;it is very distressing, indeed, to think that we eliminated LBJ only to end up with this, which is almost more than the human spirit can endure.&quot; However, on 12 November 1969 appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; an article by Seymour Hersh revealing the My Lai Massacre on 16 March 1968. Fulbright was deeply shocked when he learned about what happened at May Lai: &quot;it is a matter of the greatest importance and emphasizes in the most dramatic manner the brutalization of our society.&quot;

In 1970, Daniel Ellsberg offered Fulbright his copy of the Pentagon Papers to ask him to insert them into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, which would allow the media to cite them without fear of prosecution for publishing secret documents. Fulbright declined and instead sent a letter to Defense Secretary Melvin Laird asking him to declassify the Pentagon Papers. In 1971, Fulbright held another set of hearing about the Vietnam. The Fulbright Hearings included the notable testimony of Vietnam veteran and future Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry.

In February 1970, South Dakota Senator George McGovern accused the former Viet Cong detainee James N. Rowe of being dispatched by the Pentagon to criticize him, Fulbright, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who had indicated their opposition to continued American involvement in Vietnam. On March 11, Fulbright introduced a resolution regarding the commitment of American troops or air forces for combat in Laos by Nixon, who, under the guidelines of the resolution, would not be able to combat forces in or over Laos without congressional affirmative action. In his address introducing the resolution, Fulbright said, &quot;The Senate must not remain silent now while the President uses the armed forces of the United States to, fight an undeclared and undisclosed war in Laos.&quot; The following month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to repeal the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Fulbright admitted the repeal would now have little to no legal impact and described the action as one intended to be part of an ongoing process of clearing out legislation that was now out of date. On August 22, Fulbright stated his support for a bilateral treaty to grant the United States authority to use military force to guarantee both &quot;territory and independence of Israel within the borders of 1967&quot; and that the proposed measure would obligate Israel not to violate those frontiers, which had been created prior to the Six-Day War. In October, Defense Department officials disclosed publication of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee showing the United States entered a 1960 agreement supporting a 40,000-man Ethiopian army in addition to beginning Ethiopia&#x27;s opposition to threats against its territorial integrity. Fulbright responded to the disclosure by saying the wording seemed to go &quot;much further than saying a good word in the United Nations&quot; and suggested the U.S. had agreed to aid the Ethiopian Emperor if the possibility of facing an internal insurrection arose.

On February 28, 1971, Fulbright announced his intent to submit a bill compelling the Secretary of State and other Nixon administration officials to appear before Congress to explain their position on Vietnam. Fulbright said that the measure would be warranted by the refusal of William P. Rogers, Henry A. Kissinger, and other officials to appear before Congress. He reasoned that they would not appear because &quot;they know there are a number of people who don&#x27;t agree with them, and it makes it embarrassing and they don&#x27;t like it; they especially don&#x27;t like to have it in front of television.&quot; On October 31, Fulbright pledged his support to less-controversial aspects of foreign aid such as refugee relief and military aid to Israel and predicted the Nixon administration would be met with defeat or contention in the event of proposed aid for Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Greece. Fulbright said a meeting between the Foreign Relations Committee the following day would see &quot;that some kind of interim program will probably be devised&quot; and expressed his disdain for &quot;the continuing resolution approach.&quot;

In March 1972, Fulbright sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst to request to the Justice Department not to use the Information Agency documentary &quot;Czechoslovakia 1968&quot; for use in New York. He stated that it appeared to violate the 1948 law that created the agency, which he stated &quot;was created for the purpose of the dissemination abroad of information about the United States, its people, and policies.&quot; In April, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced the end of an inquiry into a drinking incident involving United States Ambassador to France Arthur K. Watson. Fulbright said that he did not expect the committee to pursue the matter and published a letter on the subject from Rogers. On August 3, the Senate approved the treaty limiting defense missiles for the United States and the Soviet Union. The following day, Fulbright held a closed meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to form a strategy against the Nixon administration&#x27;s attempts to attach additional reservations to the intercontinental missile agreement signed by Nixon the previous May.

On July 11, 1973, during a speech at an American Bankers Association meeting, Fulbright criticized Capitol Hill attempts to block trade concessions to the Soviet Union until it allowed the emigration of Jews and other groups: &quot;Learning to live together in peace is the most important issue for the Soviet Union and the United States, too important to be compromised by meddling – even idealistic meddling – in each other&#x27;s affairs.&quot; In August, Nixon announced his choice of Kissinger to replace the retiring Rogers as Secretary of State. Ahead of the hearings, Kissinger was expected to have the advantage of cultivating relationships with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vermont Senator George Aiken noting that Kissinger &quot;met with us at Senator Fulbright&#x27;s house for breakfast at least twice a year.&quot;

In November 1973, Fulbright endorsed the Middle East policy of Secretary of State Kissinger in a Senate speech, arguing for the central requirement of a peace requirement prior to &quot;another military truce hardens into another untenable and illusory status quo&quot; and added that both sides would need to make concessions. Fulbright stated that Washington, Moscow, and the United Nations were responsible for spearheading the peace settlement.

He also led the charge against confirming Nixon&#x27;s conservative Supreme Court nominees Clement Haynsworth and Harold Carswell.

In May 1974, Fulbright disclosed the existence of a weapon stockpile for South Korea, South Vietnam, and Thailand, and the Defense Department released a statement three days later that confirmed Fulbright&#x27;s admission. Throughout 1974, Kissinger was investigated for his possible role in initiating wiretaps of 13 government officials and four newsmen from 1969 to 1971. In July, Fulbright stated that nothing significant had emerged from the Kissinger testimony during his nomination for Secretary of State the previous fall, and Fulbright indicated his belief that opponents of détente with the Soviet Union were hoping to unseat Kissinger from the investigation into his role in the wiretapping.

===Defeat and resignation===
In 1974, Fulbright was defeated in the Democratic primary in Arkansas by then-Governor Dale Bumpers. His well-documented stances on Vietnam, the Middle East, and Watergate were out of step with the Arkansan majority, and his campaign powers had atrophied. Bumpers won by a landslide. Speaking to US representatives in the weeks after Fulbright&#x27;s primary loss, Nixon mocked the defeat.

At the time that he formally resigned the Senate in December 1974, Fulbright had spent his entire 29 years in the Senate as the junior senator from Arkansas, behind John L. McClellan who entered the Senate two years before him. Only Tom Harkin, who served as junior Senator from Iowa from 1985 to 2015 (to senior Senator Chuck Grassley), was a junior Senator for longer.

==Political and foreign policy views==
===American foreign policy===
In &quot;The Arrogance of Power&quot;, Fulbright offered his analysis of American foreign policy:
Throughout our history two strands have coexisted uneasily; a dominant strand of democratic humanism and a lesser but durable strand of intolerant Puritanism. There has been a tendency through the years for reason and moderation to prevail as long as things are going tolerably well or as long as our problems seem clear and finite and manageable. But... when some event or leader of opinion has aroused the people to a state of high emotion, our puritan spirit has tended to break through, leading us to look at the world through the distorting prism of a harsh and angry moralism.

Fulbright also related his opposition to any American tendencies to intervene in the affairs of other nations:
Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God&#x27;s favor, conferring upon it a special responsibility for other nations – to make them richer and happier and wiser, to remake them, that is, in its own shining image. Power confuses itself with virtue and tends also to take itself for omnipotence. Once imbued with the idea of a mission, a great nation easily assumes that it has the means as well as the duty to do God&#x27;s work.

He was also a strong believer in international law:
Law is the essential foundation of stability and order both within societies and in international relations. As a conservative power, the United States has a vital interest in upholding and expanding the reign of law in international relations. Insofar as international law is observed, it provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations. When we violate the law ourselves, whatever short-term advantage may be gained, we are obviously encouraging others to violate the law; we thus encourage disorder and instability and thereby do incalculable damage to our own long-term interests.

===Cold War and communism===
Like his friend Adlai Stevenson II, Fulbright was regarded as a &quot;Cold War liberal.&quot;

Fulbright viewed the Cold War as a struggle between the United States and a new imperialist Russia. To that end, he advocated vigorous aid and armament for Europe as opposed to a global anti-communist policy, which would include opposition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In March 1966, Fulbright held hearings on US policy towards the PRC. Almost uniformly, the academics who testified favored ending the US&#x27;s isolation of the PRC.

Fulbright additionally believed that conflict with the Soviet Union would almost certainly lead to nuclear war and potentially global annihilation. He initially favored the policy of containment of the Soviet Union, instead of the more aggressive rollback policy. Fulbright saw the Cold War as more of a political struggle than a military struggle and criticized excessive military spending as a means of victory. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, he further modified his position toward the Soviets to détente.

===Segregation and civil rights===
In 1950, Fulbright cosponsored an amendment, which, if enacted, would allow soldiers to choose whether or not to serve in a racially integrated unit. In 1952, Fulbright assisted with blocking an Alaska statehood bill entirely because of his view that legislators from the state would support civil rights bills.

According to biographer Randall Bennett Woods, Fulbright believed the South was not yet ready for integration but that education would eventually eradicate prejudice and allow blacks to &quot;take their rightful place in American society.&quot; In 1954, Fulbright signed Strom Thurmond&#x27;s Southern Manifesto in opposition to the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. In a letter to a constituent at the time, he compared the Manifesto favorably to the alternative of secession. Privately, he assured aides that signing the Manifesto was his only means of maintaining influence with the Southern delegation. He, along with John Sparkman, Lister Hill, and Price Daniel, submitted a version that acknowledged theirs was a minority position and pledged to fight the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling through legal means. In later years, he insisted his intervention had led to a more moderate version of the Manifesto than Thurmond originally proposed, and his claims were generally accepted by Arkansan black leadership.

Fulbright was one of only two Southern members of Congress to condemn the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 by white supremacists that killed four girls and injured between 14 and 22 other people.

With other southern Democrats, Fulbright participated in the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and opposed the 1965 Voting Rights Act. However, in 1970, Fulbright voted for a five-year extension of the Voting Rights Act.

===Israel and Zionism===
In 1963, Fulbright claimed that $5 million tax-deductible from philanthropic Americans was sent to Israel and then recycled back to the U.S. for distribution to organizations seeking to influence public opinion in favor of Israel.

On April 15, 1973, Fulbright said on &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, &quot;Israel controls the U.S. Senate. The Senate is subservient to Israel, in my opinion much too much. We should be more concerned about the United States interest rather than doing the bidding of Israel. This is a most unusual development.&quot; According to John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, AIPAC played an important role in Fulbright&#x27;s failure to be re-elected in 1974.

==Retirement and death==

After his retirement, Fulbright practiced international law at the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson from 1975 to 1993. Elizabeth, an effective campaigner and popular figure on the Capitol Hill social scene during her husband&#x27;s long political career, died on October 5, 1985, after a long illness. On March 10, 1990, Fulbright married Harriet Mayor, a longtime assistant and former executive director of the Fulbright Association, in a ceremony at his home in Washington&#x27;s Kalorama neighborhood.

On May 5, 1993, President Bill Clinton presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Fulbright at his eighty-eighth birthday celebration from the Fulbright Association.

Fulbright died of a stroke at his Washington, D.C. home on February 9, 1995. He was 89 years old. A year later, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary dinner of the Fulbright Program held June 5, 1996 at the White House, President Bill Clinton said, &quot;Hillary and I have looked forward for some time to celebrating this 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Program, to honor the dream and legacy of a great American, a citizen of the world, a native of my home state and my mentor and friend, Senator Fulbright.&quot;

Fulbright&#x27;s ashes were interred at the Fulbright family plot in Evergreen Cemetery in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

==Legacy==
In 1996, The George Washington University renamed a residence hall in his honor. The J. William Fulbright Hall is located 2223 H Street, N.W., at the corner of 23rd and H Streets. It received historic designations as a District of Columbia historic site on January 28, 2010, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 2010.
On October 21, 2002, in a speech at the dedication of the Fulbright Sculpture at the University of Arkansas, fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton said,

I admired him. I liked him. On the occasions when we disagreed, I loved arguing with him. I never loved getting in an argument with anybody as much in my entire life as I loved fighting with Bill Fulbright. I&#x27;m quite sure I always lost, and yet he managed to make me think I might have won.

During the removal of monuments during the George Floyd protests, Fulbright&#x27;s legacy was examined by the University of Arkansas community with respect to an on-campus statue and the name of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. Fulbright was a 1925 alumnus, professor, and university president from 1939 to 1941. A spirited debate discussed his reputation as a racist who defended segregation and signed the Southern Manifesto. Defenders noted his record on international affairs and education, especially the Fulbright Program. One Fulbright biographer who knew Fulbright claimed he was not a racist, but supported segregationist policies expected of a Southern senator at the time, while another biographer summarized Fulbright&#x27;s legacy as &quot;a political giant in Arkansas, in both good and awful ways&quot;. A university panel voted to remove the statue and rename the college, but the University of Arkansas System Board of Trustees (which Fulbright once chaired as UA president) voted to keep both due to a state law requiring Arkansas General Assembly approval to remove monuments.

Approximately 294,000 &quot;Fulbrighters&quot;, 111,000 from the United States and 183,000 from other countries, have participated in the Program since its inception over sixty years ago. The Fulbright Program awards approximately 6,000 new grants annually.

<text>General Records was a small American record label during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Its most notable releases are piano solos recorded by Jelly Roll Morton in December 1939 late in his career.

==History==

Established around 1939, General Records was a division of Consolidated Records, Inc., of New York City. The label was owned by pioneering sound engineer Hazard E. Reeves, of Reeves Sound Studios (1939–1944) in Manhattan.

The audio fidelity is above average for the era, and most General discs were pressed in good quality shellac, although the quality declined as good shellac became scarce with the start of World War II.

The most famous General Records are a series of recordings by Jelly Roll Morton. The recording sessions in December 1939 and January 1940 were the last in Morton&#x27;s career.

In 1946 Milt Gabler of Commodore Records purchased the stock, masters and rights of General Records when the company went out of production. Morton&#x27;s solo piano album, &quot;New Orleans Memories&quot;, and his &quot;Tavern Tunes&quot; series (recorded with the Morton Sextet and the Morton Seven) were included in the purchase. The out-of-print recordings were re-released on the Commodore label.

&quot;Recorded late in his career, the General records caught Jelly Roll at perhaps the peak of his ability, and many of these records, particularly &quot;Mamie&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Leave Me Here&quot;, are regarded as blues classics,&quot; &quot; wrote &quot;The Jazz Record&quot; in August 1946. &quot;Half the series are straight old ragtime piano, which ties in nicely with the present day revival of interest in old piano rags.&quot;

<doc id="333957" wikidata="Q3940379" url="?curid=333957" title="Curtiss Falcon">
<text>The Curtiss Falcon was a family of military biplane aircraft built by the American aircraft manufacturer Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company during the 1920s. Most saw service as part of the United States Army Air Corps as observation aircraft with the designations O-1 and O-11, or as the attack aircraft designated the A-3 Falcon.

U.S. Navy variants were used initially as fighter-bombers with the designation F8C Falcon, then as the first U.S. Marine Corps dive bombers with the name Helldiver. Two later generations of Curtiss dive-bombers were also named Helldiver.

The type was introduced in 1925 and saw first-line service in the United States until 1934. Curtiss Falcons fought in the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 in Brazil, used by the forces of São Paulo.

==Design and development==
The Falcon XO-1 prototype was evaluated by the USAAC along with eleven other prototypes in 1924 and the Douglas XO-2 was declared the winner of that competition. So Curtiss re-engined the prototype with the Packard 1A-1500 for the 1925 trials, which it won. The engine failed to live up to expectations and the O-1 ordered by the Army was fitted with the 435 hp (324 kW) Curtiss V-1150 (D-12) engine.

The aircraft was a conventional unequal-span biplane design with wooden wings, while the fuselage was built using aluminum tubing with steel tie rod bracing. The landing gear was fixed and the tail included a balanced rudder with a rear skid originally, later changed to a tailwheel.

The initial A-3 Falcon order was placed in the winter of 1927 and delivery of the first plane was in October 1927. A total of 76 A-3s were received. Later, six aircraft were modified as pilot trainers with dual controls and redesignated A-3A. A second batch of 78 improved A-3Bs, based on the Curtiss O-1E, was purchased beginning in 1929.

==Operational history==
Reasonably successful as an observation aircraft, Falcons flew primarily in the 1st, 5th and 99th Observation Squadrons of the 9th Observation Group, Mitchel Field, New York. The A-3 Attack Falcon saw considerable use, in first-line service with the 8th, 13th and 19th Attack Squadrons of the 3rd Attack Group, Barksdale Field, Louisiana, and the 26th Attack Squadron in Hawaii from 1928 to 1934 and second-line service with reserve units until 1937.

The U.S. Navy introduced the F8C-1 and F8C-3 Falcon as a shipboard fighter in 1927–1928. They were later redesignated OC-1 and OC-2 for Marine Corps use as an observation/bomber. The F8C-4 Helldiver variant initially saw service with the Navy, and the first production batch of 25 was transferred in 1931 to the Marine Corps. A total of 34 F8Cs redesignated as O2C-1 observation aircraft were also transferred to the Naval Reserve in 1931, serving with squadrons VN-10RD9, VN-11RD9, and VN-12RD9. Most of the 63 newer F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldivers also served with the Marines, remaining in service until 1936. The type was featured in multiple Hollywood films: &quot;Flight&quot; (1929), &quot;Hell Divers&quot; (1932) and &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). Two non-flying replicas were built for &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005)

Curtiss Falcon aircraft fought during the Brazil Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, under the flag of São Paulo. In Bolivia, the aircraft type also fought in the Chaco War (1932–1935), bombing Paraguayan troops. The Colombian Air Force used Falcon F-8 and O-1 in the Colombia-Peru War in 1932–3.

<text>Imperial Records is an American record company and label started in 1947 by Lew Chudd. The label was reactivated in 2006 by EMI, which owned the label and back catalogue at the time. Imperial is owned by Universal Music Group.

==Early years to 1979==
When Imperial was founded in 1947, it concentrated on rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and country music: Fats Domino, Frankie Ford, Ricky Nelson, and Slim Whitman. In the UK, Imperial was distributed by London Records.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Imperial released jazz albums by Sonny Criss, Charlie Mariano, Papa Celestin, Erskine Hawkins, and Harold Land.

Imperial bought Aladdin in 1961 and Minit Records in 1963, having distributed Minit since 1960. During the 1950s, Imperial was one of the primary labels issuing a vast quantity of R&amp;B from New Orleans through their involvement with producer and writer Dave Bartholomew and in the 1960s with their distribution (and purchase, a few years later) of Minit.

In 1963, after Imperial lost Fats Domino and Ricky Nelson to rival record companies ABC Records and Decca Records, respectively, Chudd sold the label to Liberty Records.

Under Liberty&#x27;s management, the label enjoyed success with Irma Thomas, Johnny Rivers, Jackie DeShannon, Classics IV, and Cher. During the British Invasion, Liberty (whose recordings were distributed by EMI in the UK) licensed the Hollies, Billy J. Kramer, the Dakotas, and the Swinging Blue Jeans from EMI. Recordings by the Bonzo Dog Band and Kim Fowley were issued in the U.S. by Imperial.

By 1970, the label had become part of Liberty&#x27;s merger with United Artists Records but was phased out shortly after, with its roster transferred to United Artists. EMI acquired the Imperial Records catalogue with its acquisition of UA Records in 1979.

==1990s to present==
Throughout the 1990s, EMI released CD compilations of Imperial artists that featured the original Imperial labels.

In June 2006, EMI re-activated the Imperial Records imprint and announced that it would be the urban music division of Caroline Distribution, part of Virgin Records, spearheaded by the urban music veteran Neil Levine. The first signing to the imprint was Raptivism Records. Fat Joe signed with Virgin Records and Imperial Records. Imperial provided resources for developing urban artists with EMI&#x27;s major labels, including Capitol Records and Virgin Records, which were merged into the Capitol Music Group in January 2007. Universal Music Group acquired the Capitol Music Group as part of its acquisition of the majority of EMI&#x27;s recorded music operations in 2012. After a few releases, Imperial became dormant again.

In 2021, the Republic Records unit of Universal Music Group revived the Imperial name with the formation of Imperial Music.

<text>An administrative county was a first-level administrative division in England and Wales from 1888 to 1974, and in Ireland from 1899 until 1973 in Northern Ireland, 2002 in the Republic of Ireland. They are now abolished, although most Northern Ireland lieutenancy areas and Republic of Ireland counties have the same boundaries as former administrative countries.

==History==
===England and Wales===

The term was introduced for England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1888, which created county councils for various areas, and called them &quot;administrative counties&quot; to distinguish them from the continuing &quot;statutory counties&quot;.

In England and Wales the legislation was repealed in 1974, and entities called &#x27;metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties&#x27; in England and &#x27;counties&#x27; in Wales were introduced in their place. Though strictly inaccurate, these are often called &#x27;administrative counties&#x27; to distinguish them from both the historic counties, and the ceremonial counties.

===Scotland===
For local government purposes Scottish counties were replaced in 1975 with a system of regions and island council areas.

===Ireland===
The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created administrative counties in Ireland on the same model that had been used in England and Wales.

In Northern Ireland the administrative counties were replaced by a system of 26 districts on 1 October 1973. Section 131 of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 stated that &quot;every county and every county borough shall cease to be an administrative area for local government purposes&quot;. The areas of the former administrative counties (and county boroughs) remain in use for Lieutenancy purposes, being defined as the areas used &quot;for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973, subject to any subsequent definition of their boundaries …&quot;.

In the Republic of Ireland the legislation that created them remained in force until 1 January 2002, when they were renamed as &quot;counties&quot; under the Local Government Act 2001. The term &quot;administrative county&quot; is retained by the Placenames Database of Ireland to distinguish the modern counties in Dublin of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin from the traditional counties, which include County Dublin.

==New entities==
The administrative counties that did not share the names of previous counties:

England
Scotland
*Ross-shire and Cromartyshire (Ross and Cromarty)

Republic of Ireland
*Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin (County Dublin). Created in 1994.

<doc id="333964" wikidata="Q1416825" url="?curid=333964" title="Forestay">
<text>On a sailing vessel, a forestay, sometimes just called a stay, is a piece of standing rigging which keeps a mast from falling backwards. It is attached either at the very top of the mast, or in fractional rigs between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast. The other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat.

Often a sail is attached to the forestay. This sail may be a jib or a genoa. In a cutter rig, the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the forestay, perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit. The sail on the forestay is then referred to as the staysail or stays&#x27;l.

A forestay might be made from stainless steel wire on a modern yacht, solid stainless steel rod, carbon rod, or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (such as Spectra or Dyneema) on a high-performance racing boat, and galvanised wire or natural fibers on an older cutter or square-rigged ship.

<doc id="333965" wikidata="Q1142294" url="?curid=333965" title="Cryptomonas">
<text>Cryptomonas is the name-giving genus of the Cryptomonads established by German biologist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1831. The algae are common in freshwater habitats and brackish water worldwide and often form blooms in greater depths of lakes. The cells are usually brownish or greenish in color and are characteristic of having a slit-like furrow at the anterior. They are not known to produce any toxins. They are used to feed small zooplankton, which is the food source for small fish in fish farms. Many species of &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; can only be identified by DNA sequencing. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; can be found in several marine ecosystems in Australia and South Korea.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Cryptomonas&quot; has the meaning of hidden small flagellates from “crypto” and “monas”.

== Genome structure ==
Species within &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; contain four genomes: the nuclear, the nucleomorph, the plastid, and mitochondrial genomes. The plastid genome contains 118 kilobase pairs and is a result of one endosymbiosis event of ancient red alga. The study of genome structures of the genus has contributed to the life-history dependent dimorphism of &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;, which is discussed in details later in the section Dimorphism.

== Functions ==
&quot;Cryptomonas&quot; are also photolithotrophs that contribute to oxygenic carbon fixation making them greatly critical to the carbon levels of fresh water environments.

== Reproduction ==
Replication of &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; occurs in early summer when fresh water species are also reproducing. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; replicates via mitosis that only takes about ten minutes. Sexual reproduction is not observed in this genus as many other genera of Cryptophytes also do not reproduce sexually.

== Cell structure ==

Organisms are asymmetric with a transparent membrane on the outside. The membrane is not ciliated. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; cells are fairly large; they average about 40 micrometers in size and often take the shape of an oval or ovoid. There are two flagella present, yet the two flagella are not equally sized. One is shorter and curled and the other one is longer and straight. The two flagella are fixed to the cell by four unique microtubular roots. In addition, the flagella are lined with small hairs that allow for better movement. There are also contractile vacuoles that control the flow of water in and out.

Two boat-shaped plastids are observed in the cells. In a secondary endosymbiosis event, the phagotrophic ancestor of the &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; presumably captured a red alga and reduced it to a complex plastid with four envelope membranes. The phycobilisomes of the former red algae were reduced until only phycoerythrin remained. Phycoerythrobilin, a type of red phycobilin pigment, is a chromophore discovered in cyanobacteria, chloroplasts of red algae and some Cryptomonads. Phycoerythrobilin is present in the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin, the terminal acceptor of energy during the process of photosynthesis. The phycoerythrin was translocated into the thylakoid lumen with its chromophore composition altered; subsequently, phycobiliproteins with at least seven different absorption spectra evolved. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; is distinguished by the purple phycoerythrin 566 as an accessory pigment, which gives the organisms a brownish color in appearance.

== Behaviour ==
&quot;Cryptomonas&quot; are large in size, grow rather slowly, and are limited in nutrients. It also migrates between depths of water in order to reach depths that are ideal for photosynthesis and bacteriograzing, as well avoiding organisms that are their predators. Typically, they are found at depths of up to 102 meters and in a temperature range of -1.4 to 1.5 degrees Celsius. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; seem to grow and survive with little competition. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; swim actively, and they rotate while moving and sometimes swim in helical motion.

== Dimorphism ==
Life history-dependent dimorphism was first described in organisms in 1986. In &quot;Proteomonas&quot;, another genus of Cryptophyceae, the two morphs revealed large differences in cell size which apparently led to its discovery and subsequent recognition. &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; has been discovered to be another genus that possesses the characteristic of dimorphism.

Traditionally, &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; was considered to be 3 separate genera: &quot;Chilomonas,&quot; &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; and &quot;Campylomonas&quot;. Before further molecular analysis, &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; have been characterized by mainly morphological characters, such as cell size, cell shape, number and color of plastids. However, it was still difficult to define &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; due to insufficient understanding of morphological characters and less-than adequate visibility of living cells using light microscopy alone to observe the cell structures. Also, laboratories had lacked the condition to detect the different stages of particular organisms.

The furrow-gullet system was used as a standard for organization of genera for many years. Most other Cryptophyte genera have either furrow or gullet, but &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; is one of the genera that possess a combination of the two, creating a furrow-gullet complex. The furrow-gullet complex is used by the cells to digest food for smaller organisms. Also, ejectisomes are found to be surrounding the complex. Previously, different textures of furrow plates are used to classify genera. For example, a furrow plate (extending posteriorly along one side of the ventral furrow-gullet complex) has been described as “scalariform” in &quot;Campylomonas&quot; yet “fibrous” in &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;. In addition, in &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;, the inner periplast component consists of polygonal plates. In contrast, in &quot;Campylomonas&quot;, the inner periplast component is a continuous sheet-like layer.

However, during later research, more evidence of both molecular phylogeny and morphology has been found to support the claim that the three genera should be considered one single dimorphic genus. Characters previously used to distinguish &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; from &quot;Campylomonas&quot; were found to occur together in dimorphic strains, such as the type of periplast (polygonal periplast plates versus a continuous periplast sheet), indicating that periplast types relate to different life-history stages of a single taxon. To evaluate the taxonomic significance of the type of periplast and other characters previously used to distinguish genera and species, molecular phylogenetic analyses have been used to study two nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (ITS2, partial LSU rDNA) and a nucleomorph ribosomal gene (SSU rDNA). The results of the phylogenetic study provide molecular evidence for a life history-dependent dimorphism in the genus &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;: the genus &quot;Campylomonas&quot; represents the alternate morph of &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;. &quot;Campylomonas&quot; and &quot;Chilomonas&quot; are reduced to synonyms of &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;.

== Further research ==
In addition to plastids containing phycoerythrobilin, campylomorphs, formerly genera &quot;Campylomonas&quot; and &quot;Chilomonas&quot;, also contain a colorless plastid that lacks photosynthetic pigment: leucoplast.

Since the complete loss of photopigments clearly distinguishes the leukoplastidious cryptophytes from &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;, the incorporation of “&quot;Chilomonas&quot;” with &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; has been highly debatable. Scientists have not yet found out an explanation of how leucoplasts disappear during later life stage and when they disappear.

<doc id="333968" wikidata="Q340982" url="?curid=333968" title="Backstay">
<text>A backstay is a piece of standing rigging on a sailing vessel that runs from the mast to either its transom or rear quarter, counteracting the forestay and jib. It is an important sail trim control and has a direct effect on the shape of the mainsail and the headsail. Backstays are generally adjusted by block and tackle, hydraulic adjusters, or lines leading to winches.

==Types==
Backstays may be &quot;permanent&quot; or &quot;running&quot;.

=== Permanent backstay ===
A permanent backstay is attached to the top of the mast. Running backstays appear in pairs attached about two-thirds of the way up the mast (sometimes at multiple locations along the length of the mast). In general, most modern sailboats have a permanent backstay and some have a permanent backstay combined with running backstays. Backstays are not always found on all vessels, especially smaller ones.

A permanent backstay is attached at the top of the mast and may or may not be readily adjustable. In a masthead rig, tensioning the permanent backstay directly tensions the forestay. This control is used to adjust the amount of &quot;sag&quot; in the headsail. In a fractional rig, tensioning the permanent backstay has two effects: First, the forestay is tensioned (controls sag in headsail) and second, the mast bend is increased, particularly in the upper one-half to one-third of the mast. Increased mast bend tends to reduce the draft (camber) of the mainsail.

=== Running backstay ===
A running backstay always attaches to the mast at a point below the top of the mast and is generally used in conjunction with a permanent backstay. Running backstays are found on both masthead rigs and fractional rigs. There are some rigs for which running backstays may be used without a permanent backstay. This occurs most often where the mainsail has a significant roach or a very large mainsail, especially combined with narrow hull beam. Gaff rigged boats invariably have running backstays with no permanent backstay. In both of these cases the mainsail extends aft of a line from masthead to stern, and so a permanent backstay would interfere with the operation of the sail. As a direct consequence of its attachment point (below the top of the mast) a running backstay is always adjustable because it must be manually engaged and disengaged during every tack or jibe. Adjusting the tension on the running backstay has two effects: First, the forestay is tensioned (controls sag in headsail) and Second, mast bend is increased (the mast becomes more bent). The overall effect of tensioning the running backstay is a shallower mainsail (less camber) combined with a reduction in headsail sag.

If the running backstays lead to the mast where the forestay attaches, the effect of tensioning them is to reduce sag in the headsail, increase mast bend, and flatten the mainsail as a result. Both effects are desirable as the wind increases.

==Backstay insulators==
Backstay insulators, when used as a pair, are devices which allow for the electrical isolation of a section of wire on a yacht (e.g. the backstay) so that it can be used as an antenna for a single sideband (SSB) radio. They can also be used to reduce the risk to a yacht&#x27;s crew in the event of a lightning strike.

Since these insulators form part of the rigging, not only must they not leak current, but they must also be strong and durable enough not to fail mechanically under the sometimes tough load conditions experienced in sailing.

<doc id="333969" wikidata="Q9370917" url="?curid=333969" title="Shroud (sailing)">
<text>On a sailing boat, the shrouds are pieces of standing rigging which hold the mast up from side to side. There is frequently more than one shroud on each side of the boat.

Usually a shroud will connect at the top of the mast, and additional shrouds might connect partway down the mast, depending on the design of the boat. Shrouds terminate at their bottom ends at the chain plates, which are tied into the hull. They are sometimes held outboard by channels, a ledge that keeps the shrouds clear of the gunwales.

Shrouds are attached symmetrically on both the port and starboard sides. For those shrouds which attach high up the mast, a structure projecting from the mast must be used to increase the angle of the shroud at the attachment point, providing more support to the mast. On most sailing boats, such structures are called spreaders, and the shrouds they hold continue down to the deck. On large sailing ships, however, particularly square-riggers, the shrouds end at the projections (called tops or crosstrees) and their loads are carried into the mast slightly further down by futtock shrouds.

Contrast with forestay and backstay.

<doc id="333973" wikidata="Q1334055" url="?curid=333973" title="Standing rigging">
<text>Standing rigging comprises the fixed lines, wires, or rods, which support each mast or bowsprit on a sailing vessel and reinforce those spars against wind loads transferred from the sails. This term is used in contrast to running rigging, which represents the moveable elements of rigging which adjust the position and shape of the sails.

==Historical development==

Early sailing vessels used rope of hemp or other fibers, which gave way to wire ropes of various types. Galvanized steel was common for the first half of the 20th century, continuing as an inexpensive option to its 1960s successor material—stainless steel cables and rods. In the late 20th Century, racing yachts adopted composite fiber lines for standing rigging, with the goal of reducing weight and windage aloft.

== Materials ==
On modern yachts, standing rigging is often stainless steel wire, Nitronic-50 stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire is by far the most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strands (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires professional inspection such as dye penetrate testing or x-raying. Rod rigging is strongest when terminated with a cold head rather than swage fittings. This process requires a different, expensive machine but yields a more durable end fitting. Rod-type stays fail suddenly (rather than strand by strand as a cable would), often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.

==Fore-and-aft rigged vessels==
Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels have the following types of standing rigging: 
a forestay, a backstay, and upper and lower shrouds (side stays).
Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both of these are used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind.
Rigging parts include swageless terminals, swage terminals, shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.

==Square-rigged vessels==

Whereas 20th-century square-rigged vessels were constructed of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the &quot;lower mast&quot;, &quot;top mast&quot;, and &quot;topgallant mast&quot;. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs of deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—&quot;lanyard&quot;—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.

===Lateral support===
In addition to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that connected to either a platform, called a &quot;top&quot;, or cross-wise beams, called &quot;crosstrees&quot;, and anchored futtock shrouds from below that led to the lower mast.

===Fore-and-aft support===
Each additional mast segment was supported fore and aft by a series of stays that led forward. These lines were countered in tension by backstays, which were secured along the sides of the vessel behind the shrouds.

<text>John Avery Lomax (September 23, 1867 – January 26, 1948) was an American teacher, a pioneering musicologist, and a folklorist who did much for the preservation of American folk music. He was the father of Alan Lomax, John Lomax Jr. and Bess Lomax Hawes, also distinguished collectors of folk music.

==Early life==
The Lomax family originally came from England with William Lomax, who settled in Rockingham County in what was then &quot;the colony of North Carolina.&quot; John Lomax was born in Goodman in Holmes County in central Mississippi, to James Avery Lomax and the former Susan Frances Cooper. In December 1869, the Lomax family traveled by ox cart from Mississippi to Texas. John Lomax grew up in central Texas, just north of Meridian in rural Bosque County. His father raised horses and cattle and grew cotton and corn on the of bottomland that he had purchased near the Bosque River. He was exposed to cowboy songs as a child. At around nine he befriended Nat Blythe, a former slave hired as a farmhand by James Lomax. The friendship, he wrote later, &quot;perhaps gave my life its bent.&quot; Lomax, whose own schooling was sporadic because of the heavy farmwork he was forced to do, taught Blythe to read and write, and Blythe taught Lomax songs including &quot;Big Yam Potatoes on a Sandy Land&quot; and dance steps such as &quot;Juba&quot;. When Blythe was 21 years old, he took his savings and left. Lomax never saw him again and heard rumors that he had been murdered. For years afterward, he always looked for Nat when he traveled around the South.

When he was about to turn twenty-one, and his legal obligation to work as apprentice on his father&#x27;s farm was coming to an end, his father permitted him to take the profits from the crops of one of their fields. Lomax used this, along with the money from selling his favorite pony, to pay to further his education. In the fall of 1887, he attended Granbury College in Granbury and in May 1888, he graduated and eventually became a teacher. He began his first job as a teacher at a country school in Clifton, southeast of Meridian. As time went on, he grew tired of the low pay and country-school drudgery and he applied for work at Weatherford College in Weatherford in Parker County in the spring of 1889. He was hired as principal by the school&#x27;s new president, David Switzer, who had previously been president of Granbury College until it was closed down and he was transferred to Weatherford. In 1890, after having attended a summer course at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Lomax returned to Texas where he became head of the Business Department of Weatherford College. Each summer, between 1891 and 1894, he also attended the annual lecture-and-concert series at New York State&#x27;s Chautauqua Institute, which pioneered adult education (and where Lomax himself would later lecture). According to Porterfield, &quot;There he improved his mathematics, struggled with Latin, listened to music that stirred him (opera and oratorios, light &#x27;classics&#x27; of the day), and learned, for the first time, of two poets—Tennyson and Browning—whose work would soon become an integral part of his intellectual equipment.&quot;

==Early career==
Lomax decided to further his education at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, but he realized he would likely fail its tough entrance examinations. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a double course load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote:

Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua-educated country boy who couldn&#x27;t conjugate an English verb or decline a pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don&#x27;t think I ever stopped to think how foolish it all was.
In his memoir, &quot;Adventures of a Ballad Hunter&quot;, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as &quot;cheap and unworthy,&quot; prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men&#x27;s dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor-in-chief of the &quot;University of Texas Magazine&quot;. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the &quot;Alcalde&quot;, a student newspaper. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men&#x27;s dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title &quot;Sybillene Priest&quot;.

Sometime around July 1898 Lomax began an intense relationship with Shirley Green of Palestine, Texas, to whom he had been introduced in 1897 by the president of the University of Texas. For four years, their friendship had its ups and downs, until June 1902, when Lomax met one of Green&#x27;s acquaintances, Bess Baumann Brown from Dallas. It ultimately emerged that the reason for Green&#x27;s reluctance to commit herself to an engagement to John Lomax had been her awareness that she was mortally ill with tuberculosis. However, Lomax continued to exchange letters with Green until a month before her death, which occurred in February 1903. That year, Lomax accepted an offer to teach English at Texas A&amp;M University beginning in September To bolster his credentials, in the meantime, he decided to enroll at the University of Chicago for a summer course. Upon his return to Texas he became engaged to Bess Brown and they married on June 9, 1904, in Austin. The couple settled down at College Station near the A&amp;M campus. Their first child, Shirley, was born on August 7, 1905.

Lomax, aware of the deficiencies of his early education, still wished to improve himself, however, and on September 26, 1906, he jumped at the chance to attend Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a graduate student, having previously received a $500 stipend: The Austin Teaching Fellowships. Here he had the opportunity to study under Barrett Wendell and George Lyman Kittredge, two renowned scholars who actively encouraged his interest in cowboy songs. Harvard, in fact, was the center of American folklore studies (then viewed as a subsidiary of English literature, itself a novel field of scholarship in comparison with the more traditional study of rhetoric focused on classical languages and geared to preparing lawyers and clergy). Kittredge, in addition to being a well-known scholar of Chaucer and Shakespeare, had inherited the professorship in English literature previously held by Francis James Child, whose courses he continued to teach and whose great, unfinished eight-volume edition of the &quot;Popular Ballads of England and Scotland&quot; he brought to completion.

It was Kittredge who pioneered modern methods of ballad study, and who encouraged collectors to get out of their armchairs and library halls and to get out into the countryside to collect ballads first hand. When he met John Lomax in 1907, this was what he encouraged him to do; the cowboy songs Lomax had been writing down were glimpses into a whole new world, and Lomax should follow up on his work. &quot;Go and get this material while it can be found,&quot; he told the young Texan. &quot;Preserve the words and music. That&#x27;s your job.&quot;

Wendell and Kittredge continued to play an important advisory role in Lomax&#x27;s career after he returned to Texas in June 1907 to resume his teaching position at A&amp;M after completing his Master of Arts degree. This included a visit by the two professors to Texas during which Lomax took them to a Sunday service in an African-American church.

Soon after his return to Austin, John Lomax&#x27;s son, John Jr., was born, on June 14, 1907. Galvanized by Kittredge&#x27;s advice and support, Lomax had begun collecting cowboy songs and ballads, but his work was interrupted on February 7, 1908, when &quot;The Great A&amp;M Strike&quot; broke out. The strike, caused by student dissatisfaction with the administration, continued even after February 14, 1908, when the University, in a conciliatory gesture, fired some of its administrators. Unable to teach because of the strike, Lomax decided to see about resuming his collecting of cowboy ballads with a view to publishing them in a book. Encouraged by Wendell, he applied for and was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship grant. In June 1908, Lomax became a full professor at A&amp;M. That August the strike ended when the President of the University resigned. In June 1910, Lomax accepted an administrative job at the University of Texas as &quot;Secretary of the University Faculties and Assistant Director of the Department of Extension.&quot;

In November 1910 the anthology, &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot;, was published by Sturgis and Walton, with an introduction by former president Theodore Roosevelt. Among the songs included were &quot;Jesse James&quot;, &quot;The Old Chisholm Trail&quot;, &quot;Sweet Betsy From Pike&quot;, and &quot;The Buffalo Skinners&quot; (which George Lyman Kittredge considered &quot;one of the greatest western ballads&quot; and which was praised for its Homeric quality by Carl Sandburg and Virgil Thomson.) From the first, John Lomax insisted on the inclusiveness of American culture. Some of the most famous songs in the book — &quot;Git Along Little Dogies&quot;, &quot;Sam Bass,&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; — were sourced from African-American cowboys. Before &quot;Home on the Range&quot; was published Lomax recorded a black saloon keeper in San Antonio singing it on an Edison cylinder.

&quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot; emerged as a major collection of Western songs and had &quot;a profound effect on other folk song students.&quot;. According to noted folklore scholar, D. K. Wilgus, the book&#x27;s publication &quot;sparked a great surge of interest in folk songs of all kinds, and in fact, inspired a search for folk material in all regions of the nation.&quot; Its success transformed John A. Lomax into a nationally known figure.

==Texas Folklore Society==
Around the same time, Lomax and Professor Leonidas Payne of the University of Texas at Austin co-founded the Texas Folklore Society, following Kittredge&#x27;s suggestion that Lomax establish a Texas branch of the American Folklore Society. Lomax and Payne hoped that the society would further their own research while kindling an interest in folklore among like-minded Texans. On Thanksgiving Day, 1909, Lomax nominated Payne as president of the society, and Payne nominated Lomax as first secretary. The two set out to marshal support, and a month later, Killis Campbell, an associate professor at the University, publicly proposed the formation of the Society at a meeting of the Texas State Teachers Association in Dallas. By April 1910, there were 92 charter members.

Lomax then used his prestige as a nationally known author to travel the country raising money for folklore studies and to establish other state folklore societies. &quot;He was among the first scholars to present papers about American folk songs to the Modern Language Association, the nation&#x27;s leading organization of teachers of languages and literature. For the next several years he hit the lecture circuit, traveling so often that his wife, Bess Brown, had to help him with his schedules and even some of his speeches.&quot; His lectures on cowboy songs, ballads and poetry took him all across the eastern USA. For example, in December 1911, Lomax made a successful performance at Cornell University, singing and reciting some of the cowboy songs he had collected. Sometimes he would have a chorus of college students dress up as cowboys to add interest to his presentations.

Lomax&#x27;s abiding interest in African-American folklore was also in evidence, for he had plans to publish another book within a year that consisted of folk songs collected from African-Americans. Although the book failed to materialize, he did publish (in the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;, December 1912) &quot;Stories of an African Prince&quot;, a collection of 16 African stories, which he had obtained through his correspondence with a young Nigerian student, Lattevi Ajayi. In 1912, with the backing of Kittredge, John A. Lomax was elected president of the American Folklore Society, with Kittredge (himself a former president of the society) as First Vice President. He was re-elected for a second term in 1913. In 1922, J. Frank Dobie became secretary-treasurer of the Texas Folklore Society, a job he was to hold for 21 years.

Lomax&#x27;s second son (and third child), Alan, was born on January 15, 1915. In time, Alan Lomax would prove a worthy successor of his father. A second daughter, Bess, was born in 1921, and she too had a distinguished career, both as a performer and teacher.

The Texas Folklore Society grew gradually over the next decade, with Lomax steering it forward. At his invitation, Kittredge and Wendell attended its meetings. Other early members were Stith Thompson and J. Frank Dobie, who both began teaching English at the university in 1914. In 1915, at Lomax&#x27;s recommendation, Stith Thompson became the society&#x27;s secretary-treasurer. In 1916, Lomax&#x27;s voluminous encyclopedia, &quot;The Book of Texas&quot;, which he had written jointly with Harry Yandall Benedict, was published. The same year, Stith Thompson edited the first volume of the &quot;Publications of the Texas Folklore Society&quot;, which Dobie reissued as &quot;Round the Levee&quot; in 1935. This publication exemplified the society&#x27;s express purpose, and the motivation behind Lomax&#x27;s own work: to gather a body of folklore before it disappeared, and to preserve it for the analysis of later scholars. These early efforts foreshadowed what would become Lomax&#x27;s greatest achievement, the collection of more than ten thousand recordings for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. In the inaugural issue of the &quot;Publications of the Texas Folklore Society&quot;, John A. Lomax urged the collection of Texas folklore: &quot;Two rich and practically unworked fields in Texas are found in the large Negro and Mexican populations of the state.&quot; He adds, &quot;Here are many problems of research that lie close at hand, not buried in musty tomes and incomplete records, but in vital human personalities.&quot;

Throughout the next seven years he continued his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members as the result of a political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson &amp; Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would be wrong to leave his post at Lee, Higginson &amp; Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, &quot;American Songbag&quot; (1927). In 1919, his next book, &quot;Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp&quot;, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of &quot;The Alcade&quot;, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.

==Archive of American Folk Song==

In 1931, Lomax&#x27;s wife Bess Brown died at the age of 50, leaving four children (the youngest, Bess, was ten years old). In addition, the Dallas bank at which Lomax worked failed: he had to phone his customers one by one to announce that their investments were all worthless. In debt and unemployed and with two school-age children to support, the sixty-five-year-old went into a deep depression. In hope of reviving his father&#x27;s spirits, his oldest son, John Lomax Jr. encouraged him to begin a new series of lecture tours. They took to the road, camping out by the side of the road to save money, with John Jr. (and later Alan Lomax) serving the senior Lomax as driver and personal assistant. In June 1932, they arrived at the offices of the Macmillan publishing company in New York City. Here Lomax proposed his idea for an anthology of American ballads and folksongs, with a special emphasis on the contributions of African Americans. It was accepted. In preparation he traveled to Washington to review the holdings in the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress.

By the time of Lomax&#x27;s arrival, the Archive already contained a collection of commercial phonograph recordings that straddled the boundaries between commercial and folk, and wax cylinder field recordings, built up under the leadership of Robert Winslow Gordon, Head of the Archive, and Carl Engel, chief of the Music Division. Gordon had also experimented in the field with a portable disc recorder, but had had neither time nor resources to do significant fieldwork. Lomax found the recorded holdings of the Archive woefully inadequate for his purposes. He therefore made an arrangement with the Library whereby it would provide recording equipment, obtained for it by Lomax through private grants, in exchange for which he would travel the country making field recordings to be deposited in the Archive of the Library, then the major resource for printed and recorded material in the United States

After the departure of Robert Gordon from the Library in 1934, John A. Lomax was named Honorary Consultant and Curator of the Archive of American Folk Song, a title he held until his death in 1948. His work, for which he was paid a salary of one dollar, included fund raising for the Library, and he was expected to support himself entirely through writing books and giving lectures. Lomax secured grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation, among others, for continued field recordings. He and Alan recorded Spanish ballads and &quot;vaquero&quot; songs on the Rio Grande border and spent weeks among French-speaking Cajuns in southern Louisiana.

Thus began a ten-year relationship with the Library of Congress that would involve not only John but the entire Lomax family, including his second wife, Ruby Terrill Lomax, Professor of Classics and Dean of Women at the University of Texas, whom he married in 1934. His sons and daughters assisted with his folksong research and with the daily operations of the Archive: Shirley, who performed songs taught to her by her mother; John Jr., who encouraged his father&#x27;s association with the Library; Alan Lomax who accompanied John on field trips and who from 1937 to 1942 served as the Archive&#x27;s first paid (though very nominally) employee as Assistant in Charge; and Bess, who spent her weekends and school vacations copying song texts and doing comparative song research.

==Field recordings==

Through a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, Lomax was able to set out in June 1933 on the first recording expedition under the Library&#x27;s auspices, with Alan Lomax (then eighteen years old) in tow. As now, a disproportionate percentage of African American males were held as prisoners. Robert Winslow Gordon, Lomax&#x27;s predecessor at the Library of Congress, had written (in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, c. 1926) that, &quot;Nearly every type of song is to be found in our prisons and penitentiaries&quot; Folklorists Howard Odum and Guy Johnson also had observed that, &quot;If one wishes to obtain anything like an accurate picture of the workaday Negro he will surely find his best setting in the chain gang, prison, or in the situation of the ever-fleeing fugitive.&quot; But what these folklorists had merely recommended John and Alan Lomax were able to put into practice. In their successful grant application they wrote, following Odum, Johnson and Gordon&#x27;s hint, that prisoners, &quot;Thrown on their own resources for entertainment ... still sing, especially the long-term prisoners who have been confined for years and who have not yet been influenced by jazz and the radio, the distinctive old-time Negro melodies.&quot; They toured Texas prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners such as James &quot;Iron Head&quot; Baker, Mose &quot;Clear Rock&quot; Platt, and Lightnin&#x27; Washington. By no means were all of those whom the Lomaxes recorded imprisoned, however: in other communities, they recorded K.C. Gallaway and Henry Truvillion.

In July 1933, they acquired a state-of-the-art, phonograph uncoated-aluminum disk recorder. Installing it in the trunk of his Ford sedan, Lomax soon used it to record, at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, a twelve-string guitar player by the name of Huddie Ledbetter, better known as &quot;Lead Belly,&quot; whom they considered one of their most significant finds. During the next year and a half, father and son continued to make disc recordings of musicians throughout the South.

In contrast to earlier amateur collectors, the Lomaxes were also among the first to attempt to apply scholarly methodology in their work, though they did not adhere to the strict empirical positivism adopted by the subsequent generation of academic folklorists, who believed in refraining from drawing conclusions about the data they amassed.

The following year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged them to make a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes&#x27; recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to have a job in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax&#x27;s scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly&#x27;s manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A&amp;R man Art Satherley of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls and sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly&#x27;s recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel of Lomax&#x27;s discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax&#x27;s two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again.

John A. Lomax has been accused of paternalism and of tailoring Lead Belly&#x27;s repertoire and clothing during his brief association with Lead Belly. &quot;But,&quot; writes jazz historian Ted Gioia,

few would deny the instrumental role he played in the transformation of the one-time convict into a commercially successful performer of traditional African American music. The turnabout in his life was rapid and profound: Lead Belly was released from prison on August 1, 1934; his schedule for the last week of December that year included performances for the MLA gathering in Philadelphia, for an afternoon tea in Bryn Mawr, and for an informal gathering of professors from Columbia and NYU. Even by the standards of the entertainment industry ... this was a remarkable transformation.

After his three-months as a performer illustrating John A. Lomax&#x27;s lectures, Lead Belly went on to a 15-year career as an independent artist, championed and assisted intermittently (but not managed) by Alan Lomax.

In 1938 John Lomax visited noted writer Ben Robertson in Pickens County, South Carolina, where Robertson introduced him to the all-day singing festivals of the area which enabled Lomax to preserve the lyrics of many local folk songs.

==The scope of the collection==
The Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress contains songs collected in 33 states of the Union and certain parts of the West Indies, The Bahamas, and Haiti. As Curator and Assistant in Charge of the Folk Song Collection John and Alan Lomax supervised and worked with many other folklorists, musicologists, and composers, amateur and professional, all over the country, amassing more than ten thousand records of vocal and instrumental music on aluminum and acetate discs along with many pages of written documentation.

In his 1942 introduction to the multi-volume &quot;Checklist of Recorded Folk Song in the Library of Congress&quot;, Harold Spivacke, Chief of the Library of Congress&#x27;s Division of Music, wrote:

Many hard-working and expert folklorists cooperated in the accumulation of this material, but in the main the development of the Archive of American Folk Song represents the work of two men, John and Alan Lomax. Starting in 1933, the Lomaxes, father and son, traveled tens of thousands of miles, endured many hardships, exercised great patience and tact to win the confidence and friendship of hundreds of singers in order to bring to the Library of Congress records of the voices of countless interesting people they met on the way. Very much remains to be done to make our Archive truly representative of all the people, but the country owes a debt of gratitude to these two men for the excellent foundation laid for future work in this field. ... The Lomaxes received much help in their expeditions from many interested folklorists, some of whom have made important contributions to the Archive as a result of independent expeditions of their own. To these the Library wishes to take this opportunity to express its deep gratitude. They include Gordon Barnes, Mary E. Barnicle, E. C. Beals, Barbara Bell, Paul Brewster, Genevieve Chandler, Richard Chase, Fletcher Collins, Carita D. Corse, Sidney Robertson Cowell, Dr. E. K. Davis, Kay Dealy, Seamus Doyle, Charles Draves, Marjorie Edgar, John Henry Faulk, Richard Fento, Helen Hartness Flanders, Frank Goodwin, Percy Grainger, Herbert Halpert, Melville Herskovits, Zora Neale Hurston, Myra Hull, George Pullen Jackson, Stetson Kennedy, Bess Lomax, Elizabeth Lomax, Ruby Terrill Lomax, Eloise Linscott, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Walter McClintock, Alton Morris, Juan B. Rael, Vance Randolph, Helen Roberts, Domingo Santa Cruz, Charles Seeger, Mrs. Nicol Smith, Robert Sonkin, Ruby Pickens Tartt, Jean Thomas, Charles Todd, Margaret Valliant, Ivan Walton, Irene Whitfield, John Woods, and John W. Work III.

This checklist has been prepared as a result of countless requests. ... Its appearance at this time is indeed appropriate since it is natural for a nation at war to try to evaluate and exploit to the fullest its own cultural heritage. In our folk song may be found some of the profoundedst currents that have run through American history. A mere glance at the titles listed here will be sufficient to show the variety and complexity of the democratic life of our country.

After 1942, field work of collecting folk songs under government auspices was discontinued due to a shortage of acetate needed for the war effort. But the work had aroused the ire and suspicion of Southern conservatives in Congress who were fearful it could be used as a cover for civil and worker rights agitation, and because of congressional opposition it has never been resumed.

==Legacy==

John A. Lomax&#x27;s contribution to the documentation of American folk traditions extended beyond the Library of Congress Music Division through his involvement with two agencies of the Works Progress Administration. In 1936, he was assigned to serve as an advisor on folklore collecting for both the Historical Records Survey and the Federal Writers&#x27; Project. Lomax&#x27;s biographer, Nolan Porterfield, notes that the outlines of the famed WPA State Guides resulting from this work resemble Lomax and Benedict&#x27;s earlier &quot;Book of Texas&quot;.

As the Federal Writers&#x27; Project&#x27;s first Folklore Editor, Lomax also directed the gathering of ex-slave narratives and devised a questionnaire for project fieldworkers to use.

The WPA project to interview former slaves assumed a form and a scope that bore Lomax&#x27;s imprint and reflected his experience and zeal as a collector of folklore. His sense of urgency inspired the efforts in several states. And his prestige and personal influence enlisted the support of many project officials, particularly in the deep South, who might otherwise have been unresponsive to requests for materials of this type. One might question the wisdom of selecting Lomax, a white Southerner to direct a project involving the collection of data from black former slaves. Yet whatever racial preconceptions Lomax may have held do not appear to have had an appreciable effect upon the Slave Narrative Collection. Lomax&#x27;s instructions to interviewers emphasized the necessity of obtaining a faithful account of the ex-slave&#x27;s version of his or her experience. &quot;It should be remembered that the Federal Writers&#x27; Project is not interested in taking sides on any question. The worker should not censor any materials collected regardless of its nature.&quot; Lomax constantly reiterated his insistence that the interviews be recorded verbatim, with no holds barred. In his editorial capacity he closely adhered to this dictum.

Upon Lomax&#x27;s departure this work was continued by Benjamin A. Botkin, who succeeded Lomax as the Project&#x27;s folklore editor in 1938, and at the Library in 1939, resulting in the invaluable compendium of authentic slave narratives: &quot;Lay My Burden Down: A Folk History of Slavery&quot;, edited by B. A. Botkin (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1945).

John A. Lomax served as president of the Texas Folklore Society for the years 1940–41, and 1941–42. In 1947 his autobiography &quot;Adventures of a Ballad Hunter&quot; (New York: Macmillan) was published and was awarded the Carr P. Collins prize as the best book of the year by the Texas Institute of Letters. The book was immediately optioned to be made into a Hollywood movie starring Bing Crosby as Lomax and Josh White as Lead Belly, but the project was never realized.

In 1932, Lomax met his friend, Henry Zweifel, a rancher and businessman then from Cleburne in Johnson County, while both were volunteers for Orville Bullington&#x27;s Republican gubernatorial race against the Democrat Miriam Ferguson. Lomax&#x27;s old enemy, James Ferguson, was virtually running his wife&#x27;s comeback attempt at the governorship.

Lomax died of a stroke at the age of eighty in January 1948. On June 15 of that year, Lead Belly gave a concert at the University of Texas, performing children&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot; and spirituals (performed with his wife Martha) that he had first sung years before for the late collector.

In 2010, John A. Lomax was inducted into the Western Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to the field of cowboy music.

Following in his grandfather&#x27;s footsteps, Lomax&#x27;s grandson John Lomax III is a nationally published United States music journalist, author of &quot;Nashville: Music City USA&quot; (1986), &quot;Red Desert Sky&quot; (2001) and co-author of &quot;The Country Music Book&quot; (1988). He is also an artist manager and has represented Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Rocky Hill, David Schnaufer and The Cactus Brothers. He began representing the Dead Ringer Band in 1996. John Lomax III was also a music writer for Houston&#x27;s early-1970s underground newspaper, &quot;Space City!&quot;

<text>Atypidae, also known as atypical tarantulas or purseweb spiders, is a spider family containing only three genera. They are accomplished ambush predators that spend most of their time in a sock-like, silken retreat on the ground from where they kill their prey.

==Distribution==
&quot;Sphodros&quot; and &quot;Atypus&quot; occur in North America, while &quot;Atypus&quot; and &quot;Calommata&quot; occur in Asia and Africa. Only &quot;Atypus&quot; species are found in Europe. &quot;Atypus affinis&quot;, &quot;Atypus muralis&quot;, and &quot;Atypus piceus&quot; are the only mygalomorph spiders found in Central Europe.

==Biology==
&quot;Atypus&quot; builds a silken tube parallel to the surface of the ground. While up to 8 cm of the tube lie on the ground, about 20 cm are buried vertically. The spider rests at the bottom of the tube. When prey walks on the exposed part, the spider, alerted by the vibrations, stabs the prey through the silk, cuts the web and drags the prey inside to be eaten. &quot;Calommata&quot; species, instead of building a purseweb, live in burrows.
&quot;Sphodros&quot; spp. usually prop their tubes against a tree trunk.

Atypical tarantulas have huge chelicerae for their size and relatively long spinnerets (although not as long as those found in diplurids). The males are sometimes brightly colored and wander around looking for females in their tubes. The females are reddish-brown or dark-colored.

During the breeding season for &quot;A. affinis&quot;, the male leaves his own burrow and goes in search of females. When he finds the burrow of a female, he tentatively taps on the wall of the purseweb, and if the female is receptive, he ventures into the confines of the burrow. The two spiders mate and cohabit until the male dies, when the female eats him. The female makes an egg sac and hangs it in her burrow. The next summer, the eggs hatch, and the spring after that, the spiderlings leave their mother&#x27;s burrow and wander off to find a suitable place to build a lair of their own.

Southeast Asian &quot;Atypus&quot; species have a body length of 7 to 21 mm in females, and about 12 mm in males. &quot;Calommata&quot; spp. of this region grow from 23 to 30 mm in females, and only about 7 mm in males.
==Genera==
, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

*&quot;Atypus&quot; — Britain to Ukraine, Asia, North Africa, United States
*&quot;Calommata&quot; — Asia, South Africa
*&quot;Sphodros&quot; — North America
