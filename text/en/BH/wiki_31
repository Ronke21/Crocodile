<text>Betty Hutton (born Elizabeth June Thornburg; February 26, 1921 – March 12, 2007)
was an American stage, film, and television actress, comedian, dancer, and singer. She rose to fame in the 1940s as a contract player for Paramount Pictures, appearing primarily in musicals and became one of the studio&#x27;s most valuable stars. She was noted for her energetic performance style.

Raised in Detroit during the Great Depression by a single mother who worked as a bootlegger, Hutton began performing as a singer from a young age, entertaining patrons of her mother&#x27;s speakeasy. While performing in local nightclubs, she was discovered by orchestra leader Vincent Lopez, who hired her as a singer in his band. 

In 1940, Hutton was cast in the Broadway productions &quot;Two for the Show&quot; and &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, and attracted notice for her raucous and animated live performances. She relocated to Los Angeles in 1941 after being signed by Paramount Pictures, and concurrently recorded numerous singles for Capitol Records. Her breakthrough role came in Preston Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1944), and she went on to receive further notice for her lead role as Annie Oakley in the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950), and for Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952). She made her final feature film appearance in &quot;Spring Reunion&quot; (1957).

After leaving Paramount, Hutton starred in her own series, &quot;The Betty Hutton Show&quot;, from 1959 until 1960. She continued to perform in stage productions, though her career faltered following a series of personal struggles, including chronic depression, alcoholism, and prescription drug addiction. Hutton largely abandoned her performing career by the 1970s, and found employment in a Rhode Island rectory after becoming nearly destitute. She returned to the stage temporarily replacing Alice Ghostley in the original Broadway production of &quot;Annie&quot; in 1980. 

In her later life, Hutton attended Salve Regina University, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1986. After working as an acting instructor at Emerson College, Hutton returned to California in 1999 and resided in Palm Springs, where she died in 2007, aged 86.

==Early life==
Hutton was born Elizabeth June Thornburg on February 26, 1921, in Battle Creek, Michigan, the youngest of two daughters of Percy Thornburg, a railroad brakeman, and Mabel Thornburg (née Lum). When she was two years old, her father abandoned the family. They did not hear of him again until they received a telegram years later, informing them of his suicide. Betty and her older sister, Marion, were raised by their single mother, who was an alcoholic. 

Hutton&#x27;s formative years during the Great Depression were marked by poverty, with Hutton&#x27;s mother supporting herself and her two children by working as an automobile upholsterer and running an illegal speakeasy out of her home in Lansing, Michigan. There, Hutton and her sister regularly performed songs to entertain customers of the speakeasy.

Due to her mother&#x27;s bootlegging of alcohol during prohibition, the family relocated frequently to evade police, eventually settling in Detroit when she was eight years old. Recalling her childhood, Hutton said: &quot;Mom just ran a joint on a small scale. We&#x27;d operate until the cops got wise. Then they&#x27;d move in and close us down, and we&#x27;d move somewhere else. Marion and I would entertain the customers by dancing and singing. We really lived that way until we were 12 and 14 years old...  Things were really tough. At one time we were down to one can of beans.&quot;

Hutton attended Foch Intermediate School in Detroit before dropping out in ninth grade. She sang in several local bands as a teenager, and at 15 attempted to find stage work in New York City; her efforts proved unsuccessful, after which she returned to Detroit.

==Career==
===1938–1940: Music and Broadway===
In 1938, Hutton was discovered by orchestra leader Vincent Lopez while she was performing as a singer in local Detroit nightclubs. Lopez recruited her as a member in his band, and she began touring with them as a singer, billed as Betty Jane. During her tenure with the band, Hutton established a distinctive &quot;whoop and holler&quot; vocal style. Lopez, an adherent of numerology, used his numerology practice to rebrand her with the stage name Betty Hutton: &quot;I tried to get a vibration that would make her a lot of money. It was a five-eight vibration. After that she did fine.&quot; Through her work with Lopez, Hutton was hired to appear in several musical shorts for Warner Bros.: &quot;Queens of the Air&quot; (1938), &quot;Three Kings and a Queen&quot; (1939), &quot;Public Jitterbug No. 1&quot; (1939), and &quot;One for the Book&quot; (1940).

In 1940, Hutton was cast in the Broadway production &quot;Two for the Show&quot;, which ran for 124 performances and received rave reviews. Hutton soon became known for her raucous performances onstage, summarized in a 1950 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article:

&quot;Two for the Show&quot; was produced by Buddy DeSylva, who then cast Hutton in &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1940–1942). This was a major hit, running for 501 performances. It starred Ethel Merman; despite rumors through the years that Merman demanded from envy that Hutton&#x27;s musical numbers be reduced from the show, more careful reports demonstrate that producer DeSylva chose to cut just one song of three, &quot;They Ain&#x27;t Done Right by Our Nell&quot;, due to Hutton&#x27;s &quot;always in overdrive&quot; performance style.

===1941–1949: Paramount contract and breakthrough===

When DeSylva became a producer at Paramount Pictures, he offered Hutton a contract with the studio, and she relocated to Los Angeles. She was first cast in a featured role in &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot; (1942), starring Paramount&#x27;s number-one female star Dorothy Lamour, alongside Eddie Bracken and William Holden. The film was popular and Hutton was an instant hit with the moviegoing public.

Hutton was one of the many Paramount contract artists who appeared in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1942). The same year, she was signed to the newly-formed Capitol Records and recorded a number of singles over the following several years, marking one of the label&#x27;s earliest recording artists. Meanwhile, Paramount did not immediately promote her to major stardom, but gave the second lead in a Mary Martin film musical, &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot; (1943). The response was positive, and Hutton was given co-star billing with Bob Hope in &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; (1943). During that year, she made $1250 per week.
In 1942, writer-director Preston Sturges cast Hutton in &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; as a dopey but endearing small-town girl who gives local troops a happy send-off and wakes up married and pregnant, but with no memory of who her husband is. The film was delayed by Hays Office objections and Sturges&#x27; prolific output, and was finally released early in 1944. The film made Hutton a major star; Sturges was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar, the film was named to the National Film Board&#x27;s Top Ten films for the year, and the National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture of 1944, and awarded Betty Hutton the award for Best Acting for her performance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942–1944.

Critic James Agee noted that &quot;the Hays office must have been raped in its sleep&quot; to allow the film to be released. And although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of the film&#x27;s subject matter, it was Paramount&#x27;s highest-grossing film of 1944, playing to standing room-only audiences in some theatres.

She was next cast in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; (1944) with Fred MacMurray and Dorothy Lamour, and &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot; (1944) with Bing Crosby. Both were huge hits. DeSylva, one of Capitol&#x27;s founders, also co-produced her next hit, the musical &quot;Incendiary Blonde&quot; (1945), where she played Texas Guinan. It was directed by veteran comedy director George Marshall and Hutton had replaced Lamour as Paramount&#x27;s top female box-office attraction. Hutton was one of many Paramount stars in &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; (1945), and was top billed in &quot;The Stork Club&quot; (1945) with Barry Fitzgerald, produced by DeSylva. Hutton went into &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; (1946) with Sonny Tufts, which she disliked. She did however enjoy the popular &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1947), directed by Marshall, where she sang a Frank Loesser song that was nominated for an Oscar: &quot;I Wish I Didn&#x27;t Love You So&quot;. The recording sold over a million copies worldwide and reached number six in the U.S. charts.

Hutton&#x27;s relationship with Paramount began to disintegrate when DeSylva left the studio due to illness (he died in 1950). &quot;After he left I started doing scripts that I knew weren&#x27;t good for me.&quot;

Hutton made &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1948) with MacDonald Carey, which she later said, &quot;almost ruined me.&quot; She did &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot; (1949) with Victor Mature, which she also disliked.

===1950–1958: &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, film career decline===

Hutton acted in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Next, she was billed above Fred Astaire in the 1950 musical &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. 
Hutton was one of several stars in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952), an epic drama directed by Cecil B. DeMille about performers in a circus which won two Academy Awards: Best Picture and Best Story. Hutton portrayed a trapeze artist in the film, and trained extensively for the role for six months, allowing her to perform many of her own stunts. She made an unbilled cameo in &quot;Sailor Beware&quot; (1952) with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, a remake of &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot;, in which she portrayed Dean&#x27;s girlfriend, Hetty Button.

She made &quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot; (1952), a biography of singer Blossom Seeley, with Ralph Meeker.

Hutton then clashed with Paramount. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the dispute resulted from her insistence that her husband at the time, choreographer Charles O&#x27;Curran, direct her in a film.

In April 1952, Hutton returned to Broadway, performing in &quot;Betty Hutton and Her All-Star International Show&quot;. In July 1952, she announced that her husband and she would form a production company. She left Paramount in August.

Hutton transitioned to radio work, and appeared in Las Vegas, where she had a great success performing in live theater productions. She had the rights to a screenplay about Sophie Tucker, but was unable to raise funds. In 1954, TV producer Max Liebman, of comedian Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, fashioned his first &quot;Color Spectacular&quot; as an original musical written especially for Hutton, &quot;Satins and Spurs&quot;. Hutton&#x27;s last completed film was a small one, &quot;Spring Reunion&quot; (1957). It was a financial disappointment. She also became disillusioned with Capitol&#x27;s management and moved to RCA Victor. In 1957, she appeared on a Dinah Shore show on NBC that also featured Boris Karloff; the program has been preserved on a kinescope.

===1959–1964: Television work===
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz took a chance on Hutton in 1959, with their company Desilu Productions giving her a CBS sitcom, &quot;The Betty Hutton Show&quot;. Hutton hired the still-blacklisted and future film composer Jerry Fielding to direct her series. They had met over the years in Las Vegas when he was blacklisted from TV and radio and could get no other work, and her Hollywood career was also fading. It was Fielding&#x27;s first network job since losing his post as musical director of Groucho Marx&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in 1953 after hostile questioning by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. &quot;The Betty Hutton Show&quot; ended after 30 episodes.

Hutton continued headlining in Las Vegas and touring across the country. She returned to Broadway briefly in 1964 when she temporarily replaced a hospitalized Carol Burnett in the show &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot;. She guest-starred on shows such as &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

===1965–1979: Personal and financial struggles===
By the early 1960s, Hutton&#x27;s career had declined significantly, attributed to her chronic depression and addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. Turner Classic Movies described her career downswing as &quot;one of the grimmest declines in Hollywood history.&quot; Following the 1962 death of her mother in a house fire, and the collapse of her last marriage, Hutton&#x27;s depression and substance abuse escalated. She divorced her fourth husband, jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli, when she discovered he had fallen in love with Edie Adams (who would become Candoli&#x27;s second wife), and attempted suicide, causing her to lose custody of her youngest daughter, Carolyn, then sixteen years old. She declared bankruptcy the same year. 

In 1967, she was signed to make a comeback starring in two low-budget Westerns for Paramount, but was fired shortly after the projects began. After losing her singing voice in 1970, Hutton had a nervous breakdown and again attempted suicide. She regained control of her life through rehabilitation, and the mentorship of a Catholic priest, Father Peter Maguire. Hutton converted to Catholicism, and took a job as a cook and housekeeper at a rectory in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. She made national headlines when it was revealed she was practically penniless and working in a rectory. Speaking on her conversion to Catholicism, Hutton stated that she had been fascinated by the religion since childhood, though she was raised irreligious by her mother, who was an atheist.

After an aborted comeback in 1974, she was hospitalized with emotional exhaustion. 

Hutton appeared in an interview with Mike Douglas and made a brief guest appearance in 1975 on &quot;Baretta&quot;. In September 1978, Hutton was featured on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, where she extensively discussed her life and career. She was then happily employed as hostess at a Newport, Rhode Island, jai alai arena.

She also appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, which led to a 1978 televised reunion with her two daughters. Hutton began living in a shared home with her divorced daughter and grandchildren in California, but returned to the East Coast for a three-week return to the stage.

===1980–1983: Return to Broadway and academic endeavors===
In 1980, she took over the role of Miss Hannigan during the original Broadway production of &quot;Annie&quot; while Alice Ghostley was on vacation. Ghostley replaced the original Miss Hannigan actress, Dorothy Loudon (who won a Tony Award for the role).

Hutton&#x27;s rehearsal of the song &quot;Little Girls&quot; was featured on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Hutton&#x27;s Broadway comeback was also included in a profile on &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; about her life, her struggle with pills, and her recovery.

A ninth-grade drop-out, Hutton went back to school and earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Salve Regina University in 1986. During her time at university, Hutton became friends with fellow student and singer-songwriter Kristin Hersh, and attended several early concerts of Hersh&#x27;s band, Throwing Muses. Hersh later wrote the song &quot;Elizabeth June&quot; as a tribute to Hutton, and wrote about their relationship in further detail in her memoir, &quot;Rat Girl&quot; (2010).

After completing her master&#x27;s degree, Hutton worked as a drama instructor at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts.

Hutton&#x27;s last known performance, in any medium, was on &quot;Jukebox Saturday Night&quot;, which aired on PBS in 1983. She became estranged again from her daughters.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Hutton was once engaged to the head of the Warner Bros. makeup department, makeup artist Perc Westmore, in 1942, but broke off the engagement, saying it was because he bored her.

Hutton&#x27;s first marriage was to camera manufacturer Ted Briskin in September 1945. The couple met in a nightclub and she described their meeting as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; The couple had two daughters, Lindsay ( 1946) and Candice ( 1948), before their marriage ended in divorce in 1951. 

Hutton&#x27;s second marriage in 1952 was to choreographer Charles O&#x27;Curran. They divorced in 1955. He died in 1984. 

She married husband Alan W. Livingston in 1955, weeks after her divorce from O&#x27;Curran. They divorced in 1960.

Her fourth and final marriage in 1960 was to jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. They divorced in 1967. Hutton and Candoli had one child, Carolyn ( 1962).

===Final years and death===
After the death of her mentor, Father Maguire, Hutton returned to California, moving to Palm Springs in 1999, after decades in New England. Hutton hoped to grow closer to her daughters and grandchildren, as she told Robert Osborne on TCM&#x27;s &quot;Private Screenings&quot; in April 2000, though her children remained distant. She told Osborne that she understood their hesitancy to accept a now elderly mother. The TCM interview first aired on July 18, 2000. The program was rerun as a memorial on the evening of her death in 2007, and again on July 11, 2008, April 14, 2009, January 26, 2010, and as recently as March 18, 2017. as part of TCM&#x27;s memorial tribute for Robert Osborne.
Hutton lived in Palm Springs until her death on March 12, 2007 at the age of 86 from complications of colon cancer. She is buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

<text>Merseyrail is a commuter rail network which serves Merseyside and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire in the North West of England. Merseyrail serves 69 stations, 67 of which it manages, across two lines – the Northern line and the Wirral line. The network uses electrified lines having of routes, of which are underground. Since January 2023, Merseyrail commenced replacing its train fleet, withdrawing the Class 507 and 508 trains and introducing 53 new Class 777 trains. The network carried 28.3 million passengers in the 2023/2024 statistical period.

The concession to operate Merseyrail is held by Merseyrail Electrics 2002, a joint venture between Serco and Transport UK Group (formerly Abellio UK). The concession is awarded by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and is overseen by Merseytravel, the passenger transport executive which co-ordinates public transport across the Liverpool City Region. Merseyrail branding and ticketing is also applied to stations on the City line, which are within the Liverpool City Region but do not form part of the Merseyrail concession.

Merseyrail was established in 1977, when existing railway lines were connected by constructing new tunnels under Liverpool city centre and Birkenhead. The network has since been extended at its peripheries, primarily by electrifying existing lines and transferring the electrified sections into Merseyrail. New stations have also been opened. Seven of the Class 777 trains can operate using batteries, which has allowed the Northern line to extend beyond the electrified track at Kirkby to a new terminus at Headbolt Lane.

Merseyrail has its origins in the underground Mersey Railway of 1886, which forms the core, being the world&#x27;s second underground passenger railway after the 1863 Metropolitan Railway, now a part of London Underground. The network has a number world firsts.

==Network==
The self-contained network is operated by Merseyrail Electrics 2002, a 50:50 joint venture between Serco and Transport UK Group.

The Northern line and the Wirral line compose the electric third-rail part of the network, which has service frequencies of 15minutes in outlying areas converging to rapid transit frequencies in central sections. The lines are electrified throughout using a system, with the exception of the Headbolt Lane line past Fazakerley. Trains on the Northern line and Wirral line cover the Liverpool City Region. The total route length of the two lines is , accommodating 67 stations. The lines connect Liverpool city centre with cities and towns on the outer reaches of the city region, such as Southport, Chester and Ormskirk. Frequent intermediate stops serve other sections of the urban area.

The City line, marked red on the map, is operated primarily by Northern with funding from Merseytravel. The City line is mainly electrified with one branch, the Liverpool to Manchester line via Warrington, operated by diesel trains.

Unlike similar networks in the UK, Merseyrail infrastructure is owned and maintained at a national level by Network Rail. As a self-contained system serving a single City Region, the Northern and Wirral lines are exempt from the national rail franchising structure, which is instead the responsibility of local government. The City line, which shares infrastructure with regional and high-speed services and trains with neighbouring mainline commuter services (particularly that of Manchester), is not part of this exemption.

The three lines interchange as follows:
* Northern and City line services interchange at Liverpool South Parkway and Hunts Cross in the south of the city.
* Wirral and City lines interchange at Lime Street in the city centre.
* Northern and Wirral lines interchange at Liverpool Central and Moorfields in the city centre.

===Northern line===


The Northern line is shown in blue on the Merseyrail and Merseytravel maps and denoted by the above wordmark on underground stations. Services operate on three main routes: from Hunts Cross in the south of Liverpool to via the &quot;Link&quot; tunnel from Brunswick station through central Liverpool, from Liverpool Central to , and from Liverpool Central to Headbolt lane via Kirkby. Each route operates a train every 15minutes from Monday to Saturday, giving a frequent interval between trains on the central section. Some additional trains run at peak hours on the Southport line.

On matchdays at Everton F.C.&#x27;s Goodison Park and Liverpool F.C.&#x27;s Anfield, Northern line services connect with the &quot;SoccerBus&quot; service at Sandhills station to transport fans to the stadia. Bus departures are at frequent intervals from Sandhills station with ticketing to combine both modes of travel. Kirkdale station is within walking distance of Goodison Park.

Connections to non-Merseyrail services are available at:
* to and ;
* Liverpool South Parkway for services operated by London Northwestern Railway, East Midlands Railway, TransPennine Express and Northern serving , , and various destinations within Yorkshire and the West Midlands;
* Hunts Cross to and ;
* Ormskirk to ;
* to Blackburn via Wigan Wallgate and .

===Wirral line===


The Wirral line is shown in green on the Merseyrail and Merseytravel maps and denoted by the above wordmark on underground stations. Services operate from the four terminus stations of: , , and . Each service from one of these the terminus stations runs through underground station in Birkenhead, then through the Mersey Railway Tunnel, continuing around the single track underground loop tunnel under Liverpool&#x27;s city centre. Trains head back into the Mersey Railway Tunnel to return to one of the four terminus stations.

Monday-Saturday services are every 15minutes to/from Liverpool to Chester, New Brighton and West Kirby, and every 30minutes to/from Ellesmere Port (Monday–Sunday). These combine to give a service at least every five minutes from Birkenhead Hamilton Square and around the loop under Liverpool&#x27;s city centre.

Connections to non-Merseyrail services are available at:
* on the West Kirby branch for the Borderlands line to Wrexham, operated by Transport for Wales;
* Chester to Crewe and London Euston, Wrexham and Shrewsbury, the North Wales Coast line to Llandudno and , and to Manchester either via Warrington or via Northwich and Knutsford;
* for an infrequent service to and from Warrington;
* Liverpool Lime Street for intercity and regional trains to London Euston, Manchester, Birmingham, Wigan, Scotland, the Midlands and Wales.

===City line===


The City line is the brand name used by Merseytravel on services out of the mainline platforms of Liverpool Lime Street railway station to 26 stations on its sponsored network, and cross-boundary destinations outside of the Liverpool City Region. Merseytravel has policies in place to improve the service frequency, new services and to invest on the City line. Despite the City line being operated by other train operators than Merseyrail, it is marketed and branded as &quot;Merseyrail&quot; to meet the passenger transport executive&#x27;s aims to provide the network with a local identity and shared fare and ticketing structures. The line is depicted on signage and maps using the colour red and the above word mark.

Unlike the Northern and Wirral lines, the City line is not operated by the Serco-Transport UK Group joint venture.

The City line covers the Liverpool City Region sections of the Crewe–Liverpool line, the two Liverpool–Manchester lines, and the Liverpool–Wigan line. Two services are not electrified, the Manchester via Warrington Central and Chester via Runcorn.

Northern mainly operate the City line with additional services operated by TransPennine Express, Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, Transport for Wales, and West Midlands Trains.

==History==

The &quot;History of Merseyrail&quot; dates back to the 19th century, with the original formation of the Mersey Railway and the Mersey Railway Tunnel, among the first underground railway tunnels. The modern Merseyrail network was developed in the 1970s from lines that were previously owned by several different railway companies. The Beeching axe during the early 1960s closed key routes in and around Liverpool, with the council proposing an alternate strategy and advocating the preservation of suburban services integrated into a new regional electrified rapid-transit network. The network underwent a period of electrification and expansion, becoming a single network in 1977, with a major project being the Loop and Link line, creating a continuous underground route through Liverpool city centre.

Over the years, several new stations such as in 1998 and in 2017 have been added to the network. Most recently in 2023, has opened and is served on the network by battery-electric trains. Various proposals have been suggested on how to further expand the network, including beyond the Liverpool City Region area. Liverpool City Region Combined Authority announced in August 2019 that it was planning to use part of a £172million funding package to reopen St James Station in Liverpool City Centre, officially confirmed as station following a public vote in April 2022.

==Services==
Point-to-point or return tickets are purchased from staffed offices or ticket machines, but the system is tightly integrated with Merseytravel&#x27;s City Region-wide pass system, which also encompasses the Mersey Ferries and city and regional bus networks. Merseytravel&#x27;s smart ticketing is via the local MetroCard smartcard system, including Merseyrail travel.

Typical weekday off-peak service on the Merseyrail-run Northern and Wirral lines, , is as follows:
==Fleet==
=== Class 777 ===
On 28 January 2020, rolling-stock manufacturer Stadler Rail provided the first of a new fleet of 53 new train sets, designated , built at its factory in Bussnang, Switzerland. The final units were due to enter service in 2021. The trains are based on the METRO platform, Stadler&#x27;s product family for underground trains also used on the Berlin U-Bahn, the Minsk Metro and the Tyne and Wear metro. The new trains are a custom-built, bespoke design specifically for the Merseyrail network, with driver only and guard capability. This differs from the previous fleet, which was built to a standard British Rail design for commuter services.

The new trains have an articulated four-car design, compared to the previous three-car units, with a significantly increased overall capacity and faster acceleration and deceleration, which gives reduced journey times. A combination of reduced weight of 99tonnes, representing a 5.5tonne weight reduction, and more efficient electrical systems will give a 20% reduction in energy use.

The trains are flexible, being capable of operating on a combination of any of , overhead wires, or full battery operation using a five-tonne battery, provided they have the correct equipment installed, giving operation beyond the current network. , all trains are only equipped for operation, along with a smaller battery for depot shunting.

The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers opposed driver-only operation on the new fleet, which they said would put passenger safety and security at risk. Following a period of strike action, an agreement was reached to guarantee a guard on every train.

Merseytravel has an option for a further 60 Class 777 units as part of the contract, which if exercised would see a total of 113 trains built if services are extended to new destinations such as Helsby, Skelmersdale or Wrexham. The deal also involves the transfer of 155 of Merseyrail&#x27;s maintenance workers and the operation of its maintenance depot at Kirkdale to Stadler Rail Service. The transfer of Kirkdale depot and Merseyrail engineering personnel took place in October 2017, as construction work to modernise the depot, which is the planned maintenance hub for the Class 777s, commenced.

The first Class 777 unit entered into service on the Northern line on 23 January 2023. Initially they were being used on the Kirkby route, followed by the Ormskirk route. The trains were introduced to the Wirral line, Ormskirk, Southport and Hunts Cross routes in late 2023.

=== Class 777 battery trains ===
The Class 777 trains are capable of being propelled via onboard battery sets. The battery set per car can be up to 5tonnes in weight. The batteries can be charged via a rail terminal charger and while operating on electrified tracks. When the Headbolt Lane extension was unveiled to the public, it was also announced that the original order of 52 units was increased to 53 to allow for some units to undergo battery trials.

Following on from the trial, it was announced in July 2021 that the units tested had been able to travel up to without the need for recharging. The battery-powered trains run to Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The technology opens up the possibility of the trains serving routes to destinations such as Wrexham, Preston, Wigan and Warrington.

=== Current fleet ===
===Past fleet===

The original service on the Merseyrail lines was provided by the Class 502 on the Northern line and Class 503 on the Wirral line. The former was withdrawn by 1980 and the latter by 1985.

Introduced from 1978 and 1979 respectively were 33 Class 507 and 43 Class 508 trains. Since the 1990s, fifteen Class 508s have been withdrawn as surplus and have later transferred to other operators with 12 units being transferred to Connex South Eastern and 3 units being transferred to Silverlink, with three Class 507 and 508 units, including unit 507006 after a crash at Kirkby in March 2021, written off following accidents. In 2022, further withdrawals of the trains began, having been replaced by Class 777s. In February 2024, the last of the Class 508s were withdrawn followed by the last Class 507 trains in November.

==Depots==

The electric fleet is maintained and stabled at Stadler&#x27;s maintenance depot and United Kingdom headquarters at Kirkdale and Birkenhead North TMD. Minor repair work and train cleaning is undertaken at Kirkdale, while overhauls are completed at Birkenhead. The roles will be reversed once the Class 777 trains fully replace the existing fleet. Other depots at Hall Road and Birkenhead Central were closed in 1997, and the former was demolished in April 2009. The Birkenhead Central depot is proposed for reopening.

There are also two depots near Southport station: Southport Wall Sidings and Southport Carriage Holding Sidings.

==Franchise and concession history==
As a result of the privatisation of British Rail, the Northern and Wirral lines were brought together as the Mersey Rail Electrics passenger franchise, being sold on 19 January 1997. Although franchises are awarded and administered on a national level (initially through various independent bodies, and later the Department of Transport directly), under the original privatisation legislation of 1993, passenger transport executives (PTEs) were co-signatories of franchise agreements covering their areas – this role being later modified by the Railways Act 2005.

The first train operating company awarded the Mersey Rail Electrics franchise contract was MTL. MTL was originally the operating arm of Merseytravel but had been privatised in 1985. The brand name Merseyrail Electrics was adopted by MTL.

The Merseyrail name became the official brand for the network in the days of British Rail, surviving several franchise holders, although the name was not used by Arriva when holding the franchise. Despite this, Merseytravel continued the Merseyrail branding at stations, allowing the name to be adopted colloquially. With acquisition by Arriva, the train operating company was rebranded Arriva Trains Merseyside from 27 April 2001. Merseyrail is referred to as &quot;Merseyrail Electrics&quot; by National Rail Enquiries, and as &quot;Serco/Abellio Merseyrail&quot; by Merseytravel.

The City line was also privatised under the 1993 Act, but as part of a different, much larger North West Regional Railways (NWRR) franchise. Upon sale on 2 March 1997, the first train operating company awarded the NWRR franchise contract was North Western Trains (owned by Great Western Holdings). The train operating company was later bought by FirstGroup and rebranded First North Western.

The third-rail electric Northern and Wirral lines were largely isolated from the rest of the National Rail network with no through passenger services to or from outside the third-rail Merseyrail network. A decision was to transfer the network into exclusive Merseytravel control, being removed from the national franchising system. The Secretary of State exempted the two lines from being designated as a national railway franchise under the 1993 Act.

When the Mersey Rail Electrics franchise was due for renewal, coming into force on 20 July 2003, Merseytravel contracted the operation of the two lines with a concession extending for up to 25years. The first successful bidder was Merseyrail Electrics (2002) Ltd, a joint venture between Serco and NedRailways (renamed Abellio in 2009).

The City line, which was largely diesel-operated at the time, was not included in 2003 franchise, continuing as a part of the nationally administered rail franchise system. From 11 December 2004, the NWRR franchise was merged into a new Northern franchise. The first train operating company awarded this franchise contract was Northern Rail, also owned by a Serco-NedRail (Abellio) joint venture. This franchise passed to Arriva Rail North on 1 April 2016 and then to Northern Trains on 1 March 2020.

Due to the isolation of the Northern and Wirral lines, Merseyrail Electrics (2002) Ltd are keen to adopt vertical integration – taking responsibility for maintenance of the track from Network Rail.

==Performance==

Operating as a self-contained network means there are relatively few problems because there is little conflict with other train operating companies. Merseyrail has publicly committed to aiming to be the best train operating company in the United Kingdom.

In February 2010, Merseyrail was named the most reliable operator of trains in the United Kingdom, with a reliability average of 96.33% during 2009–2010, the highest ever achieved by any United Kingdom train operator.

In 2023, Merseyrail was audited by the UK Government Office of Road &amp; Rail; it found poor performance with 26.2% of trains being delayed by 4 or more minutes and a cancellation rate of 2.2%, an increase of 1.1% on the previous year.

==Enforcement of by-laws==
Merseyrail employs a team of officers who enforce railway by-laws relating to placing feet on seats, travelling without tickets, and other kinds of anti-social behaviour. Merseyrail privately prosecutes individuals they claim are in breach of the by-laws via the single justice procedure.

The enforcement of the &#x27;feet on seat&#x27; by-law by Merseyrail was judged to be &quot;draconian&quot; in September 2007 by local magistrates. However, Merseyrail stated that it did not want to take offenders to court, but was not allowed to fine offenders otherwise (unlike people who smoke on trains or station platforms). Merseyrail claimed its stance was based on customer feedback and would reduce anti-social behaviour on the system.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 26 October 2005, a Merseyrail Class 508 train de-railed in a tunnel on the approach to Liverpool Central underground station. All 119 passengers and train crew were evacuated safely; only the guard was injured. The cause was determined to be rail gauge spread caused by poor maintenance.

On 11 January 2007, a train ran through a buffer stop at . Two people were injured.

On 30 June 2009, a train ran away at , running through a buffer stop and colliding with a wall. A passenger train had passed the site of the accident less than 5 seconds earlier. Merseyrail was fined £85,000 plus costs of £20,970.15 for offences under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.

On 22 October 2011, an intoxicated teenage girl died after falling between the train and platform at James Street station. The train guard, Christopher McGee, was subsequently convicted of her manslaughter by gross negligence and was jailed for five years.
On 13 March 2021, a Merseyrail Class 507 train collided with the buffer stop at station. The cause was found to be that the driver of the train was using a mobile phone whilst driving. The distraction led him to enter the station at nearly three times the permitted speed. He was sacked and prosecuted, pleading guilty in February 2022 to a charge of endangering the safety of people on the railway.

<doc id="327887" wikidata="Q2887785" url="?curid=327887" title="Russell Thaw">
<text>Russell William Thaw (October 25, 1910 – May 6, 1984) was an American airplane pilot and former childhood actor. While working as the chief pilot for the Guggenheim family, he was sponsored for air races and excursions. He served during World War II in the United States Army Air Force, and later became a test pilot for the Douglas Aircraft Company in California. In 1948 he was the first person to fly the Douglas XF3D-1.

Born in Germany to American parents, Thaw was the only child of Evelyn Nesbit, a Gibson Girl model and actress and her first husband Harry Kendall Thaw. Their lives had received sensational attention after his father fatally shot architect Stanford White in 1906 in front of a large crowd. Harry Thaw spent the next several years in mental institutions, before eventually being released. The Thaw family did not accept Nesbit&#x27;s claims about Russell&#x27;s paternity. He grew up in California, where his mother remarried after divorcing his father. She had a prominent and lucrative acting career and Thaw appeared as a child actor with his mother in six films of the silent film era, all of which have since been lost.

==Early years==

Born in Berlin, Germany in 1910, Thaw was the only known child of Evelyn Nesbit, a famous American model and actress, and her first legally binding husband Harry Kendall Thaw. The senior Thaw was wealthy, the son of a Pittsburgh railroad and coal tycoon, with a long history of mental instability. In 1906 at Madison Square Garden in front of hundreds of witnesses, he shot and killed architect Stanford White, who had drugged and raped Nesbit when she was 16 years old. In 1908 Harry Thaw was acquitted of murder based on reason of insanity, but he spent years in mental institutions, where Nesbit visited him.

Russell Thaw was treated indifferently by Harry Thaw and his family, who never accepted the boy as his biological son. Russell was born four years into a period of about seven years, following his father&#x27;s killing of White, when Harry Kendall Thaw was largely confined to jails and mental institutions. Nesbit had testified that Russell had been conceived by Harry Thaw during her conjugal visits to her husband at the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. There Harry Thaw had been given extensive visitation privileges, freedom of movement, and privacy. Nesbit said that those who saw the boy believed that Harry Thaw was his father due to the resemblance between them. She eventually gave up trying to prove Thaw&#x27;s paternity in an era before it could definitively be established. Nesbit said of the matter, &quot;A working girl could not fight the Thaw millions.&quot;

Nesbit and Harry Kendall Thaw divorced in 1915, after she had moved to California with Russell. She married again in 1916, to Jack Clifford. His father was eventually released, though a kidnapping and sexual assault charge saw him briefly confined again, before being released due to his family connections.

As a child, Thaw appeared with his mother in at least six films of the silent film era: &quot;Threads of Destiny&quot; (1914), &quot;Redemption&quot; (1917), &quot;Her Mistake&quot; (1918), &quot;The Woman Who Gave&quot; (1918), &quot;I Want to Forget&quot; (1918), and &quot;The Hidden Woman&quot; (1922). However, all copies of these films have since been lost.

==Career as a pilot==

As a young man Thaw was attracted to flying and became certified as a pilot. He worked as the chief pilot for the Guggenheim family and participated in air races and adventure excursions under their sponsorship.

Thaw participated in two cross-country Bendix trophy races. These were instituted in 1931 and held annually to promote and encourage the achievements of U.S. aviation. Flying the Gee Bee Model R-2 with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engine, he withdrew from the 1933 race. Flying a Northrop Gamma with a Wright Cyclone engine, he came in third in the 1935 race from Los Angeles to Cleveland, ahead of Amelia Earhart in fifth place.

On December 10, 1935, Thaw crashed in Atlanta, Georgia, after leaving from Caldwell, New Jersey, during a planned flight to rescue the polar explorer Lincoln Ellsworth.

He also served as a pilot in the US Army Air Force during World War II.

Thaw worked as a test pilot for the Douglas Aircraft Company. He flew the Douglas F3D Skyknight, the Douglas XB-43 Jetmaster, and the XF4D-1 Skyray. He was the first person to fly the Douglas XF3D-1 (on March 23, 1948, at Douglas&#x27;s El Segundo facility in California).

==Personal life==
On July 17, 1936, Thaw married Katherine Emily Roberts, a Beverly Hills debutante who was a graduate of Radcliffe College. They settled in White Plains, New York. They separated on March 15, 1939. Katherine Thaw sued her husband for cruelty and &quot;refusal to live with her&quot;. They divorced effective July 8, 1941. Katherine Thaw said that her husband had left her because he said he could not support them both.

Thaw married again in 1942. He and Barbara Hall had three children: sons Michael William and Russell Hall Thaw, and a daughter, Theresa Nesbit Thaw. Thaw died in Santa Barbara, California, on May 6, 1984.

<doc id="327892" wikidata="Q4353509" url="?curid=327892" title="Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)">
<text>James William Johnson (born July 16, 1943) is an American sports analyst and former football coach. Johnson served as a head football coach on the collegiate level from 1979 to 1988 and in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He is the first head football coach to win both a college football national championship and a Super Bowl, achieving the former with University of Miami and the latter with the Dallas Cowboys.

Johnson held his first head football coaching position at Oklahoma State University from 1979 to 1983. He became Miami&#x27;s head football coach in 1984 and guided the team to victory in the 1988 Orange Bowl. Following the college championship, Johnson succeeded original Cowboys head coach Tom Landry in 1989, a position that saw him help rebuild the team back to winning form. His tenure from 1989 to 1993 culminated with the Cowboys winning consecutive Super Bowl titles in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII. Johnson left Dallas after the second championship amid conflict with owner Jerry Jones.

Following two years away from football, Johnson returned in 1996 to become the head coach of the Miami Dolphins, where he served until retiring after the 1999 season. Since his coaching retirement, Johnson has appeared as an analyst for Fox Sports and is one of the featured commentators of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020, and the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2023.

==Early life==
Johnson attended high school at Thomas Jefferson High School, now Memorial High School, in Port Arthur, Texas. In high school he was a classmate of Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Janis Joplin.

Johnson played college football as a defensive lineman at the University of Arkansas between 1962 and 1964. He helped lead the Razorbacks to the national championship in 1964 when he was named to the All Southwest Conference team. Additionally, he was named to the Razorbacks’ All-Decade team of the 1960s, and was later inducted into Arkansas’ state athletic hall of fame in 1988, followed by the university&#x27;s hall of fame in 1999.

During his time in Arkansas, he played with future Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching jobs===
Johnson began as an assistant coach at Louisiana Tech University in 1965. During this time, Phil Robertson of &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; fame was the starting quarterback, and Johnson helped recruit high school quarterback Terry Bradshaw from nearby Shreveport. He then became an assistant coach at Picayune Memorial High School in Picayune, Mississippi, in 1966. In 1967, Johnson was an assistant at Wichita State University, then in 1968 and 1969, he served under Johnny Majors at Iowa State University in Ames. In 1970, Johnson moved on to another Big Eight Conference school, to become a defensive line coach at the University of Oklahoma, working under head coach Chuck Fairbanks and alongside future rivals Barry Switzer and Jim Dickey.

In 1973, Johnson returned to Arkansas, where he served as defensive coordinator through the 1976 season. There, he coached such players as Brison Manor and Dirt Winston. Johnson had hopes of being named head coach when Broyles retired, but was passed over for Lou Holtz. Holtz wanted to retain Johnson on his staff and offered him a position, but Jimmy decided to move on and amicably parted company with his alma mater.

Johnson became assistant head coach and defensive coordinator at the University of Pittsburgh under Jackie Sherrill in 1977 and 1978. There, he coached Randy Holloway, David Logan, Al Chesley, J. C. Wilson, Rickey Jackson, Jimbo Covert, and Hugh Green, and was introduced to Pitt alumnus and assistant coach Dave Wannstedt, who later teamed up with Johnson again at the University of Miami, Oklahoma State, the Cowboys, and the Dolphins.

===Oklahoma State===
In 1979, Johnson got his first head coaching job, at Oklahoma State University. Johnson coached for five seasons at Oklahoma State, from 1979 to 1983. His tenure there is noteworthy for his successful rebuilding of an inconsistent program. In his final season, he led the Cowboys to an 8–4 record and a 24–14 victory over 20th-ranked Baylor in the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl.

In 1984, when he was offered the head coaching job at the University of Miami, Johnson was unsure if he wanted to leave Stillwater. His good friend Larry Lacewell told Johnson that if he wanted to win a national championship and eventually coach in the NFL, he had to take the Miami job. Johnson soon after accepted the head coaching job at Miami.

Before taking the Miami job, Johnson interviewed for the head coaching job at Arkansas when Lou Holtz left following the 1983 season, then later found out that Ken Hatfield had already been hired. Upset that Frank Broyles (who by this time was the Arkansas athletic director) made no mention of this during the interview, Jimmy distanced himself from his alma mater. As payback for the snub, a home-and-home series was scheduled between Miami and Arkansas. In 1987, Miami gave Arkansas its worst home loss ever at the time, 51–7.

===University of Miami===
In 1984, Johnson was hired by the University of Miami to replace former coach Howard Schnellenberger, who had won Miami&#x27;s first national championship in 1983 and departed for the recently formed USFL. Johnson&#x27;s hiring was met with an initial response of &quot;Jimmy who?&quot; by the fans and media. Johnson started with a shaky 8–5 record his first season, which included a game in which Johnson&#x27;s Hurricanes blew a 31–0 halftime lead in a loss to Maryland with Frank Reich as its QB, and also included a 47–45 loss to Boston College immortalized by Doug Flutie&#x27;s &quot;Hail Mary&quot; touchdown pass on the game&#x27;s final play. But Johnson developed the Hurricanes into a football program that came to be known as &quot;the Decade of Dominance&quot;. In his five years at Miami, Johnson compiled a 52–9 record, appeared in five New Year&#x27;s Day bowl games, winning one national championship (1987) and losing one to the Penn State Nittany Lions (1986).

Johnson created a free-wheeling atmosphere where he allowed, and at times encouraged, his players to showboat, trash-talk, and run up the score. He also brought the modern 4–3 defense predicated on athletic upfield linemen to the forefront. The criticism they received from other teams caused the media to deem them the &quot;Bad Boys of College Football&quot;, a moniker Johnson openly accepted.

Johnson&#x27;s Hurricanes posted the school&#x27;s first undefeated regular season in 1986, only to lose the Fiesta Bowl and the national championship to #2-ranked Penn State. The loss, along with losses in Miami&#x27;s prior two bowl games, began to raise questions about whether Johnson was capable of winning major games. In the ensuing 1987 season, however, the Hurricanes went undefeated in the regular season yet again, and won the school&#x27;s second national title by defeating Barry Switzer&#x27;s Oklahoma Sooners for the third season in a row.

Johnson also created controversy by allowing the University of Miami to retire Vinny Testaverde&#x27;s football jersey number #14, but refusing to retire Bernie Kosar&#x27;s number #20, though Kosar played one season for Johnson and led the Hurricanes to the national title (the season before Johnson became head coach). Johnson&#x27;s reason for not retiring Kosar&#x27;s number was, &quot;Bernie didn&#x27;t finish the program here (at Miami).&quot; Kosar graduated with honors, a year ahead of his freshman class in 1985, with a dual major in finance and economics and subsequently entered the NFL&#x27;s supplemental draft. Testaverde won the school&#x27;s first Heisman Trophy award in December 1986 and was the first player selected in the 1987 NFL draft. However, as Cowboys&#x27; head coach, Johnson later reached out and signed Kosar as a backup QB after Kosar was released by the Cleveland Browns during the 1993 NFL season. Kosar played during the Cowboys&#x27; Super Bowl run that season while starter Troy Aikman was injured, clinching the NFC Championship game and earning a Super Bowl ring.

Johnson was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012.

===Dallas Cowboys===
In 1989, Jerry Jones, the new owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys, a long-time friend and former University of Arkansas teammate of Johnson&#x27;s, asked him to become the second head coach in franchise history, replacing Tom Landry, who had coached the team since its beginning in 1960. Johnson was reunited with former Miami standout Michael Irvin, and in Johnson&#x27;s first season as coach, the 1989 Cowboys went 1–15. Johnson, however, did not take long to develop the Cowboys into a championship-quality team. Johnson had an ability to find talent in the draft, make savvy trades (namely, the trade of Herschel Walker, which yielded six high draft picks and a number of players from the Minnesota Vikings), and by signing quality players such as Jay Novacek as free agents in the age before the NFL had imposed a salary cap.

Johnson served as head coach of the Cowboys from 1989 through 1993. He is one of only seven men in NFL history (including Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Chuck Noll, Mike Shanahan, Bill Belichick, and Andy Reid) to coach consecutive Super Bowl winners, winning Super Bowl XXVII in 1992 and Super Bowl XXVIII in 1993 (his team beat the Buffalo Bills in both Super Bowls). Johnson led the Cowboys to a record of 10–1 in the regular season during the month of December from 1991 to 1993, also leading to a playoff record of 7–1 in those years. Johnson also had a record of 24–1 when running back Emmitt Smith ran for 100 yards or more in a regular-season game, and 5–0 in the postseason, winning two Super Bowls.

Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones mutually agreed to split due largely to their growing inability to work together. Although Jones had the title of general manager, he had largely delegated control over on-field matters to Johnson. By 1993, however, Jones wanted more authority over the football side of the operation, but Johnson was unwilling to relinquish it. An incident happened in December 1993, when the Cowboys were getting ready to play the Giants for the NFC East title, where Johnson had said he was interested in becoming head coach of the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars. This led to Jones telling the media that he alone would decide Johnson&#x27;s coaching future. In March 1994, after the Cowboys had won their second Super Bowl under Johnson, Jones angered Johnson when he told reporters that any coach could have led the Cowboys to a Super Bowl. They agreed to part ways on March 28, 1994, with Johnson getting a $2 million bonus.

Jones then hired another former Arkansas player, former University of Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer, and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX two seasons after Johnson&#x27;s departure. Notable members on the winning team included Johnson holdovers Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, and Super Bowl XXX MVP Larry Brown. However, the Cowboys went into decline after Super Bowl XXX and have not reached the NFC Championship Game since then.

Johnson was not included on the Dallas Cowboys &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; for many years. Johnson and Jones had appeared to patch up their relationship, such as appearing together on the 25th anniversary of the Cowboys&#x27; Super Bowl XXVII win, and Johnson congratulating Jones on his Hall of Fame induction in 2017. When asked in the summer of 2014 why Johnson was not in the ring of honor despite his two Super Bowl victories as coach of the Cowboys, Jones stated: &quot;Disloyalty ... I couldn&#x27;t handle the disloyalty.&quot; The Cowboys Ring of Honor has been viewed as the &quot;gatekeeper to the Pro Football Hall of Fame&quot; for Dallas players, coaches, and executives; despite this snub, it was announced in 2020 that Johnson would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

On August 5, 2021, during the 2021 Hall of Fame Game broadcast on Fox, Jones announced that Johnson would be inducted in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor. The ceremony took place during the Cowboys&#x27; matchup against the Detroit Lions on December 30, 2023.

===Miami Dolphins===
After working as a television analyst with Fox Sports for two years and briefly flirting with an offer for the head-coaching job of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994, Johnson joined the Miami Dolphins in 1996, replacing head coach Don Shula, who retired at the end of the 1995 season. After a below-expectations year for the Dolphins in 1995, capped off by a blowout loss in the playoffs versus the Buffalo Bills, there was a groundswell among Dolphins fans who wanted Shula to step aside in favor of Johnson.

Johnson&#x27;s tenure in Miami did not live up to expectations. Johnson won fewer games in his first season than Shula had in his final season (8–8 vs. 9–7). Johnson&#x27;s overall winning percentage at Miami was 55.3% vs. 65.8% for Shula. Brian Billick related a story about Johnson in 2019 when each were broadcasters, with the latter stating his advice of how to not go back into coaching unless one had the passion and proper reasons to do so, since plenty of coaches went back without those reasons. As related by Billick of what Johnson said, “I was one of them. I went back for the wrong reasons. If you go back for ego, if you go back for money, it’s the wrong reason.&quot;

Johnson inherited one of the NFL&#x27;s best offenses, led by Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino; the defense was considered mediocre, though it was ranked 10th in fewest points allowed in 1995. As a defensive specialist, Johnson expected to put together a championship defense. With complete control over personnel decisions, Johnson and his staff signed several excellent defensive players, drafting future Hall of Famers Jason Taylor and Zach Thomas, and Pro Bowlers Sam Madison, and Patrick Surtain. But Johnson&#x27;s brilliant draft record was blemished by several disappointments, including fifth-round pick running back Cecil Collins, and two first-round picks, running back John Avery and wide receiver Yatil Green. The Dolphins finished 8–8 in 1996 and then 9–7 in 1997, losing to the New England Patriots in the wild card round. In 1998, the Dolphins finished 10–6 with the league&#x27;s best defense, defeated the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round, then were crushed 38–3 by the Denver Broncos in the divisional round.

In a 1996 interview, Johnson said he did not feel he could ever reach the stature of Shula or Landry, simply because he did not feel able to stay with the job as long as they had: &quot;26 years or so as a head coach. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll make it that long. This is my sixth year as a head coach, and whenever this contract&#x27;s done, I think I&#x27;ll probably be done coaching.&quot;

In January 1999, Johnson resigned as Dolphins head coach, citing burnout. He reversed his decision in one day, after Marino—with whom Johnson had a strained relationship—pleaded with Johnson to come back. Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga also hired the recently fired Chicago Bears head coach Dave Wannstedt, a former assistant under Johnson both at the University of Miami and at Dallas, as defensive coordinator/assistant head coach.

In the face of Super Bowl expectations, the Dolphins went out and won four of their first five games, with the loss to Buffalo on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; leaving Johnson to criticize Marino publicly for his play. Marino suffered a bone spur in his back that knocked him out until Thanksgiving, leaving the team in the hands of rookie Damon Huard. By the halfway point, the Dolphins were 7–1, with Huard losing only once as a starter. When Marino returned with the team at 8–2, he threw five interceptions against Dallas in what became a harbinger for the rest of the stretch, which saw Miami lose five of their last six games on their way to a 9–7 record while the relationship between Marino and Johnson saw the latter described as &quot;vaguely critical&quot; of the former in public. Due to a loss by Kansas City, Miami made it to the playoffs and faced the Seattle Seahawks in the wild card round of the playoffs. Playing in Seattle, the Dolphins rallied late 20–17 to win their first road playoff game since 1972. However, in the divisional round, they were crushed in an embarrassing 62–7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars where they trailed by 41 at halftime. Johnson resigned the day after the game and Marino soon thereafter announced his retirement. Johnson was succeeded by Wannstedt.

In a 2021 interview, Johnson revealed that the Dolphins could have traded for Peyton Manning in the 1998 NFL draft, theoretically offering the Colts their entire draft board in exchange for the first overall pick. Johnson declined to give more details to this trade, with him stating, &quot;I probably gave you too much already.&quot; Johnson stated later that one of his biggest disappointments was not having a &quot;healthy Dan Marino&quot;, as Marino had ailing knees and a previously torn Achilles to go with a bad shoulder in their final season together.

==Television career==

After leaving the Dolphins, Johnson became a TV studio analyst again for Fox Sports and is currently an on-air staff member on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;. He has been assigned as a studio analyst for Fox&#x27;s coverage of the Bowl Championship Series in January with Chris Rose as the host, and also pens a column on Foxsports.com. In addition he has made several guest or cameo appearances in film and television: as a bearded prisoner in lockup on the television series &quot;The Shield&quot;, as a guest star in the episode, &quot;Johnsonwreckers&quot; on &quot;Coach&quot; in 1994, and a cameo in the movie &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, next to Bill Cowher.

===Commercials===
Johnson endorsements include Procter &amp; Gamble, and a series of commercials for the male enhancement pill ExtenZe in 2010. He was also involved in a South Florida-based scam called The Leading Edge that purported to feature businesses on an &quot;educational&quot; &quot;interstitial&quot; program by that name that would air on public television. Johnson filmed the TV spots, in the style of an infomercial, and businesses were pitched on the program using these clips, which appeared on the website. They were charged an &quot;underwriting fee&quot; of over $20,000 to appear on the show, however, the show never actually would then air. They were not affiliated with PBS and there is no record of any air dates.

===&quot;Survivor&quot;===
Johnson was one of 20 castaways competing in &quot;&quot;, the 21st edition of &quot;Survivor&quot;, in late 2010. He is a long-time fan of the show, and had been cast for &quot;&quot;, which was the 17th edition of the show, but had to withdraw after failing a physical. Johnson, the oldest contestant of the season, was part of the Espada tribe, made up entirely of people aged 40 and older. He was voted out 8–1 on Day Eight of the competition, becoming the third person voted out of the game and finishing 18th overall. As he left the game, he said to his tribe, &quot;One of you, win a million bucks, okay?&quot; However, the season was won by a member of the opposing La Flor tribe. He also said, &quot;I had fun, but I was miserable the whole time. I still love the game, it&#x27;s been a great adventure, but this is the most stressful time I&#x27;ve ever gone through in my life. And that includes Super Bowls and collegiate national championships. I initially said, &#x27;Keep your strongest members.&#x27; I obviously wasn&#x27;t one of them.&quot;

==Pro Football Hall of Fame Induction==
Johnson was surprised during a telecast of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; by Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker on January 12, 2020, announcing that he would be the 328th member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He personally thanked his coworkers on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, and thanked his players and assistant coaches for their contributions. Following numerous delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson was formally inducted on August 7, 2021.

<doc id="327893" wikidata="Q413918" url="?curid=327893" title="Isoflurane">
<text>Isoflurane, sold under the brand name Forane among others, is a general anesthetic. It can be used to start or maintain anesthesia; however, other medications are often used to start anesthesia, due to airway irritation with isoflurane. Isoflurane is given via inhalation.
Side effects of isoflurane include a decreased ability to breathe (respiratory depression), low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat. Serious side effects can include malignant hyperthermia or high blood potassium. It should not be used in patients with a history of malignant hyperthermia in either themselves or their family members. It is unknown if its use during pregnancy is safe for the fetus, but use during a cesarean section appears to be safe. Isoflurane is a halogenated ether.
Isoflurane was approved for medical use in the United States in 1979. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Isoflurane is always administered in conjunction with air or pure oxygen. Often, nitrous oxide is also used. Although its physical properties imply that anaesthesia can be induced more rapidly than with halothane, its pungency can irritate the respiratory system, negating any possible advantage conferred by its physical properties. Thus, it is mostly used in general anesthesia as a maintenance agent after induction of general anesthesia with an intravenous agent such as thiopentone or propofol.

==Mechanism of action==
Similar to many general anesthetics, the exact mechanism of the action has not been clearly delineated. Isoflurane reduces pain sensitivity (analgesia) and relaxes muscles. Isoflurane likely binds to GABA, glutamate and glycine receptors, but has different effects on each receptor. Isoflurane acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor in electrophysiology studies of neurons and recombinant receptors. It potentiates glycine receptor activity, which decreases motor function. It inhibits receptor activity in the NMDA glutamate receptor subtypes. Isoflurane inhibits conduction in activated potassium channels. Isoflurane also affects intracellular molecules. It inhibits plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs) which affects membrane fluidity by hindering the flow of Ca2+ (calcium ions) out across the membrane, this in turn affects neuron depolarization. It binds to the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase.

General anaesthesia with isoflurane reduces plasma endocannabinoid AEA concentrations, and this could be a consequence of stress reduction after loss of consciousness.

==Adverse effects==

Isoflurane can cause a sudden decrease in blood pressure due to dose-dependent peripheral vasodilation. This may be specially marked in hypovolemic patients.

Animal studies have raised safety concerns of certain general anesthetics, in particular ketamine and isoflurane, in young children. The risk of neurodegeneration was increased in combination of these agents with nitrous oxide and benzodiazepines such as midazolam. Whether these concerns occur in humans is unclear.

===Elderly===
Biophysical studies using NMR spectroscopy has provided molecular details of how inhaled anesthetics interact with three amino acid residues (G29, A30 and I31) of amyloid beta peptide and induce aggregation. This area is important as &quot;some of the commonly used inhaled anesthetics may cause brain damage that accelerates the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot;.

==Physical properties==
It is administered as a racemic mixture of (&quot;R&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;)-optical isomers. Isoflurane has a boiling point of . It is non-combustible but can give off irritable and toxic fumes when exposed to flame.

==History==
Together with enflurane and halothane, Isoflurane began to replace the flammable ethers used in the pioneer days of surgery; this shift began in the 1940s to the 1950s. Its name comes from being a structural isomer of enflurane, hence they have the same empirical formula.

==Environment==
The average lifetime of isoflurane in the atmosphere is 3.2 years, its global warming potential is 510 and the yearly emissions add up to 880 tons.

== Veterinary use ==
Isoflurane is frequently used for veterinary anaesthesia.

<doc id="327896" wikidata="Q419394" url="?curid=327896" title="Sevoflurane">
<text>Sevoflurane, sold under the brand name Sevorane, among others, is a sweet-smelling, nonflammable, highly fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether used as an inhalational anaesthetic for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. After desflurane, it is the volatile anesthetic with the fastest onset. While its offset may be faster than agents other than desflurane in a few circumstances, its offset is more often similar to that of the much older agent isoflurane. While sevoflurane is only half as soluble as isoflurane in blood, the tissue blood partition coefficients of isoflurane and sevoflurane are quite similar. For example, in the muscle group: isoflurane 2.62 vs. sevoflurane 2.57. In the fat group: isoflurane 52 vs. sevoflurane 50. As a result, the longer the case, the more similar will be the emergence times for sevoflurane and isoflurane.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
It is one of the most commonly used volatile anesthetic agents, particularly for outpatient anesthesia, across all ages, but particularly in pediatric anesthesia, as well as in veterinary medicine. Together with desflurane, sevoflurane is replacing isoflurane and halothane in modern anesthesia practice. It is often administered in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen.

==Physiological effects==
Sevoflurane is a potent vasodilator. As such, it induces a dose dependent reduction in blood pressure and cardiac output. It is a bronchodilator, however, in patients with pre-existing lung pathology, it may precipitate coughing and laryngospasm. It reduces the ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, and impedes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Sevoflurane vasodilatory properties also cause it to increase intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow. However, it reduces cerebral metabolic rate.

==Adverse effects==
Sevoflurane has an excellent safety record, but is under review for potential hepatotoxicity, and may accelerate Alzheimer&#x27;s. There were rare reports involving adults with symptoms similar to halothane hepatotoxicity. Sevoflurane is the preferred agent for mask induction due to its lesser irritation to mucous membranes.

Sevoflurane is an inhaled anesthetic that is often used to induce and maintain anesthesia in children for surgery. During the process of awakening from the medication, it has been associated with a high incidence (&gt;30%) of agitation and delirium in preschool children undergoing minor noninvasive surgery. It is not clear if this can be prevented.

Studies examining a current significant health concern, anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (including with sevoflurane, and especially with children and infants) are &quot;fraught with confounders, and many are underpowered statistically&quot;, and so are argued to need &quot;further data... to either support or refute the potential connection&quot;.

Concern regarding the safety of anaesthesia is especially acute with regard to children and infants, where preclinical evidence from relevant animal models suggest that common clinically important agents, including sevoflurane, may be neurotoxic to the developing brain, and so cause neurobehavioural abnormalities in the long term; two large-scale clinical studies (PANDA and GAS) were ongoing as of 2010, in hope of supplying &quot;significant [further] information&quot; on neurodevelopmental effects of general anaesthesia in infants and young children, including where sevoflurane is used.

In 2021, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published in Communications Biology research that sevoflurane may accelerate existing Alzheimer&#x27;s or existing tau protein to spread: &quot;These data demonstrate anesthesia-associated tau spreading and its consequences. [...] This tau spreading could be prevented by inhibitors of tau phosphorylation or extracellular vesicle generation.&quot; According to Neuroscience News, &quot;Their previous work showed that sevoflurane can cause a change (specifically, phosphorylation, or the addition of phosphate) to tau that leads to cognitive impairment in mice. Other researchers have also found that sevoflurane and certain other anesthetics may affect cognitive function.&quot;

Additionally, there has been some investigation into potential correlation of sevoflurane use and renal damage (nephrotoxicity). However, this should be subject to further investigation, as a recent study shows no correlation between sevoflurane use and renal damage as compared to other control anesthetic agents. There is also evidence that renal damage may be caused by compound A, a product of the degradation of sevoflurane.

==Pharmacology==
The exact mechanism of the action of general anaesthetics has not been delineated. Sevoflurane acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor in electrophysiology studies of neurons and recombinant receptors. However, it also acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, potentiates glycine receptor currents, and inhibits nAChR and 5-HT3 receptor currents.

==History==
Sevoflurane was discovered by Ross Terrell alongside Louise Speers. Sevoflurane was concurrently synthesized by Richard Wallen. The rights for sevoflurane worldwide were held by AbbVie. It is available as a generic drug.

==Global-warming potential==
Sevoflurane is a greenhouse gas. The twenty-year global-warming potential, GWP(20), for sevoflurane is 349, however this is significantly lower than isoflurane or desflurane.

== Degradation ==
Sevoflurane will degrade into what is most commonly referred to as compound A (fluoromethyl 2,2-difluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl)vinyl ether) when in contact with CO2 absorbents, and this degradation tends to enhance with decreased fresh gas flow rates, increased temperatures, and increased sevoflurane concentration. Compound A may be correlated with renal damage.

<text>Jaclyn Michelle Linetsky (January 8, 1986 – September 8, 2003) was a Canadian actress who played the title character on &quot;Caillou&quot; and Megan O&#x27;Connor on &quot;15/Love&quot;.

== Early life ==
Jaclyn Michelle Linetsky was born on January 8, 1986, at the Jewish General Hospital to Jewish parents, Terry (née Weiner) and Larry Linetsky. She had two older siblings, Kelly and Derek. Linetsky was raised in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, then moved to Hampstead, a suburb in Montreal, Quebec. She graduated from St. George&#x27;s School of Montreal in 2003, and she gave a speech at the graduation ceremony.

== Career ==
Linetsky began acting at age eight, performing in theatre productions. Her first major gig was in a milk radio advertisement at age 10.

Linetsky provided the voice of the title character in the animated series &quot;Caillou&quot; from 2000 until her death in 2003. She also provided the voices for Bitzi in the animated series &quot;Daft Planet&quot; (2002); Lori Mackney in the second season of &quot;What&#x27;s with Andy?&quot; (2003–2004) replacing US voice actress Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey; Kit on &quot;Kit &amp; Kaboodle&quot;. Shei-Hu, his cousin Shei-He, and a large group of other mice as well as additional voices on &quot;Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat&quot;; Yukari on &quot;Tommy &amp; Oscar&quot;; Brenda on &quot;Rotten Ralph&quot; and Meg in &quot;Mega Babies&quot;.

Other roles in voice acting included, &quot;The Kids from Room 402&quot;, &quot;Wunschpunsch&quot;, &quot;The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures&quot;, &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings&quot;, &quot;Jim Button&quot; and video games &quot;Alex Builds His Farm&quot; and &quot;Evolution Worlds&quot;.

In 2003, Linetsky was cast in the tennis-circuit-themed dramatic series &quot;15/Love&quot; on YTV. Her character, Megan O&#x27;Connor, was falling in love with Sebastian Dube, played by co-star Vadim Schneider.

== Death ==
On September 8, 2003, Linetsky and Vadim Schneider were on their way to the set of &quot;15/Love&quot; in Saint-Césaire, Quebec, in a Dodge Caravan. For unknown reasons, the Dodge Caravan went off its original trajectory around 12:15 P.M., and across the middle band of the highway, finishing in the wrong direction on Highway 10 West in Brossard. The van swerved into oncoming traffic, crossed the median, and struck a 20-foot semi-truck head on, causing the vehicle to burst into flames. Both actors were knocked unconscious by the impact.

Schneider died instantly on impact from multiple physical trauma while Linetsky went into cardiac arrest and died hours later from the combined effects of physical trauma, severe injuries, and burns. They were both 17 years old.

On the day of Schneider and Linetsky&#x27;s deaths, filming for &quot;15/Love&quot; was cancelled and the crew put the show on a two-week hiatus, citing a desire to speak with their families before determining what to do with their characters.

On September 10, 2003, a funeral was held for Linetsky, with over 1,500 mourners in attendance. She was buried in Kehal Israel Memorial Park in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec.

Linetsky was replaced by Annie Bovaird as the voice of Caillou. She was also replaced by Eleanor Noble as the voice of Lori Mackney in What’s with Andy? and her and Schneider’s characters in 15/Love were written to have died in a plane crash off-screen.

In a statement, Stuart Snyder, President and CEO of Cinar Corporation, wrote:

== Tributes ==
The episode of &quot;What&#x27;s with Andy?&quot; entitled &quot;Nurse Jen&quot; was dedicated to her memory, as was the &quot;15/Love&quot; episode entitled &quot;Curveballs P.1&quot; and the &quot;Caillou&quot; film &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot;. The very last episode of &quot;15/Love&quot; was also dedicated to her memory. In 2009, St. George&#x27;s School of Montreal, Linetsky&#x27;s alma mater, renamed their performing arts program &quot;The Jaclyn Linetsky Performing Arts Program&quot; in her honour.

<text>John Leonard Hines (21 May 1868 – 13 October 1968) was an American general who served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1924 to 1926.

==Early career==
Hines was born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, to Irish parents, Edward and Mary. Having won a competitive examination for a congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, Hines, despite having a hard time maintaining his passing grades, nevertheless graduated and was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry on 12 June 1891. While he was there he took an interest in athletics, becoming a member of one of the first football teams at West Point.

His first assignment upon his graduation was to the 2nd Infantry Regiment at Fort Omaha, Nebraska. Hines served with the regiment in Nebraska and later at Fort Harrison, Montana, from 1891 to 1898, where he married Harriet Schofield &quot;Rita&quot; Wherry, one of the daughters of Brigadier General William M. Wherry and Alice Grammer.

Hines served with the 25th Infantry Regiment in Cuba during the Spanish–American War and in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. In 1898 he was elected as a Veteran Companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. He was adjutant of the Mexican Punitive Expedition in 1916–17 under General John J. Pershing.

==World War I==
During World War I, Hines rose rapidly in rank as he was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel in May 1917, then to colonel (November 1917), brigadier general (April 1918), and, in August 1918, to temporary major general—four grades in 16 months. He assumed successively larger commands—from regiment to brigade, division, and finally, corps.

Hines commanded the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, from May to August 1918, during which time he received the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest decoration for valor in the United States Armed Forces, with the medal&#x27;s citation reading:

On 16 August 1918, Hines assumed command of the 4th Division. He commanded the division during the American operations at St. Mihiel and in the Meuse-Argonne until 11 October 1918. Hines then took command of III Corps, leading it during the final engagements of the war and the occupation of the Rhineland. For his service during the war he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which reads:

==Post war==
Hines was promoted to permanent major general in March 1921. His post-war commands included the 5th Division, the 2nd Division and the VIII Corps Area.


In December 1922, Hines was assigned as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, and became Chief of Staff of the United States Army on 14 September 1924. His army biography states that as chief of staff, he &quot;stressed the need for balance in funding and personnel for all parts of the permanent establishment, pointed up the effects of strength deficiencies upon Army capability to meet the provisions of the National Defense Act of 1920, and urged action on housing and promotions to promote personnel retention.&quot;

On 7 May 1925, Hines dedicated the landing field at the Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington, to the memory of Lieutenant Alexander Pearson Jr., who was killed on September 2, 1924, in Fairfield, Ohio while flying the Curtiss R-8 in preparation for the upcoming Pulitzer Trophy Race.

In 1926, after completing his tour as Army Chief of Staff, Hines took command of the IX Corps Area in California, which he led until 1930. In 1930, Hines became commanding general of the Philippine Department.

==Retirement==
Hines retired in May 1932. He was promoted to the rank of full (4 star) general on the retired list by a Special Act of Congress on 15 June 1940.

Hines died in Washington, D.C., at Walter Reed Army Medical Center at age 100. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Family and legacy==
On 5 May 2000, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;Distinguished Soldiers&quot; stamps in which Hines was honored.

Hines&#x27; son, Colonel John L. Hines Jr. (1905–1986), served in World War II with the 6th Armored Division, commanding the division&#x27;s Combat Command A from November 1944 to March 1945. He was twice decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross and was severely wounded outside Frankfurt, Germany when an 88 mm antitank shell grazed his face.

<text>John Ellis Wool (February 20, 1784 – November 10, 1869) was a US officer in the United States Army during three consecutive American-involved wars: the War of 1812 (1812–1815), the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), and with allegiance to the Union, in the American Civil War (1861–1865). He also participated in the American Indian Wars and the Trail of Tears, that resulted in Indian tribes being forcefully marched westward in the 1830s from the Southeast US beyond the Mississippi River into the newly established Indian Territory (The modern state of Oklahoma). By the 1840s, he was widely considered one of the most capable officers in the United States Army and an Excellent organizer.

He was one of the five highest general officers (along with Winfield Scott, David E. Twiggs, William S. Harney, and Joseph E. Johnston) of the United States Army on the eve of the American Civil War in 1861, and was the one who had the most seniority of service. When the Civil War began on April 12, 1861, General Wool, then aged 77 and ranked as a brigadier general for the past 20 peace-time years, commanded the Department of the East. He was the oldest general on either side of the ensuing Civil War.

==Early life and education==
John Ellis Wool was born in Newburgh, New York. When he was orphaned at a young age, he went to live with his grandfather, James Wool, in Troy, New York. He attended a local school and, at the age of twelve, began working at a store in Troy. He later read the law with an established firm in order to learn and be admitted to the bar. His family was of Dutch descent.

==War of 1812==
At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Wool was a practicing attorney in Troy, New York.

===Battle of Queenston Heights===
When he volunteered at the age of 28, he was commissioned as a captain in the 13th United States Infantry Regiment on April 14, 1812. He fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812, where he was shot through his thighs.

During the battle, Wool led a commando-like strike team of 60 men through unguarded terrain hidden in the thicket of maple trees that successfully surprised and captured the enemy cannon, but the cannon was spiked by the British before being captured. On the heights above the British and Canadians, the Americans fanned out. The Americans hid among the trees and foliage, and continued firing their muskets at the British and Canadians as they crested the hill. British commander Isaac Brock charged in the open with his men against the sheltered Americans but was shot and killed by an American marksman hidden behind a tree. Another British commander John Macdonell also died leading a charge against sheltered concealed Americans. Even though the Americans held a superior position, their morale was low, they were intimidated by the Native American Allies of the British whom they greatly feared, and had weak leadership. Eventually the Americans lost the battle.

===Battle of Plattsburgh===
After recovering from his wound, Wool was promoted major of the 29th United States Infantry Regiment on April 13, 1813, which he led with distinction at the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. On September 6, 1814, the British arrived with a large army. The British encountered the Americans and both sides exchanged heavy fire. A British Colonel Wellington who was a nephew of Lord Wellington was killed. John E. Wool and his 250 regulars fell back in front of the British column, finding cover behind the fences and trees of the roadway. The Americans lay behind stone fences and secreted themselves in the wood until the British arrived within gunshot, and would then fire upon the British and retire a half mile; in this manner the Americans fought the British column for six miles until the British main force arrived and the Americans were compelled to give up half the town.

At Halsey&#x27;s corner, near the Platt farm on the Beekmantown road, American regulars accompanying the artillery masked their three cannons in the middle of the roadway behind a stone wall. The American regulars positioned themselves behind the stone wall with Aiken&#x27;s teenage volunteers. The American artillery behind the wall fired three times as the regulars and volunteers behind the stone wall fired their rifles, mowing down the British in great numbers. Four British officers were killed and 100 British privates killed or wounded. American casualties did not exceed 25. The American regulars followed their militia in retreat across the Saranac River. John E. Wool formed his men on the other side and demolished the bridge.

John E. Wool and his fellow American forces held out until the British suffered major setbacks such as losing the naval engagement against the U.S. Navy, getting lost in a maze of camouflaged roadways laid by the Americans, and constantly facing harassing fire from the American militia from behind trees, rocks, and bushes. The British admitted defeat and withdrew from the battlefield making the Americans victors.

After the battle, he was a major of the 6th United States Infantry as of May 17, 1815. As this war was coming to an end, John Ellis Wool was promoted to the rank of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel on September 11, 1814.

==Staying on with the U.S. Army==
An orphan with little formal education, Wool remained in the military service and was promoted to colonel and Inspector General of the Army on April 29, 1816. He was sent to Europe in 1832 to observe foreign military organizations and operations. He also participated in the removal of the Cherokee from Georgia and Tennessee in the 1830s. As part of this effort, he established Fort Butler at present-day Murphy, North Carolina, as the eastern headquarters of the military removal of the Cherokee. In 1841, Wool was promoted to brigadier general in the U.S. Army and years later in 1847 made commander of the Department of the East.

==Mexican–American War and Oregon==
He was assigned command of the Center Division and led the Chihuahuan Expedition, which resulted in the capture of Saltillo. After leading his troops 900 miles from San Antonio, Texas, he joined General Zachary Taylor at the Battle of Buena Vista. Wool&#x27;s leadership was recognized with a Congressional sword, a vote of thanks, and the brevet of major general. After the battle, he commanded the occupation forces of northern Mexico.

He commanded both the Department of the East and the Department of the Pacific after of the war. The first he would command in 1847–1854 and again in 1857–1860; the second he would command in 1854–1857. While in the East, on August 15, 1848, General Wool laid the cornerstone for the city hospital at Troy, (which later became known as St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital).

While in charge of the U.S. Army Department of the Pacific, General Wool contributed extensively to the settling of the Indian Wars in Oregon, especially the Rogue River Indian War. He came into the conflict late, after the Oregon territorial government was formed and the Volunteer Militias had committed many acts of genocide against the tribes in southwestern Oregon Territory (including present-day Washington). Based in California, General Wool wrote to local papers with his opinions of the Oregon situation. Generally he defended the Indian tribes and condemned the acts of the militias. The federal government decided to undertake Indian removal to reservations in order to allow their lands to be taken by the settlers, and Wool was to carry it out. Wool wrote to the Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens about the conflicts:


==Civil War==
When the Civil War began in April 1861, Wool had just turned 77 years old, two years older than commander-in-chief of the US Army Winfield Scott. Unlike Scott, who suffered from obesity, gout, and other ailments, Wool was still reasonably fit and could mount a horse.

Thus in August 1861, John Ellis Wool was named commander of the U.S. Army Department of Virginia, an office that he would hold until June 1862. He moved to equip some of the first regiments sent from New York to the nation&#x27;s capital and his quick and decisive moves secured Fort Monroe, Virginia, for the Union when other military installations in the South were falling to Confederate forces. The fort guarded the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay and the James River, overlooking Hampton Roads and the Gosport Navy Yard, which the Confederates had seized. It was to serve as the principal supply depot of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign. The septuagenarian Wool thought McClellan was not aggressive enough in his push towards Richmond and in May 1862, he sent troops to occupy the Navy yard, Norfolk, and the surrounding towns after the Confederates abandoned them. The 16th U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln personally witnessed the capture of Norfolk and afterwards rewarded Wool by promoting him to a full major general in the regular army thereby becoming only the 23rd man to hold this rank since its creation in 1791.

Deciding that Wool should have a less demanding assignment at his advanced age, the president transferred him to be the 2nd Commander of the Middle Department in June 1862, which then became the VIII Corps on July 22, 1862. J.E. Wool then served as the 1st Commander of the U.S. Army 8th Corps until December 22, 1862. On January 3, 1863, he again assumed command of the Department of the East where he served until July 18, 1863.

But eventually Wool managed to find his way back into action. After the Battle of Gettysburg, he led troops diverted from that region in military operations to regain control in New York City during and after the draft riots in July of that year. US troops reached the city after rioters had already destroyed numerous buildings, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, which they burned to the ground. Despite the tiny force he had on hand, Wool managed to contain the situation until reinforcements arrived. Thus during July 13–17 of 1863, Wool was the de facto Military Commander of New York City.

On August 1, President Lincoln sent an order retiring Wool from service after 51 years in the Army. At the age of 79, he was the oldest general officer to execute active command in either army during the war.

==Retirement and death==
Wool, who believed he was still healthy and fit enough for duty, was stunned and outraged at his dismissal and wrote a series of letters to the War Department in protest, but to no avail. He continued sending letters for the remaining few years of his life to the then President Andrew Johnson and Ulysses Grant, again without effect.

Wool lived in Troy, New York for the remaining five years of his life. He died on November 10, 1869. He was buried there in Oakwood Cemetery. An obelisk was erected as a monument to Wool at the cemetery.

<doc id="327911" wikidata="Q1380819" url="?curid=327911" title="Tony Dorsett">
<text>Anthony Drew Dorsett Sr. (born April 7, 1954) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Denver Broncos.

Raised in western Pennsylvania, Dorsett played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers, where he led the Panthers to the national championship as a senior in the 1976 season and won the Heisman Trophy. He was the first-round, second overall draft choice of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1977 NFL draft. Dorsett was the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and played for the team for 11 seasons, through 1987. He won a Super Bowl title in his rookie season over the Denver Broncos, with whom he spent his final season before retiring due to injuries. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1994) and the College Football Hall of Fame (1994).

==Early life==
The son of Wes and Myrtle, Dorsett grew up in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, northwest of Pittsburgh. He attended Hopewell High School, where he played football and basketball.

As a high school sophomore in 1970, Dorsett started at cornerback, as his coaches did not believe the 147-pound Dorsett was big enough to play running back, the position he played in junior high school. In 1971, a competition between Dorsett and sophomore Michael Kimbrough for the starting running back position ended after Dorsett took a screen pass 75 yards for a touchdown against Ambridge during the season opener.

Dorsett ended the year as an All-State selection after rushing for 1,034 yards and scoring 19 touchdowns, while leading the Vikings to a 9–1 season. He also remained a starting cornerback on the defensive side. In basketball Dorsett helped his team reach the WPIAL quarterfinals.

In 1972, Dorsett was again an All-state Selection, after setting a single-game rushing record with 247 yards against Sharon, a single-season rushing record with 1,238 yards and the career rushing record with 2,272 yards, while leading the Vikings to a 9–1 season. Dorsett was also a key player on the defensive side as one of the starting linebackers.

For all the ability he had, Dorsett could never lead his team to the WPIAL Class AA playoffs, because in those days the teams had to have an undefeated record. The team&#x27;s only loss in 1971 came against Sharon after Dorsett experienced a concussion and played less than a quarter, and the only loss in 1972 came against Butler while playing on a muddy field.

At the end of his senior season, he played at the Big 33 Football Classic. This was the first time that his future coach Johnny Majors saw him play live.

Later, the school retired his 33 jersey. In 2001, Hopewell&#x27;s Stadium was renamed Tony Dorsett Stadium.

==College career==
The NCAA had granted freshmen permission to play varsity football in 1972, and in 1973 at the University of Pittsburgh, Dorsett became the first freshman in 29 years to be named All-American. Doc Blanchard of Army was the previous one in 1944, the freshmen restriction having been temporarily suspended during World War II. Dorsett finished second in the nation in rushing with 1,586 yards in 11 games and led the Pittsburgh Panthers to its first winning season in 10 years. He was Pittsburgh&#x27;s first All-American selection since the 1963 season, when both Paul Martha and Ernie Borghetti were named to the first team. His 1,586 rushing yards at the time was the most ever recorded by a freshman, breaking the record set by New Mexico State&#x27;s Ron &quot;Po&quot; James record in 1968. James, like Dorsett, hailed from Beaver County, Pennsylvania, specifically New Brighton. Although Dorsett was known as Anthony, the school&#x27;s athletic department convinced him to go by Tony, to use the marketable initials TD as in touchdown.

At the beginning of Dorsett&#x27;s freshman year at Pitt, his son Anthony Dorsett was born on September 14, 1973. Later in the 1973 season, Dorsett faced some criticism when it became known that his son was born out of wedlock, with some observers contending that he should drop out of school and marry his son&#x27;s mother and financially support his family. Dorsett believed that the best way to care for his son was to continue to pursue his football career, a tactic that succeeded due to his successful professional career.

Three games into his sophomore season, he became Pitt&#x27;s all-time leader in career rushing yards, surpassing the old record of 1,957 yards set by Marshall Goldberg, who helped Pitt to a national championship in 1937.

Against Notre Dame in his junior year, Dorsett had 303 yards rushing to break his own school single-game rushing record. As a senior in 1976, he had a total of 290 yards against Notre Dame. He darted 61 yards on his first run of the season and tacked on 120 more by the end of the 31–10 Pitt win.

As a senior in 1976, he helped lead his school to a national title, picking up the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Award for player of the year, and the United Press International (UPI) Player of the Year award along the way as he led the nation in rushing with 2,150 yards. He was a three-time first-team All-American (1973, 1975, 1976) and a second-team All-American in 1974 by UPI and Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). Dorsett finished his college career with 6,082 total rushing yards, then an NCAA record. This would stand as the record until it was surpassed by Ricky Williams in 1998.

Dorsett was the first Pitt player to have his jersey retired, after being a four-time 1,000-yard rusher and four-time All-American. He is considered one of the greatest running backs in college football history. In 2007, he was ranked #7 on ESPN&#x27;s Top 25 Players in College Football History list. In 1994, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Dallas Cowboys===
Ahead of the 1977 NFL draft, scouts were skeptical about Dorsett&#x27;s potential at the professional level, citing his small size as his primary liability in his long-term durability. After being passed over by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the first overall pick, the Dallas Cowboys selected him with the second overall pick, which they had acquired from the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for the 14th overall (Steve August), 30th overall (Tom Lynch), 41st overall (Terry Beeson), and 54th overall (Glenn Carano) picks; Dorsett had previously told the Seahawks that he would not play for them. Dorsett signed a five-year contract worth a reported $1.1 million, becoming the first contract in Cowboys history to exceed $1 million; it was the second-largest contract signed for a rookie that season, with first overall pick Ricky Bell beating Dorsett with a $1.2 million contract.

From the beginning, Dorsett and head coach Tom Landry had differing opinions on how he should run the ball. Landry initially designed precise running plays, but was eventually convinced that Dorsett was a different type of running back and instructed the offensive line to block and hold their man, while Dorsett chose the running lane with his gifted vision and instincts.

In 1977, Dorsett&#x27;s rookie year, he provided an instant impact, rushing for 1,007 yards (including a 206-yard rushing effort against the Philadelphia Eagles), scoring 12 touchdowns, and earning rookie of the year honors. He set a new Cowboys rookie record and was also the only Cowboy to rush for more than 1,000 yards in his rookie season. He held the record for 39 years, until 2016, when Ezekiel Elliott surpassed 1,000 yards in his 9th game and broke Dorsett&#x27;s record in game 10 with 1,102 yards.

He was named the starter in the 10th game of the season, and became the first player to win the college football championship, then win the Super Bowl the next year, when the Cowboys beat the Denver Broncos 27–10 in Super Bowl XII. In his second season, Dorsett recorded 1,325 yards and 9 touchdowns, with the Cowboys once again reaching the Super Bowl, although they lost 35–31 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XIII.

In 1980, he had one of his best runs. With the ball on the four-yard line against the St. Louis Cardinals, the right defensive end and linebacker had penetration, while the two cornerbacks were blitzing. Dorsett suddenly pivoted on his right foot, turned 360 degrees, and ran wide around the left side, beating the safety and eluding a total of five defenders for a touchdown without being touched.

His most productive season was in 1981, when he recorded 1,646 yards, breaking the Cowboys&#x27; franchise record.

In 1982, his streak of five straight years with at least 1,000 rushing yards was interrupted by the strike-shortened season. Dallas only played 9 games, with Dorsett registering 745 yards and five touchdowns. In the final regular-season game against the Minnesota Vikings, he set a record that can only be tied, with a 99-yard touchdown run. Derrick Henry tied his record with a 99-yard touchdown run in 2018.

Prior to the 1985 season, he held out, demanding that his contract be renegotiated. Defensive tackle Randy White had been given a larger contract by the Cowboys.

In 1986, running back Herschel Walker was signed by the Cowboys and moved to fullback, so he could share backfield duties with Dorsett, becoming the second Heisman backfield tandem in NFL history, after George Rogers and Earl Campbell were teammates on the 1984 New Orleans Saints. This move created tension, as it would limit Dorsett&#x27;s playing time, and because Walker&#x27;s $5 million five-year contract exceeded his $4.5 million five-year contract. Although Dorsett was slowed by ankle and knee injuries that caused him to miss three games, he still led the Cowboys in rushing for the 10th consecutive season with 748 yards.

In 1987, Walker complained to Cowboys management that he was being moved around between three different positions (running back, fullback, wide receiver) and that Dorsett had more carries. He took over as the team&#x27;s main running back, with Dorsett playing in 12 games (six starts) and rushing for 456 yards on 130 carries. Dorsett was not played in two games despite being healthy, which made him demand a trade.

On June 2, 1988, Dorsett was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a conditional fifth-round draft choice. He left as the franchise&#x27;s rushing leader (12,036 yards) and second in league history in postseason rushing yards (1,383).

===Denver Broncos===
The Denver Broncos acquired Dorsett because they were desperate to improve their running game. He reunited with former Cowboys offensive coordinator Dan Reeves and at the age of 34, he reportedly could still run 40 yards in 4.3 seconds. With the retirement of Walter Payton the previous year, he was the career leader in rushing yards among active players. He also had a positive impact on the offense until being limited with injuries late in the season, appearing in 16 games (13 starts), while leading the team with 703 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns. In a November 27, 1988, game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dorsett threw the only touchdown pass of his career (only the second pass completion in eight career attempts, with one interception), for 7 yards to fellow running back Sammy Winder.

On September 26, 1988, Dorsett moved into second place on the all-time rushing list with 12,306 yards, and finished his career with 12,739 yards, trailing only Walter Payton. He retired after having torn left knee ligaments during training camp the following season.

==Legacy==

Dorsett rushed for 12,739 yards and 77 touchdowns in his 12-year career. Dorsett also had 13 receiving scores and even a fumble recovery for a touchdown. On January 3, 1983, during a Monday Night Football game in Minnesota, Dorsett broke a 99-yard touchdown run against the Vikings, which is the longest run from scrimmage in NFL history (Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans would tie this record in 2018). Dorsett broke the previous record of 97 yards, set by Andy Uram in 1939 and Bob Gage in 1949. The Cowboys only had 10 men on the field at the time, as fullback Ron Springs was unaware of the play being called. Despite the feat, the Cowboys lost the game 31–27.

Dorsett made the Pro Bowl 4 times during his career (1978, 1981–1983) and rushed for over 1,000 yards in 8 of his first 9 seasons. Of his 12 NFL seasons, he surpassed 1,000 yards eight times. During the strike-shortened, 9-game season of 1982, he led the NFC in rushing with 745 yards. He was a First-team All-Pro in 1981 and a Second-team All-Pro in 1982 and 1983.

Dorsett was elected to both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1994 and was enshrined in the Texas Stadium Ring of Honor the same year. In 1999, he was ranked number 53 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. He is the first of only two players in history (along with former running back Marcus Allen) who has won the Heisman Trophy, won the Super Bowl, won the College National Championship, been enshrined in the College Hall of Fame, and been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame.

The football stadium at Hopewell High School in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, is named after Dorsett and a street near Acrisure Stadium, the home stadium of the University of Pittsburgh, is named after him.

==NFL career statistics==
==Personal life==

Dorsett has four children: Anthony, Jazmyn, Madison, and Mia (with current wife Janet). His son, Anthony, also played football at the University of Pittsburgh and played defensive back in the NFL from 1996 to 2003, making Super Bowl appearances with the Tennessee Titans (Super Bowl XXXIV) and Oakland Raiders (Super Bowl XXXVII). He is also the uncle of NFL Hall of Fame cornerback Ty Law, a three-time Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots in the late &#x27;90s and early 2000s.

Dorsett hosts the Tony Dorsett Celebrity Golf Classic for McGuire Memorial. This event has raised nearly $5 million in support of McGuire Memorial&#x27;s mission.

Dorsett has helped improve the health of current and former professional athletes through promoting awareness of sleep apnea across the United States. He has teamed up with prize-winning orthodontic technician David Gergen and the Pro Player Health Alliance to hold free public-awareness events in local communities all over the nation. Dorsett has helped get over 150 former players successfully treated for sleep apnea.

==Health issues==
In November 2013, Dorsett announced he had signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease found in many former football players, boxers, and hockey players. Dorsett specifically referred to memory loss and unexplained rage as major symptoms affecting him in retirement.

<text>Albert Jean Amateau (April 20, 1889 – February 9, 1996) was a Turkish rabbi, businessman, lawyer, social activist, and denier of the Armenian genocide.

==Early years ==
Born a Sephardic Jew in Milas, Ottoman Empire (now Turkey), Amateau attended the American International College in İzmir (Smyrna), Turkey. He emigrated to the United States in 1910 to escape conscription after the &quot;Young Turks&quot; revolution of 1908.

==Activism ==
In the early 1920s, Amateau began a movement to bring more Jews into the workplace and government. He was also involved largely in the affairs of deaf people. After he returned from serving in the army in World War I, Amateau was ordained in 1920 at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and he became the first rabbi of a congregation of the deaf. In 1941, Amateau developed the Albert J. Amateau Foreign Language Service, a business providing translators for lipsync dubbing for motion pictures which continued in operation until 1989.

An ardent supporter of his homeland of Turkey, Amateau began various Turkish-oriented organizations while residing in the United States. In 1992, at the age of 103, he helped found the American Society of Jewish Friends of Turkey and was named as its president.

Amateau was also an &quot;advocate of peace&quot;, and in 1937, he assisted with negotiations between Jews and Arabs of Palestine.

He made a Sworn Statement denying the Armenian genocide in Turkey (1915–1923) to oppose approval of a resolution to recognize the said genocide, introduced by Senator Robert Dole in the United States Senate.

Amateau died in 1996 at the age of 106 years, 9 months, 20 days.

<text>Justus Lipsius (Joest Lips or Joost Lips; October 18, 1547 – March 23, 1606) was a Flemish Catholic philologist, philosopher, and humanist. Lipsius wrote a series of works designed to revive ancient Stoicism in a form that would be compatible with Christianity. The most famous of these is &quot;De Constantia&quot; (&quot;On Constancy&quot;). His form of Stoicism influenced a number of contemporary thinkers, creating the intellectual movement of Neostoicism. He taught at the universities in Jena, Leiden, and Leuven.

==Early life==
Lipsius was born in Overijse, Brabant (in modern Belgium). His parents sent him early to the Jesuit college in Cologne, but they feared that he might become a member of the Society of Jesus, so when he was sixteen they removed him to the University of Leuven in Leuven.

The publication of his &quot;Variarum Lectionum Libri Tres&quot; (1567), which he dedicated to Cardinal Granvelle, earned him an appointment as a Latin secretary, and a visit to Rome in the retinue of the cardinal. Here Lipsius remained for two years, devoting his spare time to the study of the Latin classics, collecting inscriptions and examining manuscripts in the Vatican. After he returned from Rome, he published a second volume of miscellaneous criticism (&quot;Antiquarum Lectionum Libri Quinque&quot;, 1575); compared with the &quot;Variae Lectiones&quot; of eight years earlier, it shows that he had advanced from the notion of purely conjectural emendation to that of emending by collation.

==Academic career==
In 1570 he travelled through Burgundy, Germany, Austria, and Bohemia, where the University of Jena engaged him as a teacher for more than a year, a position which implied conformity to the Lutheran Church. On his way back to Leuven, he stopped some time in Cologne, where he must have comported himself as a Catholic.

He then returned to Leuven, but the Eighty Years&#x27; War soon drove him to take refuge via Antwerp to the Northern Netherlands, where, in 1579, the newly founded University of Leiden appointed him professor of history. He held the position of rector of the university for four terms and was a driving force behind the growth and innovation in the early years.

The eleven years that Lipsius spent in Leiden were the period of his greatest productivity. It was during this time that he prepared his Seneca, and perfected, in successive editions, his Tacitus, and brought out a series of other works. Some were pure scholarship, some were collections from classical authors, and others were of general interest. One of this latter class was a treatise on politics (&quot;Politicorum Libri Sex&quot;, 1589), in which he showed that, though a public teacher in a country which professed toleration, he had not departed from the state maxims of Alva and Philip II. He wrote that a government should recognize only one religion, and extirpate dissent by fire and sword. This avowal exposed him to attacks, but the prudent authorities of Leiden saved him, by prevailing upon him to publish a declaration that his expression &quot;Ure, seca&quot; (&quot;Burn and cut&quot;) was a metaphor for a vigorous treatment.

==Later life==

In the spring of 1590, leaving Leiden under pretext of taking the waters in Spa, he went to Mainz, where he reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church. This event deeply interested the Catholic world, and invitations from the courts and universities of Italy, Austria and Spain poured in on Lipsius. But he preferred to remain in his own country, and he finally settled in Leuven, as professor of Latin in the Collegium Buslidianum. In 1591 he undertook a grand tour of France, Italy and Germany with his young friend and later Amsterdam burgomaster Jacob Dircksz de Graeff.

He was not expected to teach, and appointments as privy councillor and historiographer royal to King Philip II of Spain eked out his trifling stipend. He continued to publish dissertations as before, the chief being his &quot;De militia romana&quot; (1595) and his &quot;Lovanium&quot; (1605), intended as an introduction to a general history of Brabant.

Lipsius died in Leuven, at the age of 58.

==Legacy==
The former headquarters of the European Council (2004–2017) and the Council of the European Union (1995–2017), the Justus Lipsius building, bears his name, having been constructed over the site of &quot;Rue Juste Lipse&quot;, which linked &quot;Rue Belliard&quot; to &quot;Rue de la Loi&quot; in the European Quarter of Brussels. The building is still used by both institutions for offices and low-level meetings and so &quot;Justus Lipsius&quot; features heavily in the EU-lexicon.

In 2006, he was selected to appear on the 10 euro Justus Lipsius Silver commemorative Coin, minted by Belgium. The reverse side of the coin shows his portrait together with the years of his life (1547–1606).

One of the main buildings of Leiden University which serve as the Faculty of Humanities was named after Lipsius.

==Political thinking==
The German historian Gerhard Oestreich has argued that Lipsius&#x27;s ideas about the ideal citizen, a man who acts according to reason, is answerable to himself, is in control of his emotions, and is ready to fight, had found wide acceptance in the turbulent times of the Reformation. The Lipsian view, translated to politics, would have been at the basis of rationalisation of the state and its apparatus of government, autocratic rule by the prince, discipline dispensed to subjects, and strong military defence. The principles would have laid the foundation for military revolution that transformed first European warfare and then the internal organisation of the European states themselves. These conclusions of Oestreich have met with some scepticism in the academic community, and the notion that Lipsius&#x27; political ideas had a decisive influence on political developments and military reforms in the Dutch Republic has been challenged.

<doc id="327918" wikidata="Q7753924" url="?curid=327918" title="The News Quiz">
<text>The News Quiz is a British topical panel game broadcast on BBC Radio 4, first broadcast in 1977. The show, created by John Lloyd from an idea by Nicholas Parsons, has seen several hosts, including Barry Norman, Barry Took, Simon Hoggart, Sandi Toksvig, and Miles Jupp. Andy Zaltzman was announced as the permanent host after series 103. The show involves four panellists, often comedians or journalists, who answer questions about events of the previous week, often leading to humorous and satirical exchanges. The show was adapted for television in 1981 and has also inspired other shows, such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

==History==
&quot;The News Quiz&quot; was created by John Lloyd, based on an idea by Nicholas Parsons.

The series was first broadcast in 1977 with Barry Norman in the chair. Subsequently it was chaired by Barry Took from 1979 to 1981, Simon Hoggart from 1981 to 1986, Took again from 1986 to 1995, and then again by Hoggart from 1996 until March 2006. Hoggart was replaced by Sandi Toksvig in September 2006, who in turn was replaced by Miles Jupp in September 2015 until his departure at the end of 2019. Three different hosts took the chair in 2020; Nish Kumar (series 101), Angela Barnes (series 102), and Andy Zaltzman (series 103). At the end of series 103, it was announced that Zaltzman would continue as permanent host. 

Originally, &quot;Private Eye&quot; editor Richard Ingrams and &quot;Punch&quot; editor Alan Coren acted as team captains.

It was adapted for television in 1981 under the title &quot;Scoop&quot;, running for two series, and later inspired the television programme &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In 2012, the BBC piloted an American version hosted by Lewis Black.

On 28 June 2013, the &quot;News Quiz&quot; paid tribute after the death of Radio 4 announcer Rory Morrison, who had read the news cuttings on the programme.

During series 97, running from August to October 2018, Jupp was absent due to filming commitments overseas, so show regulars Simon Evans, Susan Calman, Fred MacAulay, Bridget Christie, Jo Brand and Lucy Porter took turns in the host&#x27;s seat. Jupp himself chaired the first and last episodes of the series.

In May 2019, it was announced that Jupp would leave the show at the end of the 99th series at the end of the month. Series 100 had several hosts: Nish Kumar, Angela Barnes, Andy Zaltzman, Phil Wang, Kiri Pritchard-McLean, Zoe Lyons, Patrick Kielty and Andrew Maxwell. The hosts for 2020 were Nish Kumar, Angela Barnes, and Andy Zaltzman. Zaltzman was named as the permanent host at the conclusion of series 103.

==Transmission==
The programme is usually recorded in front of an audience on Thursday evenings at the BBC Radio Theatre at Broadcasting House in central London. It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30, then repeated at Saturday lunchtime. The final 28-minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording. In 2012, the BBC began making an extended version for BBC Radio 4 Extra.

Each week, four panellists appear on the show. They are usually either comedians or journalists, and sometimes politicians. Journalists predominated in the early years. The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants&#x27; knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events. However, this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered. The participants frequently wander off topic. The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to, usually with a scripted comic punchline, before asking the next question. It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached. Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores, the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing.

<doc id="327921" wikidata="Q6188297" url="?curid=327921" title="Jesus is Lord">
<text>&quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; () is the shortest credal affirmation found in the New Testament, one of several slightly more elaborate variations. It serves as a statement of faith for the majority of Christians who regard Jesus as both fully man and God. It is the motto of the World Council of Churches.

==Background==
In antiquity, in general use, the term &quot;lord&quot; was a courtesy title for social superiors, but its root meaning was &quot;ruler&quot;. Kings everywhere were styled &quot;Lord&quot; and often considered divine beings so the word acquired a religious significance. When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek in the Septuagint at least two centuries before Christianity, &quot;Kurios&quot; was used for the divine tetragrammaton YHWH which was no longer read aloud but replaced with &quot;adonai&quot;, a special form of the Hebrew &quot;adon&quot; = &quot;lord&quot;.

When in 27 BC Roman Emperor Octavian received the title of &quot;Augustus&quot; it carried religious overtones, suggesting a special relationship with the world of the gods, symbolised by the cult of the Emperor&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot;, a veiled form of emperor-worship. To refuse to honor the national gods was unpatriotic and akin to sabotage.

J. G. Davies comments that the Christian begins from the confession of Jesus as Lord – Jesus who is sovereign over the individual&#x27;s relation to the state, &quot;we must understand the state in the context of the command to love one&#x27;s neighbour.&quot;

==Credal phrases in the New Testament==

In Pauline Christianity, J. N. D. Kelly points out creed-like slogans attributed to Paul the Apostle in Galatians, 2 Thessalonians, Romans and 1 Corinthians, though they never formed a fixed, standard creed. The most popular and briefest was &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; found in ; and probably in the baptisms referred to in Acts 8:16; 19:5 and 1 Cor 6:11 since their being described as &quot;in the name of the Lord Jesus&quot; certainly seems to imply that &quot;the formula &#x27;Jesus is Lord&#x27; had a place in the rite&quot;. The phrase might be extended as &quot;Jesus Christ is Lord&quot; as in .

In the early days, the similar formula &quot;Jesus is the Christ&quot; was found, but this faded into the background when its original Messianic significance was forgotten. Of more long-term significance was the affirmation &quot;Jesus is the Son of God&quot;. These were expounded upon by passages such as and which describe Christ&#x27;s work of salvation and the existence of witnesses to his resurrection and he goes on in the following pages to list another ten examples of passages which attach to the name of Jesus &quot;selected incidents in the redemptive story&quot;.

<text>Stockton-on-Tees is a market town in County Durham, England, with a population of 84,815 at the 2021 UK census. It gives its name to and is the largest settlement in the wider Borough of Stockton-on-Tees. It is part of Teesside and the Tees Valley, on the northern bank of the River Tees.

The Tees was straightened in the early 19th century for larger ships to access the town. The ports have since relocated closer to the North Sea and ships are no longer able to sail from the sea to the town due to the Tees Barrage, which was installed to manage tidal flooding. The Stockton and Darlington Railway, served the port during early part of the Industrial Revolution. The railway was also the world&#x27;s first permanent steam-locomotive-powered passenger railway.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
&quot;Stockton&quot; is an Anglo-Saxon place name with the common ending &quot;ton&quot;, meaning &quot;farm&quot;, or &quot;homestead&quot;. &quot;Stock&quot; is thought by some to derive from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Stocc&quot;, meaning &quot;log&quot;, &quot;tree trunk&quot;, or &quot;wooden post&quot;. &quot;Stockton&quot; could therefore mean &quot;a farm built of logs&quot;. This is disputed because when &quot;Stocc&quot; forms the first part of a place name, it usually indicates a derivation from the similar word &quot;Stoc&quot;, meaning &quot;cell&quot;, &quot;monastery&quot;, or &quot;place&quot;. &quot;Stoc&quot; in place name such as Stoke or Stow usually indicates farms which belonged to a manor or religious house. It is possible the name is an indication that Stockton was an outpost of Durham or Norton which were both important Anglo-Saxon centres. Stockton was a township in the ancient parish of Norton until 1713, when it became an independent parish in its own right. Norton and Stockton&#x27;s historic roles were reversed in 1913 when Norton was absorbed into the borough of Stockton.

=== Prehistory ===
Stockton is reportedly the home of the fossilised remains of the most northerly hippopotamus ever discovered. In 1958, an archeological dig north-west of the town uncovered a 125,000-year-old hippo&#x27;s molar tooth. However, no one knows exactly where the tooth was discovered, who discovered it, or why the dig took place. The tooth was sent to the borough&#x27;s librarian and curator, G. F. Leighton, who then sent it to the Natural History Museum in London. Since then, the tooth has been missing despite efforts to locate it.

===Market and castle===
Stockton began as an Anglo-Saxon settlement on high ground close to the northern bank of the River Tees.

Stockton was described as a manor by 1138, and was purchased by Bishop Pudsey of Durham in 1189. During the 13th century, the bishop changed the village of Stockton into a borough; the exact date the borough was founded is unknown, but it was being described as a borough by 1283. When the bishop freed Stockton&#x27;s serfs, craftsmen moved to the new town. The bishop had a residence in Stockton Castle, which was a fortified manor house, the first recorded reference to which was in 1376.

Stockton&#x27;s market traces its history to 1310, when Bishop Bek of Durham granted a market charter &quot;to our town of Stockton a market upon every Wednesday for ever&quot;. The town grew into a small but busy port, exporting wool and importing wine, which was in demand by the upper class. However, even by the standards of the time, medieval Stockton-on-Tees was a small town, with a population of only approximately 1,000; the town did not grow for centuries.

Scotland captured Stockton Castle in 1644, and occupied it until 1646. The castle was destroyed at the order of Oliver Cromwell at the end of the Civil War. A shopping centre, the Castlegate Centre, now occupies the castle area, and this is scheduled for demolition in 2022. No known accurate depictions of the castle exist.

The Town House (now called the Town Hall) was built in 1735, and Stockton&#x27;s first theatre opened in 1766. In 1771, a five-arch stone bridge was built, replacing the nearby Bishop&#x27;s Ferry. Until the opening of the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge in 1911, this was the Tees&#x27;s most downstream bridging point. From the end of the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution transformed Stockton from a small and quiet market town into a flourishing centre of heavy industry.

In 1833, the then Bishop of Durham, William Van Mildert (1765–1836) gifted five acres and the land of an existing burial site called &quot;The Monument&quot; (originally a mass grave from a prior cholera outbreak) to the town of Stockton. Upon this land, the process of building of and designing the gothic style Holy Trinity Church began, using funds originally allocated for church building in the Church Building Act 1818. It was designed by John and Benjamin Green, and construction began in 1834. It was consecrated as an Anglican church on 22 December 1835.

===Locomotion===
Shipbuilding, which had started in the 15th century, prospered in the town through the 17th and 18th centuries, with smaller-scale industries also developing. These included brick, sail, and rope making, the latter now reflected in road names such as Ropery Street in the town centre. Stockton became the major port for County Durham, the North Riding of Yorkshire, and Westmorland during this period, exporting mainly rope, agricultural produce and lead from the Yorkshire Dales. Iron making and engineering entered the local economy in the 18th century

The town grew rapidly as the Industrial Revolution started, the population grew from 10,000 in 1851 to over 50,000 in 1901 as workers moved in. The discovery of iron ore in the Eston Hills resulted in blast furnaces lining the River Tees from Stockton to the river&#x27;s mouth. In 1820, an Act set up the Commissioners, a body with responsibility for lighting and cleaning the streets, and from 1822, Stockton-on-Tees was lit by gas.
In 1822, Stockton witnessed an event which changed the face of the world forever, and which heralded the dawn of a new era in trade, industry and travel. The first rail of George Stephenson&#x27;s Stockton and Darlington Railway was laid near St. John&#x27;s crossing on Bridge Road. Hauled by Locomotion No 1, Stephenson himself manned the engine on its first journey on 27 September 1825. Fellow engineer and friend Timothy Hackworth acted as guard. This was the world&#x27;s first passenger railway, connecting Stockton with Shildon. The opening of the railway greatly boosted Stockton&#x27;s economy, making it easier to bring coal to the factories; however, the port declined as business moved downstream to Middlesbrough.

Stockton witnessed another development in 1827. Local chemist John Walker invented the friction match in his shop at 59 High Street. The first sale of these matches was recorded in his sales-book on 7 April 1827, to a Mr. Hixon, a solicitor in the town. Since he did not obtain a patent, Walker received neither fame nor wealth for his invention, but he was able to retire some years before his death. He died in 1859 at the age of 78, and is buried in the parish churchyard in Norton village.

The first bell for Big Ben was cast by John Warner and Sons in Norton on 6 August 1856, but it was damaged beyond repair while being tested on site, and it had to be replaced by a foundry closer to Westminster, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.

To cater to the increased population, a hospital opened in Stockton in 1862, and a public library opened in 1877. Public transport also became important. Steam trams began running in the streets in 1881, and these were replaced by electric trams in 1897.

===1930s===

Stockton was still dominated by the engineering industry in the 1930s, and there was also a chemicals industry in the town. 
Buses replaced the trams in 1931. Public housing also became necessary, and in the 1930s, slums were cleared, and the first council houses were built.

On 10 September 1933, the Battle of Stockton took place, in which between 200 and 300 supporters of the British Union of Fascists were taken to Stockton to hold a rally, but they were driven out of town by up to 2,000 anti-fascist demonstrators.

===Services and riots===
In the late 20th century, manufacturing severely declined, with the service industries developed into the town&#x27;s primary employers.

The Ragworth district near the town centre was the scene of rioting in July 1992, when local youths threw stones at buildings, set cars alight, and threw missiles at police and fire crews. The area later saw a £12 million regeneration which involved mass demolition and refurbishment of existing properties, and construction of new housing and community facilities.

== Geography ==

Stockton lies on the north bank of the River Tees. The town&#x27;s northern and western extremities are on slightly higher ground than the town centre, which is directly on the Tees. Stockton experiences occasional earth tremors. For example, it was the epicentre of a tremor measuring 2.8 on the Richter scale on 23 January 2020. The town has many areas outside of the town centre; Fairfield, Portrack, Hardwick, Hartburn, Elm Tree Farm, Norton, Roseworth, Newtown, Bishopsgarth and Oxbridge. Norton is the second largest centre in the town.

===Distance to other places===
=== Climate ===
Stockton-on-Tees has an oceanic climate typical of the United Kingdom. Being sheltered by the Lake District and Pennines to the west, Stockton is relatively dry for the U.K., with on average 25 inches (643 mm) of rain a year. Its climate is more continental climate than other parts of the U.K., with above average summer temperatures, and below average winter temperatures. Summer highs typically reach approximately 20 °C (68 °F), while winter lows can fall to several degrees below 0 °C (32 °F). The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate).

=== Town centre ===

Stockton town centre is the heart of the borough. The High Street—the widest in the UK—heads north through the town centre from the junction of Bridge Road and Yarm Lane, to Maxwell&#x27;s Corner, where Norton Road and Bishopton Lane begin. Dovecot Street runs west from the High Street&#x27;s midway point, and further north, Church Road extends east toward Northshore and the River Tees. At the centre of the High Street stands Stockton-on-Tees Town Hall, dating from 1735, and the Georgian-style Shambles Market Hall. Around the town hall, the largest outdoor market in North East England, which has been in existence since the 1300s, continues to be held every Wednesday and Saturday.

Much of the town centre has a Georgian and late medieval influence, with a number of listed buildings and a variety of architectural types, which help to define the town&#x27;s identity. The shops predominantly have narrow frontages stretching back to gain floorspace. This burgage plot style is particularly evident around the marketplace and on side streets such as Silver Street, Finkle Street and Ramsgate. There is also the surviving ruins of the gothic style church in Trinity Green, which dates back to 1834.

Before 2022, the town centre retail was largely concentrated within two shopping centres, Castlegate and Wellington Square. Wellington Square has open shops on pedestrian-only paths whereas the Castlegate, opened in 1972 and currently undergoing demolition, was a building which incorporated a multi-storey car park and an indoor market. Its façade was a dominant feature along the south east of the High Street, its site bounded by Finkle Street, Bridge Road and Tower Street. The Riverside dual carriageway and the River Tees run almost parallel to the rear of the centre. The Teesquay Millennium Footbridge links the Castlegate Quay on the north side of the river to Teesdale Business Park and Durham University&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus on the south side in the ceremonial county of the North Riding of Yorkshire. Situated at the north west end of the town centre is Wellington Square shopping centre, built on the old Wellington Street. Opened in 2001 at a cost of £43 million, it houses 46 shop units.

The town centre has retained a number of original yards such as Wasp Nest Yard, Hambletonian Yard, and Ship Inn Yard. Most notable is Green Dragon Yard, a courtyard of restored historic warehouses within a series of alleyways. Considered the cultural quarter of the town, this houses the Green Dragon public house, the Green Dragon Studios (recording studios) and Britain&#x27;s oldest surviving Georgian Theatre.

Alongside retail outlets, Stockton town centre also has a variety of services including national banks and building societies, travel agents, a post office, hairdressers, beauticians, cafés, and restaurants. The refurbishment of some period buildings has provided space for small firms including solicitors, recruitment agencies, and accountants.

=== Demolition and construction of the Waterfront ===
In 2019, with the council trying to tackle the centre&#x27;s empty shops, the council bought both Wellington Square and Castlegate Centre, with Castlegate Centre to be demolished along with the Stockton Swallow Hotel in order to create a new urban park on the old site of the two demolished buildings.

The new urban park proposed called &quot;Waterfront&quot; is to be an urban park with open, flexible spaces for community, and large scale events. The development will also include the narrowing and tunnelling of Riverside Road allowing people to walk straight from the High Street to the River Tees. To be built alongside the Waterfront is a new NHS health hub offering rapid scans, tests and checks, creating 130 roles for the area. This new development will concentrate Stockton&#x27;s retail area to be within Wellington Square.

The Waterfront started development with the demolition of Castlegate Centre and the Swallow Hotel in September 2022, with all demolition work completed by the end of 2023. Since then the NHS health hub&#x27;s exterior has been built and can be seen from the Town centre with the rest of the development undergoing construction.

=== Riverside ===

Since the construction of the Tees Barrage in 1995, the level of the River Tees through the town has permanently been held at high tide, creating a backdrop for riverside events and facilitating watersports activities such as rowing, canoeing, jet skiing, and dragon boat racing. Stockton town centre is elevated above the river, and is separated from the riverside by the A1305 Riverside Road, a dual carriageway which runs parallel to the river from Northshore to Chandlers Wharf.

From the town centre, Bishop Street, Silver Street, Calvert&#x27;s Lane, and Thistle Green offer views of the river where it meanders around Teesdale Business Park. Durham University Queen&#x27;s Campus can be seen on the opposite side, alongside the skyline of Middlesbrough in the middle distance and Roseberry Topping in the Cleveland Hills, approximately south east.

Chandlers Wharf is situated on the north side of the river where Bridge Road approaches Victoria Bridge. The area is characterised by a mixture of office and residential accommodation, including the colourful twelve-storey Mezzino student apartments at Rialto Court, a Mecca Bingo hall, Burger King and the two-storey Grosvenor Casino, which opened in September 2011. Adjacent to the wharf is Castlegate Quay, which was once the town&#x27;s main dock. The quayside is still occupied by Georgian warehouses which have been converted into a number of business units, restaurants, and a gym. A full-size replica of Captain James Cook&#x27;s ship HM Bark Endeavour was once moored at the quayside, but was sold and moved after refurbishment to a mooring in Whitby. The Teesside Princess, a two-deck river boat, is docked alongside, and offers river cruises all year to Yarm via Preston Park.

Both the north and south banks of the Tees are retained by steel sheet pile walls, and have footpaths along the river edge. The Tees Walkway on the north bank of the river can be accessed from the town centre by the Teesquay Millennium Footbridge or the Riverside Footbridge, and incorporates a cycle path which forms part of the National Cycle Network. 

The 11-metre Aeolian Motion wind sculpture stands on a grassy slope overlooking the riverside, which becomes an amphitheatre during large events. From Castlegate Quay, the tree-lined path along the waterfront toward the Princess of Wales Bridge opens into green space and a car park for events. Beyond the Princess of Wales Bridge, the slipway at the River Tees Watersports Centre is situated at the western area of Northshore, which is currently under development, and which leads to the Tees Barrage.

== Transport ==

===Road===
The town is served by two main arterial roads: the transpennine A66 (east/west) and the A19 (north/south). The A19 connects Stockton with York in the south, and extends to Peterlee and Sunderland, to the north. East of the town centre is the A1046, a mostly dual carriageway which runs through Portrack as Portrack Lane, a major retail zone, particularly for home furnishings and DIY. From Portrack, the A1046 continues to its northern terminus at Port Clarence. The A139 connects the town centre with the northern suburb of Norton. This was the original route for the A19 before a bypass was built to the east of the town.

The A177 runs from Stockton town centre to Durham. Known as Durham Road, it passes Sedgefield en route, and is a major route in to and out of Stockton.

The A66 connects Stockton directly to Middlesbrough ( to the east) and Darlington ( to the west). Beyond Darlington lies the A1(M). The A66 is connected to Stockton centre by the A135. The old A135 was renumbered A1027, and this continues through the town to Billingham. The A135 is named &#x27;1825 Way&#x27; to commemorate the former Stockton and Darlington Railway&#x27;s opening; the 1825 Way&#x27;s northern end is St John&#x27;s Crossing, adjacent to the old Stockton Railway Station buildings.

A number of bus services operate in Stockton, and most services pass through the High Street. The services cover large areas of the region including Middlesbrough, Teesside Park, Thornaby-on-Tees, Billingham, Sedgefield, Durham, Sunderland, Peterlee, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Stagecoach on Teesside and Arriva North East are the major service providers, while six smaller companies also operate in the area.

===Rail===
 station, located above the High Street, serves the town; however, more regular and long-distance trains run from nearby .

Northern routinely serves both stations with local and regional services, whereas at Thornaby TransPennine Express runs an hourly service between Saltburn-by-the-Sea and Manchester Airport via York and LNER stops once both ways every weekday between Middlesbrough and London King&#x27;s Cross.

===Air===
Teesside International Airport is partially located within the borough, several miles west of the town. The airport offers domestic flights and services international festival destinations, especially in the EU.

== Education ==
== Economy ==

Stockton is famous as the home of the friction match and the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which operated the world&#x27;s first steam-hauled passenger train in 1825. The town also has the world&#x27;s oldest passenger railway station building. Industry and engineering remained central to Stockton&#x27;s economy over many years, and major industries have included shipbuilding and repair, heavy engineering, steel, and chemicals manufacturing. However, during the twentieth century, Teesside&#x27;s heavy industry declined dramatically.

=== Development ===
Since the 1980s, Stockton has seen an increase in service industries. The development of Teesdale Business Park on the south bank of the River Tees has created commercial space with many large service providers opening call centres and offices in the area. Durham University&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus is also situated within the Teesdale development, which is linked to the town centre by the Teesquay Millennium Footbridge, Princess of Wales Bridge, and Infinity Bridge.

In 1995, after four years&#x27; construction, the Tees Barrage was commissioned, permanently holding the upstream river waters at the level of an average high tide.

In 2007, funding from the European Regional Development Fund and English Heritage secured the ruins of the Holy Trinity Church, and renovated the site into Trinity Green, removing the site from Historic England&#x27;s &#x27;Heritage At Risk register&#x27;.

=== Future development ===

Work is under way to develop the north bank of the River Tees in Stockton with the £300 million Northshore scheme, which will include new offices, leisure facilities, housing, a 150-bedroom hotel, and a new campus for Durham University.

In 2012, a long-term scheme aimed at transforming the town centre area was announced, with investment of approximately £38 million, just over £20 million being contributed by Stockton Borough Council, and the remainder coming from the private sector and grants. The investment programme aimed to attract more retailers, businesses, and shoppers to the town by opening up new spaces and links to the River Tees, providing easier access and parking, and capitalising on the town&#x27;s heritage and cultural assets.

Plans include the introduction of an expansive plaza area &#x27;Infinity View&#x27; that will open up the pedestrian area to dramatic views of the award-winning Infinity Bridge. Under the scheme, the banks of the River Tees will be transformed with a series of impressive light installations which will stretch along the waterfront, from the Princess of Wales Bridge to the Millennium Bridge. This permanent colourful illumination is intended to add value to the riverside businesses and restaurants and play an important part in the council&#x27;s events programme throughout the year.

Stockton is one of 12 towns in England to share in £1.2 million of funding, support from retail guru Mary Portas and her own team, as part of the Portas Pilot scheme. Selected from over 370 applications, Stockton&#x27;s Town Team Consortium, comprising Stockton Council, Tees Music Alliance, Durham University Queen&#x27;s Campus, town centre retailers, A Way Out and Stockton Heritage in Partnership, will have the opportunity to share in expert advice and guidance from a range of retail experts.

The Stockton-Middlesbrough Initiative is a 20-year vision for regenerating the urban core of the Tees Valley, the main focus being the area along the banks of the River Tees between the two centres of Stockton and Middlesbrough. The master plan has been drawn up by environmental design specialists Gillespies, the eventual aim being to bring distinctive high-quality city-scale assets to the centre of the Tees Valley, including the town centres of Stockton and Middlesbrough. The project will include the existing developments at North Shore, Stockton and Middlesbrough, with many others over a 15- to 20-year period.

In February 2020 it was announced that the Castlegate Shopping Centre is set to be demolished in 2022.

=== Income ===

The mean weekly income for Stockton residents was £522.70 in 2017. This is below the U.K. mean of £538.70. In some parts of Stockton, most households&#x27; income is below the poverty threshold. The mean privately rented house in Stockton cost £525 per month in 2017, compared with a mean of £480 across North East England.

== Crime ==
The town recorded 125 crimes for every 1,000 people in 2020, higher than similarly sized Darlington and Hartlepool and 29% higher than ceremonial County Durham&#x27;s 89 out of 1,000 average. The most common crimes in 2020 were &quot;violence and sexual offences&quot;; 4,445 of this type were recorded in 2020. Eight out of 14 crime trends improved compared to 2019. The Eastbourne and Newham Grange Ward recorded the worst crime statistics in the town. The borough came out lower than the four other Tees Valley boroughs in 2017.

===Enforcement===
Stockton comes under Cleveland Police&#x27;s jurisdiction. There are two police stations in town, town centre main and Newton neighbourhood. Teesside combined courts are located in Middlesbrough.

HMP Holme House, in Portrack, is a 1211-capacity Category B prison for male adult prisoners who are either remanded in custody or convicted. It also accommodates a small number of young offenders aged 18–21 years. The prison opened in May 1992 and mainly serves south of county Durham as well as north of North Yorkshire.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 census, the borough was recorded as having a population of 196,595 with 50.9% being female.

For religion, 51.1% identified themselves as Christian, 39.1% having no religion, 3.4% Muslim, 0.4% Hindu, 0.4% Sikh, 0.3% Buddhist, and 0.3% answering &#x27;Other&#x27; as well as 5% not answering.

For ethnicity, those who identified as White were 92.0%, Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh were 4.6%, Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African were 1.1%, Mixed or &#x27;Multiple ethnic groups&#x27; were 1.4%, and the &#x27;Other&#x27; ethnic group category recorded 0.8%.

For sexuality, those who identified as Straight or Heterosexual were 91.6%, Gay or Lesbian were 1.4%, Bisexual was 0.9%, Pansexual was 0.2%, Asexual was 0.0%, Queer was 0.0%, &#x27;All other sexual orientations&#x27; were 0.0% and those who did not answer were 5.9%.

[Note, for percentages with 0.0%, this may due to a number too low to represent using the number of digits supplied rather than a lack of those who identified as that specific idea.]

=== Festivals and fairs ===
Stockton Calling is an Easter Sunday music festival which has taken place across several of Stockton&#x27;s music venues annually since 2010. In 2019, it celebrated its 11th year, and was headlined by Sophie and the Giants.

The Stockton International Riverside Festival (SIRF), one of Europe&#x27;s largest open air festivals, has taken over the town once a year since 1988. Spread over a long weekend, for either four or five days, it attracts over 250,000 visitors, and features a variety of acts such as circus, comedy, music, dance and street theatre.

The annual riverside firework display happens on the first Sunday closest to 5 November, and is typically attended by up to 100,000 spectators from the wider region. The year&#x27;s events always conclude with the Stockton Sparkles Christmas festival and associated markets.

=== Theatres and music venues ===

The ARC Theatre &amp; Arts Centre on Dovecot Street was built in 1999, and comprises a multi-purpose arts centre for cinema, theatre, dance, and music. It has three floors including four venues: a 260-seat theatre, a 100-seat studio theatre, a point/music area accommodating 550 standing, and a 130-seat cinema. It also has exhibition spaces, meeting rooms, a café, and two bars.

The Georgian Theatre at Green Dragon Yard is Grade II listed, and is the oldest Georgian theatre in the country. Originally opened in 1766, it fell into disrepair during the 19th century, but later functioned as a sweet factory and then a community building. Between 2007 and 2008, the building was given a full makeover along with the neighbouring Green Dragon Studios, and now serves as an intimate venue for live entertainment with a capacity of 200.

The Grade-II listed Globe Theatre built in 1936 is at the north western end of the High Street, the theatre reopened in 2021 following extensive restoration. It was built on the same site as two previous theatres, and has hosted many famous acts such as Buddy Holly, the Platters, Guy Mitchell, the Rolling Stones, the Animals, Cilla Black, Carl Perkins, Cliff Richard, the Shadows and Chuck Berry. The Beatles famously played the Globe on Friday 22 November 1963, the day U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

=== Public art ===
==== &quot;Stockton Flyer&quot; ====
On 12 June 2016, Stockton Council launched The &quot;Stockton Flyer&quot;, a stylised model of a flying steam locomotive in a plinth on Stockton High Street. The Flyer was unveiled to mark Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s official 90th birthday on 12 June 2016. The &quot;Stockton Flyer&quot; appears from the plinth every day at 1 p.m., and often draws a crowd of people watching the rising and lowering of the structure.

==== &quot;Aeolian Motion&quot; ====
Designed by Phil Johnson of Ratho Forge, the wind sculpture &quot;Aeolian Motion&quot; was constructed at the end of Silver Street in March and April 2001. The design is said to impart a unique identity to the seating area, reflecting the character of Stockton, and creating a sense of place.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees, the local based-television station TalkTeesside also broadcast to the town. Television signals are received from the Bilsdale TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Tees, Heart North East, Hits Radio Teesside, Capital North East, Smooth North East, Greatest Hits Radio Teesside and CVFM Radio, a community based station that broadcast from nearby Middlesbrough. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Evening Gazette&quot;.

== Facilities ==
Public services provided in Stockton include a general hospital, health advice centres, dental and medical surgeries, a library, churches, employment advice centres, youth projects, energy advice centres and an international family centre. A cluster of municipal buildings is concentrated primarily along Church Road. The police headquarters is the only emergency service station located within the centre, next to Stockton Central Library.

The University Hospital of North Tees is located in the town and serves south east County Durham. It is part of the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust.

=== Public parks ===

Stockton has a number of public parks and nature reserves. Most notable is Ropner Park, a Victorian-style park on the outskirts of the town, near Hartburn village. Opened in 1893 and renovated in 2007, the park has tree-lined avenues approaching an ornate water fountain, surrounded by rockeries and floral displays. Overlooking a lake, a bandstand features live band music on Sunday afternoons in the summer. Seasonal fairs and occasional organised events are staged at the park throughout the year. Close by, there is also the smaller park housing the ruins of the Holy Trinity Church, now called Trinity Green.

Further upstream is Preston Park, a public park by the River Tees. The park hosts many events each year that attract people from across Teesside and further afield. Preston Hall, once the home of Sir Robert Ropner, is situated within the grounds, and is now a museum. The park also houses &#x27;Butterfly World&#x27;, an artificial tropical environment housing various species of exotic butterflies and reptiles.

Downstream is Portrack Marsh Nature Reserve, a nature reserve by the northern bank of the river between the Tees Barrage and the Tees Viaduct near Portrack housing estate. It is the last remaining wetland on the lower Tees. Ownership of the reserve is divided between the Tees Valley Wildlife Trust and Northumbrian Water, but the reserve is managed by the Tees Valley Wildlife Trust. The western and northern parts of the reserve are mature marsh, while there are a series of man–made ponds in the south east.

=== Leisure ===

The town&#x27;s main leisure facility is &#x27;Splash&#x27;, a large wet and dry facility on Church Road which includes a 25m pool with a wave machine and flumes, a learner pool, a spa pool, a two-storey fitness facility, dry multi-activity spaces, a café and Sportwall &amp; dance facilities. The Castlegate Quay Watersports Centre also offers opportunities for sailing and paddling on the River Tees.

=== Libraries ===

Stockton Central Library on Church Road is the largest public library serving the borough of Stockton-on-Tees. Built in 1967, it was fully refurbished in 2011 at a cost of £1.9m. It occupies two floors: the ground floor incorporates Stockton Borough Council&#x27;s Customer Services Centre, an adult lending library, and a children&#x27;s library, while the first floor houses the reference library (the central reference department for the borough), a family history suite, a computer suite with free internet access, and the &#x27;Starbooks&#x27; café. The library also has conference facilities and an exhibition area.

==Religion==

Stockton is a Church of England deanery of the Archdeaconry of Auckland, in the Diocese of Durham. The churches of St Peter, Stockton Parish Church (St Thomas&#x27;), and St Paul are in the town. Holy Trinity Church was built as an Anglican church, later became Greek Orthodox, and was then destroyed by fire in 1991. The ruins remain on site.

Stockton is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, and is home to the parishes of St Bede, St Cuthbert, English Martyrs and SS Peter and Paul, St Joseph, St Mary, and St Patrick.

Stockton also has a sizable Muslim population (6,675), with mosques such as Farooq E Azam Mosque and Islamic Centre serving this community. The Farooq E Azam mosque is especially of note, due to the recent council decision to allow the call to prayer, or Adhan, to be played once at week at an agreed volume, the first mosque in the north-east of England to do so.

== Sport ==

Stockton Cricket Club was established in 1816, and has been located at the Grangefield Cricket Ground since 1891. The club currently fields three senior teams at weekends in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the Dukes North East Premier League.

Stockton Football Club existed from 1882 until it folded in 1975. They played at the Victoria Ground which also held greyhound racing (one of two venues in the town to do so along with Belle Vue Park). The club&#x27;s assets were transferred to Norton Cricket Club, who subsequently founded the Norton &amp; Stockton Ancients Football Club. There are two other football clubs in the town. Stockton Town F.C. play in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. After consecutive promotions winning the Wearside League in 2016 and Northern League Division 2 in 2017, then gaining promotion to Step 4 of the pyramid system as a result of 2 curtailed seasons due to Covid.

<text>The M67 is a urban motorway in Greater Manchester, England, which heads east from the M60 motorway passing through Denton and Hyde before ending near Mottram. The road was originally conceived as the first section of a trans-Pennine motorway between Manchester and Sheffield that would connect the A57(M) motorway with the M1 motorway; however, the motorway became the only part to be built.

Numerous calls have been made over the decades to complete the motorway link between Manchester and Sheffield, the second and ninth most populous urban areas within the United Kingdom. Traffic between the cities is mainly divided between the Snake (A57) and Woodhead (A628) passes, which traverse the Peak District. Several plans were suspended and a proposal to link the two cities with a tunnelled scheme underneath the Peak District did not go ahead. In 2024, plans for the Longdendale Bypass, a road that will bypass the heavily congested section of the A57 in Mottram, were approved and cleared for construction.

==Route==

The M67 heads east from the M60 motorway, passing through Denton and Hyde before ending near Mottram. From the end of the motorway traffic can either follow the A628 road or the A57 road further east to the M1 motorway and Sheffield.

Before the motorway reaches its eastern terminal at Hattersley/Mottram roundabout (where traffic continues along the A57 into Longdendale), there are the stub &#x27;ski ramps&#x27; where the motorway would have continued eastwards, as there are at the western end.

==History==
In 1965, the Ministry of Transport asked Halcrow to report on a route selected by the county surveyor of Cheshire and this led, in stages, to the development of the design to partial urban and partial rural motorway standards. There was a public inquiry in 1967. The first section to be opened was the &#x27;M67 Hyde Bypass&#x27; which was constructed between 1975 and 1978. M67 Denton Relief Road to the west was constructed between 1978 and 1981. These schemes are connected by a viaduct over the River Tame and Peak Forest Canal.

===M67 Manchester to Sheffield motorway===
In 1967, at the time of the first public inquiry there were discussions regarding an extension of the motorway across the Peak District National Park. It was to provide a second motorway link across the Pennines to the south of the planned M62 and avoid the Snake and Woodhead passes, which are often closed in snowy weather.

The full proposed route was to start from Manchester city centre at what was the A57(M) motorway eastern terminal roundabout (now a flyover for the A635, constructed in 1995), following the line of the A57 Hyde Road through the inner suburbs of Ardwick, Gorton and Debdale Park. Large-scale demolition took place along the line of the motorway (which is still evident today), tied in with the widening of the Belle Vue and Reddish Lane junctions.

From there the intended route follows the present-day M67, skirting Hyde and Denton. Upon reaching Mottram, the route passed the village to the north (through a tunnel), then crossed Mottram Moor to skirt Hollingworth through the Etherow valley floor. The motorway would then have run around the side of Bottoms Reservoir to reach Hadfield, from which the trackbed of the Woodhead railway line (the former intercity route between Manchester and Sheffield, now closed) was to have been followed up the Longdendale valley to Woodhead. At Woodhead, the route would have diverged, with one carriageway entering the Woodhead Rail Tunnel (now disused) and the other rising on a sweeping viaduct to go over a realigned Woodhead Pass.

Beyond the Pennine watershed, the motorway would have continued on a new alignment past the villages of Langsett and Midhopestones, before meeting the route of the current Stocksbridge bypass.
The Stocksbridge bypass would have been constructed on its present alignment and continued directly onto the M1 at junction 35a.

Another part of the originally planned &quot;M67&quot; exists in South Yorkshire, as the A616 Stocksbridge bypass, which opened in 1989. As there was no certainty that the whole M67 scheme would be completed by this time, the then government decided that the scheme would not be built with motorway characteristics, but as a single carriageway with crawler lanes.

==Proposed developments==
===A57/A628 Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle Bypass===

Plans for a road at the eastern end of the M67 passing to the north of the current A628 route past Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwistle were cancelled in 2009 following four adjournments of the public inquiry due to inconsistencies in the official traffic models.

===Manchester to Sheffield Peak District Tunnel===
After the cancellation of the Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle Bypass, there are now proposals to build a tunnel underneath the Peak District to link Manchester and Sheffield, with some of the proposed tunnel routes using the existing M67 route to link the M60 and M1 motorways. In 2017, this was later scaled down into a partially tunnelled route along the existing Woodhead Pass due to rising costs.

<text>The University of Nebraska system is the public university system of the U.S. state of Nebraska. Founded in 1869 with one campus in Lincoln, the system has four university campuses, a two-year technical agriculture college, and a high school.

==Schools==
* The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is the state&#x27;s flagship, land-grant university with a Carnegie Research I/Research-Extensive status. It was founded in 1869 as the University of Nebraska.
* The University of Nebraska Omaha is the state&#x27;s public urban university. It was founded in 1908 as Omaha University, and joined the University of Nebraska system in 1968.
* The University of Nebraska at Kearney is a university especially focused on undergraduate education, in a smaller setting. It was founded in 1905 as the Nebraska State Normal School at Kearney, and joined the University of Nebraska system in 1991.
* The University of Nebraska Medical Center is located in Omaha and was founded as the Omaha Medical College, a private medical school, in 1880. It became a part of the University of Nebraska system in 1902. 
* The Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture is located in Curtis, Nebraska and was founded in 1965. It is a two-year degree-granting institution managed by the University of Nebraska pursuant to a 1994 agreement.
* The University of Nebraska High School is an online high school headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska. It was founded in 1929 as Independent Study High School.

==Nebraska Institutes==
The University of Nebraska has four interdisciplinary, University-wide institutes operating across the University of Nebraska system.
* Buffett Early Childhood Institute - Samuel J. Meisels, founding executive director
* National Strategic Research Institute - Robert Hinson, USAF Lt. General (ret.), founding executive director
* Robert B. Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute - Peter G. McCornick, executive director
* Rural Futures Institute - Chuck Schroeder, founding executive director

Two of NU&#x27;s campuses also partner in the Peter Kiewit Institute, a facility in Omaha, Nebraska that houses academic programs from both the University of Nebraska-Lincoln&#x27;s College of Engineering and the University of Nebraska at Omaha&#x27;s College of Information Science and Technology.

==NU Online Education==
Online Worldwide is the virtual connection point to more than 100 online degrees, certificates, endorsements, and minors offered by the four campuses of the University of Nebraska system.

University of Nebraska High School is an accredited, university-based online high school. The online college preparatory curriculum allows students to earn high school credit or a diploma from anywhere around the world.

==History==
On February 11, 1857, a group of citizens received permission from the Nebraska Territorial Legislature to found the University of Nebraska at Saratoga, Nebraska. However, when they did not complete the task of meeting in Saratoga and establishing a campus within one year they lost their permission to charter.

Today&#x27;s University of Nebraska was founded in 1869 in Lincoln, Nebraska. For the first 99 years of its existence, the University was synonymous with the Lincoln campus. In 1902, Omaha Medical College became part of the University of Nebraska system. The University reorganized into its present form in 1968 when it took control of the municipal University of Omaha, which became the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Kearney State College, the University of Nebraska at Kearney, became the fourth member of the University of Nebraska system in 1991.

==Governance==
===Board of Regents===
The University of Nebraska system is governed by the board of regents, a twelve-member panel consisting of eight voting members and a non-voting student body president from each campus. Voting members are elected by district to six-year terms; elections are held in even-numbered years. The board of regents meets at Varner Hall on East Campus and supervises the operation, expenditures, and tuition rates of each university in the system.

The Board of Regents was established as a constitutional office in the 1875 Nebraska State Constitution. At the time, the regents were elected in partisan statewide elections to six-year terms. In 1917, the legislature made the regental elections nonpartisan, and in 1920, voters ratified a constitutional amendment that provided for the election of the regents by district. The regents were elected from the state&#x27;s congressional districts from 1923 to 1949, and from the Nebraska Supreme Court districts from 1949 to 1971. Beginning in 1971, the regents were elected in separate districts drawn by the state legislature, which are redrawn after each census. In 1974, voters approved a constitutional amendment that added student members to the board of regents as nonvoting members.

===President===

The president of the University of Nebraska system is appointed by and reports to the board of regents. The position was created in 1968 when the Municipal University of Omaha and the University of Nebraska Medical Center were absorbed into the University of Nebraska to create a state-wide system. Clifford M. Hardin was the first president and Ronald Roskens was the longest-tenured. Jeffrey P. Gold has been serving as Nebraska&#x27;s president since July 1, 2024.

Following the dissolution of her marriage, Haven moved to San Francisco, where she worked early on as a nurse&#x27;s aide, exotic dancer, massage parlor girl and eventually as a stripper. While working in one of the strip clubs, she met porn star Bonnie Holiday and moved in with her and Holiday&#x27;s boyfriend.

She was introduced to the sex industry through a role in a film called &quot;Lady Freaks&quot; in 1973 starring Holiday. Annette Haven went on to work in nearly 100 porn movies, including &quot;Desires Within Young Girls&quot; (1977), &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot; (1977), &quot;A Coming of Angels&quot; (1977), &quot;Obsessed&quot; (1977), &quot;Sex World&quot; (1977), &quot;Dracula Sucks&quot; (aka &quot;Lust At First Bite&quot;) (1978), &quot;Maraschino Cherry&quot; (1978), &quot;Charli&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Grafenberg Spot&quot; (1985).

Haven had a mainstream cameo role in Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;10&quot;. Subsequently, she was considered to play the lead female role in &quot;Body Double&quot;, but the role went to Melanie Griffith because Brian De Palma believed she gave a better dramatic screen test than Haven. Afterwards she became one of the director&#x27;s consultants for &quot;Body Double&quot; and was a coach for Griffith. Before filming &quot;Body Double&quot; De Palma commented, &quot;I&#x27;m already thinking of casting. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any good young porno stars out here, but the older ones—Annette Haven, Seka—some of them can really act. And Annette Haven has a terrific body.&quot;

Haven is a member of the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame.

<text>Paleoethnobotany (also spelled palaeoethnobotany), or archaeobotany, is the study of past human-plant interactions through the recovery and analysis of ancient plant remains. Both terms are synonymous, though paleoethnobotany (from the Greek words &quot;palaios&quot; [παλαιός] meaning ancient, &quot;ethnos&quot; [έθνος] meaning race or ethnicity, and &quot;votano&quot; [βότανο] meaning plants) is generally used in North America and acknowledges the contribution that ethnographic studies have made towards our current understanding of ancient plant exploitation practices, while the term archaeobotany (from the Greek words &quot;archaios&quot; [αρχαίος] meaning ancient and &quot;votano&quot;) is preferred in Europe and emphasizes the discipline&#x27;s role within archaeology.

As a field of study, paleoethnobotany is a subfield of environmental archaeology. It involves the investigation of both ancient environments and human activities related to those environments, as well as an understanding of how the two co-evolved. Plant remains recovered from ancient sediments within the landscape or at archaeological sites serve as the primary evidence for various research avenues within paleoethnobotany, such as the origins of plant domestication, the development of agriculture, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, subsistence strategies, paleodiets, economic structures, and more.

Paleoethnobotanical studies are divided into two categories: those concerning the Old World (Eurasia and Africa) and those that pertain to the New World (the Americas). While this division has an inherent geographical distinction to it, it also reflects the differences in the flora of the two separate areas. For example, maize only occurs in the New World, while olives only occur in the Old World. Within this broad division, paleoethnobotanists tend to further focus their studies on specific regions, such as the Near East or the Mediterranean, since regional differences in the types of recovered plant remains also exist.

== Macrobotanical vs. microbotanical remains ==

Plant remains recovered from ancient sediments or archaeological sites are generally referred to as either ‘macrobotanicals’ or ‘microbotanicals.’

Macrobotanical remains are vegetative parts of plants, such as seeds, leaves, stems and chaff, as well as wood and charcoal that can either be observed with the naked eye or the with the use of a low-powered microscope.

Microbotanical remains consist of microscopic parts or components of plants, such as pollen grains, phytoliths and starch granules, that require the use of a high-powered microscope in order to see them.

The study of seeds, wood/charcoal, pollen, phytoliths and starches all require separate training, as slightly different techniques are employed for their processing and analysis. Paleoethnobotanists generally specialize in the study of a single type of macrobotanical or microbotanical remain, though they are familiar with the study of other types and can sometimes even specialize in more than one.

== History ==
The state of Paleoethnobotany as a discipline today stems from a long history of development that spans more than two hundred years. Its current form is the product of steady progression by all aspects of the field, including methodology, analysis and research.

=== Initial work ===
The study of ancient plant remains began in the 19th century as a result of chance encounters with desiccated and waterlogged material at archaeological sites. In Europe, the first analyses of plant macrofossils were conducted by the botanist C. Kunth (1826) on desiccated remains from Egyptian tombs and O. Heer (1866) on waterlogged specimens from lakeside villages in Switzerland, after which point archaeological plant remains became of interest and continued to be periodically studied from different European countries until the mid-20th century. In North America, the first analysis of plant remains occurred slightly later and did not generate the same interest in this type of archaeological evidence until the 1930s when Gilmore (1931) and Jones (1936) analysed desiccated material from rock shelters in the American Southwest. All these early studies, in both Europe and North America, largely focused on the simple identification of the plant remains in order to produce a list of the recovered taxa.

=== Establishment of the field ===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Paleoethnobotany gained significant recognition as a field of archaeological research with two significant events: the publication of the Star Carr excavations in the UK and the recovery of plant material from archaeological sites in the Near East. Both convinced the archaeological community of the importance of studying plant remains by demonstrating their potential contribution to the discipline; the former produced a detailed paleoenvironmental reconstruction that was integral to the archaeological interpretation of the site and the latter yielded the first evidence for plant domestication, which allowed for a fuller understanding of the archaeological record. Thereafter, the recovery and analysis of plant remains received greater attention as a part of archaeological investigations. In 1968, the International Work Group for Palaeoethnobotany (IWGP) was founded.

=== Expansion and growth ===
With the rise of Processual archaeology, the field of Paleoethnobotany began to grow significantly. The implementation in the 1970s of a new recovery method, called flotation, allowed archaeologists to begin systematically searching for plant macrofossils at every type of archaeological site. As a result, there was a sudden influx of material for archaeobotanical study, as carbonized and mineralized plant remains were becoming readily recovered from archaeological contexts. Increased emphasis on scientific analyses also renewed interest in the study of plant microbotanicals, such as phytoliths (1970s) and starches (1980s), while later advances in computational technology during the 1990s facilitated the application of software programs as tools for quantitative analysis. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the publication of several seminal volumes about Paleoethnobotany that demonstrated the sound theoretical framework in which the discipline operates. And finally, the popularization of Post-Processual archaeology in the 1990s, helped broaden the range of research topics addressed by paleoethnobotanists, for example &#x27;food-related gender roles&#x27;.

=== Current state of the field ===

Paleoethnobotany is a discipline that is ever evolving, even up to the present day. Since the 1990s, the field has continued to gain a better understanding of the processes responsible for creating plant assemblages in the archaeological record and to refine its analytical and methodological approaches accordingly. For example, current studies have become much more interdisciplinary, utilizing various lines of investigation in order to gain a fuller picture of the past plant economies. Research avenues also continue to explore new topics pertaining to ancient human-plant interactions, such as the potential use of plant remains in relation to their mnemonic or sensory properties. Interest in plant remains surged in the 2000s alongside the improvement of stable isotope analysis and its application to archaeology, including the potential to illuminate the intensity of agricultural labor, resilience, and long-term social and economic changes.

Archaeobotany had not been used extensively in Australia until recently. In 2018 a study of the Karnatukul site in the Little Sandy Desert of Western Australia showed evidence of continuous human habitation for around 50,000 years, by analysing wattle and other plant items.

== Modes of preservation ==
As organic matter, plant remains generally decay over time due to microbial activity. In order to be recovered in the archaeological record, therefore, plant material must be subject to specific environmental conditions or cultural contexts that prevent their natural degradation. Plant macrofossils recovered as paleoenvironmental, or archaeological specimens result from four main modes of preservation: 

# Carbonized (Charred): Plant remains can survive in the archaeological record when they have been converted into charcoal through exposure to fire under low-oxygen conditions. Charred organic material is more resistant to deterioration, since it is only susceptible to chemical breakdown, which takes a long time (Weiner 2010). Due to the essential use of fire for many anthropogenic activities, carbonized remains constitute the most common type of plant macrofossil recovered from archaeological sites. This mode of preservation, however, tends to be biased towards plant remains that come into direct contact with fire for cooking or fuel purposes, as well as those that are more robust, such as cereal grains and nut shells.
# Waterlogged: Preservation of plant material can also occur when it is deposited in permanently wet, anoxic conditions, because the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity. This mode of preservation can occur in deep archaeological features, such as wells, and in lakebed or riverbed sediments adjacent to settlements. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved as waterlogged material, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative matter.
# Desiccated: Another mode by which plant material can be preserved is desiccation, which only occurs in very arid environments, such as deserts, where the absence of water limits decomposition of organic matter. Desiccated plant remains are a rarer recovery, but an incredibly important source of archaeological information, since all types of plant remains can survive, even very delicate vegetative attributes, such as onion skins and crocus stigmas (saffron), as well as woven textiles, bunches of flowers and entire fruits.
# Mineralized: Plant material can also preserve in the archaeological record when its soft organic tissues are completely replaced by inorganic minerals. There are two types of mineralization processes. The first, &#x27;biomineralization,&#x27; occurs when certain plant remains, such as the fruits of &quot;Celtis sp.&quot; (hackberry) or nutlets of the Boraginaceae family, naturally produce increased amounts of calcium carbonate or silica throughout their growth, resulting in calcified or silicified specimens. The second, &#x27;replacement mineralization,&#x27; occurs when plant remains absorb precipitating minerals present in the sediment or organic matter in which they are buried. This mode of preservation by mineralization only occurs under specific depositional conditions, usually involving a high presence of phosphate. Mineralized plant remains, therefore, are most commonly recovered from middens and latrine pits – contexts which often yield plant remains that have passed through the digestive track, such as spices, grape pips and fig seeds. The mineralization of plant material can also occur when remains are deposited alongside metal artefacts, especially those made of bronze or iron. In this circumstance, the soft organic tissues are replaced by the leaching of corrosion products that form over time on the metal objects.
In addition to the above-mentioned modes of preservation, plant remains can also be occasionally preserved in a frozen state or as impressions. The former occurs quite rarely, but a famous example comes from Ötzi, the 5,500 year old mummy found frozen in the French Alps, whose stomach contents revealed the plant and meat components of his last meal. The latter occurs more regularly, though plant impressions do not actually preserve the macrobotanical remains themselves, but rather their negative imprints in pliable materials like clay, mudbrick or plaster. Impressions often result from the deliberate employment of plant material for decorative or technological purposes (such as the use of leaves to create patterning on ceramics or the use of chaff as temper in the construction of mudbricks), however, they can also derive from accidental inclusions. Identification of plant impressions is achieved by creating a silicone cast of the imprints and studying them under the microscope.

== Recovery methods ==
In order to study ancient plant macrobotanical material, Paleoethnobotanists employ a variety of recovery strategies that involve different sampling and processing techniques depending on the kind of research questions they are addressing, the type of plant macrofossils they are expecting to recover and the location from which they are taking samples.

=== Sampling ===
In general, there are four different types of sampling methods that can be used for the recovery of plant macrofossils from an archaeological site:

* Full Coverage sampling: involves taking at least one sample from all contexts and features 
* Judgement sampling: entails the sampling of only areas and features most likely to yield ancient plant remains, such as a hearth
* Random sampling: consists of taking random samples either arbitrarily or via a grid system 
* Systematic sampling: involves taking samples at set intervals during excavation
Each sampling method has its own pros and cons and for this reason, paleoethnobotanists sometimes implement more than one sampling method at a single site. In general, &quot;Systematic&quot; or &quot;Full Coverage&quot; sampling is always recommended whenever possible. The practicalities of excavation, however, and/or the type of archaeological site under investigation sometimes limit their use and &quot;Judgment&quot; sampling tends to occur more often than not.

Aside from sampling methods, there are also different types of samples that can be collected, for which the standard, recommended sample size is ~20L for dry sites and 1-5L for waterlogged sites.

* Point/Spot samples: consist of sediment collected only from a particular location
* Pinch samples: consist of small amounts of sediment that are collected from across the whole context and combined in one bag
* Column samples: consist of sediment collected from the different stratigraphic layers of a column of sediment that was deliberately left unexcavated

These different types of samples again serve different research aims. For example, &quot;Point/Spot&quot; samples can reveal the spatial differentiation of food-related activities, &quot;Pinch&quot; samples are representative of all activities associated with a specific context, and &quot;Column&quot; samples can show change or variation or time.

The sampling methods and types of samples used for the recovery of microbotanical remains (namely, pollen, phytoliths, and starches) follows virtually the same practices as outline above, with only some minor differences. First, the required sample size is much smaller: ~50g (a couple of tablespoons) of sediment for each type of microfossil analysis. Secondly, artefacts, such as stone tools and ceramics, can also be sampled for microbotanicals. And third, control samples from unexcavated areas in and around the site should always be collected for analytical purposes.

=== Processing ===
There are several different techniques for the processing of sediment samples. The technique a paleoethnobotanist chooses depends entirely upon the type of plant macrobotanical remains they expect to recover.

* Dry Screening involves pouring sediment samples through a nest of sieves, usually ranging from 5–0.5 mm. This processing technique is often employed as a means of recovering desiccated plant remains, since the use of water can weaken or damage this type of macrofossil and even accelerate its decomposition.
* Wet Screening is most often used for waterlogged contexts. It follows the same basic principle as dry screening, expect water is gently sprayed onto the sediment once it has been pour into the nest of sieves in order to help it break up and pass down through the various mesh sizes.
* The Wash-Over technique was developed in the UK as an effective way of processing waterlogged samples. The sediment is poured into a bucket with water and gently agitated by hand. When the sediment has effectively broken up and the organic matter is suspended, all the contents from the bucket, expect for the heavy inorganic matter at the bottom, is carefully poured out onto a 300μ mesh. The bucket is then emptied and the organic matter carefully rinsed from the mesh back into the bucket. More water is added before the contents are again poured out through a nest of sieves.
* Flotation is the most common processing technique employed for the recovery of carbonized plant remains. It uses water as a mechanism for separating charred and organic material from the sediment matrix, by capitalizing on their buoyancy properties.  When a sediment sample is slowly added to agitated water, the stones, sand, shells and other heavy material within the sediment sink to the bottom (&quot;heavy fraction&quot; or &quot;heavy residue)&quot;, while the charred and organic material, which is less dense, float to the surface (&quot;light fraction&quot; or &quot;flot&quot;). This floating material can either be scooped off or spilled over into a fine-mesh sieve (usually ~300 μm). Both the heavy and light fractions are then left to dry before being examined for archaeological remains. Plant macrofossils are mostly contained within the light fraction, though some denser specimens, such as pulses or mineralized grape endosperms, are also sometimes found in the heavy fraction. Thus, each fraction must be sorted to extract all plant material. A microscope is used in order to aid the sorting of the light fractions, while heavy fractions are sorted with the naked eye. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets or by machine-assistance, which circulates the water through a series of tanks by means of a pump. Small-scale, manual flotation can also be used in the laboratory on waterlogged samples.

Microbotanical remains (namely, pollen, phytoliths and starches) require completely different processing procedures in order to extract specimens from the sediment matrix. These procedures can be quite expensive, as they involve various chemical solutions, and are always carried out in the laboratory.

== Analysis ==
Analysis is the key step in paleoethnobotanical studies that makes the interpretation of ancient plant remains possible. The quality of identifications and the use of different quantification methods are essential factors that influence the depth and breadth of interpretative results.

=== Identification ===

Plant macrofossils are analyzed under a low-powered stereomicroscope. The morphological features of different specimens, such as size, shape and surface decoration, are compared with images of modern plant material in identification literature, such as seed atlases, as well as real examples of modern plant material from reference collections, in order to make identifications. Based on the type of macrofossils and their level of preservation, identifications are made to various taxonomic levels, mostly family, genus and species. These taxonomic levels reflect varying degrees of identification specificity: families comprise big groups of similar type plants; genera make up smaller groups of more closely related plants within each family, and species consist of the different individual plants within each genus. Poor preservation, however, may require the creation of broader identification categories, such as ‘nutshell’ or ‘cereal grain’, while extremely good preservation and/or the application of analytical technology, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Morphometric Analysis, may allow even more precise identification down to subspecies or variety level

Desiccated and waterlogged macrofossils often have a very similar appearance with modern plant material, since their modes of preservation do not directly affect the remains. As a result, fragile seed features, such as anthers or wings, and occasionally even color, can be preserved, allowing for very precise identifications of this material. The high temperatures involved in the carbonization of plant remains, however, can sometimes cause the damage to or loss of plant macrofossil features. The analysis of charred plant material, therefore, often includes several family- or genus-level identifications, as well as some specimen categories. Mineralized plant macrofossils can range in preservation from detailed copies to rough casts depending on depositional conditions and the kind of replacing mineral. This type of macrofossil can easily be mistaken for stones by the untrained eye.

Microbotanical remains follow the same identification principles, but require a high-powered (greater magnification) microscope with transmitted or polarized lighting. Starch and phytolith identifications are also subject to limitations, in terms of taxonomical specificity, based on the state of current reference material for comparison and considerable overlap in specimen morphologies.

=== Quantification ===

After identification, paleoethnobotanists provide absolute counts for all plant macrofossils recovered in each individual sample. These counts constitute the raw analytical data and serve as the basis for any further quantitative methods that may be applied. Initially, paleoethnobotanical studies mostly involved a qualitative assessment of the plant remains at an archaeological site (presence and absence), but the application of simple statistical methods (non-multivariate) followed shortly thereafter. The use of more complex statistics (multivariate), however, is a more recent development. In general, simple statistics allow for observations concerning specimen values across space and over time, while more complex statistics facilitate the recognition of patterning within an assemblage, as well as the presentation of large datasets. The application of different statistical techniques depends on the quantity of material available. Complex statistics require the recovery of a large number of specimens (usually around 150 from each sample involved in this type of quantitative analysis), whereas simple statistics can be applied regardless of the amount of recovered specimens – though obviously, the more specimens, the more effective the results.

The quantification of microbotanical remains differs slightly from that of macrobotanical remains, mostly due to the high numbers of microbotanical specimens that are usually present in samples. As a result, relative/percentage occurrence sums are usually employed in the quantification of microbotanical remains instead of absolute taxa counts.

== Research results ==
The work done in Paleoethnobotany is constantly furthering over understanding of ancient plant exploitation practices. The results are disseminated in digital archives, archaeological excavation reports and at academic conferences, as well as in books and journals related to archaeology, anthropology, plant history, paleoecology, and social sciences. In addition to the use of plants as food, such as paleodiet, subsistence strategies and agriculture, Paleoethnobotany has illuminated many other ancient uses for plants (some examples provided below, though there are many more):

* Production of bread/pastry in the widest sense
* Production of beverages 
* Extraction of oils and dyes
* Agricultural regimes (irrigation, manuring, and sowing)
* Economic practices (production, storage, and trade)
* Building materials
* Fuel
* Symbolic use in ritual activities

<text>Subjective [[idealism]], or empirical idealism or immaterialism, is a form of philosophical monism that holds that only minds and mental contents exist. It entails and is generally identified or associated with , the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism; it is the contrary of eliminative materialism, the doctrine that all or some classes of mental phenomena (such as emotions, beliefs, or desires) do not exist, but are sheer illusions.

==Overview==

Subjective idealism is a fusion of phenomenalism or empiricism, which confers special status upon the immediately perceived, with idealism, which confers special status upon the mental. Idealism denies the knowability or existence of the non-mental, while phenomenalism serves to restrict the mental to the empirical. Subjective idealism thus identifies its mental reality with the world of ordinary experience, and does not comment on whether this reality is &quot;divine&quot; in some way as pantheism does, nor comment on whether this reality is a fundamentally unified whole as does absolute idealism. This form of idealism is &quot;subjective&quot; not because it denies that there is an objective reality, but because it asserts that this reality is completely dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.

The earliest thinkers identifiable as subjective idealists were certain members of the Yogācāra school of Indian Buddhism, who reduced the world of experience to a stream of subjective perceptions. Subjective idealism made its mark in Europe in the 18th-century writings of George Berkeley, who argued that the idea of mind-independent reality is incoherent, concluding that the world consists of the minds of humans and of God. Subsequent writers have continuously grappled with Berkeley&#x27;s skeptical arguments. Immanuel Kant responded by rejecting Berkeley&#x27;s immaterialism and replacing it with transcendental idealism, which views the mind-independent world as existent but incognizable in itself. Since Kant, true immaterialism has remained a rarity, but is survived by partly overlapping movements such as phenomenalism, subjectivism, and perspectivism.

Hegel rejected Kant&#x27;s immaterialism, demeaning it to a &quot;reduction of the facts of consciousness to a purely personal world.&quot;

==History==

Thinkers such as Plato, Plotinus and Augustine of Hippo anticipated idealism&#x27;s thesis with their views of the inferior or derivative reality of matter. However, these Platonists did not make Berkeley&#x27;s turn toward subjectivity. Plato helped anticipate these ideas by creating an analogy about people living in a cave which explained his point of view. His view was that there are different types of reality. He explains this with his cave analogy which contains people tied up only seeing shadows their whole life. Once they go outside, they see a completely different reality, but lose sight of the one they saw before. This sets up the idea of Berkley&#x27;s theory of immaterialism because it shows how people can be exposed to the same world but still see things differently. This introduces the idea of objective versus subjective which is how Berkeley attempts to prove that matter does not exist. Indeed, Plato rationalistically condemned sense-experience, whereas subjective idealism presupposed empiricism and the irreducible reality of sense data. A more subjectivist methodology could be found in the Pyrrhonists&#x27; emphasis on the world of appearance, but their skepticism precluded the drawing of any ontological conclusions from the epistemic primacy of phenomena.

The first mature articulations of idealism arise in Yogacarin thinkers such as the 7th-century epistemologist Dharmakīrti, who identified ultimate reality with sense-perception. The most famous proponent of subjective idealism in the Western world was the 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley, whose popularity eclipsed his contemporary and fellow Anglican philosopher Arthur Collier - who perhaps preceded him in a refutation of material existence, or as he says a &quot;denial of an external world&quot; - although Berkeley&#x27;s term for his theory was &quot;immaterialism&quot;. From Berkeley&#x27;s point of view of subjective idealism, the material world does not exist, and the phenomenal world is dependent on humans. Hence the fundamental idea of this philosophical system (as represented by Berkeley or Mach) is that things are complexes of ideas or sensations, and only subjects and objects of perceptions exist. &quot;Esse est percipi&quot; is Berkeley&#x27;s whole argument summarized into a couple words. It means &quot;to be is to be perceived&quot;. This summarized his argument because he based his point around the fact that things exist if they are all understood and seen the same way. As Berkeley wrote: &quot;for the Existence of an Idea consists in being perceived&quot;. This would separate everything as objective and subjective. Matter falls into the subjective category because everyone perceives matter differently, which means matter is not real. This loops back to the core of his argument which says that in order for anything to be real, it must be interpreted the same way by everyone. 

Berkeley believes that all material is a construction by the human mind. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy his argument is: &quot;(1) We perceive ordinary objects (houses, mountains, etc.). (2) We perceive only ideas. Therefore, (3) Ordinary objects are ideas.&quot;

Berkeley makes such a radical claim that matter does not exist as a reaction to the materialists. He says &quot;if there were external bodies, we couldn’t possibly come to know this; and if there weren’t, we might have the very same reasons to think there were that we have now&quot;: &quot;a thinking being might, without the help of external bodies, be affected with the same series of sensations or ideas as you have.&quot; Berkeley believes that people cannot know that what they think to be matter is not simply a creation in their mind.

People have contested that premise (2) is false, claiming that people don&#x27;t perceive ideas but instead, &quot;distinguishing two sorts of perception&quot; they perceive objects and then have ideas about them, effectively cutting down the equality. This might seem to obviously be the case, but in fact it is contestable. Many psychologists believe that what people actually perceive are tools, impediments, and threats. The famous gorilla psychological study, where people were asked to watch a video and count the number of basketball passes made, showed that people do not actually see everything in front of them, even a gorilla that marches across a high school gym. Similarly, it is believed that human reaction to snakes is faster than it should physically be if it were consciously driven. Therefore, it is not unfair to say that objects go straight to the mind.
Berkeley even pointed out that it is not obvious how motion in the physical world could translate to emotion in the mind. Even the materialists had difficulty explaining this; Locke believed that to explain the transfer from physical object to mental image one must &quot;attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our Maker.&quot; Newton&#x27;s laws of physics say that all movement comes from the inverse change in another motion, and materialists believe that what humans do is fundamentally move their parts. If so how you explain the correlation between objects existing, and the completely other realm of regular ideas is not obvious. The fact &quot;that the existence of matter does not help to explain the occurrence of our ideas&quot; seems to Berkeley to undermine the reason for believing in matter at all. If the materialists have no way of knowing that matter exists, it seems best to not assume that it exists.

According to Berkeley, an object has real being as long as it is perceived by a mind. God, being omniscient, perceives everything perceivable, thus all real beings exist in the mind of God. However, it is also evident that each of us has free will and understanding upon self-reflection, and our senses and ideas suggest that other people also possess these qualities as well. According to Berkeley there is no material universe, in fact he has absolutely no idea what that could possibly mean. To theorize about a universe that is composed of insensible matter is not a sensible thing to do. This matters because there is absolutely no positive account for a material universe, only speculation about things that are by fiat outside of our minds.

Berkeley&#x27;s assessment of immaterialism was criticized by Samuel Johnson, as recorded by James Boswell. Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed &quot;I refute it &quot;thus&quot;!&quot; while kicking a rock with &quot;mighty force&quot;. This episode is alluded to by Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, chapter three. Reflecting on the &quot;ineluctable modality of the visible&quot;, Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson&#x27;s refutation and carries it forth in conjunction with Aristotle&#x27;s expositions on the nature of the senses as described in &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;. Aristotle held that while visual perception suffered a compromised authenticity because it passed through the diaphanous liquid of the inner eye before being observed, sound and the experience of hearing were not thus similarly diluted. Dedalus experiments with the concept in the development of his aesthetic ideal.

==Criticism==

Bertrand Russell&#x27;s popular 1912 book &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot; highlights Berkeley&#x27;s tautological premise for advancing idealism;

:&quot;If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind&#x27;s power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by &#x27;in the mind&#x27; the same as by &#x27;before the mind&#x27;, i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley&#x27;s argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that &#x27;ideas&#x27;-i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever. Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed.&quot;

The Australian philosopher David Stove harshly criticized philosophical idealism, arguing that it rests on what he called &quot;the worst argument in the world&quot;. Stove claims that Berkeley tried to derive a non-tautological conclusion from tautological reasoning. He argued that in Berkeley&#x27;s case the fallacy is not obvious and this is because one premise is ambiguous between one meaning which is tautological and another which, Stove argues, is logically equivalent to the conclusion.

Alan Musgrave argues that conceptual idealists compound their mistakes with use/mention confusions;

:Santa Claus the person does not exist.
:&quot;Santa Claus&quot; the name/concept/fairy tale does exist because adults tell children this every Christmas season (the distinction is highlighted by using quotation-marks when referring only to the name and not the object)

and proliferation of hyphenated entities such as &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; (Immanuel Kant), &quot;things-as-interacted-by-us&quot; (Arthur Fine), &quot;table-of-commonsense&quot; and &quot;table-of-physics&quot; (Arthur Eddington) which are &quot;warning signs&quot; for conceptual idealism according to Musgrave because they allegedly do not exist but only highlight the numerous ways in which people come to know the world. This argument does not take into account the issues pertaining to hermeneutics, especially at the backdrop of analytic philosophy. Musgrave criticized Richard Rorty and &quot;postmodernist&quot; philosophy in general for confusion of use and mention.

John Searle, criticizing some versions of idealism, summarizes two important arguments for subjective idealism. The first is based on our perception of reality:

:(1) &quot;All we have access to in perception are the contents of our own experience&quot; and

:(2) &quot;The only epistemic basis for claims about the external world are our perceptual experiences&quot;

therefore;

:(3) &quot;The only reality we can meaningfully speak of is that of perceptual experience&quot;

Whilst agreeing with (2) Searle argues that (1) is false and points out that (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). The second argument runs as follows;

:&quot;Premise: Any cognitive state occurs as part of a set of cognitive states and within a cognitive system&quot;

:&quot;Conclusion 1: It is impossible to get outside all cognitive states and systems to survey the relationships between them and the reality they cognize&quot;

:&quot;Conclusion 2: There is no cognition of any reality that exists independently of cognition&quot;

Searle contends that &quot;Conclusion 2&quot; does not follow from the premises.

==In fiction==
Subjective idealism is featured prominently in the Norwegian novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;, in which &quot;Sophie&#x27;s world&quot; exists in fact only in the pages of a book.

A parable of subjective idealism can be found in Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; short story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, which specifically mentions Berkeley.

<text>Auburn University (AU or Auburn) is a public land-grant research university in Auburn, Alabama, United States. With more than 26,800 undergraduate students, over 6,100 post-graduate students, and a total enrollment of more than 34,000 students with 1,330 faculty members, Auburn is the second-largest university in Alabama. It is one of the state&#x27;s two flagship public universities. The university is one of 146 U.S. universities classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;.

Auburn was chartered in 1856, as East Alabama Male College, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1872, under the Morrill Act, it became the state&#x27;s first land-grant university and was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. In 1892, it became the first four-year coeducational school in Alabama and in 1899 was renamed Alabama Polytechnic Institute. In 1960, its name was changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.

In 1967, the Alabama Legislature chartered an additional campus in Montgomery which is governed by the Auburn University Board of Trustees as a member of the Auburn University system.

==History==

The Alabama Legislature chartered the institution as the East Alabama Male College on February 1, 1856, coming under the guidance of the Methodist Church in 1859. Its first president was Reverend William J. Sasnett, and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.

Auburn&#x27;s early history is inextricably linked with the Civil War and the Reconstruction-era South. Classes were held in &quot;Old Main&quot; until the college was closed due to the war when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the Confederate Army, and &quot;Old Main&quot; served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.

To commemorate Auburn&#x27;s contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from Selma, Alabama, was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of the Delta chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. It sits today on the lawn next to Samford Hall.

===Post-Civil War===
The school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of Alabama for financial reasons. The Reconstruction-era Alabama government placed the school under the provisions of the Morrill Act as a land-grant institution, the first in the South to be established separately from the state university. This act provided for 240,000 acres (971 km) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.

Under the act&#x27;s provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.

The university&#x27;s original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of William Leroy Broun, who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun&#x27;s influence.

On October 1, 1918, nearly all of API&#x27;s able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the United States Army for short-lived military careers on campus. The student soldiers numbered 878, according to API President Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended World War I. API struggled through the Great Depression, having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President Bradford Knapp. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered but then faced new conditions caused by World War II.

As war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The U.S. Office of Education asked all American engineering schools to join in a &quot;crash&quot; program to produce what was often called &quot;instant engineers&quot;. API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became Engineering, Science, and Management War Training (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn&#x27;s Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults – including many women – these courses helped fill the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals.

During the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, 32,000 troops attended the university in some manner. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their GI Bill offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.

===Name change to Auburn===
Recognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University.

===Civil rights era to present===
Auburn University was racially segregated prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A. Franklin, who had to sue the university to gain admission to the graduate school and who was denied a degree after he completed his master&#x27;s thesis; he was belatedly awarded the master&#x27;s in history in 2020. The first degree granted to an African-American was in 1967. According to Auburn University&#x27;s Office of Institutional Research and Assessment, African-Americans comprise 1,828 of the university&#x27;s 24,864 undergraduates (7.35%) and 49 of the 1,192 full-time faculty (4.1%) . AU has decreased its African American faculty percentage from 4.3% in 2003 to 4.1% today, since the settlement of legal challenges to the underrepresentation of African Americans in AU&#x27;s faculty in 2006.

In 2018, the university began a speaker series to promote racial diversity named Critical Conversations.

==Campus==
The Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.

Several erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.
The current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.

In recent years, the university has been replacing or renovating older buildings. Completed in August 2017, the Mell Classroom Building was attached to the Ralph Brown Draughon Library, offering a new flexible learning space. A brand-new 89,000 square foot building for the school of nursing was also finished in 2017; it features active learning classrooms, skill and simulation labs, and public gathering areas. In 2019, two significant projects were finished: the Brown Kopel Engineering Student Achievement Center, which includes classrooms, student study spaces, a wind-tunnel laboratory, meeting spaces, and departmental spaces for professional development and labor relations; and the opening of a new Graduate Business Building, which includes flexible classrooms and lecture halls, student study pods, team areas, and offices for the college&#x27;s MBA program. Most recent developments include an $83 million academic classroom and laboratory complex with a seating capacity of 2,000 students in 20 adaptable classrooms and laboratories, six EASL classrooms, and five lecture halls.A new 800-seat central dining hall with reservable dining and study areas as well as retail options is also part of the complex. Completed in August 2022, the Tony and Libba Rane Culinary Science Center combines instructional and laboratory space with operational food venues and hotel spaces in which students can obtain experiential real-world training. The new college of education building, scheduled to open in 2024 and located on the site of the former Hill dorms, is one of the projects currently under construction. This building will include collaborative classrooms, instructional laboratories, up-to-date technology, and administrative spaces for faculty and staff. The new 265,000 square foot $200 million STEM+Ag Complex will replace older STEM-related and agricultural science facilities on the former Hill site. It will offer new space for cutting-edge wet and dry research labs, collaboration spaces, shared lab support spaces, and instructional labs for six departments. The complex is scheduled to open in 2025. The STEM + Ag complex represents Auburn&#x27;s largest-ever investment in academic facilities.

By 2018 this had risen to $778.2 million, thanks to a $500 million &quot;It Begins at Auburn&quot; growth campaign began in 2005, the most successful in school history. By 2017, the university raised over $1.2 billion in the &quot;Because This is Auburn&quot; campaign, being the first university in Alabama to raise over $1 billion as well as the most successful fundraising campaign in school history.

Auburn University is ranked 6th most LGBTQ-unfriendly campus by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; in its 2020 rankings of the 386 American campuses that it surveys.

Auburn&#x27;s College of Architecture pioneered the nation&#x27;s first interior architecture degree program; its dual degree Architecture &amp; Interior Architecture degree was the first in the nation. Of special mention is the School&#x27;s Rural Studio program, founded by the late Samuel Mockbee.

The Samuel Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation&#x27;s largest 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. In 2001, Samuel L. Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication and Auburn alumnus, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree. Auburn was also the only school to offer a degree in the 2000s for Polymer &amp; Fiber Engineering, combining medical research, advanced composites, sustainability and recycling and other disciplines into an advanced material science offering for undergraduates through doctorate degrees. Despite significant corporate sponsorship, such as from Under Armour, the undergraduate offering of the department was disbanded and absorbed into other departments leaving options for higher degrees.
Auburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.

Auburn&#x27;s Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the &quot;Journal of Applied Econometrics&quot;. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th).

The Ludwig von Mises Institute (LvMI) offices were once located in the business department of Auburn University, and the LvMI continues to work with the university on many levels.

ROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps with the latter being the only one in Alabama. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, Carl Epting Mundy Jr., who served as Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.

In addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master&#x27;s degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals Hugh Shelton and Richard Myers, served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).

Auburn has graduated six astronauts (including T.K. Mattingly of Apollo 13 fame) and one current and one former director of the Kennedy Space Center. 1972 Auburn Mechanical Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the &quot;space race&quot; in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.

Auburn University owns and operates the Auburn University Regional Airport, providing flight education and fuel, maintenance, and airplane storage. The Auburn University Aviation Department is fully certified by the FAA as an Air Agency with examining authority for private, commercial, instrument, and multiengine courses. In April 2015, Auburn University received the nation&#x27;s first FAA approval to operate a new Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight School as part of the Auburn University Aviation Center. The College of Business&#x27;s Department of Aviation Management and Supply Chain Management is the only program in the country to hold dual accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI). Created over 65 years ago, Auburn&#x27;s flight program is also the second oldest university flight program in the United States.

The Old Rotation on campus is the oldest continuous agricultural experiment in the Southeast, and third oldest in the United States, dating from 1896. In addition, the work of David Bransby on the use of switchgrass as a biofuel was the source of its mention in the 2006 State of the Union Address.

The university recently began a Master of Real Estate Development program. one of the few in the Southeast. The program has filled a void of professional real estate education in Alabama.

&quot;Modern Healthcare&quot; ranked Auburn University&#x27;s Physicians Executive M.B.A. (PEMBA) program in the College of Business ninth in the nation among all degree programs for physician executives, according to the Journal&#x27;s May 2006 issue. Among M.B.A. programs tailored specifically for physicians, AU&#x27;s program is ranked second.

Auburn&#x27;s literary journal, the &quot;Southern Humanities Review&quot;, has been published at the university by members of the English faculty, graduate students in English, and the Southern Humanities Council since 1967. Auburn hosts the &quot;Encyclopedia of Alabama&quot;″s editorial offices and servers and the Alabama Humanities Foundation holds copyright to the encyclopedia&#x27;s original content.

==Student life==
=== Campus events ===
In 2019, Auburn was ranked first by &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; list of happiest students on college campuses thanks in part to its wide variety of campus activities and events.

Campus activities and events begin with orientation and training sessions for new Auburn students. Auburn offers two orientation programs, Camp War Eagle and Successfully Orienting Students. Camp War Eagle is offered to incoming freshmen and guests of incoming freshmen, helping familiarize students with the orientation to college life and Auburn. Successfully Orienting Students is designed for college students transferring into Auburn from another academic institution. First-year Auburn students also have the opportunity to participate in seminars with other first-year students and learning communities.

Other prominent campus events and activities include Welcome Week and Hey Day. Welcome Week is multi-day series of programs taking place over the first days of each semester period designed to welcome both new and returning students. Hey Day is one of Auburn&#x27;s most longstanding traditions, dating back to World War II, where the entire campus community wears nametags and greet one another.

Only 11% of Auburn students qualify for a federal Pell grant, even though Alabama has one of the highest poverty rates in the United States. Less than 5% of the student population is Black, even though 30% of the college-age population in Alabama is Black.

=== Dining ===
In 2021, Auburn opened the $26 million Central Dining Hall spanning 48,000 square feet with capacity for more than 800 seats and eight different meal stations. Outside of the Central Dining Hall, Auburn students have many options including other dining halls in Foy Hall and The Village residential neighborhood. Students may also visit restaurant chains like Chick-fil-A and Starbucks in addition to locally owned and operated food trucks at various locations across campus.

All Auburn students have access to meal plans, accessible to use at all on-campus dining locations. Students may choose to purchase plans with meal swipes for access to campus dining dollars or opt for a plan with more declining balance to use at standalone restaurants and food trucks, or a combination of both.

Campus dining utilizes the popular mobile food ordering application, Grubhub.

Auburn campus dining is engaged in sustainability practices such as minimizing food waste and reducing food packaging, and campus dining also participates in a local campus community garden for both sustainability and freshness.

Auburn works at addressing and solving student food insecurity. All Auburn students have access to the Campus Food Pantry in the event students face food insecurity.

===Housing===
Auburn&#x27;s initial campus master plan was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. in 1929. For most of the early history of Auburn, boarding houses and barracks made up most of the student housing. Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It was not until the Great Depression that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.

Auburn&#x27;s on-campus student housing consists of 30 residence halls in nine residential neighborhoods, housing a total of 4,800 residents. On-campus residents are served by 79 resident assistants, 13 housing ambassadors and many other graduate assistants and full-time university employees.
* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the Works Progress Administration and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Quad is located in the center of campus and primarily consists of double-occupancy rooms connected to a bathroom.
* The Hill currently consists of six and houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed with gender-separated floors. The Hill residence halls are configured similarly to The Quad, primarily consisting of double-occupancy rooms connected to a bathroom.
* The Village was constructed in 2009 and consists eight four-story buildings to accommodate 1,500 residents. Three buildings in The Village house members of Auburn&#x27;s Panhellenic sororities. Most Village rooms are designed as suites with four single bedrooms, two bathrooms and a furnished common living and dining area with a kitchenette.
*Cambridge Hall is a five-story residence hall at Auburn University housing 300 undergraduate students, located in close proximity to Rane Culinary Science Center currently under construction. Cambridge rooms are configured to be double occupancy rooms with open closets and a shared bathroom.
* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a five-story residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. Most South Donahue suites include two separate bedrooms and private bathrooms, also equipped with a shared living room and kitchenette. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.
*160 Ross is a luxury apartment community designed to combine the benefits of off campus living and on-campus housing. 160 Ross rooms are configured to be four bedroom/four bathroom or two bedroom/two bathroom apartments with a wide array of amenities and benefits.

=== Health, wellness and recreation ===
Auburn&#x27;s campus recreation center features a five-story cardio tower, one-third of a mile indoor running track, basketball courts, an outdoor leisure pool, cardio and fitness zones, a rock climbing wall, weight training areas and outdoor recreation spaces. Athletic Business named the 240,000 square foot facility as one of its 2014 Facilities of Merit.

Auburn&#x27;s currently has more than 20 club sports, open to all Auburn University students without affiliation to the NCAA. The club sport programs range from sports like basketball and volleyball to clay shooting and water skiing. Auburn also offers Intramural Sports like flag football in a team setting.

Auburn students also have access to a wide array of wellness programs, including a fully functional on-campus Medical Clinic featuring 40 exam rooms, digitized x-rays and cutting edge lab equipment. The university&#x27;s Student Counseling and Psychological Services office, fully accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS) to provide health counseling, is also housed within the Medical Clinic. The Medical Clinic is also home to a student pharmacy, a women&#x27;s health center, a massage therapy center and a chiropractic care center.

=== Student clubs and organizations ===
Some organizations on campus housed within the university&#x27;s Student Involvement office include the Student Government Association, University Program Council, Emerge Student Leadership Program, Black Student Union, International Student Organization and the Graduate Student Council. Auburn&#x27;s Student Involvement office also houses a number of service organizations such as Auburn University Dance Marathon, The Big Event, Beat Bama Food Drive and more.

&quot;The Auburn Plainsman&quot; is a student-run newspaper covering Auburn University and the Auburn community. The paper is the most decorated student publication, receiving more National Pacemaker Awards, handed out by the Associated Collegiate Press, than any other student news organization. As of 2021, The Auburn Plainsman is primarily an online publication, though some special editions are still carried out in print.

Other student media organizations include Eagle Eye TV station, WEGL 91.1 FM radio, &quot;The Circle&quot; literary magazine and the &quot;Glomerata&quot; yearbook.

More than 350 students are members of the Auburn University Marching Band, the 2004 recipient of the Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy, the most prestigious collegiate marching band award. The band features all components of a traditional marching band in addition to a majorette, dance and flag line as well as the Tiger Eyes visual ensemble.

===Greek life===

Auburn&#x27;s total Greek population is 7,541 members, or about 33.6% of all undergraduate students, as of Fall 2020.

Auburn&#x27;s Greek system lagged behind most of the nation&#x27;s public college Greek systems with full integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority, happening in 2001. Integration of Auburn&#x27;s historically white fraternities took place in the 1990s. Since the early 2000s, several non-white students have been initiated into historically white Greek organizations at Auburn every year. In 2018, an African-American student became the first person of color president of a historically white Greek organization on campus. Only Auburn&#x27;s historically white fraternities have traditional Greek houses.

=== Student services and resources ===
Auburn students have access to a wide variety of resources for various needs and concerns. As it pertains to academics, students have access to college-specific academic advisors, peer tutoring study partners, supplemental instruction sessions and The Miller Writing Center. If needed, students may also request academic assistance through the Office of Accessibility to best accommodate their respective learning needs.

The Auburn Office of Inclusion and Diversity is designed to help fulfill a university&#x27;s strategic planning mission of &quot;[establishing] diversity as a core value at Auburn University.&quot; This office manages student excellence programs, education and training sessions, a cross cultural center and women&#x27;s initiatives. Auburn also has an ongoing Presidential Task Force for Opportunity and Equity designed to address disparities in recruitment and retention, as well as implement campus-wide diversity, equity and inclusion training.

The Auburn Cares office assesses the needs of students in the event of a crisis, emergency or unexpected difficulty. The office guides students through such a crisis while helping connect them with appropriate resources, assistance and action plans.

The Veterans Resource Center serves all military-affiliated students at Auburn. The resource center connects student veterans with one another while providing them with additional opportunities and resources to successfully transition into the Auburn community.

==Athletics==

Auburn University&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Tigers, and are a member of the NCAA at the Division I FBS level as well as being a member of the 16-member Southeastern Conference (SEC). &quot;War Eagle&quot; is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 26 intercollegiate national championships (including 21 NCAA Championships), which includes five football, eight men&#x27;s swimming and diving, five women&#x27;s swimming and diving, six equestrian, one women&#x27;s outdoor track and field, and one men&#x27;s golf. Auburn has also won a total of 70 Southeastern Conference championships, including 51 men&#x27;s titles and 19 women&#x27;s titles. Auburn&#x27;s colors of orange and blue were chosen by George Petrie, Auburn&#x27;s first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the University of Virginia.

===Football===


Auburn named Hugh Freeze as the new football head coach in November 2022. Past coaches include George Petrie, John Heisman, Mike Donahue, Jack Meagher, Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan, Pat Dye, Terry Bowden, Tommy Tuberville, Gene Chizik, and Gus Malzahn.

Auburn played its first game in 1892 against the University of Georgia at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the Deep South. Auburn&#x27;s first perfect season came in 1913, when the Tigers went 8–0, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers&#x27; first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth Bacardi Bowl played in Havana, Cuba. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival Alabama each year in a game known as the Iron Bowl.

Three Auburn players, Pat Sullivan in 1971, Bo Jackson in 1985, and Cam Newton in 2010, have won the Heisman Trophy. The Trophy&#x27;s namesake, John Heisman, coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, Georgia Tech and Clemson) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn&#x27;s Jordan–Hare Stadium has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA .

Auburn went 11–0 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13–0 record winning the SEC championship, the school&#x27;s first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback Jason Campbell, running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, and cornerback Carlos Rogers, all subsequently drafted in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft. The team&#x27;s new offensive coordinator, Al Borges, led the team to use the west coast style offense which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, Southern California and Oklahoma, that played in the BCS championship game.

Prior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that Gene Chizik had been hired as Auburn&#x27;s new head coach. Coach Gene Chizik then hired Gus Malzahn as the Tigers&#x27; new offensive coordinator.

In 2010, Auburn defeated Oregon 22–19 in the 2011 BCS National Championship Game to secure the school&#x27;s second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14–0 record, including comeback wins over Clemson, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24–0 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28–27 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the Iron Bowl. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56–17 in the 2010 SEC Championship Game, claiming the school&#x27;s eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton, and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner Nick Fairley. In Malzahn&#x27;s first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game to the Florida State Seminoles 34–31 in Pasadena, California.

In addition to the 1913, 1957, and 2010 championships, Auburn&#x27;s 1914, 1958, 1983, 1993, and 2004 teams have also been recognized as national champions by various ranking organizations.
===Swimming and diving===

In the last decade under head coaches David Marsh, Richard Quick and co-head coach Brett Hawke, Auburn&#x27;s swimming and diving program has become preeminent in the SEC and nationally, with consecutive NCAA championships for both the men and women in 2003 and 2004, then again in 2006 and 2007. Since 1982, only eight teams have claimed national championships in women&#x27;s swimming and diving. Auburn and Georgia each won nine straight (five Auburn, four Georgia) between 1999 and 2007. The men won their fifth consecutive national title in 2007, and the women also won the national title, in their case for the second straight year. The Auburn women have now won five national championships in the last six years. , the Auburn men have won the SEC Championship fifteen out of the last sixteen years, including the last thirteen in a row, and also won eight NCAA national championships (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). AU swimmers have represented the U.S. and several other countries in recent Olympic Games. Auburn&#x27;s most famous swimmer is Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, and also Brazilian César Cielo Filho, bronze(100m freestyle) and gold medal(50m freestyle) at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. As the most successful female Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry (swimming for her home country of Zimbabwe) who won gold, silver, and bronze medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. While the football team is far more well known nationally and in the media, Auburn swimming and diving is the most dominant athletics program for the university.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The Auburn men&#x27;s basketball team has enjoyed off-and-on success over the years. Its best known player is Charles Barkley. Other professional basketball players from Auburn are John Mengelt, Rex Fredicks, Eddie Johnson, Mike Mitchell, Chuck Person, Chris Morris, Wesley Person, Chris Porter, Mamadou N&#x27;diaye, Jamison Brewer, Moochie Norris, Marquis Daniels, and Pat Burke.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===

The Auburn University women&#x27;s basketball team has been consistently competitive both nationally and within the SEC. Despite playing in the same conference as perennial powerhouse Tennessee and other competitive programs such as LSU, Georgia, and Vanderbilt, Auburn has won four regular season SEC championships and four SEC Tournament championships. AU has made sixteen appearances in the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament and only once, in their first appearance in 1982, have the Tigers lost in the first round. Auburn played in three consecutive national championship games from 1988 to 1990 and won the WNIT in 2003. When Coach Joe Ciampi retired at the end of the 2003–2004 season, Auburn hired former Purdue and U.S. National and Olympic team head coach, Nell Fortner. Standout former Auburn players include Ruthie Bolton, Vickie Orr, Carolyn Jones, Chantel Tremitiere, Lauretta Freeman, Monique Morehouse, and DeWanna Bonner.

===Baseball===
Auburn Baseball has won six SEC championships, three SEC Tournament championships, appeared in sixteen NCAA Regionals and reached the College World Series (CWS) four times. After a disappointing 2003–2004 season, former Auburn assistant coach Tom Slater was named head coach. He was replaced in 2008 by John Pawlowski. Samford Stadium-Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park is considered one of the finest facilities in college baseball and has a seating capacity of 4,096, not including lawn areas. In addition to Bo Jackson, Auburn has supplied several other players to Major League Baseball, including Frank Thomas, Gregg Olson, Scott Sullivan, Tim Hudson, Mark Bellhorn, Jack Baker, Terry Leach, Josh Hancock, Gabe Gross, Steven Register, Trey Wingenter, David Ross and Josh Donaldson.

===Women&#x27;s golf===
Auburn&#x27;s women&#x27;s golf team has risen to be extremely competitive in the NCAA in recent years. Since 1999, they hold an 854–167–13 (.826 win percentage) record. The team has been in five NCAA finals and finished second in 2002, then third in 2005. The program has a total of seven SEC Championships (1989, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2009). The seven titles is third all time for women&#x27;s golf. In October 2005, Auburn was named the #3 team nationally out of 229 total teams since 1999 by &quot;GolfWeek&quot; magazine. Auburn&#x27;s highest finish in the NCAA tournament was a tie for second in 2002.

===Track and field===
The Auburn women&#x27;s track and field team won its first national title in 2006 at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, scoring 57 points to win over the University of Southern California, which finished second with 38.5 points. Auburn posted All-American performances in nine events, including two individual national champions and three second-place finishers, and broke two school records during the four-day event.

===Equestrian===
Auburn&#x27;s equestrian team captured the 2006 national championship, the first equestrian national championship in school history. Senior Kelly Gottfried and junior Whitney Kimble posted team-high scores in their respective divisions as the Auburn equestrian team clinched the overall national championship at the 2006 Varsity Equestrian Championships at the EXPO/New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2008, the Auburn equestrian team captured the 2008 Hunt Seat National Championship. Over fences riders finished 12–1–1 overall for the week. Auburn has also consistently been highly ranked in the Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Equestrian National Coaches Poll as well. The Auburn equestrian team most recently captured the 2019 national championship.

===Club sports===
At the conclusion of the 1980-1981 NCAA Wrestling season, Auburn University became the first SEC team to place Top 10 in the country. Coached by Ohio wrestling legend Tom Milkovich, Auburn claimed the SEC title en route to a historic season boasting three All-Americans and 6 NCAA qualifiers. However, with the emergence of Title IX and the decline of wrestling in the SEC, Auburn found itself without a varsity program after the 1980-81 season.

The Auburn University Rugby Football Club was founded in 1973. Auburn plays Division 1 college rugby in the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference against traditional SEC rivals such as Alabama and Georgia. Auburn rugby is one of only two club sports at Auburn with an endowment fund, resulting in the university allocating additional resources to rugby.

==Traditions==

Auburn University has many traditions including a creed, an alma mater, a fight song, a battle cry, a mascot and several notable game-day traditions including an eagle flying over the football field. The official colors are:
Auburn University&#x27;s fight song, &quot;War Eagle&quot;, was written in 1954 and 1955 by Robert Allen and Al Stillman. It was introduced at the beginning of the 1955 football season and served as the official fight song since.

===Auburn&#x27;s Eagles===
Auburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan–Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field. Auburn has two different species of eagle that have flown: the golden eagle and the bald eagle.

Spirit is the only bald eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit&#x27;s beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.

Tiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger&#x27;s first flight before an Auburn football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger&#x27;s career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.

===Aubie the Tiger===
Auburn&#x27;s mascot, Aubie the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus Hardin-Simmons College. Aubie was the creation of &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot; artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn&#x27;s football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23–2–1 home record and 63–16–2 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn&#x27;s official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest&#x27;s history, with ten.

===War Eagle chant theories===
During Auburn&#x27;s game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase &quot;War Eagle&quot; in turn.

During a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant &quot;war&quot;. At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student&#x27;s military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a &quot;War Eagle&quot;.

During a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle&#x27;s toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying &quot;bald eagle&quot;, while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling &quot;War Eagle&quot;, instead, leading to Auburn&#x27;s player, Lucy Hairston, to yell &quot;War Eagle&quot; at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.

After a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell &quot;War Eagle&quot;, when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.

===Toomer&#x27;s Corner===
The tradition of rolling Toomer&#x27;s Corner on Auburn&#x27;s campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer&#x27;s Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by &quot;USA Today&quot; as the &quot;Best Sports Tradition&quot;. In November 2010, following Auburn&#x27;s victory over the University of Alabama in the Iron Bowl, an Alabama supporter poisoned the large live oak trees at Toomer&#x27;s Corner using the herbicide Spike 80DF (tebuthiuron). The 83-85-year-old trees did not survive, and in the years since have been replaced several times (once following a fire in 2016) with the most recent replacements being planted in 2017.

<text>The Minnesota Fighting Pike were an Arena football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They joined the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1996 as an expansion team. The Fighting Pike were the first ever attempt at an arena/indoor football team in the state of Minnesota. The owner of the Fighting Pike was Tom Scallen. The Fighting Pike played at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The team colors were green and gold. In a 2012 AFL Poll, the Fighting Pike were voted as the 8th greatest nickname in AFL history.

==Franchise history==
In November 1995, the announced that they would be nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Pike&quot; and that Art Haege was named the team&#x27;s head coach.

During the team&#x27;s first tryout, Haege walked out, stating he was going &quot;Back to Iowa.&quot; The next day, Haege faxed in his resignation to team owner Tom Scallen.

The Pike were 0-7 at home, and the average attendance for the seven home games was 8,894.

The roster was full of players who had played at the University of Minnesota or other Minnesota colleges and universities. Tony Levine, a former Golden Gopher, joined the team and received 8 passes for a total of 83 yards and 1 touchdown. Former Gopher Rickey Foggie was the quarterback and he struggled adapting to the Arena Football League after many years in the Canadian Football League. Once during the season he was benched in favor of Southwest State&#x27;s Jeff Loots, who threw four interceptions in a game. Loots was playing on his third expansion team in three seasons. Another player from Southwest State was Alvin Ashley. The best-known ex-Pike is kicker Mike Vanderjagt, later a star in the CFL and NFL.

Ray Jauch was the head coach. He was assisted by John Coatta Jr. on offense and Frank Haege on defense.

The team&#x27;s lack of exposure or advertising was the key reason for the team&#x27;s folding at the end of the 1996 season. The team did not have a regional television deal to promote their games or have the games advertised in newspapers and other media.

The Pike&#x27;s final game of the season against the Memphis Pharaohs was played in Tupelo, Mississippi, because the Pharaohs had been evicted from their arena.

The Pike&#x27;s official mascot was a giant Pike named &quot;Tackle.&quot; He was known to &quot;dive&quot; into a promotional hot tub at the arena.

==Legacy==
In 2024, a revival of the Arena Football League brought it the Minnesota Myth, a team which played only two games (one at Target Center) before folding themselves.

<doc id="327949" wikidata="Q832225" url="?curid=327949" title="Charles II, Duke of Guelders">
<text>Charles II (9 November 1467 – 30 June 1538) was a member of the House of Egmond who ruled as Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen from 1492 until his death. He had a principal role in the Frisian peasant rebellion and the Guelders Wars.

==Life==
Charles was the son of Adolf of Egmond and Catherine of Bourbon. He born either at Arnhem or at Grave, Netherlands, and raised at the Burgundian court of Charles the Bold, who had bought the duchy of Guelders from Adolf of Egmond in 1473. Charles fought in several battles against the armies of Charles VIII of France, until he was captured in the Battle of Béthune in 1487.

King Maximilian subsequently managed to acquire the Burgundian lands for the Habsburgs by marriage. In 1492, the citizens of Guelders, disenchanted with Maximilian&#x27;s rule, ransomed Charles and recognized him as their Duke. As Duke his regent was his aunt Catherine. Charles was supported by the French King, but in 1505, Guelders was regained by King Maximilian&#x27;s son Philip the Handsome. Charles had to accompany Philip to Spain to attend Philip&#x27;s coronation as King of Castile but at Antwerp, Charles managed to escape. Shortly afterwards, Philip died in Spain and by July 1513 Charles had regained control over the whole of Guelders.
In his conflict with the Habsburgs, Charles also became a major player behind the scenes of the Frisian peasant rebellion and at first financially supported the rebel leader Pier Gerlofs Donia. After the tides turned against the rebels, Charles stopped his support and switched sides together with his military commander Maarten van Rossum.
In the Treaty of Gorinchem (1528), Emperor Charles, son of Philip the Handsome, proposed to recognize Charles of Egmond as Duke of Guelders under the condition that he would inherit the Duchy should the Duke die without issue. The Duke, who at the time did not have any children, delayed signing the treaty. Another battle ensued, after which the passage was removed from the treaty. In 1536 there was finally peace between Guelders and Burgundy with the Treaty of Grave.

Charles died at Arnhem, and is buried in the St. Eusebius Church there.

==Family==
In 1519, Charles married young Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1494–1572). The marriage remained childless. Charles however fathered several illegitimate children.

His only legitimate (twin) sister, Philippa (1467–1547), survived him and died during the reign of her great-grandson, Charles III, Duke of Lorraine (1543–1608).

<text>The University of Alabama (informally known as Alabama, UA, the Capstone, or Bama) is a public research university in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States. Established in 1820 and opened to students in 1831, the University of Alabama is the oldest and largest of the public universities in Alabama as well as the University of Alabama System. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

The university offers programs of study in 12 academic divisions leading to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. The only publicly supported law school in the state is at UA. Other academic programs unavailable elsewhere in Alabama include doctoral programs in anthropology, communication and information sciences, metallurgical engineering, music, Romance languages, and social work.

The school was a center of activity during the American Civil War and the civil rights movement. The University of Alabama varsity football program (nicknamed the &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;), inaugurated in 1892, ranks as one of the ten best in US history. In a 1913 speech, UA president George H. Denny extolled the university as the &quot; of the public school system in the state&quot;, thereby establishing the university&#x27;s current nickname, &quot;The Capstone&quot;. As of June 2024 UA has produced 65 Goldwater Scholars, 16 Rhodes Scholars, and 16 Truman Scholars.

==History==
===Establishment===

In 1818, the United States Congress authorized the newly created Alabama Territory to set aside a township for the establishment of a &quot;seminary of learning&quot;. When Alabama was admitted to the Union in 1819, a second township was added to the land grant, bringing it to a total of 46,000 acres (186 km2). The General Assembly of Alabama established the seminary on December 18, 1820, named it &quot;The University of the State of Alabama,&quot; and created a board of trustees to manage the construction and operation of the university. The site the board chose for the campus was, at the time, outside the city limits of the erstwhile state capital, Tuscaloosa. William Nichols, the architect of the Alabama State Capitol building in Tuscaloosa, was chosen to design the campus. Influenced by Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s plan at the University of Virginia, the Nichols-designed campus featured a wide, high domed Rotunda that served as the library and nucleus of the campus.

The university&#x27;s charter was presented to the first university president in the nave of Christ Episcopal Church. UA opened its doors to students on April 18, 1831, with Alva Woods as president. An academy-style institution during the antebellum period, the university emphasized the classics and the social and natural sciences. There were around 100 students per year at UA in the 1830s.
As the state and university matured, an active literary culture evolved on campus and in Tuscaloosa. UA had one of the largest libraries in the country on the eve of the Civil War with more than 7,000 volumes. There were several thriving literary societies, including the Erosophic and the Phi Beta Kappa societies, which often had lectures by such distinguished politicians and literary figures as United States Supreme Court justice John Archibald Campbell, novelist William Gilmore Simms, and professor Frederick Barnard. The addresses to those societies reveal a vibrant intellectual culture in Tuscaloosa; they also illustrate the proslavery ideas that were so central to the university and the state.

Discipline and student behavior were major issues at the university almost from the day it opened. Early presidents attempted to enforce strict rules regarding conduct. Students were prohibited from drinking, swearing, making unauthorized visits off-campus, or playing musical instruments for more than an hour at a time. Still, riots and gunfights were not uncommon. To combat the severe discipline problem, president Landon Garland received approval from the legislature in 1860 to transform the university into a military school.

===From the Civil War to World War II===
Many of the cadets who graduated from the school served as officers in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. As a consequence of that role, Union troops burned the campus on April 4, 1865, only five days before Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House. Despite a call to arms and defense by the student cadet corps, only four buildings survived the burning: the President&#x27;s Mansion (1841), Gorgas House (1829), Little Round House (1860), and Old Observatory (1844). The university reopened in 1871 and in 1880 Congress granted the university 40,000 acres (162 km2) of coal land in partial compensation for war damages.

The University of Alabama enrolled female students beginning in 1892. The board of trustees allowed female students largely because of Julia S. Tutwiler, with the conditions that they be over eighteen, and would be allowed to enter the sophomore class after completing their first year at another school and passing an exam. Ten women from Tutwiler&#x27;s Livingston school enrolled for the 1893 fall semester. By 1897, women were allowed to enroll as freshmen.

During World War II, UA was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. During this time the University of Alabama had extensions in other cities including Mobile; the University of South Alabama was opened in 1963 to replace that program.

===Racial integration===
Until the 1960s, the university admitted only white students (with one temporary exception). The practice of racial segregation was common in the American South at this time and the university barred all students of color from attending. The first attempt to integrate the university occurred in 1956 when Autherine Lucy successfully enrolled on February 3 as a graduate student in library sciences after she secured a court order preventing the university from rejecting her application on the basis of race. In the face of violent protests against her attendance, Lucy was suspended (and later outright expelled) three days later by the board of trustees on the basis of being unable to provide a safe learning environment for her. The university was not integrated until 1963 when Vivian Malone and James Hood registered for classes on June 11.
Governor George Wallace made his infamous &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot;, standing in the front entrance of Foster Auditorium in a symbolic attempt to stop Malone and Hood&#x27;s enrollment. When confronted by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and federal marshals sent in by U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Wallace stepped aside. President John F. Kennedy had called for the integration of the University of Alabama as well. Although Hood dropped out after two months, he returned and, in 1997, received his doctorate. Malone persisted in her studies and became the first African American to graduate from the university. In 2000, the university granted her a doctorate of humane letters. Autherine Lucy&#x27;s expulsion was rescinded in 1980, and she re-enrolled and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in 1992. Later in his life, Wallace apologized for his opposition to racial integration. In 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by rechristening the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting a clock tower – Autherine Lucy Clock Tower – in the plaza. In 2019 Autherine Lucy was presented with a doctorate of humane letters, and in 2022 the education building in which she sheltered during the protests was renamed in her honor.

===2011 tornado===

On April 27, 2011, Tuscaloosa was hit by a tornado rated EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, killing six students who lived off campus; the campus grounds were not damaged by the storm, but the university canceled the rest of the spring semester and postponed graduation because of damage to approximately 12% of the city, and the loss of life.

==Campus==

From a small campus of seven buildings in the wilderness on the main road between Tuscaloosa and Huntsville (now University Boulevard) in the 1830s, UA has grown to a massive campus in the heart of Tuscaloosa. There are 297 buildings on campus containing some of space. In 2010, the school added 168 acres to its campus by purchasing the land formerly belonging to Bryce Hospital. It also plans to acquire more land to accommodate the continuing growth of the enrollment.

The university maintains the University of Alabama Arboretum in eastern Tuscaloosa and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab on Dauphin Island, just off the Alabama Gulf Coast. In 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the university a College Sustainability Report Card grade of &quot;B+&quot;.

===Landmarks===
UA is home to several museums, cultural facilities and historical landmarks.

The Alabama Museum of Natural History at Smith Hall exhibits Alabama&#x27;s rich natural history. The oddest artifact there could be the Sylacauga meteorite, the largest known extraterrestrial object to strike a human being who survived. The Paul W. Bryant Museum houses memorabilia and exhibits on the history of UA athletic programs, most notably the tenure of football coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant. Athletic trophies and awards are displayed at the Mal Moore Athletic Facility. The Sarah Moody Gallery of Art at Garland Hall hosts revolving exhibitions of contemporary art, including from the university&#x27;s own permanent collection. The Jones Archaeological Museum at Moundville exhibits the history of Mississippian culture in Alabama.

Numerous historical landmarks dot the campus, including the President&#x27;s Mansion, Denny Chimes, Foster Auditorium (a National Historical Landmark), the Gorgas–Manly Historic District, and Maxwell Observatory.

A cemetery next to the Math and Science Education Building includes the graves of two enslaved persons who were owned by faculty members before the Civil War. Both men died in the 1840s, and their graves went unmarked until 2004.

Campus culture facilities include the Allen Bales Theatre, the Marion Gallaway Theatre, the English Building auditorium, and the Frank M. Moody Music Building, which houses the Tuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra as well as three resident choirs. The UA Opera Theatre performs in Bryant-Jordan Hall.

==Organization and administration==
The University of Alabama is an autonomous institution within the University of Alabama System and governed by the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama and headed by the chancellor of The University of Alabama. The state legislature created the board to govern the university&#x27;s operations. Its responsibilities include setting policy for the university, determining the university&#x27;s mission and scope, and assuming responsibility for the university to the public and the legislature. The board is self-perpetuating and composed of 15 members and two ex officio members. The Constitution of the State of Alabama dictates the board&#x27;s makeup and requires the board to include three members from the congressional district that contains the Tuscaloosa campus and two members from every other congressional district in Alabama. Board members are elected by the board and are confirmed by the Alabama State Senate.

The president of the University of Alabama is the principal executive officer of the university and is appointed by the chancellor with approval of the board of trustees. Stuart R. Bell became the 29th president on July 15, 2015.

===Faculty and Staff===
In fall 2023, UA employed 7,472 employees, including 2,117 instructional staff (faculty), 2,631 professional staff, and more than 2,600 office, clerical, technical and service staff.

===Colleges and academic divisions===

The College of Arts and Sciences is the university&#x27;s college for the liberal arts, fine arts, and sciences. It is the largest of the university&#x27;s 12 colleges, with approximately 7,900 undergraduate students and 1,100 graduate students. Most core curriculum classes and majors and minors are part of the college.

There are 11 other academic divisions at the University of Alabama (see the table above). Eight divisions (Arts and Sciences, Business, Communication and Information Sciences, Education, Engineering, Human Environmental Sciences, Nursing, and Social Work) grant undergraduate degrees. Degrees in those eight divisions at the master&#x27;s, specialist, and doctoral level are awarded through the Graduate School. The law school offers JD and LL.M. degree programs. The College of Community Health Sciences provides advanced studies in medicine and related disciplines and operates a family medicine residency program. Medical students are also trained in association with the University of Alabama School of Medicine, from which they receive their degree.

Founded in 1971 and merged into the College of Arts and Sciences in 1996, the New College&#x27;s stated objectives were to &quot;create an opportunity for a highly individualized education that enables students to draw from the resources of all University classes and faculty&quot; and to &quot;serve as an experimental unit with the expectation of exporting successful innovations to other sectors of the University&quot;. The college allows undergraduate students flexibility in choosing their curriculum while completing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in interdisciplinary studies. The &quot;New College Review&quot;, a non-fiction cultural journal, is written, edited, designed, and published by students.

===Endowment===
The University of Alabama System&#x27;s financial endowment was valued at $1.520 billion in the National Association of College and University Business Officers&#x27; (NACUBO) 2019 listings. UA&#x27;s portion of the system&#x27;s endowment was valued at $885.7 million in September 2015.

==Academics==
The university uses a standard academic calendar based on the semester system with two 15-week semesters and a summer term.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In fall 2021, Alabama received 42,421 applications for first-time freshman enrollment, from which 33,472 applications were accepted (78.9%) and 7,593 freshmen enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 22.7%. Alabama&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 88.6%, with 72.1% going on to graduate within six years.

The university started test-optional admissions with the Fall 2021 incoming class and has extended this through Fall 2024. Of the 63% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores, the middle 50 percent composite score was between 21 and 31. Of the 17% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores, the middle 50 percent composite scores were 1080–1370.

The University of Alabama is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored 189 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 223 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.


===Classification===
The University of Alabama is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. It is a large, four-year primarily residential university accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Full-time, four-year undergraduates comprise a large amount of the university enrollment. The undergraduate instructional program emphasizes professional programs of study as well as the liberal arts, and there is a high level of co-existence between the graduate and undergraduate program. The university has a very high level of research activity and has a &quot;comprehensive doctoral&quot; graduate instructional program in the liberal arts, humanities, social sciences. health sciences (medical school), and STEM fields.

UA began offering engineering classes in 1837. It was one of the first universities in the nation to offer an engineering degree. Over the past decade, UA has greatly expanded its science and engineering programs, in terms of numbers of students, faculty hired, and number and size of new academic/research facilities (almost one million in new square footage). UA&#x27;s College of Engineering enrolls more students than any other engineering program in the state as of 2016. UA&#x27;s freshman engineering classes have also had the highest average ACT score among all state of Alabama engineering programs for the last several years.

===Degrees conferred===
Ten of the university&#x27;s twelve academic units (see above) offer degree programs across a combined total of 117 areas of study. Two areas, economics and health care management, are offered jointly by separate units (Culverhouse College of Business and Arts &amp; Sciences for both), and one area (material science) is offered jointly by the other universities in the UA system.

UA conferred 9,105 degrees in the 2023–24 academic year, including 6,604 bachelor&#x27;s degrees (3,579 with Latin honors), 1,192 master&#x27;s degrees, 300 doctorates, 56 education specialist, and 153 professional degrees.

Latin honors are conferred on graduates completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree for the first time (including at other universities) with an overall grade point average of at least 3.5. &quot;Cum laude&quot; honors are conferred to graduates with a GPA of 3.5 or greater and less than 3.7 (without rounding). &quot;Magna cum laude&quot; honors are conferred with a GPA of 3.7 or greater and less than 3.9. &quot;Summa cum laude&quot; honors are conferred with a GPA of 3.9 or higher.

===Rankings===



In the 2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, UA was tied for 170th in the &quot;National Universities&quot; category (tied for 91st among &quot;Top Public Schools&quot;). Additionally, in the 2023 &quot;U.S. News&quot; rankings, the law school was tied for 35th in the nation, the business school was tied for 55th, the education school tied for 56th, and the engineering school was tied for 99th. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked the UA law school as the third-best public law school in the nation.

In August 2020, the UA Department of Advertising and Public Relations was named the Most Outstanding Education Program by PRWeek during the 2020 PRWeek Awards. It was the department&#x27;s ninth recognition as a finalist for the award and first selection as the top program.

As of 2021 &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked University of Alabama first in the nation as a party school and first for having lots of Greek life. The university was also ranked the eighth-most LGBT unfriendly school in the nation.

===Libraries===

The University of Alabama has 2.9 million document volumes, along with nearly 100,000 uncatalogued government documents in its collection; of these, 2.5 million volumes are held by the University Libraries. The University Libraries system has six separate libraries.

The Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, which sits on the Main Quad, is the oldest and largest of the university libraries. Gorgas Library holds the university&#x27;s collections in the humanities and social sciences, as well as the university&#x27;s depository of U.S. government documents. The library opened in 1939. A seven-story addition was built on the north side of the library in the 1970s.

The Angelo Bruno Business Library, in the Business Quad, is named after the co-founder of the Bruno&#x27;s grocery chain who gave the university $4 million to create a library focusing on commerce and business studies. Opened in 1994, the , three-story facility holds more than 170,000 volumes. Bruno Library also houses the Sloan Y. Bashinsky Sr. Computer Center.

The Eric and Sarah Rodgers Library for Science and Engineering, in the Science and Engineering Quad, is named after two popular, long-time professors of engineering and statistics, respectively. It opened in 1990, combining the Science Library collection in Lloyd Hall and the Engineering Library collection in the Mineral Industries Building (now known as H.M. Comer Hall). Rodgers Library was designed with help from IBM to incorporate the latest in informatics. McLure Education Library was founded in 1954 in a remodeled student union annex (across the street from the old Student Union, now Reese Phifer Hall) and named in 1974 after John Rankin McLure, the longtime dean of the College of Education. The William Stanley Hoole Special Collections Library, which holds the university&#x27;s collection of rare and historical documents and books, is in Mary Harmon Bryant Hall. The Library Annex holds seldom-used books and journals, as well as other volumes which need special protection, that would otherwise take up valuable space in the libraries.

Other libraries on campus are independent of the University Libraries. The Bounds Law Library, at the Law Center, holds more than 300,000 volumes. Established in 1978, the Health Sciences Library, at the University Medical Center, serves students at the College of Community Health Sciences. Its 20,000-volume collection includes clinical medicine, family practice, primary care, medical education, consumer health, and related health care topics. Located in Farah Hall (home of the Department of Geography) the Map Library and Place Names Research Center holds over 270,000 maps and 75,000 aerial photographs. The William E. Winter Reading Room of the College of Communication and Information Sciences is in Reese Phifer Hall and holds more than 10,000 volumes. The School of Social Work Reading Room in Little Hall contains around 200 volumes.

UA is one of the 126 members of the Association of Research Libraries, which yearly compiles internal rankings. In 2011, the University of Alabama ranked 56th among all criteria, a marked improvement over a 2003 ranking of 97th.

In the fall of 2011, the University of Alabama Trustees approved a resolution to expand Gorgas Library by , doubling the seating capacity from 1,139 to 2,278.

===Research===
In academic year 2014–2015, UA received $76 million in research contracts and grants. The Alabama International Trade Center and the Center for Advanced Public Safety are two research centers at UA.

The US Department of Homeland Security has selected The University of Alabama as a National Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance Education and Research.

==Student life==

===Student body===
In fall 2023, the university had an enrollment of 39,623 students, The record enrollment included 3,184 freshmen from Alabama, representing every county in the state. This marked UA&#x27;s fifth consecutive year with an in-state increase and the largest number of in-state freshmen since 2010. Alabama residents comprised 41.7% of the undergraduate student body; out-of-state residents comprised 58.3%.
In 2023, UA enrolled a record number of 1,142 National Merit Scholars, making UA one of the nation&#x27;s largest enrolling institutions of National Merit Scholars.

Kevin Carey, writing for The Atlantic, claimed that universities like UA &quot;give an effective 45 percent [admissions] bump to the children of the top 1 percent&quot;.

===Residential life===
Today nearly 30% of students live on campus, including over 90% of first-year freshmen.

===Student government===
The Student Government Association is the primary student advocacy organization at UA. The SGA is governed by the SGA Constitution and consists of a legislative branch, an executive branch and a judicial council.

====SGA controversy====
Since its founding in 1914, a secretive coalition of fraternities and sororities, commonly known as &quot;The Machine&quot;, has wielded enormous influence over the Student Government Association. Occurrences of harassment, intimidation, and even criminal activities aimed at opposition candidates have been reported. Many figures in local, state, and national politics have come out of the SGA at the University of Alabama. &quot;Esquire&quot; devoted its April 1992 cover story to an exposé of The Machine. The controversy led to the university disbanding the SGA in 1993, which was not undone until 1996. &quot;Machine&quot; fraternities and sororities have traditionally accepted only white pledges, with only one documented case of an African American student being offered entry, in 2003.

Controversy surrounding The Machine reemerged in August 2013, when sororities and fraternities were mobilized to elect two former SGA presidents, Cason Kirby and Lee Garrison, in closely contested municipal school board races. Before election day, questions about illegal voter registration were raised when evidence emerged that indicated eleven fraternity members fraudulently claimed to be living in a single house in one district. And on election day, leaked emails suggested that sorority/fraternity members may have been provided incentives to vote—including free drinks at local bars. As a result of possible voter fraud, Kirby&#x27;s opponent filed a lawsuit challenging the election results and University of Alabama faculty have questioned whether The Machine has corrupted the democratic process in the City of Tuscaloosa.

===Greek life===


UA has one of the largest Greek systems in the nation with over 12,000 active students.In 2023, 29% of male undergraduates were in university-sanctioned fraternities; 44% of female undergraduates were in university-sanctioned sororities.

Greek letter organizations (GLOs) first appeared at the university in 1847 when two men visiting from Yale University installed a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon. When DKE members began holding secret meetings in the old state capitol building that year, the administration strongly voiced its disapproval. Over a few more decades, 7 other fraternities appeared at UA: Alpha Delta Phi in 1850, Phi Gamma Delta in 1855, Sigma Alpha Epsilon in 1856 (this was the founding chapter), Kappa Sigma in 1867, Sigma Nu in 1874, Sigma Chi in 1876, and Phi Delta Theta in 1877. Anti-fraternity laws were imposed that year, but were lifted in the 1890s. Women at the university founded the Zeta chapter of Kappa Delta sorority in 1903. Alpha Delta Pi soon followed.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution newspaper reported male students receiving &quot;100 licks with a paddle&quot; by fellow male students multiple times back in the 1890s. Serious injuries in fraternities are a recurring issue.

In spring 2024, UA sanctioned 41 men&#x27;s GLOs, 26 women&#x27;s GLOs and four co-ed GLOs. Additionally, an unknown number of non-sanctioned GLOs existed. Four governing boards oversee the operations of the university-sanctioned GLOs: the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Alabama Panhellenic Association (NPC), the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the United Greek Council (UGC).

Despite having the first non-white student initiated into a historically white Greek organization on campus in 2000, notable segregation within Alabama&#x27;s Greek system has been a debated issue due to some other public college Greek systems becoming more integrated. John P. Hermann, a now-retired English professor, tried in the 1990s and 2000s to end what he referred to as &quot;taxpayer-supported segregation&quot;. Controversy erupted again in September 2013, when a story in the campus paper, &quot;The Crimson White&quot;, revealed that alumnae of Greek organizations had prevented a black student from being accepted in an all-white sorority. As a result, the Alabama Panhellenic Association allowed recruitment to continue through continuous open bidding. According to &quot;TIME&quot;, a deal that would allow black students to join historically white sororities was announced by the university as &quot;the first step toward ending more than a century of systematic segregation in the school&#x27;s sorority system&quot;.

In 1987, the Theta Sigma chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha became the first historically black Greek organization and only historically black sorority with a house on a Greek row. The Kappa Alpha chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is the first and only historically black fraternity with a house on fraternity row.

===Student media===
The &quot;Crimson White&quot; is the student-produced newspaper. The &quot;CW&quot; publishes continuously online and physical copies twice a week on Monday and Thursday during the academic year and weekly in the summer. The &quot;CW&quot; normally distributes 10,000 copies per publication. The &quot;CW&quot; won the Mark of Excellence Award for a second time in 2011 and a Gold Crown Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association for its spring 2011 issues. The Crimson White was also inducted into the College Media Hall of Fame for its coverage of the April 2011 tornado that caused massive damage in Tuscaloosa. Other UA student publications include the &quot;Blount Truth Literary Journal&quot;, &quot;Marr&#x27;s Field Journal&quot;, and &quot;Alice&quot;.

==Athletics and traditions==

The University of Alabama&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are known as the &quot;Alabama Crimson Tide&quot; (this name can be shortened to &quot;Alabama&quot;, the &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, or even the &quot;Tide&quot;). The nickname &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; originates from a 1907 football game versus Auburn University in Birmingham where, after a hard-fought game in torrential rain in which Auburn had been heavily favored to win, Alabama forced a tie. Writing about the game, one sportswriter described the offensive line as a &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, in reference to their jerseys, stained red from the wet dirt.

Alabama competes primarily in the Southeastern Conference of the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. Alabama fields men&#x27;s varsity teams in football, basketball, baseball, golf, cross country, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field. Women&#x27;s varsity teams are fielded in basketball, golf, cross country, gymnastics, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The athletic facilities on campus include Bryant–Denny Stadium, named after legendary football coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant and former UA President George Denny, and the 14,619-seat Coleman Coliseum. Alabama&#x27;s women&#x27;s rowing team competes in the Big 12 conference of the NCAA&#x27;s Division I.

Alabama maintains athletic rivalries with Auburn University and the University of Tennessee. The rivalry with Auburn is especially heated as it encompasses all sports. The annual Alabama-Auburn football game is nicknamed the &quot;Iron Bowl&quot;. While the rivalry with Tennessee is centered around football for the most part, there is no shortage of acrimony, especially given the recent history between then-UT Coach Phillip Fulmer and his relationship to the Tide&#x27;s most recent NCAA probation. There are also rivalries with Louisiana State University (football and baseball), University of Mississippi (football and men&#x27;s basketball), Mississippi State University (football, men&#x27;s basketball), University of Georgia (football, women&#x27;s gymnastics), and the University of Florida (football, softball).

===Football===

The University of Alabama football program, started in 1892, has won 30 SEC titles and 18 national championships (including 12 awarded by the Associated Press and 8 by the Coaches Poll). The program has compiled 36 10-win seasons and 59 bowl appearances, winning 32 of them – all NCAA records. Alabama has produced 18 hall-of-famers, 97 All-Americans honored 105 times, and 4 Heisman trophy winners (Mark Ingram II, Derrick Henry, DeVonta Smith, and Bryce Young).

The Crimson Tide&#x27;s current home venue, Bryant–Denny Stadium, opened in 1929 with a capacity of around 12,000. The most recent addition of the stadium was completed in 2010. An upper deck was added in the south end zone, completing the upper deck around the stadium. The current official capacity of the stadium is 101,821. The previous addition was the north end zone expansion, completed 2006. The Tide has also played many games, including the Iron Bowl against rival Auburn University, at Legion Field in Birmingham.
Nearly synonymous with Alabama football is legendary coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant whose record at the University of Alabama was 232–46–9. He led the Crimson Tide to 6 national titles in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979. Alabama&#x27;s most recent head football coach Nick Saban won a total of 7 national titles, including six at Alabama. Additionally, the 1966 team was the only one in the country to finish with a perfect record, but poll voters denied the 12–0 Alabama team the three-peat as Michigan State and Notre Dame played to a 10–10 tie in what was considered the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; and subsequently split the national championship.
In the 2020 season, Alabama earned a 13–0 record against an all-SEC schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic including winning the SEC Championship against Florida, the Rose Bowl against Notre Dame, and the National Championship game against Ohio State. Crimson Tide Wide Receiver DeVonta Smith was awarded the Heisman Trophy, the program&#x27;s third winner. In the 2021 season, the Crimson Tide would post a 13–2 record, including a 41–24 win over Georgia in the SEC championship game to win their 29th conference title. They would then go on to beat the Cincinnati Bearcats 27–6 in the Cotton Bowl, culminating in an eventual loss to Georgia in the National Championship by a score of 33–18. Along with a successful football season, Alabama&#x27;s starting quarterback, Bryce Young, won the Heisman trophy - becoming the fourth player from the university to win it, and the first quarterback from the university to win it.

===School songs===
The school&#x27;s fight song is &quot;Yea Alabama&quot;, written in 1926 by Lundy Sykes, then editor of the campus newspaper. Sykes composed the song in response to a contest by the Rammer Jammer to create a fight song following Alabama&#x27;s first Rose Bowl victory. The song as it is played by the Million Dollar Band during games and known to most people is simply the chorus of the larger song. The Alabama Alma Mater is set to the tune of &quot;Annie Lisle&quot;, a ballad written in the 1850s.

==Alumni==
University of Alabama graduates include 15 Rhodes Scholars, 59 Goldwater Scholars, and 16 Truman Scholars. UA graduates have also been named to the USA Today All-USA College Academic Team.

The University of Alabama is the alma mater of numerous notable people in politics, sports, business, entertainment, science, art, and literature. Among UA&#x27;s alumni are Mel Allen, Hugo Black, Bear Bryant, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, Harper Lee, Jim Nabors, Joe Namath, Joe Scarborough, Jimmy Wales. George Wallace, and E. O. Wilson.

<doc id="327959" wikidata="Q1525933" url="?curid=327959" title="Mississippi House of Representatives">
<text>The Mississippi House of Representatives is the lower house of the Mississippi Legislature, the lawmaking body of the U.S. state of Mississippi. According to the state constitution of 1890, it is to comprise no more than 122 members elected for four-year terms. To qualify as a member of the House candidates must be at least 21 years old, a resident of Mississippi for at least four years, and a resident in the district for at least two years. Elections are held the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

==Membership, qualifications, and apportionment==
Article 4, Section 36 of the Mississippi Constitution specifies that the state legislature must meet for 125 days every four years and 90 days in other years. The Mississippi House of Representatives has the authority to determine rules of its own proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and expel a member with a two-thirds vote of its membership. Bills must undergo three readings in each house, unless two-thirds of the house dispenses with the rules. They cannot be amended to a new purpose. Amendments to bills must be approved by both houses.

The governor has the power to veto legislation, but legislators can override the veto with a two-thirds decision. From 1890 to 2020, State representatives were authorized under the Mississippi Constitution to elect the Governor of Mississippi if no candidate had received 62 of the 122 electoral votes (one per district) and more than 50% of the popular vote. This occurred only once, in 1999, when Ronnie Musgrove had the most votes statewide, but was one electoral vote and 2936 votes (0.38%) shy of a majority: Musgrove was elected on the first ballot.

=== Leadership ===
The permanent position of Speaker pro tempore was established in a House vote on January 9, 1987. (It had been previously used in temporary situations if the Speaker was not available.) The Speaker Pro Tempore acts as Speaker in the Speaker&#x27;s absence. The Speaker Pro Tempore also serves ex officio as the Chair of the House Management Committee and as a member of the House Rules Committee. The current Speaker pro tempore is Republican Manly Barton.

== Salary ==
State representatives earn $23,500 per year.

==Current composition==
The following composition reflects the balance of power after the 2023 elections. Republicans secured a majority for the fourth time since 2011, the first year when Republicans won the majority of seats in the State House since 1870. The 2023 elections were marked by new leadership, as the past speaker Phillip Gunn retired, allowing his chief lieutenant, then-Speaker Pro Tempore Jason White to become the new speaker. The 2023 elections saw the seating of 25 new members.

State representatives are elected every four years by the qualified electors of the district for which they are running. Candidates are required to be at least 21 years of age and a resident of the state and district for which they are campaigning.

===List of members===
== List of speakers ==
The House has elected a speaker 63 times since 1817:

Before the position was made permanent, Buddie Newman served as Speaker pro tempore in three different stints between 1974 and 1975.

<text>Marie-Antoine Carême (; 8 June 1783 or 178412 January 1833), known as Antonin Carême, was a leading French chef of the early 19th century. 

Carême was born in Paris to a poor family and, when still a child, worked in a cheap restaurant. Later he became an apprentice to a leading Parisian &quot;pâtissier&quot; and quickly became known for his patisserie skills. He was deeply interested in architecture and was famous for his large &quot;pièces montées&quot;table decorations sculpted in sugar, depicting classical buildings. 

Working with leading chefs of the day, Carême extended his knowledge to cover all aspects of cooking, and became head chef to prominent people including Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, Tsar Alexander I of Russia and the Prince Regent in Britain. He codified and to some extent simplified classical French cookery, insisted on the finest and most expensive ingredients, and was regarded as the foremost chef of his day.

Carême wrote a series of books, lavishly illustrated, intended to pass his skills on to other chefs providing &quot;grande cuisine&quot; for the elite of French, and other, society. His influence continued after his death; his approach was continued by Jules Gouffé, Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard, reinvigorated by Auguste Escoffier and continued until it was overtaken by &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; in the second half of the 20th century.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Marie-Antoine Carême, known throughout his life as Antonin Carême, was born in Paris. The date of his birth cannot be authenticated and is disputed. The day and month are generally accepted as 8 June and the year as either 1783 or 1784. He was one of the many children of Marie-Jeanne Pascal and Jean-Gilbert Carême. The father was a construction worker, and the family lived in what Carême&#x27;s biographers Philippe Alexandre and Béatrix de l&#x27;Aulnoit call a a shackin what was then a poor part of Paris, near the rue du Bac and the rue de Sèvres. The French Revolution, starting in 1789, brought large-scale building work in Paris to a temporary halt, leaving Carême&#x27;s father struggling to feed the family. Carême went to work at an early age at a Parisian &quot;gargote&quot;the most basic and modest kind of restaurantthought to have been called . 

There have been two contrasting explanations of how this came about. By Carême&#x27;s account his father took him from home in the latter part of 1792 and sent him on his way alone, bidding him, with some touching words, to find a house that would take him in. In the words of a biographer who accepts this version of events:
More recent biographers have raised the possibility that this is a fanciful account, and that the family simply arranged for the &quot;gargotier&quot; to take the boy on. 

Accounts differ also about the next stage of Carême&#x27;s early years. Some biographers portray him as remaining at the &quot;gargote&quot; for more than five years, sweeping, washing, running errands, serving at table, and later, when he was considered mature enough, helping in the preparation of food. A conflicting account is that he left after a few months and moved to work for a baker in the rue Saint-Honoré, known as Père Ducrest. A contemporary recorded after Carême&#x27;s death that the boy was to be seen hurrying through the streets delivering his employer&#x27;s wares, before returning in the evening to Ducrest&#x27;s kitchen, where he slept. By this account, Carême was taught to read and write by Alexis Eymery (fr), the tutor of Ducrest&#x27;s children.

===Apprentice pâtissier===

Carême&#x27;s history is more reliably documented from 1798, when he began an apprenticeship at Sylvain Bailly&#x27;s patisserie-restaurant in the rue Vivienne. This was a step up, in career terms, as in post-revolutionary Paris, patisserie was the most prestigious branch of the culinary arts, and Bailly was among its most fêted practitioners, recommended by the influential &quot;Almanach des Gourmands&quot;, and with customers including the French foreign minister, Talleyrand. Bailly&#x27;s establishment was within a hundred paces of the fashionable and bustling Palais-Royal, and among Carême&#x27;s early tasks was to go there to encourage visitors to come to his employer&#x27;s restaurant. 

As an apprentice pastry-cook Carême began as a &quot;tourier&quot;, or turner, working the dough and repeatedly folding and rolling it to achieve the perfect puff pastry. He gained outstanding skill at this, and later put it to use in two confections with which he became particularly associated: the vol-au-vent and mille-feuille. One of Bailly&#x27;s most celebrated offerings was gâteau de plomb; Carême suggested how to make it lighter, and invented decorations with which to top it. He steadily rose to a position of responsibility. Bailly allowed him to take two afternoons off each week to visit the old royal library (subsequently the Bibliothèque nationale) across the road from the restaurant. He read voraciously − not only cookery books from other countries and different eras, but also works about his other great interest, architecture. Of the latter he later wrote:
Bailly was conscious of the need to innovate and attract new custom. He wanted eye-catching &quot;pièces montées&quot;elaborate displays of patisseriein his windows. Sculpting in sugar paste had been well known in the Ancien Régime but had become neglected after the revolution. Carême helped to revive the art, creating &quot;croquembouches&quot; and extravagant showpieces based on the ancient architecture he had studied in the library. He is credited with saying, later, &quot;The fine arts are five in number: music, painting, sculpture, poetry and architectureof which the principal branch is confectionery&quot;. His constructions, featuring Greek columns and temples, Chinese pagodas and Egyptian pyramids, attracted widespread attention and approbation. His enthusiasm, then and later in his career, sometimes led him to conflate in a single &quot;pièce montée&quot; details from several widely differing architectural eras and styles.

===Professional progress===
After staying with Bailly for three years Carême joined another celebrated pâtissier, Gendron, who was based in the rue des Petits-Champs. Carême liked working for Gendron, where his talents were appreciated by prestigious customers including the finance minister, the marquis de Barbé-Marbois. Carême benefited from the flexible conditions offered by Gendron, being allowed to freelance, catering for important banquets. In 1803 he opened his own shop in the rue de la Paix, trading there for a decade. In tandem with running his shop he built what one biographer calls &quot;an intermittent but spectacular career&quot;, first as a specialist pastry-cook and later as &quot;chef de cuisine&quot;, at the great imperial, social, and governmental banquets. In October 1808, Carême married Henriette Sophy Mahy de Chitenay. They had no children, although Carême later had a daughter, Marie, with another woman, Agatha Guichardet.

In addition to his skills as a pastry-cook, Carême became expert in the other branches of cookery. He was influenced by earlier cooks and food writers, and studied Vincent La Chapelle&#x27;s &quot;Le cuisinier moderne&quot; (1736), Joseph Menon&#x27;s &quot;Soupers de la cour&quot; (1758) and Lémery&#x27;s &quot;Traité des alimens&quot; (1792). He worked for or alongside leading Parisian chefs; he later wrote:

From 1803 to 1814 Carême worked as chef-pâtissier in the kitchens of Talleyrand at the Hôtel de Galliffet, under the head chef, Boucher. He continued to learn about the arts of cookery in general, and was engaged to cater for special events such as the festivities for the marriage of Jérôme Bonaparte to Catharina of Württemberg (1807) and of that of Napoleon to Marie-Louise of Austria (1810). Although of an age liable for conscription into the army, Carême was not called up; Talleyrand may have secured an exemption for him, but that is not certain.

===Professional pinnacle===
After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, the British and Russians occupied Paris. Talleyrand, anxious to be on friendly terms with the allies, invited Tsar Alexander I to stay with him and tasked Carême with delighting his guest with a continual series of fine meals. According to the biographer Marie-Pierre Rey, &quot;Talleyrand&#x27;s generous hospitality undoubtedly had positive effects on the tsar&#x27;s mood and the magnanimity that he showed to the French state&quot;. 

After staying with Talleyrand for some weeks, the tsar took up residence in the Élysée Palace, and requested that Carême should be his head chef there during his stay. The biographer Georges Bernier (fr) writes that this appointment put Carême at the pinnacle of his profession. Already a renowned pastry-cook, he had risen further, to be &quot;chef de cuisine&quot; to the most powerful man in Europe, reflecting his employer&#x27;s status with suitable culinary magnificence. The following year, after Napoleon&#x27;s brief return and final defeat at Waterloo, Alexander returned to Paris, and again secured Carême&#x27;s services. 

When the tsar assembled his troops for a grand review at Châlons-sur-Marne, Carême had to provide three banquets for 300 people each, despite enormous logistical difficulties. There were few supplies available locally and food, wines, linens, glassware and even herds of cattle and flocks of sheep had to be transported from Paris, over away. In addition, Carême had to cope with the tsar&#x27;s preference for Russian servicea succession of individual coursesrather than the traditional French service, in which numerous dishes were set out on the table on hot plates and kept under cloches to keep warm. In Carême&#x27;s view, &quot;This [Russian] manner of service is assuredly favourable to good cheer; but our French service is more elegant and sumptuous. Is there anything more imposing than the sight of a grand table served &quot;à la française&quot;?&quot; Despite Carême&#x27;s opposition, &quot;service à la russe&quot; gradually supplanted the old French service throughout Europe as the 19th century progressed. 

In 1815 Carême published his first books. &quot;Le Pâtissier royal parisien&quot; was an illustrated two-volume compilation of recipes for a skilled pastry-cook. &quot;Le Pâtissier pittoresque&quot; focused on &quot;piéces montées&quot;, with over 100 of Carême&#x27;s drawings of designs, together with what the food writer Barbara Wheaton calls &quot;more or less sketchy instructions&quot; for executing them.

In 1816 Carême accepted the position of chef to the Prince Regent, based at Carlton House in London and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. This was Carême&#x27;s first venture outside France. He was paid an unprecedentedly high salary, and the prince was full of praise for his creations, but Carême was unhappy in his post. He hated the English weather, particularly the fogs, which exacerbated the respiratory problems he had after years of working in smoky kitchens. He found the prince&#x27;s domestic staff unfriendly, even the French footmen, and he later wrote that he endured &quot;l&#x27;ennui extrême&quot; and &quot;mal du pays&quot;he was bored and homesick. He returned to France in late 1817 with no firm plans for his immediate future.

===St Petersburg, Paris and Vienna===
Tsar Alexander returned to Paris in 1818, &quot;en route&quot; to an international congress at Aix-la-Chapelle. Carême&#x27;s friend Muller, comptroller of the tsar&#x27;s household (and dedicatee of &quot;Le Pâtissier pittoresque&quot;), convinced Alexander that having Carême cook for the Russian delegation would enhance its standing, and approached him with the proposal that he should work for the tsar at Aix and then travel with him to Russia. Carême agreed to go to Aix, with a handsome salary and lavish budget, but declined to go on to Russia.

After briefly working in Austria and England for Lord Stewart, the British ambassador to Vienna, Carême decided to take up the tsar&#x27;s offer, and he went by sea to St Petersburg in mid-1819. The timing was unfortunate for him: as he arrived, the tsar was leaving for a forty-day visit to Archangel. In his absence, Carême spent time exploring the architecture of St Petersburg, which he found inspiring&quot;the most beautiful city in the world&quot;. Otherwise, by the time the tsar returned, Carême was disenchanted with Russia, its food and the arrangements at the court. He left at the end of August.

On his return to Paris, Carême became head chef to Princess Catherine Bagration, a distant cousin of the tsar and widow of the celebrated general Pyotr Bagration, killed at the Battle of Borodino in 1812. Carême enjoyed working for the princess, who lived in style and had a discerning appreciation of food, but poor health prevented her from entertaining on the extensive scale that would fully occupy a chef of his standing. Lord Stewart successfully urged Carême to return to work for him.

While working for Stewart, Carême introduced what became the international symbol of the chef: the toque hat. Until then, chefs had generally worn loose berets or cotton caps resembling nightcaps. Carême felt that the latter were reminiscent of the sickroom and &quot;made us look ill&quot; whereas the appearance of a chef should &quot;announce the man in good health&quot;. The toque was quickly taken up by chefs in Vienna, and then in Paris and elsewhere. 

Carême continued to write, and in 1821 he published two volumes of his thoughts on architecture. &quot;Projets d&#x27;architecture dédiés a Alexandre 1&quot; contained drawings of his suggestions for new buildings in St Petersburg, and the second volume, &quot;Projets d&#x27;architecture pour l&#x27;embellisement de Paris&quot;, did the same for his native city. The following year he returned to the subject of catering in his &quot;Le maître d&#x27;hotel français&quot;, comparing old and new cuisine and detailing seasonal menus that he had presented in Paris, St Petersburg, London and Vienna. The title reflected Carême&#x27;s firm conviction that the head chef should control and supervise not only the cooking of the food, but its service as well.

===Last years===
Carême&#x27;s last salaried post came in 1823 as chef to the banker James Rothschild and his wife Betty. Rothschild was by far the richest man in France, and Carême was as happy to work for a &quot;nouveau-riche&quot; employer as for royalty. Rothschild had bought the former house of Napoleon&#x27;s stepdaughter, Hortense de Beauharnais, at 19 rue Lafitte (a few hundred metres from the rue Vivienne, where Carême had been apprenticed). The Rothschilds paid Carême a large salary, and allowed him substantial time off to continue writing his books. He published &quot;Le Cuisinier parisien&quot; in 1828. With him in charge of the catering, the Rothschilds&#x27; house became the focal point of Parisian high society, and Carême&#x27;s name was continually featured in the press.

By the end of the decade it was clear to his employers and to Carême that his health was in decline. The Rothschilds offered him land on which to retire on their country estate, but he preferred to remain in Paris. He declined a final effort by the former Prince Regent, now George IV, to tempt him back to England, and retired to his house in the rue Neuve-Saint-Roch near the Tuileries.

In retirement, Carême worked on his last project, &quot;L&#x27;Art de la cuisine française au XIX siécle&quot;&quot;The Art of French Cookery in the 19th Century&quot;. It was to be a five-volume work, extensively illustrated; he lived to complete the first three volumes. His pupil, Armand Plumerey, added the remaining two volumes that Carême had planned.

Carême died, mentally alert to the end, at his Paris home on 12 January 1833, aged 48 or 49. He was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

==Reputation and legacy==
Carême was known as &quot;the king of chefs and the chef of kings&quot;. Wheaton comments that although he remains the most famous of 19th-century French chefs, there are two differing schools of thought about him. &quot;Gastronomes and food writers have praised him as a great genius of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;&quot;, and have held him up as &quot;an outstanding example of how a lowly apprentice, of a humble background, could rise to the topmost pinnacle of his profession&quot;. An opposing view is that he was conceited, his prose inelegant, his menus &quot;pretentious and heavy&quot; and his &quot;piéces montées&quot; an extravagant waste of ingredients. In Wheaton&#x27;s judgement &quot;the truth lies somewhere in between&quot;.

Carême is credited with codifying the key saucesthe mother sauces, or in his phrase, the &quot;grandes sauces&quot;on which classic French &quot;haute cuisine&quot; is based. His recipes for Velouté, Béchamel, Allemande, and Espagnole became standard for French chefs of his day. His classifications were retained, with modifications, by later chefs including Auguste Escoffier, and the concept of mother sauces continued to be acknowledged by subsequent generations of cooks, including James Beard and Julia Child.

The work of Carême was aimed at the elite of French and other societies. The food writer Stephen Mennell writes that Carême&#x27;s cuisine was not merely &quot;haute&quot; but &quot;grande&quot;, and in one of his books the chef advised people of lesser means not to attempt his elaborate style of cooking: &quot;Better to serve a simple meal, well-prepared, and not try to cover the bourgeois table with an imitation of the rich&quot;. He reacted against some traditional practices, such as garnishing meat with fish and &quot;vice versa&quot;, and he either invented or refined several features of French cookery, including choux pastry, vol-au-vents, profiteroles, and mille-feuilles.

Carême&#x27;s influence continued after his death; his approach was continued by Jules Gouffé, Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard, reinvigorated by Escoffier and continued until &quot;haute cuisine&quot; was supplanted by &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; and simpler styles of cooking in the second half of the 20th century.

<text>The Dallas Texans were an Arena football team based in Dallas, Texas. The Texans were founded in 1990 and were a member of the Arena Football League (AFL). The team played for four seasons, and were relatively successful, making the playoffs three out of four seasons. They played their home games in the Reunion Arena, which they shared with the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association.

==History==
===1990===

In 1990, owner H. Lanier Richey brought the Arena Football League to the state of Texas for the first time. Richey named former Pittsburgh Steeler, Ernie Stautner as the Texans&#x27; first coach in franchise history. The Texans made a noise in May, when they traded 4 players to the Albany Firebirds, for former MVP Ben Bennett and former Ironman of the Year, Carl Aikens, Jr. Stautner lead the Texans to a 6–2 regular season record, and was named the AFL&#x27;s Coach of the Year. The Texans made the ArenaBowl their first season of existence, falling to the Detroit Drive 51–27.

===1991===

In 1991, the Texans had to replace head coach Stautner (who had left for a job with the Denver Broncos), and did so by signing former Cowboys legend, Drew Pearson. Before the season began, the Texans traded Bennett to the Orlando Predators, after Bennett stated his displeasure with the Texans. The team replaced Bennett with former NFL running back, Alfred Jenkins. The Texans started off in the middle of the pack going 3–2 through the first 5 games, before finishing the season 1–4 in the final 5 games. Their 4–6 record was not enough to qualify for the playoffs.

===1992===

On February 21, 1992, Richey sold the franchise to Kent Kramer and Greg Gibson. Kramer replaced Pearson at head coach with Texas Tech assistant coach, John Paul Young. The Texans finished the season 5–5, winning the Western Division, but due to Kramer not anticipating a playoff home game, the Texans did not have the money in their budget to host a game and were forced to travel. The Texans traveled to Albany, New York to play the Firebirds, where they earned a 48–45 victory to advance to the 2nd round of the playoffs. The Texans would lose the following week to the eventual champion, the Detroit Drive.

===1993===

In 1993, Young left the Texans to take a job as the linebackers coach with the Denver Broncos. Kramer hired former Drive and Firebirds assistant, Jerry Trice to be the team&#x27;s new head coach. The Texans finished the season a disappointing 3–9, but still qualified for the playoffs, losing in the first round. In October, the Texans were dropped from the AFL due to being unable to meeting financial requirements.

===Future of AFL in Dallas===
In 2000, Jerry Jones was awarded an expansion franchise in Dallas. Jones was considering using the nickname &quot;Texans&quot; but ultimately choose the Dallas Desperados, playing from 2002 to 2008. The most recent (but now also defunct) Dallas Vigilantes franchise was an expansion team unrelated to either the Texans or Desperados.

<doc id="327986" wikidata="Q5342183" url="?curid=327986" title="Nightcrawler (character)">
<text>Nightcrawler is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, he debuted in the comic book &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). By the time of his creation, there was already another Marvel character with the same name, but with a hyphen (Night-Crawler), which was later changed to Dark-Crawler to avoid confusion.

Nightcrawler, the superhero identity of Kurt Wagner, is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who possess an X-gene that can cause possible physical mutations and in many cases grants some form of superhuman ability. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman agility, the ability to teleport, and adhesive hands and feet. His physical mutations include indigo-colored velvety fur which allows him to become nearly invisible in shadows, two-toed feet and three-fingered hands, yellow eyes, pointed ears, and a prehensile tail. In Nightcrawler&#x27;s earlier comic book appearances, he is depicted as being a happy-go-lucky practical joker and teaser, and a fan of swashbuckling fiction. Nightcrawler is a Catholic, and while this is not emphasized as much in his earlier comic book appearances, in later depictions he is more vocal about his faith. He was originally stated to be from a small village called Witzeldorf in the German state of Bavaria.

In 1994, it was revealed that Nightcrawler was the son of mutant supervillain Mystique / Raven Darkhölme, and for many years after a 2003 storyline, it was believed that he was born out of her short affair with Azazel. However, 2023&#x27;s &quot;X-Men Blue: Origins&quot; revealed that his parents were actually Mystique and her wife Destiny / Irene Adler; Mystique having shapeshifted into her male form to conceive him, with Destiny being the one who experienced the pregnancy and gave birth to him.

Since his inception, Nightcrawler has had a regular presence in Marvel comic books. He has been featured in many video games, and a small number of the 1990s &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series episodes and was a regular on its successors, &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;. He was portrayed by Alan Cumming in the feature film &quot;X2&quot; (2003), while Kodi Smit-McPhee played a younger version of Nightcrawler in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016), &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) and &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019).

==Publication history==
Dave Cockrum originally created Nightcrawler while he was in the United States Navy, stationed at Guam. He recounted: &quot;I sat up one night in the middle of a typhoon because it was too noisy to sleep, so I stayed up and thought up this character. Originally, Nightcrawler was a demon from Hell who had flubbed a mission, and rather than go back and face punishment, he decided to stay up here in the human world. He was supposed to be the sidekick of another superhero character that I had created named The Intruder.&quot; At this point Nightcrawler wore trunks instead of a full costume, but otherwise looked identical to his final version.

Cockrum submitted the character to be part of a group of characters called The Outsiders (not to be confused with the later team The Outsiders), set in the universe of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; series. However, DC rejected the character, resulting in Cockrum importing him to Marvel after he began working on &quot;X-Men&quot; in 1975. Because editor Roy Thomas wanted the new X-Men to be a multinational group, it was decided to make Nightcrawler German.

Although an X-Men character for years, Nightcrawler did not get his own comic book title (written and drawn by Cockrum) until November 1985. In the four-issue limited series &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, along with Lockheed, accidentally travel to several alternate dimensions, meeting strange beings such as the Bamfs. After various adventures, Nightcrawler and Lockheed manage to get home safely.

A second four-issue limited series was published in November 2002. Written by Chris Kipiniak and penciled by Matthew Dow Smith, it focuses upon Nightcrawler&#x27;s decision to become a priest and his attempts to fight a group of slave traders.

In September 2004, the first &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; ongoing title was published by Marvel, written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa with covers and pencils by Darick Robertson. The series was canceled with issue twelve.

In 2014, a new &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; ongoing title commenced, written by Chris Claremont. This was also canceled with issue twelve.

Nightcrawler starred in an ongoing book titled &quot;Way of X&quot;, written by Si Spurrier and illustrated by Bob Quinn. It was announced in January 2021 for an April 2021 debut as part of the X-Men line&#x27;s &quot;Reign of X&quot;, following the conclusion of &quot;X of Swords&quot; crossover. It is billed as a smart, psychedelic tale about faith, science, culture, love and law. The series featured the return of Legion and the threat of Onslaught to the mutant nation.

A one-shot titled &quot;X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation&quot; served as the finale of the first chapter of the series.

In April 2023, it was announced that Wagner would star in a 5-issue miniseries entitled &quot;Uncanny Spider-Man&quot;, written by Spurrier and illustrated by Lee Garbett as a part of the Fall of X, in which he would become the latest Spider-Man (Spinnenmann).

In 2025, Nightcrawler will be getting a solo X-Men project.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Kurt Wagner was born with certain unusual physical characteristics, but his power of self-teleportation did not emerge until puberty. Margali Szardos, a sorceress and a &quot;Manouche Roma&quot; queen, allegedly found Kurt an hour after his birth, in a small roadside shelter in the Black Forest with his father lying dead on the road outside. However, this claim was later called into question, and it was subsequently proven that Kurt was the child of Mystique (also known as Raven Darkholme). In a 2003 story, the mutant Azazel was canonically established as Nightcrawler&#x27;s biological father. However, this was retconned twenty years later. Instead, Mystique impregnated Destiny but changed her body to mimic the pregnancy&#x27;s progression in order to fool the Bavarian nobleman Baron Christian Wagner. Destiny, pretending to be Mystique&#x27;s maid, eventually gave birth to Nightcrawler before Mystique fled with him to the nearby woods to escape attacking villagers. Azazel later found Nightcrawler, believing him to be his from an affair with Mystique, in the woods and gave him to his lover and crony, Margali Szardos, to raise him. This is retconned slightly in 2023&#x27;s &quot;X-Men Blue: Origins&quot;, where Mystique hid Nightcrawler in the woods to go back and rescue Destiny, only to find Destiny gone and Nightcrawler taken upon her return. Destiny likewise implies that she informed Margali of Nightcrawler&#x27;s location. Margali took the newborn Nightcrawler to a small Bavarian circus named Herr Getmann&#x27;s Traveling Menagerie where she worked as a fortune teller as a cover for her activities as a sorceress. Nightcrawler was never legally adopted by anyone, but he was raised by all the members of the circus, who had no prejudices against mutants, except for the ringmaster, Herr Max Getmann. However, Margali took up the role of Nightcrawler&#x27;s unofficial foster mother.

Kurt grew up happily in the circus, and his two closest friends were Margali&#x27;s son Stefan and daughter Jimaine. Long before his teleportation power emerged, Wagner had tremendous natural agility, and by his adolescence, he had become the circus&#x27; star acrobat and aerial artist. Circus audiences assumed that he was a normal-looking human wearing a devil-like costume.

Years later, the Texas millionaire Amos Jardine, who ran a large circus based in Florida, heard of the circus for which Wagner worked and bought it. Jardine intended to move its best acts into his American circus; however, he demanded that Wagner be placed in the circus&#x27; freak show. Jardine drugged him to prevent escape, but a young mutant child with the ability to sense other mutants helped Kurt escape. Appalled, Wagner left and made his way toward Winzeldorf, Germany, where his foster brother Stefan was. He discovered that Stefan had gone mad and brutally slain several children. (It has since been stated that Stefan did not actually go mad, but slew the children because he had recognized them as disguised demons.) When they were younger, Stefan made Kurt promise to kill him if he ever took an innocent life. Two nights after leaving the circus, Wagner found Stefan and fought him, hoping to stop his rampage. In the course of the struggle, Stefan was killed.

===X-Men===

The villagers of Winzeldorf, who assumed from Kurt&#x27;s appearance that he was the one who killed the children, attacked. They were about to kill him when they were all psychically paralyzed by Professor Charles Xavier, who came to recruit Wagner into the X-Men. Before they left for America, he and Xavier went to the Bavarian circus to explain to Margali about Stefan&#x27;s death, but Margali was not there . With the codename Nightcrawler, Wagner becomes a member of the X-Men. Margali held Wagner responsible for murdering Stefan and created a facsimile of the hell from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; in which to punish him years later. Through the use of Doctor Strange&#x27;s all-seeing Eye of Agamotto, she learned the truth, and she and Wagner were reconciled. Wagner was happily reunited with his foster sister Jimaine, who had moved to the United States and changed her name to Amanda Sefton, later becoming Kurt&#x27;s girlfriend.

Sometime later, Nightcrawler fought Shagreen the Sorcerer and became lost in various dimensions, including the manifestation of a fairy tale his teammate Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat) had once told to Illyana Rasputin (Magik). It was there that Nightcrawler first encountered the Bamfs, strange creatures that resembled miniature versions of himself and who would occasionally appear during some of his future adventures.

Shortly after this, and once he had rejoined his teammates, a tactic designed to disable the super-Sentinel Nimrod backfired, and Kurt found himself at the mercies of an angry mob without his teleportation ability. He was rescued by Shadowcat, Colossus, and Magik but feared he had lost his ability for good. His power returned but left him drained and vulnerable when he used it, again leading to self-doubt about his value to the team. During the Mutant Massacre (the Marauders&#x27; assault on the Morlock tunnels), this exhaustion left him vulnerable to an attack from Riptide, which injured him into a coma.

===Excalibur===
While he recovers from these injuries, his fellow X-Men were apparently killed on a mission in Dallas. Not long after, Nightcrawler and teammates Shadowcat and Rachel Summers left to join Captain Britain in an adventure in the UK. They fought Gatecrasher&#x27;s group of inter-dimensional mercenaries known as the Technet. The heroes worked together so well, they decided to form a group they named Excalibur. Captain Britain originally assumed leadership of the group, but Nightcrawler gradually took over the responsibility. When Captain Britain&#x27;s and Meggan&#x27;s relationship went through a rocky time, Nightcrawler became interested in Meggan, a feeling that was reciprocated but never consummated. During his time with Excalibur, he took charge of the Technet, renaming them his &#x27;N-Men&#x27;, and he became romantically involved with his teammate Cerise before she left to stand trial before the Shi&#x27;ar. Later, his former girlfriend, Amanda Sefton, joined the team and the two continued their previous relationship. She left the team to take control of Limbo, a task that kept her away from Earth, but the two remained close friends. Fearing it would be stolen from her, Amanda magically hid the Soulsword inside Nightcrawler&#x27;s body.

===Returning to the X-Men===

For a time, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler express some resentment over the X-Men&#x27;s failing to contact them after their supposed deaths. Following the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan, Excalibur disbands and Nightcrawler returns to the X-Men with Shadowcat and Colossus. Yet, as soon as they return, they face a group of impostors following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X.

Wanting to devote more time to the priesthood, Nightcrawler shares team leadership with Archangel. However, his work as a priest is retconned to be an illusion; he had, in fact, never attained priesthood. He has also met his half-brothers Nils Styger, alias Abyss, and Kiwi Black. With them, Nightcrawler defeated his father Azazel, who had tried to use him as a pawn in escaping his prison.

Later, Nightcrawler served as the new leader of the Uncanny X-Men team alongside Wolverine, Bishop, Psylocke, Cannonball, and Marvel Girl. In the last mission against the Foursaken, Nightcrawler took his team (except for Wolverine) to Central Park. He later helped Storm liberate Africa from her uncle&#x27;s control.

Afterwards, Professor X recruited him, along with Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Warpath, and Polaris, to participate in a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the Shi&#x27;ar empire. During the battle with Vulcan, Nightcrawler helped get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to their spaceship. While there, trying to save Professor X, Lilandra sent the ship on its way back to Earth, leaving half the team behind.

Kurt was still part of Professor X&#x27;s team, helping Charles find Magneto before the government did, while the rest of the team searched for the Morlocks.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Nightcrawler was part of Wolverine&#x27;s S.H.I.E.L.D. team and helped Mystique track him down. After his memory returned, he assisted in the final confrontation against Magneto. Upon their return to the true reality, he rapidly teleported around the mansion to find Wolverine on Cyclops&#x27; orders, as both men worried that Wolverine would have lost his powers and therefore be vulnerable to metal poisoning caused by his adamantium skeleton.

===&quot;Messiah Complex&quot;===
When the first mutant since M-Day appeared, Cyclops sent Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Angel, Storm, and Colossus to find former Acolytes for information on the Marauders. It was predicted by Blindfold that Kurt would be seriously injured in the upcoming events, and indeed this came true when he was shot by the Marauder, Scalphunter. Kurt seemed to have nearly fully recovered from his injuries since he, along with Beast and the entire New X-Men team, is teleported to Muir Island by Pixie. He took part in the final battle.

===Divided We Stand===
Still recovering from his injuries, Kurt traveled through Europe along with Wolverine and Colossus. Kurt and Wolverine were currently involved in a &quot;war of pranks,&quot; as Peter called it. One of the many pranks involved Logan hacking into Kurt&#x27;s image inducer to make him look like Angelina Jolie, which resulted in a picture of Angelina and Peter appearing in assorted tabloid newspapers. The three of them traveled to Russia, where they visited the cemetery where Peter&#x27;s family is buried. Afterward, they went to a local bar, where they discussed the recent loss of Kitty Pryde and the destruction of the X-Men. A fight occurred in the bar, during which their cover was blown. Soon after, the three of them were captured by the Russian government, which demanded to know why all their mutants were depowered and why Colossus, Wolverine, and Nightcrawler retained their abilities. After a battle with Omega Red, the three heroes returned to the US and rejoined the team, now living in San Francisco.

===Manifest Destiny===
Kurt, along with Wolverine and Karma ambushed the Hellfire Cult after a series of mutant related hate-crimes happened around San Francisco. He also took it upon himself to build a new chapel at Graymalkin Industries, the X-Men&#x27;s new home and base of operations.

During a training session in the Danger Room, he revealed he was trying to keep himself distracted because whenever he had time to think, he couldn&#x27;t help but think of Kitty, how the X-Men didn&#x27;t need him, and how Pixie was a better teleporter than he was. After battling (unsuccessfully) several simulated villains, he reprogrammed the Danger Room to show Kitty. He confessed he was sorry he wasn&#x27;t there for her and hugged the simulation and cried. The simulation of Kitty replied that she missed Kurt, too.

Nightcrawler briefly believed that he no longer had a role with the X-Men, especially due to Pixie&#x27;s abilities in teleporting. A trip back to Germany renewed his conviction through an encounter with a boy cursed by gypsies into demonic form, a brush with Mephisto, and a romantic fling, before he returned to San Francisco to aid the X-Men against a foe they struggled with, lacking his help.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
In the 2008 storyline &quot;Secret Invasion,&quot; Nightcrawler fought alongside the X-Men when the Skrulls invaded San Francisco. He came across a Skrull bible and, after studying it, gave it to Beast, who figured out how to deal with the Skrulls.

===&quot;X-Infernus&quot;===
In the 2008 miniseries &quot;X-Infernus&quot;, Pixie summoned her Souldagger and stabbed Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removed her Souldagger, Magik&#x27;s Soulsword emerged from his chest.

Magik teleported away after taking out Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide, and Beast. Kurt woke up and stopped Pixie from going after her, and Pixie broke down and apologized for stabbing him. Later, the X-Men gathered and Kurt was put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik.

Upon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fought their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide were horrified at how brutal the older X-Men were towards the demons. An octopus-type creature attacked Kurt until Pixie jumped in and killed it with her Souldagger.

Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleported the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turned Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt noticed Illyana chained to a pillar, and she asked him to stab her with Pixie&#x27;s Souldagger, as it was the only way and he was the only one to do it because he was attuned to magic. He apologized and stabbed her; at that moment Colossus punched Kurt, and Witchfire finished making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie.

The fact, however, that Colossus and Wolverine hadn&#x27;t killed him made Kurt realize they were not fully under her control. Using Pixie&#x27;s Dagger, Kurt then pulled Illyana&#x27;s Soulsword from her and used it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire&#x27;s control. However, the demon managed to use the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie fled. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoled Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleported them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinced her to stay with them and join the X-Men.

===Necrosha===
After mutants rose from the dead and attacked the island Utopia as part of the Necrosha storyline, Cyclops sent Nightcrawler to lead a team of X-Men consisting of Rogue, Trance, Magneto, Husk, Psylocke, Colossus, and Blindfold to investigate Muir Island. It was revealed that Proteus had been resurrected and had taken possession of Blindfold (who had the vision of going to Muir Island in the first place).

===&quot;Second Coming&quot; and death ===
In the 2010 &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot; storyline, the X-Men traveled to Westchester when Cable and Hope were detected there. Nightcrawler&#x27;s discovery of the lethal methods used by X-Force led to an argument between him and Cyclops. While teleporting during a battle with Bastion, Bastion extended his arm into the space in which Nightcrawler would materialize. Nightcrawler rematerialized around Bastion&#x27;s arm, fusing with it. Though mortally wounded, he managed to teleport Hope to Utopia, telling her before expiring that he believed in her.

===Afterlife===
Despite his death, Nightcrawler continued to aid his friends. When Wolverine was possessed by Hellverine, Nightcrawler entered his friend&#x27;s mind to help him drive out the invader. The other X-Men who entered Logan&#x27;s mind to help him assumed that Nightcrawler was just a manifestation of Wolverine&#x27;s mind, rather than the real one.

===Resurrection===
Nightcrawler spent his sojourn in Heaven alongside Professor X, but despite enjoying paradise, Nightcrawler continued to feel as though he had unfinished business, remaining on the periphery rather than actually joining the heavenly choir. When Azazel mounted an attack on Heaven using his connection to Kurt as a door, Nightcrawler instructed a few Bamfs to create a portal to Heaven inside the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, allowing him to summon the X-Men to aid him in his fight. Having gathered his friends, Kurt used the Bamfs and his connection to Azazel to restore himself to life back on Earth, thus preventing Azazel from attacking Heaven again by tying them both together, although this resulted in Kurt sacrificing his own soul to ensure that Azazel would not be able to return to Heaven. His &#x27;Welcome Back&#x27; party is subsequently attended by all the X-Men, including Cyclops&#x27; branch of the team. Despite the tensions between them, Nightcrawler stated that he wanted all of his family to be present. Nightcrawler later left the party to confront Mystique when she was successfully freeing Azazel.

With Storm&#x27;s and Rachel&#x27;s encouragement, Nightcrawler accepted a teaching position at the Jean Grey School, where he formed a bond with the pupil Scorpion Boy. While attempting to reunite with Amanda Sefton, he was duped by her mother Margali Szardos to grant her sanctuary at the school, where she forcefully extracted the knowledge about the Beyond from Beast and Storm to open a portal to the Afterlife. Nightcrawler and Amanda managed to foil Margali but at the cost of Amanda getting stranded in the Void. Afterward, Nightcrawler and Scorpion Boy engaged the Crimson Pirates, who acted on behalf of Tullamore Voge, over the custody of a young mutant named Ziggy Karst, who subsequently joined the Jean Grey School. Soon afterward, Nightcrawler and Bloody Bess were forced to fight against their fellow Crimson Pirates and X-Men, all mind-controlled by the resurrected Shadow King. The fight ended with the Pirates kidnapping Ziggy and Scorpion Boy and fatally stabbing Nightcrawler; but on his way to the afterlife he was intercepted by Amanda, Wolverine and the Phoenix, who encouraged him to return. Together with Bess and the Bamfs, he traveled to Voge&#x27;s interdimensional child slave market and rescued Ziggy and Scorpion Boy, battling Voge&#x27;s henchmen and the Warwolves. In the end, they defeated Voge, breaking up his slavery racket, and returned the enslaved children, taking those orphaned by the slavers into the school.

During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, both Storm and Magneto were having a conflict on their own to save mutantkind from the Terrigen Mist. Storm and the other X-Men who followed her decision to support Captain Marvel&#x27;s side, to require the Inhumans&#x27; help to solve their kinds&#x27; extinction from breathing that mist. Nightcrawler decided to join Magneto and Iron Man&#x27;s side. He later joined Kitty Pryde&#x27;s mutant school. He eventually developed romantic feelings for his longtime friend and teammate Rachel.

===Residing on Krakoa===
When the mutant colony of Krakoa was established, Kurt was given a position on the council, helping to shape the laws of this new mutant society. However, Kurt&#x27;s religious concerns led him to decide to form a mutant religion.

===Operating as Spider-Man===
During the &quot;Fall of X&quot; in light of Orchis&#x27; attack on Krakoa, Nightcrawler assumed the identity of the Uncanny Spider-Man (Spinnenmann) after he gained a spare suit from Spider-Man following Orchis&#x27; previous brainwashing on him to assassinate some heads of state and Orchis&#x27; attack on the Hellfire Gala. His activities as Spinnenmann are tracked by an Orchis facility run by Vulture, now calling himself Director Vulture after he upgraded his suit with a sample of the Technarchy. In addition, Kurt also became a target for Silver Sable and the Wild Pack. Kurt later battled Rhino, who was under the same mind-control technology that was used on him. Despite Silver Sable&#x27;s interference, Kurt was able to defeat Rhino. Nightcrawler then took up the name of Creepy Crawler when he was targeted by Orchis Hounds who consist of the Technarchy-possessed Animax, Cloak and Dagger, Fatale, Feral, and Reaper. It was also during this time that he started an affair with Silver Sable, and he also encountered Mystique, whose memory had been warped by Professor X, tormenting her with guilt over her loss of Kurt right after his birth.

Nightcrawler managed to restore Mystique&#x27;s full memory, learning in the process that not Azazel, but Mystique herself was his father and Destiny his actual mother; his likeness to Azazel came about due to Raven&#x27;s assimilation of Azazel&#x27;s genes. When her mutant identity was revealed right after Kurt&#x27;s birth, she fled with Kurt on Irene&#x27;s urging, only to find the mob chasing her going back for Irene. Leaving Kurt at the base of a tree, she rushed back to save her love, but in the end found both Irene and Kurt gone. Years later, after Mystique found her in custody of Anna Marie, Irene revealed that her precognition had made her see Azazel conquering the world and killing all mutantkind, and that he would only be thwarted by a child he would presume to be his blood heir. Thus she told Margali where to find Kurt, to have him raised into the role as a hero. To resume their relationship for Anna Marie&#x27;s sake, they asked Professor X to erase their memories of Bavaria, though Raven insisted on still being able to remember Kurt as her son. Upon this revelation, Kurt and Raven reconciled.

Aware of Kurt and Sable&#x27;s relationship, Vulture hired Wild Pack&#x27;s second-in-command Kremer to capture Nightcrawler for Orchis. However, Nightcrawler, Sable and Mystique worked out a ruse to infiltrate the Orchis base, and they freed Warlock, who had earlier been captured by Nimrod, and whose Technarchy virus had been used by Vulture to create the Hounds. Nightcrawler defeated Vulture and had Warlock purge him and the captive mutants of the Technarchy before they escaped, and Mystique parted ways with him once more to find Destiny.

==Powers and abilities==
Kurt Wagner is a mutant whose primary mutant power is the ability to teleport himself, his clothing, and a certain amount of additional mass from one point to another virtually instantaneously. He does this by displacing himself through an alternate dimension briefly and reappearing in a desired, pre-selected location. He has been shown to be able to teleport distances of up to under optimal conditions, although this is usually his outer limit, and he can become severely fatigued if he tries to teleport that distance; he has exceeded this limit on multiple occasions. In one case, he teleported somewhere over . Via coordinates received telepathically from Professor Xavier, Nightcrawler has teleported an unknown (but presumably large) distance. In a final, dying effort to rescue the mutant-messiah Hope, he teleported them both from Las Vegas, Nevada to the mutant safehold Utopia, just off the coast of San Francisco, California, a distance of more than . Nightcrawler&#x27;s teleportation ability is also affected by direction—north-south along Earth&#x27;s &quot;magnetic lines of force&quot; is easier than east–west against them.

His effective teleport range was extended after his revival both due to outside assistance and a later enhancement to his powers, thanks to a deal he made with a demonic race of Bamfs loaned to him by Azazel. Nightcrawler can warp greater distances by locking onto them as a form of waypoint marker to teleport longer distances, even trans-dimensional ones. Beyond the use of his own demonic companions Kurt can now seemingly transport himself longer distances without tiring, be they local or continental in range, having teleported over from the UAE (United Arab Emirates) to Antarctica, and again traveling over from the Czech Republic to Egypt. He possesses a limited unconscious extrasensory &quot;spatial awareness&quot; ability which prevents him from teleporting into solid objects within his immediate vicinity, but this ability diminishes the greater the distance he teleports. Because teleporting into other solid matter would cause severe injury or death, he will only teleport to an area he is familiar with or that he can clearly see at the time or has seen in the past. His power automatically displaces liquids and gases when he arrives.

The process of teleportation places a strain on his endurance and that of any passengers; carrying mass other than his body and clothing when teleporting adds additional strain to his body. Through practice, he has been able to teleport with a passenger over a long distance without exhausting himself. Extensive training has raised his tolerance for teleportation, but most of his passengers lack this tolerance. Therefore, one of his tactics is to grab opponents and make several quick teleportations with them. They usually become weakened or even pass out from the strain.

After Nightcrawler teleports, he leaves behind the smoke and a faint scent of burning brimstone; this is a small portion of the atmosphere of the dimension through which he travels when he teleports. His teleportation power is due to a biophysical/biochemical reaction he consciously triggers within himself. A loud &quot;bamf&quot; noise is always present whenever he teleports (being the sound of air rushing to fill the space he was just occupying). His teleporting also causes a slight change in the atmosphere before he arrives, although only superhumans with heightened senses such as Daredevil can detect it.

In addition to his primary power of teleportation, Nightcrawler&#x27;s physiology is unique in several different ways. His agility far surpasses that of an Olympic-level gymnast, and his bone structure allows him great flexibility. His spine is more flexible than an ordinary human, enabling him to remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to his spine. Nightcrawler&#x27;s balance and bodily coordination are all enhanced to superhuman levels. He has the ability to cling to surfaces through microscopic suction cups located on the pads of his hands and feet. However, some surfaces are so frictionless that he cannot cling to them. He also possesses superhuman dexterity, being able to manipulate items and fence with either hand as well as his tail.

He has the ability to blend into shadows, both as a result of his indigo fur, and the dimensional portal which always surrounds his body and absorbs photons. At one point shortly after his initial introduction, it was suggested that he could actually travel through shadows (in much the same way Psylocke did after exposure to the Crimson Dawn) and this was shown in &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot;, but never really touched upon after that. In the story, Vanisher removes some of the Darkforce that formed his costume and threw it at Kurt, who disappeared. He then reappeared from within the Darkforce on the ground, saying that it was like &quot;a pool of shadow&quot; and that he &quot;fell right through it&quot;.

Nightcrawler has a prehensile tail, allowing him to grab onto objects with relative ease. His tail is strong enough to not only support his body weight, but also lift an adult man completely off the ground at the same time, and is deft enough to fight with while wielding a sword or blunt object. He also possesses a degree of heightened night vision.

Aside from the abilities granted by his mutation, Nightcrawler is a superb fencer and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, to the point of being able to stalemate super-beings as powerful as Captain Britain. He has also served as the team&#x27;s pilot and medic when more qualified X-Men were not around to do so. He and Wolverine were also the mechanics of the X-Men&#x27;s Blackbird jet for a long time. He is also recognized by other Marvel characters as the leading authority on teleportation, with Spider-Man and Daredevil contacting him for information and advice following their first encounter with Francis Klum. Nightcrawler deduced from analysis of photographs of a crime scene that a man had been killed by someone else teleporting inside the victim, despite having never witnessed such a thing before.

For a long period, Kurt&#x27;s body housed the Soulsword. Magik states that Kurt is attuned to magic and thus able to wield her Soulsword and Pixie&#x27;s Souldagger. After Margali Szardos had brainwashed him under Orchis&#x27; command, she manifested a part of Kurt&#x27;s soul essence which represented his innate hope into a Hopesword. The exact capabilities of the Hopesword are not known yet, but so far it has been able to stun an opponent impaled by it and restore sanity to Mystique&#x27;s shattered mind.

As an after-effect of his death and resurrection, Nightcrawler has developed a heightened resistance against psychic domination which helped him resist the Shadow King&#x27;s telepathic powers, even after the latter had possessed such strong minds as Rachel Grey and Psylocke moments before. With the loss of his soul, he has also been rendered quasi-immortal, although he still feels the pain of any injuries inflicted upon him.

==Family relations==
&quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont had intended to reveal that Nightcrawler was the son of Nightmare early in his run. Roger Stern recounted, &quot;It happened when I was the writer of &quot;Dr. Strange&quot;, back when writers were still occasionally listened to. Chris had come up with the latest of several crazy ideas and declared that Nightcrawler&#x27;s father was Nightmare. And I replied with something like, &#x27;No, he&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m not going to let you appropriate one of my character&#x27;s major villains.&#x27; As I recall, Len Wein crossed the room and shook my hand. And not too long after, I [became] the &quot;X-Men&quot; editor and was able to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen for long enough that Chris eventually changed his mind.&quot; Claremont&#x27;s new plan was for the mutant terrorist Mystique and her lover Destiny to have been Nightcrawler&#x27;s biological parents. Mystique, being a shapeshifter, would have taken the form of a man and impregnated Destiny. However, Marvel felt the idea to be too controversial and an alternative origin was developed.

After hinting for many years that Mystique was indeed Nightcrawler&#x27;s biological mother, it was confirmed by writer Scott Lobdell in &quot;X-Men Unlimited&quot; #4. In 2003, it was revealed that although Mystique was married to a wealthy German, Herr Wagner, Nightcrawler&#x27;s father was Azazel, a member of a race of demonic-looking mutants known as the Neyaphem which date back to Biblical times that were banished to another dimension by a race of angelic mutants. The storyline was furthered by the revelation that fellow X-Man Archangel&#x27;s healing blood did not heal Nightcrawler, and in fact caused him great pain.

However this was actually a ruse perpetuated by Destiny to deceive Azazel&#x27;s plans and he was never actually Nightcrawler&#x27;s father. Instead, Mystique impregnated Destiny but changed her body to mimic the pregnancy&#x27;s progression to fool the Bavarian nobleman, Baron Christian Wagner. Destiny, pretending to be Mystique&#x27;s maid, eventually gave birth to Nightcrawler before Mystique fled with him to the nearby woods to escape attacking villagers. Charles Xavier later erased the details of Nightcrawler&#x27;s birth from both Destiny and Mystique&#x27;s minds at Destiny&#x27;s request.

Nightcrawler&#x27;s siblings include his adoptive sister Rogue and half-brother Graydon Creed by Mystique. They previously included Abyss and Kiwi Black from Azazel; however, it was revealed that Azazel never actually fathered a child with Mystique. He is also a distant cousin to Blindfold and Trevor Chase, grandsons of Destiny.

It is also revealed that in a parallel universe, an alternate Nightcrawler fathered a daughter with an alternate Scarlet Witch; this girl, named Nocturne, is a dimensionally-stranded mutant bearing traits similar to Nightcrawler himself. Nocturne has since referred to Nightcrawler as her father. The demeanor of Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturne&#x27;s reality, so the two developed a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.

==Characteristics==
Nightcrawler is a mutant born with fine blue-black fur covering his body, two fingers with an opposable thumb on each hand and only two toes, each longer than a normal human being&#x27;s, on each foot and a third toe-like projection on his heel, as well as pronounced, fang-like canine teeth on both upper and lower sets, yellow eyes, pointed ears, and a prehensile pointed tail which can support his weight.

Among his more ironic character traits, Wagner is an extremely religious man. A devout Catholic, his demonic appearance obviously makes it very difficult to attend Mass. Despite this, as mutants in the Marvel Universe become more accepted, he even managed to almost become a Catholic priest, but his studies were interrupted by a villainous group known as &quot;The Neo&quot;.

In contrast, Nightcrawler also has a knack for the spontaneous and exciting. He sees himself as a swashbuckler, usually comparing himself to Errol Flynn. He is, despite his looks, always charming and gallant, and several storylines contain Kurt&#x27;s love life as a conflict to his religious nature. His days in the circus make him a gifted performer and showman. Kurt is also a jokester. He has a great sense of humor for someone in his situation. He always plays pranks on people; some even call him &quot;Trickster&quot; because his combined teleporting abilities and playful disposition enable him to play quite the joke.

Wagner has used a personal holographic device called an image-inducer on several occasions to pose as a human. However, after an incident where he lost a bet with Wolverine and was forced to walk through town without it, he was emboldened and has since largely forsaken the use of the device, using it only when necessary.

==Reception==
Nightcrawler has received positive reception as a comic book character and as a member of the X-Men. Nightcrawler was ranked as the 133rd-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also ranked Nightcrawler as the 80th-greatest comic book hero of all time describing Nightcrawler as a mutant with the appearance of a demon and the heart of a preacher; IGN also states that as the X-Men enter one of their most uncertain periods, his legacy still looms large. In 2006, IGN has also rated Nightcrawler at #7 on their list of top 25 X-Men from the past 40 years, stating that religion is one of the few commonalities that could bring mutants and humans together, and it is through his faith that Nightcrawler has stayed true to the X-Men for so long. In 2008, Marvel rated their top ten X-Men of all time. Nightcrawler ranked #4 on their list stating that far from a character consumed by doom and gloom, Nightcrawler&#x27;s chivalry, a flair for the dramatic and sense of humor have made him one of the most likable X-Men ever, a character you genuinely look forward to seeing leap into action. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Nightcrawler as #19 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Nightcrawler 5th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

In 2018, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Nightcrawler 28th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; miniseries, Nightcrawler is similar to his Earth-616 counterpart, but much darker and more violent, and he carries two sabers at all times, denoting his skills as a swordsman. Another important difference is that this Nightcrawler hates churches, having had a traumatic experience when he was younger. Nightcrawler is close to his mother, Mystique, and he even calls her &quot;Mom.&quot; Nightcrawler is sent by Magneto to Avalon, an Antarctic utopia where humans and mutants peacefully coexist, to bring Destiny back to the United States to confirm Bishop&#x27;s claims. While there, Avalon is attacked by Apocalypse&#x27;s Pale Riders. Nightcrawler and Mystique vow to protect Avalon from the Pale Riders and are joined by fellow mutants Switchback and former Pale Rider Damask to face the Shadow King. Nightcrawler also goes by Kurt Darkholme instead of Kurt Wagner in this reality.

The AOA Nightcrawler appears to always be &quot;breathing fire&quot; when teleporting. Presumably this is simply an optical illusion of his teleportation powers, as it does not appear to have any adverse effects on anything Kurt comes in contact with as he does so. Also, this version seemingly believes his biological father is Sabretooth as is evidenced by Mystique stating that she had gone to the trouble of &quot;finding a father with fur&quot; when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and, when the Shadow King possesses Mystique, the captions reveal &quot;one memory is more interesting than the others&quot; and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler.

After the events of the Dark Angel Saga, AoA Nightcrawler chooses to remain in the 616 reality and join X-Force. Searching for the Sugar Man, Dark Beast, Iceman and Blob, Kurt promises to &quot;kill the bastards who ruined our lives&quot;. He is openly hostile concerning being mistaken with his alternative self; at one point he roughly shoves Kitty aside when she mistakes him for a returned-from-the-dead main universe Nightcrawler, declaring that he is not back and does not know her.

He has successfully killed Blob by teleporting a shark into his stomach which devoured Blob from the inside and he has executed Iceman by leading him into a factory boiler room where the weakened Iceman begged for forgiveness. Nightcrawler proceeded to throw his former friend into the factory fire to his death. He has also made several unsuccessful attempts on Dark Beast&#x27;s life.

This version of Nightcrawler demonstrated the ability to control how much of another person traveled with him when teleporting, allowing him to kill a man by teleporting only his head.

In March 2013, &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; participated in the &quot;X-Termination&quot; crossover, which focuses on the AoA Nightcrawler&#x27;s attempt to get to his home universe. During the event, the AoA reality seemingly is destroyed with Nightcrawler in it.

===Bamf===
In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #153 Kitty Pryde tells Illyana a bedtime story. In it she casts him as a cute creature called &quot;Bamf&quot;. He is only two feet tall and looks like a super deformed version of Kurt, even right down to his costume. He is fun-loving and somewhat lecherous. At first he only existed in a Fairy Tale, but Kurt himself met Bamf and the other characters from pale Kitty&#x27;s story during an accidental interdimensional trip. It soon turns out there are multiple Bamfs, including female versions; the Bamfs even declared him their &quot;Daddy&quot;. The Bamfs later let their affection for Kitty Pryde get the best of them and even resorted to endangering Kitty&#x27;s pet dragon Lockheed.

===Days of Future Past===
Nightcrawler is dead in the alternative timeline Earth-811, but he had a daughter known as Blue. She inherited the power to teleport herself and others, and a similar appearance.

===Exiles===
Nocturne is a member of the alternative-reality traveling Exiles, and a former member of New Excalibur. Like all members of the Exiles she is from an alternative dimension. In her dimension the Scarlet Witch married Nightcrawler, and Nocturne is their daughter.

In her reality, Charles Xavier was attacked by a Shadow King-controlled Wolverine. Although the Shadow King was expelled from Wolverine&#x27;s mind, Xavier was fatally wounded in the attack and Logan was left crippled. Shortly after, Jean Grey died and Cyclops, blaming Wolverine for both deaths, abandoned the team, leaving Wolverine and Nightcrawler as the leaders of the X-Men and the Xavier Institute.

The demeanor of this Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Earth-616 Nightcrawler, so the first time that Nocturne met 616-Nightcrawler she accidentally calls him &quot;Dad.&quot; In subsequent meetings Nocturne and 616-Nightcrawler have developed a bond similar to a father-daughter relationship.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Nightcrawler appears as a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Red Guard, a task force of elite mutants designed to quell insurrections; Nightcrawler has a small role when the Red Guard attempts to track down their leader, Wolverine, who remembers the world before the Scarlet Witch changed reality. Nightcrawler also appears in &quot;World of M&quot;, where he attempts to aid Apocalypse when the latter is under attack by Namor, Storm, and Sunfire.

===Kurt Waggoner===
A Brooklyn boy on his world, Kurt is a fan of Spider-Man. He was taken from his world by force, an event he will not talk about as it resulted in the death of someone close to him. He was held by the forces of the Saviour until rescued through the efforts of Scott Summers. Kurt fought to save the multiverse as part of a cross-dimension X-Men team in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; but was killed trying to save the team in the &quot;X-Termination&quot; event.

===Marvel Zombies: Dead Days===
In the Marvel Zombies universe at Earth 2149, where the superhero population gradually becomes infected by a zombie virus, Nightcrawler is among the remaining uninfected superheroes attempting to save what remains of the Earth population. He is bitten by the zombie Fantastic Four in the one-shot &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;, and is one of the last superheroes to be infected. When the Ultimate version of Reed Richards travels to the Marvel Zombies Universe, Nightcrawler is among the zombified superheroes who attack him in the ruins of New York, but the attempt failed. Zombie Nightcrawler also appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness&quot;, whereas he is seen as a zombie also, attempting to attack the fortress of the villain known as Dr. Doom.

===Misfits===
In the Amerimanga series &quot;X-Men Misfits&quot;, Kurt&#x27;s design is radically different with talon-like claws instead of toes and a metal tail.

===Old Man Logan===
In the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline, Nightcrawler is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super-villains attacking the mansion.

===Predator vs. Wolverine===
In the &quot;Predator vs. Wolverine&quot; miniseries, with takes place in an alternate reality, Nightcrawler helps Wolverine fight a Predator by teleporting himself behind it and disconnecting the tubes which connecting its breathing apparatus to its mask, causing it to temporarily lose its balance.

===Ruins===
In Warren Ellis&#x27; &quot;Ruins&quot;, Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler is seen of the deformed mutants jailed at a prison in Texas where he is seen gnawing on his own tail.

===Secret Wars===
====Limbo Domain====
A member of the X-Men, Nightcrawler battled the Limbo&#x27;s Demon Horde when it assaulted Manhattan. The X-Men failed both to repel them and to save Illyana Rasputin from N&#x27;Astirh. The invasion was then contained behind a wall which split the domain in two. As part of a deal with Scott Summers, Illyana&#x27;s brother Colossus would assemble a team once a year, on the invasion&#x27;s anniversary, to try to retrieve Illyana. Nightcrawler&#x27;s part of the mission was to pick a drop zone and teleport them in. When Scott informed Colossus that he refused to send a team to the demon domain, since the last time, both Scott and Colossus were crippled in the fight, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde refused to let Colossus down and offered him a last chance. Kurt, along with Boomer and Colossus&#x27; girlfriend Domino, formed the team. Teleporting in the demon domain, the team was soon attacked, and separated, with Kurt rescuing Boomer from winged demons. Back on the ground, Darkchild and N&#x27;Astirh appeared, capturing Nightcrawler and leaving Boomer mortally wounded.

Imprisoned, he was tortured and his soul was corrupted by Darkchild, turning him into a massive demon under her control. Darkchild used Nightcrawler to pass the force field and assaulted the X-Men controlled area of Inferno.

The &quot;Bamf Dragon&quot; (as called by Scott, unaware it was actually Nightcrawler) caused great damages while battling the X-Men. As the science and magic teams quitted their post to assist the X-Men, Illyana and Kurt teleported inside the building to target the force field, maintained only by Hank McCoy and Strange. They were both killed and the field dropped out, letting all of Inferno&#x27;s demons enter Manhattan. &quot;Bamfy&quot; later wandered through the streets with Darkchild, as the Demon Horde rampaged the city. &quot;Bamfy&quot; found the last X-Men survivors in a subway tunnel, and teleported N&#x27;Astirh and many demons. The team sent in Inferno returned along the Goblin Queen and her subjects, and rescued the X-Men. As Jean Grey had Bamfy immobilized and tried to connect with him, Madelyne stepped in and put him under her own control claiming that Kurt&#x27;s mind had been destroyed when Darkchild turned him into a massive dragon.

After Sinister proposed an alliance to the X-Men and the Goblin Queen, providing himself an army of demon/mutant hybrid clones made from Boomer&#x27;s DNA, Madelyne avenged herself by controlling Boomer to kill him. The clones consequently turned against the Goblin Queen, who was then protected by Bamfy. With all the X-Men either dead or on the run, Madelyne, still accompanied by Bamfy, usurped the Hellfire energies from Darkchild&#x27;s corpse, and became the new Baron of the domain.

====All-New, All-Different Marvel====
After the end of the Battleworld, Bamfy along with the Goblin Queen and her Goblin Horde, managed to access Prime Earth.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate version of Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) is a much more militant young mutant, only fourteen years old when first introduced. His first appearances have him forced to battle the X-Men alongside a team of Weapon X agents.

He had been captured by Weapon X and forced to act as an assassin and black ops agent. His Weapon X origins link him more closely with Wolverine and Rogue than other teammates. Originally speaking only German, he learned to speak English with the help of Jean Grey&#x27;s mental powers. Though Nightcrawler returns home after he escapes from Weapon X, he soon joined the X-Men to fight Magneto.

Nightcrawler is originally portrayed as a friendly, humorous man with a zest for high adventure that has gained him the friendship of many fellow X-Men. One of Kurt&#x27;s closest friends was Angel, with whom he &quot;misused&quot; the Danger Room for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;-like &quot;role-playing&quot; sessions under the name of &quot;the dread Captain Blue Tail,&quot; as it is shown that he is a fan of the movie. He has a fan-crush on Keira Knightley.

When Dazzler, Kurt&#x27;s unrequited love, slips into a coma due to injuries inflicted by Deathstrike, Kurt begins to lose control of his delicate psyche, regressing to his Weapon X days. His loneliness is exacerbated by Angel&#x27;s departure from the X-Men, and by the breakdown in his relationship with Colossus after Colossus reveals his sexual orientation.

Shortly following Dazzler&#x27;s awakening, Kurt&#x27;s irrational, increasing obsession with Dazzler prompted him to teleport her to a secluded cave, telling her that the X-Men had been attacked and that he was protecting her. The X-Men rescued Dazzler and, learning what he had done, confronted Kurt, resulting in a battle. Kurt was defeated and placed in a vegetative state by Charles Xavier in the hopes that Xavier could treat Kurt&#x27;s damaged psyche. At his bedside, Rogue, who had absorbed his memories during the battle, told him she now considered him as much a monster on the inside as he appeared on the outside. Whether this was in regard to his Weapon X assassin activities or something else remains to be seen.

After Xavier was kidnapped by the time-traveling Cable, his hold on Kurt was broken, and Kurt vanished from the Xavier Institute. In issue #80 he saves Pyro from the Friends of Humanity. Pyro reveals the existence of the Morlocks. Nightcrawler is captured by the Morlocks, who believe he is a spy for Xavier. Shortly, the X-Men arrive to search for Toad, who was sent as an emissary. A fight ensues. During the battle, Nightcrawler helps his former teammates and subdues Sunder, the leader of the Morlocks. He decides to stay with the Morlocks since they were physically mutated like him. They elect him their new leader. When Sinister targets the Morlocks for sacrifices in his attempts to summon Apocalypse, Nightcrawler joins in the fight.

Kurt returns to Xavier&#x27;s on occasion to hang out with his former teammates and slowly starts to accept Colossus&#x27; homosexuality, even standing up for him when the X-Men discover that Colossus has been using a drug called &quot;Banshee&quot; to give him super-strength. Kurt is also seen to be part of Colossus&#x27; Banshee (Ultimatevers&#x27;s Mutant Growth Hormone) enhanced X-Men team. In this form, Nightcrawler seems to wield flare/batons of energy, similar to Blink&#x27;s javelins.

Ultimate Nightcrawler&#x27;s powers are very similar to his 616 counterpart. Kurt&#x27;s demon-like physiology grants him dark indigo skin (unlike the 616 version in which he is covered with a thin blue fur), a prehensile tail, superhuman acrobatic ability, and control over bonding between his molecules, which allows him to cling to any surface. Most notably, Nightcrawler can teleport short distances (although one teleport of two miles (3 km) was noted), leaving a burst of yellow smoke and flames. After use of the drug Banshee, Nightcrawler bursts purple (rather than yellow) smoke and flames when he teleports.

While heading to a theater with Angel, Beast, and Dazzler, Kurt is killed when the Ultimatum wave hits New York.

According to Nick Spencer, Nightcrawler will somehow be a supporting character in &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot;.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Nightcrawler and Mystique were members of the Opposition who are against the rules of the Rasputin family and were mentioned to have escaped from an East Berlin camp. Wolverine under his Winter Soldier alias was dispatched to deal with them. As the Opposition soldiers tried to take down Winter Soldier, Nightcrawler recited a poem from Psalm 23 before using a combination of his teleportation and his gun to try to take down Winter Soldier. Before he was taken down by Wolverine&#x27;s claws, Nightcrawler apologized to Winter Soldier for not getting to him faster.

===Universe X (Belasco)===
In the futuristic Universe X maxi-series by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross, it is revealed that Nightcrawler became amnesiac and was displaced in time, finally becoming Belasco, a long-time enemy of the X-Men. After his origins are revealed to him by a resurrected Captain Marvel, Nightcrawler/Belasco finally joins the good guys again.

It was originally stated in the original Earth X series that after surviving the tragedy that killed the rest of Excalibur, Nightcrawler lost his teleportation powers and eventually became human. In an ironic twist of fate, he was then killed by a group of superhumans affected by the Terrigen Mists for being human.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
Nightcrawler has made a number of appearances through the years in the &quot;What If?&quot; series, consisting of one-issue takes on potential alternative universes. Among his roles were &quot;What if the X-Men had stayed in Asgard?&quot; vol. 2 #12, in which Nightcrawler stayed behind on Asgard to be a swashbuckler and eventually joined the Warriors Three.

In &quot;What if the all-new, all-different X-Men had never existed?&quot;, an embittered Nightcrawler, having never been recruited by Professor Xavier, was talked into a life of crime by Erik the Red. However, after learning the truth about the X-Men, he sacrificed himself to destroy the Phoenix Force that was hiding in Earth&#x27;s sun, reasoning that, while heroes like the X-Men would be mourned by the world, nobody would miss him.

In &quot;What If Mystique had raised Nightcrawler?&quot;, Rogue&#x27;s attempt to free Nightcrawler from the attic where Mystique had kept him to &#x27;protect&#x27; him resulted in him being mortally injured by the Brotherhood when they mistook him for an X-Man, Rogue&#x27;s attempt to use his power to escape results in her permanently absorbing Nightcrawler&#x27;s powers and appearance due to the prolonged contact she maintained.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
In this reality of &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, Rogue has absorbed Nightcrawler&#x27;s abilities when he gave her mouth-to-mouth, granting her Nightcrawler&#x27;s skin and tail as well as exceptional athletic abilities, and leaving Nightcrawler with Rogue&#x27;s powers and looking like a normal human. He was left in a coma after he absorbed Thor&#x27;s powers during a fight with the Avengers, his body unable to cope with the strain of absorbing the power of a god, although Thor promised Mystique and Rogue that he would find a way to help Nightcrawler recover.

===&quot;X-Men Noir&quot;===
Set in &quot;Marvel Noir&quot;, Kurt Wagner aka The Demon appears in the sequel to &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, &quot;X-Men Noir: the Mark of Cain&quot;. Kurt is a human wearing a blue demon mask and a costume tail as well was an acrobat with sharpened nails, as well as an agent of the German-based Weapon X under his fiancée Jimaine Szardos (alias The Red Rose). Wagner betrayed the group and saved American spy Mimic/Calvin Rankin from fellow agents and vowed to get out of the country. Wagner was informed that Rankin himself was Weapon X, the prime target sought by Rose. Wagner apprehended and shot Szardos but not before she burned his face with a torch.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
Additionally, in &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, he is shown to be a famous Hollywood action star (with Jubilee as his agent), and is married to Kymri; the pair have children, including another T.J. Wagner (which is Nocturne&#x27;s name) however, in this timeline T.J. Wagner is a male. Nocturne is a character in this universe.

===&quot;X-2: X-Men United&quot;===
A tie-in comic to the 2003 film &quot;X-2: X-Men United&quot; depicts his background as a circus performer, where he was in love with Amanda Sefton, a fellow performer. When Amanda falls from her trapeze, Kurt breaks character and teleports to save her, breaking his own ribs in the process. Unconcerned with his injuries, Kurt learns that Amanda is involved with Werner, a more traditionally handsome performer, and goes to a church to grieve. While there, he&#x27;s confronted by Amanda, confessing her love to him and inviting him to elope. In fact, she is an illusion created by Mutant 12, who guides him to a Weapon X facility.

===Marvel Mangaverse===

<text>Orthomolecular medicine is a form of alternative medicine that claims to maintain human health through nutritional supplementation. It is rejected by evidence-based medicine. The concept builds on the idea of an optimal nutritional environment in the body and suggests that diseases reflect deficiencies in this environment. Treatment for disease, according to this view, involves attempts to correct &quot;imbalances or deficiencies based on individual biochemistry&quot; by use of substances such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, trace elements and fatty acids. The notions behind orthomolecular medicine are not supported by sound medical evidence, and the therapy is not effective for chronic disease prevention; even the validity of calling the orthomolecular approach a form of medicine has been questioned since the 1970s.

The approach is sometimes referred to as megavitamin therapy, because its practice evolved out of, and in some cases still uses, doses of vitamins and minerals many times higher than the recommended dietary intake. Orthomolecular practitioners may also incorporate a variety of other styles of treatment into their approaches, including dietary restriction, megadoses of non-vitamin nutrients and mainstream pharmaceutical drugs. Proponents argue that non-optimal levels of certain substances can cause health issues beyond simple vitamin deficiency and see balancing these substances as an integral part of health.

American chemist Linus Pauling coined the term &quot;orthomolecular&quot; in the 1960s to mean &quot;the right molecules in the right amounts&quot; (&quot;ortho-&quot; in Greek implies &quot;correct&quot;). Proponents of orthomolecular medicine hold that treatment must be based on each patient&#x27;s individual biochemistry.

The scientific and medical consensus holds that the broad claims of efficacy advanced by advocates of orthomolecular medicine are not adequately tested as drug therapies. It has been described as a form of food faddism and as quackery. There are specific narrow applications where mainstream research has supported benefits for nutrient supplementation, and where conventional medicine uses vitamin treatments for some diseases.

Some vitamins in large doses have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and death. The scientific consensus view is that for normal individuals, a balanced diet contains all necessary vitamins and minerals and that routine supplementation is not necessary outside of specific diagnosed deficiencies.

==History and development==
In the early 20th century, some doctors hypothesised that vitamins could cure disease, and supplements were prescribed in megadoses by the 1930s. Their effects on health were disappointing, though, and in the 1950s and 1960s, nutrition was de-emphasised in standard medical curricula. The word &quot;orthomolecular&quot; was coined by Linus Pauling in 1967.

Amongst the individuals described posthumously as orthomolecularists are Max Gerson, who developed a diet that he claimed could treat diseases, which the American Medical Association&#x27;s 1949 Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry found ineffective; and Evan Shute and his brother, who attempted to treat heart disease with vitamin E. Several concepts now cited by orthomolecularists, including individual biochemical variation and inborn errors of metabolism, debuted in scientific papers early in the 20th century.

In 1948, William McCormick theorized that vitamin C deficiency played an important role in many diseases and began to use large doses in patients. In the 1950s, Fred R. Klenner also tried vitamin C megadosage as a therapy for a wide range of illnesses, including polio. Irwin Stone stated that organisms that do not synthesise their own vitamin C due to a loss-of-function mutation have a disease he called &quot;hypoascorbemia&quot;. This term is not used by the medical community, and the idea of an organism-wide lack of a biosynthetic pathway as a disease was not endorsed by Stone&#x27;s contemporaries.

In the 1950s, some individuals believed that vitamin deficiencies caused mental illness. Psychiatrists Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer gave people having acute schizophrenic episodes high doses of niacin, while William Kaufman used niacinamide. While niacin has no known efficacy in psychiatric disease, the use of niacin in combination with statins and other medical therapies has become one of several medical treatments for cardiovascular disease.

In the late 1960s, Linus Pauling introduced the expression &quot;orthomolecular&quot; to express the idea of &quot;the right molecules in the right amounts&quot;. Since the first claims of medical breakthroughs with vitamin C by Pauling and others, findings on the health effects of vitamin C have been controversial and contradictory. Pauling&#x27;s claims have been criticised as overbroad.

Later research branched out into nutrients besides niacin and vitamin C, including essential fatty acids.

==Scope==
According to Abram Hoffer, orthomolecular medicine does not purport to treat all diseases, nor is it &quot;a replacement for standard treatment. A proportion of patients will require orthodox treatment, a proportion will do much better on orthomolecular treatment, and the rest will need a skillful blend of both.&quot; Nevertheless, advocates have said that the right nutrients at the optimum dose for the individual concerned can prevent, treat, and sometimes cure a wide range of medical conditions. Conditions for which orthomolecular practitioners have claimed some efficacy are: acne, alcoholism, allergies, arthritis, autism, bee stings, bipolar disorder, burns, cancer, the common cold, depression, drug addiction, drug overdose, epilepsy, heart diseases, heavy metal toxicity, acute hepatitis, herpes, hyperactivity, hypertension, hypoglycemia, influenza, learning disabilities, mental and metabolic disorders, migraine, mononucleosis, mushroom poisoning, neuropathy &amp; polyneuritis (including multiple sclerosis), osteoporosis, polio, a hypothesised condition called &quot;pyroluria&quot;, radiation sickness, Raynaud&#x27;s disease, mental retardation, schizophrenia, shock, skin problems, snakebite, spider bite, tetanus toxin and viral pneumonia.

==Orthomolecular psychiatry==

Hoffer believed that particular nutrients could cure mental illness. In the 1950s, he attempted to treat schizophrenia with niacin, although proponents of orthomolecular psychiatry say that the ideas behind their approach predate Hoffer. According to Hoffer and others who called themselves &quot;orthomolecular psychiatrists&quot;, psychiatric syndromes result from biochemical deficiencies, allergies, toxicities or several hypothetical contributing conditions which they termed pyroluria, histadelia and histapenia. These purported causes were said to be found during an &quot;individual biochemical workup&quot; and treated with megavitamin therapy and dietary changes including fasting. These diagnoses and treatments are not accepted by evidence-based medicine.

==Principles==
According to Abram Hoffer, &quot;primitive&quot; peoples do not consume processed foods and do not have &quot;degenerative&quot; diseases. In contrast, typical &quot;Western&quot; diets are said to be insufficient for long-term health, necessitating the use of megadose supplements of vitamins, dietary minerals, proteins, antioxidants, amino acids, ω-3 fatty acids, ω-6 fatty acids, medium-chain triglycerides, dietary fiber, short and long chain fatty acids, lipotropes, systemic and digestive enzymes, other digestive factors, and prohormones to ward off hypothetical metabolism anomalies at an early stage, before they cause disease.

Orthomolecularists say that they provide prescriptions for optimal amounts of micronutrients after individual diagnoses based on blood tests and personal histories. Lifestyle and diet changes may also be recommended. The battery of tests ordered includes many that are not considered useful by medicine.

==Prevalence==
Orthomolecular medicine is practiced by few medical practitioners.

A survey released in May, 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine focused on who used alternative medicine, what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults age 18 years and over during 2003. The survey reported uses in the previous twelve months that include orthomolecular related uses: Nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products 18.9%, Diet-based therapies 3.5%, Megavitamin therapy 2.8%.

Another recent CAM survey reported that 12% of liver disease patients used the antioxidant silymarin, more than 6% used vitamins, and that &quot;in all, 74% of patients reported using CAM in addition to the medications prescribed by their physician, but 26% did not inform their physician of their CAM use.&quot;

Even though the health benefits are not established, the use of high doses of vitamins is also common in people who have been diagnosed with cancer. According to Cancer Research UK, cancer patients should always seek professional advice before taking such supplements, and using them as a substitute for conventional treatment &quot;could be harmful to [their] health and greatly reduce the chance of curing or controlling [their] cancer&quot;.

==Medical and scientific reception==

===Methodology===
Orthomolecular therapies have been criticized as lacking a sufficient evidence base for clinical use: their scientific foundations are too weak, the studies that have been performed are too few and too open to interpretation, and reported positive findings in observational studies are contradicted by the results of more rigorous clinical trials. Accordingly, &quot;there is no evidence that orthomolecular medicine is effective&quot;. Proponents of orthomolecular medicine strongly dispute this statement by citing studies demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments involving vitamins, though this ignores the belief that a normal diet will provide adequate nutrients to avoid deficiencies, and that orthomolecular treatments are not actually related to vitamin deficiency. The lack of scientifically rigorous testing of orthomolecular medicine has led to its practices being classed with other forms of alternative medicine and regarded as unscientific. It has been described as food faddism and quackery, with critics arguing that it is based upon an &quot;exaggerated belief in the effects of nutrition upon health and disease.&quot; Orthomolecular practitioners will often use dubious diagnostic methods to define what substances are &quot;correct&quot;; one example is hair analysis, which produces spurious results when used in this fashion.

Proponents of orthomolecular medicine contend that, unlike some other forms of alternative medicine such as homeopathy, their ideas are at least biologically based, do not involve magical thinking, and are capable of generating testable hypotheses. &quot;Orthomolecular&quot; is not a standard medical term, and clinical use of specific nutrients is considered a form of chemoprevention (to prevent or delay development of disease) or chemotherapy (to treat an existing condition).

Despite a lack of evidence for its efficacy, interest in intravenous high dose vitamin C therapy has not been permanently extinguished, and some research groups continue to investigate whether it has an effect as a possible cancer treatment.

===Views on safety and efficacy===
In general, the vitamin megadoses advocated by orthomolecular medicine are unsupported by scientific consensus. Some vitamins such as vitamins ADEK are toxic in high doses, including niacin (B3), cholecalciferol (D) and tocopherol (E). The view of the medical community is that there is no evidence for the efficacy of Orthomolecular medicine as a treatment for cancer, and that high vitamin doses may – on the contrary – increase overall mortality. Nutritional treatments are not generally accepted as being helpful for psychological health. Its claims have been criticized by most medical organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute of Mental Health, the American Academy of Pediatrics, CHAMPUS, and the Canadian Paediatric Society. The American Medical Association describes as &quot;myths&quot; the ideas that adequate nutrition is not readily achievable with normal food, all food grown with pesticide is poisonous, all food additives are poisonous, vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common, that the cause of most disease is poor diet, which can be prevented by nutritional supplements.
Similarly, the American Cancer Society comments that the current scientific evidence does not &quot;support use of orthomolecular therapy for most of the conditions for which it is promoted.&quot; Some supplements have exhibited benefits for specific conditions, while a few have been confirmed to be harmful; the consumption of nutritious foods is the best recognized method to obtain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients crucial for good health. Barrie Cassileth, an adviser on alternative medicine to the National Institutes of Health, stated that &quot;scientific research has found no benefit from orthomolecular therapy for any disease,&quot; and medical textbooks also report that there is &quot;no evidence that megavitamin or orthomolecular therapy is effective in treating any disease.&quot;

A 1973 task force of the American Psychiatric Association unanimously concluded:
This review and critique has carefully examined the literature produced by megavitamin proponents and by those who have attempted to replicate their basic and clinical work. It concludes in this regard that the credibility of the megavitamin proponents is low. Their credibility is further diminished by a consistent refusal over the past decade to perform controlled experiments and to report their new results in a scientifically acceptable fashion. Under these circumstances this Task Force considers the massive publicity which they promulgate via radio, the lay press and popular books, using catch phrases which are really misnomers like &quot;megavitamin therapy&quot; and &quot;orthomolecular treatment&quot;, to be deplorable.

In response to claims that orthomolecular medicine could cure childhood psychoses and learning disorders, the American Academy of Pediatrics labelled orthomolecular medicine a &quot;cult&quot; in 1976.

Proponents of orthomolecular medicine counter that some vitamins and nutrients are now used in medicine as treatments for specific diseases, such as megadose niacin and fish oil for dyslipidemias, and megavitamin therapies for a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism. A review in the &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; concluded that while some therapies might be beneficial, others might be harmful or interfere with effective medical therapy. A recent study of over 161,000 individuals provided, in the words of the authors, &quot;convincing evidence that multivitamin use has little or no influence on the risk of common cancers, cardiovascular disease, or total mortality in postmenopausal women.&quot; A recent meta-analysis in &quot;JAMA&quot; suggested that supplementation with combinations of antioxidant vitamins (beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E) may increase mortality, although with respect to beta-carotene this conclusion may be due to the known harmful effect in smokers.

====Safety====
In the United States, pharmaceuticals must be proven safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA before they can be marketed, whereas dietary supplements must be proven &quot;unsafe&quot; before regulatory action can be taken. A number of orthomolecular supplements are available in the US in pharmaceutical versions that are sometimes quite similar in strength and general content, or in other countries are regulated as pharmaceuticals. The US regulations also have provisions to recognize a general level of safety for established nutrients that can forgo new drug safety tests. Proponents of orthomolecular medicine argue that supplements are less likely to cause dangerous side-effects or harm, since they are normally present in the body. Some vitamins are toxic in high doses and nearly all (with the possible exception of Vitamin C) will cause adverse effects given high levels of overdosing for prolonged periods as recommended by orthomolecular practitioners. Forgoing medical care in favor of orthomolecular treatments can lead to adverse health outcomes.

Health professionals see orthomolecular medicine as encouraging individuals to dose themselves with large amounts of vitamins and other nutrients without conventional supervision, which they worry might be damaging to health. Potential risks of inappropriate vitamin and supplement regimes include an increased risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, thrombophlebitis, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, neurological effects, liver toxicity, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, gouty arthritis, jaundice, kidney stones, and diarrhea. In their book &quot;Trick or Treatment?&quot;, Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh conclude that &quot;The concepts of orthomolecular medicine are not biologically plausible and not supported by the results of rigorous clinical trials. These problems are compounded by the fact that orthomolecular medicine can cause harm and is often very expensive.&quot;

===Example: vitamin E===
Orthomolecular proponents claim that even large doses of vitamin E pose no risk to health and are useful for the treatment and prevention of a broad list of conditions, including heart and circulatory diseases, diabetes and nephritis. Initial hopes for the usefulness of vitamin E in orthomolecular medicine were based on epidemiological studies suggesting that people who consumed more vitamin E had lower risks of chronic disease, such as coronary heart disease. These observational studies could not distinguish between whether the higher levels of vitamin E improved health themselves, or whether confounding variables (such as other dietary factors or exercise) were responsible. To distinguish between these possibilities, a number of randomized controlled trials were performed and meta-analysis of these controlled clinical trials have not shown any clear benefit from any form of vitamin E supplementation for preventing chronic disease. Further clinical studies show no benefit of vitamin E supplements for cardiovascular disease. The current position of the American National Institutes of Health is that there is no convincing evidence that vitamin E supplements can prevent or treat any disease.

Beyond the lack of apparent benefit, a series of three meta-analyses reported that vitamin E supplementation is associated with an increased risk of death; one of the meta-analyses performed by the Cochrane Collaboration also found significantly increased mortality for the antioxidant vitamins A and beta-carotene. A subsequent meta-analysis found no mortality benefit from vitamin E, but also no increase in mortality either.

===Use in AIDS===
Several articles in the alternative-medicine literature have suggested that orthomolecular-related dietary supplementation might be helpful for patients with HIV/AIDS. 
A study using 250 mg and 1000 mg doses of vitamin C along with other antioxidants to treat people with AIDS did not find any benefit.

A meta analysis in 2010 (updated in 2017 with different results) found that micronutrient supplementation decreased the risk of death and improved outcomes in pregnant women with HIV in Africa. A 2017 Cochrane review found no strong evidence to suggest that micronutrient supplementation prevents death or is effective at slowing the progression of disease for adults with HIV. It is important for people living with HIV to eat a healthy adequate diet. For people with HIV that have clinically demonstrated deficiencies in micronutrients or for people who are not able to consume the recommended daily quantities of minerals and vitamins, supplementation is still encouraged. Vitamin A in children with HIV appears to be safe and beneficial. Vitamin A deficiency is found in children with HIV infection who may or may not have symptoms of AIDS. Vitamin A supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality in AIDS symptomatic children, but has no effect on asymptomatic children. It does not prevent HIV infection, cannot treat the chronic HIV infection, and will not cure AIDS.

====Deaths resulting from illegal vitamin trials in South Africa====

Matthias Rath has been extensively criticized for presenting his vitamin supplements as a treatment for AIDS and for testing them in illegal trials in South Africa. A former associate of Linus Pauling, Rath has promoted vitamins as a treatment for HIV infection, describing treatment with effective antiretroviral drugs as toxic and part of a global conspiracy serving the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry. In a lawsuit that found against Rath, the South African Medical Association blamed his vitamin products for several deaths. The World Health Organization and two health agencies of the United Nations also described Rath&#x27;s advertisements as &quot;wrong and misleading&quot; and &quot;an irresponsible attack on ARV (antiretroviral) therapy.&quot; The South African Centre for Social Science Research described the trials as &quot;state sponsored pseudo-science&quot;. Rath&#x27;s trials, conducted with the aid of AIDS denialist David Rasnick, were declared unlawful by the Cape High Court; Rath, Rasnick and their foundation were barred from conducting further unauthorised clinical trials and from advertising their products.

===Alleged institutional bias===
Advocates of orthomolecular medicine, including Pauling, Hoffer and Ewan Cameron have claimed that their findings are actively suppressed by the medical and pharmaceutical industry. Hoffer wrote &quot;There is no conspiracy led and directed by a single person or by a single organization. There is no Mafia in psychiatry. However, there is a conspiracy led and directed by a large number of professionals and their associations who have a common aim to protect their hard-earned orthodoxy, no matter what the cost to their opponent colleagues or to their patients.&quot;

The &quot;Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine&quot;, founded in 1967 as the &quot;Journal of Schizophrenia&quot;, is a major publication of orthomolecular medicine. As Abram Hoffer wrote:
:We had to create our own journals because it was impossible to obtain entry into the official journals of psychiatry and medicine. Before 1967 I had not found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and by then I had about 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.

Other members of the medical community deny the existence of such an institutional prejudice. A review in the &quot;Journal of Clinical Oncology&quot; denied that physicians collude against unconventional treatments. Claims of conspiracy were limited to the now defunct Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine. In its current iteration, the Linus Pauling Institute derives a significant amount of funding from the National Institutes of Health and other federal sources.

<text>In computer hardware a host controller, host adapter or host bus adapter (HBA) connects a computer system bus which acts as the host system to other network and storage devices. The terms are primarily used to refer to devices for connecting SCSI, SAS, NVMe, Fibre Channel and SATA devices. Devices for connecting to FireWire, USB and other devices may also be called host controllers or host adapters.

Host adapters can be integrated in the motherboard or be on a separate expansion card.

The term network interface controller (NIC) is more often used for devices connecting to computer networks, while the term converged network adapter can be applied when protocols such as iSCSI or Fibre Channel over Ethernet allow storage and network functionality over the same physical connection.

==SCSI==
A connects a host system and a peripheral SCSI device or storage system. These adapters manage service and task communication between the host and target. Typically a device driver, linked to the operating system, controls the host adapter itself.

In a typical parallel SCSI subsystem, each device has assigned to it a unique numerical ID. As a rule, the host adapter appears as SCSI ID 7, which gives it the highest priority on the SCSI bus (priority descends as the SCSI ID descends; on a 16-bit or &quot;wide&quot; bus, ID 8 has the lowest priority, a feature that maintains compatibility with the priority scheme of the 8-bit or &quot;narrow&quot; bus).

The host adapter usually assumes the role of SCSI initiator, in that it issues commands to other SCSI devices.

A computer can contain more than one host adapter, which can greatly increase the number of SCSI devices available.

Major SCSI adapter manufacturers are HP, ATTO Technology, Promise Technology, Adaptec, and LSI Corporation. LSI, Adaptec, and ATTO offer PCIe SCSI adapters which fit in Apple Mac, on Intel PCs, and low-profile motherboards which lack SCSI support due to the inclusion of SAS and/or SATA connectivity.

==Fibre Channel==

The term &quot;host bus adapter&quot; (HBA) may be used to refer to a Fibre Channel interface card. In this case, it allows devices in a Fibre Channel storage area network to communicate data between each otherit may connect a server to a switch or storage device, connect multiple storage systems, or connect multiple servers. Fibre Channel HBAs are available for open systems, computer architectures, and buses, including PCI and SBus (obsolete today).

Each Fibre Channel HBA has a unique World Wide Name (WWN), which is similar to an Ethernet MAC address in that it uses an OUI assigned by the IEEE. However, WWNs are longer (8 bytes). There are two types of WWNs on a HBA; a node WWN (WWNN), which is shared by all ports on a host bus adapter, and a port WWN (WWPN), which is unique to each port. There are HBA models of different speeds: 1 Gbit/s, 2 Gbit/s, 4 Gbit/s, 8 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, 16 Gbit/s, 20 Gbit/s and 32 Gbit/s.

The major Fibre Channel HBA manufacturers are QLogic and Broadcom. As of mid-2009, these vendors shared approximately 90% of the market. Other manufacturers include Agilent, ATTO, and Brocade.

HBA is also known to be interpreted as High Bandwidth Adapter in cases of Fibre Channel controllers.

==InfiniBand==
The term (HCA) is usually used to describe InfiniBand interface cards.

==ATA==
ATA host adapters are integrated into motherboards of most modern PCs. They are often improperly called &quot;disk controllers&quot;. The correct term for the component that allows a computer to talk to a peripheral bus is &quot;host adapter&quot; . A proper disk controller only allows a &quot;disk&quot; to talk to the same bus.

==SAS and SATA==
SAS or serial-attached SCSI is the current connectivity to replace the previous generation parallel-attached SCSI (PAS) devices. Ultra320 was the highest level of parallel SCSI available, but SAS has since replaced it as the highest-performing SCSI technology.

SATA is a similar technology from the aspect of connection options. HBAs can be created using a single connector to connect both SAS and SATA devices.

Major SAS/SATA adapter manufacturers are Promise Technologies, Adaptec, HP, QLogic, Areca, LSI and ATTO Technology.

===eSATA===
External Serial ATA (eSATA) disk enclosures and drives are available in the consumer computing market, but not all SATA-compatible motherboards and disk controllers include eSATA ports. As such, adapters to connect eSATA devices to ports on an internal SATA bus are available.

==Mainframe channel I/O==

In the mainframe field, the terms &quot;host adapter&quot; or &quot;host bus adapter&quot; were traditionally not used.
A similar goal was achieved since the 1960s with channel I/O, a separate processor that can access main memory independently, in parallel with CPU (like later DMA in personal computer field), and that executes its own I/O-dedicated programs when pointed to such by the controlling CPU.

Protocols used by channel I/O to communicate with peripheral devices include ESCON and newer FICON.

<text>Advil is primarily a brand of ibuprofen (a pain reliever in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug category). Advil has been called a &quot;megabrand&quot; because it offers various &quot;products for a wide range of pain, head cold, and sleep problems.&quot;

==History==
The brand first entered the American market in 1984 through Whitehall (itself a division of Wyeth, which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009), the same year ibuprofen gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for over-the-counter (OTC) sales in the United States (being available via prescription since 1974). Within ten years of having a market presence, it outsold Bayer Aspirin and was a fierce competitor to Tylenol (primarily a brand of acetaminophen). In the mid-1990s, for example, it held 13% of the multibillion-dollar over-the-counter American market for analgesics.

==Varieties==

In 2023, there were 23 varieties of Advil available on the U.S. market including:

*Advil
*Advil Liqui-Gels
*Advil Migraine Liqui-Gels
*Infant&#x27;s Advil
*Pediatric Advil
*Junior Strength Advil
*Children&#x27;s Advil
*Flavored Children&#x27;s Advil
*Advil Dual Action With Acetaminophen (Ibuprofen/acetaminophen)
*Advil PM (with Diphenhydramine)
*Advil Cold And Sinus (with Pseudoephedrine)
*Advil Congestion Relief (with Phenylephrine)
*Advil Allergy Sinus (with Chlorpheniramine and Pseudoephedrine)
*Advil Allergy And Congestion Relief (with Chlorpheniramine and Phenylephrine)
*Advil Multi-Symptom Cold &amp; Flu (with Chlorpheniramine and Phenylephrine)
*Children&#x27;s Advil Cold (with Pseudoephedrine)
*Children&#x27;s Advil Allergy Sinus (with Chlorpheniramine and Pseudoephedrine)

==Marketing==
Marketing campaigns for the brand (some including celebrities like Regis Philbin) have pushed slogans such as &quot;Take Action. Take Advil.&quot; and have been presented under the premise of &quot;True Advil Stories&quot;; the brand has also been involved in sponsorship deals such as with Major League Pickleball.

<doc id="328003" wikidata="Q3536511" url="?curid=328003" title="MacAlpin's treason">
<text>MacAlpin&#x27;s treason is a medieval legend which explains the replacement of the Pictish language by Gaelic in the 9th and 10th centuries.

The legend tells of the murder of the nobles of Pictavia (situated in modern-day Scotland). Kenneth MacAlpin&#x27;s mother was probably descended from the royal house of Fortriu and his great-grand uncle, Alpín, had reigned as kings of the Picts until deposed by Óengus in 728. As the Picts were a matrilineal society, it is thus that Kenneth was one of several nobles with a claim to the crown of the Picts and Scots.

== Historical sources ==
The sources of Kenneth MacAlpin becoming king of the Picts are few and suspect. Two such sources, &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; and &quot;De instructione principis&quot;, note that in 841 MacAlpin attacked the remnants of the Pictish army and defeated them. MacAlpin then invited the Pictish king, Drest X, and the remaining Pictish nobles to Scone to settle the issue of Dál Riata&#x27;s freedom or MacAlpin&#x27;s claim to the Dál Riatan crown. Faced with a recently victorious MacAlpin in the south and a devastated army in the north, Drest, as well as all claimants to the Pictish throne from the seven royal houses attended this meeting at Scone. Legend has it that the Gaels came secretly armed to Scone, where Drest and the Pictish nobles were killed.

It is Giraldus Cambrensis in &quot;De Instructione Principis&quot; who recounts how a great banquet was held at Scone, and the Pictish king and his nobles were plied with drinks and became quite drunk. Once the Picts were drunk, the Gaels allegedly pulled bolts from the benches, trapping the Picts in concealed earthen hollows under the benches; additionally, the traps were set with sharp blades, such that the falling Picts d themselves.

&quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; tells that MacAlpin plunged them in the pitted earth, sown with deadly blades. Trapped and unable to defend themselves, the surviving Picts were then murdered from above and their bodies, clothes and ornaments plundered.

Following this event, Kenneth MacAlpin became king of both realms, harking back to his maternal ancestry to establish his claim to the throne of Pictavia and inheriting Dál Riada from his father. He merged the two into one kingdom named Alba.

<doc id="328012" wikidata="Q4928046" url="?curid=328012" title="Bloody">
<text>Bloody, as an adjective or adverb, is an expletive attributive commonly used in British English, Irish English, New Zealand English and Australian English; it is also present in Canadian English, Indian English, Malaysian/Singaporean English, Hawaiian English, South African English, and a number of other Commonwealth of nations. It has been used as an intensive since at least the 1670s. Considered respectable until about 1750, it was heavily tabooed during c. 1750–1920, considered equivalent to heavily obscene or profane speech. Public use continued to be seen as controversial until the 1960s, but the word has since become a comparatively mild expletive or intensifier.

In American English, the word is used almost exclusively in its literal sense to describe something that is covered in blood; when used as an intensifier, it is seen by American audiences as a stereotypical marker of a British- or Irish-English speaker, without any significant obscene or profane connotations. Canadian English usage is similar to American English, but use as an expletive adverb may be considered slightly vulgar depending on the circumstances.

Use of the adjective &quot;bloody&quot; as a profane intensifier predates the 18th century. Its ultimate origin is unclear, and several hypotheses have been suggested. It may be a direct loan of Dutch &quot;bloote&quot;, (modern spelling blote) meaning &quot;entire&quot;, &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;, which was suggested by Ker (1837) to have been &quot;transformed into &quot;bloody&quot;, in the consequently absurd phrases of &quot;bloody good&quot;, &quot;bloody bad&quot;, &quot;bloody thief&quot;, &quot;bloody angry&quot;, etc., where it simply implies completely, entirely, purely, very, truly, and has no relation to either blood or murder, except by corruption of the word.&quot;

The word &quot;blood&quot; in Dutch and German is used as part of minced oaths, in abbreviation of expressions referring to &quot;God&#x27;s blood&quot;, i.e. the Passion or the Eucharist. Ernest Weekley (1921) relates English usage to imitation of purely intensive use of Dutch &quot;bloed&quot; and German &quot;Blut&quot; in the early modern period.

Paradoxically, though, even though the word &quot;bloody&quot; has Germanic origins, its use as a swear word most likely entered English from the French, or, more specifically, the Anglo Norman language, the dialect of French spoken in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066. According to Emily Reed (2018), &quot;sanglant&quot; (meaning &quot;bloody&quot;) was used as an expletive in Anglo Norman, with published examples dating back to 1396. In that year, two examples of such insults appeared in &quot;Manières de langage&quot;, a medieval textbook for French-language learners. Subsequent publications (the French farce &quot;Pathelin&quot; and the &quot;Chronique de Charles VII&quot;) indicate that the word was commonly used as an insult in the Norman dialect of French spoken in England.

A popularly reported theory suggested euphemistic derivation from the phrase &quot;by Our Lady&quot;. The contracted form &quot;by&#x27;r Lady&quot; is common in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays around the turn of the 17th century, and Jonathan Swift about 100 years later writes both &quot;it grows by&#x27;r Lady cold&quot; and &quot;it was bloody hot walking to-day&quot; suggesting that &quot;bloody&quot; and &quot;by&#x27;r Lady&quot; had become exchangeable generic intensifiers.
However, Eric Partridge (1933) describes the supposed derivation of &quot;bloody&quot; as a further contraction of &quot;by&#x27;r lady&quot; as &quot;phonetically implausible&quot;. 

According to &quot;Rawson&#x27;s dictionary of Euphemisms&quot; (1995), attempts to derive &quot;bloody&quot; from minced oaths for &quot;by our lady&quot; or &quot;God&#x27;s blood&quot; are based on the attempt to explain the word&#x27;s extraordinary shock power in the 18th to 19th centuries, but they disregard that the earliest records of the word as an intensifier in the 17th to early 18th century do not reflect any taboo or profanity. It seems more likely, according to Rawson, that the taboo against the word arose secondarily, perhaps because of an association with menstruation.

The Oxford English Dictionary mentions the theory that it may have arisen from aristocratic rowdies known as &quot;bloods&quot;, hence &quot;bloody drunk&quot; means &quot;drunk as a blood&quot;.

==History of use==
Until at least the early 18th century, the word was used innocuously. It was used as an intensifier without apparent implication of profanity by 18th-century authors such as Henry Fielding and Jonathan Swift (&quot;It was bloody hot walking today&quot; in 1713) and Samuel Richardson (&quot;He is bloody passionate&quot; in 1742).

After about 1750 the word assumed more profane connotations. Johnson (1755) already calls it &quot;very vulgar&quot;, and the original Oxford English Dictionary article of 1888 comments the word is &quot;now constantly in the mouths of the lowest classes, but by respectable people considered &#x27;a horrid word&#x27;, on a par with obscene or profane language&quot;.

On the opening night of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s comedy &quot;Pygmalion&quot; in 1914, Mrs Patrick Campbell, in the role of Eliza Doolittle, created a sensation with the line &quot;Walk! Not bloody likely!&quot; and this led to a fad for using &quot;Pygmalion&quot; itself as a pseudo-oath, as in &quot;Not Pygmalion likely&quot;.

==Usage outside the UK==

===Australia/New Zealand===
&quot;Bloody&quot; has always been a very common part of Australian and New Zealand speech and has not been considered profane there for some time.. The word was dubbed &quot;the Australian adjective&quot; by &quot;The Bulletin&quot; on 18 August 1894. One Australian performer, Kevin Bloody Wilson, has even made it his middle name. Also in Australia, the word &quot;bloody&quot; is frequently used as a verbal hyphen, or infix, correctly called tmesis as in &quot;fanbloodytastic&quot;. In the 1940s an Australian divorce court judge held that &quot;the word &quot;bloody&quot; is so common in modern parlance that it is not regarded as swearing&quot;. Meanwhile, Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s government was fining Britons for using the word in public. In 2007 an Australian advertising campaign So where the bloody hell are you? was banned on UK televisions and billboards as the term was still considered an expletive.

===United States===
The word as an expletive is seldom used in the United States of America. In the US the term is usually used when the intention is to mimic an Englishman. Because it is not perceived as profane in American English, &quot;bloody&quot; is not censored when used in American television and film, for example in the 1961 film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; the actor Richard Harris at one point says: &quot;You can&#x27;t even see the bloody cave, let alone the bloody guns. And anyway, we haven&#x27;t got a bloody bomb big enough to smash that bloody rock ...&quot; – but &quot;bloody&quot; was replaced with &quot;ruddy&quot; for British audiences of the time.

===Canada===
The term &quot;bloody&quot; as an intensifier is now overall fairly rare in Canada, though still more common than in the United States. It is more commonly spoken in the Atlantic provinces, particularly Newfoundland and Labrador. It may be considered mildly vulgar depending on the circumstances.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the word &quot;bloody&quot; is commonly used as a mild expletive in Singapore&#x27;s colloquial English. The roots of this expletive derives from the influence and informal language British officers used during the dealing and training of soldiers in the Singapore Volunteer Corps and the early days of the Singapore Armed Forces. When more Singaporeans were promoted officers within the Armed Forces, most new local officers applied similar training methods their former British officers had when they were cadets or trainees themselves. This includes some aspects of British Army lingo, like &quot;bloody (something)&quot;. When the newly elected Singapore government implemented compulsory conscription, all 18-year-old able bodied Singapore males had to undergo training within the Armed Forces. When National servicemen completed their service term, some brought the many expletives they picked up during their service into the civilian world and thus became a part of the common culture in the city state.

=== Malaysia ===
The word &quot;bloody&quot; also managed to spread up north in neighbouring Malaysia, to where the influence of Singapore English has spread. The use of &quot;bloody&quot; as a substitute for more explicit language increased with the popularity of British and Australian films and television shows aired on local television programmes. The term &quot;bloody&quot; in Singapore may not be considered explicit, but its usage is frowned upon in formal settings.

===South Africa===
The term is frequently used among South Africans in their colloquial English and it is an intensifier. It is used in both and non-explicit ways. It also spread to Afrikaans as &quot;bloedige&quot; and is popular amongst many citizens in the country. It is also used by minors and is not considered to be offensive. 

===India===
The term is also frequently used as a mild expletive or an intensifier in India.

==Euphemisms==
Many substitutions were devised to convey the essence of the oath, but with less offence; these included &quot;bleeding&quot;, &quot;bleaking&quot;, &quot;cruddy&quot;, &quot;smuddy&quot;, &quot;blinking&quot;, &quot;blooming&quot;, &quot;bally&quot;, &quot;woundy&quot;, &quot; flaming&quot; and &quot;ruddy&quot;.

Publications such as newspapers, police reports, and so on may print &quot;b⸺y&quot; instead of the full profanity. 
A spoken language equivalent is &quot;blankety&quot; or, less frequently, &quot;blanked&quot; or &quot;blanky&quot;; the spoken words are all variations of &quot;blank&quot;, which, as a verbal representation of a dash, is used as a euphemism for a variety of &quot;bad&quot; words.

==In composition==
Use of &quot;bloody&quot; as an adverbial or generic intensifier is to be distinguished from its fixed use in the expressions &quot;bloody murder&quot; and &quot;bloody hell&quot;. In &quot;bloody murder&quot;, it has the original sense of an adjective used literally. The King James Version of the Bible frequently uses &quot;bloody&quot; as an adjective in reference to bloodshed or violent crime, as in &quot;bloody crimes&quot; (Ezekiel 22:2), &quot;Woe to the bloody city&quot; (Ezekiel 24:6, Nahum 3:1). &quot;bloody men&quot; (26:9, Psalms 59:2, 139:19), etc. The expression of &quot;bloody murder&quot; goes back to at least Elizabethan English, as in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (c. 1591), &quot;bloody murder or detested rape&quot;.
The expression &quot;scream bloody murder&quot; (in the figurative or desemanticised sense of &quot;to loudly object to something&quot; attested since c. 1860) is now considered American English, while in British English, the euphemistic &quot;blue murder&quot; had replaced &quot;bloody murder&quot; during the period of &quot;bloody&quot; being considered taboo.

The expression &quot;bloody hell&quot; is now used as a general expression of surprise or as a general intensifier; e.g. &quot;bloody hell&quot; being used repeatedly in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001, PG Rating). In March 2006 Australia&#x27;s national tourism commission, Tourism Australia, launched an advertising campaign targeted at potential visitors in several English-speaking countries. The ad sparked controversy because of its ending (in which a cheerful, bikini-clad spokeswoman delivers the ad&#x27;s call-to-action by saying &quot;...so where the bloody hell are you?&quot;). In the UK the BACC required that a modified version of the ad be shown in the United Kingdom, without the word &quot;bloody&quot;. In May 2006 the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the word &quot;bloody&quot; was not an inappropriate marketing tool and the original version of the ad was permitted to air. In Canada, the ad&#x27;s use of &quot;bloody hell&quot; also created controversy.

The longer &quot;bloody hell-hounds&quot; appears to have been at least printable in early 19th century Britain. &quot;Bloody hell&#x27;s flames&quot; as well as &quot;bloody hell&quot; is reported as a profanity supposedly used by Catholics against Protestants in 1845.

<doc id="328014" wikidata="Q112284" url="?curid=328014" title="Charles Duke">
<text>Charles Moss Duke Jr. (born October 3, 1935) is an American former astronaut, United States Air Force (USAF) officer and test pilot. As Lunar Module pilot of Apollo 16 in 1972, he became the tenth and youngest person to walk on the Moon, at age 36 years and 201 days. He is one of four surviving Moon walkers, along with David Scott, Buzz Aldrin and Jack Schmitt.

A 1957 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Duke joined the USAF and completed advanced flight training on the F-86 Sabre at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, where he was a distinguished graduate. After completion of this training, Duke served three years as a fighter pilot with the 526th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. After graduating from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in September 1965, he stayed on as an instructor teaching control systems and flying in the F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter, and T-33 Shooting Star.

In April 1966, Duke was one of nineteen men selected for NASA&#x27;s fifth astronaut group. In 1969, he was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10. He served as CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the first crewed landing on the Moon. His distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world, as the voice of Mission Control concerned by the long landing that almost expended all of the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; descent stage&#x27;s propellant. Duke&#x27;s first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were: &quot;Roger, Twank...Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We&#x27;re breathing again. Thanks a lot!&quot;

Duke was backup Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 13. Shortly before the mission, he caught rubella (German measles) from a friend&#x27;s child and inadvertently exposed the prime crew to the disease. As Ken Mattingly had no natural immunity to the disease, he was replaced as command module pilot by Jack Swigert. Mattingly was reassigned as command module pilot of Duke&#x27;s flight, Apollo 16. On this mission, Duke and John Young landed at the Descartes Highlands, and conducted three extravehicular activities (EVAs). He served as backup Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 17. Duke retired from NASA on January 1, 1976.

Following his retirement from NASA, Duke entered the Air Force Reserve and served as a mobilization augmentee to the Commander, USAF Basic Military Training Center, and to the Commander, USAF Recruiting Service. He graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1978. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, and retired in June 1986. He has logged 4,147 hours&#x27; flying time, of which 3,632 hours were in jet aircraft, and 265 hours were in space, including 21 hours and 38 minutes of EVA.

==Early life and education==
Charles Moss Duke Jr. was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 3, 1935, the son of Charles Moss Duke, an insurance salesman, and his wife Willie Catherine Waters, who worked as a buyer for Best &amp; Co. He was followed six minutes later by his identical twin brother William Waters (Bill) Duke. His mother traced her ancestry back to Colonel Philemon Waters, who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, brought the United States into World War II, his father volunteered to join the Navy, and was assigned to Naval Air Station North Island in California. The family moved to California to join him, but after a year he was shipped out to the South Pacific, and Willie took the boys to Johnston, South Carolina, where her mother lived. His father returned from the South Pacific in 1944, and was stationed at Naval Air Station Daytona Beach, so the family moved there. In 1946, after the war ended, they settled in Lancaster, South Carolina, where his father sold insurance, and his mother ran a dress shop. A sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), was born in 1949.
As a boy, Duke and his brother Bill made model aircraft. A congenital heart defect caused Bill to drop out of strenuous sports, and eventually inspired him to pursue a career in medicine, but golf was a sport that they enjoyed together. Duke was active in the Boy Scouts of America and earned its highest rank, Eagle Scout in 1946. He attended Lancaster High School. Duke decided that he would like to pursue a military career. Since his father had served in the Navy, he wanted to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

As a first step, Duke went to see his local congressman, James P. Richards, who lived in Lancaster. Richards said that he would be pleased to give Duke his nomination, as a local boy. Richards advised Duke that he would still need to pass the entrance examination, and recommended that he attend a military prep school. Duke and his parents accepted this advice, and chose the Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida, for his final two years of schooling. Duke sat the examination for Annapolis in the middle of his senior year, and soon after received a letter informing him that he had passed, and had been accepted into the class of 1957. The &quot;Lancaster News&quot; ran his picture on the front page along with the announcement of his acceptance. He graduated from Farragut as valedictorian and president of the senior class in 1953.

Duke entered the Naval Academy in June 1953. He was no athlete, but played golf for the academy team. During a two-month summer cruise to Europe on the escort carrier , he suffered from seasickness, and began questioning his decision to join the Navy. On the other hand, he greatly enjoyed a familiarization flight in an N3N seaplane, and began thinking of a career in aviation. The United States Air Force Academy had just been established and would not graduate its first class until 1959, so up to a quarter of the Annapolis class were permitted to volunteer for the United States Air Force. In fact, more than a quarter of the class of 1957 did so, and names were drawn from a hat. At his commissioning physical, Duke was shocked to find that he had a minor astigmatism in his right eye, which precluded him from becoming a naval aviator, but the Air Force said that it would still take him. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in naval sciences in June 1957, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force.

==Air Force==
In July 1957, Duke, along with the other graduates of Annapolis and West Point who had chosen the Air Force, reported to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, for two weeks&#x27; orientation. He was then sent to Spence Air Force Base in Moultrie, Georgia, for primary flight training. The first three months involved classwork and training with the T-34 Mentor, while the next three were with the T-28 Trojan; both were propeller-driven aircraft. For the next phase of his training, he went to Webb Air Force Base in Big Spring, Texas, in March 1958 for training with the T-33 Shooting Star, a jet aircraft. He graduated near the top of his class, and received his wings and a certificate identifying him as a distinguished graduate, which gave him a choice of assignments. He chose to become a fighter pilot. He completed six months&#x27; advanced training on the F-86 Sabre aircraft at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Georgia, where he was also a distinguished graduate.
Once again, Duke had his choice of assignments, and chose the 526th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. This was at the height of the Cold War, and tensions ran high, especially during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Duke chose the assignment precisely because it was the front line. Four of the 526th&#x27;s F-86 (and later F-102 Delta Dagger) fighter-interceptors were always on alert, ready to scramble and intercept aircraft crossing the border from East Germany.

As his three-year tour of duty in Europe came to an end, Duke considered that his best career option was to further his education, something that the USAF was encouraging. He applied to study aeronautical engineering at North Carolina State University, but this was not available. Instead, he was offered a place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in its Master of Science degree course in aeronautics and astronautics. He entered MIT in June 1962.

It was in Boston that he met Dotty Meade Claiborne, a graduate of Hollins College and the University of North Carolina, who had recently returned from a summer trip to Europe. They became engaged on Christmas Day, 1962, and were married by her uncle, Randolph Claiborne, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta, in the Cathedral of Saint Philip, on June 1, 1963. They went to Jamaica for their honeymoon, but came down with food poisoning.

While he was courting Dotty, Duke&#x27;s grades had slipped, and he was placed on scholastic probation, but the USAF allowed him to enroll for another term. For his dissertation, Duke teamed up with a classmate, Mike Jones, to perform statistical analysis for the Project Apollo guidance systems. As part of this work, they got to meet astronaut Charles Bassett. Their work earned them an A, bringing his average up to the required B, and he was awarded his Master of Science degree in May 1964.

For his next assignment, Duke applied for the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS), although he felt his chances of admission were slim given that he only barely met the minimum qualification. Nonetheless, orders came through for him to attend class 64-C, which commenced in August 1964 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The commandant at the time was Chuck Yeager, and Duke&#x27;s twelve-member class included Spence M. Armstrong, Al Worden, Stuart Roosa and Hank Hartsfield. Peter Hoag topped the class; Duke tied for second place. After graduating from ARPS in September 1965, Duke stayed on as an instructor teaching control systems and flying in the F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter, and T-33 Shooting Star aircraft. While he was stationed at Edwards, his first child, Charles Moss Duke III, was born at the base hospital in March 1965.

==NASA==
===Selection and training===

On September 10, 1965, NASA announced that it was recruiting a fifth group of astronauts. Duke spotted a front-page article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and realized that he met all the requirements. He went to see Yeager and the deputy commandant, Colonel Robert Buchanan, who informed him that there were two astronaut selections in progress: one for NASA, and one for the USAF&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. Nominations to NASA had to come through Air Force channels, so it got to pre-screen them. Buchanan told Duke that he could apply for both programs, but if he did, MOL would take him. Duke applied only to NASA, as did Roosa and Worden; Hartsfield applied for both and was taken by MOL.
Duke made the list of 44 finalists selected to undergo medical examinations at Brooks Air Force Base at San Antonio, Texas. He arrived there on January 26, 1966, along with two fellow aviators from Edwards, Joe Engle and Bill Pogue. Psychological tests included Rorschach tests; physical ones included encephalograms, and sessions on treadmills and in a human centrifuge. The eye problem that the Naval Academy had reported was not found.

The final stage of the selection process was an interview by the seven-member selection panel. This was chaired by Deke Slayton, with the other members being astronauts Alan Shepard, John Young, Michael Collins and C.C. Williams, NASA test pilot Warren North, and spacecraft designer Max Faget. These were conducted over a week at the Rice Hotel in Houston. In April 1966, a phone call from Slayton informed Duke that he had been selected. NASA officially announced the names of the 19 men selected on April 4, 1966. Young named the group the &quot;Original Nineteen&quot; in a parody of the original Mercury Seven astronauts.

Duke and his family moved to an apartment in League City, Texas, but when Dotty became pregnant again, they bought a vacant lot in El Lago, Texas, next door to astronaut Bill Anders. They met and befriended a young couple, Glenn and Suzanne House. Glenn was an architect, and he agreed to design them a house for $300. Ground was broken in February 1967, but the house was not completed before a second son, Thomas, was born in May.

Astronaut training included four months of studies covering subjects such as astronomy, orbital mechanics and spacecraft systems. Some 30 hours of briefings were conducted on the Apollo command and service module, and twelve on the Apollo Lunar Module. An important feature was training in geology, so that astronauts on the Moon would know what rocks to look out for. This training in geology included field trips to the Grand Canyon and the Meteor Crater in Arizona, Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, Horse Lava Tube System in Bend, Oregon, and the ash flow in the Marathon Uplift in Texas, and other locations, including Alaska and Hawaii. There was also jungle survival training in Panama, and desert survival training around Reno, Nevada. Water survival training was conducted at Naval Air Station Pensacola using the Dilbert Dunker.

Once their initial training was complete, Duke and Roosa were assigned to oversee the development of the Saturn V launch vehicle, as part of the Booster Branch of the Astronaut Office, headed by Frank Borman and C.C. Williams. He was part of the Mission Control team at the Kennedy Space Center that monitored the launch of Gemini 11 on September 12, 1966, and Gemini 12 on November 11, 1966. His personal responsibility was the Titan II booster. They frequently traveled to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to confer with its director, Wernher von Braun. NASA provided T-38 Talon aircraft for the astronauts&#x27; use, and like most astronauts, Duke flew at every opportunity.

===Lunar Module specialist===

The Nineteen were divided into command and service module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM) specialists. Slayton asked each of them which specialty he preferred, but made the final decision himself. Once again, Duke received his choice, and became a Lunar Module specialist. He oversaw the development of the Lunar Module propulsion systems. A major concern was the ascent propulsion system, which was a critical component of the mission that had to work for the astronauts to survive. Testing at the White Sands Missile Range in 1966 indicated combustion instability. George Low, the Apollo Spacecraft Program manager, convened a committee to review the situation, and Duke became the Astronaut Office representative on it. Although Bell was confident that it could resolve the problems, NASA hired Rocketdyne to develop an alternative engine just in case. The committee ultimately decided to use Rocketdyne&#x27;s injector system with Bell&#x27;s engine.

In 1969, Duke became a member of the support crew for Apollo 10, along with Joe Engle and Jim Irwin. During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them. The mission commander, Tom Stafford, selected Duke for his familiarity with the LM, especially its propulsion systems. For this reason, Duke served as CAPCOM for the LM orbit, activation, checkout, and rendezvous on Apollo 10.

It was unusual for someone to serve as CAPCOM on back-to-back missions, but for the same reason—familiarity with the LM—Neil Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, asked Duke to reprise his role on that mission, which included the first crewed landing on the Moon. Duke told Armstrong that he would be honored to do so. Duke&#x27;s distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world, as the voice of a Mission Control made nervous by a long landing that almost expended all of the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot;″s fuel. Duke&#x27;s first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were flustered, &quot;Roger, Twank...Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We&#x27;re breathing again. Thanks a lot!&quot;

===Apollo 13===
The next rung on the ladder after serving on a support crew was to serve on a backup crew. The pace of the early Apollo missions meant that multiple crews had to be training at the same time. Slayton developed a rotation scheme whereby the backup crew for one mission would become the prime crew for one three missions later, and then the backup for the one three missions after that. If the commander (CDR) declined the offer of another mission, the command module pilot (CMP), as the next most senior astronaut, would become the commander (CDR). Thus, the Apollo 10 crew became the backup crew for Apollo 13. Tom Stafford accepted the position of acting Chief of the Astronaut Office, so the CMP, John Young, stepped up to replace him as CDR; Gene Cernan remained Lunar Module pilot (LMP), and Jack Swigert, a command module specialist from the Nineteen, was designated the CMP. The intention was that this crew would eventually become the prime crew for Apollo 16, but Cernan disagreed with this; he wanted to command his own mission. Slayton therefore assigned Duke, who was well known to Young from Apollo 10, in Cernan&#x27;s place. After Michael Collins, the CMP of Apollo 11, declined the offer of command of the backup crew of Apollo 14, Slayton gave this command to Cernan.

Full-time training for Apollo 13 commenced in July 1969, although the selection of the Apollo 13 and 14 crews was not officially announced until August 7. The prime crew for Apollo 13 consisted of Jim Lovell (CDR), Fred Haise (LMP) and Ken Mattingly (CMP). The mission was originally scheduled to be flown in late 1969, but in view of the successful outcome of Apollo 11, it was postponed until March and then April 1970. Two or three weeks before the launch date, Duke contracted rubella (German measles) from Paul House, the son of Glenn and Suzanne House. The disease is highly contagious, so the NASA doctors checked the prime crew. It was found that Lovell and Haise were immune to the disease, but Mattingly was not. The decision was taken to remove Mattingly and replace him with Swigert.

The subsequent explosion on Apollo 13 greatly affected the backup crew, especially Mattingly, who felt that he should have been on board. Young, Mattingly and Duke worked in the simulators to develop emergency procedures for the crew, who were ultimately returned safely to Earth. Haise and Swigert teased Duke, calling him &quot;Typhoid Mary&quot;. The measles incident resulted in procedures being changed; starting with Apollo 14, the crew would be quarantined for three weeks before the flight as well as afterward. In the event, only the Apollo 14 crew had to endure two periods of quarantine; with no signs of life on the Moon, the post-mission quarantine was discontinued in April 1971.

===Apollo 16===


====Training====
Young, Mattingly and Duke were officially named as the crew of Apollo 16, the fifth lunar landing mission, on March 3, 1971. The Descartes Highlands were chosen as the landing site on June 3, 1971. This was the highest region on the near side of the Moon. It was believed to be volcanic in origin and mainly composed of basalt, based upon the tones of gray observed from Earth. It was hoped that rock samples retrieved by Apollo 16 would provide clues about the processes that formed the highlands, and perhaps even show that such processes were still active.

Training was conducted in the Lunar Module simulator, which used a TV camera and a scale model of the landing area. Other activities included driving a training version of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), and collecting geological samples. A final geological field trip was made to the big island of Hawaii in December 1971. On the second day of the trip, Duke caught the flu. By New Year&#x27;s Day he was so ill that he was unable to get out of bed, and asked the Astronaut Office to send someone to take him to the doctor at the Kennedy Space Center. The doctor took an X-ray that revealed pneumonia in both lungs and called an ambulance to take Duke to the Patrick Air Force Base hospital.

Duke feared that he might not recover in time for the launch, which was scheduled for March 17, 1972. The spacecraft and Saturn V launch vehicle had already been rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on December 13. Luck was with Duke: Grumman engineers wanted more time to test the increased capacity of the LM&#x27;s batteries; a fault was found with the explosive cords that separate the LM from the CSM that warranted their replacement; and a failure of a clamp in Duke&#x27;s spacesuit during training required the modification of all three astronauts&#x27; suits. This caused the launch date to be postponed to the next launch window, on April 16. This proved fortunate when an error by launch pad technicians caused one of the CM&#x27;s Teflon fuel tank bladders to rupture, and the entire space vehicle had to be returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building. Slayton noted that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t even any discussion of replacing him; that was one of the lessons we&#x27;d learned on 13.&quot;

The astronauts went into quarantine and were allowed out only to fly T-38s for an hour a day. The day before liftoff, the Apollo Program director, Rocco Petrone saw someone he believed to be Duke around the pool at the Holiday Inn. A furious Petrone called the crew quarters demanding to know why Duke had broken quarantine. The staff&#x27;s protestations that Duke was still there and had not left did not placate Petrone, and they had to track down Duke in training, who suggested that Petrone might have seen his brother Bill. When Apollo 16 was launched at 12:54 Eastern Standard Time (17:54 UTC) on April 16, 1972, Duke became the first twin to fly in space.

====Outbound voyage====
The launch was normal; the crew experienced vibration similar to that of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V performed flawlessly, and the spacecraft entered low Earth orbit just under 12 minutes after liftoff. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage&#x27;s attitude control system, but these were resolved or compensated for. After 1.5 orbits, it reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at .

In lunar orbit, the crew faced a series of problems. Duke was unable to get the S-band steerable antenna on the LM &quot;Orion&quot; to move in the yaw axis, and therefore could not align it correctly. This resulted in poor communications with the ground stations, and consequently a loss of the computer uplink. This meant that Duke had to copy down 35 five-digit numbers and enter them into the computer. Correcting any mistake was a complicated procedure. Fortunately, the astronauts could still hear Mission Control clearly, although the reverse was not the case.

When Young went to activate the reaction control system, they suffered a double failure on the pressurization system. Young described this as &quot;the worst jam I was ever in&quot;. A long debate between the astronauts and with Mission Control followed. It was the only time during the flight that Duke could recall arguing with Young. Although they could not fix the problem, they were able to work around it by shifting propellant into the ascent storage tank. None was lost; it was just moved into another tank.

With the preparations finished, Young and Duke undocked &quot;Orion&quot; from Mattingly in the CSM &quot;Casper&quot;. Mattingly prepared to shift &quot;Casper&quot; to a circular orbit while Young and Duke prepared &quot;Orion&quot; for the descent to the lunar surface. At this point, during tests of the CSM&#x27;s steerable rocket engine in preparation for the burn to modify the craft&#x27;s orbit, a malfunction occurred in the engine&#x27;s backup system, causing such severe oscillations that &quot;Casper&quot; seemed to be shaking itself to pieces. According to mission rules, &quot;Orion&quot; should have then re-docked with &quot;Casper&quot; in case Mission Control decided to abort the landing and use &quot;Orion&quot;″s engines for the return trip to Earth. This was not done, and the two spacecraft flew on in formation. A decision to land had to be made within five orbits (about ten hours), after which the spacecraft would have drifted too far to reach the landing site.

====Lunar surface====
After four hours and three orbits, Mission Control determined that the malfunction could be worked around and told Young and Duke to proceed with the landing. As a result of the delay, powered descent to the lunar surface began about six hours behind schedule, and Young and Duke began their descent to the surface at an altitude higher than normal. At an altitude of about , Young was able to view the landing site in its entirety. &quot;Orion&quot; landed on the Cayley Plains, northwest of the planned landing site, at 02:23:35 UTC on April 21.

Duke became the tenth person to walk upon the surface of the Moon, following Young, who became the ninth. Apollo 16 was the first scientific expedition to inspect, survey, and sample materials and surface features in the rugged lunar highlands. In a stay of 71 hours and 14 minutes, Duke and Young conducted three excursions onto the lunar surface, during which Duke logged 20 hours and 15 minutes in extravehicular activities. These included the emplacement and activation of scientific equipment and experiments, the collection of nearly of rock and soil samples, and the evaluation and use of the LRV over the roughest surface yet encountered on the Moon.

During their final few minutes on the surface, Duke attempted to set a lunar high jump record. He jumped about , but overbalanced, and fell over backwards on his primary life support system (PLSS). It could have been a fatal accident; had his suit ruptured or PLSS broken, he might have died. &quot;That ain&#x27;t very smart&quot;, Young noted.

====Return to Earth====

On the way back to Earth, Duke assisted in a deep-space EVA that lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes, when Mattingly climbed out of the &quot;Casper&quot; spacecraft and retrieved film cassettes from the service module. After a journey during which &quot;Casper&quot; had traveled , the Apollo 16 mission concluded with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 19:45:05 UTC on April 27, and recovery by the aircraft carrier .

Duke left two items on the Moon, both of which he photographed. The most famous is a plastic-encased photo portrait of his family taken by NASA photographer Ludy Benjamin. The reverse of the photo was signed and thumb printed by Duke&#x27;s family and bore this message: &quot;This is the family of Astronaut Duke from Planet Earth, who landed on the Moon on the twentieth of April 1972.&quot;

The other item was a commemorative medal issued by the Air Force, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1972. Duke was the only Air Force officer to visit the Moon that year. With the approval of the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General John D. Ryan, and the Secretary of the Air Force, Robert Seamans, Duke took two silver medallions commemorating the anniversary. He left one on the Moon and donated the other to the Air Force. Today it is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, along with a Moon rock from the Apollo 16 mission.

In the wake of the Apollo 15 postal covers scandal, Slayton replaced the Apollo 15 crew as the backup for the Apollo 17 mission with the Apollo 16 one. Duke became the backup LMP, Young the backup commander, and Roosa the backup CMP. They went into training again in June 1972, just two months after Duke and Young had returned from the Moon. There was only a slim chance that they would be called upon to fly the mission, and in the event were not. Duke never flew in space again. He retired from NASA on January 1, 1976. He had spent 265 hours and 51 minutes in space.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from NASA, Duke left active duty in the USAF as a colonel, and entered the Air Force Reserve. He served as Mobilization Augmentee to the Commander, Air Force Basic Military Training Center and to the Commander, USAF Recruiting Service. He graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1978 and was promoted to brigadier general the following year. He retired in June 1986. He has logged 4,147 hours of flying time, of which 3,632 hours was in jet aircraft.

Duke had always been fond of Coors Beer, which was only available in Texas around Dallas and El Paso at the time. In 1975, he heard that the company was thinking of expanding into the rest of Texas. He formed a partnership with former Olympic basketball player Dick Boushka, and they drew up a business plan and put in a bid for the new Coors distributorship in Austin. Coors declined their bid, but offered the distributorship in San Antonio instead, which they accepted. The house in El Lago was sold, and Duke and his family moved to New Braunfels, a community not far from San Antonio, where, , he and wife Dotty remain. His brother Bill died in 2011.

The Coors distributorship was very successful, but Duke became bored and frustrated with it, and decided to sell in February 1978. He and Boushka realized a handsome profit from what had become a thriving business. He joined a friend, Ken Campbell, in real estate ventures. His subsequent business ventures include being president of the Orbit Corporation from 1976 to 1978; director of the Robbins Company from 1986 to 1989 and Amherst Fiber Optics in 2000; chairman of Duke Resources from 1988 to 1993 and Texcor from 1989 to 1994, and of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation from 2011 to 2012. He was also a consultant for Lockheed Martin.

In 1978, Duke became a committed born-again Christian. Duke wrote in his autobiography that his temper, ego, single-minded devotion to work, and greed had ruined his relationship with his wife and his children, and that his marriage teetered on the verge of divorce in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with Dotty suffering from depression and having considered suicide at one point. Duke stated that his marriage and his relationship with his children improved considerably after he committed his life to Jesus, and both Duke and Dotty—who became a Christian before him—credit God with making their lives much more complete and joyful, with Duke being active in Christian ministry. The Dukes are members of Christ Our King Anglican Church, an Anglican Church in North America congregation in New Braunfels.
==Awards and honors==

In 1973, Duke received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of South Carolina, an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Francis Marion University in 1990, and an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Clemson University in 2012. Other honors include the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1972, Manned Spacecraft Center Certificate of Commendation in 1970, the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with Oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit, Society of Experimental Test Pilots&#x27; Iven C. Kincheloe Award in 1972, American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award for 1972, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics&#x27; Haley Astronautics Award for 1973, Fédération Aéronautique Internationale V. M. Komarov Diploma in 1973, and the Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1975. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach presented the Sky is the Limit Trophy to Duke in 2018.

Duke was named South Carolina Man of the Year in 1973, inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame in 1973, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. He was inducted into the Texas Science Hall of Fame in 2000, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2019. His name is inscribed on The Astronaut Monument in Iceland, where they conducted some of their geological training. In December 2019, he was named Texan of the Year for 2020. Asteroid 26382 Charlieduke was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on May 18, 2019.

==Cultural depictions==
Duke was the subject of the documentary &quot;Lunar Tribute&quot;, which premiered at the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Hayden Planetarium on October 20, 2017. At a panel after the screening, Neil deGrasse Tyson noted that Duke was the youngest person to walk on the Moon. Duke responded that at age 82, he still was. He joined the Back to Space organization in 2018 as an Astronaut Consultant with the goal of inspiring through film the next generation to go to Mars. He was featured prominently in the BBC World Service Podcast, &quot;13 Minutes to the Moon&quot;, released in 2019 to mark 50 years since the Apollo 11 mission.

In 2018, country music duo The Stryker Brothers released the song &quot;Charlie Duke Took Country Music To The Moon&quot;, which tells the true story of how Duke brought two audio cassette tapes of country music to play during the Apollo 16 mission. Duke&#x27;s friend Bill Bailey, a disc jockey at Houston-area country music radio station KIKK, had enlisted several country stars of the time to provide personalized recordings for the astronauts. The tapes were introduced by Merle Haggard, and other artists included Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton, Buck Owens, Jerry Reed, Chet Atkins, and Floyd Cramer.

&quot;The Stryker Brothers&quot; was the stage name for a collaboration between Robert Earl Keen and Randy Rogers, but the two initially kept their identities secret, with promotional material claiming that the music originated from two actual brothers who had died in a prison fire. Duke appeared in an online video asserting that he got to know the brothers as children at the home of disc jockey Bailey, and that he gave them a copy of the tapes following his return from the Moon. In reality, Duke met Rogers at an event in New Braunfels, where both men live.

Duke is a character in episode 34 of the fictional youth audio adventure series Jonathan Park. The script was based on an interview conducted with Duke by the series production team.

In the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Duke was played by J. Downing.

In the 2019 alternate history web television series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, he is played by Ben Begley.

<doc id="328016" wikidata="Q267894" url="?curid=328016" title="Wakkanai">
<text>is a city located in Sōya Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. Wakkanai is the capital of Sōya Subprefecture. Situated approximately 1,100 km north of Tokyo and 270 km north of Sapporo, it is the northernmost municipality under Japanese administration following the loss of Karafuto (present-day Sakhalin) and the Kuril Islands, with Benten-jima being the northernmost point under Japanese control.

Wakkanai started as the Matsumae Domain&#x27;s trading post with the Ainu people in 1685. Edo-period explorer Mamiya Rinzō set sail for his famous Karafuto expedition from the settlement. After Japan regained Karafuto following its victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Wakkanai rose to prominence as a gateway to this reclaimed territory. Two railway lines, the Tempoku and Sōya lines, extended to Wakkanai, and the Chihaku ferry carried passengers further north to Ōdomari in Karafuto. This improved transport network enabled the commercial digging of local coal mines, which had remained untouched due to their remote location.

After the Second World War, Wakkanai lost its status as the gateway to Japan&#x27;s northern frontier. All coal mines in the area were closed by the 1970s, and Wakkanai&#x27;s primary industries shifted to fishing, dairy farming, and tourism. The city&#x27;s population peaked at 55,464 in 1975. The Tempoku Line, which connected Wakkanai to Otoineppu via the coastal town of Hamatonbetsu, was discontinued in 1989. In 1995, the ferry route between Wakkanai and Sakhalin was reestablished for the first time since 1945 but ceased operations in 2015 due to low demand. Today, ferry routes connect the city to the islands of Rishiri and Rebun.

, the city had an estimated population of 30,590 in 17150 households, and a population density of 40 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

== Toponomy ==
The name Wakkanai originates from &quot;&#x27;yam-wakka-nay&quot;&#x27; in the Ainu language, meaning &#x27;a stream of cold drinking water&#x27;. It is said to refer to a stream that once flowed between the present-day Wakkanai Station and Minami Wakkanai Station.

==History==

Wakkanai was originally home to an Ainu population. A Japanese settlement was established in 1685 by Matsumae Domain as a trading post and key point for guarding northern Japan and the exploration of Sakhalin. The settlement came under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate from 1807 to 1821, and again from 1859, when Akita Domain was assigned to provide a garrison. The Akita garrison was replaced by Kanazawa Domain in 1870. After the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), which exchanged Japanese claims on Sakhalin with the Kuril Islands, 841 Japanese settlers in Sakhalin were relocated to Wakkanai. A county office and headman&#x27;s office established in Soya in 1879, which is regarded as the official foundation of the village of Wakkanai. In 1897, Sōya Subprefecture was established and Wakkanai was elevated to town status in 1901. 

During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy used the harbor and port as a submarine base. Wakkanai was far enough north to be outside the range of American bombers and was safe from air attacks. Until the early to mid-1960s, the northern portion of the harbor remained divided by concrete sub-mooring pens. The large breakwater structure (which still exists) was actually a sub-repair facility. At the shore end there was a huge winching mechanism capable of hauling subs up into the partially enclosed structure where they could be repaired while completely out of the water. Built into the hills above the city there were several reinforced concrete bunker-type caves where (anecdotally) they were used either to store ammunition and armament, or as air raid shelters for the civilian populace. History would suggest the former use, rather than the latter. During a re-build/renovation of the harbor sometime during the 1960s or 1970s, the harbor was cleared of the concrete pens and the machinery was removed from the breakwater structure which was reconfigured.

Wakkanai was elevated to city status in 1949. In 1955, Wakkanai annexed neighboring Soya village.

==Geography==
Wakkanai is at the northern tip of Hokkaido, and faces the Sea of Japan to the west, Sōya Bay and the Sōya Strait to the north, and the Sea of Okhotsk to the east. Japan&#x27;s northernmost point, Cape Sōya, is located in Wakkanai, which is on a peninsula jutting towards Sakhalin Island in Russia, which is 43 kilometers (27 miles) away. The city has a length of approximately 39 kilometers from north-to-south and 38 kilometers from east-to-west. The northernmost point is Benten-jima (45°31′35″N, 141°55′09″E), located northwest of Cape Sōya. This is the northernmost point of the land area currently under the effective control of Japan. The topography of the city consists of two hilly mountain ranges running north-to-south, and lowlands in between and at both ends of these. The eastern mountain range is called the &quot;Sōya Hills&quot; and is a periglacial landform that has been selected as a &quot;Hokkaido Heritage Site&quot;. The lowlands between the western hills and the Sea of Japan are sand dunes and wetlands, and are part of the Rishiri-Rebun-Sarobetsu National Park.

==Climate==
Wakkanai has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) typical of Hokkaido but with strong influence of the ocean as island portions near the great land masses (such as the smaller islands of Nova Scotia), with cold winters, warm summers and generally heavy precipitation from the Aleutian Low, whose winds hit the city direct from the Sea of Japan but with strong oceanic influence (46 °F). The winter is cold enough not to fall in a maritime climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) and the summers although very mild for typical climate is warm enough not to fall into a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), both in the classification of Koppen. The mean annual temperature, at , is the second lowest for a significant population centre in Japan after Nemuro. Snowfall at , the third highest for a big city in Japan after Asahikawa and Aomori and one of the highest anywhere in the world. For comparison, Nain in Canada receives of snow.

The Aleutian Low also makes the sunshine hours the lowest of Japan&#x27;s major population centres and in the winter the wind speeds are the highest in Japan with an average of , which adds to the cold of a typical winter day.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Wakkanai was on 29 July 2021. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 30 January 1944.
===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Wakkanai is as shown below.
As of today, most of Wakkanai&#x27;s residents are ethnic Japanese and can speak Japanese. However, smaller fractions of them tend to have Russian ancestry, due to the proximity between Wakkanai and Russia, who can speak Russian depending on how well Russian is taught in different households. Additionally, in even smaller numbers, there are also Ainu people or individuals of partial Ainu ancestry living in Wakkanai (see History above). 

==Government==
Wakkanai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Wakkanai contributes one member to the Hokkaido Legislative Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Hokkaido 12th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Wakkanai city&#x27;s core industries are fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. As the largest city north of Asahikawa, it is home to regional branches of national institutions such as the Japan Coast Guard, the Self-Defense Forces, the local tax office, the courts, and the district prosecutor&#x27;s office, as well as the Soya General Bureau. Tourism is facilitated in the local area via fisheries and monuments, as well as with ferries to the nearby offshore islands (see Seaports below). There are multiple fishing ports which specialize in deep sea fishing and marine products. Marine products are sold in the Kita Market and Fukko market located in the city. 

==Education==
Wakkanai has nine public elementary schools, five public junior high schools and one combined elementary/junior high school operated by the city government and one public high school (Hokkaido Wakkanai High School) operated by the Hokkaido Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The Hokkaido government also operates one special education school, the Hokkaido Wakkanai Special Needs School.

Ikueikan University, formerly known as Wakkanai Hokusei Gakuen University, is located in the city.

<text>Vesna Pisarović (born 9 April 1978) is a Croatian pop and jazz singer. 

==Life and career==
===1978–1999: Early life===
Pisarović was born in Brčko, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia and grew up in Požega, Croatia. From her earliest childhood she attended a music school, where she played the flute, sang in choirs and participated in various music contests.

In the mid-1990s she moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where she graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. She began singing in clubs and writing songs. In 1997, while performing at the Croatian festival Zadarfest, she met Milana Vlaović, a journalist and composer. Vlaović later started to write songs for Pisarović.

===2000–2002: Breakthrough and the Eurovision Song Contest===
In 2002 Vesna Pisarović won the annual Dora festival, the event that determines Croatia&#x27;s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. Her song &quot;Everything I Want&quot; placed 11th in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. She wrote the song &quot;In the Disco&quot; for the Bosnian vocalist Deen, which represented Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Eurovision Song Contest 2004.

===2016–2019: &quot;Naša velika pjesmarica&quot; and &quot;Petit Standard&quot;===
Pisarović&#x27;s eighth studio and third jazz album, &quot;Petit Standard&quot;, was released in March 2019 through the German jazz label Jazzwerkstatt. She embarked on her Petit Standard Tour later in July.

===2020–present: Upcoming ninth studio album===
On 5 October 2019 in an interview with Narodni radio Pisarović revealed that she has been working on her upcoming pop album since 2006.
Since then she has written over 30 songs. The recording process for the album started in early 2020. On 13 February 2021, Pisarović performed a medley during the show program at Dora 2021. In August 2021 in an interview with Slobodna Dalmacija, Pisarović revealed how she has &quot;two thousand music sheets of new music&quot; that she has written in the past few years. She also noted how the album is in the works but not yet ready to be announced. Pisarović&#x27;s major comeback concert with her mainstream repertoire was supposed to be held in 2020 but was rescheduled multiple times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2022 the concert was confirmed to be held at the Dom Sportova in Zagreb on 29 April 2022. In May 2022, Pisarović released a remixed version of &quot;Neka ljudi govore&quot; with newly recorded vocals. In June 2024, Pisarović announced that the lead single from her upcoming ninth studio album will be released on 1 September 2024. A month later, in July 2024, Bravo! announced her headlining concert at the Arena Zagreb on 26 April 2025.

<text>Equisetaceae, also known as the horsetail family, is a family of ferns and the only surviving family of the order Equisetales, with one surviving genus, &quot;Equisetum&quot;, comprising about twenty species.

== Evolution and systematics ==
Equisetaceae is the only surviving family of the Equisetales, a group with many fossils of large tree-like plants that possessed ribbed stems similar to modern horsetails. &quot;Pseudobornia&quot; is the oldest known relative of &quot;Equisetum&quot;; it grew in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago and is assigned to its own order.

All living horsetails are placed in the genus &quot;Equisetum&quot;. But there are some fossil species that are not assignable to the modern genus. &quot;Equisetites&quot; is a &quot;wastebin taxon&quot; uniting all sorts of large horsetails from the Mesozoic; it is almost certainly paraphyletic and would probably warrant being subsumed in &quot;Equisetum&quot;. But while some of the species placed there are likely to be ancestral to the modern horsetails, there have been reports of secondary growth in other &quot;Equisetites&quot;, and these probably represent a distinct and now-extinct horsetail lineage. &quot;Equicalastrobus&quot; is the name given to fossil horsetail strobili, which probably mostly or completely belong to the (sterile) plants placed in &quot;Equisetites&quot;.

The earliest fossils that can be reliabily attributed to the Equisetaceae proper date to the Triassic.

<text>Seagate Technology Holdings plc is an American data storage company. It was incorporated in 1978 as Shugart Technology and commenced business in 1979. Since 2010, the company has been incorporated in Dublin, Ireland, with operational headquarters in Fremont, California, United States.

Seagate developed the first 5.25-inch hard disk drive (HDD), the 5-megabyte ST-506, in 1980. They were a major supplier in the microcomputer market during the 1980s, especially after the introduction of the IBM XT in 1983. Much of their growth has come through their acquisition of competitors. In 1989, Seagate acquired Control Data Corporation&#x27;s Imprimis division, the makers of CDC&#x27;s HDD products. Seagate acquired Conner Peripherals in 1996, Maxtor in 2006, and Samsung&#x27;s HDD business in 2011. Today, Seagate, along with its competitor Western Digital, dominates the HDD market.

== History ==

=== Founding as Shugart Technology ===
Seagate Technology (then called Shugart Technology) was incorporated on November 1, 1978, and commenced operations with co-founders Al Shugart, Tom Mitchell, Doug Mahon, Finis Conner, and Syed Iftikar in October 1979. The company came into being when Conner approached Shugart with the idea of starting a new company to develop 5.25-inch HDDs which Conner predicted would be a coming economic boom in the disk drive market. The name was changed to Seagate Technology to avoid a lawsuit from Xerox&#x27;s subsidiary Shugart Associates (also founded by Shugart).

=== Early history and Tom Mitchell era ===
The company&#x27;s first product, the ST-506, with a storage capacity of 5 megabytes (MB), was released in 1980. It was the first hard disk to fit the 5.25-inch form factor of the Shugart mini-floppy drive. It used a Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM) encoding and was later released in a 10 MB version, the ST-412. With this, Seagate secured a contract as a major OEM supplier for the IBM XT, IBM&#x27;s first personal computer to contain a hard disk. The large volumes of units sold to IBM fueled Seagate&#x27;s early growth. In their first year, Seagate shipped $10 million worth of units to consumers. By 1983, the company shipped over 200,000 units for revenues of $110 million.

In 1983, Al Shugart was replaced as president by then chief operating officer, Tom Mitchell, in order to move forward with corporate restructuring in the face of a changing market. Shugart continued to oversee corporate planning. By this point, the company had a 45% market share of the single-user hard drive market, with IBM purchasing 60% of the total business Seagate was doing at the time.

In 1989, Seagate acquired Imprimis Technology, the disk storage division of Control Data Corporation, resulting in a combined market share of 43%. Seagate benefited from Imprimis&#x27; head technology and reputation while Imprimis gained access to Seagate&#x27;s lower component and manufacturing costs.

=== Second Al Shugart era (1990s) ===
In September 1991, Tom Mitchell resigned as president under pressure from the board of directors, with Al Shugart reassuming presidency of the company. Shugart refocused the company on its more lucrative markets, and on mainframe drives instead of external drives. He also pulled away from outsourcing component production overseas. This allowed Seagate to better keep up with demand for PCs, which increased extremely rapidly in 1993 across the market. This included a domestic partnership with Corning Inc., which began using a new glass-ceramic compound to manufacture disk substrates. In 1991, Seagate also introduced the Barracuda HDD, the industry&#x27;s first hard disk with a 7,200 RPM spindle speed.

In May 1993, Seagate became the first company to cumulatively ship 50 million HDDs over its firm&#x27;s history. The following year, Seagate Technology Inc moved from the Nasdaq stock exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker symbol SEG. Upon leaving, the company was the 17th-largest company in terms of trading volume on the Nasdaq exchange. In 1996, Seagate merged with Conner Peripherals to form the world&#x27;s largest independent hard-drive manufacturer. Following the merger, the company began a system of consolidating the components and production methods within its production chain of factories in order to streamline how products were built between plants.

In May 1995, Seagate Technology acquired Frye Computer Systems, a software company based in Boston, Massachusetts. This company developed the LAN monitoring software kit &quot;The Frye Utilities for Networks&quot;, which won PC Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; award in 1995.

In 1996, Seagate introduced the industry&#x27;s first hard disk with a 10,000 RPM spindle speed, the Cheetah 4LP. By 2000, this product increased to a speed of 15,000 RPM with the release of the Cheetah 15X. In May 1997, the High Court of Justice in England awarded Amstrad PLC $93 million in a lawsuit over reportedly faulty disk drives Seagate sold to Amstrad, a British manufacturer and marketer of personal computers. That year, Seagate also introduced the first Fibre Channel interface hard drive.

In 1997, Seagate experienced a downturn, along with the rest of the industry. In July 1998, Shugart resigned his positions with the company. Stephen J. &quot;Steve&quot; Luczo became the new chief executive officer, also joining the board of directors.

=== First Steve Luczo era (1998–2004) ===
Luczo joined Seagate Technology in October 1993 as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In March 1995, he was appointed Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and chief operating officer of Seagate Software Holdings. In 1996, Luczo led the Seagate acquisition of Conner Peripherals, creating the world&#x27;s largest disk drive manufacturer and completing the company&#x27;s strategy of vertical integration and ownership of key disk drive components. In September 1997, he was promoted to the positions of President and Chief Operating Officer.

In 1998, the board appointed Luczo as the new CEO and Seagate launched a restructuring effort. Historically, Seagate&#x27;s design centers had been organized around function, with one product line manager in charge of tracking the progress of all programs. In 1998, Luczo and CTO Tom Porter called for an organizational redesign of design centers into core teams focused on individual projects, in order to meet the corporate objective of faster time to market. As the CEO, Luczo decided to increase investment in technology and to diversify into faster-growing, higher-margin businesses. He decided to implement a highly automated platform strategy for manufacturing. Between 1997 and 2004, Seagate reduced its headcount from approximately 111,000 to approximately 50,000, reduced its manufacturing factories from 24 to 11, and reduced design centers from seven to three. During this period, Seagate&#x27;s output increased from approximately 9 million drives per quarter to approximately 20 million drives per quarter.

In 1998, the company&#x27;s Seagate Research facility was also established in Pittsburgh, a $30 million investment that focused on future technologies and prototypes. Technology developed by the facility would include devices like the hard drive disk for Microsoft&#x27;s first Xbox.

In 1999, Seagate shipped its 250 millionth hard drive.

In May 1999, Seagate sold its Network &amp; Storage Management Group (NSMG) to Veritas Software in return for 155 million shares of Veritas&#x27; stock. With this deal, Seagate became the largest shareholder in Veritas, with an ownership stake of more than 40%.

=== Re-privatization (2000) ===
In 2000, Seagate became a private company again. Luczo led a management buyout of Seagate, believing that Seagate needed to make significant capital investments to achieve its goals. He decided to turn the company private, since disk drive producers had a hard time obtaining capital for long-term projects. The company was incorporated in Grand Cayman and stayed private until it re-entered the public market in 2002.

In early November 1999, Luczo met with representatives of Silver Lake Partners to discuss a major restructuring of Seagate. After two failed attempts to increase Seagate&#x27;s stock price and unlock its value from Veritas, Seagate&#x27;s board of directors authorized Luczo to seek advice from Morgan Stanley in October 1999. In early November 1999, Morgan Stanley arranged a meeting between Seagate executives and representatives of Silver Lake Partners. On November 22, 2000, Seagate management, Veritas Software, and an investor group led by Silver Lake closed a complex deal that privatized Seagate. At the time, this was the largest buyout ever of a technology company. The total deal, worth about $20 billion, included the sale of its disk-drive operations for $2 billion to an investor group led by Silver Lake Partners. The goal of the deal was to unlock the value of the 33% ownership stake Seagate had in Veritas, which had put the value of Seagate&#x27;s stock at around $33 billion even though its market cap was only $15 billion.

Following the relocation to the Cayman Islands in 2000, the legal name of a holding company was simplified to Seagate Technology. The &quot;de facto&quot; operational company, incorporated in Delaware, became a limited liability company (LLC) named Seagate Technology LLC and operates to this day as such.

Both the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Harvard Business School have written multiple case studies on the Seagate buyout and turnaround. In addition, several leading management books cite the Seagate turnaround.

=== Re-emerging as a public company (2002–2010) ===
Luczo became the chairman of the board of directors of Seagate Technology on June 19, 2002. In 2003, he accepted an invitation from the New York Stock Exchange to join its Listed Companies Advisory Committee.

In 2003, Seagate re-entered the HDD market for notebook computers and provided the 1-inch hard drives for the first iPods. This led to a trend of digital devices being created with progressively more and more memory, especially in cameras and music devices. In September 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Seagate &quot;the nation&#x27;s top maker of hard drives used to store data in computers&quot;, following the company forecasting its quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates.

In 2004, the company separated the roles of chairman and CEO. Luczo resigned as the Seagate CEO on July 3, but retained his position as chairman of the board of directors. Bill Watkins became CEO.

At the beginning of 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named Seagate its Company of the Year as the best managed company in the United States. &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote that, &quot;Seagate is riding the world&#x27;s gadget boom. Its 1-inch drives are the archives for cameras and MP3 players.&quot; It also credited Seagate as being the company that &quot;sparked the personal computer revolution 25 years ago with the first 5.25-inch hard drive for the PC&quot;.

In April 2006, Seagate announced the first professional Direct-To-Disc digital cinema professional video camera aimed at the independent filmmaking market. This technology used Seagate&#x27;s HDDs.

In 2007, Seagate created the hybrid drive concept.

In 2007, Seagate announced the &quot;phase out&quot; of parallel ATA hard disk drives by early 2008.

In April 2008, Seagate was the first to ship one billion HDDs. According to &quot;CNET&quot;, it took 17 years to ship the first 100 million and 15 years to ship the next 900 million. In 2009, Bill Watkins was released from employment as CEO.

On August 27, 2008, Seagate&#x27;s stock listing was transferred to the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap), trading under the same ticker symbol, STX.

=== Second Steve Luczo era (2009–2017) ===
In January 2009, Luczo was asked by the Seagate Board to return as CEO of the company, replacing Bill Watkins. As of the date of his hiring, Seagate was losing market share, facing rapidly declining revenues, was lagging in product delivery with high manufacturing costs, had an excessive operating expense structure, and had $2 billion of debt that was due within 2 years. The company&#x27;s market value was less than $1.5 billion.

Luczo revamped the entire management team, and quickly reorganized the company back to a functional structure after a failed attempt to organize by business units in 2007. Led by a new Head of Sales (Dave Mosley), a new head of Operations and Development (Bob Whitmore), and a new CFO (Pat O&#x27;Malley), the team worked to address the multitude of challenges that it faced. By the end of 2009, the company had refinanced its debt and had begun to turn around its operations. In 2010, Seagate reinstated its dividend and began a stock buyback plan.

In 2010, Seagate announced that it was moving its headquarters and most of its staff from Scotts Valley to Cupertino, California.

In June 2010, Seagate released the world&#x27;s first 3 TB hard drive. That September, Seagate released the first portable 1.5 TB hard drive.

In July 2011, the company changed its country of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Ireland. Since then, the holding company became a public limited company (PLC) named Seagate Technology plc.

In December 2011, Seagate acquired Samsung&#x27;s HDD business. Seagate also acquired a license to use Samsung trademark on HDD products for 5 years; after license expired, Seagate rebranded all Samsung-branded external HDD products to Maxtor, a company that Seagate acquired at the end of 2005. After the acquisition, internal HDDs from former Samsung factories were simultaneously branded as Samsung and Seagate, and then were exclusively branded as Seagate.

In 2012, Seagate continued to raise its dividend and repurchased nearly 30% of the company&#x27;s outstanding shares. In the fiscal year ending June 2012, Seagate had achieved record revenues, record gross margins, record profits, and regained its position as the largest disc drive manufacturer. Its market value had increased to over $14 billion. In March 2012, Seagate demonstrated the first 1 TB/square inch density hard drive, with the possibility of scaling up to 60 TB by 2030.

In 2013, Seagate was the first HDD company to begin shipment of shingled magnetic recording drives, announcing in September that they had already shipped over 1 million such drives.

In February 2016, Seagate received a class action lawsuit concerning defective hard drives.

In August 2016, Seagate demonstrated its 60 TB SSD—claimed to be &quot;the largest SSD ever demonstrated&quot;—at the Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara.

In January 2017, Seagate announced the shutdown of one of its largest HDD assembly plants, located in Suzhou, China. The plant became part of Seagate after Maxtor&#x27;s acquisition in 2006; Maxtor started producing hard drives in Suzhou in 2004.

=== Dave Mosley era (2017–present) ===
On July 25, 2017, David &quot;Dave&quot; Mosley was appointed CEO, effective from October 1, 2017 after longtime CEO, Steve Luczo stepped down and became executive chairman.

In June 2018, Seagate was honored at the 14th Annual Manufacturing Leadership Awards Gala in Huntington Beach, California. In 2018, Seagate invested in Series A and B of Ripple, an enterprise blockchain company.

In 2019, Seagate invested £47 million in a research and development project at its factory in Derry, Northern Ireland.

In 2020, Seagate announced that it was moving its headquarters and most of its staff from Cupertino to Fremont, California. From May to June that year, the company laid off 500 employees across 12 countries due to a push for better operational efficiencies. Seagate planned for the rearrangement of more resources, including combining facilities in Minnesota.

In September 2020, Seagate announced it had entered the object storage business and introduced CORTX, an open-source object storage software, Lyve Rack, a reference architecture based on CORTX, and a corresponding developer community. The community is a group of open-source researchers and developers working to advance mass-capacity object storage. CORTX open-source software is hosted for download and collaboration on GitHub.

As of May 18, 2021, the new Irish public limited company Seagate Technology Holdings plc became the publicly traded parent company of Seagate, replacing &quot;Seagate Technology plc.&quot;

In November 2021, at the Open Compute Summit, Seagate demonstrated the industry&#x27;s first HDD with a non-volatile memory express (NVMe) interface. This was unusual because HDDs operate far below the capabilities of the NVMe interface, which is usually associated with faster storage media like SSDs.

In May 2022, Seagate presented and demonstrated their LiDAR system at the Autosens conference in Detroit. In February 2023, it divested its LiDAR division to Luminar Technologies.

In October 2022, Seagate announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount by 8%, equivalent to approximately 3,000 jobs.

On January 17, 2024, Seagate announced the release of the first 30 TB HDD with the Exos Mozaic 3+ HDD series. The series utilizes Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) and Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology with an areal density of 3 TB per platter. The 30 TB Mozaic 3+ drive uses ten platters, only one more than the 16 TB Exos X16. Seagate plans to ramp capacity of their HAMR drives, eventually reaching an areal density of 5 TB per platter by 2028. Seagate claims the new drives will have a cheaper cost per TB compared to existing drive models. The series is initially only available to enterprise markets, but is expected to be available to end users by mid 2025.

In February 2025, Seagate announced it would acquire HDD equipment maker Intevac for $119 million in an all-cash deal.

== Corporate affairs ==
Seagate was initially traded as a public company on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol SGAT. In 1994, it moved to the New York Stock Exchange as SEG. In 2000, Seagate incorporated in the Cayman Islands in order to reduce income taxes. In 2000, the company was taken private by an investment group composed of Seagate management, Silver Lake Partners, Texas Pacific Group, and others in a three-way merger-spinoff with Veritas Software; Veritas merged with Seagate, which was bought by the investment group. Veritas was then immediately spun off to shareholders, gaining rights to Seagate Software Network and Storage Management Group (with products such as Backup Exec), as well as Seagate&#x27;s shares in SanDisk and Dragon Systems. Seagate Software Information Management Group was renamed Crystal Decisions in May 2001. In December 2002, Seagate re-entered the public market on the Nasdaq as STX.

By November 2023, 89% of the stock was controlled by institutional investors, with a controlling stake of 52% held by 8 investors. The largest stakes held by hedge funds Vanguard Group, Inc, Sanders Capital, LLC and BlackRock, Inc. account for 11%, 7.2%, 7.2% of shares outstanding respectively.

== Partnerships and acquisitions ==
Finis Conner left Seagate in early 1985 and founded Conner Peripherals, which originally specialized in small-form-factor drives for portable computers. Conner Peripherals also entered the tape drive business with its purchase of Archive Corporation. After ten years as an independent company, Conner Peripherals was acquired by Seagate in a 1996 merger.

In 2005, Seagate acquired Mirra Inc., a producer of personal servers for data recovery. It also acquired ActionFront Data Recovery Labs, which provides data recovery services.

In 2006, Seagate acquired Maxtor in an all-stock deal worth $1.9 billion, and afterwards continued to market the separate Maxtor brand. The following year, Seagate acquired EVault and MetaLINCS, later rebranded as i365.

In 2014, Seagate acquired Xyratex, a storage systems company, for approximately $375 million. The same year, it acquired LSI&#x27;s flash enterprise PCIe flash and SSD controller products, and its engineering capabilities, from Avago for $450 million.

In October 2015, Seagate acquired Dot Hill Systems, a supplier of software and hardware storage systems, for approximately $696 million.

== Controversies ==

In 2015, Seagate&#x27;s NAS drives—a type of wireless storage device—was found to have an undocumented hardcoded password.

On January 21, 2014, numerous tech articles around the globe published findings from the cloud storage provider Backblaze that Seagate hard disks are least reliable among prominent hard disk manufacturers. However, the Backblaze tests have been criticized for having a flawed methodology that has inconsistent environment variables, such as ambient temperatures, vibration, and disk usage. In addition, Backblaze&#x27;s statistics show that the vast majority of their installed drives are manufactured by Seagate, and Backblaze editor Andy Klein has noted &quot;that a large number of new Seagate drives being deployed could be statistically responsible&quot; for failure rate data in their specific datacenter population. In the broader landscape, Seagate enterprise drives were named &quot;most reliable&quot; for seven years running in the IT Brand Pulse survey of top IT professionals, and cited as the leader for the previous two years in every measured category: reliability, performance, innovation, price, and service and support. In 2019, Backblaze released updated statistics which reported that Seagate drives had the most failures in Q2 2019, whereas its best-rated drives were made by Toshiba.

In October 2021, a report by U.S. Senate Republicans claimed that Seagate violated Export Administration Regulations by selling parts and components to Huawei following U.S. sanctions against the Chinese telecommunications company. The company received another letter in August 2022 from the U.S. Commerce Department&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) for allegedly violating export sanctions to sell Huawei hard drives. Seagate denied any violations claiming that its foreign-made hard drives are not subject to the restriction since the disks and the equipment to make them were not a direct product of any American semiconductor technology or software. In April 2023, Seagate reached a settlement agreement with the Department agreeing to pay $300millionthe largest civil penalty imposed by the BISfor selling over 7.4 million hard drives to Huawei without BIS authorization. The resolution also included three stages of audits focusing on its export controls compliance program and a suspended denial order.

<text>Winchester rifle is a comprehensive term describing a series of lever action repeating rifles manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Developed from the 1860 Henry rifle, Winchester rifles were among the earliest repeaters. The Model 1873 was particularly successful, being marketed by the manufacturer as &quot;The Gun That Won the West&quot;.

==Predecessors==

In 1848, Walter Hunt of New York patented his &quot;Volition Repeating Rifle&quot; incorporating a tubular magazine, which was operated by two levers and complex linkages. The Hunt rifle fired what he called the &quot;Rocket Ball&quot;, an early form of caseless ammunition in which the powder charge was contained in the bullet&#x27;s hollow base. Hunt&#x27;s design was fragile and unworkable, but in 1849, Lewis Jennings purchased the Hunt patents and developed a functioning, if still complex rifle. This version was produced in small numbers by Robbins &amp; Lawrence of Windsor, Vermont until 1852.

Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson of Norwich, Connecticut, acquired the Jennings patent from Robbins &amp; Lawrence, as well as shop foreman Benjamin Tyler Henry. Smith made several improvements to the Jennings design, and in 1855 Smith and Wesson together with several investors formed a corporation, the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company, to manufacture Smith&#x27;s modification of the Hunt-Jennings, the Volcanic lever-action pistol and rifle. Its largest stockholder was Oliver Winchester.

For the Volcanic rifle, Smith added a primer charge to Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Ball&quot; and thus created one of the first fixed metallic cartridges which incorporated bullet, primer and powder in one self-contained unit. While still with the company, Smith went a step further and added a cylindrical copper case to hold the bullet and powder with the primer in the case rim, thus creating one of the most significant inventions in firearms history: the metallic rimfire cartridge. Smith&#x27;s cartridge, the .22 Short, would be introduced commercially in 1857 with the landmark Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1 revolver and is still manufactured today.

The Volcanic rifle had only limited success, which was partially attributable to the design and poor performance of the Hunt-derived Volcanic cartridge, a hollow conical ball filled with black powder and sealed by a cork primer. Although the Volcanic&#x27;s repeater design far outpaced the rival technology, the unsatisfactory power and reliability of the .25 and .32 caliber &quot;Rocket Balls&quot; were little match for the competitors&#x27; larger calibers. Wesson had left Volcanic soon after it was formed and Smith followed eight months later, to create the Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver Company. Volcanic moved to New Haven in 1856, but by the end of that year became insolvent. Oliver Winchester purchased the bankrupt firm&#x27;s assets from the remaining stockholders and reorganized it as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857.

Benjamin Henry continued to work with Smith&#x27;s cartridge concept and perfected the much larger, more powerful .44 Henry cartridge. Henry also supervised the redesign of the rifle to use the new ammunition, retaining only the general form of the breech mechanism and the tubular magazine. This became the Henry rifle of 1860, which was manufactured by the New Haven Arms Company, and used in considerable numbers by certain Union army units in the American Civil War. Confederates called the Henry &quot;that damned Yankee rifle that they load on Sunday and shoot all week!&quot;

==Development==
After the war, Oliver Winchester renamed New Haven Arms the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The company modified and improved the basic design of the Henry rifle, creating the first Winchester rifle: the Model 1866. It retained the .44 Henry cartridge, was likewise built on a bronze-alloy frame, and had an improved magazine and a wooden forearm. In 1873 Winchester introduced the steel-framed Model 1873 chambering the more potent .44-40 centerfire cartridge. In 1876, in a bid to compete with the powerful single-shot rifles of the time, Winchester brought out the Model 1876 (&quot;Centennial Model&quot;). While it chambered more powerful cartridges than the 1866 and 1873 models, the toggle link action was not strong enough for the then popular high-powered rounds used in Sharps or Remington single-shot rifles.

From 1883, John Moses Browning worked in partnership with Winchester, designing a series of rifles and shotguns, most notably the lever-action Winchester Model 1886, Model 1892, Model 1894, and Model 1895 rifles, along with the lever-action Model 1887/1901 shotgun, the pump-action Model 1890 rifle, and the pump-action Model 1893/Model 1897 shotgun.

==Winchester lever-action repeating rifles==
===Model 1866===
The first Winchester rifle – the Winchester Model 1866 – was originally chambered for the rimfire .44 Henry. Nicknamed the &quot;Yellow Boy&quot; because of its receiver of a bronze/brass alloy called gunmetal, it was famous for its rugged construction and lever-action &quot;repeating rifle&quot; mechanism that allowed the user to fire a number of shots before having to reload. Nelson King&#x27;s improved patent remedied flaws in the Henry rifle by incorporating a loading gate on the side of the frame and integrating a round, sealed magazine that was partially covered by a forestock.

France purchased 6,000 Model 1866 rifles along with 4.5 million .44 Henry cartridges during the Franco-Prussian War. The Ottoman Empire purchased 45,000 Model 1866 rifles and 5,000 carbines in 1870 and 1871. These rifles were used in the 1877 Russo-Turkish War, causing much surprise when outnumbered Turks at the Siege of Plevna inflicted many times more casualties than their opponents armed with single-shot Krnka and Berdan rifles. The effect of the 1866 at the siege at Plevna sparked a renewed interest in the adoption of repeating rifles for several European countries. 

The Swiss Army initially selected the Model 1866 to replace their existing single-shot Milbank-Amsler rifles. However, ensuing political pressure to adopt a domestic design resulted in the Vetterli Model 1867, a bolt-action design utilizing a copy of the Winchester&#x27;s tubular magazine, being adopted instead.

Due to public demand, the Model 1866 continued to be manufactured and sold until 1899, mainly because they were less expensive than the later steel-framed centerfire models.

===Model 1873===

The Model 1873 was one of the most successful Winchester rifles of its day, with Winchester marketing it as &quot;The Gun That Won the West&quot;. Still an icon in the modern day, it was manufactured between 1873 and 1923. It was originally chambered for the .44-40 cartridge, which was the first centrefire cartridge manufactured by Winchester and which became immensely popular. The 1873 was later produced chambered for .38-40 and .32-20, both of which would become popular handgun cartridges of the day, allowing users to carry just one type of ammunition. The Model 1873 was produced in three variations: a barrel rifle, a barrel carbine, and a &quot;musket&quot;which was aimed at military contracts and only made up less than 5% of production. (Musket was a term that, at the time, denoted a full-length military-style stock, not to be confused with a true smoothbore musket). The standard rifle-length version was most popular in the 19th century, although Winchester would make rifles to order in any configuration the customer wished, including longer barrels or baby carbines with barrels as short as , octagonal-shaped barrels, color case-hardened receivers and fancy engraving.

The original Model 1873 was never offered in the military revolver .45 Colt cartridge, but a number of modern reproductions are chambered for the round.

To both celebrate and enhance the Model 1873&#x27;s prestige, Winchester established a coveted &quot;One of One Thousand&quot; grade in 1875. Barrels producing unusually small groupings during test-firing were fitted to rifles with set triggers and a special finish. Marked &quot;One of One Thousand&quot;, they sold for a then pricey $100 (Worth about $2,612.90 as of 2024). A popular 1950 Western starring James Stewart, &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, was based on the coveted gun. Promotions included a search for &quot;One of One Thousand&quot; rifles by Universal Studios, with advertisements in sporting magazines and posters in sporting goods stores.

A second grade of Model 1873 barrels producing above average accuracy were fitted to rifles marked &quot;One of One Hundred&quot;, and sold for $20 over list. Approximately 136 &quot;One of One Thousand&quot; Model 1873s were sold, and only eight &quot;One of One Hundred&quot; rifles.

In all, over 720,000 Model 1873s were produced up until 1923. With a return to popularity due to present-day Cowboy action shooting, &#x27;73 rifles and carbines of a high quality have been made in Italy by Uberti, encouraging a return to production under license from the Olin company in 2013, joining the Model 1892 and the Model 1894 being manufactured in Japan by the Miroku Corporation for FN/Browning. Nearly faithful in design to the original, including the trigger disconnect safety, sliding dustcover, and a crescent-shaped buttplate, it incorporates two safety improvements: a firing pin block preventing it from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled, and a cartridge carrier modification to eject used casings away from the shooter.

In 2014, a weathered Model 1873 was found leaning against a tree in Great Basin National Park. It became known as the Forgotten Winchester and sparked media interest because of the mystery about who left it there and why they never came back for it.

===Model 1876===
The Winchester Model 1876, or &quot;Centennial Model&quot;, was a heavier-framed rifle than the Models 1866 and 1873, chambered for full-powered centerfire rifle cartridges suitable for big-game hunting, rather than the handgun-sized rimfire and centerfire rounds of its predecessors. While similar in design to the 1873, the 1876 was actually based on a prototype 1868 lever-action rifle that was never commercially produced by Winchester.

Introduced to celebrate the American Centennial Exposition, the Model 1876 earned a reputation as a durable and powerful hunting rifle. Four versions were produced: a barrel &quot;Carbine&quot;, a barrel &quot;Express Rifle&quot; with a half-length magazine, a barrel &quot;Sporting Rifle&quot;, and a barrel &quot;Musket&quot;. Standard rifles had a blued finish while deluxe models were casehardened. Collectors identify a first model with no dust cover, a second model with a dust cover rail fastened by a screw, and a third model with an integral dust cover. Total production was 63,871 including 54 &quot;One of One Thousand&quot; Model 1876s and only seven of the &quot;One of One Hundred&quot; grade.

Originally chambered for the new .45-75 Winchester &quot;Centennial&quot; cartridge (designed to replicate the .45-70 ballistics in a shorter case), the Model 1876 also had versions in .40-60 Winchester, .45-60 Winchester and .50-95 Express; the &#x27;76 in the latter chambering is the only repeater known to have been in widespread use by professional buffalo hunters. The Canadian North-West Mounted Police used the &#x27;76 in .45-75 as a standard long arm for many years with 750 rifles purchased for the force in 1883; the Mountie-model &#x27;76 carbine was also issued to the Texas Rangers. Theodore Roosevelt used an engraved, pistol-gripped half-magazine &#x27;76 during his early hunting expeditions in the West and praised it. A &#x27;76 was also found in the possession of Apache warrior Geronimo after his surrender in 1886.

The Model 1876 toggle-link action receiver was too short to handle popular big-game cartridges, including the .45-70, and production ceased in 1897, as big-game hunters preferred the Model 1886 action chambered for longer and more powerful cartridges.

===Model 1886===

The Model 1886 continued the trend towards chambering heavier rounds and had an all-new and considerably stronger locking-block action than the toggle-link Model 1876. It was designed by John Moses Browning, who had a long and profitable relationship with Winchester from the 1880s to the early 1900s. William Mason made some improvements to Browning&#x27;s original design. In many respects, the Model 1886 was a true American express rifle, as it could be chambered in the more powerful black powder cartridges of the day, such as the .45-70 Government, long a Winchester goal. The 1886 proved capable of handling not only the .45 Gov&#x27;t but also .45-90 and the huge .50-110 Express &quot;buffalo&quot; cartridges, and in 1903 was chambered for the smokeless high-velocity .33 Winchester. In 1935, Winchester introduced a slightly modified M1886 as the Model 71, chambered for the more powerful .348 Winchester cartridge.

===Model 1892===

In order to compete with newer Marlin offerings, Winchester returned to its roots with the Model 1892, which was chambered for the same low-pressure cartridges as the Model 1873. The Model 1892 incorporates a much-stronger Browning action that was a scaled-down version of the Model 1886. It was also a much lighter rifle than the 1873 model, with which it was sold concurrently for over twenty years, for the same price.

A total of 1,004,675 Model 1892 rifles were made by Winchester, and it was exported internationally, becoming very popular in South America and Australasia. Although Winchester stopped manufacture in 1941, today versions are still being made by the Brazilian arms maker Amadeo Rossi, and by Chiappa Firearms, an Italian maker. In its modern form, using updated materials and production techniques, the Model 1892&#x27;s action is strong enough to chamber high-pressure handgun rounds, such as .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .454 Casull. The Winchester &#x27;92 was often used in Hollywood Western movies and TV shows out of its correct period, achieving some fame as a &#x27;cowboy&#x27; lever action, although it was historically too late for that.

===Model 1894===
The John Browning–designed Winchester Model 1894 is the most prevalent of the Winchester repeating rifles. The Model 1894 was first chambered for the .32-40 and .38-55 cartridges, and later, a variety of calibers such as .25-35 WCF, .30-30, and .32 Winchester Special. Winchester was the first company to manufacture a civilian rifle chambered for the new smokeless propellants, and although delays prevented the .30-30 cartridge from appearing on the shelves until 1895, it remained the first commercially available smokeless powder round for the North American consumer market. Though it was initially too expensive for most shooters, the Model 1894 went on to become one of the best-selling hunting rifles of all timeit had the distinction of being the first sporting rifle to sell over one million units, ultimately selling over seven million before U.S.-production was discontinued in 2006. The Winchester .30-30 configuration is practically synonymous with &quot;deer rifle&quot; in the United States. In the early 20th century, the rifle&#x27;s designation was abbreviated to &quot;Model 94&quot;, as was done with all older Winchester designs still in production (for example, Model 97, Model 12, etc.).

===Model 1895===

The Winchester Model 1895 has the distinction of being the first Winchester lever-action rifle to load from an internal box magazine instead of from an internal tube magazine under the barrel. This allowed the Model 1895 to be chambered for military cartridges with spitzer (pointed) projectiles, and the rifle was used by the armed forces of a number of nations including the United States, Great Britain, and Imperial Russia. The Russian production models could also be loaded using charger clips, a feature not found on any other lever-action rifle. Calibers included .30-40 Krag (.30 US or .30 Army), .303 British, .30-03 Springfield, .30-06 Springfield, 7.62×54mmR, and .405 Winchester. Theodore Roosevelt used a Model 1895 in .405 on African safaris and called it his &quot;medicine gun&quot; for lions. In 1908, the 1895 Winchester became the first commercially produced sporting rifle chambered in .30-06 (then called &quot;.30 Gov&#x27;t 06&quot;).

===Model 88===
Introduced in 1955, 60 years after Winchester&#x27;s last all-new lever-action design, the Model 88 was unlike any previous lever-action. A short-throw lever operated a three-lug rotating bolt and rounds were fed vertically from a detachable box magazine: in effect, it was lever-operated bolt action. These features in a lever-action permitted the use of high-powered modern short-case cartridges with spitzer bullets: .243 Winchester, .284 Winchester, .308 Winchester (essentially 7.62x51mm NATO), and .358 Winchester. The Model 88 was discontinued in 1973 and is the third best-selling lever-action rifle in Winchester&#x27;s history, following only the M1894 and M1892. The later Sako Finnwolf and Browning BLR have similar actions. The Model 88 Carbine was offered with a barrel.

===Model 9422===

Winchester&#x27;s Model 9422 was introduced in 1972. It was designed to capture the image of the traditional lever-actions with exposed hammer, straight grip, tube magazine and barrel bands. Unlike older Winchester lever actions it came grooved for scope mounting. It was offered in .22 Long Rifle and .22 WMR, and was priced at the high end of the .22 LR sporting rifle market.

The 9422 action design was original and extremely reliable. The feed system handled the cartridge from the magazine to the breech face by its rim, and the slide cammed the rear of the breechblock up into the locking recess. A concealed polymer buffer above the breech gave a firm-feeling lockup and a very positive unlocking motion.

The 9422 had worldwide appeal to customers raised on Western fiction and to parents looking for a way to introduce their children to shooting. Over the course of production, a higher-finished model called the 9422 XTR, a .17 rimfire model, and several commemorative models were offered. Production ended in 2005.

==New production==
In 2013, Winchester brought back the Model 1873, manufactured under license from the Olin company by FN/Browning in the Kōchi Prefecture of Japan by the Miroku Corporation. It joins the Model 1892 and Model 1894 as the third classic Winchester rifle model to be reintroduced. The new 1873 model is available with a barrel, either round or octagonal, and a chambering of .357 Magnum/.38 Special, .44-40 Winchester, or .45 Colt. It is nearly identical in design to the originals including the trigger disconnect safety, sliding dustcover, and crescent-shaped buttplate, but with two notable exceptions. An additional safety mechanism, a firing pin block that prevents it from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled, was integrated, and the cartridge carrier was changed to eject used casings away from the shooter. The fixed, tubular magazine has a maximum capacity of fourteen rounds (thirteen for .44 and .45 caliber rifles).
