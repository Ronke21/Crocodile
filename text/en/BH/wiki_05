<text>Safed (also known as Tzfat; , &quot;Ṣəfaṯ&quot;; , &quot;Ṣafad&quot;) is a city in the Northern District of Israel. Located at an elevation of up to , Safed is the highest city in the Galilee and in Israel.

Safed has been identified with &quot;Sepph&quot; (Σέπφ), a fortified town in the Upper Galilee mentioned in the writings of the Roman Jewish historian Josephus. The Jerusalem Talmud mentions Safed as one of five elevated spots where fires were lit to announce the New Moon and festivals during the Second Temple period. Safed attained local prominence under the Crusaders, who built a large fortress there in 1168. It was conquered by Saladin 20 years later, and demolished by his grandnephew al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa in 1219. After reverting to the Crusaders in a treaty in 1240, a larger fortress was erected, which was expanded and reinforced in 1268 by the Mamluk sultan Baybars, who developed Safed into a major town and the capital of a new province spanning the Galilee. After a century of general decline, the stability brought by the Ottoman conquest in 1517 ushered in nearly a century of growth and prosperity in Safed, during which time Jewish immigrants from across Europe developed the city into a center for wool and textile production and the mystical Kabbalah movement. It became known as one of the Four Holy Cities of Judaism. As the capital of the Safad Sanjak, it was the main population center of the Galilee, with large Muslim and Jewish communities. Besides during the fortunate governorship of Fakhr al-Din II in the early 17th century, the city underwent a general decline and by the mid-18th century was eclipsed by Acre. Its Jewish residents were targeted in Druze and local Muslim raids in the 1830s, and many perished in an earthquake in that same decade – through the philanthropy of Moses Montefiore, its Jewish synagogues and homes were rebuilt.

Safed&#x27;s population reached 24,000 toward the end of the 19th century; it was a mixed city, divided roughly equally between Jews and Muslims with a small Christian community. Its Muslim merchants played a key role as middlemen in the grain trade between the local farmers and the traders of Acre, while the Ottomans promoted the city as a center of Sunni jurisprudence. Safed&#x27;s conditions improved considerably in the late 19th century, a municipal council was established along with a number of banks, though the city&#x27;s jurisdiction was limited to the Upper Galilee. By 1922, Safed&#x27;s population had dropped to around 8,700, roughly 60% Muslim, 33% Jewish and the remainder Christians. Amid rising ethnic tension throughout Mandatory Palestine, Safed&#x27;s Jews were attacked in an Arab riot in 1929. The city&#x27;s population had risen to 13,700 by 1948, overwhelmingly Arab, though the city was proposed to be part of a Jewish state in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. During the 1948 war, Arab factions attacked and besieged the Jewish quarter which held out until Jewish paramilitary forces captured the city after heavy fighting, precipitating British forces to withdraw. Most of the city&#x27;s predominantly Palestinian-Arab population fled or were expelled as a result of attacks by Jewish forces and the nearby Ein al-Zeitun massacre, and were not allowed to return after the war, such that today the city has an almost exclusively Jewish population. That year, the city became part of the then-newly established state of Israel.
Safed has a large Haredi community and remains a center for Jewish religious studies. Safed today hosts the Ziv Hospital as well as the Zefat Academic College. Safed is a major subject in Israeli art, it hosts an Artists&#x27; Quarter. Several prominent art movements played a role in the city, most notably the École de Paris. However the Artists&#x27; quarter has declined since its golden age in the second half of the 20th century. Due to its high elevation, the city has warm summers and cold, often snowy winters. Its mild climate and scenic views have made Safed a popular holiday resort frequented by Israelis and foreign visitors. In it had a population of .

==Biblical reference==
Legend has it that Safed was founded by a son of Noah after the Great Flood. According to the Book of Judges (), the area where Safed is located was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali.

It has been suggested that Jesus&#x27; assertion that &quot;a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden&quot; referred to Safed.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Safed has been identified with &quot;Sepph,&quot; a fortified town in the Upper Galilee mentioned in the writings of the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus. Safed is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud as one of five elevated spots where fires were lit to announce the New Moon and festivals during the Second Temple period.

===Crusader era===
====Pre-Crusader village and tower====
There is scarce information about Safed before the Crusader conquest. A document from the Cairo Geniza, composed in 1034, mentions a transaction made in Tiberias in 1023 by a certain Jew, Musa ben Hiba ben Salmun with the &quot;nisba&quot; (Arabic descriptive suffix) &quot;al-Safati&quot; (of Safed), indicating the presence of a Jewish community living alongside Muslims in Safed in the 11th century. According to the Muslim historian Ibn Shaddad (d. 1285), at the beginning of the 12th century, a &quot;flourishing village&quot; beneath a tower called Burj Yatim had existed at the site of Safed on the eve of the Crusaders&#x27; capture of the area in 1101–1102 and that &quot;nothing&quot; about the village was mentioned in &quot;the early Islamic history books&quot;. Although Ibn Shaddad mistakenly attributes the tower&#x27;s construction to the Knights Templar, the modern historian Ronnie Ellenblum asserts that the tower was likely built during the early Muslim period (mid-7th–11th centuries).

====First Crusader period====
The Frankish chronicler William of Tyre noted the presence of a &quot;burgus&quot; (tower) in Safed, which he called &quot;Castrum Saphet&quot; or &quot;Sephet&quot;, in 1157. Safed was the seat of a &quot;castellany&quot; (area governed by a castle) by at least 1165, when its &quot;castellan&quot; (appointed castle governor) was Fulk, constable of Tiberias. The castle of Safed was purchased from Fulk by King Amalric of Jerusalem in 1168. He subsequently reinforced the castle and transferred it to the Templars in the same year. Theoderich the Monk, describing his visit to the area in 1172, noted that the expanded fortification of the castle of Safed was meant to check the raids of the Turks (the Turkic Zengid dynasty ruled the area east of the Kingdom). Testifying to the considerable expansion of the castle, the chronicler Jacques de Vitry (d. 1240) wrote that it was practically built anew. The remains of Fulk&#x27;s castle can now be found under the citadel excavations, on a hill above the old city.

In the estimation of modern historian Havré Barbé, the &quot;castellany&quot; of Safed comprised approximately . According to Barbé, its western boundary straddled the domains of Acre, including the fief of St. George de la Beyne, which included Sajur and Beit Jann, and the fief of Geoffrey le Tor, which included Akbara and Hurfeish, and in the southwest ran north of Maghar and Sallama. Its northern boundary was marked by the Nahal Dishon (Wadi al-Hindaj) stream, its southern boundary was likely formed near Wadi al-Amud, separating it from the fief of Tiberias, while its eastern limits were the marshes of the Hula Valley and upper Jordan Valley. There were several Jewish communities in the &quot;castellany&quot; of Safed, as testified in the accounts of Jewish pilgrims and chroniclers between 1120 and 1293. Benjamin of Tudela, who visited the town in 1170, does not record any Jews living in Safed proper.

====Ayyubid interregnum====
Safed was captured by the Ayyubids led by Sultan Saladin in 1188 after a month-long siege, following the Battle of Hattin in 1187. Saladin ultimately allowed its residents to relocate to Tyre. He granted Safed and Tiberias as an &quot;iqta&quot; (akin to a fief) to Sa&#x27;d al-Din Mas&#x27;ud ibn Mubarak (d. 1211), the son of his niece, after which it was bequeathed to Sa&#x27;d al-Din&#x27;s son Ahmad. Samuel ben Samson, who visited the town in 1210, mentions the existence of a Jewish community of at least fifty there. He also noted that two Muslims guarded and maintained the cave tomb of a rabbi, Hanina ben Horqano, in Safed. The &quot;iqta&quot; of Safed was taken from the family of Sa&#x27;d al-Din by the Ayyubid emir of Damascus, al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa, in 1217. Two years later, during the Crusader siege of Damietta, al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa had the Safed castle demolished to prevent its capture and reuse by potential future Crusaders.

====Second Crusader period====
As an outcome of the treaty negotiations between the Crusader leader Theobald I of Navarre and the Ayyubid al-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus, in 1240 Safed once again passed to Crusader control. Afterward, the Templars were tasked with rebuilding the Citadel of Safed, with efforts spearheaded by Benedict of Alignan, Bishop of Marseille. The rebuilding is recorded in a short treatise, &quot;De constructione castri Saphet&quot;, from the early 1260s. The reconstruction was completed at the considerable expense of 40,000 bezants in 1243. The new fortress was larger than the original, with a capacity for 2,200 soldiers in time of war, and with a resident force of 1,700 in peacetime. The garrison&#x27;s goods and services were provided by the town or large village growing rapidly beneath the fortress, which, according to Benoit&#x27;s account, contained a market, &quot;numerous inhabitants&quot; and was protected by the fortress. The settlement also benefited from trade with travelers on the route between Acre and the Jordan Valley, which passed through Safed.

===Mamluk period===
The Ayyubids of Egypt had been supplanted by the Mamluks in 1250 and the Mamluk sultan Baybars entered Syria with his army in 1261. Thereafter, he led a series of campaigns over several years against Crusader strongholds across the Syrian coastal mountains. Safed, with its position overlooking the Jordan River and allowing the Crusaders early warnings of Muslim troop movements in the area, had been a consistent aggravation for the Muslim regional powers. After a six-week siege, Baybars captured Safed in July 1266, after which he had nearly the entire garrison killed. The siege occurred during a Mamluk military campaign to subdue Crusader strongholds in Palestine and followed a failed attempt to capture the Crusaders&#x27; coastal stronghold of Acre. Unlike the Crusader fortresses along the coastline, which were demolished upon their capture by the Mamluks, Baybars spared the fortress of Safed. He likely preserved it because of the strategic value stemming from its location on a high mountain and its isolation from other Crusader fortresses. Moreover, Baybars determined that in the event of a renewed Crusader invasion of the coastal region, a strongly fortified Safed could serve as an ideal headquarters to confront the Crusader threat. In 1268, he had the fortress repaired, expanded and strengthened. He commissioned numerous building works in the town of Safed, including caravanserais, markets and baths, and converted the town&#x27;s church into a mosque. The mosque, called Jami al-Ahmar (the Red Mosque), was completed in 1275. By the end of Baybars&#x27;s reign, Safed had developed into a prosperous town and fortress.

Baybars assigned fifty-four mamluks, at the head of whom was Emir Ala al-Din Kandaghani, to oversee the management of Safed and its dependencies. From the time of its capture, the city was made the administrative center of Mamlakat Safad, one of seven &quot;mamlakas&quot; (provinces), whose governors were typically appointed from Cairo, which made up Mamluk Syria. Initially, its jurisdiction corresponded roughly with the Crusader &quot;castellany&quot;. After the fall of the Montfort Castle to the Mamluks in 1271, the castle and its dependency, the Shaghur district, were incorporated into Mamlakat Safad. The territorial jurisdiction of the &quot;mamlaka&quot; eventually spanned the entire Galilee and the lands further south down to Jenin.

The geographer al-Dimashqi, who died in Safed in 1327, wrote around 1300 that Baybars built a &quot;round tower and called it Kullah ...&quot; after leveling the old fortress. The tower was built in three stories, and provided with provisions, halls, and magazines. Under the structure, a cistern collected enough rainwater to regularly supply the garrison. The governor of Safed, Emir Baktamur al-Jukandar (the Polomaster; ), built a mosque later called after him in the northeastern section of the city. The geographer Abu&#x27;l Fida (1273–1331), the ruler of Hama, described Safed as follows:[Safed] was a town of medium size. It has a very strongly built castle, which dominates the Lake of Tabariyyah [Sea of Galilee]. There are underground watercourses, which bring drinking-water up to the castle-gate...Its suburbs cover three hills... Since the place was conquered by Al Malik Adh Dhahir [Baybars] from the Franks [Crusaders], it has been made the central station for the troops who guard all the coast-towns of that district.&quot;

The native &quot;qadi&quot; (Islamic head judge) of Safed, Shams al-Din al-Uthmani, composed a text about Safed called &quot;Ta&#x27;rikh Safad&quot; (the History of Safed) during the rule of its governor Emir Alamdar (). The extant parts of the work consisted of ten folios largely devoted to Safed&#x27;s distinguishing qualities, its dependent villages, agriculture, trade and geography, with no information about its history. His account reveals the city&#x27;s dominant features were its citadel, the Red Mosque and its towering position over the surrounding landscape. He noted Safed lacked &quot;regular urban planning&quot;, &quot;madrasas&quot; (schools of Islamic law), &quot;ribats&quot; (hostels for military volunteers) and defensive walls, and that its houses were clustered in disarray and its streets were not distinguishable from its squares. He attributed the city&#x27;s shortcomings to the dearth of generous patrons. A device for transporting buckets of water called the &quot;satura&quot; existed in the city mainly to supply the soldiers of the citadel; surplus water was distributed to the city&#x27;s residents. Al-Uthmani praised the natural beauty of Safed, its therapeutic air, and noted that its residents took strolls in the surrounding gorges and ravines.

The Black Death brought about a decline in the population in Safed from 1348 onward. There is little available information about the city and its dependencies during the last century of Mamluk rule (), though travelers&#x27; accounts describe a general decline precipitated by famine, plagues, natural disasters and political instability.

===Ottoman era===
====Sixteenth-century prosperity====

The Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria following their victory at the Battle of Marj Dabiq in northern Syria in 1516. Safed&#x27;s inhabitants sent the keys of the town citadel to Sultan Selim I after he captured Damascus. No fighting was recorded around Safed, which was bypassed by Selim&#x27;s army on the way to Mamluk Egypt. The sultan had placed the district of Safed under the jurisdiction of the Mamluk governor of Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, who defected to the Ottomans. Rumors in 1517 that Selim was slain by the Mamluks precipitated a revolt against the newly appointed Ottoman governor by the townspeople of Safed, which resulted in wide-scale killings, many of which targeted the city&#x27;s Jews, who were viewed as sympathizers of the Ottomans. Safed became the capital of the Safed Sanjak, roughly corresponding with Mamlakat Safad but excluding most of the Jezreel Valley and the area of Atlit, part of the larger province of Damascus Eyalet.

In 1525/26, the population of Safed consisted of 633 Muslim families, 40 Muslim bachelors, 26 Muslim religious persons, nine Muslim disabled, 232 Jewish families, and 60 military families. In 1549, under Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a wall was constructed and troops were garrisoned to protect the city. In 1553/54, the population consisted of 1,121 Muslim households, 222 Muslim bachelors, 54 Muslim religious leaders, 716 Jewish households, 56 Jewish bachelors, and 9 disabled persons. At least in the 16th century, Safed was the only &quot;kasaba&quot; (city) in the sanjak and in 1555 was divided into nineteen &quot;mahallas&quot; (quarters), seven Muslim and twelve Jewish. The total population of Safed rose from 926 households in 1525–26 to 1,931 households in 1567–1568. Among these, the Jewish population rose from a mere 233 households in 1525 to 945 households in 1567–1568. The Muslim quarters were Sawawin, located west of the fortress; Khandaq (the moat); Ghazzawiyah, which had likely been settled by Gazans; Jami&#x27; al-Ahmar (the Red Mosque), located south of the fortress and named for the local mosque; al-Akrad, which dated to the Middle Ages and continued to exist through the 19th century, and whose inhabitants mainly were Kurds; al-Wata (the lower), the southernmost quarter of Safed and situated below the city; and al-Suq, named after the market or mosque located within the quarter. The Jewish quarters were all situated west of the fortress. Each quarter was named for the place of origin of its inhabitants: Purtuqal (Portugal), Qurtubah (Cordoba), Qastiliyah (Castille), Musta&#x27;rib (Jews of local, Arabic-speaking origin), Magharibah (northwestern Africa), Araghun ma&#x27; Qatalan (Aragon and Catalonia), Majar (Hungary), Puliah (Apulia), Qalabriyah (Calabria), Sibiliyah (Seville), Taliyan (Italian) and Alaman (German).

In the 15th and 16th centuries there were several well-known Sufis (mystics) of ibn Arabi living in Safed. The Sufi sage Ahmad al-Asadi (1537–1601) established a &quot;zawiya&quot; (Sufi lodge) called Sadr Mosque in the city. Safed became a center of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) during the 16th century.

After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, many prominent rabbis found their way to Safed, among them the Kabbalists Isaac Luria and Moses ben Jacob Cordovero; Joseph Caro, the author of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;; and Solomon Alkabetz, composer of the Shabbat hymn &quot;Lekha Dodi&quot;.
The influx of Sephardic Jews—reaching its peak under the rule of sultans Suleiman the Magnificent and Selim II—made Safed a global center for Jewish learning and a regional center for trade throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. Sephardi Jews and other Jewish immigrants by then outnumbered Musta&#x27;arabi Jews in the city.

During this period, the Jewish community developed the textile industry in Safed, transforming the town into an important and lucrative wool production and textile manufacturing centre. There were more than 7,000 Jews in Safed in 1576 when Murad III proclaimed the forced deportation of 1,000 wealthy Jewish families to Cyprus to boost the island&#x27;s economy. There is no evidence that the edict or a second one issued the following year for removing 500 families, was enforced. In 1584, there were 32 synagogues registered in the town.

A Hebrew printing press, the first in West Asia, was established in Safed in 1577 by Eliezer ben Isaac Ashkenazi of Prague and his son, Isaac.

====Political decline, attacks and natural disasters====
By the early part of the 17th century, Safed was a small town. In 1602, the paramount chief of the Druze in Mount Lebanon, Fakhr al-Din II of the Ma&#x27;n dynasty, was appointed the sanjak-bey (district governor) of Safed, in addition to his governorship of neighbouring Sidon-Beirut Sanjak to the north. In the preceding years, the Safed Sanjak had entered a state of ruin and desolation and was often the scene of conflict between the local Druze and Shia Muslim peasants and the Ottoman authorities. By 1605, Fakhr al-Din had established peace and security in the sanjak, with highway brigandage and Bedouin raids having ceased under his watch. Trade and agriculture consequently thrived and the population prospered. He formed close relations with the city&#x27;s Sunni Muslim ulama (religious scholars), particularly the mufti, al-Khalidi al-Safadi of the Hanafi school of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), who became his practical court historian.

The Ottomans drove Fakhr al-Din into European exile in 1613, but his son Ali became governor in 1615. Fakhr al-Din returned to his domains in 1618 and five years later regained the governorship of Safed, which the Ma&#x27;n dynasty had lost, after his victory against the governor of Damascus at the Battle of Anjar. In , the orientalist Franciscus Quaresmius spoke of Safed being inhabited &quot;chiefly by Hebrews, who had their synagogues and schools, and for whose sustenance contributions were made by the Jews in other parts of the world.&quot; According to the historian Louis Finkelstein, the Jewish community of Safed was plundered by the Druze under Mulhim ibn Yunus, nephew of Fakhr al-Din. Five years later, Fakhr al-Din was routed by the Ottoman governor of Damascus, Mulhim abandoned Safed, and its Jewish residents returned.

The Druze again attacked the Jews of Safed in 1656. During the power struggle between Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s heirs (1658–1667), each faction attacked Safed. In the intra-communal turmoil among the Druze following the death of Mulhim, the 1660 destruction of Safed targeted the Jews there and in Tiberias; only a few of the former Jewish residents returned to the city before 1662. Survivors relocated mainly to Sidon or Jerusalem.

Safed Sanjak and the neighbouring Sidon-Beirut Sanjak to the north were administratively separated from Damascus in 1660 to form the Sidon Eyalet, of which Safed was briefly the capital. The province was created by the imperial government to check the power of the Druze of Mount Lebanon, as well as the Shia of Jabal Amil.

As nearby Tiberias remained desolate for several decades, Safed gained a key position among Galilean Jewish communities. In 1665, the Sabbatai Sevi movement arrived in Safed. In the 1670s, the account of the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi recorded that Safed contained three caravanserais, several mosques, seven zawiyas, and six hammams. The Red Mosque was restored by Safed&#x27;s governor Salih Bey in 1671/72, at which point it measured about , had all masonry interior, a cistern to collect rainwater in the winter for drinking and a tall minaret over its southern entrance; the minaret had been destroyed before the end of the 17th century.

The Tiberias-based sheikh Zahir al-Umar of the local Arab Zaydan clan, whose father Umar al-Zaydani had been the governor and tax farmer of Safed in 1702–1706, wrested control of Safed and its tax farm from its native strongman, Muhammad Naf&#x27;i, through military pressure and diplomacy by 1740. The Naf&#x27;i, Shahin, and Murad families continued to farm the taxes of Safed and its countryside into the 1760s as Zahir&#x27;s subordinates. By the 1760s, Zahir entrusted Safed to his son Ali, who made the town his headquarters. After Zahir was killed by Ottoman imperial forces, the governor of Sidon, Jazzar Pasha, moved to oust Zahir&#x27;s sons from their Galilee strongholds. Ali made a final, unsuccessful stand against Jazzar Pasha from Safed, which was afterward captured and garrisoned by the governor. The simultaneous rise of Acre, established by Zahir as his capital in 1750 and which served as the capital of the Sidon Eyalet under Jazzar Pasha (1775–1804) and his successors, Sulayman Pasha al-Adil (1805–1819) and Abdullah Pasha (1820–1831), contributed to the political decline of Safed. It became a subdistrict center with limited local influence, belonging to the Acre Sanjak .

Underdevelopment and a series of natural disasters further contributed to Safed&#x27;s decline during the 17th–mid-19th centuries. An outbreak of plague decimated the population in 1742 and the Near East earthquakes of 1759 left the city in ruins, killing 200 residents. An influx of Russian Jews in 1776 and 1781, and of Lithuanian Jews of the Perushim movement in 1809 and 1810, reinvigorated the Jewish community. In 1812, another plague killed 80% of the Jewish population. Following Abdullah Pasha of Acre&#x27;s ordered killing of his Jewish vizier Haim Farhi, who served the same post under Jazzar and Sulayman, the governor imprisoned the Jewish residents of Safed on 12 August 1820, accusing them of tax evasion under the concealment of Farhi; they were released upon paying a ransom. The war between Abdullah Pasha and the influential Farhi brothers in Constantinople and Damascus in 1822–1823 prompted Jewish flight from the Galilee in general, though by 1824 Jewish immigrants were steadily moving to the city.

The forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt wrested control of the Levant from the Ottomans in 1831 and in the same year many Jews who had fled the Galilee, including Safed, under Abdullah Pasha returned as a result of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s liberal policies toward Jews. Safed was raided by Druze in 1833 at the approach of Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian governor of the Levant. In the following year, the Muslim notables of the city, led by Salih al-Tarshihi, opposed to the Egyptian policy of conscription, joined the peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine. During the revolt, rebels plundered the city for over thirty days. Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon and his Druze fighters entered its environs in support of the Egyptians and compelled Safed&#x27;s leaders to surrender. The Galilee earthquake of 1837 killed about half of Safed&#x27;s 4,000-strong Jewish community, destroyed all fourteen of its synagogues and prompted the flight of 600 Perushim for Jerusalem; the surviving Sephardic and Hasidic Jews mostly remained. Among the 2,158 residents of Safed who had died, 1,507 were Ottoman subjects, the rest foreign citizens. The Jewish quarter was situated on the hillside and was particularly hard hit; the southern and Muslim section of the town experienced considerably less damage. The following year, in 1838, Druze rebels and local Muslims raided Safed for three days.

====Tanzimat reforms and revival====
Ottoman rule was restored across the Levant in 1840. The Empire-wide Tanzimat reforms, which were first adopted in the 1840s, brought about a steady rise in Safed&#x27;s population and economy. In 1849 Safed had a total estimated population of 5,000, of whom 2,940–3,440 were Muslims, 1,500-2,000 were Jews and 60 were Christians. The population was estimated at 7,000 in 1850–1855, of whom 2,500–3,000 were Jews. The Jewish population increased in the last half of the 19th century by immigration from Persia, Morocco, and Algeria. Moses Montefiore (d. 1885) visited Safed seven times and financed much of the rebuilding of Safed&#x27;s synagogues and Jewish houses.

In 1864 the Sidon Eyalet was absorbed into the new province of Syria Vilayet. In the new province, Safed remained part of the Acre Sanjak and served as the center of a kaza (third-level subdivision), whose jurisdiction covered the villages around the city and the subdistrict of Mount Meron (Jabal Jarmaq). In the Ottoman survey of Syria in 1871, Safed had 1,395 Muslim households, 1,197 Jewish households and three Christian households. The survey recorded a relatively high number of businesses in the city, namely 227 shops, fifteen mills, fourteen bakeries and four olive oil factories, an indicator of Safed&#x27;s long-established role as an economic hub for the people of the Upper Galilee, the Hula Valley, the Golan Heights and parts of modern-day South Lebanon. Through the late 19th century, Safed&#x27;s merchants served as middlemen in the Galilee grain trade, selling the wheat, pulses and fruit grown by the peasants of the Galilee to the traders of Acre, who in turn exported at least part of the merchandise to Europe. Safed also maintained extensive trade with the port of Tyre. The bulk of trade in Safed, which was traditionally dominated by the city&#x27;s Jews, largely passed to its Muslim merchants during the late 19th century, particularly trade with the local villagers; Muslim traders offered higher credit to the peasants and were able to obtain government assistance for debt repayments. The wealth of Safed&#x27;s Muslims increased and a number of the city&#x27;s leading Muslim families made an opportunity from the Ottoman Land Code of 1858 to purchase extensive tracts around Safed. The major Muslim landowning clans were the Soubeh, Murad and Qaddura. The latter owned about 50,000 dunams toward the end of the century, including eight villages around Safed.

In 1878 the municipal council of Safed was established. In 1888 the Acre Sanjak, including the Safed Kaza, became part of the new province of Beirut Vilayet, an administrative state of affairs which persisted until the Empire&#x27;s fall in 1918. The centralization and stability brought by the imperial reforms solidified the political status and practical influence of Safed in the Upper Galilee. The Ottomans developed Safed into a center for Sunni Islam to counterbalance the influence of non-Muslim communities in its environs and the Shia Muslims of Jabal Amil. Along with the three major landowning families, the Muslim &quot;ulema&quot; (religious scholarly) families of Nahawi, Qadi, Mufti and Naqib comprised the urban elite (&quot;a&#x27;yan&quot;) of the city. The Sunni courts of Safed arbitrated over cases in Akbara, Ein al-Zeitun and as far away as Mejdel Islim. According to the late 19th-century account of British missionary E. W. G. Masterman, the Muslim families of Safed included Kurds, Damascenes, Algerians, Bedouin from the Jordan Valley, and people from the villages around Safed. Many Damascenes had been settled in the city by Baybars when he conquered Safed in 1266. Until the late 19th century the Muslims of Safed maintained strong social and cultural connections with Damascus. The government settled Algerian and Circassian exiles in the countryside of Safed in the 1860s and 1878, respectively, possibly in an effort to strengthen the Muslim character of the area. At least two Muslim families in the city itself, Arabi and Delasi, were of Algerian origin, though they accounted for a small proportion of the city&#x27;s overall Muslim population. Masterman noted that the Muslims of Safed were conservative, &quot;active and hardy&quot;, who &quot;dress[ed] well and move[d] about more than the people from the region of southern Palestine&quot;. They lived mainly in three quarters of the city: al-Akrad, whose residents were mostly laborers, Sawawin, home to the Muslim &quot;a&#x27;yan&quot; households and the city&#x27;s Catholic community, and al-Wata, whose inhabitants were largely shopkeepers and minor traders. The entire Jewish population lived in the Gharbieh (western) quarter.

Safed&#x27;s population reached over 15,000 in 1879, 8,000 of whom were Muslims and 7,000 Jews. A population list from about 1887 showed that Safad had 24,615 inhabitants; 2,650 Jewish households, 2,129 Muslim households and 144 Roman Catholic households. Arab families in Safed whose social status rose as a result of the Tanzimat reforms included the Asadi, whose presence in Safed dated to the 16th century, Hajj Sa&#x27;id, Hijazi, Bisht, Hadid, Khouri, a Christian family whose progenitor moved to the city from Mount Lebanon during the 1860 civil war, and Sabbagh, a long-established Christian family in the city related to Zahir al-Umar&#x27;s fiscal adviser Ibrahim al-Sabbagh; many members of these families became officials in the civil service, local administrations or businessmen. When the Ottomans established a branch of the Agricultural Bank in the city in 1897, all of its board members were resident Arabs, the most influential of whom were Husayn Abd al-Rahim Effendi, Hajj Ahmad al-Asadi, As&#x27;ad Khouri and Abd al-Latif al-Hajj Sa&#x27;id. The latter two also became board members of the Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture branch opened in Safed in 1900. In the last decade of the 19th century, Safed contained 2,000 houses, four mosques, three churches, two public bathhouses, one caravanserai, two public &quot;sabils&quot;, nineteen mills, seven olive oil presses, ten bakeries, fifteen coffeehouses, forty-five stalls and three shops.

===Mandatory Palestine===
Safed was the centre of Safad Subdistrict. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Safed had a population of 8,761 inhabitants, consisting of 5,431 Muslims, 2,986 Jews, 343 Christians and others. Safed remained a mixed city during the British Mandate for Palestine and ethnic tensions between Jews and Arabs rose during the 1920s. During the 1929 Palestine riots, Safed and Hebron became major clash points. In the Safed massacre 20 Jewish residents were killed by local Arabs. Safed was included in the part of Palestine recommended to be included in the proposed Jewish state under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.

By 1948 the city was home to about 12,000 Arabs and about 1,700 Jews, mostly religious and elderly. On 5 January 1948, Arabs attacked the Jewish Quarter. In February 1948, during the civil war, Muslim Arabs attacked a Jewish bus attempting to reach Safed, and the Jewish quarter of the town came under siege by the Muslims. British forces that were present did not intervene. According to Martin Gilbert, food supplies ran short. &quot;Even water and flour were in desperately short supply. Each day, the Arab attackers drew closer to the heart of the Jewish quarter, systematically blowing up Jewish houses as they pressed in on the central area.&quot;

On April 16, the same day that British forces evacuated Safed, 200 local Arab militiamen, supported by over 200 Arab Liberation Army soldiers, tried to take over the city&#x27;s Jewish Quarter. They were repelled by the Jewish garrison, consisting of some 200 Haganah fighters, men and women, boosted by a Palmach platoon.

The Palmach ground attack on the Arab section of Safed took place on 6 May, as a part of Operation Yiftach. The first phase of the Palmach plan to capture Safed, was to secure a corridor through the mountains by capturing the Arab village of Biriyya. The Arab Liberation Army placed artillery pieces on a hill adjacent to the Jewish quarter and started its shelling. The Palmach&#x27;s Third Battalion failed to take the main objective, the &quot;citadel&quot;, but &quot;terrified&quot; the Arab population sufficiently to prompt further flight, as well as urgent appeals for outside help and an effort to obtain a truce.

The secretary-general of the Arab League Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam stated that the goal of Plan Dalet was to drive out the inhabitants of Arab villages along the Syrian and Lebanese frontiers, particularly places on the roads by which Arab regular forces could enter the country. He noted that Acre and Safed were in particular danger. However, the appeals for help were ignored, and the British, now less than a week away from the end of the British Mandate of Palestine, also did not intervene against the second and final Haganah attack, which began on the evening of 9 May, with a mortar barrage on key sites in Safed. Following the barrage, Palmach infantry, in bitter fighting, took the citadel, Beit Shalva and the police fort, Safed&#x27;s three dominant buildings. Through 10 May, Haganah mortars continued to pound the Arab neighbourhoods, causing fires in the marked area and in the fuel dumps, which exploded. &quot;The Palmah &#x27;intentionally left open the exit routes for the population to &quot;facilitate&quot; their exodus...&#x27; &quot; According to Gilbert, &quot;The Arabs of Safed began to leave, including the commander of the Arab forces, Adib Shishakli (later Prime Minister of Syria). With the police fort on Mount Canaan isolated, its defenders withdrew without fighting. The fall of Safed was a blow to Arab morale throughout the region... With the invasion of Palestine by regular Arab armies believed to be imminent – once the British had finally left in eleven or twelve days&#x27; time – many Arabs felt that prudence dictated their departure until the Jews had been defeated and they could return to their homes. According to Abbasi, the exodus of the Arabs of Safed had three phases. The first was due to the departure of the British compounded by the failure of an attack on the Jewish quarter and a disagreement between the Jordanian and Syrian commanders. The second was due to the fall of nearby Ein al-Zeitun and the massacre that Jewish forces committed there. The third was due to the deliberate creation of panic by Jewish forces.

Some 12,000 Arabs, with some estimates reaching 15,000, fled Safed and were a &quot;heavy burden on the Arab war effort&quot;. Among them was the family of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The city was fully under the control of Jewish paramilitary forces by May 11, 1948.

Early in June, Jewish dignitaries from Safed journeyed to Tel Aviv to ask the government to block the return of Arabs to the city, threatening to abandon it if the latter were allowed back. They reasoned that since most of the Arabs&#x27; property had been seized or stolen in the meantime, the Jewish community would be unable to withstand the pressure of the returnees&#x27; demands for restitution.

===State of Israel===
In 1974, 25 Israeli Jews (mainly school children) from Safed, were killed in the Ma&#x27;alot massacre. Over 1990s and early 2000s, the town accepted thousands of Russian Jewish immigrants and Ethiopian Beta Israel. In July 2006, &quot;Katyusha&quot; rockets fired by Hezbollah from Southern Lebanon hit Safed, killing one man and injuring others. Many residents fled the town for the duration of the conflict. On July 22, four people were injured in a rocket attack.

The town has retained its unique status as a Jewish studies centre, incorporating numerous facilities. In 2010, eighteen senior rabbis led by the chief rabbi of Safed, Shmuel Eliyahu, issued an edict urging the city&#x27;s residents not to rent or sell property to Arabs, warning of an &quot;Arab takeover&quot;; Arabs constitute a fractional proportion of the population, and the statement was generally perceived to be directed at the 1,300 Arab students enrolled at Zefat Academic College.

For the 2011–2012 school year, the college began a program designed specifically for Haredi Judaism. It was created in order to allow haredi women living in the Upper Galilee access to higher education, while still maintaining strict religious practice. The program accomplishes this goal through separate classes for male and female students. The classes are also taught during certain hours as to allow women to fulfill other aspects of their religiosity.

==Historic sites==

;Citadel Hill
The Citadel Hill, in Hebrew HaMetzuda, rises east of the Old City and is named after the huge Crusader and then Mamluk castle built there during the 12th and 13th centuries, which continued in use until being totally destroyed by the 1837 earthquake. Its ruins are still visible. On the western slope beneath the ruins stands the former British police station, still pockmarked by bullet holes from the 1948 war.

;Old Jewish Quarter
Before 1948, most of Safed&#x27;s Jewish population used to live in the northern section of the old city. Currently home to 32 synagogues, it is also referred to as the synagogue quarter and includes synagogues named after prominent rabbis of the town: the Abuhav, Alsheich, Karo and two named for Rabbi Isaac Luria: one Ashkenazi, the other Sephardi.

;Mamluk-period buildings
Further south are two monumental Mamluk-period buildings:
* the Red Mosque with a khan (1276)
* the Mamluk mausoleum, now used by freemasons. The mausoleum was built for a Mamluk &quot;na&#x27;ib&quot; (governor) of Safed, Muzaffar ad-Din Musa ibn Hajj al-Ruqtay Musa Muzaffar al-Din ibn Ruqtay al-Hajj, who died in AH 762/AD 1360–61).

Southeast of the Artists&#x27; Quarter is the Saraya, the fortified governor&#x27;s residence built by Zahir al-Umar (1689/90–1775).

A report about the &quot;obliteration of non-Jewish historic sites in Safed&quot; mentions a mausoleum, an ancient grave and an ancient mosque that was converted into a clubhouse.

<text>Qalansawe or Qalansuwa (, , lit. &quot;turban&quot;) is an Arab city in the Central District of Israel. Part of the Triangle, in it had a population of .

==History==

===Early Muslim period===
During the Abbasid Revolution in 750, which toppled the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous members of the Umayyad dynasty were deported to Qalansawe from Egypt for execution, including descendants of caliphs Umar II () and Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (). Yaqut, a 13th-century scholar, wrote that &quot;many of the Omayyads were slain there.&quot; From the ninth century until the Crusader period, Qalansawe was a stop on the Cairo-Damascus road, between Lajjun and Ramla.

===Crusader and Mamluk periods===
During the Crusader period, the village was known as &quot;Calanson&quot;, &quot;Calansue&quot;, &quot;Calanzon&quot; or &quot;Kalensue&quot;. In 1128, it was given to the Hospitallers by the knight Godfrey of Flujeac. Yaqut (d. 1229) wrote that Qalansawe, Castle of the Plains, of the Crusaders, was a fortress near Ramle. Remnants of a crusader fortress remain today. It remained in Hospitallers hands (except for 1187–1191) until Baybars took it in 1265. However, during this period the lord of Caesarea appears to have retained overlordship.

In 1265, after the Mamluks had defeated the Crusaders, Qalansawe was mentioned among the estates which Sultan Baibars granted his followers. It was divided equally between two of his emirs: Izz al-Din Aidamur al-Halabi al-Salihi and Shams al-Din Sunqur al-Rumi al-Salihi.

===Ottoman period===
In 1517, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. In the 1596 tax-records it appeared located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Bani Sa&#x27;b of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Nablus. It had a population of 29 Muslim households. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats or beehives, and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 11,342 akçe.

Pierre Jacotin called the village &quot;Qalensawi&quot; on his map from 1799.

====19th-century explorers====
In 1870, the French explorer Victor Guérin found it to have 500 inhabitants. He then examined the remains of a church facing east and west, and divided into three naves, terminating to the east in three apses. It was constructed of cut stones, some of them slightly embossed. The naves were separated one from the other by monolithic columns and probably crowned by Corinthian capitals. One of them, of white marble, was repurposed by a villager who took it from the site of the church. The rest of the capitals and shafts were missing. An elegant door with a pointed arch was still standing. Under the nave ran a vaulted crypt, now divided into several compartments, which served as a shelter for several families. Ancient walls were found near the church and below the village. One was surmounted by a vaulted arcade in cut stones.

In the 1860s, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat Umm Ulayqa, or Ghabat Qalansuwa, in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.

In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as being of moderate size, and the seat of a Caimacam. In the centre of the village was a Crusader tower and hall, surrounded by the village houses, mostly made of adobe. Wells and a spring to the west supplied water.

=== British Mandate ===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qualansawe had a population of 871 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 1069, still all Muslim, in a total of 225 houses.

By the 1945 statistics, the village had 1540 Muslim inhabitants, who owned a total of owned 17,249 dunams of land. 473 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 759 plantations and irrigable land, 15,936 for cereals, while 47 dunams were built-up (urban) land.


===Israel===
==== 20th century ====
During the 1948 Palestine war, Jewish forces had planned to attack Qalansawe but the plan was not carried out. Qalansawe came under Israeli sovereignty in May 1949 as part of the Israel-Jordan armistice agreement. Political considerations then prevented the expulsion of the villagers.

In 1955 the village achieved local council status. In 1957 it was connected to running water. By 1962, land ownership had dropped to 6,620 dunams, mostly due to expropriation of land by the Israeli government in 1953–1954.

====21st century ====
In 2000 Qalansawe was declared a city.
In January 2017, the Israeli government demolished 11 buildings built by 4 families, on the grounds that they were built without permits. The families claimed they were given two days notice, which was insufficient for a legal response. The mayor of Qalansawe, announcing his resignation, said that he had fought for years to widen the town&#x27;s urban building plan without success, which is why the residents built on agricultural land. Thousands of people rallied in support of the village and a one-day strike was called.

==Demographics==
In 2001, the ethnic makeup of the city was virtually all Arab Muslims without significant Jewish population. There were 7,700 males and 7,300 females. 53.2% of the residents were 19 years of age or younger, 17.1% were between 20 and 29, 17.9% between 30 and 44, 8.0% from 45 to 59, 1.6% from 60 to 64, and 2.2% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 3.5%.

<text>Kiryat Ono () is a city in the Tel Aviv District of Israel. It is located east of Tel Aviv. In it had a population of .

Modern Kiryat Ono is adjacent to the biblical Ono, which was located in what is now the area of Or Yehuda. The city also took its name from the Palestinian village of Kafr &#x27;Ana, which took its name from Ono, a biblical town of Benjamin.

==History==

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the area of Kiryat Ono belonged to the Nahiyeh (sub-district) of Lod that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut in the south to the present-day city of El&#x27;ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land.

A settlement named Kfar Ono was established in 1939. During the 1950s, a ma&#x27;abara (transit camp for new immigrants in Israel) was established nearby. In 1954, the settlement merged with other communities to form Kiryat Ono. It achieved city status in 1992.

In a park, a lone sycamore tree stands on a hill overlooking the Tel HaShomer base; this tree has been adopted as the city&#x27;s spiritual and cultural icon. The lands surrounding the tree were owned as agricultural land and maintained by Aryeh Konikov. When the lone tree was planted, it seemed unique in its location, and Mr. Konikov nourished it and maintained the land surrounding it for many years. That land has now become a part of a park named Ricefield.

==Demographics==

<text>Kiryat Ata () also spelled Qiryat Ata, is a city in the Haifa District of Israel. In it had a population of , 92% of whom were Jewish citizens.

== History == 
The Early Bronze Age site at Kiryat Ata has been extensively excavated since 1990, revealing stratified remains from the Neolithic, EB (=early Bronze Age), IB and EB II periods. At &quot;Tell el ‘Idham&quot; remains from a continuous habitation from the early Bronze Age, through the Persian age down to the Roman era have been identified.

Archaeologists Mordechai Aviam and Dan Barag (1935–2009) thought it to be the &quot;Capharatha&quot; () mentioned by Josephus in the Lower Galilee, one of several views tentatively identified for the site.

Rock-hewn winepresses dating to the Byzantine era have been found here. Some have had crosses and Greek letters incised, supporting the theory that there was a Byzantine monastery located in the area. Ceramics from the Byzantine era have also been found here, and a building from the Byzantine or early Islamic period has been excavated.

In 1283 it was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders, according to the hudna between the Crusaders and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun. At the time it was called &quot;Kafrata&quot;. Ceramics from the Mamluk era have also been found here. An excavation at &quot;Independence Street&quot;, Kiryat Ata, showed nearly continuous settlement dating from the Persian and Hellenistic eras up to the Mamluk era (late eleventh–early fifteenth century CE).

===Ottoman era===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, &quot;Kufrata&quot; appeared in the census of 1596, located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Acca, part of Safad Sanjak. The population was 15 households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 1,508 akçe.

The village appeared under the name of &quot;Koufour Tai&quot; on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799, while in 1856 it was named &quot;Kefr Ette&quot; on Kiepert&#x27;s map of Palestine published that year.

In 1859 the population was estimated to be 100, and the cultivation was 16 feddans. In 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and found the village to have 50 houses.

In 1881 the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described &quot;Kefr Etta&quot; as &quot;a small adobe village, on the plain, with a well on the north and olives on the east.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Kh. Kefr Etta&quot; had about 285 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Kufritta&quot; showed a population of 400; 7 Christians and 393 Muslims, where all the Christians were of the Orthodox faith.

The area was acquired by the Jewish community as part of the Sursock Purchase. In 1925 a Zionist organisation purchased 10,000 dunums from Alexander Sursock, of the Sursock family of Beirut. At the time, there were 75 families living there.

In the 1931 census &quot;Kufritta&quot; had a population of 4 Muslims and 29 Jews, in a total of 13 occupied houses.

In 1934, one of the country&#x27;s largest textile plants, ATA, was established there.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Kfar Atta (Kufritta) consisted of 1,690 Jews and the land area was 6,131 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 6 dunams were designated for citrus and bananas, 39 dunams for plantations and irrigable land, 1,527 for cereals, while 3,591 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

===Kiryat Ata===

In the early 20th century, the lands of the Arab village of Kefr Etta were purchased by a Warsaw religious foundation named &quot;Avodat Israel&quot; through intermediaries in the American Zion Commonwealth. Avodat Israel founded Ata in 1925. During the 1929 Arab riots the town was attacked and abandoned. A year later the residents returned and rebuilt the community. The town was renamed Kfar Ata in 1940, which was also the name of the local textile factory. In 1965, when the village was merged with adjacent Kiryat Binyamin, the name became Kiryat Ata.

==Climate==

<text>James Lee Witt (born January 6, 1944) is a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), during the tenure of U.S. President Bill Clinton and is often credited with raising the agency&#x27;s level of professionalism and ability to respond to disasters.

==Early life==
Witt was born in Paris, Arkansas, and was raised in Dardanelle, in Yell County, Arkansas. He and Clinton met as boys in Little League. He founded a construction business in 1968. At 34, he was elected County Judge of Yell County. Witt was re-elected to the post six times and was recognized by the National Association of Counties for his work. Witt was a charter Board Chairman of Child Development Inc., which works to advance Head Start programs.

==Government career==
In 1988, shortly after being reelected county Judge, an administrative position he had held for ten years, Witt was appointed by then-Governor Bill Clinton to be the head of the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services. There he reorganized the state&#x27;s emergency management process. Clinton subsequently moved the new Fire Protection Services Program to OES, including the board and the grant program, which was administered in conjunction with the state Insurance Department.&quot;

When Clinton was elected president, he appointed Witt to head FEMA, for which Witt was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1993. In 1996, FEMA was given cabinet rank.

During his tenure Witt was able to overcome FEMA&#x27;s previously poor reputation. A 1992 interim report by the Congress (prior to Hurricane Andrew, which led to further criticism of FEMA) had said, &quot;FEMA is widely viewed as a political dumping ground, a turkey farm, if you will, where large numbers of positions exist that can be conveniently and quietly filled by political appointment ...&quot; The comment had been provoked by the appointment of Wallace Stickney, described in the report as &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;uninterested in the substantive programs of FEMA&quot; owing his post to his relationship with former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.

By 1996, an &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; editorial said, &quot;FEMA has developed a sterling reputation for delivering disaster-relief services, a far cry from its abysmal standing before James Lee Witt took its helm in 1993. How did Witt turn FEMA around so quickly? Well, he is the first director of the agency to have emergency-management experience. He stopped the staffing of the agency by political patronage. He removed layers of bureaucracy. Most important, he instilled in the agency a spirit of preparedness, of service to the customer, of willingness to listen to ideas of local and state officials to make the system work better.&quot;

Witt&#x27;s eight-year term in office saw approximately 348 Presidentially declared disaster areas in more than 6,500 counties and in all 50 states and the U.S. territories. Witt supervised the response to the 1997 Red River flood— a devastating flood in the Dakotas—the most costly earthquake, and a dozen serious hurricanes.

==Post-FEMA management and consulting==
On September 3, 2005, he was hired by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco to oversee reconstruction efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In December 2005, the University of Texas System hired his firm to prepare, process, and recover claims for damages from FEMA related to natural disasters. Witt served as CEO of the International Code Council, which sets international standards for building construction, 2003-06.

By August 2007, Witt was serving on the management team of Global Options Group LLC and as President of James Lee Witt Associates LLC, which provided consulting on emergency and disaster preparedness to local and state governments. In 2013, the firm merged with O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Response Management to become Witt|O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, with Witt as Executive Board Chair. In 2015, it was acquired by SEACOR.

In 2016, Witt formed Witt Global Partners, a Little Rock-based Government Relations and Disaster Consulting Firm. Witt is the CEO and Managing Partner of the firm.

==Electoral career==
Witt was mentioned as a potential candidate for Governor of Arkansas in 1997 but took himself out of consideration and stayed at FEMA until he was replaced by Joe Allbaugh, the first appointee of President George W. Bush. Witt announced in October 2013 that he expected to run for Congress in 2014 in Arkansas&#x27;s 4th congressional district. On November 4, 2014 Witt lost the race to GOP candidate Bruce Westerman 53.7-42.6%.

==History==
In 1924, Ephraim and Sabina Katz, who had immigrated to Mandatory Palestine from the Kingdom of Romania, were the first Jews in modern times to settle in the Zevulun Valley along the Haifa Bay. Their farm was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots. The one house that survived the riots, Beit Katz, was bequeathed to Kiryat Bialik in 1959 and designated for public use.

The town of Kiryat Bialik was founded in July 1934 by a group of German Jewish immigrants who had received a plot of land from the Jewish National Fund. The residents were mainly free professionals, doctors, engineers and lawyers who lived in private homes with gardens. During World War II, Kiryat Bialik was bombed due to its proximity to the oil refineries in Haifa.
In 1950, it was declared a local council, attaining city status in 1976.

During the Second Lebanon War, several rockets landed in the city, causing property damage and injuring a number of residents.

On September 22, 2024, during a fourth wave of rocket fire from Hezbollah, Kiryat Bialik was hit by rockets, injuring three people and damaging two houses. Magen David Adom (MDA) reported that two men, both in their 70s, and a 16-year-old girl were wounded by shrapnel.

<doc id="323357" wikidata="Q152406" url="?curid=323357" title="Kiryat Gat">
<text>Kiryat Gat () also spelled Qiryat Gat, is a city in the Southern District of Israel. It lies south of Tel Aviv, north of Beersheba, and west southwest of Jerusalem. In it had a population of . The city hosts one of the most advanced semiconductor fabrication plants in the world, Intel&#x27;s Fab 28 plant producing 7 nm process chips.

==Etymology==
Kiryat Gat was mistakenly named for Gath, one of the five major cities of the Philistines. In Hebrew, &quot;gat&quot; means &quot;winepress&quot;. In the 1950s, archaeologists found ruins at a nearby tell named Tel Erani and identified it as the Philistine city of Gath. Later archeologists proved this to be incorrect, but not before Kiryat Gat had been named in 1954. It proved too difficult to subsequently change the city’s name. This event cooled earlier enthusiasm for restoring biblical names more widely across the region. 

The location most favored for Gath now is Tel es-Safi, thirteen kilometers () to the northeast.

==History==

Kiryat Gat was founded in 1954, initially as a ma&#x27;abara. The following year it was established as a development town by 18 families from Morocco. It was founded just west of the ruins of the Palestinian Arab village of Iraq al-Manshiyya The former location of Iraq al-Manshiyya is now within the built-up area of Kiryat Gat. By 1992, Kiryat Gat had grown and spread also onto the land that formerly belonged to the village of Al-Faluja.

The population of Kiryat Gat rose from 4,400 inhabitants in 1958 to 17,000 in 1969, mostly Jewish immigrants from North Africa. The economy was initially based on processing the agricultural produce of the Lachish region, such as cotton and wool. In December 1972, Kiryat Gat&#x27;s municipal status was upgraded and it became Israel&#x27;s 31st city.

During the 1990s, the mass immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel brought many new residents to the town and its population grew to 42,500 by 1995. The development of the Rabin industrial zone on the eastern edge of the city, and the opening of Highway 6 further improved the economy of the city.

In 2012, the ethnic makeup of the city was 93.8 percent Jewish. In its early years, Kiryat Gat was populated mainly by Jews of Sephardi/Mizrahi origin. Since the mass immigration of Soviet Jews, approximately one third of the inhabitants hail from the former Soviet Union.

== Economy ==

The Polgat textile factory was the main employer in the town until it closed in the 1990s. In 1999, Intel opened a chip fabrication plant, known as Fab 18, to produce Pentium 4 chips and flash memories. Intel received a grant of $525 million from the Israeli government to build the plant. In February 2006, the cornerstone was laid for Intel&#x27;s second Kiryat Gat plant, Fab 28. Despite this, Kiryat Gat has one of Israel&#x27;s highest unemployment rates. In 2021, Intel announced a $10 billion investment in new manufacturing in Kiryat Gat.

The headquarters and small-arms (guns) manufacturing facility of Israeli Weapons Industries is now located in Kiryat Gat.

== Transportation ==
Kiryat Gat is served by the Kiryat Gat Railway Station on the Tel Aviv - Be&#x27;er Sheva inter-city line of Israel Railways. Kiryat Gat is situated between two major highways, Highway 40 to the west of the town and Highway 6.

<doc id="323358" wikidata="Q152567" url="?curid=323358" title="Kiryat Motzkin">
<text>Kiryat Motzkin () is a city in the Haifa District of Israel, north of the city center of Haifa. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, in it had a population of . However, as of September 2024, the unofficial population count is 55,600, reflecting significant growth not yet captured in official statistics. The city is named after Leo Motzkin (1867-1933), one of the organizers of the First Zionist Congress in 1897. The mayor of the city is Tziki Tzvi Avisar.
==History==

Kiryat Motzkin was founded in 1934, and by 1935 the first school was opened. In 1939, the town had a population of about 2,000 and 345 buildings. Kiryat Motzkin railway station was constructed by British Mandatory Palestine in 1937.
In the Second World War, Kiryat Motzkin suffered from German\Italian air bombarding.
It received local council status in 1940.
During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, an important battle took place near Kiryat Motzkin when the Haganah destroyed an Arab arms convoy and killed the commander of Arab forces in the process. This contributed to the Jewish victory in the Battle of Haifa.
==Demographics==
Kiryat Motzkin has experienced significant immigration waves throughout its history, contributing to its diverse population. Approximately 40% of the city&#x27;s residents are immigrants from the former Soviet Union or their descendants, significantly influencing the city&#x27;s cultural landscape.
According to the Israeli Interior Ministry, in 2024 the ethnic makeup of the city was predominantly Jewish and other non-Arabs. There were 25,000 males and 28,000 females, with 25.5% of the population 19 years of age or younger, 15.2% between 20 and 29, 19.0% between 30 and 44, 20.1% from 45 to 59, 4.5% from 60 to 64, and 15.9% 65 years of age or older.
The city has been experiencing positive migration, with more people moving in than out. This trend is attributed to the city&#x27;s reputation as a safe, quiet, and comfortable place to live.
The socio-economic status of Kiryat Motzkin&#x27;s residents is considered high within the Haifa metropolitan area. On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the highest), the city&#x27;s population ranks 7, indicating a relatively affluent community.

==Urban Development==
Kiryat Motzkin has exhausted its land reserves for new construction. As a result, the city&#x27;s urban future lies in urban renewal projects. These projects aim to modernize and densify existing neighborhoods while maintaining the city&#x27;s character as a comfortable suburban area.

<text>Kiryat Malakhi () also spelled Kiryat Malahi, Kiryat Malachi, or Qiryat Mal&#x27;akhi, is a city in the Southern District of Israel, northeast of Ashkelon. In it had a population of . Its jurisdiction is 4,632 dunams (~4.6 km2).

==History==

=== Qastina ===
Before the establishment of Kiryat Malakhi, the Palestinian village of Qastina stood at this location. Qastina&#x27;s population in 1945 was 890, and its economy was largely agricultural, with its people growing citrus groves and cereals. Furthermore, an elementary school for boys was established in Qastina in 1936, and by 1945 had an enrollment of 145 students. Students from the nearby Palestinian village of Tall al-Turmus also used to attend this school. Qastina also had one mosque.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, on July 9th, 1948, Qastina was assaulted by the Giv&#x27;ati Brigade. Today, only debris remains where the village once stood.

=== Establishment of Kiryat Malakhi ===
Kiryat Malakhi was established in 1951 as a ma&#x27;abara ( &#x27;temporary residential&#x27;), to house the masses of Jewish settlers who have arrived during the early years of the newly established State of Israel, many of them part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. The name was chosen to honor the Jewish community of Los Angeles, which contributed much of the funding for its establishment. It has been one of several development towns of the Negev desert, at that time being.

Moshe Katsav, later Israel&#x27;s 8th president, was elected mayor in 1969, at the age of 24. His younger brother Lior Katsav has also been a mayor of Kiryat Malachi; whilst Yosef Vanunu held the post from 1981 until the 1990s. The current mayor is Eliyahu &quot;Lalo&quot; Zohar.

On 15 November 2012 missile attacks were launched by Palestinian militant groups from the Gaza Strip as a response to Israel&#x27;s Operation Pillar of Defense. These attacks resulted in the deaths of three residents of the city.

==Demographics==

The arrival of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union as well as from Ethiopia in a few previous decades, has increased the population of Kiryat Malakhi by 40 percent. Some 22,000 people now reside in the city. In January 2012, Israeli television publicized a case of a seller in the municipality creating a restrictive covenant barring the sale or lease of property to Ethiopian Jews. The case led to public outcry and demonstrations of hundreds of people, and caused the Association for Civil Rights in Israel to call on the Registrar of Real Estate to revoke the licence of real estate agents who practice such discrimination. At the south end of the city, a Chabad neighborhood, Nachalat Har Chabad, is home to 2800 residents. A expansion of that neighborhood called Karmei HaNadiv is developing, with many high-rises being built to accommodate the growing Chabad population.

==Sports==
There is a 1,000-seat football (soccer) stadium named Teddy Arena, being held as the home-grounds for the local association club of Maccabi Kiryat Malachi.

==Transportation==

The city&#x27;s main transportation hub is the Malakhi Junction (also known as Qastina).

==Education==
According to CBS, there are 15 schools and 4,909 students in the city. They are spread out as 10 elementary schools and 2,867 elementary school students, and 2 high schools and 2,042 high school students.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Kiryat Malakhi is twinned with:

* Piatra Neamț, Romania
* Rueil-Malmaison, France (&quot;since 1985&quot;)
* Golmud, China

<doc id="323366" wikidata="Q1584908" url="?curid=323366" title="Invasion of the Dinosaurs">
<text>Invasion of the Dinosaurs, simply titled Invasion in Part One, is the second serial of the 11th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 12 January to 16 February 1974.

Set in London, the serial involves Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Charles Grover (Noel Johnson) and General Finch (John Bennett) conspiring to roll the Earth back in time to the &quot;golden age&quot; when it was untouched by humanity. This is the last story from the Pertwee era to contain an episode that was colourised from a black-and-white telerecording after the original colour version was irretrievably lost.

==Plot==
The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive in a deserted London, where they discover that dinosaurs are inexplicably appearing all over the city, causing havoc, but no one can account for their sudden appearances and disappearances.

The Doctor suspects that someone is deliberately tampering with time and with the help of his colleagues at UNIT, he starts to formulate a plan. They are introduced to Sir Charles Grover MP, and General Finch. In a hidden laboratory, Professor Whitaker is operating secret Timescoop technology. The dinosaurs are being used to compel the authorities to evacuate the city. It turns out that Whitaker is being aided by the disillusioned Captain Yates, of UNIT.

Sarah conducts her own investigations, but is captured by Grover, who is in league with Whitaker. She awakens and is astounded to find herself on a vast spaceship. The crew explain that they are en route to a distant Earth-like planet, explaining that Mankind can begin again on &quot;New Earth&quot;, closer to nature and without the overpopulation and pollution of Earth. When Sarah tries to explain that they are still on Earth, they condemn Sarah to be re-educated into thinking the way they do.

Operation Golden Age is revealed to be a broad conspiracy, including Yates, with Whitaker, Grover and Finch as its coordinators. They have emptied London, so that the chosen people on the &quot;spacecraft&quot; (a dummy ship hidden in a bunker under London) will be the only people within range of the Timescoop when it is activated. Whitaker has discovered how to reverse time, so that only the chosen elite will ever have existed.

Meanwhile, Sarah escapes from the bunker, but is apprehended by Finch. Her escape alerts some of the passengers to the deception. Yates reveals their plans to the Doctor, Benton and the Brigadier. Yates is overpowered, and when Finch tries to stop the Doctor&#x27;s and the Brigadier&#x27;s efforts, Benton incapacitates him in a struggle.

The Doctor and the Brigadier confront Grover and Whitaker, just as the duped environmentalists from the fake ship arrive and demand an explanation. The Timescoop is activated, but, as the Doctor is a Time Lord, the machine&#x27;s effect on him is limited, allowing him to switch the device off. Finch is arrested and court martialled. Grover tries to use the machine again – but, as the Doctor has reversed its polarity, it sends only itself, Whitaker and Grover into the past.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;Bridgehead from Space&quot; and &quot;Timescoop&quot;. The story title of the first episode was contracted to &quot;Invasion&quot; in the opening title sequence, in an attempt to conceal the central plot device of dinosaurs. However, this was undermined by the BBC listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;, which carried a picture of a dinosaur in the listing for episode one.

Malcolm Hulke protested against the use of the title &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;, preferring the original working title of &quot;Timescoop&quot;, and felt the contraction for the first episode was silly, especially because the &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave the game away. In a response letter after transmission, script editor Terrance Dicks pointed out that all the titles used for the project had originated in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production office. He agreed that the contraction to &quot;Invasion&quot; was a decision he now regretted but noted that &quot;&quot;Radio Times&quot; are a law unto themselves&quot;.

In the novelisation, adapted by Malcolm Hulke from his own scripts, no reference is made to the &quot;Whomobile&quot; (which was a prop contributed to the production at a late stage by actor Jon Pertwee). In the novel, the Doctor uses a military motorbike with electronic scanning equipment attached, as in the original scripts.

Locations used in London included Moorgate underground station, Smithfield Market, Westminster Bridge, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Haymarket, Covent Garden, Southall and Wimbledon Common. Location filming took place in September 1973, with studio recording commencing in October and November.

The producer of the series, Barry Letts, was very disappointed with the realisation of the dinosaurs, and stated in an interview in 2004 that this was the story he would most like to remake with modern technology.

===Missing episodes and archive===
All episodes of this story except Part One exist on original format PAL colour master tapes, with the first episode only existing as a monochrome 16mm film print, but has since been recolourised. It was returned to the BBC by Ian Levine in June 1983 after being retained by him for two years for use as a bargaining chip, in case another, more valuable, missing episode showed up. A short clip from the end of Episode One, depicting the Doctor and Sarah Jane in the back of a Land Rover to be taken to the detention centre when the Land Rover encounters a tyrannosaurus rex, still survives in its original 625-line format, having been used as reprise at the beginning of Episode Two.

There is a long-standing fan myth that the tape of Part One was erased by mistake, having been confused with an episode of the Patrick Troughton serial &quot;The Invasion&quot;. In fact, BBC Enterprises issued specific instructions to wipe all six episodes of &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;, named as such, in August 1974, just six months after the story&#x27;s transmission; for reasons unknown, however, only Part One was actually wiped. Stickers on the cans for the remaining episodes 2–6 indicate that they were returned from BBC Wales, which was transmitting Season 11 in a different timeslot on Sunday. As far as the BBC was concerned, the story had been wiped in its entirety; researchers for the 1977 BBC documentary &quot;Whose Doctor Who&quot; found that none of the episodes were listed as existing in the BBC Film Library, despite the fact that episodes 2–6 were actually at the possession of the BBC engineering department (they would be merged together into the BBC Film and Videotape Library in 1978).

A black-and-white film print exists of the filmed sequences for Part One. This includes one scene of a scared scavenger stealing money from a dead milkman&#x27;s satchel that was omitted from the broadcast version; this would have formed part of the deserted London montage. Black-and-white prints were used for practice by BBC film editors, in deciding where to make cuts, before cutting the master colour negatives. The surviving film recording of Episode 1 is the only tele-recording of a Season 11 episode held in the archives; this is probably due to the longstanding practice within BBC Enterprises of making a film print for overseas sales purposes prior to wiping any master tape. Colour 35mm film sequences from Part Five also exist, as does the initial edit of Part Three, without sound effects or incidental music on the soundtrack (known within the BBC as a &quot;71 edit&quot;).

===Cast notes===
John Bennett later returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Li H&#x27;sen Chang in &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (1977). Peter Miles also appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in other roles in &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970) and &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975), and in the radio serial &quot;Paradise of Death&quot;. Martin Jarvis had earlier appeared as Hilio in &quot;The Web Planet&quot; (1965) and later appeared as the Governor of Varos in &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985). Carmen Silvera had previously appeared in &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot; (1966).

==Broadcast and reception==

After the episodes were broadcast, many younger viewers of the show complained that the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; was actually an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

The story was repeated in 1999 on BBC Choice as part of a series of programmes themed around dinosaurs.

In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1998), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping noted that &quot;the special effects are woeful&quot; and there was some padding, but the story &quot;has many redeeming features, most notably the sombre location footage in the first episode&quot;. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, in their analysis in &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot;, felt that unfortunately the &quot;awfulness of the dinosaur scenes tends to overshadow the excellence of Paddy Russell&#x27;s direction of the rest of the story and the high quality of the performances by the assembled cast&quot;. Though they were favourable towards the plot, they noted that &quot;the story is poorly paced and contains a tremendous amount of padding&quot;.

In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it three stars out of five, describing it as &quot;a roaringly good script&quot; and he also praised the casting, but he criticised the dinosaurs as &quot;dire&quot; and questioned the &quot;grand plan&quot; which &quot;raises all sorts of questions about how the new, jump-suited generation of mankind was smuggled aboard the fake spaceship, or how a big, nuclear-generator-powered underground base could be built unnoticed&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott gave the story four out of five stars. Aside from the dinosaurs, he felt that the rest was &quot;very good&quot; with &quot;a good amount of suspense, some nice twists&quot;, and also highlighted how the villains were &quot;people who basically had the right ideas but that they took it way too far&quot;. &quot;SFX&quot; reviewer Ian Berriman wrote that the serial was &quot;crammed with unlikely plot turns ... but that just makes it all the more entertaining&quot;. He noted that it was problematic to have several cliffhangers rely on the appearance of the dinosaurs due to their poor realisation, but praised Sarah&#x27;s competence and involvement with the plot.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in February 1976 as &quot;Doctor Who and the Dinosaur Invasion&quot;. In 1993 it was reprinted with the title &quot;Doctor Who – Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;, and different cover art. The novelisation features a prologue about the dinosaurs and ends with the Doctor consulting the Book of Ezekiel to determine the final fate of the Golden Age time travellers. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Martin Jarvis was released on CD in November 2007 by BBC Audiobooks.

===Home media===
This was the final complete story to be released by BBC Worldwide on VHS, in 2003.

The story was released on DVD in the UK on 9 January 2012 alongside the 1975 Tom Baker story &quot;The Android Invasion&quot;, together forming the U.N.I.T Files box set. The DVD features a restored black-and-white version of Episode 1 as the default and also a &#x27;best-endeavours&#x27; attempt at colour recovery of this episode as a branched-extra feature. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 121 on 21 August 2013.

In contrast to other wiped colour episodes from the Pertwee era where the missing colour information had been inadvertently recorded on the surviving black and white film copies as a sequence of visual artefacts/dots or chroma dots, in the case of Part One of this story this information was found to be incomplete, and only the red and green colour signal information was recoverable, requiring the missing blue signal information to be obtained via other means.

The new colour version of Part One featured on the DVD thus employs approximated blue colour information, and although the outcome is not up to normal DVD quality, it gives an impression of what the episode would have looked like when originally broadcast.

<text>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU; ) is a public research university located in the East District of Tainan, Taiwan. Founded in 1931 during Japanese rule as an engineering college, the university is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Taiwan. 

NCKU enrolls approximately 12,000 undergraduates and 10,000 postgraduate students, primarily in engineering, science, medicine, and design programs. The university is a founding member of the Taiwan Comprehensive University System, a strategic alliance of four leading research universities in the Southern Taiwan. The university is also a member of AACSB and IEET, and the only member from Taiwan in the Worldwide Universities Network. Its main campus in Tainan houses the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and the National Cheng Kung University Museum. 

In 2005, NCKU was chosen by the Ministry of Education (Taiwan) as one of the seven universities in Taiwan for the Aim for the Top University Project (), which is similar to Top Global University Project in Japan and Universities of Excellence in Germany. Starting from 2006, because of its academic performance and research potential, the Ministry of Education (Taiwan) has offered NCKU NT$1.7 billion annually for five consecutive years, which is the second highest amount received among the universities in the project.

== History ==
National Cheng Kung University was originally established under Japanese colonial government in January 1931 as the Tainan Technical College. After the Japanese handover of Taiwan in October 1945, the school was renamed Taiwan Provincial Tainan Junior College of Technology in March 1946, and then to Taiwan Provincial College of Engineering in October the same year.

When the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan in 1949, it was one of the three existing colleges in Taiwan. As the number of colleges expanded, it was upgraded to a provincial university in 1956 as Provincial Cheng Kung University, named after Koxinga, a Southern Ming military general who drove the Dutch East India Company from Taiwan and founded the Kingdom of Tungning. In 1971, the university became a national university and was renamed National Cheng Kung University.

Former Minister for Education Wu Jin served as the first president of the new National Cheng Kung University.

==Campuses==
NCKU is located in Tainan City, Taiwan. The main campus is situated across from the Tainan Railway Station, offering convenient transportation. NCKU has 11 campuses occupying a total of 187 hectares of land in the greater Tainan area, including the Cheng-Kung, Sheng-Li, Kuang-Fu, Cheng-Hsing, Tzu-Chiang, Ching-Yeh, Li-Hsing, Tung-Ning, Kuei-Jen, An-Nan and Dou-Liu campuses, and some areas designated for dormitory use.

On 12 January 2011, the Y. S. Sun Green Building Research Center was inaugurated. It is the world&#x27;s first green educational center as well as Taiwan&#x27;s first zero carbon building. The -facility cost NT$30 million (US$4.41 million) to construct, far below the original NT$180 million budget. Natural ventilation, limited power usage, reduced window size, and energy efficient lighting all contribute to the building&#x27;s carbon neutrality.

== Organization ==

NCKU comprises 9 colleges, 43 departments, and 39 institutes. NCKU is organized into 9 colleges, including Liberal Arts, Sciences, Management, Engineering, Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science, Social Science, Planning &amp; Design, Bioscience &amp; Biotechnology and Medicine, each with its own faculties, departments, and institutes offering programs up to doctoral level. The university currently offers 42 undergraduate programs, 74 master&#x27;s degree programs, 53 doctoral programs, and 17 master&#x27;s degree programs for working professionals. While most courses are taught in Mandarin Chinese, many are offered in English.

==International programs==
NCKU has 401 cooperation agreements with 251 institutions and universities across the world. Student exchange agreements have been signed with 98 foreign partner universities including University of Southern California, Technical University of Munich, Leiden University, the University of New South Wales, Kyoto University, Seoul National University, National University of Singapore, etc.

In 2018, KU Leuven and IMEC reached dual degree agreement with NCKU. During the same year, NCKU and Purdue University signed the agreement of collaboration for international dual degree program and online courses. TU Darmstadt launched its liaison office in Asia at NCKU on 21 May 2019.

NCKU participates in the Taiwan International Graduate Program in Interdisciplinary Neuroscience of Academia Sinica, the national academy of Taiwan.

== Rankings ==
NCKU is generally considered to be a top tier university in Taiwan, along with National Taiwan University, National Tsing Hua University, and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. In 2014, the Representative of Japan in Taiwan listed NCKU as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.

=== Overall ===
Globally, NCKU is 228th in QS WUR 2024, 601–800th in Times WUR 2023, 639th in U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings 2022-2023, 301–400th in ARWU 2022, and 218th in CWTS Leiden Ranking.

=== Subject/Area ===
According to QS World University Rankings by Subject in 2020, NCKU ranked within the world&#x27;s top 150 universities in the following fields: Civil and Structural Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Systems, Chemical Engineering, Engineering and Technology, Materials Sciences, Architecture, Statistics and Operational Research, Art and Design, and Environmental Studies. 

The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) ranked NCKU 76-100th in the engineering field in 2016 and 101-150th in computer science in 2015. 

According to the ESI database, NCKU has published 18,333 papers in the last ten years and has respectively ranked the 24th and the 51st in the list of world top 100 universities respectively in the engineering and computer science fields.

<text>Kiryat Shmona () is a city in the Northern District of Israel on the western slopes of the Hula Valley near the Lebanese border. The city was named after the eight Jews, including Joseph Trumpeldor, who died in 1920 in the Battle of Tel Hai.

In it had a population of . Located near the Israel–Lebanon border, Kiryat Shmona is Israel&#x27;s northernmost city.

==History==

Kiryat Shmona was established in 1949 on the site of the former Palestinian village Al-Khalisa, whose inhabitants had fled after Safed was taken by the Haganah during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and an attempt by the village to come to an agreement with the Jewish authorities was rejected. 

Literally the &quot;City of the Eight&quot;, Kiryat Shmona was named after eight Jewish militiamen, commanded by Joseph Trumpeldor, who had fallen in the 1920 Battle of Tel Hai during the Franco-Syrian War adjacent to the new town. It had originally been named &quot;Kiryat Yosef&quot; for Trumpeldor before the name was changed to Kiryat Shmona in June 1950.

Initially the empty houses of Al-Khalisa were used as a transit camp for Jewish immigrants and refugees who worked mainly in farming. The first residents were fourteen Yemenite Jews who arrived on July 18, 1949, and were followed by more Yemenite Jews a month later. By July 1951, the population had grown to nearly 4,000. Relationships with nearby kibbutzim were often strained.

In 1953, Kiryat Shmona was declared a development town. In the first few years, growth was driven by the arrival of immigrants from Romania, India, Iraq, and Iran, as well as Kurdish immigrants from the Iraqi and Iranian areas of Kurdistan. However, later on, waves of immigrants from North Africa, in particular from Morocco, arrived. The city was built without a master plan, but rather neighborhood by neighborhood as waves of immigrants arrived.

=== Security Incidents ===

Kiryat Shmona&#x27;s location in close proximity to the Lebanese border makes it a target for rocket fire cross-border attacks.

On April 11, 1974, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, sent three members across the border from Lebanon to Kiryat Shmona. They killed eighteen residents of an apartment building, including many children, before being killed in an exchange of fire at the complex, which became known as the Kiryat Shmona massacre.

The city continued to be the target of attacks, including Katyusha rocket attacks by the PLO in July 1981, a Katyusha rocket attack by the PLO in March 1986 (killing a teacher and injuring four students and one adult), and further Katyusha rocket attacks by Hezbollah during 1996&#x27;s Operation Grapes of Wrath.

On 24/25 June 1999 two residents were killed when Hezbollah fired a salvo of Katyusha rockets into the centre of Kiryat Shimona. They were the first fatalities in a cross border attack since 1995 and came during massive Israeli air strikes across Lebanon which caused $52 million damage and killed eleven Lebanese.

In spite of attacks from Lebanon, the population grew from 11,800 in 1972 to 15,100 in 1983.

In 2000–2006, the locals enjoyed relative peace but suffered from loud explosions every few weeks because of Hezbollah anti-aircraft cannons fired at IAF planes flying across the Israeli-Lebanese border.

==== During Israel&#x27;s wars ====
During the 2006 Lebanon War, the city was again the target of Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks. Most of the city&#x27;s residents left the area during the war, and the 5,000 who remained stayed in bomb shelters, turning the city into a ghost town. During the war, a total of 1,012 Katyusha rockets hit Kiryat Shmona.

In the beginning of the Israel–Hamas war in October 2023, the city was evacuated due to attacks by Hezbollah and Palestinian factions from Southern Lebanon. During the war, there were 129 siren alerts throughout the city: 13 in the first month of the war, 15 in the second month, and 18 in the third month.
The city was significantly damaged due to Hezbollah missile attacks, with the attacks causing damage to infrastructure and fires that have decimated the nearby area. Nearly all of Kiryat Shmona&#x27;s inhabitants were evacuated to other areas of Israel as part of the conflict, with about 2,000 residents remaining in the city as of July 2024. Hezbollah attacks damaged 383 buildings and killed two people. In the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and subsequent ceasefire, residents began to return.

==Geography==

Kiryat Shmona is located in the Finger of the Galilee next to Hula Valley, about south and east of the Israel–Lebanon border. Its elevation is about above sea level.

==Tourism==

The town has a cable car link with Manara above in the Naftali mountain range and also is home to an activity center and toboggan run located in the south of the town.

In the residential area there is an urban natural space called Park HaZahav. Zahav means &quot;gold&quot; in Hebrew; the park is named after the stream running through it, the Ein Zahav Stream. Park HaZahav covers 11 hectares in the middle of Kiryat Shmona. It comprises many diverse natural resources. In addition to intensive activity areas designated for leisure and play, and open to all, the park contains a diverse, protected, natural area comprising Ein Zahav Stream and HaTachanot Stream (Tachanot refers to two water mills [tachana=mill] which were active along this stream in the past), which flow through the middle of the park. These streams have created different aquatic habitats, including shallow sections, rapids, deep sections and pools that support diverse riparian vegetation that has developed with time into a riparian forest. This isn&#x27;t common in Israel. The park has a trail that goes through the forest and along the stream. Included in the park are different gardening initiatives by local volunteers, a picnic area, and a playground.

The town is home to one of the 14 Israel Tennis Centers (ITC). These Centers throughout Israel teach children life skills through tennis. The Centers are primarily funded through donations. The Israel Children&#x27;s Centers in the United States, and the Canada Israel Children&#x27;s Centres are largely responsible for the funding of the Tennis Centers, which strive to never turn a child away due to financial need.

==Transportation==

Kiryat Shmona is located at the junction of two major national highways, Highway 90 and Highway 99. Kiryat Shmona is located near the Northern terminus of the North-South Highway 90. Highway 90, &quot;Israel&#x27;s longest road&quot;, connects Eilat in the extreme south of the Country, running along Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea, running through the West Bank, to Kiryat Shmona in the northern extreme. The highway terminates about 8 km further north, at the Lebanese border at the town of Metula. Highway 99, Israel&#x27;s northern-most East-West Highway, starts from Kiryat Shmona and travels East, into the Golan. The highway passes through Banias, and connects to the Druze town of Mas&#x27;ade. The highway also serves an important tourist function, as it provides access for Israelis to winter sport facilities at the slopes of Mount Hermon.

The Egged Bus Company provides services along 26 inner city bus routes in Kiryat Shmona. Egged Bus Company, along with Nateev Express, connect Kiryat Shmona to the surrounding Jewish and Arab localities. &quot;Golan Public Transport&quot; connects Kiryat Shmona to Jewish and Syrian Arab localities in the occupied Golan Heights. Egged Bus Company also provides long-distance services to cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in the center of the country.

Currently, Kiryat Shmona is not served by Israel Railways or any other sort of rail transport. There is an approved project to extend the Acre-Karmiel passenger rail line to Safed and Kiryat Shmona. The finalized plan was submitted for review in June 2022. The rail line will connect Kiryat Shmona to Safed (Tzahar), Karmiel, Haifa, and further south to the economic and population core of the Country at Gush Dan (Greater Tel Aviv). The rail line project itself has been subject to criticism. One criticism involves accusation of discrimination in planning against Arab citizens of Israel, specifically that despite being a rail line in the Galilee, a region where more than half the population are Arab, no stations that will serve any of the Arab localities of the region is proposed. Same situation exists along the existing Acre-Karmiel portion of the line. Furthermore, residents of Arab villages along the path of the railway line, specifically residents of the village of Nahf, charge that the proposed route of the railway line to Kiryat Shmona will result either in confiscation, or in imposition of a construction ban on 10% of the land area of the village, a village that is overcrowded and has a limited development space as it is. In addition, there are also criticisms with respect to the proposed placement of Kiryat Shmona Train Station. The station is proposed to be located outside of the urban area of the city, along local road &quot;9779&quot;. A large parking space is proposed for the station as well. However, critics state that the location of the station will force the residents to either continue to rely on their private vehicles, or to the inconvenience of waiting for urban bus lines as opposed to simply walking.

<doc id="323371" wikidata="Q840692" url="?curid=323371" title="Pitch (resin)">
<text>Pitch is a viscoelastic polymer which can be natural or manufactured, derived from petroleum, coal tar, or plants. Pitch produced from petroleum may be called bitumen or asphalt, while plant-derived pitch, a resin, is known as rosin in its solid form. Tar is sometimes used interchangeably with pitch, but generally refers to a more liquid substance derived from coal production, including coal tar, or from plants, as in pine tar.

== Uses ==
Pitch, a traditional naval store, was traditionally used to help caulk the seams of wooden sailing vessels (see shipbuilding). Other important historic uses included coating earthenware vessels for the preservation of wine, waterproofing wooden containers, and making torches. It was also used to make patent fuel from coal slack around the turn of the 19th century. Petroleum-derived pitch is black in colour, hence the adjectival phrase, &quot;pitch-black&quot;.

The viscoelastic properties of pitch make it well suited for the polishing of high-quality optical lenses and mirrors. In use, the pitch is formed into a lap or polishing surface, which is charged with iron oxide (Jewelers&#x27; rouge) or cerium oxide. The surface to be polished is pressed into the pitch, then rubbed against the surface so formed. The ability of pitch to flow, albeit slowly, keeps it in constant uniform contact with the optical surface.

Chasers pitch is a combination of pitch and other substances, used in jewelry making.

== Viscoelastic properties ==
Naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen, a type of pitch, is a viscoelastic polymer. This means that even though it seems to be solid at room temperature and can be shattered with a hard impact, it is actually fluid and will flow over time, but extremely slowly. The pitch drop experiment taking place at University of Queensland is a long-term experiment which demonstrates the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. For the experiment, pitch was put in a glass funnel and allowed to slowly drip out. Since the pitch was allowed to start dripping in 1930, only nine drops have fallen. It was calculated in the 1980s that the pitch in the experiment has a viscosity approximately 100 billion (1011) times that of water. The eighth drop fell on 28 November 2000, and the ninth drop fell on 17 April 2014. Another experiment was started by a colleague of Nobel Prize winner Ernest Walton in the physics department of Trinity College in Ireland in 1944. Over the years, the pitch had produced several drops, but none had been recorded. On July 11, 2013, scientists at Trinity College caught pitch dripping from a funnel on camera for the first time.

Winchester College has a &#x27;pitch glacier&#x27; demonstration which has been running since 21 July 1906, but does not have records of regular measurements.

== Production ==
The heating (dry distilling) of wood causes tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birchbark is used to make birch-tar, a particularly fine tar. The terms tar and pitch are often used interchangeably. However, pitch is considered more solid, while tar is more liquid. Traditionally, pitch that was used for waterproofing buckets, barrels and ships was drawn from pine. It is used to make cutler&#x27;s resin.

A 10th-century redaction of an earlier Greek Byzantine agricultural work brings down the ancient method of applying pitch to ceramic wine casks:
[A wood-based pitch] is put into an earthen vessel, and it is put over a small fire in the sun, then some hot water percolated through wood-ashes is poured on it, and the pitch is stirred; when it has afterward stood, it is poured out after two hours, then there is as much water again poured in. Having therefore done this thrice every day for three days and having taken up the moisture on the surface, they make the pitch that is left exceedingly good. Dry pitch is also bitter, but being boiled with wine it becomes more useful; [...] and having boiled the mixture to a third part, they use it as properly qualified: but some throw wood-ashes into it and boil it down.&lt;br&gt; In Italy they use pitch of this kind: forty minæ of pitch, one of wax, eight drams of sal ammoniac, six drams of manna. Thus, having pounded them and boiled them together, they sprinkle eight ounces (&quot;uncia&quot;) of well-ground fenugreek over them and they pitch the cask with them when they are well mixed.

The ceramic ware was pitched, both inside and out, immediately while they were removed from the kiln and still hot.

==Literary references==
The ability of pitch to contaminate those in contact with it is mentioned by Dogberry, a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, and the same point is made in a speech by Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1, who refers to &quot;ancient writers&quot; who have made this observation. The Jewish deuterocanonical Book of Sirach states that &quot;whoever touches pitch gets dirty, and whoever associates with a proud person becomes like him&quot;.

<doc id="323373" wikidata="Q167617" url="?curid=323373" title="Rahat">
<text>Rahat (, ) is an Arab Bedouin city in the Southern District of Israel. In , it had a population of . As such, it is the largest Bedouin city in Israel, and the only one to have city status.

Rahat is one of seven Bedouin townships in the Negev desert with approved plans and developed infrastructure. The other six are Hura, Tel as-Sabi (Tel Sheva), Ar&#x27;arat an-Naqab (Ar&#x27;ara BaNegev), Lakiya, Kuseife (Kseife) and Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom).

==History==
The region of the city was formerly owned by Al-Tayaha tribe (Al-Hezeel clan). Until the year 1972 the town was called &quot;El Huzaiyil&quot; () before changing its name. In 1972 Rahat was considered by the government of Israel as a new settlement for Bedouin who lived in the surrounding area without permanent domicile. Until 1980, Rahat was part of the Bnei Shimon Regional Council and from then on (until 1994) it was a local council (administered by a private board until 1989). In 1994 it was recognized as a city – the first Bedouin city in Israel.

After the 7 October attacks in 2023, several Qassam Brigade militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated Rahat, located thirty kilometres from Gaza, representing the furthest extent of the incursions by Palestinian militants. Over a month after the attack, two militants were arrested in the city by Israeli police.

==Urban development==
The city has a total of 33 neighborhoods. All but one of the neighborhoods consist entirely of separate Bedouin clans, but one is a mixed-clan neighborhood. Between each neighborhood there is a wadi. The city also has a market, public and commercial services, neighborhood parks, public areas, women&#x27;s employment centers, children&#x27;s play areas, and several mosques.

==Climate==
Rahat has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). The average annual temperature is , and around of precipitation falls annually.
==Economy==
The township is situated close to Beersheva so its economy is related to that of the city. There is an industrial park in the suburbs of Rahat, and another new park was founded on 2015 called Idan HaNegev. Several more industrial parks are situated in the area - Beersheba and Hura. Residents also work in the services industry in Beersheba. There are several organizations that promote entrepreneurship among the 210,000 Bedouin living in the Negev, primarily aimed at Bedouin women. One of them is Maof, and another one focused on finding jobs is called Rian.

In 2005 the city was one of the first to be connected to the WiMAX network.

In 2007 the Center for Jewish-Arab economic development initiated an entrepreneurship and employment project for Rahat residents. Approximately 40 Bedouin women took part in it and received training in job search, computer skills and business management. Twelve of them have launched their own businesses (shops, clothing, hairdressing, restaurant and catering, sewing).

In 2009 the city was unable to pay its water fees and the water supply was disconnected for five hours. Today Rahat has a water company that is in charge of supplying water and taking care of the sewers.

In 2006 Rahat collected 59% of Arnona taxes, making it the Arab city with the highest tax collection rate for the Arabic population for that year. In 2012 Rahat increased tax collection to 71%. In 2013 Rahat was collecting tax from its residents and also got 44% of a nearby industrial park.
In 2014 the city’s unemployment rate was 34%, dropping to 14% in 2017. The improvement has been attributed to a new industrial park, Idan HaNegev.

==Culture projects==

There are a number of organizations carrying out different activities aimed at supporting and facilitating entrepreneurship in Israel&#x27;s South in order to further integrate the 210,000 Bedouin living in the Negev into Israel&#x27;s mainstream economy. They are primarily aimed at Bedouin women.

Twenty Arab-Bedouin women from the towns of Rahat, Lakiya, Tel Sheva, Segev Shalom, Kuseife and Rachma participated in a sewing course for fashion design at the Amal College in Beer Sheva, including lessons on sewing and cutting, personal empowerment and business initiatives.

There is a volunteer program to teach English to the Bedouin schoolchildren of Rahat.

Social and Environmental Leadership Program was established in Rahat in the mid-2000s, initiated by young local residents.

==Education==

Since the city of Beersheva is in close proximity to Rahat, most Bedouin students from Rahat study at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, some also at Sapir Academic College in Sderot. Soon a new Harvard University campus will be established in Rahat - inside Idan HaNegev Industrial Park. It will be the first campus built in this Bedouin city. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev will oversee the new campus&#x27; operations, and it will be considered a BGU branch.

==Health and public services==

Rahat as a city has a number of public services, including medical services, schooling, labor, shopping, etc. There are branches of several health funds (medical clinics) in Rahat: Leumit, Clalit, Maccabi and several perinatal (baby care) centers Tipat Halav. In 2004 a new police station was opened, and has around 70 staff policemen. There is a community center in Rahat with a number of clubs for youth.

==Demographics==

According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2001 the ethnic make-up of the city was almost completely Arab Bedouin, without a significant Jewish population (&quot;see also:&quot; Population groups in Israel), making it the largest Bedouin settlement in Israel. Rahat&#x27;s society is considered a young one, as more than half of its residents are under the age of 18.

Members of several Bedouin family clans reside in Rahat:

*Al-Tarabin: The ancient inhabitants of the Negev, their name Tarabin came the ancient Arabic name of the Negev region (Turban, تربان).
*Al-Tayaha: The ancient inhabitants of Sinai, The word Al-Tiyaha means &quot;the lost ones&quot; in Arabic, their original home was the Al-Tih plateau in central of Sinai.
*Al-Azazma: along with Al-Tayaha and Al-Tarabin are thought to be the indigenous pre-Islamic bedouins of Negev and Sinai. Probably related to ancient Arabians who inhabited the area like the Nabateans.
*Al-Howeitat: from northwestern Arabia.
*Al-Shorbagy: from Turkish Anatolian roots.
*Al-Qrenawi: Turkish Anatolian-Arab tribal confederation originally from the city of Al-Qurein of Egypt.
*Al-Tawarah: tribal confederation originally from the Al-Tur region in Sinai.

According to the CBS, in 2001 there were 16,300 males and 16,100 females. The population of the city was spread out, with 65.2% 19 years of age or younger, 15.8% between 20 and 29, 12.0% between 30 and 44, 4.7% from 45 to 59, 0.9% from 60 to 64, and 1.4% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 5.9%. Also according to the CBS, at the end of 2010 there were 26,700 males and 26,400 females. Some 60.4% of Rahat&#x27;s population were 19 years old or younger, 15.4% between 20 and 29, 15.3% between 30 and 44, 5.9% from 45 to 59, 1% from 60 to 64, and 2% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate has decreased significantly to 2.7%.

According to city&#x27;s mayor the city is home to an estimated 7,000 illegal immigrants at any given time.

==Tourism==
Rahat is known to be a center of authentic food tourism. The city receives many tourists from Israel and from abroad, especially during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Most of the tourists like to be hosted in houses around Rahat where the lady owner of the house cooks traditional Bedouin food and tells stories about the Bedouin culture.

==Transportation==
In June 2007 a new Lehavim-Rahat Railway Station was opened. It serves both the Bedouin community of Rahat and the suburbs of Lehavim. It made it more accessible for the local residents to work and study in Beer Sheba and other parts of the country. There are buses operated by the Galim and Dan BaDarom bus companies. For a long period of time there were only private transit buses in the city, but in 2009 the bus transportation system was substantially improved and larger, national bus companies started to enter the city.

==Archaeology==
In 2019, one of the earliest rural mosques in the world was unearthed in Rahat, apparently dating to a century or two after the founding of Islam.

<text>Rehovot (, / ) is a city in the Central District of Israel, about south of Tel Aviv. In it had a population of .

==Etymology==
Israel Belkind, founder of the Bilu movement, proposed the name &quot;Rehovot&quot; (lit. &#x27;wide expanses&#x27;) based on Genesis 26:22: &quot;And he called the name of it &quot;Rehoboth&quot;; and he said: &#x27;For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land&#x27;.&quot; This Bible verse is also inscribed in the city&#x27;s logo. The biblical town of &quot;Rehoboth&quot; was located in the Negev Desert.

== History ==
Rehovot was established in 1890 by pioneers of the First Aliyah on the coastal plain near a site called &quot;Khirbat Deiran&quot;, an &quot;abandoned or sparsely populated&quot; estate, which now lies in the center of the built-up area of the city. According to Marom, Deiran offered &quot;a convenient launching pad for early land purchase initiatives which shaped the pattern of Jewish settlement until the beginning of the British Mandate&quot;.

Rehovot was founded as a moshava in 1890 by Polish Jewish immigrants who had come with the First Aliyah, seeking to establish a township which would not be under the influence of the Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, on land which was purchased from a Christian Arab by the Menuha Venahala society, an organization in Warsaw that raised funds for Jewish settlement in Eretz Israel.

In March 1892, a dispute over pasture rights erupted between the residents of Rehovot and the neighboring village of Zarnuqa, which took two years to resolve. Another dispute broke out with the Suteriya Bedouin tribe, which had been cultivating some of the land as tenant farmers. According to Moshe Smilansky, one of the early settlers of Rehovot, the Bedouins had received compensation for the land, but refused to vacate it. In 1893, they attacked the moshava. Through the intervention of a respected Arab sheikh, a compromise was reached, with the Bedouins receiving an additional sum of money, which they used to dig a well.

In 1890, the region was an uncultivated wasteland with no trees, houses or water. The moshava&#x27;s houses were initially built along two parallel streets: Yaakov Street and Benjamin Street, before later expanding, and vineyards, almond orchards and citrus groves were planted, but the inhabitants grappled with agricultural failures, plant diseases, and marketing problems.

The first citrus grove was planted by Zalman Minkov in 1904. Minkov&#x27;s grove, surrounded by a wall, included a guard house, stables, a packing plant, and an irrigation system in which groundwater was pumped from a large well in the inner courtyard. The well was 23 meters deep, the height of an eight-story building, and over six meters in diameter. The water was channeled via an aqueduct to an irrigation pool, and from there to a network of ditches dug around the bases of the trees.

The Great Synagogue of Rehovot was established in 1903, during the First Aliyah period.

In 1908, the Workman&#x27;s Union (&quot;Hapoel Hazair&quot;) organized a group of 300 Yemenite immigrants then living in the region of Jerusalem and Jaffa, bringing them to work as farmers in the colonies of Rishon-le-Zion and Rehovot. Only a few dozen Yemenite families had settled in Rehovot by 1908. They built houses for themselves in a plot given to them at the south end of the town, which became known as Sha&#x27;araim. In 1910, Shmuel Warshawsky, with the secret support of the JNF, was sent to Yemen to recruit more agricultural laborers. Hundreds arrived starting in 1911 and were housed first in a compound one kilometre south of Rehovot and then in a large extension of the Sha&#x27;araim quarter.

The second Zarnuqa incident, that took place in July 1913 between the colonists and guards of Rehovot, and the Arab rural population, is considered by historians as a milestone in Zionist–Arab relations in late Ottoman Palestine. The incident, which started over simple accusation of theft of grapes from a Jewish-owned vineyard, became much more than a local incident, left one Arab and two Jews dead and resulted in tremendous hostility between the two sides. There are various narratives available to researchers today, including Jewish, Arabic sources and external sources. It is difficult to determine whose narrative is closer to historical reality, or to find out who started the fight and who is to be blamed. This incident illustrates the difficult task facing historians in analyzing the late Ottoman Palestine, the period of the early Zionist–Arab encounter and conflict. It is alleged that this was the moment when a previously peaceful co-existence among Jews and Arabs, united under the Ottoman Empire, instantly became an &quot;us vs. them&quot; divisiveness that has prevailed ever since.
In February 1914, Rothschild visited Rehovot during the fourth of his five visits to the Land of Israel. That year, Rehovot had a population of around 955.

===British Mandate===
In 1920, the Rehovot Railway Station was opened, which greatly boosted the local citrus fruit industry. A few packing houses were built near the station to enable the fruit to be sent by railway to the rest of the country and to the port of Jaffa for export to Europe. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Rehovot had a population of 1,242 inhabitants, consisting of 1,241 Jews and 1 Muslim, increasing in 1931 census to 3,193 inhabitants, in 833 houses.
In 1924, the British Army contracted the Palestine Electric Company for wired electric power. The contract allowed the Electric Company to extend the grid beyond the original geographical limits that had been projected by the concession it was given. The high-voltage line that exceeded the limits of the original concession ran along some major towns and agricultural settlements, offering extended connections to the Jewish towns of Rishon Le-Zion, Ness Ziona and Rehovot (in spite of their proximity to the high-voltage line, the Arab towns of Ramla and Lod remained unconnected).

In 1931, the first workers moshav, &quot;Kfar Marmorek&quot;, was built on lands which were acquired from the village of Zarnuqa by the Jewish National Fund in 1926, and ten Yemenite Jewish families which were evicted from Kinneret were resettled there. Later, they were joined by thirty-five other families from Sha&#x27;araim. Today, they are both suburbs of Rehovot.

The agricultural research station that opened in Rehovot in 1932 later became the Department of Agriculture of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1933, a juice factory was built. In 1934, Chaim Weizmann established the Sieff Institute, which later became the Weizmann Institute of Science. In 1937, Weizmann built his home on the land purchased adjacent to the Sieff Institute. The house later served as the presidential residence after Weizmann became president in 1948. Weizmann and his wife are buried on the grounds of the institute.

In 1945, Rehovot had a population of 10,020, and in 1948, it had grown to 12,500. The suburb of Rehovot, &quot;Kefar Marmorek&quot;, had a population of 500 Jews in 1948.

===State of Israel===
On 29 February 1948, the Lehi blew up the Cairo to Haifa train shortly after it left Rehovot, killing 29 British soldiers and injuring 35. Lehi said the bombing was in retaliation for the Ben Yehuda Street bombing a week earlier. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; reported that both Weizmann&#x27;s home and the Agricultural Institute were damaged in the explosion, although the sites were away. On 28 March 1948, Arabs attacked a Jewish convoy near Rehovot. In 1950, Rehovot, which had a population of about 18,000, was declared a city.

In the immediate years following the establishment of Israel, the &quot;Zarnuqa&quot; ma&#x27;abara (now named &quot;Kiryat Moshe&quot;) was established on the Southern side of Rehovot to house Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe and Arab lands. On the Southwest, the neighborhood of &quot;Kfar Gevirol&quot; (now named &quot;Ibn Gevirol&quot;, named after Solomon ibn Gabirol, 11th Century Sephardi Jewish Philosopher) was founded on lands of the depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Qubayba. Over the years, &quot;Kiryat Moshe&quot; expanded over the lands of the depopulated Palestinian village of Zarnuqa. The mosque of the village, while abandoned, still stands. On the Southeast the neighborhood of Ramat Aharon were established. The city has since then expanded in all directions, geographically surrounding but not including the Kibbutz of Kvutzat Shiller and the Moshav of Gibton.

==Demographics==
Between 1914 and 1991, the town&#x27;s population rose from 955 to 81,000, and its area more than doubled. Parts of Rehovot&#x27;s suburbs are built on land that belonged to the village of Zarnuqa before 1948, population 2,620, including 240 Jews in Gibton. In 1995, there were 337,800 people living in the greater Rehovot area. , the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.8% Jewish. There were 49,600 males and 52,300 females, of whom 31.6% were 19 years of age or younger, 16.1% between the ages of 20 and 29, 18.2% between 30 and 44, 18.2% from 45 to 59, 3.5% from 60 to 64, and 12.3% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate was 1.8%.

In Rehovot, there are mainly Russian Jews, Yemenite Jews, and Ethiopian Jews, who are concentrated largely in the Kiryat Moshe and Oshiot areas. There is a growing community of religious Anglo-speaking people who primarily live in Northern Rehovot around the Weizmann Institute of Science.

According to the 2019 census, the population of Rehovot was counted to be 143,904, of which 143,536 people, comprising 99.7% of the city&#x27;s population were classified as &quot;Jews and Others&quot;, and 368 people, comprising 0.3% as &quot;Arab&quot;.

== Education and culture ==
The city is home to the Weizmann Institute of Science, the Faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Peres Academic Center College. There are also several smaller colleges in Rehovot that provide specialized and technical training. Kaplan Medical Center acts as an ancillary teaching hospital for the Medical School of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The Minkov Orchard Museum was established in Rehovot with the assistance of the Swiss descendants of Zalma Minkov, whose husband planted the city&#x27;s first citrus grove.

Rehovot is also home to the annual Rehovot International Live Statues Festival which includes many international participants.

There were 1,082 people receiving unemployment benefits and 6,627 people receiving an income guarantee. In 2013, Rehovot had the highest average net monthly income among households in Israel, at NIS 16,800.

Rehovot is home to numerous industrial plants, and has an industrial park in the western part of the city. Among them are the Tnuva dairy plant, the Yafora-Tavori beverage factory, and the Feldman ice cream factory.

The Tamar Science Park, established in 2000, is a high-tech park of at the northern entrance of the city. The Tamar Science Park adjoins the older Kiryat Weizmann industrial park. Although the entire extended science park is largely conceived as an area of Rehovot, the Kiryat Weizmann part is actually under the municipal boundaries of neighboring Ness Ziona. Tamar Science Park is home to branches of leading hi-tech like Stratasys, Imperva, Applied Materials, El-Op and bio-tech companies like Aleph Farms.

Rehovot railway station is a suburban commuter railway station serving the city. It is a historic station that was abandoned in 1948 and reopened in 1990 with a suburban service to Tel Aviv, which is important because many Rehovot residents work in Tel Aviv. More reconstruction work began in 2000, which included the two new passenger terminals, a pedestrian tunnel under the railway, a bus terminal and two large parking lots. The station is situated on the Tel Aviv suburban line (Binyamina/Netanya – Tel Aviv – Rehovot/Ashkelon Suburban Service). All trains in this service stop at Rehovot, and some trains terminate at the station. This line connects the city to Tel Aviv via Lod.

The city will be served by 5 Metro Stations along one of the Southern Branches of Line M1 as part of the Tel Aviv Metro Project. This line will connect the city to Tel Aviv via Holon.

The city is served internally and connected to other cities by bus routes operated by Egged Bus Company.

===Roads===

Rehovot is located between Highway 40 and Highway 42. Highway 40 connects the city to Kiryat Gat and Beersheva in the South, while Highway 42 connects it to Ashdod. Highway 40 connects the city to Lod-Ramla to the North, also providing connection to Ben Gurion Airport, and bypassing Metro Tel Aviv along the eastern edge, whereas Highway 42 connects the city to Rishon LeZion and the urban centre of Metro Tel Aviv.

Rehovot also has access to the east–west Motorway 431, connecting the city to Modi&#x27;in as well as to Jerusalem on the East.

Route 412 (Weizmann Street) is a regional road that goes through the city centre in a Northwest-Southeast Direction, and connects it to neighbouring Ness Ziona.

<text>A humane society is a group that aims to stop cruelty to animals. In many countries, the term is used mostly for societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA). In the United Kingdom, and historically in the United States, such societies provide waterway rescue, prevention and recovery services, or may give awards for saving human life (e.g., Glasgow Humane Society and Massachusetts Humane Society).
== Australia ==
The first Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), based on the British Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), was set up in Victoria in 1871. This was followed by New South Wales in 1873; South Australia in 1875; Tasmania in 1878; Queensland in 1883; Western Australia in 1892; Australian Capital Territory in 1955 and Darwin in 1965.
The Royal Warrant was given to the WA SPCA in 1920, followed by NSW SPCA in 1923, South Australia in 1937, Queensland in 1955, Tasmania in 1956 and Victoria in 1956.

The national organisation, RSPCA Australia, was formed in 1981 to give a national voice on policy matters and advise the federal government on animal welfare issues.

== Canada ==

The first SPCA in Canada was the Canadian SPCA founded in Montreal in 1869. The other societies developed on a regional basis and now 123 societies are represented at a federal level by Humane Canada, formerly named the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.

== New Zealand ==

Early British settlers brought with them the laws of England, and the British Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 was adopted by New Zealand. This was replaced by New Zealand&#x27;s own Protection of Animals Act in 1878, and the first SPCA was formed in Dunedin in 1882 quickly followed by other societies. In 1933, all the societies amalgamated as a federation and this grew into the present day&#x27;s Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The Humane Society of New Zealand was established as a registered charity in 1975.

== United Kingdom ==
The first humane societies were founded in the United Kingdom. They included the Royal Humane Society in 1774, the Glasgow Humane Society in 1790, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in 1824.

The Royal Humane Society is a charity that grants awards for acts of bravery in the saving of human lives, and for the restoration of life by resuscitation. Since its foundation, the society has given more than 85,000 awards. The Glasgow Humane Society is a prevention, rescue, and recovery group set up to cover the waterways of Greater Glasgow, Scotland.

The main animal humane societies in the UK are the RSPCA and its offshoots, the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) and the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA). There is also the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), founded in 1917, to treat the sick and injured animals of the poor, and numerous other animal rescue charities for wildlife, working animals, and domestic pets.

== United States ==

The first SPCA in the United States was the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), founded by Henry Bergh in New York City in 1866. Two years later, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded in Boston by a group that included George Thorndike Angell, John Quincy Adams II, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Saltonstall, and William Gordon Weld. Examples of other national, nonsheltering humane animal societies include: American Humane Association, which was founded in 1877 as a network of local organizations to prevent cruelty to children and animals. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) was established in 1954.

=== National vs. local humane societies ===
Humane societies in the U.S. are independent of similarly named national organizations such as the HSUS or ASPCA. While local organizations are concerned primarily with sheltering, adoption, and euthanasia of animals, these national organizations coordinate and address broader issues beyond the scope or resources of the smaller, independent groups.

The HSUS does not operate, control, or fund local humane societies. It does provide support through grants, training of animal care personnel, standards of care, and evaluation services. The HSUS frequently works with shelters in disaster operations and large-scale animal rescues, assisting in the evaluation, triage, handling, transport and care of rescued animals. The HSUS maintains the animalsheltering.com website for animal care professionals, and publishes a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;Animal Sheltering&quot; to which 12,300 shelters and rescue groups subscribe.

The HSUS provides national promotion of shelters and animal adoptions, alone or in partnership with other animal protection charities. The Shelter Pet Project is a joint venture of the HSUS, Maddie&#x27;s Fund, and the Ad Council to promote awareness of shelters and encourage adoptions.

<text>Shefa-Amr or Shfar&#x27;am (, Šafāʻamru, , Šəfarʻam) is an Arab city in the Northern District of Israel. In it had a population of , with a Sunni Muslim majority and large Christian Arab and Druze minorities.

==Etymology==
Palmer writes that the name meant: &quot;The margin or edge of &#x27;Amr. Locally and erroneously supposed to mean the healing of &#x27;Amer (ed Dhaher).&quot; The city is identified with &quot;Shefar&#x27;am&quot;, an ancient Jewish town of great significance during Talmudic times. Some have proposed that its original meaning may be linked to the Hebrew words &quot;&quot;Shefer&quot; (שֶׁפֶר), signifying something nice, beautiful or good, and &quot;&#x27;Am&quot;&quot;, (עַם) which translates to people.

==History==
===Ancient period===
Walls, installations and pottery sherds from the Early Bronze Age IB and the Middle Bronze Age IIB, Iron, Hellenistic and Roman periods have been excavated at Shefa-ʻAmr.

Shefa-Amr is first mentioned under the name &quot;Shefar&#x27;am&quot; () in the Tosefta (Tractate Mikvaot 6:1), followed by the Talmud redacted in 500 CE where it is mentioned in several places, in Tractate &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 8b and &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; 31b, &quot;et al.&quot;

Settlement has existed there without interruption since the Roman period, when it was one of the cities mentioned in the Talmud as containing the seat of the Jewish Sanhedrin during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The seat of the Sanhedrin was traditionally thought to be where the Old Synagogue &quot;Maḥaneh Shekhinah&quot; was built in later times. Old Shefa-&#x27;Amr was settled in the area where are now built the Police Station, the various Churches and Jews&#x27; Street. Decorated burial caves were documented by the Survey of Western Palestine in the late nineteenth century; they were found to be Christian tombs from the Byzantine era, dating to the 5th and 6th century CE. Greek inscriptions were also found.

Archaeological excavations of a cave and quarries revealed that they were used in the Roman and Byzantine eras. Shefa-ʻAmr contains Byzantine remains, including a church and tombs.

A salvage dig was conducted in the southern quarter of the old city exposing remains from five phases in the Late Byzantine and early Umayyad periods. Finds include a tabun oven, a pavement of small fieldstones, a mosaic pavement that was probably part of a wine press treading floor, a small square wine press, handmade kraters, an imported Cypriot bowl and an open cooking pot. Also discovered were glass and pottery vessels.

===Middle Ages===
Under the Crusaders the place was known as &quot;Safran&quot;, &quot;Sapharanum&quot;, &quot;Castrum Zafetanum&quot;, &quot;Saphar castrum&quot; or &quot;Cafram&quot;. The Crusaders built a fortress, used by the Knights Templar, in the village. At the foot of the castle was a fortified settlement with a church, inhabited either by local Christians or Crusaders. The village, then called &quot;Shafar &#x27;Am&quot;, was used by Muslim leader Saladin between 1190–91 and 1193-94 as a military base for attacks on Acre.

By 1229, the place was back in Crusader hands; this was confirmed by Sultan Baybars in the peace treaty of 1271, and by Sultan Qalawun in 1283. Italian monk Riccoldo da Monte di Croce visited the village in 1287–88, and noted that it had Christian inhabitants. It apparently was under Mamluk control by 1291, as it was mentioned in that year when sultan al-Ashraf Khalil allocated the town&#x27;s income to a charitable organization in Cairo.

===Ottoman period===
The region became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the Ottoman tax census of 1525–26, Shefa-Amr had a population of 150, 90% of whom were Muslims and 10% Jews. The population increased to 388 in the 1538–39 census, with Jews constituting 13% of the inhabitants. According to the records of 1547–48 and 1555–56, Shefa-Amr had a population 423 and 594 respectively, all Muslims. In 1564, the revenues of the village of Shefa-Amr were designated for the new waqf (endowment) of Hasseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem, established by Hasseki Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana), the wife of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.

In the census of , the village had a population of 510 Muslims. A 1573 firman (decree) mentioned that Shefa-Amr was among a group of villages in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub district) of Acre in rebellion against the state. By 1577, the village had accumulated an arsenal of 200 muskets. In the 1596 tax records, Shefa-Amr was part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Acre, part of Safed Sanjak, with a population of 83 households (&quot;khana&quot;), and eight bachelors, all Muslims. The total revenue was 13,600 akçe, most of which was given in fixed amounts. The taxable produce also comprised occasional revenues, goats and beehives, and the inhabitants paid for the use or ownership of an olive oil press.


During the 18th century Shefa-Amr was the center of its own fiscal district in the province of Sidon. Its importance derived from its position in the heart of the Galilee&#x27;s cotton-growing area and its natural and man-made defenses. The significance of cotton to the growth of Shefa-Amr was fundamental. Tax returns for the village attest to the large returns expected of this crop. Its local prominence was headed by the sheikhs of the Zayadina (sing. Zaydani), a local family of multazims (limited-term tax farmers), in charge of collecting taxes for the governor of Sidon. As early as 1704, the village was held as a tax farm by the Zaydani sheikh Ali ibn Salih, along with other villages in the Lower Galilee. At an unknown point after, the Zayadina lost Shefa-Amr but Ali&#x27;s son Muhammad of al-Damun had regained control of it by , during a period when the Zayadina were expanding their holdings across the Galilee under the leadership of Zahir al-Umar (Muhammad&#x27;s first cousin). 

It is known that there was a castle in the village by this time. Its fortifications were strengthened by the Zayadina in during a respite in the sieges of the Zaydani stronghold of Tiberias by the governor of Damascus. Afterward, in 1743, Muhammad was arrested and executed by Zahir&#x27;s order to remove him as an obstacle to Zahir&#x27;s regional ambitions. In 1761, Zahir offerred to grant Shefa-Amr to his son Uthman in exchange for the latter assassinating Zahir&#x27;s brother Sa&#x27;d. Although Uthman complied, Zahir reneged following protestations by Shefa-Amr&#x27;s inhabitants. Uthman and his brothers Ahmad and Sa&#x27;id besieged the village in 1765 but were repulsed by its local defenders with Zahir&#x27;s support. Uthman was nevertheless granted Shefa-Amr at some point by Zahir. He is generally credited as the builder of its large fortress.

After Zahir&#x27;s death in 1775, the Ottoman-appointed governor Jazzar Pasha allowed Uthman to continue as subgovernor of Shefa-Amr in return for a promise of loyalty and advance payment of taxes. Jazzar Pasha ignored orders from Constantinople to demolish the village&#x27;s fortress. Several years later Uthman was removed and replaced by Ibrahim Abu Qalush, an appointee of Jazzar Pasha, who rebelled against him in 1789. A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as &quot;Chafa Amr&quot;.
A Jewish community had been established in the village under the auspices of Zahir&#x27;s rule. In 1839, Moses Montefiore counted 107 Sephardic Jews living in Shefa-Amr. Their condition worsened with the departure of the autonomous leader of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, during which time Shefa-Amr was nearly emptied of its Jewish residents, who had opted to move to Haifa and Tiberias. James Finn wrote in 1877 that &quot;The majority of the inhabitants are Druses. There are a few Moslems and a few Christians; but [in 1850] there were thirty Jewish families living as agriculturists, cultivating grain and olives on their own landed property, most of it family inheritance; some of these people were of Algerine descent. They had their own synagogue and legally qualified butcher, and their numbers had formerly been more considerable.&quot; However, &quot;they afterwards dwindled to two families, the rest removing to [Haifa] as that port rose in prosperity.&quot; 

Conder and Kitchener, who visited in 1875, was told that the community consisted of &quot;2,500 souls—1,200 being Moslems, the rest Druses, Greeks, and Latins.&quot; The town&#x27;s Druze community dwindled considerably in the 1880s as its members migrated east to the Hauran plain to avoid conscription by the Ottoman authorities. A population list from about 1887 showed that Shefa-Amr had about 2,750 inhabitants; 795 Muslims, 95 Greek Catholics, 1,100 Catholics, 140 Latins, 175 Maronites/Protestants, 30 Jews and 440 Druze. That year, some 42 Jewish families from Morocco settled in Shefa-Amr.

=== British Mandate ===

The British Mandate of Palestine was established in 1920. By then, all of Shefa-Amr&#x27;s Jews had moved out. According to the 1922 census of Palestine, Shefa-Amr had a population of 2,288: 1,263 Christians, 623 Muslims, and 402 Druze. Of the Christians, 1,054 were Melkites (Greek Catholics), 94 Anglicans, 70 Roman Catholics, 42 Greek Orthodox and three Maronitew. By the 1931 census, Shefa-Amr had 629 occupied houses and a population of 1,321 Christians, 1,006 Muslims, 496 Druze, and one Jew. A further 1,197 Muslims in 234 occupied houses was recorded for &quot;Shafa &#x27;Amr Suburbs&quot;.

Statistics compiled by the Mandatory government in the 1945 statistics showed an urban population of 1,560 Christians, 1,380 Muslims, 10 Jews and 690 &quot;others&quot; (presumably Druze) and a rural population of 3,560 Muslims.

=== Israel ===
==== 20th century ====
In 1948 Shefa-Amr was captured by the Israeli Army during the first phase of Operation Dekel, from 8 to 14 July. The Druze population actively cooperated with the IDF. The Muslim quarter was heavily shelled and thousands of inhabitants fled to Saffuriyeh. Following the fall of Nazareth some of the refugees were allowed to return to their homes. After the end of the war, the Arab population was placed under strict martial law until 1967.

Ibraheem Nimr Hussein, a former mayor of Shefa-Amr, was chairman of the Committee of Arab Mayors in Israel (later the Arab Follow-Up Committee) from its inception in 1975. In 1981 an NGO to promote health care in the Arab community was set up in Shefa-Amr. It called itself &quot;&quot; - the Arab National Society for Health Research and Services. In 1982, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Mayor Ibrahim Nimr Husayn formed the &quot;Supreme Follow-Up Committee&quot; based on a committee that had been formed following Land Day. It consisted of 11 heads of local councils as well as Arab Members of Knesset. By the 1990s the committee, meeting in Nazareth, had expanded and become a mini-parliament representing Palestinians in the Galilee.

==== 21st century ====

On 16 May 2004, Whehebe Moheen, a man in his sixties, murdered Manal Najeeb Abu Raed, his widowed daughter-in-law, wife of his son, and mother of his two granddaughters. Manal had lost her husband to cancer two years earlier, and was living in the couple&#x27;s home, in the Druze village of Daliat El Carmel, near Haifa. Following this event there was conflict between the families of the victim and of the killer. The final reconciliation took place on 27 February 2009, when about 300 family members, dignitaries and residents of the mixed city of Shefa-Amr and Daliyat al-Carmel participated in the reconciliation ritual. They gathered, along with Christian and Muslim dignitaries, including mayors of the two towns involved, Knesset members (Druze and Muslim), the religious leader of Israel&#x27;s Druze community, and a sizable contingent of Druze religious leaders from many villages in northern Israel. Following the speeches, the dignitaries signed the &quot;sulha&quot; (reconciliation) agreement, and after the document was declared officially endorsed, the killer&#x27;s family handed the leader of the &quot;sulha&quot; committee, Sheikh Muafak Tarif, a bag containing the blood money (&quot;diya&quot;) compensation, and Tarif handed the bag to cousins of the murdered woman. The bag contained 200,000 NIS (about US$50,000), about half what a &quot;normal&quot; conciliation payment would be, but the killer&#x27;s family refused to bring more money, claiming that they had no resources, and were not prepared to make themselves bankrupt because of a &quot;crazy&quot; uncle.

On 4 August 2005, an Israeli soldier who was absent without leave, Eden Natan-Zada, opened fire while aboard a bus in the city, killing four Arab residents and wounding twenty-two others. After the shooting, Natan-Zada was overcome by nearby crowds, lynched and beaten with rocks. According to witnesses, the bus driver was surprised to see a &quot;kippah&quot;-wearing Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-Amr via public bus, so inquired of Natan-Zada whether he was certain he wanted to take his current route. The four fatalities were two sisters in their early twenties, Hazar and Dina Turki, and two men, bus driver Michel Bahouth and Nader Hayek. In the days following the attack, 40,000 people attended mass funeral services for the victims. The sisters were buried in an Islamic cemetery and the men were buried in the Catholic cemetery. The wounded were taken to Rambam Hospital in Haifa. The Shefa-Amr municipality established a monument to commemorate the victims.

In January 2008, Mayor Ursan Yassin met with officials of the Israeli state committee on the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of independence, and announced that Shefa-Amr intended to take part in the celebrations. In 2011, 7,000 Christians, Druze and Muslims held a solidarity march in support of Christians in Iraq and Egypt who were suffering from religious persecution.

==Geography==
Shefa-Amr is located in the North District of Israel at the entrance to the Galilee. It is located from the Mediterranean Sea and from each of three cities, Haifa, Acre and Nazareth, where many of the inhabitants are employed. The city is located on seven hills, which gives it the name &quot;Little Rome&quot;. The elevation of the city and its strategic location as the connection between the valleys and mountains of Galilee made it more than once the center of its district, especially in the period of Uthman, the son of Zahir al-Umar, who built a castle in it, and towers around it. The bay of Haifa with the sea stretching between Haifa and Acre and the high mountains of Galilee and the valleys surrounding the city could be seen from high points in the city.

In 1951, the population was 4450, of whom about 10% were internally displaced persons from other villages. During the early 1950s, about 25,000 dunams of the land of Shefa-Amr were expropriated by the following method: the land was declared a closed military area, then after enough time had passed for it to have become legally &quot;uncultivated&quot;, the Minister of Agriculture used his powers to &quot;ensure that it was cultivated&quot; by giving it to neighboring Jewish majority communities. Some of the land was owned by Jews. Another 7,579 dunams were expropriated in 1953–4. The total land holdings of the village fell from 58,725 dunams in 1945 to 10,371 dunams in 1962.

==Landmarks and religious sites==

*A fort was built in 1760 by Zahir al-Umar to secure the entrance to Galilee. The fort was built on the ruins of a Crusader fort called &quot;Le Seffram&quot;. The ground floor of the fort stabled the horses, the first floor above ground was for Zahir&#x27;s residential quarters. Zahir&#x27;s fort is considered the biggest fort remaining in the Galilee. After the establishment of the state, the fort was used as a police station. After a new station was built in the &quot;Fawwar&quot; neighbourhood, the fort was renovated and converted to a youth center, which has since closed down.
*&quot;The Tower&quot; or &quot;al Burj&quot; is an old Crusader fort located in the southern part of the city.

*The old market of Shefa-Amr was once the bustling heart of the city. Now all that remains is one coffee shop where elderly men gather every day to play backgammon and drink coffee. According to the mayor of Shefa-Amr, Nahed Khazem, the government provided a budget for improving and reviving the old market and developing the area around the fort as a tourist attraction.
*The Shfaram Ancient Synagogue is an old synagogue on the site of an even older structure. It is recorded as being active in 1845. A Muslim resident of the town holds the keys. The synagogue was renovated in 2006. The tomb of Rabbi Judah ben Baba, a well-known rabbi from the 2nd century who was captured and executed by the Romans, is still standing and many Jewish believers come to visit it.
*Byzantine period tombs are located in the middle of the city. They were the graves of the 5th and 6th-century Christian community. The tomb entrances are decorated with sculptures of lions and Greek inscriptions which make mention of Jesus.
*In the center of the city, where the Sisters of Nazareth convent now stands, was a 4th-century church, St. Jacob&#x27;s. This church is mentioned in the notes of ecclesiastical historians, although the original church has been replaced by the monastery. Some marble columns remain, similar to those used to build the earliest churches.
*St. Peter &amp; St. Paul Church is located in one of the town&#x27;s peaks near the fort, it has a high bell tower and a large purple dome. The church was built by Otman, who made a promise to build it if his fort was finished successfully. The walls of the church began to weaken, and in 1904 the entire church building was reinforced and renovated. This is the main church of the local Greek Catholic community.
*The Mosque of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (Old Mosque) was constructed near the castle in the days of Sulayman Pasha

<text>Basil Brush is a fictional fox best known for his appearances on daytime British children&#x27;s television. He is primarily portrayed by a glove puppet, but has also been depicted in animated cartoon shorts, books, annuals and comic strips. The character has featured on children&#x27;s television from the 1960s to the present day. He has also appeared in pantomimes across the UK.

A mischievous character and a raconteur, Basil Brush is best known for his catchphrase &quot;Ha Ha Ha! Boom! Boom!&quot;, used after something he finds funny, and also for speaking in a &quot;posh&quot; accent and manner, referring to himself as a &quot;fella&quot;. The character claims to dislike puppets, and says his most prized possession is his brush, this being the traditional name for a fox&#x27;s tail. He publicly supports the Leicester City Football Club, which he refers to as &quot;the foxes&quot;.

==1962-1968==

The original Basil Brush glove puppet was designed by Peter Firmin in 1962 for an ITV television series and was voiced and performed by Ivan Owen until his death in October 2000.

Ivan Owen took great care to ensure that he, personally, never received any publicity. Professionally, only Basil had a public persona, with Owen himself remaining entirely unknown. This helped give the character believability, making Basil appear to be real, since—unlike Harry Corbett and Sooty, for example—the audience never saw the puppeteer. Owen modelled Basil&#x27;s voice on the actor Terry-Thomas, giving the puppet a touch of well-cultivated class.

Basil first appeared on television in 1962, in a series called &quot;The Three Scampies&quot;, a story of an out-of-work circus act. The human was Howard Williams, Ivan Owen animated and voiced Basil and Wally Whyton animated and voiced Spike McPike, a very aggressive Scottish hedgehog also made by Peter Firmin.

In the mid-1960s, Basil became a supporting act for the magician David Nixon, upstaging Nixon on the latter&#x27;s BBC1 show &quot;Nixon at Nine-Five&quot; in 1967 and &quot;The Nixon Line&quot; (1967–68), to such good effect that Basil was offered his own show.

==&quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; (1968-1980)==

&quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; ran for 12 years from 1968 to 1980, in which he was supported by various famous stooges: first, in 1968, by the actor Rodney Bewes, known on the show as &quot;Mr Rodney&quot;; next, from 1969 to 1973, by the actor Derek Fowlds (known as &quot;Mr Derek&quot;); then until 1976 by actor and singer Roy North (&quot;Mr Roy&quot;); then by &quot;Mr Howard&quot; Howard Williams, who was in the original &quot;Three Scampies&quot;; and finally by &quot;Mr Billy&quot; (Billy Boyle). By the mid-1970s, the show was aimed at a family audience, so it was usually broadcast on BBC1 in an early evening timeslot on Saturdays. This, plus a degree of sophistication in the humour (which often included topical political jokes), helped give Basil a broad mainstream appeal.

The show was recorded with a studio audience and usually ran for about 25 minutes. The format typically featured an introduction by Basil and his stooge (Mr Rodney, Mr Derek, etc.), in which they would do a few jokes; this was followed by a comedy sketch, featuring topical jokes about a then-current subject (for instance, a sketch set on board an aeroplane flying them to a holiday in Spain, loosely based around the hit pop song &quot;Y Viva España&quot;); then a musical item, featuring a guest singer or group (these included some of the best known singers of the day, top stars such as Demis Roussos in 1973, Petula Clark in 1979, and Cilla Black — big stars vied to get on the show, which had a large audience); sometimes the guest singer would do a song straight, but then also do a comic duet with Basil.

Finally, the show would conclude with &#x27;storytime&#x27;, in which the straight man would read aloud from a serial story about the adventures of some fictitious historical relative of Basil&#x27;s – for instance &#x27;Bulldog&#x27; Basil, or Blast-Off Basil and his journey to the stars (a &quot;Star Trek&quot; spoof), or Basil de Farmer, the knight in shining armour (a Robin Hood spoof); or at least he would attempt to, whilst being continually interrupted by a string of jokes and humorous remarks (often concerning &quot;Dirty Gertie from Number Thirty&quot;) from Basil. At this point, in the mid-1970s, Basil would often get out Little Ticker, his clockwork wind-up dog, and have it do humorous tricks at the side, almost off-camera, in order to distract the audience and thereby take the rise out of Mr Roy. Each week&#x27;s story ended on a cliffhanger and the catchphrase &quot;and that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got time for this week, Basil&quot;, followed by protestations from Basil which would lead into a final song, based upon that week&#x27;s serial story, whilst the closing credits rolled.

==1980s==
A dispute in 1980 led to the show&#x27;s cancellation. Ivan Owen aspired to a mid-evening timeslot, to which the BBC were unwilling to agree. In 1982, the puppet reappeared on television in &quot;Let&#x27;s Read With Basil Brush&quot;, an infant schools programme on ITV produced by Granada Television. Basil eventually returned to the BBC as co-host of the long-running children&#x27;s television series &quot;Crackerjack&quot;, broadcast at 4:55pm on Fridays during the 1983–84 season.

Basil Brush also performed in the theatre, regularly appearing live in Pantomime at Christmas; usually co-starring at the top of the bill with a well-known singer or comedian. His pantomime co-stars during the 1960s included the singer Cilla Black. After the television show&#x27;s cancellation in 1980, Basil ended his partnership with Mr Billy and teamed up once again with Howard Williams (&quot;Mr Howard&quot;); they toured in a live stage show, capitalising on Basil&#x27;s celebrity and continuing popularity as a result of thirteen years on TV.

During this period, Basil also featured in his own cartoon strip in the children&#x27;s publication &quot;TV Comic&quot;, published weekly in Britain by Polystyle Publications.

==2000s relaunch==
In September 1997, Ivan Owen and Peter Firmin sold the rights to Basil Brush to Bill Haslam, a Cornwall-based businessman and a longtime fan of the character. Haslam formed a Southampton-based company called &quot;Boom! Boom!&quot; with the aim of relaunching Basil Brush with a new television series and public appearances.

After Haslam&#x27;s attempts at relaunching Basil went to little avail, leading to a £55,000 loss, he sold Boom! Boom! to children&#x27;s media company SKD Media (later Entertainment Rights) in July 1999, and joined SKD in help to relaunch the property with a new television series. In August 2000, Entertainment Rights announced a new six-episode sitcom series titled &quot;Foxed&quot;, in co-production with Talent Television, and was in talks with both BBC and ITV for the series&#x27; pre-sale. After a toy-deal with Hasbro was confirmed, the series was retooled and became &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot;, which in January 2002 was announced to air on the CBBC Channel in the Autumn. However, the series would instead be co-produced with The Foundation.

The series, while still maintaining the faithfulness of the original series, was in the format of a children&#x27;s sitcom that took place in a flat. Basil who is now performed and voiced by Michael Winsor was joined by a new comic foil, Mr Stephen, played by Christopher Pizzey, who was later replaced with his Northern Irish cousin Liam (Michael Byers) in 2006. Two new child friends - the moneymaking child Dave (Michael Hayes) and the more sensible Molly (Georgina Leonidas) (who were Stephen&#x27;s nephew and niece), in addition to other characters like Madison, who lived upstairs, and Anil (Ajay Chhabra), a crazy café owner and inept cook. Anil&#x27;s niece, Lucy (Janine Vieira in Season 5 and Madeline Castrey in Season 6), appeared in the last two seasons in place of Molly as the female child friend of Basil. Basil Brush now had a family, which included his destructive, hyperactive but cute nephew Bingo, and his criminal cousin Mortimer. Several personalities made cameo appearances on the show. These included Eamonn Holmes and Ainsley Harriott.

The original shows had been recorded before a studio audience, composed mainly of children, but the new programme used a post-production laughter track instead of an audience. Interspersed with the main programme, there were animated shorts in which Basil and/or another character is seen making jokes. The more recent puppet looks different from the original 1960s/1970s puppet in a number of aspects and, apart from being well-spoken, the voice of Basil is very different from the original Ivan Owen version. Basil Brush often breaks the fourth wall by having shots of the set and making references to how long the show is, and abusing the obvious way of walking across to other scenes.

==Preservation==
The British Film Institute in November 2016 announced &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; would be digitised as part of the BFI&#x27;s five-year strategy for 2017–2022 to preserve programmes from the 1970s and 80s. Many of the tapes at the BFI&#x27;s Conservation Centre in Hertfordshire were reportedly deteriorating and at risk of becoming unplayable. Since October 2023, the Film is Fabulous! project has reported a recovery of three episodes from the fourth series of The Basil Brush show. Prior to this discovery, no episodes from this series were present in the archives, however now episodes 2, 6, and 10 of the 15 episode series exist in the archives.

<text>Theoretical computer science is a subfield of computer science and mathematics that focuses on the abstract and mathematical foundations of computation.

It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM&#x27;s Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:

== History ==
While logical inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 Kurt Gödel proved with his incompleteness theorem that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.

Information theory was added to the field with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by Claude Shannon. In the same decade, Donald Hebb introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were established. In 1971, Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid Levin, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete – a landmark result in computational complexity theory.

Modern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:

== Topics ==

===Algorithms===

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.

An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing &quot;output&quot; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

===Automata theory===

Automata theory is the study of &quot;abstract machines&quot; and &quot;automata&quot;, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under discrete mathematics (a section of mathematics and also of computer science). &quot;Automata&quot; comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning &quot;self-acting&quot;.

Automata Theory is the study of self-operating virtual machines to help in the logical understanding of input and output process, without or with intermediate stage(s) of computation (or any function/process).

===Coding theory===

Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error correction and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines – such as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, and computer science – for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the transmitted data.

===Computational complexity theory===

Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.

===Computational geometry===

Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms that can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. 

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from mathematical visualization.

Other important applications of computational geometry include robotics (motion planning and visibility problems), geographic information systems (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), integrated circuit design (IC geometry design and verification), computer-aided engineering (CAE) (mesh generation), computer vision (3D reconstruction).

===Computational learning theory===

Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning. In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some 
useful way. For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible. The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and 
uses them to induce a classifier. This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples including the samples that have never been previously seen by the algorithm. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.

===Computational number theory===

Computational number theory, also known as algorithmic number theory, is the study of algorithms for performing number theoretic computations. The best known problem in the field is integer factorization.

===Cryptography===

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries). More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of adversaries and that are related to various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

===Data structures===

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, databases use B-tree indexes for small percentages of data retrieval and compilers and databases use dynamic hash tables as look up tables.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Storing and retrieving can be carried out on data stored in both main memory and in secondary memory.

===Distributed computation===

Distributed computing studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications, and blockchain networks like Bitcoin.

A computer program that runs in a distributed system is called a distributed program, and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs. There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including RPC-like connectors and message queues. An important goal and challenge of distributed systems is location transparency.

===Information-based complexity===

Information-based complexity (IBC) studies optimal algorithms and computational complexity for continuous problems. IBC has studied continuous problems as path integration, partial differential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations, nonlinear equations, integral equations, fixed points, and very-high-dimensional integration.

===Formal methods===

Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematics based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.

Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

===Information theory===

Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science involving the quantification of information. Information theory was developed by Claude E. Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in statistics, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, anomaly detection and other forms of data analysis.

Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include lossless data compression (e.g. ZIP files), lossy data compression (e.g. MP3s and JPEGs), and channel coding (e.g. for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)). The field is at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, neurobiology, and electrical engineering. Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the Internet, the study of linguistics and of human perception, the understanding of black holes, and numerous other fields. Important sub-fields of information theory are source coding, channel coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory, information-theoretic security, and measures of information.

===Machine learning===

Machine learning is a scientific discipline that deals with the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.

Machine learning can be considered a subfield of computer science and statistics. It has strong ties to artificial intelligence and optimization, which deliver methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based algorithms is infeasible. Example applications include spam filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining, although that focuses more on exploratory data analysis. Machine learning and pattern recognition &quot;can be viewed as two facets of 
the same field.&quot;

===Natural computation===
===Parallel computation===

Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved &quot;in parallel&quot;. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

Parallel computer programs are more difficult to write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

The maximum possible speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is known as Amdahl&#x27;s law.

===Programming language theory and program semantics===

Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features. It falls within the discipline of theoretical computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically legal strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will execute on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.

===Quantum computation===

A quantum computer is a computation system that makes direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on transistors. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses qubits (quantum bits), which can be in superpositions of states. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer. Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with non-deterministic and probabilistic computers; one example is the ability to be in more than one state simultaneously. The field of quantum computing was first introduced by Yuri Manin in 1980 and Richard Feynman in 1982. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum space–time in 1968.

Experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits. Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis.

===Symbolic computation===

Computer algebra, also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on numerical computation with approximate floating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizes &quot;exact&quot; computation with expressions containing variables that have not any given value and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of &quot;symbolic computation&quot;).

Software applications that perform symbolic calculations are called &quot;computer algebra systems&quot;, with the term &quot;system&quot; alluding to the complexity of the main applications that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a user interface for the input/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of routines to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, differentiation using chain rule, polynomial factorization, indefinite integration, etc.

===Very-large-scale integration===

Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.

<doc id="323396" wikidata="Q2323190" url="?curid=323396" title="Andrew Marr">
<text>Andrew William Stevenson Marr (born 31 July 1959) is a British journalist, author, broadcaster and presenter. Beginning his career as a political commentator at &quot;The Scotsman,&quot; he subsequently edited &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper from 1996 to 1998 and was political editor of BBC News from 2000 to 2005.

In 2002, Marr took over as host of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running &quot;Start the Week&quot; Monday morning discussion programme. He began hosting a political programme—&quot;Sunday AM&quot;, later called &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;—on Sunday mornings on BBC One in September 2005.

In 2007, he presented &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of Modern Britain&quot;, a BBC Two documentary series on the political history of post-war Britain, which was followed by a prequel in 2009, &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s The Making of Modern Britain&quot;, focusing on the period between 1901 and 1945. In September 2012, Marr began presenting &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of the World&quot;, a series examining the history of human civilisation.

After suffering a stroke in January 2013, Andrew Marr spent two months in hospital before returning to his role as presenter of &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; in September of that year. Marr departed the BBC in December 2021, and in 2022 he launched his own regular programmes on LBC, &quot;Tonight with Andrew Marr,&quot; and Classic FM. Additionally, he became Political Editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

==Early life==
Marr was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 31 July 1959 to Donald Marr, an investment trust manager, and his wife Valerie. Regarding his upbringing, he has said: &quot;My family are religious and go to church... [a]nd I went to church as a boy&quot;. His father was an elder in the local Church of Scotland, in Longforgan, which Marr grew up in. Marr was educated in Scotland at Craigflower Preparatory School, the independent High School of Dundee; and at Loretto School, also a private school, in Musselburgh, East Lothian, where he was a member of Pinkie House and a prefect. He went to read English at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating with a first class honours degree.

Regarding his political affiliations, he was formerly a Maoist and a member of the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory, a left-wing pressure group founded by Labour Party members, now known as the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty. His interest in Mao Zedong began as early as age eleven, when he gave fellow Craigflower School students copies of the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; that he had requested and received from the Chinese embassy. His affinity for Maoism continued into his time at Cambridge, where Marr says he was a &quot;raving leftie&quot; who acquired the nickname &quot;Red Andy&quot;.

==Print career==
Marr joined &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as a trainee and junior business reporter in 1981. In 1984, he moved to London where he became a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, and then a political correspondent in 1986. Marr met the political journalist Anthony Bevins, who became his mentor and close friend. Bevins was responsible for Marr&#x27;s first appointment at &quot;The Independent&quot; as a member of the newspaper&#x27;s launch staff, also in 1986.

Marr left shortly afterwards, and joined &quot;The Economist&quot;, where he contributed to the weekly &quot;Bagehot&quot; political column and ultimately became the magazine&#x27;s political editor in 1988. Marr has remarked that his time at &quot;The Economist&quot; &quot;changed me quite a lot&quot; and &quot;made me question a lot of my assumptions&quot;.

Marr returned to &quot;The Independent&quot; as the newspaper&#x27;s political editor in 1992, and became its editor in 1996 during a particularly turbulent time at the paper. Faced with price cutting by the Murdoch-owned &quot;Times&quot;, sales had begun to decline, and Marr made two attempts to arrest the slide. He made use of bold &#x27;poster-style&#x27; front pages, and then in 1996 radically re-designed the paper along a mainland European model, with Gill Sans headline fonts, and stories being grouped together by subject matter, rather than according to strict news value. This tinkering ultimately proved disastrous. With a limited advertising budget, the re-launch struggled for attention, then was mocked for reinterpreting its original marketing slogan &#x27;It Is – Are You&#x27; to read &#x27;It&#x27;s changed – have you?&#x27;.

At the beginning of 1998, Marr was dismissed, according to one version of events, for having refused to reduce the newspaper&#x27;s production staff to just five subeditors. According to Nick Cohen&#x27;s account, the sacking was due to the intervention of Alastair Campbell, director of communications for Tony Blair. Campbell had demanded that David Montgomery, the paper&#x27;s publisher, dismiss Marr over an article in which he had compared Blair with his predecessor John Major. This article had followed an earlier one by Blair published in &quot;The Sun&quot;, in which Blair had written: &quot;On the day we remember the legend that St George slayed a dragon to protect England, some will argue that there is another dragon to be slayed: Europe.&quot; Marr&#x27;s response asserted that Blair had spoken in bad faith, opportunistically championing Europe to pro-EU audiences while criticising it to anti-EU ones; and that the phrase &quot;some will argue&quot; was Blair&#x27;s disingenuous rhetorical ruse to distance himself from the xenophobic appeal that he himself was making.

Three months later, Marr returned to &quot;The Independent&quot;. Tony O&#x27;Reilly had increased his stake in the paper and bought out owners, the Mirror Group. O&#x27;Reilly, who had a high regard for Marr, asked him to collaborate as co-editor with Rosie Boycott, in an arrangement whereby Marr would edit the comment pages, and Boycott would have overall control of the news pages.

Many pundits predicted the arrangement would not last and two months later, Boycott left to replace Richard Addis as editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Marr was sole editor again, but only for one week. Simon Kelner, who had worked on the paper when it was first launched, accepted the editorship and asked Marr to stay on as a political columnist. Kelner was not Marr&#x27;s &quot;cup of tea&quot;, Marr observed later, and he left the paper for the last time in May 1998.

Marr was then a columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. Marr presented a three-part television series shown on BBC Two from 31 January to 2 February 2000 after &quot;Newsnight&quot;. A state-of-the-nation reflection, &quot;The Day Britain Died&quot; (2000) also had an accompanying book. Among Marr&#x27;s other publications is &quot;My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism&quot; (2004).

In 2021, he joined the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as its chief political commentator.

== Broadcast career ==
===BBC===
====Political editor====
Marr was appointed as the BBC&#x27;s political editor in May 2000. During his time as political editor, Marr assumed various presentational roles.

Marr made cameo appearances in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;Aliens of London&quot; and &quot;World War Three&quot;.

In April 2003, after Baghdad was captured by the invading forces during the Iraq War, Marr said on the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;: &quot;It would be entirely ungracious, even for [Tony Blair&#x27;s] critics, not to acknowledge that tonight he stands as a larger man and a stronger prime minister as a result&quot;.

Marr announced in 2005 that following the 2005 general election, he would step down as political editor to spend more time with his family. He was succeeded as political editor by Nick Robinson.

====&quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; and other programmes====
In September 2005, he moved to a new role presenting the BBC&#x27;s Sunday morning flagship news programme &quot;Sunday AM&quot;, known as &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; since September 2007; the slot was previously filled by &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; and hosted by Sir David Frost. Marr also presented the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Start the Week&quot; until his illness in 2013, and he returned as the programme&#x27;s regular host until he left the BBC.

In May and June 2007, the BBC broadcast &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of Modern Britain&quot;. He presented the series of five one-hour documentaries chronicling the history of Britain from 1945 to 2007. Unsold copies of the book of the series, a best-seller, were recalled in March 2009 by publishers Macmillan when legal action was taken over false claims that domestic violence campaigner Erin Pizzey had been a member of The Angry Brigade terrorist group. According to her own account, in a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview in 2001, Pizzey had been present at a meeting when they discussed their intention of bombing Biba, a fashion store, and threatened to report their activities to the police. Damages were paid to Pizzey and Marr&#x27;s book was republished with the error removed.

In 2008, he presented the prime time BBC One series &quot;Britain From Above&quot;. The following year, he contributed a three-part series called &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; to the BBC Darwin Season, celebrating the bicentenary of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his theory of evolution.

In late 2009, BBC Two broadcast his six-part television series on British politics in the first half of the 20th century &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s The Making of Modern Britain.&quot;

In September 2009 on the Sunday before the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Marr interviewed Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Towards the end of the interview, Marr told Brown he wanted to ask about:

The Prime Minister responded: &quot;No. I think this is the sort of questioning which is all too often entering the lexicon of British politics.&quot; Marr was later heavily criticised by Labour politicians, the media and fellow political journalists for what was described as a vague question which relied on its source being a single entry on a political blog. In a later interview with Krishnan Guru-Murthy of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, John Ward, the author of the Not Born Yesterday blog, stated that he had no proof to back up the claim.

In 2010, Marr presented a series, &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s Megacities&quot;, examining the life, development and challenges of some of the largest cities in the world.

In early 2012, Marr presented &quot;The Diamond Queen&quot;, a three-part TV series on BBC One looking at the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II in the run-up to the main celebrations of her Diamond Jubilee.

In 2012, Marr presented an eight-part series on BBC One entitled &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of the World&quot;, in conjunction with the Open University.

Following the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on 8 April 2013, Marr narrated a memorial documentary, &quot;Margaret Thatcher: Prime Minister&quot;.

On an 8 April 2018, BBC Sunday news programme Marr said &quot;lots of Palestinian kids&quot; were killed by Israeli forces. The journalist and campaigner Jonathan Sacerdoti complained that the statement was misleading and false. BBC management ruled that Marr breached editorial guidelines, that the statement lacked any evidence and &quot;risked misleading audiences on a material point&quot;.

Marr portrayed himself in the 2018 BBC series &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, interviewing Keeley Hawes&#x27; character Julie Montague, and wrote an opinion piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; about his decision to do so.

On 1 December 2019, Marr interviewed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and discussed Islamic terrorist Usman Khan, perpetrator of the 2019 London Bridge stabbing. Marr claimed the government had done nothing since 2010 to tighten the rules on sentencing for terrorist offences, implying that Johnson could have stopped Khan&#x27;s early release. In reality, Johnson&#x27;s government had lengthened the minimum early release, and in Khan&#x27;s case any legislation would have need to be retrospective anyhow. The BBC Editorial Complaints Unit therefore found that Marr had misled viewers on two counts.

===Global===
On 19 November 2021, Marr announced that he was leaving the BBC and joining Global in 2022 to host a new opinion programme on LBC called &quot;Tonight with Andrew Marr&quot;, host a new arts and interview programme on Classic FM, present a new weekly podcast on Global Player, and write a regular column for the LBC&#x27;s website. He said, &quot;Coming to Global gives me a new freedom to do fast-paced very regular political journalism on LBC with no filter in entirely my own voice&quot;. His first LBC show aired on 7 March 2022.

==Politics==
Marr has written about the need to remain impartial and &quot;studiously neutral&quot; whilst delivering news reports and &quot;convey fact, and nothing more&quot;. At an October 2006 BBC seminar discussing impartiality, Marr highlighted alleged bias within the BBC. He stated: &quot;The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It&#x27;s a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities, and gay people. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.&quot; 

In May 2021, Marr spoke about his frustration at having to maintain his impartiality at the BBC and not being able to speak in his own voice. He said: &quot;I think it will be very, very hard for people like me to carry on being completely neutral and completely &quot;sotto voce&quot; all the way through that ... At some point, I want to get out and use my own voice again.&quot;

In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in 2007, he said that he was a libertarian when discussing his conflicting views on smoking bans. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1999, he defined himself as a &quot;pampered white liberal&quot; and said that:
In March 2014, Marr was criticised for allegedly expressing his own opinion on an independent Scotland&#x27;s membership of the EU while interviewing Scottish politician Alex Salmond on BBC Television.

In the &quot;New Statesman&quot; during 2015, Marr expressed the opinion that the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be electable and that Conservative leaders recognise this. Marr wrote, &quot;Here and now, in 2015, we know diddly-squat.&quot; At that time Marr considered a Labour election victory under Corbyn unlikely.

In an interview in 2022, Marr described himself as &quot;a fairly centrist social democrat&quot;. Marr has expressed qualified support for Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership of the Labour Party.

==Other work==
Marr has helped support Sense, the National Deafblind and Rubella Association, and was the face of a Sense direct marketing appeal. He was President of the Galapagos Conservation Trust until 2013. In 2007 and 2014, Marr supported the charity iDE UK in the BBC Radio 4 Appeal and subsequently became a patron. His novels include &quot;Head of State&quot; (2014) and &quot;Children of the Master&quot; (2015).

==Personal life==
In August 1987, Marr married Jackie Ashley, a fellow political journalist, in Surrey. She is a daughter of the Labour life peer, Lord Ashley of Stoke (1922–2012). The couple have a son and two daughters. Marr lives in Primrose Hill in north London, having moved there from East Sheen in 2013.

When asked about his religious views, Marr has said, &quot;Am I religious? No. Do I believe in anything? No. I just don&#x27;t have that bump&quot;, and has described himself as &quot;an irreligious Calvinist&quot;.

===Health===
On 8 January 2013, Marr was taken to hospital after suffering a stroke at home. He left hospital on 3 March and said he hoped to return to work later in the year. He appeared as a guest on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; on 14 April and returned twice to interview David Miliband and the prime minister, David Cameron, before it was announced that he would return to presenting the show on 1 September 2013.

In May 2018, Marr went into hospital for an operation to deal with a malignant tumour on his kidney. He was expected to make a full recovery.

===Privacy injunction===
On 28 June 2008, Richard Ingrams reported in &quot;The Independent&quot; that Marr had been granted a High Court &quot;super-injunction&quot; preventing disclosure in the media of &quot;private&quot; information, or the existence of the injunction. &quot;Private Eye&quot; had revealed the existence of the injunction earlier in the week, having successfully challenged the need for its existence to be kept secret.

On 26 April 2011, following legal action by &quot;Private Eye&quot; editor Ian Hislop, an interview with Marr was published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, in which he revealed that the super-injunction had covered the reporting of an extra-marital affair with a female journalist. Hislop had filed a court challenge earlier in April 2011, and described the super-injunction as &quot;pretty rank&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1995, he was named Columnist of the Year at both the &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; Awards and the British Press Awards, and received the Journalist Award in the Channel 4 Political Awards of 2001.

Marr has received two British Academy Television Awards: the Richard Dimbleby Award at the 2004 ceremony and the award for Best Specialist Factual Programme (for his &quot;History of Modern Britain&quot;) at the 2008 ceremony.

Marr was awarded an honorary doctorate from Staffordshire University in 2009.

<doc id="323400" wikidata="Q624661" url="?curid=323400" title="Electronic (band)">
<text>Electronic were an English alternative dance supergroup formed by singer/guitarist Bernard Sumner (of New Order) and guitarist Johnny Marr (of the Smiths). They co-wrote the majority of their output between 1989 and 1998, collaborating with Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys on three tracks in their early years, and former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos on nine songs in 1995.

==History==
The two first met in 1984 when the Smiths guitarist contributed to a Quando Quango track that Sumner was producing. Later in 1988, Sumner was frustrated because his New Order bandmates were not receptive to his desire to add synth programming to their music. He decided to produce a solo album but found that he did not enjoy working alone, so he called Marr for help.

Inspired by contemporary dance music like Italo house and acts such as Technotronic, their initial concept was to release white label records on Factory and remain an anonymous entity, in contrast to their considerable reputations with The Smiths and New Order. The track &quot;Lucky Bag&quot; and the name Electronic itself are two of the vestiges of this initial approach. 

The fruits of this union became &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;, Electronic&#x27;s debut single which was released in December 1989 and sold around 350,000 copies. The drums on this record were played by ABC&#x27;s David Palmer and the string arrangement was written by Anne Dudley. It was a Top 40 hit in America the following spring and they toured in support for Depeche Mode in August 1990. After this success, Sumner and Marr took a more commercial direction, blending synthesizers, guitars and analogue technology while retaining the template of contemporary alternative rock.

== Albums ==

===&quot;Electronic&quot;===
After a year of intensive recording (and 18 months after &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;), the debut album &quot;Electronic&quot; was released to critical acclaim and domestic commercial success, featuring the Top 10 single &quot;Get the Message&quot; and another Top 40 single, &quot;Feel Every Beat&quot;. The album sold over a million copies worldwide.

Along with its fusion of rock and pop, Electronic continued their interest in dance music by inviting DJs to remix their singles and album tracks; this was a trend that continued throughout their career. Prominent acts that worked on Electronic songs around this period include Danny Rampling, DNA, Dave Shaw and Quando Quango founder and Haçienda DJ Mike Pickering.

After the first album was released and promoted, Marr and Sumner recorded albums with the The and New Order respectively, regrouping with Neil Tennant in 1992 to record their fourth and highest-charting single &quot;Disappointed&quot;.

===&quot;Raise the Pressure&quot;===
Electronic was resumed when these activities ended, and work began on the second album in late 1994. The core duo was joined by Karl Bartos, ex-percussionist and songwriter with Kraftwerk.

&quot;Raise the Pressure&quot; was released in July 1996 on the Parlophone label in the UK and Warner Bros. Like its predecessor it fused dance music with a guitar-led approach, but some reviewers felt its production was too rich and distracted from the songs. The album spawned two guitar oriented singles, &quot;Forbidden City&quot; [UK #14] and &quot;For You&quot; [UK #16], with the dancier &quot;Second Nature&quot; issued in February 1997 and reaching UK #35.

===&quot;Twisted Tenderness&quot;===
Electronic did not promote &quot;Raise the Pressure&quot; with a tour, although they performed its singles live on television shows including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. Instead, they chose to swiftly record their third album. This was to be a reaction to the length of time they spent producing &quot;Raise the Pressure&quot;, with an emphasis on writing and demoing songs quickly before recording them. Marr and Sumner were joined by Doves bassist Jimi Goodwin and Black Grape drummer Ged Lynch, and together they made the album &quot;Twisted Tenderness&quot; as a more conventional four-piece group. The album did not return the group to their early 1990s levels of popularity but was well received by critics.

===Current status===
Neither Sumner nor Marr has gone on record with any formal dissolution of the band despite both having moved on to other projects. However, in 2003, Marr did agree that the band had reached &quot;its natural conclusion&quot; and that he was happy that it ended on a positive note. Sumner returned with New Order shortly after the final album was released, and in 2009, formed a new band, Bad Lieutenant. Marr has since worked with many acts, including The Healers, Pet Shop Boys, The Cribs and Modest Mouse, as well as releasing several solo albums.

Marr and Sumner played with Doves for the Manchester v Cancer charity concert in January 2006 and the compilation album &quot;Get the Message – The Best of&quot; was released that September to mild promotion and sales [UK #194]. In July 2013 Sumner joined Marr at Jodrell Bank to perform &quot;Getting Away With It&quot;. Marr was supporting for New Order and performing songs from his career.

<text>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) is a toy robot accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was key to the NES&#x27;s launch in October 1985, as a redesign of the which had been launched in July 1985 in Japan for Famicom. Its short lifespan yielded only two games in the &quot;Robot Series&quot;: &quot;Gyromite&quot; and &quot;Stack-Up&quot;.

Following the North American video game crash of 1983, Nintendo alleviated that fearful retail market by rebranding its Japanese Famicom video game console as the Nintendo Entertainment System—a new platform focused on R.O.B. to further reclassify the system as a uniquely sophisticated toy experience instead of simply as a video game console. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; called R.O.B. &quot;the world&#x27;s only interactive robot&quot;.

The NES&#x27;s extensive marketing plan immediately and successfully centered on R.O.B., with the October 1985 test market launch in Manhattan, New York. This was Nintendo&#x27;s debut in the North American video game console market, which eventually revitalized the entire video game industry. R.O.B. was quietly discontinued a few years later, and became remembered as a successful Trojan Horse of marketing. He is a cameo or playable character in many Nintendo games such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==History==
===Development===
The new Nintendo of America subsidiary, having already successfully bet its own launch upon its conversion of its failed &quot;Radar Scope&quot; (1980) arcade game cabinets into the successful new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) arcade game, wanted to debut in the home video game console market using the Japanese parent company&#x27;s successful Famicom system. But the entire American video game industry, which had been devastated by the video game crash of 1983, first needed a relaunch.

Following the crash, many retailers had lost confidence in the Atari-led video game market even while the toy market was strong. With a high volume of low quality products and dead-inventory shovelware, some retailers and industry critics considered video gaming to be a passing fad altogether. Therefore, Nintendo spent much of 1984 re-conceiving its Family Computer (Famicom) platform from Japan to be portrayed in America not as a traditional video game console, but as a new kind of sophisticated entertainment experience.

Nintendo saw the industry&#x27;s overwhelming trend away from game consoles and toward home computers, but its prototype of a lavish Famicom-based home computer and multimedia package called Advanced Video System (AVS) was poorly received at the January 1985 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, so that was redesigned into a cost-reduced toy motif. The Famicom&#x27;s whimsical appearance was again rebranded with a serious naming and industrial design language similar to the AVS, called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The NES is based on the Control Deck game console, which is shaped like high-tech videophile equipment with a front-loaded and door-enclosed cartridge port in the style of the modern VCR instead of a typically top-loaded &quot;video game console&quot;.

The Family Computer Robot, a recent niche entry in the Famicom&#x27;s aftermarket accessory lineup in Japan on July 26, 1985, is a mechanized toy robot with working arms and crude eyesight, resembling &quot;a cross between E.T. and R2-D2&quot;. It was designed and patented by veteran Nintendo designer Gunpei Yokoi. Used as a functional companion for playing select video games within a custom playset, it was recolored for the NES and was thrust forth as essential to the NES&#x27;s new identity as a futuristic, robot-powered experience. &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; said, &quot;The key to the NES is the interactive robot ... You no longer have to fight only the aliens on the screen; you have a robot to contend with as well.&quot; &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; called it &quot;the world&#x27;s only interactive robot&quot;, because no other video game system or home computer package ever had one, greatly distinguishing the NES to retailers and consumers alike.

Nintendo of America staff received the first R.O.B. shipment from Japan, initially thrilled with anticipation while unboxing and using the robot. Howard Phillips remembered, &quot;The technology was so cool! [...] like voodoo magic [...] But then his actual motion was just hysterically slow.&quot; Nintendo marketing executive Gail Tilden recalled, &quot;That thing was definitely like watching grass grow. It was so slow, and to try and stand there and sales-pitch it in person and try to make it exciting; you had to have the eyes lined up just right or it wouldn&#x27;t receive the flashes. It was kind of a challenge.&quot; Product designer Don James laughed, &quot;[&quot;Gyromite&quot;] was hard as hell! [...] So you really had to think two or three moves ahead to allow him to do what he was going to do. But it&#x27;s cool to look at, right? [...] It was a really neat, unusual little device. And it was fun to play! But again, like Rock &#x27;em Sock &#x27;em Robots, I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it for 40 hours.&quot; Tasked with all of the NES&#x27;s naming and branding, the sole marketing staff member Gail Tilden said the name was &quot;originally going to be OTTO, which was a play on the word &#x27;auto&#x27;&quot;, but she settled on Robotic Operating Buddy, or R.O.B.

As the centerpiece of the new NES platform, R.O.B. was revealed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1985. Nintendo&#x27;s brochure for attracting distributors shows a prototypical hybrid between AVS and NES with R.O.B., saying, &quot;The future of home entertainment is staring you in the face. Our new video robot is the first of a long line of winners to come from Nintendo.&quot; and that R.O.B. is the &quot;star of a new Entertainment System that&#x27;s programmed to make you rich&quot;. The robotic persona reportedly &quot;worked like a charm&quot; to drive intrigued visitors to Nintendo&#x27;s booth, but nobody signed up to be a distributor of the upcoming NES.

&quot;IGN&quot; reflected that &quot;[R.O.B.] might have been the key to getting the system into players&#x27; hands, and once they had players, Nintendo was convinced the rest would be easy.&quot;

===Release===
Nintendo anticipated that R.O.B.&#x27;s flair for futurism, personality, and physicality was so crucial to the success of the NES, that the toy was featured prominently in much of the advertising media of the system and its game library, even more than any particular game and even with only one robot game. The robot was portrayed as a bridge between the player and the game. The retail floor displays were each topped with a huge R.O.B. head model, and the launch party centered on a colossal robot replica with many small silver-plated robot models. The toy robot is the highlighted accessory within the first and most premium NES consumer product offering, the Deluxe Set boxed bundle of Control Deck, R.O.B., Zapper light gun, &quot;Gyromite&quot;, and &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;.

The NES was launched as the Deluxe Set, in the October 1985 test market of New York City, then in further test markets including Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco, and finally nationwide. The NES&#x27;s design language with R.O.B. and the Zapper, recategorized the retailers&#x27; perception of the NES from a video game to a toy. This bypassed the crashed video game stigma and launched it more safely from the toy sections of retail stores next to established hit robot toys like Transformers, Voltron, Go-Bots, Teddy Ruxpin, and Lazer Tag.

Soon in 1985 came the second and final entry in the &quot;Robot Series&quot;, &quot;Stack-Up&quot;, packaged separately along with its own physical game pieces. The NES was soon sold much more popularly in the form of only the Control Deck and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; — without R.O.B. Optionally, &quot;Gyromite&quot; was repackaged separately, and R.O.B. was repackaged separately for . In the following few years, R.O.B. and the two-game &quot;Robot Series&quot; were quietly discontinued.

==Hardware==

The patent underlying the R.O.B. product was filed by Gunpei Yokoi as &quot;photosensing video game control system&quot;, with the same optical electronics as a Zapper, and likewise only functions correctly with a cathode-ray tube (CRT) television and not an LCD. Games can send six distinct commands to R.O.B. by flashing the screen. The test feature within &quot;Gyromite&quot; and &quot;Stack-Up&quot; sends an optical flash that should activate R.O.B.&#x27;s red light.

==Games==
Only two officially licensed games were published for R.O.B., which comprise Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Robot Series&quot;: Gyromite and Stack-Up. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; reported Nintendo&#x27;s supposed plans as stated prior to CES June 1985, for four more nondescript &quot;Robot Series&quot; games, but they were never released.

===&quot;Gyromite&quot;===

The &quot;Gyromite&quot; retail package consists of the following items: two claws for R.O.B.&#x27;s hands; two heavy spinning tops called gyros; two red and blue trays upon which the gyros will rest, causing buttons to be pressed on the second NES controller; one spinner motor for accelerating the gyros; and two black trays upon which the gyros are stored when not in use. The Direct game mode is a feature used to learn how to use R.O.B. or to play with R.O.B. without playing the game. &quot;Gyromite&quot; is a puzzle platform video game in which main character Professor Hector must collect dynamite before the time runs out, with his path blocked by several red and blue pillars and by dinosaur-like creatures called Smicks. Hector cannot jump, so he can only collect dynamite by descending upon it. He can collect radishes that attract the Smicks when dropped. In Game A, the commands are made by pressing START and then pushing the direction in which to move R.O.B., and using the A and B buttons to open and close his arms. If R.O.B. places a gyro on the red or blue button, it pushes the A or B button on the second NES controller, moving the pillar of the corresponding color. If both buttons need to be pressed at the same time, the gyros are placed in a spinner so that they will stay balanced on the button without R.O.B. holding it. Game B has the same controls, except that START does not need to be pressed to make R.O.B. accept a command.

===&quot;Stack-Up&quot;===

&quot;Stack-Up&quot; comes with five trays, five different colored circular blocks, and two claws worn by R.O.B. for grabbing the blocks. Again, the player controls Professor Hector. In the Direct game mode, the player makes the block stack match with the one shown on screen by moving Hector to the button that corresponds to the desired movement. In Memory, the player makes a list of commands to recreate the displayed block setup, and then R.O.B. executes the list. In Bingo, the player makes the shown block stack, where the color of the block does not matter. There are two enemies: one causes the player to lose a life, and the other makes R.O.B. perform undesired actions.

===Aftermarket===
In 2014, independent game developer Retrozone produced a limited release NES cartridge titled &quot;8-Bit X-Mas 2014&quot;. The title screen features R.O.B. character graphics, and interacts with the toy by making it dance to Christmas music.

==Reception==
In January 1986, an independent research firm commissioned by Nintendo delivered a survey of 200 NES owners, showing that the most popular given reason for buying an NES was because children wanted the robot—followed by good graphics, variety of games, and the uniqueness and newness of the NES package. The creation and marketing of R.O.B. as a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; after the video game crash of 1983 was placed fifth in GameSpy&#x27;s twenty-five smartest moves in gaming history. Yahoo! ranked R.O.B. as one of the craziest video game controllers and lamented that the peripheral only worked with two games.

By 1987, the two-year-old R.O.B. and &quot;Robot Series&quot; had received none of Nintendo&#x27;s promised updates while the rest of the NES&#x27;s library had exploded with classic flagship franchise-building hits like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Metroid&quot;. In 1987, Mark Seeley of &quot;Crash!&quot; magazine visited a toy fair in England to observe a playthrough of &quot;Gyromite&quot; with R.O.B., saying of the struggling demonstrator that he had &quot;never seen anything so complicated and difficult in all my life&quot;. In July 1987, &quot;Family Computing&quot; magazine advocated buying the much cheaper and more entertaining setup of the Control Deck and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; instead of R.O.B., saying, &quot;Anyone who has seen a Nintendo ad on television would think that R.O.B. is the heart of the system. Not so. R.O.B. is an ingenious idea [but] while R.O.B. is a cute little guy, there isn&#x27;t much you can do with him. ... [N]either [of his two games] generates much excitement.&quot;

In 2018, Owen S. Good of &quot;Polygon&quot; remembered his childhood experience with the vintage R.O.B. and assessed the setup as &quot;a novel, if almost Rube Goldberg-esque way of &#x27;playing&#x27; with its users ... that quickly got dull&quot;.

Historian Chris Kohler was unimpressed with the product&#x27;s long-term entertainment value. &quot;As video game controller peripherals go, R.O.B. was a particularly gimmicky one. Once the novelty of controlling a robot&#x27;s arms and spinning a glorified top had worn off, usually within days or even hours, R.O.B. got in the way of enjoyment. He required battery replacements too often, and it was immediately apparent that the maze barriers in &quot;Gyromite&quot; could be turned on and off just as easily by tapping the A and B buttons on a standard controller, which was all that R.O.B.&#x27;s complicated motions ended up doing.&quot;

In retrospect, Kohler considered R.O.B.&#x27;s discontinuation to have become immaterial because the product&#x27;s whole existence has ultimately amounted to &quot;merely a Trojan Horse to get NES systems into American homes&quot;. He said &quot;The gambit worked like a charm, and nobody missed R.O.B. or the Zapper once players realized that games played with the standard video game controller, like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, were much more fun.&quot;

===Legacy===
After many failures, the late addition of R.O.B. gave a key product distinction to the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System, reclassified the platform as a toy, and served as a Trojan Horse to enable the platform&#x27;s successful launch. This, in turn, secured the survival of Nintendo of America and revitalized the entire video game industry. A followup promotional poster from Nintendo simply pictured R.O.B. and said, &quot;They said reviving the video game market wasn&#x27;t humanly possible. It wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

R.O.B. has made cameo appearances in many video games, such as &quot;StarTropics&quot; (1990) for NES, &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; (2003), the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; (2015, 3DS), and the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series.

R.O.B. is an unlockable character in &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, each of which refers to R.O.B. as male. In &quot;Brawl&quot;″s adventure mode, The Subspace Emissary, R.O.B. plays a major role in the plot. As part of &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, R.O.B. has two Amiibo figurines, uniquely produced in both the gray and white NES color scheme and the red and white Famicom color scheme.

R.O.B. is the avatar for TASBot, a tool-assisted speedrun software bot for video games.

<text>The Wurzels are an English Scrumpy and Western band from Somerset, England, best known for their number one hit &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot; and number three hit &quot;I Am a Cider Drinker&quot; in 1976.

==Name==
The name of the band was dreamt up by founder Adge Cutler. It is short for mangelwurzel, a crop grown to feed livestock.

The Wurzels&#x27; particular &quot;genre&quot; of music was named Scrumpy and Western after the group&#x27;s first EP of the same name, issued early in 1967. Scrumpy is a name given to traditionally-made rough cider in southwest England.

==History==
===Adge Cutler and The Wurzels===

The Wurzels were formed in 1966 as a backing group for, and by, singer/songwriter Adge Cutler. The first recordings were made live in the Royal Oak Inn, Nailsea, Somerset, in December 1966. With a strong Somerset accent, Cutler played on his West Country roots, singing many folk songs with local themes such as cider-making (and -drinking), farming, dung-spreading, local villages and industrial work songs, often with a comic slant.

During the latter half of the 1960s, the band became popular regionally, and the release of the single &quot;Drink Up Thy Zider&quot; in 1966 led to national fame and it reaching number 45 in the UK Singles Chart. The B-side, &quot;Twice Daily&quot; was banned by the BBC for being too raunchy.

A number of live albums were recorded at local pubs and clubs, filled with Cutler-penned favourites such as &quot;Easton in Gordano&quot;, &quot;The Champion Dung Spreader&quot;, and &quot;Thee&#x27;s Got&#x27;n Where Thee Cassn&#x27;t Back&#x27;n, Hassn&#x27;t?&quot;, together with songs written by others and some re-workings of popular folk songs of the time.

Adge Cutler died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MGB sports car which then overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge. He was returning alone from a Wurzels show in Hereford in May 1974. He was buried in Nailsea.

===The Wurzels===
Cutler&#x27;s death marked a turning point in the history of the Wurzels. Deprived of the main song-writing talent, the remaining Wurzels recorded &quot;The Wurzels Are Scrumptious!&quot; in 1975, an album containing many favourites from the back catalogue, including a number of previously unrecorded Cutler-written songs. In order to continue the surviving band needed its own songs, and these mostly took the formula of re-written popular pop songs of the time with the lyrics changed to include the usual Wurzel themes (cider, farming, local villages, Cheddar cheese, etc.)

In 1976, the Wurzels released a cover version of &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot;, a rework of the song &quot;Brand New Key&quot;, by Melanie, which became a UK hit, topping the charts for two weeks. The band quickly followed its success with the release of a number of similarly themed songs such as &quot;I Am A Cider Drinker&quot; (a rework of Paloma Blanca which was written by and had been a hit for the George Baker Selection and also covered by Jonathan King the year before) which got to number three in the UK chart, and &quot;Farmer Bill&#x27;s Cowman&quot; (a reworking of the Whistling Jack Smith instrumental &quot;I Was Kaiser Bill&#x27;s Batman&quot;).

The Wurzels have never stopped performing, but record releases during the 1980s and 1990s were few — and included singles such as &quot;I Hate JR&quot; and &quot;Sunny Weston-super-Mare&quot;. To help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Eddie Stobart Ltd in 1995, the group signed to Cumbria record label Loose Records &amp; Music, and recorded four new songs including the single &quot;I Wanna Be An Eddie Stobart Driver&quot; (released as a limited edition lorry-shaped disc). The interest in this record sparked off renewed interest in The Wurzels.

The late 1990s saw the continuing of this revival of the fortunes for the surviving Wurzels, gaining a cult status amongst students and a resurgence in their popularity in their native West Country. Under the new management of The Stranglers manager Sil Willcox a number of CD releases followed, largely featuring re-recordings of older works, but also &quot;Never Mind The Bullocks, Ere&#x27;s The Wurzels&quot; containing cover versions of contemporary British rock songs. This album was recorded and produced by Louie Nicastro and George Allen. The album title and cover were a spoof of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;.

The Wurzels covered British Sea Power&#x27;s &quot;Remember Me&quot;, while British Sea Power covered The Wurzels&#x27; &quot;I Am A Cider Drinker&quot;. The band also supported BSP at their gig at the London Forum in November. In 2004, The Wurzels appeared on &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot; in that year&#x27;s Christmas special, performing Christmas songs to Bill Bailey&#x27;s team. (Bailey is a Wurzels fan, and stood and saluted upon hearing &quot;Combine Harvester&quot;, later claiming that he had the tune on his doorbell at home). In 2005, the band released a limited edition split single with British Sea Power.

In 2007, The Wurzels and Tony Blackburn re-released &quot;I Am A Cider Drinker&quot;, with the royalties from the song going to the BUI Prostate Cancer Care Appeal in Bristol.

The Wurzels continue to gig around the UK, including playing at the Shalbourne Festival for nearly 11 years, although they pulled out of the 2007 Glastonbury Festival, having been scheduled to play the bandstand stage where they could not use their own sound engineers, although they had played the same stage at the 2000 Glastonbury Festival. They were also one of the headliners at the 2007 Bristol Community Festival, and made a return to Glastonbury in 2008 (on a higher profile stage).

The Wurzels are also popular with supporters of Bristol City F.C. Their song &quot;One for the Bristol City&quot; is the official club anthem. First released in 1976, a newly recorded version of this song reached number 66 in the UK chart in September 2007. It was previously played at the final whistle at Ashton Gate if the home club won, and it is sung by fans along with other Wurzels songs &quot;I Am A Cider Drinker&quot; and “Drink Up Thy Zider”; the latter of which replaced “One For The Bristol City” as the song played following a win in 2010. The song has also been adopted by Bath City who, like Bristol City, played the track after home victories. The style of the band (Scrumpy and Western) also shared its name with Bristol City&#x27;s previous mascot, Scrumpy the Robin, and the band regularly perform following final home games of the season.

In addition, the band have become popular among fans of Bristol Bears since their move to Ashton Gate - also regularly playing at the end of a season, and another of their tracks (“The Blackbird”) is sung in the dressing room following every game, should the Bears be victorious.

In December 2009, they released a new single, available by internet download only — a first for the band, entitled &quot;Ode To Adge&quot; - a tribute to the band&#x27;s founder, Adge Cutler.

In June 2010, the Wurzels&#x27; released another single (a cover of the Kaiser Chiefs &quot;Ruby&quot;) and as another first in the band&#x27;s history, issued in preview form, together with a promotional film, on their YouTube channel. The original backing chorus refrain of &quot;aah aah aah&quot; was replaced by &quot;ooarr ooarr ooarr&quot;. The single was made available for general release only as an internet download (traditional hardcopies were made available as promo discs to radio stations). The same month the band released the album, &quot;A Load More Bullocks&quot; - timed to coincide with their appearance the previous Saturday at the Glastonbury Festival. Their session took place on the Avalon stage.

In 2011, BBC Four started a series of repeats of the popular long-running programme &quot;Top of The Pops&quot;, starting with 1976 and a programme dedicated to that year. Two of the Wurzels, Budd and Banner were interviewed as part of that programme with their first performance on the programme (1976) being screened. In the same month, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; included an item on the story of the &quot;Combine Harvester&quot; song, featuring further interviews with Budd and Banner and extracts from the 1976 promotional film.

In 2014, they released a new song &quot;The Mendip Windfarm Song&quot; inspired by a local protest about wind turbines being constructed near the Wurzel HQ in Laverton.

In 2015, the Wurzels teamed up with the Farm Safety Foundation with a rewrite of &quot;Combine Harvester&quot;, focussing on Farm Safety. The song was accompanied by a light-hearted video produced by students from Moreton Morrell College, drawing attention to the various dangers on the farm.

In February 2016, the band performed at Camden Market in London. The day after, the BBC released never before seen footage of the band from 1967, with Adge Cutler larking around in Bristol City Centre.

Prior to the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, the Wurzels had played shows two to three times a week for nearly 50 years.

The band were the subject of a Burst Radio celebration, &#x27;The Wurzels: From A to Z&#x27;, in November 2021.

<text>Joseph Rodman Drake (August 7, 1795 – September 21, 1820) was an early American poet.

== Biography ==
Born in New York City, he was orphaned when young and entered a mercantile house. While still a child, he showed a talent for writing poems. He was educated at Columbia College. In 1813 he began studying in a physician&#x27;s office. In 1816 he began to practice medicine and in the same year married Sarah, daughter of Henry Eckford, a naval architect.

In 1819, together with his friend and fellow poet Fitz-Greene Halleck, he wrote a series of satirical verses for the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, which were published under the penname &quot;The Croakers.&quot; Drake died of consumption a year later at the age of twenty-five.

As a writer, Drake is considered part of the &quot;Knickerbocker group&quot;, which also included Halleck, Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, James Kirke Paulding, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Robert Charles Sands, Lydia M. Child, and Nathaniel Parker Willis. A collection of poems by Joseph Rodman Drake, &quot;The Culprit Fay and Other Poems&quot;, was published posthumously by his daughter in 1835. His best-known poems are the long title-poem of that collection, and the patriotic &quot;The American Flag&quot; which was set as a cantata for two soloists, choir and orchestra by the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák in 1892-93. &quot;The Culprit Fay&quot; served as the inspiration for a 1908 orchestral rhapsody of the same name by Henry Kimball Hadley.

Fitz-Greene Halleck&#x27;s poem &quot;Green be the turf above thee&quot; was written as a memorial to Drake. Joseph Rodman Drake Park in Hunts Point, Bronx, a two-and-a-half-acre green space that contains his burial site in a small enclosed cemetery, was named for him in 1915. Buried here as well are members of the old local landowning families, notably the Hunts (&quot;Hunts Point&quot;), Leggetts, and Willets. This park has received $180,000 of New York State funding to memorialize slave workers who were thought to be buried there, and the remains of up to 11 enslaved Africans were rediscovered in 2013-14 by local students from P.S. 48, also known as the Joseph Rodman Drake School.

== Critical response ==
In the early 19th century Americans numbered Drake and his friend Halleck as two of the leading literary personalities and talents produced by their country, but their reputations were short-lived. In April 1836, Edgar Allan Poe published a review of their work–known to Poe scholars as &quot;The Drake-Halleck Review&quot;– in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; criticizing both, though he thought Drake the better of the two. Poe&#x27;s essay is as much a critique of the state of criticism at that time, objecting to the fact that &quot;at this particular moment there are no American poems held in so high estimation by our countrymen, as the poems of Drake, and of Halleck.&quot; Looking at Drake&#x27;s &quot;The Culprit Fay&quot;, a narrative poem of 640 lines, Poe found elements to praise but wrote that &quot;the greater part of it is utterly destitute of any evidence of imagination whatever&quot;. He found Drake capable of description, but offered his view that description required little poetic ability and provided his own alternatives to show how simple this writing was. For Drakes&#x27; lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
 He put his acorn helmet on;
 It was plumed of the silk of the thistle down:
 The corslet plate that guarded his breast
 Was once the wild bee&#x27;s golden vest;
 His cloak of a thousand mingled dyes,
 Was formed of the wings of butterflies;
 His shield was the shell of a lady-bug queen,
 Studs of gold on a ground of green;*
 And the quivering lance which he brandished bright
 Was the sting of a wasp he had slain in fight.&lt;/poem&gt;

Poe offered:
&lt;poem&gt;
 His blue-bell helmet, we have heard
 Was plumed with the down of the hummingbird,
 The corslet on his bosom bold
 Was once the locust&#x27;s coat of gold,
 His cloak, of a thousand mingled hues,
 Was the velvet violet, wet with dews,
 His target was, the crescent shell
 Of the small sea Sidrophel,
 And a glittering beam from a maiden&#x27;s eye
 Was the lance which he proudly wav&#x27;d on high.&lt;/poem&gt;

In Poe&#x27;s view this ability creates &quot;a species of vague wonder at the writer&#x27;s ingenuity&quot; in most readers, but Poe mocked it as an example of the &quot;sublimely ridiculous&quot; and &quot;puerilities&quot;, requiring the reader to &quot;imagine a race of Fairies in the vicinity of West Point&quot;.

<text>Alpenglow (from ; ) is an optical phenomenon that appears as a horizontal reddish glow near the horizon opposite to the Sun when the solar disk is just below the horizon.

==Description==
Strictly speaking, alpenglow refers to indirect sunlight reflected or diffracted by the atmosphere after sunset or before sunrise. This diffuse illumination creates soft shadows in addition to the reddish color. The term is also used informally to include direct illumination by the reddish light of the rising or setting sun, with sharply defined shadows.

===Reflected sunlight===
When the Sun is below the horizon, sunlight has no direct path to reach a mountain. Unlike the direct sunlight around sunrise or sunset, the light that causes alpenglow is reflected off airborne precipitation, ice crystals, or particulates in the lower atmosphere. These conditions differentiate between direct sunlight around sunrise or sunset and alpenglow.

The term is generally confused to be any sunrise or sunset light reflected off the mountains or clouds, but alpenglow in the strict sense of the word is not direct sunlight and is only visible after sunset or before sunrise.

After sunset, if mountains are absent, aerosols in the eastern sky can be illuminated in a similar way by the remaining scattered reddish light above the fringe of Earth&#x27;s shadow. This backscattered light produces a pinkish band opposite of the Sun&#x27;s direction, called the Belt of Venus.

===Direct sunlight===
Alpenglow in a looser sense may refer to any illumination by the rosy or reddish light of the setting or rising Sun.

<text>Jakob (or Jacob) Heine (April 16, 1800, Lauterbach, Black Forest, Holy Roman Empire – November 12, 1879, Cannstatt, Germany) was a German orthopaedist. He is most famous for his 1840 study into poliomyelitis, which was the first medical report on the disease, and the first time the illness was recognised as a clinical entity. Poliomyelitis is often known as &quot;Heine-Medin disease&quot;, after the work of Heine and Karl Oskar Medin.

Heine studied classical languages and theology before turning to medicine, a decision influenced by his uncle, Johann Georg Heine, who owned an orthopaedic institute in Würzburg. He was awarded a doctorate in 1827. In the 1830s, Jakob Heine opened an orthopaedic institution in Cannstatt near Stuttgart and served as director there until 1865. In his institution patients from all over Europe were treated. Heine&#x27;s special interests were scoliosis, clubfeet and paralysis of arms and legs. He also used washings and gymnastics as a therapy.

One of the sons he had with his wife Henriette Ludovike Camerer (1807–1884, married in 1831) was Carl Wilhelm Heine (1838–1877), one of the most famous European surgeons of the 19th century.

An honorary citizen of Cannstatt, Heine received the titles of &quot;Court counselor&quot; and &quot;Privy counselor&quot;, and was raised to the nobility with the Württembergian Order of the Crown.

Heine was also honoured at Warm Springs, Georgia, USA, where his bronze bust can be found along with those of other polio experts and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Polio Hall of Fame.

<doc id="323422" wikidata="Q770215" url="?curid=323422" title="Gaullism">
<text>Gaullism (, ) is a French political stance based on the thought and action of World War II French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle, who would become the founding President of the Fifth French Republic. De Gaulle withdrew French forces from the NATO Command Structure, forced the removal of allied (US) military bases from France, as well as initiated France&#x27;s own independent nuclear deterrent programme. His actions were predicated on the view that France would not be subordinate to other nations.

According to Serge Berstein, Gaullism is &quot;neither a doctrine nor a political ideology&quot; and cannot be considered either left or right. Rather, &quot;considering its historical progression, it is a pragmatic exercise of power that is neither free from contradictions nor of concessions to momentary necessity, even if the imperious word of the general gives to the practice of Gaullism the allure of a programme that seems profound and fully realised.&quot; Gaullism is &quot;a peculiarly French phenomenon, without doubt the quintessential French political phenomenon of the 20th century&quot;.

Lawrence D. Kritzman argues that Gaullism may be seen as a form of French patriotism in the tradition of Jules Michelet. He writes: &quot;Aligned on the political spectrum with the right, Gaullism was committed nevertheless to the republican values of the Revolution, and so distanced itself from the particularist ambitions of the traditional right and its xenophobic causes.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Gaullism saw as its mission the affirmation of national sovereignty and unity, which was diametrically opposed to the divisiveness created by the leftist commitment to class struggle.&quot;

Gaullism was nationalistic. In the early post-WWII period, Gaullists advocated for retaining the French Empire. De Gaulle shifted his stance on empire in the mid-1950s, suggesting potential federal arrangements or self-determination and membership in the French Community.

== History ==
Berstein writes that Gaullism has progressed in multiple stages:
*The first phase (1940–45) occurred during World War II. In this period, Gaullism is identified with those French who rejected the armistice with Nazi Germany and the Vichy collaborators led by Philippe Pétain, and joined with General Charles de Gaulle and the Free French Forces, who sought to put France back in the war on the Allied side.
* In the second phase (1946–1958), Gaullism was a type of opposition to the Fourth French Republic. Gaullists in this period challenged the unstable parliamentary government of the Fourth Republic and advocated its replacement with &quot;a president of the republic with preeminent constitutional powers.&quot;
* In the third phase (1958–69), &quot;Gaullism was nothing other than the support given to the general&#x27;s own politics after he returned to power in 1958 and served as president of the newly formed Fifth Republic from 1959 until his resignation in 1969.&quot;

Since 1969, Gaullism has been used to describe those identified as heirs to de Gaulle&#x27;s ideas. The Cross of Lorraine, used by the Resistant Free France (1940–1944) during World War II, has served as the symbol of many Gaullist parties and movements, including the Rally of the French People (1947–1955), the Union for the New Republic (1958–1967), or the Rally for the Republic (1976–2002).

== Principles ==

=== Strong state ===
The &quot;fundamental principle&quot; of Gaullism is a &quot;certain idea of France&quot; as a strong state. In his &quot;War Memoirs&quot;, de Gaulle describes France as &quot;an indomitable entity, a &#x27;person&#x27; with whom a mystical dialogue was maintained throughout history. The goal of Gaullism, therefore, is to give precedence to its interests, to ensure that the voice is heard, to make it respected, and to assure its survival … to remain worthy of its past, the nation must endow itself with a powerful state.&quot; Kritzman writes that &quot;the Gaullist idea of France set out to restore the honor of the nation and affirm its grandeur and independence&quot; with de Gaulle seeking to &quot;construct a messianic vision of France&#x27;s historic destiny, reaffirm its prestige in the world, and transcend the national humiliations of the past.&quot; Accordingly, de Gaulle urged French unity over divisive &quot;partisan quarrels&quot; and emphasized French heritage, including both the Ancien Régime and the Revolution. The French political figures most admired by de Gaulle &quot;were those responsible for national consensus—Louis XIV, Napoleon, Georges Clemenceau—who saw as their goal the creation of political and social unity by a strong state.&quot;

In order to strengthen France, Gaullists also emphasize the need for &quot;a strong economy and a stable society.&quot; Gaullism believes, according to Berstein, that &quot;it is the imperative of the state, as guardian of the national interest, to give impetus to economic growth and to guide it. Liberal opinion is accepted if it promises more efficiency than planning. As for social justice, so long as its natural distrust of big business can be allayed, it is less a matter of doctrine than a means of upholding stability. To put an end to class struggle, Gaullists hope to make use of participation, a nineteenth-century concept of which the general spoke frequently, but which he allowed his associates to ignore.&quot;

As part of a strong state, de Gaulle highlighted the necessity to found state institutions on a strong executive, contrasting with the French republican tradition, which emphasized the role of the elected assembly. During his time in office, de Gaulle sought to establish authority by holding direct universal votes and popular referendums and by directly engaging with the nation (via speeches broadcast over radio, press conferences, and trips to the provinces). Even though he frequently spoke on his respect for democracy, his political opponents perceived in his rule a tendency toward dictatorial power; many feared a Bonapartist revival or a republican monarchy. France remained a democracy, however, and de Gaulle&#x27;s decision to step down as president following voters&#x27; rejection of the April 1969 constitutional referendum showed that his commitment to democratic principles was not merely a rhetorical ploy.

=== French exceptionalism ===
In foreign policy, Gaullists are identified with both realism and French exceptionalism, and de Gaulle sought to impose French influence on the global order. Gaullists supported decolonization, which freed France from the burden of empire. This was reflected in de Gaulle&#x27;s resolution of the Algeria crisis (1954–1962), which was strongly influenced by de Gaulle&#x27;s realpolitik, or &quot;keen sense of political expediency.&quot; Realizing that decolonization was inevitable, and that a continued crisis and extended Algerian War would harm the French economy and perpetuate national disunity, &quot;de Gaulle felt that it was in France&#x27;s best interests to grant independence and desist from military engagement,&quot; thereby preserving French unity and grandeur.

Gaullists emphasize the need for France to &quot;guarantee its national independence without resorting to allies whose interests might not coincide with those of France.&quot; The development of independent French nuclear capability, undertaken at significant effort despite much international criticism, was an outgrowth of this worldview. However, de Gaulle simultaneously initiated one of the first international nonproliferation efforts by quietly unshackling and distancing the French program from a diplomatically troublesome secret involvement with an Israeli junior partner, attempting to demilitarize and open to international oversight the Israeli nuclear arms program.

France under de Gaulle sought to avoid a post-World War II bipolar global political order dominated by the two superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union, and sought to avoid dependence on the United States. Kritzman writes: &quot;Gaullist foreign policy was motivated by its need to distinguish itself from … the two great superpowers. Paradoxically, [de Gaulle] desired to be part of the Western alliance and be critical of it at the same time on key issues such as defense.&quot; Most notably, de Gaulle withdrew France from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military operations in 1966, and directed non-French NATO troops to leave France, although France remained a NATO member. Gaullists were also critical of the overseas economic influence of the U.S. and the role of the U.S. dollar in the international monetary system. Under de Gaulle, France established diplomatic relations with China earlier than most other Western nations; imposed an arms embargo against Israel (1967); and denounced American imperialism in the Third World.

De Gaulle and the Gaullists did not support Europe as a supranational entity, but did favour European integration in the form of &quot;a confederation of sovereign states mutually engaged in &quot;common policy, autonomous from the superpowers,&quot; and significantly influenced by France. De Gaulle&#x27;s hopes to advance this sort of union largely failed, however, &quot;in the face of the desire of the other European powers to remain closely allied to the United States.&quot;

== Political legacy after Charles de Gaulle ==
De Gaulle&#x27;s political legacy has been profound in France and has gradually influenced the entirety of the political spectrum. His successor as president, Georges Pompidou, consolidated Gaullism during his term from 1969 to 1974. Once-controversial Gaullist ideas have become accepted as part of the French political consensus and &quot;are no longer the focus of political controversy.&quot; For instance, the strong presidency was maintained by all of de Gaulle&#x27;s successors, including the socialist François Mitterrand (1981–1995). French independent nuclear capability and a foreign policy influenced by Gaullism–although expressed &quot;in more flexible terms&quot;–remains &quot;the guiding force of French international relations.&quot; During the 2017 presidential election, de Gaulle&#x27;s legacy was claimed by candidates ranging from the radical left to the radical right, including Jean-Luc Mélenchon, Benoît Hamon, Emmanuel Macron, François Fillon and Marine Le Pen.

According to Berstein, &quot;It is no exaggeration to say that Gaullism has molded post-war France. At the same time, considering that the essence of Gaullist ideas are now accepted by everyone, those who wish to be the legitimate heirs of de Gaulle (e.g., Jacques Chirac of the RPR) now have an identity crisis. It is difficult for them to distinguish themselves from other political perspectives.&quot; Not all Gaullist ideas have endured, however. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, there have been several periods of &quot;cohabitation&quot; (1986–1988, 1993–1995, 1997–2002), in which the president and prime minister have been from different parties, a marked shift from the &quot;imperial presidency&quot; of de Gaulle. De Gaulle&#x27;s economic policy, based on the idea of &quot;dirigisme&quot; (state stewardship of the economy), has also weakened. Although the major French banks, as well as insurance, telecommunications, steel, oil and pharmaceutical companies, were state-owned as recently as the mid-1980s, the French government has since then privatized many state assets.

== Currents ==

=== Traditional Gaullism ===
The term &quot;traditional Gaullism&quot; (&quot;Gaullisme traditionnel&quot;) has been used by scholars to describe the core values of Gaullism embodied by the actions and policies of Charles de Gaulle, generally in distinction with other Gaullist currents such as &quot;social Gaullism&quot; and &quot;neo-Gaullism&quot;.

Resistant Gaullism (&quot;Gaullisme de Résistance&quot;) emphasizes the need for French political and military independence from potentially hostile powers, inspired by de Gaulle&#x27;s role in the fight against Nazi Germany and Vichy France during World War II. The term &quot;first-generation Chiraquian Gaullism&quot; (&quot;Gaullisme chiraquien de première génération&quot;) has been used to describe politicians loyal to the populist stance and the opposition to European integration and the free market as initially advocated by Jacques Chirac in the late 1970s. This position was embodied in particular by Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin, who came to oppose Chirac&#x27;s shift to neo-Gaullism during the 1990s.

=== Social Gaullism ===
Social Gaullism, or &quot;left-wing Gaullism&quot;, focuses on the social dimensions of Gaullism, and has often been linked by scholars to social democracy. Opposed to the class conflict analysis of Marxism, which was perceived as a threat to national unity, de Gaulle advocated instead a &quot;capital-labour association&quot;, that is the need for the direct participation of workers in their company&#x27;s financial results and management, which he believed was a necessary condition for them to take an interest in its functioning and development. This aspect of Gaullism has been promoted by the Democratic Union of Labour between 1959 and 1967, and by politicians like René Capitant, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Jean Charbonnel, Léo Hamon, or Jean Mattéoli. More recently, the Citizen and Republican Movement and Jean-Pierre Chevènement took up the banner of left-Gaullism.

=== Neo-Gaullism ===
&quot;Neo-Gaullism&quot; has been used in the literature to describe a movement that emerged after the death of de Gaulle in 1970 and drew more influence from economic liberalism. Many aspects of neo-Gaullism, such as support for the Maastricht Treaty (1992) and French rapprochement with NATO under Chirac&#x27;s presidency, have been described as difficult to reconcile with the historical idea of Gaullism. However, key components of Gaullism have remained, including the concept of a strong, independent state, the unity of the French people and references to de Gaulle&#x27;s leadership. Neo-Gaullists have also conserved in some aspects the idea that France has a role to play in containing the world&#x27;s &quot;hyperpowers&quot;, as seen in Chirac&#x27;s refusal to follow the US in the Iraq War in 2003.

Pompidolian Gaullism (&quot;Gaullism pompidolien&quot;) highlights the need for France to adapt its economy in an increasingly competing world that may threaten social peace at home, in the legacy of French president Georges Pompidou (1969–1974). &quot;Second-generation Chiraquian Gaullism&quot; (or &quot;Chiraquian neo-Gaullism&quot;), which emerged in the mid-1980s, has been influenced by neoliberalism and is more open to European integration, in the legacy of French president Jacques Chirac (1995–2007).

== History ==
In France, the term Gaullist Party is usually used to refer to the largest party professing to be Gaullist. Gaullism claims to transcend the left–right divide in a similar way to populist republican parties elsewhere such as Fianna Fáil in Republic of Ireland, the Justicialist Party in Argentina, and the African National Congress in South Africa.

In the past, some Gaullist voters saw themselves as leaning towards the political left, a view ascribed to the once-leading Gaullist André Malraux. Most of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s own followers leaned towards the political right, christian democratic or national conservative. Consequently, left-leaning voters started showing less support again after Malraux&#x27;s death in 1976, as figures of the Gaullist left (like Jacques Chaban-Delmas) were gradually marginalised. Under its various names and acronyms, the Gaullist Party has been the dominant organisation of the French right since the beginning of the Fifth Republic (1958).

=== De Gaulle vs. the parties (1944–1947) ===
Author of the L&#x27;Appel of 18 June 1940, and founder and leader of the Free French Forces, General Charles de Gaulle is the symbol of the French Resistance to the Nazi occupation and the Vichy government. Yet, based in London, then in Algiers, he was forced to compromise with the domestic Resistance movements dominated by various political forces (such as the Communists). In 1944, while France was liberated, de Gaulle presided over the provisional government composed of Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats. Because de Gaulle refused to create a great political party unifying the non-Communist Resistance, a lot of parties re-emerged. The Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) seemed to be the closest to de Gaulle.

The provisional government implemented policies inspired by the programme of the National Council of Resistance: nationalization of banks and some industrial companies (for example Renault), and the development of a welfare state. However, it was divided about the way forward for political institutions and the constitution for the Fourth Republic. For de Gaulle, the &quot;regime of the parties&quot; that had characterized the Third Republic was a cause of the 1940 military disaster. He advocated a strong executive power, governing in the national interest, led by a man who was an incarnation of national unity. Indeed, in his mind, France is strong when it is united and the parties, represented in Parliament, serve particular interests and thus express national divisions.

In November 1945, a large majority of the French voters accepted the elaboration of a new Constitution. At the same time, they elected a new National Assembly. The French Communist Party, the Socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) and the Christian democratic MRP were the largest forces represented in this Assembly. It re-elected de Gaulle as president of the provisional government but, disagreeing with restoration of the &quot;regime of the parties&quot;, de Gaulle resigned in January 1946.

In May 1946, a first constitutional law was rejected by referendum. One month later, a new Assembly was elected in order to write a new constitutional text. In his &quot;Bayeux Manifesto&quot;, de Gaulle outlined his institutional ideas but he was accused of wanting re-establish a Bonapartist government. Furthermore, without the support of a political force, he could not influence the constitutional law being prepared. René Capitant founded a Gaullist Union for the Fourth Republic but it could not prevent the approval of the text prepared by the elected National Assembly, which restored the parliamentary system.

=== Gaullist party and Fourth Republic: opposition and desert crossing (1947–1958) ===
In 1947, he gathered the anti-Communist opposition in the Rally of the French People (&quot;Rassemblement du peuple français&quot; or RPF). He accused the Fourth Republic of being dominated by the &quot;parliamentary fiddles&quot; and to organize the state helplessness. In keeping with its strongly nationalist stance, it accused the French Communist Party of being a vassal of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it denounced what it called the &quot;abandonment&quot; of colonies by the Third Force cabinets, and it viewed French participation in the European Economic Community to be a threat to the nation. In addition, the Gaullists recommended an association between capital and labour in order to end the &quot;struggle of classes&quot;, which hampered national unity.

Six months after its founding, membership of the RPF reached one million. It took control of the executive of many cities, including Paris, Marseille and Bordeaux. After the 1951 legislative election, despite the change to the ballot system, the RPF formed the largest parliamentary group of the National Assembly but had a systematic opposition.

In 1952, some RPF deputies voted in favour of Antoine Pinay&#x27;s cabinet then joined the majority, against the instructions of de Gaulle. They left the RPF parliamentary group. More and more divided, the RPF suffered a significant decrease in support in the 1953 local elections. On 6 May 1953, de Gaulle asked to the Gaullist deputies to abandon the name &quot;RPF&quot;. One month later, 5 Gaullist deputies joined Joseph Laniel&#x27;s government. Indeed, they participated to right-wing majorities then, a part of the Gaullists as Jacques Chaban-Delmas joined the centre-left Republican Front under the label National Centre of Social Republicans (&quot;Centre national des républicains sociaux&quot; or CNRS).

At the end of the 1950s, the Fourth Republic floundered in the Algerian War. The 13 May 1958 crisis led to turmoil, and a threat of military coup was brandished. Emissaries sent by de Gaulle such as Jacques Soustelle participated in this bustle. The National Assembly accepted to call back de Gaulle to lead the cabinet. On 28 September, a new constitution was approved by referendum and the Fifth Republic was born. The parliamentary system was not questioned, but the presidential function was enhanced.

=== Gaullist party&#x27;s height (1958–1976) ===
In order that he should not be faced with an hostile National Assembly, dominated by the parties (as was the case in 1945–1946), de Gaulle let his followers organize a political party, the Union for the New Republic (&quot;Union pour la nouvelle république&quot; or UNR). After the November 1958 legislative election, it became the largest force in the political system. It was allied with centre-left and centre-right parties to support de Gaulle, who was elected President of France by a congress of local and national elected officials in December 1958. Michel Debré was nominated as prime minister.

However, the change of Algerian policy divided the party. The chairman of the National Assembly Jacques Chaban-Delmas considered Algeria was a part of the presidential &quot;reserved domain&quot;, as well as foreign and military affairs. Soustelle, leader of the pro-French Algeria faction in the party, left the cabinet in 1960, then was ejected from the UNR. He joined Georges Bidault at the head of the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; which perpetrated terrorist attacks. After this crisis, the UNR appeared as the party of de Gaulle&#x27;s unconditional supporters, hence its reputation of &quot;boot party&quot;. Debré theorized its function of strap of the government. With de Gaulle refusing to be a party leader, Debré covertly took this position.

Meanwhile, the centre-left parties returned to the opposition in 1959, followed in 1962 by the centre-right parties, who criticized the eurosceptic declarations of de Gaulle and the &quot;presidentialisation&quot; of French politics. Indeed, de Gaulle instituted the direct election of the presidency, defying all political parties (except the UNR). The French voters approved this by referendum. De Gaulle had intended to replace Debré with Georges Pompidou as prime minister but this was denied by a vote of no-confidence. De Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly. Associated with the left-wing Gaullists of the Democratic Union of Labour (&quot;Union démocratique du travail&quot; or UDT), and allied with Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s Independent Republicans, the UNR won the 1962 legislative election and Pompidou was confirmed to lead the cabinet.

Naturally, the UNR/UDT supported de Gaulle&#x27;s candidature at the 1965 presidential election. But he won only after a second ballot, which he considered as a disavowal. Relations became more difficult with the only non-Gaullist party in the presidential majority, the Independent Republicans, while the opposition was reconstructed.

While the Popular Republican Movement intensified its criticism, some Christian-Democrats, such Maurice Schumann, joined the Gaullist Party, renamed Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic (&quot;Union des démocrates pour la Cinquième République&quot; or UD-Ve). Prime Minister Pompidou led the party during the 1967 legislative campaign. He encouraged the emergence of a new generation of Gaullist politicians who were loyal to him. The incumbent parliamentary majority only won a narrow victory.

One year later, Gaullist power was confronted with the social and student protests of the May 1968 crisis. Although the newly renamed Union for the Defense of the Republic (&quot;Union pour la défense de la République&quot; or UDR) triumphed at the June 1968 legislative election, disagreements had risen between de Gaulle and Pompidou. Pompidou reproached de Gaulle for leaving the country during the crisis without informing him. For de Gaulle, his aim of an alliance between capital and labour could prevent this sort of social crisis, but Pompidou wished to scrap it. Indeed, for de Gaulle&#x27;s circle, Pompidou was more a classical conservative than a real Gaullist.

Pompidou left the leadership of the cabinet in order to prepare his future presidential campaign. In this, he declared his candidacy if de Gaulle were to resign. That was the case in 1969, after the failure of that year&#x27;s referendum on Senate and regional reform, and he won the 1969 presidential election despite the reluctance of some of the &quot;barons of Gaullism&quot;.

His prime minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas announced a reform programme for a &quot;New Society&quot;. It raised sceptical reactions from the conservative wing of the UDR, then from Pompidou himself. They reproached him for giving too many concessions to the left-wing opposition. In President Pompidou&#x27;s circle, he was accused of wanting to weaken the presidential functions in favour of himself. The party became the Union of Democrats for the Republic (&quot;Union des démocrates pour la République&quot;) while this crisis broke out. Pompidou refused Chaban-Delmas a vote of confidence in the National Assembly and, when he held it anyway, Pompidou forced him to resign and nominated Pierre Messmer. The UDR, allied with the Independent Republicans and Centre, Democracy and Progress, won the 1973 legislative election and succeeded in blocking the &quot;Union of the Left&quot; and its &quot;Common Programme&quot;.

When Pompidou died in office, on 2 April 1974, his two former prime ministers, Chaban-Delmas and Messmer, claimed the UDR candidacy for the presidential election. Finally, the latter withdrew, but some influential personalities in the party, notably in the circle of the late president, doubted of the capacity of Chaban-Delmas to defeat François Mitterrand, the representative of the &quot;Union of the Left&quot;. Led by the young minister Jacques Chirac, a former adviser of Pompidou, they published the &quot;Call of the 43&quot;. They covertly supported Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Minister of Economy and the Independent Republicans&#x27; leader. Giscard eliminated Chaban-Delmas in the first round, then narrowly defeated Mitterrand in the second. He was the first non-Gaullist President of the Fifth Republic.

Chirac became prime minister, and then leader of the UDR in December 1974, in spite of the negative opinions of many historical Gaullist personalities (Michel Debré, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, etc.). They accused him of having betrayed the party during the previous presidential campaign. Some months later, a conflict broke out between the executive leadership and Chirac left the cabinet in August 1976.

=== Chirac-led neo-Gaullist party: RPR and UMP (1976–2007) ===
In December 1976, the UDR was replaced by the Rally for the Republic (&quot;Rassemblement pour la République&quot; or RPR). This name was chosen due to its similarity with the RPF. Indeed, the New Gaullist Party was devised as a machine of reconquest behind one man, Jacques Chirac.

Without withdrawing from the presidential majority, the RPR criticized the executive duo of President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Prime Minister Raymond Barre. In December 1978, six months before the 1979 European Parliament election, the &quot;Call of Cochin&quot; denounced the &quot;abasement of France&quot; by &quot;the foreign party&quot;, which sacrificed the national interests and the independence of the country in order to build a federal Europe. This accusation targeted clearly Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. The RPR contrasted the social doctrine of Gaullism to the president&#x27;s market liberalism.

The RPR supported Chirac in the 1981 presidential election but he was eliminated in the first round. He refused to give instructions for voting for the second round, even if he said &quot;in a private capacity&quot;, he would vote for Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. In fact, the RPR was suspected of working for the defeat of the incumbent president.

While the Socialist Party leader François Mitterrand became president, the RPR gradually abandoned the Gaullist doctrine, adopting the European and liberal positions of the Union for French Democracy (&quot;Union pour la démocratie française&quot; or UDF). The two parties competed for the leadership of the right-wing opposition, but they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election and a platform to prepare for winning the 1986 legislative election.

From 1986 to 1988, Chirac &quot;cohabited&quot; as prime minister with Mitterrand, but lost the 1988 presidential election. After his defeat, his leadership was challenged by younger politicians who wished to renew the right. Furthermore, the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine was criticized by Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin. They tried to remove him from the RPR leadership in 1990, in vain. However, the division re-appeared with the 1992 Maastricht referendum. Chirac voted &quot;yes&quot; whereas Séguin and Pasqua campaigned for &quot;no&quot;.

The &quot;Union for France&quot;, a RPR/UDF coalition, won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac refused to re-cohabit with Mitterrand, and his confidente Edouard Balladur became prime minister. Balladur promised he would not be a candidate in the 1995 presidential election. Nevertheless, polls indicated Balladur was the favorite in the presidential race and furthermore, he was supported by the majority of right-wing politicians. He decided finally to be a candidate against Chirac. However, they claimed they remained &quot;friends for 30 years&quot;.

The Socialists being weakened after the 14 years of Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency, the main contest was on the right, between Balladur and Chirac, two Neo-Gaullists. Balladur proposed a neoliberal programme and took advantage of the &quot;positive results&quot; of his cabinet, whereas Chirac advocated Keynesianism to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot; and criticized the &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, targeting Balladur. Chirac won the 1995 presidential election.

In November 1995, his prime minister Alain Juppé, &quot;the best among us&quot; according to Chirac, announced a plan of welfare state reforms which sparked wide social conflict. President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly and lost the 1997 legislative election. He was forced to cohabit with a left-wing cabinet led by Lionel Jospin until 2002.

Séguin succeeded Juppé as RPR leader. But, he criticized the ascendancy of President Jacques Chirac over the party. He resigned during the 1999 European election campaign, while Pasqua presented a dissident list to advocate the Gaullist idea of a &quot;Europe of nations&quot;. Pasqua founded the Rally for France (&quot;Rassemblement pour la France&quot; or RPF) and obtained more votes than the RPR official list led by Nicolas Sarkozy. Michèle Alliot-Marie was elected RPR leader, against the wishes of President Chirac who supported another candidate.

Before the 2002 presidential election, RPR and non-RPR supporters of Chirac gathered in an association: the &quot;Union on the move&quot;. It became the Union for the Presidential Majority (&quot;Union pour la majorité présidentielle&quot; or UMP) after the 21 April electoral shock. Chirac was re-elected and the new party won the legislative election. It was renamed Union for a Popular Movement a few months later, establishing the UMP as a permanent organization. Jacques Chirac finished his presidency in 2007 after 12 years in power, where in 2004 the new president of the party became Nicolas Sarkozy the main rival of Chirac.

<doc id="323427" wikidata="Q5557151" url="?curid=323427" title="State of Decay (Doctor Who)">
<text>State of Decay is the fourth serial of the 18th season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 22 November to 13 December 1980.

&quot;State of Decay&quot; is the second of three loosely connected serials set in another universe known as E-Space. In the serial, three vampire lords rule over a village deliberately kept at a low development level for a thousand years. The lords intend to revive their giant leader vampire, the &quot;Great One&quot;, that converted them from humans after their spaceship crashed on the planet.

==Plot==
After the events of &quot;Full Circle&quot;, the Fourth Doctor, Romana, K9, and TARDIS stowaway Adric arrive on a planet with a feudal society whose inhabitants live under the thrall of three lords—Zargo, Camilla, and Aukon—who dwell in a shadowy Tower. The Doctor and Romana discover evidence of advanced technology and wonder what happened to cause the planet to devolve to its current &quot;state of decay&quot;. After being taken prisoner by the three lords, The Doctor and Romana discover that the great Tower in which the Lords dwell is a spaceship called &quot;Hydrax&quot;, originally from Earth. The three lords are members of the original crew, mutated into vampires, while the subjects beneath them are the descendants of the other colonists, made dull and primitive by generations of breeding and oppression. 

A rebel called Tarak infiltrates the Tower, freeing the Doctor and Romana. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS, while Romana stays with Tarak to search for Adric. They find Adric in a state of trance. Zargo and Camilla attack them, but Aukon compels them to stop. He wants Adric as a Chosen One and Romana, a Time Lord, for sacrifice at the Arising, the first taste of revenge for their master, the &quot;Great One.&quot;

In the TARDIS the Doctor discovers that the Great Vampires could only be defeated using specially designed ships which fired steel bolts that speared the monsters through the heart. Deep within the tower, he finds the last Great Vampire, about to be revived. The Doctor rigs one of the spaceship&#x27;s old scout ships to launch and fall back toward the ground, driving itself into the heart of the subterranean Great One. With the Great One dispatched, the three vampire Lords crumble to dust. 

The Doctor finds Romana and Adric and they leave the planet, hoping it will develop once again toward its former advanced state.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;The Wasting&quot; and &quot;The Witch Lords&quot;. The serial was a re-written version of a story originally entitled &quot;The Witch Lords&quot;, later retitled &quot;The Vampire Mutations&quot;, which Dicks had submitted to the series in 1977, but which had been pulled just before production because of fears of a possible conflict with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot;, a high-profile adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. It was replaced by &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; (1977).

This serial and the following &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot; featured an improved K9 prop.

==Broadcast and reception==
For &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Mark Braxton awarded &quot;State of Decay&quot; four stars out of five, writing that &quot;Terrance Dicks&#x27;s penultimate script for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; positively gushes with invention and wit. In fact, it&#x27;s among his cleverest, and gives an already striking season 18 a tremendous shot in the arm.&quot; He considered it &quot;a throwback to the Hinchcliffe/Holmes golden age, played with a totally straight bat and all the better for it.&quot; He regarded it as &quot;gorgeously designed&quot; and the &quot;vampiric triumvirate&quot; as &quot;wonderfully cast&quot;, and &quot;one of Tom Baker&#x27;s finest outings&quot;, saying there was an &quot;on-screen rapport&quot; between him and Lalla Ward which was &quot;charming and relaxed&quot;. He found some faults, stating that &quot;some effectively chilly location filming at Burnham Beeches notwithstanding, the bats are a bit lame, rendered by stock footage, cut-outs dangled from a string or a tinkling electronic noise. Despite their simmering menace, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo are all threat and no bite, swishing about with some bizarrely stagey movements. And the Great One is a gloved hand.&quot; However, he concluded by stating that it was &quot;supremely atmospheric, solid of script and with potent production values.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019, Toby Hadoke described it as &quot;a clever meld of vampire legend and science fiction&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell was less impressed, awarding it six out of ten, describing it as a &quot;limply directed vampire tale that doesn&#x27;t really gel – the horror should be more explicit, the vampirism more obvious. One feels the production team deliberately didn&#x27;t want to plagiarise Hammer, which, considering the Hammeresque script, seems a mistake.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

<doc id="323430" wikidata="Q1052584" url="?curid=323430" title="Rally for the Republic">
<text>The Rally for the Republic ( ; RPR ) was a Gaullist and conservative political party in France. Originating from the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR), it was founded by Jacques Chirac in 1976 and presented itself as the heir of Gaullist politics. It was one of the two major parties in French politics, alongside the Socialist Party. On 21 September 2002, the RPR was merged into the Union for the Presidential Majority, later renamed the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).

==History==

===The defense of the Gaullist identity against President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1976–1981)===

In 1974, the divisions in the Gaullist movement permitted the election of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing to the Presidency of the French Republic. Representing the pro-European and pseudo-Orleanist centre-right, he was the first non-Gaullist to become head of state since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958. However, the Gaullist Party remained the main force in parliament and Jacques Chirac was appointed prime minister. Chirac resigned in August 1976 and in December 1976 the RPR was created in order to restore the Gaullist domination over the institutions of the French republic.

Though retaining its support for the president&#x27;s government, the RPR criticized the executive duo composed of President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Its first master stroke was in March 1977 the election of Chirac as Mayor of Paris against Michel d&#x27;Ornano, a close friend of President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Nevertheless, it was faced with the creation of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), a confederation of the parties supporting the presidential policies and which competed for the leadership over the right. Consequently, the stake of the 1978 legislative election was not only the victory of the right over the left, but the domination of the RPR over the UDF in the parliamentary majority.

Given the increasing unpopularity of the executive duo, and with a view to the next presidential election, the RPR became increasingly critical. In December 1978, six months before the European Parliament election, the &quot;Call of Cochin&quot; signed by Chirac denounced the appropriation of France by &quot;the foreign party,&quot; which sacrificed the national interests and the independence of the country in order to build a federal Europe. This accusation clearly targeted Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. RPR leaders contrasted this as coming from the social doctrine of Gaullism as opposed to a perceived liberalism on the part of the President.

As RPR candidate at the 1981 presidential election, Chirac formulated vigorous condemnations of President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who ran for a second term. Eliminated in the first round, Chirac refused to give an endorsement for the second round, though he did say privately that he would vote for Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. In fact, the RPR was expected to work for the defeat of the incumbent president.

===The opposition to President Mitterrand and the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine (1981–1995)===

After 1981, the RPR opposed with energy the policy of the Socialist Party President François Mitterrand and the left-wing governments. The RPR denounced the plan of nationalizations as the setting up of a &quot;collectivist society&quot;. Impressed by the electoral success of New Right conservatives led by Ronald Reagan in the United States of America and by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom, it gradually abandoned the Gaullist doctrine, claiming less control of the state in the economy. During its 1983 congress, it advocated a liberal economic programme and the pursuit of the European construction, accepting the supranationality.

This new political line contributed to the reconciliation between the RPR and the UDF. In this, they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election and a platform to prepare the winning 1986 legislative election. However, a rivalry appeared between Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre who competed for the right-wing leadership with a view to the next presidential election. Furthermore, if the right-wing coalition benefited from the failures of the Socialist power, it was confronted with the emergence of the National Front in the far right. The RPR was divided about the possibility of alliance with this party.

In 1986, being the leader of the main party of the new parliamentary majority and accepting the principle of the &quot;cohabitation&quot; with President Mitterrand (contrary to Barre), Chirac became again prime minister. He led a liberal economic policy inspired by Anglo-Saxon examples, selling many public companies, and abolishing the wealth tax. His Interior Minister Charles Pasqua led a policy of restriction of immigration. If Chirac acceded in the second round of the 1988 presidential election despite Raymond Barre&#x27;s candidacy, he was defeated by Mitterrand.

While the RPR returned in the opposition, the leadership of Chirac was challenged by younger politicians who wished to renew the right. Furthermore, the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine was criticized by Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin. They tried to take him the RPR lead in 1990, in vain. However, the division re-appeared with the 1992 Maastricht referendum. Chirac voted &quot;yes&quot; whereas Séguin and Pasqua campaigned for &quot;no&quot;.

The &quot;Union for France&quot;, a RPR/UDF coalition, won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac refused to re-cohabitate with Mitterrand, and Edouard Balladur became prime minister. Balladur promised that he would not be a candidate at the 1995 presidential election. Nevertheless, polls indicated Balladur was the favorite in the presidential race and, furthermore, he was supported by most of the right-wing politicians. He decided finally to run against Chirac. However, they claimed that they remained friends for 30 years.

The Socialists being weakened after the 14 years of Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency, the main competition was within the right, between Balladur and Chirac, two Neo-Gaullists. Balladur proposed a liberal program and took advantage of the &quot;positive results&quot; of his cabinet, whereas Chirac advocated Keynesian economics to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot; and criticized the &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, targeting Balladur. Chirac won the 1995 presidential election.

===The RPR became the presidential party (1995–2002)===

After his election as President of France, Jacques Chirac nominated Alain Juppé, &quot;the best among us&quot; according to him, as prime minister. But the majority of the personalities who had supported Balladur during the presidential campaign were excluded from the government. The &quot;balladuriens&quot; (such as Nicolas Sarkozy) were completely isolated in the party too.

In November 1995, Prime Minister Alain Juppé announced a plan to reform the French welfare state which sparked wide social conflict. The executive duo became very unpopular and some months later President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly. His supporters lost the 1997 legislative election. Consequently, he was forced to cohabitate with a left-wing cabinet led by Lionel Jospin until 2002.

Séguin succeeded to Juppé as RPR leader, but he criticized the ascendancy of President Chirac over the party. He resigned during the 1999 European campaign while Pasqua presented a dissident list to advocate the Gaullist idea of a &quot;Europe of nations&quot;. Pasqua founded the Rally for France (RPF) and obtained more votes than the RPR official list led by Nicolas Sarkozy. Michèle Alliot-Marie, former Minister of Youth and sports, was elected RPR leader, against the will of President Chirac who supported covertly an unfamous candidate Jean-Paul Delevoye. Besides, the RPR was involved in many financing scandals. For instance, the party was suspected to pay its employees with the funds of Paris&#x27;s municipality. The RPR lost the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, in aid of the left.

After the 1999 European elections, the RPR joined the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats (EPP-ED) parliamentary group, and became a full member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) in December 2001.

Before the 2002 presidential election, both RPR and non-RPR supporters of Chirac gathered in an association: the &quot;Union on the move&quot;. It became the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) after the 21 April 2002 electoral shock. Chirac was re-elected and the new party won the legislative election.

Prior to its replacement by the UMP, the RPR had been increasingly embroiled in judicial proceedings following from the corruption scandals in the Paris region. Its former secretary-general Alain Juppé was sentenced in 2004 for a related felony. In 2007, a formal judicial investigation was opened against Jacques Chirac himself.

<text>Karl Oskar Medin (14 August 1847 – 24 December 1927) was a Swedish pediatrician. He was born at Axberg, Örebro and died in Stockholm. He is most famous for his study of poliomyelitis, a condition sometimes known as the Heine-Medin disease, named after Medin and another physician, Jakob Heine. Medin was the first to describe the epidemic character of infantile paralysis.

Medin studied in Uppsala and Stockholm, and received his medical doctorate in 1880 from the Uppsala University. He was appointed extraordinary professor at the Karolinska Institute in 1883 and went on to become professor of paediatrics the following year. He became professor emeritus in 1914.

In addition to his research of poliomyelitis, he had influenced the study of meningitis epidemica, infant scurvy and tuberculosis in children.

In recognition of his polio research accomplishments he was elected posthumously to the Polio Hall of Fame in Warm Springs, Georgia, which was dedicated in January 1958.

<doc id="323434" wikidata="Q173152" url="?curid=323434" title="Union for a Popular Movement">
<text>The Union for a Popular Movement ( ; UMP ) was a liberal-conservative political party in France, largely inspired by the Gaullist tradition. During its existence, the UMP was one of the two major parties in French politics along with the Socialist Party (PS). In May 2015, the party was succeeded by The Republicans.

Nicolas Sarkozy, the then president of the UMP, was elected president of France in the 2007 French presidential election, until he was later defeated by PS candidate François Hollande in the 2012 presidential election. After the November 2012 party congress, the UMP experienced internal fractioning and was plagued by monetary scandals which forced its president Jean-François Copé to resign. After Sarkozy&#x27;s re-election as UMP president in November 2014, he put forward an amendment to change the name of the party to The Republicans, which was approved and came into effect on 30 May 2015. The UMP enjoyed an absolute majority in the National Assembly from 2002 to 2012, and was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), the Centrist Democrat International (CDI) and the International Democrat Union (IDU).

==History==
===Background===
Since the 1980s, the political groups of the parliamentary right have joined forces around the values of economic liberalism and the building of Europe. Their rivalries had contributed to their defeat in the 1981 and 1988 legislative elections.

Before the 1993 legislative election, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed an electoral alliance, the Union for France (UPF). However, in the 1995 presidential campaign, they were both divided between followers of Jacques Chirac, who was eventually elected, and supporters of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. After their defeat in the 1997 legislative election, the RPR and UDF created the Alliance for France in order to coordinate the actions of their parliamentary groups.

===Foundation and early years===
Before the 2002 presidential campaign, the supporters of President Jacques Chirac, divided in three centre-right parliamentary parties, founded an association named Union on the Move (&quot;Union en mouvement&quot;). After Chirac&#x27;s re-election, in order to contest the legislative election jointly, the Union for the Presidential Majority (&quot;Union pour la majorité présidentielle&quot;) was created. It was renamed &quot;Union for a Popular Movement&quot; and as such established as a permanent organisation.

Various parties, such as the Gaullist-conservative Rally for the Republic (RPR), the conservative-liberal party Liberal Democracy (DL), a sizeable portion of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), merged their parties into the new party over the course of the first year. The UDF&#x27;s Christian Democrats (such as Philippe Douste-Blazy and Jacques Barrot), the Radical Party and the centrist Popular Party for French Democracy (both associate parties of the UDF until 2002), aligned themselves with the party for the 2002 French legislative election. In the UMP four major French political families were thus represented: Gaullism, republicanism (the kind of liberalism put forward by parties like the Democratic Republican Alliance or the PR, heir of DL), Christian democracy (&quot;Popularism&quot;) and radicalism.

Chirac&#x27;s close ally Alain Juppé became the party&#x27;s first president at the party&#x27;s founding congress at the Bourget in November 2002. Juppé won 79.42% of the vote, defeating Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the leader of the party&#x27;s Eurosceptic Arise the Republic faction, and three other candidates. During the party&#x27;s earlier years, it was marked by tensions and rivalries between Juppé and other &quot;chiraquiens&quot; and supporters of Nicolas Sarkozy, the then-Minister of the Interior.

In the 2004 regional elections, the UMP suffered a heavy blow, winning the presidencies of only 2 out of 22 regions in metropolitan France (Alsace and Corsica) and only half of the departments (the right had previously won numerous departmental presidencies) in the simultaneous 2004 cantonal elections. In the 2004 European Parliament election on 13 June 2004, the UMP also suffered another heavy blow, winning 16.6% of the vote, far behind the Socialist Party (PS), and only 16 seats.

The membership in the early 2000s grew from 100,000 to 300,000 after members received a greater say in the selection of the party’s presidential candidate.

===Nicolas Sarkozy (2004–2012)===
Juppé resigned the party&#x27;s presidency on 15 July 2004 after being found guilty in a corruption scandal in January of the same year. Nicolas Sarkozy rapidly announced that he would take over the presidency of the UMP and resign his position as finance minister, ending months of speculation. On 28 November 2004, Sarkozy was elected to the party&#x27;s presidency with 85.09% of the votes against 9.1% for Dupont-Aignan and 5.82% for Christine Boutin, the leader of the UMP&#x27;s social conservatives. Having gained control of what had been Chirac&#x27;s party, Sarkozy focused the party machinery and his energies on the 2007 presidential election.

The failure of the referendum on the European Constitution on 25 May 2005 led to the fall of the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin and to the formation of a new cabinet, presided by another UMP politician, Dominique de Villepin. However, during this time, the UMP under Sarkozy gained a record number of new members and rejuvenated itself in preparation of the 2007 election. On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was nominated unopposed as the UMP&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2007 election.

On the issues, the party under Sarkozy publicly disapproved of Turkey&#x27;s proposed membership in the European Union, which Chirac had previously endorsed several times publicly, and generally took a more right-wing position.

On 22 April 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy won the plurality of votes in the first round of the 2007 presidential election. On 6 May he faced the Socialist Party candidate Ségolène Royal in the second round and won, taking 53.06% of the vote. As a consequence, he resigned from the presidency of the UMP on 14 May 2007, two days before becoming President of the French Republic. François Fillon was appointed prime minister. On 17 June 2007, at a 2007 legislative election, the UMP gained a majority in the National Assembly with 313 out of 577 seats.

Following Sarkozy&#x27;s election to the presidency, interim leader Jean-Claude Gaudin prevented a leadership struggle between Patrick Devedjian and Jean-Pierre Raffarin by announcing that the UMP should have a collegial leadership while Sarkozy was President of the Republic. In July, the UMP&#x27;s national council approved an amendment to the party&#x27;s statute allowing for a collegial leadership around three vice-presidents (Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Jean-Claude Gaudin and Pierre Méhaignerie) and a secretary-general (Patrick Devedjian) and two associate secretaries-general.

On 9 March 2008, municipal and cantonal elections, the party performed quite poorly, losing numerous cities, such as Toulouse and Strasbourg, as well as eight departmental presidencies to the left. Xavier Bertrand was selected as secretary-general of the party in late 2008 to replace Patrick Devedjian, who resigned to take up a cabinet position.

In the 2009 European Parliament election on 7 June 2009, the UMP ran common lists with its junior allies including Jean-Louis Borloo&#x27;s Radical Party, the New Centre and Modern Left. The UMP list won 27.9%, a remarkably good result for a governing party in off-year &quot;mid-term&quot; elections, and elected 29 MEPs, significantly improving on the UMP&#x27;s poor result in the 2004 European election – also an off-year election. However, in the 2010 regional elections on 14 and 21 March 2010, the UMP obtained a very poor result with only 26%. While it lost Corsica, it retained Alsace but also defeated the left in &quot;La Réunion&quot; and French Guiana.

In a cabinet reshuffle in November 2010, which disappointed centrists within and outside the UMP, François Fillon was confirmed prime minister and Alain Juppé re-joined the government. Among those who resigned from the cabinet were Bernard Kouchner, Hervé Morin and, above all, Jean-Louis Borloo. Xavier Bertrand, who re-joined the government, was replaced as general-secretary of the UMP by Jean-François Copé on 17 November 2010.

The party suffered another major electoral defeat in the 2011 cantonal elections held on 20 and 27 March 2011, and in September, the centre-right lost control of the French Senate for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic.

In May 2011, during a party congress, the Radical Party, led by Borloo, decided to leave the UMP and launch The Alliance, a new centrist coalition.

The party opted not to organise primaries ahead of the 2012 presidential election and endorsed Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s bid for second term. Sarkozy lost reelection to the Socialist Party candidate François Hollande on 6 May 2012, winning 48.36% in the runoff. The party was defeated by the new president&#x27;s left-wing majority in the subsequent legislative election.

===After May 2012===
Prior to Sarkozy&#x27;s defeat on 6 May, the UMP&#x27;s secretary-general Jean-François Copé announced that he supported the creation of internal &quot;movements&quot; within the party and the organisation of primaries for the next presidential election.

====Campaign for the November 2012 congress====
The UMP&#x27;s political bureau announced the organisation of a party congress on 18 and 25 November 2012, leading prominent party leaders to organise factions and &quot;movements&quot; to influence the party&#x27;s new direction.

Ultimately, two candidates amassed the required endorsements to run for the party&#x27;s presidency: former prime minister François Fillon and incumbent party secretary-general Jean-François Copé. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Bruno Le Maire, Xavier Bertrand, Henri Guaino, and Dominique Dord had also announced their candidacies but did not meet tough candidacy requirements.

The campaign between Fillon and Copé lasted two months. Fillon had a strong lead in polls of UMP &#x27;sympathizers&#x27; (as opposed to actual members, who would be the only eligible voters) and was backed by most UMP parliamentarians while Copé claimed he was the candidate of party activists rather than party &#x27;barons&#x27;. However, Copé remained as secretary-general and retained control of the party machinery.

While Fillon&#x27;s campaign was regarded as more consensual, moderate and centre-right; Copé campaigned as the candidate of the &quot;droite décomplexée&quot; (&#x27;uninhibited right&#x27;) and introduced issues such as anti-white racism. However, both candidates received support from moderate and conservative members of the party and their main differences were in rhetoric, style and temperament. Copé, again, appeared more militant and activist, saying that he would support and participate in street demonstrations while Fillon disagreed with his rival.

Six &#x27;motions&#x27; (declarations of principles) were submitted to party voters; under the new statutes, motions which won over 10% of the vote at the congress would be recognised as &quot;movements&quot; by the UMP leadership, granted financial autonomy and receive positions in the party structures.

====Results and subsequent crisis====
The vote on 18 November saw high turnout but was quickly marred by allegations of irregularities and potential fraud on both sides. Both candidates proclaimed victory within 20 minutes of each other on the night of the vote.

Twenty four hours later, the control commission in charge of the vote (COCOE) announced Copé&#x27;s victory by only 98 votes. While Fillon initially conceded defeat, by 21 November, his campaign claimed victory anew, with a 26-vote advantage over Copé. Fillon&#x27;s campaign argued that the COCOE had failed to take into account votes cast in three overseas federations.

Party elder Alain Juppé accepted to lead a mediation between both candidates on 23 November, but it failed within two days. Fillon&#x27;s announced &quot;precautionary seizure&quot; of ballots cast &quot;to protect them from tampering or alteration&quot; and threatened to take the matter to court. On 26 November, the party appeals commission – led by a close supporter of Copé – decided in Copé&#x27;s favour and rejected Fillon&#x27;s arguments.

On 27 November, 72 &quot;filloniste&quot; parliamentarians in the National Assembly announced the creation of a new parliamentary group, the &quot;Rassemblement-UMP&quot;, led by Fillon. Copé took up former president Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s proposal of organising a referendum on a revote, but he saw the creation of the dissident &quot;filloniste&quot; group as a casus belli and took back his proposal. Luc Chatel, the new vice-president and a Copé supporter, later announced that he supported a new presidential vote and a modification of party statutes. The next day, Copé announced that he favoured organising a referendum the modification of party statutes and a reduction of his own term as president to two years (until November 2014); while Fillon welcomed the &quot;consensus on the organisation of a new election&quot; he rejected his rival&#x27;s timeline and called for a new election before 2014. &#x27;Unaligned&#x27; members of the UMP led by Bruno Le Maire and Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet appealed for the organisation of a new election in the spring of 2013 and a reform of the party statutes.

====Resolution====
Both rivals reached an agreement at the end of December 2012, with Copé agreeing to the organisation of a new election and a modification of party statutes while Fillon agreed to dissolve his parliamentary group.

The party&#x27;s leadership was reorganized in January 2013 to accommodate Copé and Fillon&#x27;s supporters: Laurent Wauquiez and Valérie Pécresse joined Luc Chatel and Michèle Tabarot as vice-president and secretary-general respectively. Christian Estrosi, Gérard Longuet, Henri de Raincourt (pro-Fillon), Jean-Claude Gaudin, Brice Hortefeux and Roger Karoutchi (pro-Copé) also became vice-presidents. Other positions in the party hierarchy were divided between supporters of both candidates. New leaders were also nominated in February 2013.

==== Bygmalion scandal====
Several spending scandals appeared in 2014. In early 2014, the Bygmalion scandal (fr) pushed the party&#x27;s leader Jean-François Copé to resign. In early July, Sarkozy got held in custody due to possible spying and active corruption of the judiciary system. On 8 July 2014, the UMP was discovered to have a hidden debt of €79.1 million for the year 2013. On 20 May 2021, the criminal trial began for Sarkozy and 13 other defendants who were said to have been involved in the Bygmalion scandal. The scandal allegations that Sarkozy diverting tens of millions of euros which was intended to be spent on his failed 2012 re-election campaign and then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. The illicit campaign finance money which was not reported as being spent on Sarkozy&#x27;s re-election campaign was instead used to overspend on lavish campaign rallies and events. On 30 September 2021, Sarkozy and his co-defendants would be convicted for violating France&#x27;s campaign finance spending limit law. For this conviction, Sarkozy was given a 1-year prison sentence, though he was also given the option to instead serve this sentence at home with an electronic bracelet.

===Name change and dissolution===
After the election of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former President of France (2007–2012), as president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in November 2014, he put forward a request to the party&#x27;s general committee to change its name to the Republicans as well as the statutes of the party. With the name already chosen Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, vice president of the UMP, presented Nicolas Sarkozy and the party&#x27;s political bureau a project of new statutes. The proposed statutes provided for, among others, the election of the presidents of the departmental federations by direct suffrage, the end of the political currents and consulting members on election nominations.

Critics of Sarkozy claimed it was illegal for him to name the party &quot;Republicans&quot; because every French person is a republican in that they support the values and ideals of the French Republic that emanated from the French Revolution, and as such the term is above party politics. The new name was adopted by the bureau on 5 May 2015 and approved by the party membership on 28 May by an online yes vote of 83.28% on a 45.74% participation after a court ruling in favor of Sarkozy. Similarly the new party statutes are adopted by 96.34% of voters and the composition of the new party&#x27;s political bureau by 94.77%.
The Republicans thus became the legal successor of the UMP as the leading centre-right party in France.

==Ideology and platform==

The UMP was a party of the centre-right belonging to the Gaullist lineage, and was variously described as liberal-conservative, conservative, conservative-liberal, and Christian democratic.

The UMP believed that each individual&#x27;s destiny must be unencumbered and it rejects political systems which &quot;stifle economic freedom&quot;. It said that work, merit, innovation and personal initiative must be encouraged to reduce unemployment and boost economic growth; but at the same time, it maintained that adherence to the rule of law and the authority of the state is necessary. In a Gaullist tradition, the UMP supported solidarity, with the state guaranteeing social protection of less fortunate individuals. But in a more liberal vein, the party always denounced &quot;l&#x27;assistanat&quot;, a French term which can refer to &quot;welfare handouts&quot;.

The party took more nationalist positions at times, and often adopted tough stances against immigration and illegal immigration. It strongly supported the integration and assimilation of immigrants into French society and always denounced communitarianism as a danger to the French nation-state. However, the UMP traditionally was a strong proponent of European integration and the European Union, albeit sometimes with a hint of traditional Gaullist souverainism.

Under Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s leadership, the UMP adopted a liberal and security-oriented platform. His platform in the 2007 and 2012 presidential elections emphasised the ideas of personal responsibility and individual initiative. He developed the idea of &quot;working more to earn more&quot;, promising that overtime hours would not be taxed and employers exonerated from non-wage labour costs. Under his presidency, the government&#x27;s short-lived tax cap for high-income earners was denounced by the left but also several centrist and centre-right politicians within or outside the UMP.

Having gained his popularity as a &#x27;hardliner&#x27; Interior minister, Sarkozy&#x27;s policies also carried a strong law-and-order and tough on crime orientation. He supported tougher sentences for criminals and repeat offenders. As candidate and president, he placed heavy emphasis on immigration and national identity, presenting immigration as a danger to French identity and as source of increased criminality. As president, he imposed stricter limits on family reunification, created a Ministry of Immigration, and National Identity for three years between 2007 and 2010, launched a controversial national dialogue on national identity and expelled thousands of Roma from illegal camps.

Critics of the right-wing government denounced what they felt was a rapprochement with the controversial far-right National Front (FN). While several members of the UMP&#x27;s right-wing have indicated that they would favour local alliances with the FN and prefer to vote for a FN candidate over a Socialist Party or left-wing candidate in runoff elections between the left and the FN; the party&#x27;s official position continues to reject alliances with the FN at any level but also opposes so-called &quot;republican fronts&quot; with the left against the FN.

==Factions==
The UMP&#x27;s original statutes in 2002 allowed for the organisation of formal factions or movements within the party, to represent the various political families of which it was made up. However, fearing leadership rivalries and divisions, Juppé, Chirac and later Sarkozy &#x27;postponed&#x27; the creation of such organised movements indefinitely. Nevertheless, prior to the organisations of formal &quot;movements&quot; in November 2012, there existed informal groupings of like-minded members, either through associations, political clubs, associated political parties or even informal factions.

Jean-François Copé allowed for the organisation of formal movements within the party following the November 2012 congress. According to the party&#x27;s statutes, motions backed by at least 10 parliamentarians from 10 departmental federations and which obtain at least 10% support from members at a congress are recognised as movements. They are granted financial autonomy by way of a fixed grant and additional funding in proportion to the votes they obtained; but the sum of funds transferred by the party to its movements can be no larger than 30% of the annual public subsidies the UMP receives from the state.

===Official movement and factions===
Six motions representing various ideological tendencies within the party ran to be recognised as official movements following the November 2012 congress. Five of these motions met the conditions to be recognised as such, and their leaders have since integrated the UMP&#x27;s leadership structure:

* The Strong Right (&quot;La Droite forte&quot;): 27.77%
** Sarkozysts (conservatives, liberal-conservatives, conservative-liberals, social conservatives): Nicolas Sarkozy, Jean-Claude Gaudin, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Édouard Balladur, Dominique Bussereau, Michel Barnier, Dominique Perben, Jean-François Mattei, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, Charles Millon, Alain Lamassoure, Brice Hortefeux, Joseph Daul, Rachida Dati, Bernard Accoyer, Marie-Hélène Descamps

* Gaullism, a way forward for France (&quot;Le Gaullisme, une voie d&#x27;avenir pour la France&quot;): 12.31%
** Neo-Gaullists, formerly known also as Chiraquiens (right-wing slightly liberal Gaullists, secular-minded conservatives): Jacques Chirac, Michèle Alliot-Marie, Dominique de Villepin, Jean-Louis Debré, Jean-François Copé, Alain Juppé, Patrick Ollier, François Baroin, Xavier Bertrand, Xavier Darcos, Valérie Pécresse, Christine Albanel, Éric Wœrth, Roger Karoutchi, Josselin de Rohan, Adrien Gouteyron, Hervé Mariton
** The Free Right (conservative-liberals, souverainists): Rachid Kaci, Alexandre del Valle, Étienne Blanc, François d&#x27;Aubert
* The Popular Right (&quot;La Droite populaire&quot;): 10.87%
** Initiative and Liberty Movement (Gaullists, national-conservatives): Bernard Debré, Eric Raoult, Jean Tiberi
** Rally for France (national-conservatives, souverainists): Charles Pasqua, Lionnel Luca, Jacques Myard, Jean-Jacques Guillet, Philippe Pemezec

===Associate parties===
The Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition, the Christian Democratic Party, the Rally for France and The Progressives are associate parties of the UMP. By adhering to these parties, members also adhered to the UMP and could participate in the UMP&#x27;s inner organisation. The Radical Party was associated with the UMP from 2002 through 2011.

Overseas parties associated with the UMP included O Porinetia To Tatou Ai&#x27;a in French Polynesia and The Rally–UMP in New Caledonia.

===2012 leadership election===
The aforementioned November 2012 congress saw the division of the party between the two candidates who sought the party&#x27;s presidency, François Fillon and Jean-François Copé – the &quot;fillonistes&quot; and &quot;copéistes&quot;.
* &quot;Copéistes&quot; (supporters of Jean-François Copé): Jean-François Copé, Luc Chatel, Michèle Tabarot, Jean-Claude Gaudin, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Marc-Philippe Daubresse, Hervé Novelli, Christian Jacob, Lionnel Luca, Thierry Mariani, Guillaume Peltier, Rachida Dati, Brice Hortefeux, Nadine Morano, Jean Sarkozy, Valérie Rosso-Debord etc.
* &quot;Fillonistes&quot; (supporters of François Fillon): François Fillon, Laurent Wauquiez, Valérie Pécresse, Xavier Bertrand, Christian Estrosi, Éric Ciotti, Gérard Larcher, François Baroin, Patrick Devedjian, Dominique Bussereau, Valérie Boyer, Dominique Dord, Patrick Ollier, Éric Woerth, Hubert Falco, Gérard Longuet etc.
* Unaligned members: Bruno Le Maire, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet. Nicolas Sarkozy and Alain Juppé also remained neutral and did not officially endorse any candidate.

==Elected officials==
* Deputies: 186 members and nine caucusing members in the UMP group in the National Assembly. This group also includes some members of the Radical Party, the Christian Democratic Party and Miscellaneous Right deputies.
* Senators: 131 members in the UMP group in the Senate. This group also includes members of the Radical Party and The Rally-UMP
* MEPs: 24 members in the EPP Group in the European Parliament.

===Major officeholders===
* Nicolas Sarkozy (President of the Republic, 2007–2012)
* François Fillon (Prime Minister, 2007–2012)
* Bernard Accoyer (President of the National Assembly)
* Jean-Louis Debré (President of the Constitutional Council)
* Joseph Daul (President of the EPP Group in the European Parliament)

==Popular support==
The UMP&#x27;s electoral base reflects that of the old Rally for the Republic (RPR) and, in some cases, that of the Union for French Democracy (UDF). In the 2007 presidential election, Nicolas Sarkozy performed best in the east of France – particularly Alsace (36.2%); Provence-Alpes-Côte-d&#x27;Azur (37.0%) – the wealthy coastal department of the Alpes-Maritimes (43.6%) was his best department in France; Champagne-Ardenne (32.7%) and Rhône-Alpes (32.7%). These areas were among National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s best regions in 2002 and are conservative on issues such as immigration. Sarkozy received a lot of votes from voters who had supported the far-right in April 2002. For example, in the Alpes-Maritimes, Sarkozy performed 21.6% better than Chirac did in 2002 while Le Pen lost 12.6% in five years. Sarkozy also appealed more than average to blue-collar workers in regions such as northern Meurthe-et-Moselle and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, although most of these regions, despite his gains, remain reliably left-wing. The party is also strong in every election in very wealthy suburban or coastal (and, in some cases, urban) areas such as Neuilly-sur-Seine (72.6% for Sarkozy in the first round), Saint-Tropez (54.79%), Cannes (48.19%) or Marcq-en-Barœul (47.35%). It is strong in most rural areas, like most conservative parties in the world, but this does not extend to the rural areas of the south of France, areas which are old strongholds of republican and secular ideals. However, in old &quot;clerical&quot; Catholic rural areas, such as parts of Lozère or Cantal, it is very strong, as was the UDF during its hey day.

However, the UMP does poorly in one of the UDF&#x27;s best regions, Brittany, where the decline of religious practice, a moderate electorate and urbanisation has hurt the UMP and also the UDF. Nicolas Sarkozy performed relatively poorly in departments with a large share of moderate Christian democratic (often centrist or centre-right) voters, such as Lozère where the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal performed better (44.3%) than François Mitterrand had in his 1988 left-wing landslide (43.1%). While former president Jacques Chirac, the right&#x27;s strongman in normally left-wing Corrèze had always done very well in Corrèze and the surrounding departments, Sarkozy did very poorly and actually lost the department in the 2007 runoff. However, in the 2009 European election, the UMP&#x27;s results in those departments were superior to Sarkozy&#x27;s first round result (nationally, they were 4% lower).

<text>ASV Records was a London-based record label set up by Harley Usill, founder of Argo Records, Decca producer and former Argo general manager, Kevin Daly, and producer Jack Boyce, after Argo&#x27;s parent company Decca was bought by PolyGram in 1980. ASV stood for &quot;Academy Sound and Vision&quot;. The label was bought by the Sanctuary Records Group in May 1999.

ASV, which was founded in London in 1981, was mainly a classical label, but its catalogue included Bing Crosby, Cole Porter, The Ink Spots, and The Boswell Sisters. Starting in 1986, ASV had an imprint called Living Era, created by Kevin Daly, which specialized in reissuing recordings (particularly American jazz recordings) that are in the public domain in the UK, which are all at least 50 years old. It also showcased American pop music, American country music, British dance bands, and British nostalgia.

Much of ASV&#x27;s classical catalogue was reissued on Sanctuary&#x27;s Resonance budget label. Sanctuary&#x27;s UK recorded music business was shut down shortly after Universal Music Group bought the firm in 2007. This also included the ASV and ASV/Living Era imprints.

As a fulfilment of conditions imposed by the European Commission following UMG&#x27;s acquisition of most of EMI in 2012, Universal sold Sanctuary to BMG Rights Management in 2013. Thus, Warner Music Group, through its Alternative Distribution Alliance division, handles the catalogue of reissues from ASV&#x27;s artists&#x27; releases on Sanctuary&#x27;s behalf after BMG designated ADA in March 2017 as its distributor.

<doc id="323440" wikidata="Q686372" url="?curid=323440" title="Liberal Democracy (France)">
<text>Liberal Democracy (, , DL) was a conservative-liberal political party in France which existed from 1997 to 2002. Led by Alain Madelin, it replaced the Republican Party (PR), the classical liberal component of the Union for French Democracy (UDF). It merged into the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) between the two rounds of the 2002 presidential election.

==History==
After Madelin won the leadership of the Republican Party on 24 June 1997 with 59.9% of the vote, he renamed the organisation &#x27;Liberal Democracy&#x27;, and moved the party further towards economic liberalism. This followed the formation of the Democratic Force (FD) by the centrist, Christian democratic component of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), leading to internal rivalry.

Liberal Democracy became independent in 1998, after a split from the UDF. The immediate cause of this departure was Liberal Democracy&#x27;s refusal to condemn the election of four UDF president of Regional Councils with the votes of the National Front. However, the party had already feared that a tighter UDF would be dominated by economic centrists, preventing his free-market policies being heard.

Thus, Liberal Democracy voted on 16 May 1998 to become a separate party, with Madelin launching the &#x27;Ten Tough Choices&#x27; programme advocating transforming the political debate in France. The economic liberals that refused to break ranks with the UDF launched the Independent Republican and Liberal Pole, which later merged with FD and the so-called &#x27;Direct Adherents&#x27; to form the New UDF.

In the 1999 EU elections DL ran with the RPR list led by Nicolas Sarkozy. However, the pro-European tone of the RPR-DL campaign deceived and the list was placed in third, behind the eurosceptic RPF list led by Charles Pasqua and Philippe de Villiers. DL obtained four MEPs: Alain Madelin, Françoise Grossetête, Thierry Jean-Pierre and Hervé Novelli.

In the 2002 presidential election, the party split; while Alain Madelin obtained only 3.91% of the votes, party&#x27;s Vice-President Jean-Pierre Raffarin endorsed incumbent Jacques Chirac. After Chirac won, he appointed Raffarin as Prime Minister on 6 May 2002. At the June 2002 legislative election, DL competed in alliance with the Rally for the Republic and other Chirac supporters as the Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP). On 21 September 2002, DL voted by 15,770 votes to 2,930 to merge with the RPR and pro-Chirac elements of the UDF. The merger was completed on 17 November 2002, creating the Union for a Popular Movement.

==Ideology==

The party advocated classical liberalism: promoting less government intervention as the solution to both economic and social problems. In René Rémond&#x27;s schematic of the French right, it represented the Orléanist strain. In contrast to the &#x27;advanced liberalism&#x27; of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, which still involved social conservatism, Madelin&#x27;s was more consistently classical liberal and economically similar to Thatcherism.

On economics, DL was systematically more free-market than the UDF. In 1998, the party advocated cutting spending from 50% to 45% within five years, along with reducing the top income tax rate to 35%. Madelin had been fired as Minister of the Economy and Finances in Alain Juppé&#x27;s government for proposing cutting public sector pay and benefits. As a presidential candidate in 2002, he renewed these calls, along with widespread public sector competition and privatisation.

It was also more secular than the UDF&#x27;s centrist, Christian democratic elements from which it split, despite being dominated by well-known Catholics. Reflecting this Catholicism, the party was morally conservative, if not always conservative in social policy, and also emphasised anti-corruption, thanks particularly to judge Thierry Jean-Pierre. The party strongly opposed the dominance of École nationale d&#x27;administration in public life, with its MPs calling in 2002 for its funding to be halved.

In foreign policy, Liberal Democracy was strongly pro-American. Madelin set himself apart from the rest of the right after September 11 attacks by advocating total support for the United States.

==Political support==
After its split, Liberal Democracy gained about one-third of the UDF&#x27;s supporters. The party had significant support in rural areas.

DL&#x27;s supporters were overall wealthy, highly educated, and from a high socio-economic class, even compared to the New UDF. 42% of DL voters earned over €22,500 a year, compared to 33% of New UDF. The party was firmly backed by managers, who made up 24% of DL&#x27;s voters (18% for the New UDF); only 4% of DL voters were manual workers (13% for the New UDF). 50% of DL voters had high school diplomas, compared to 40% of New UDF voters.

==Leaders==
Throughout its existence, Alain Madelin was Liberal Democracy&#x27;s only President, with Jean-Pierre Raffarin as his Vice-President.

<doc id="323441" wikidata="Q2021395" url="?curid=323441" title="Dow theory">
<text>The Dow theory on stock price movement is a form of technical analysis that includes some aspects of sector rotation. The theory was derived from 255 editorials in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; written by Charles H. Dow (1851–1902), journalist, founder and first editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and co-founder of Dow Jones and Company. Following Dow&#x27;s death, William Peter Hamilton, Robert Rhea and E. George Schaefer organized and collectively represented Dow theory, based on Dow&#x27;s editorials. Dow himself never used the term &quot;Dow theory&quot; nor presented it as a trading system.

The six basic tenets of Dow theory as summarized by Hamilton, Rhea, and Schaefer are described below.

==Six basic tenets of Dow theory==
# The market has three movements
#: (&quot;1&quot;) The &quot;main movement&quot;, primary movement or major trend may last from less than a year to several years. It can be bullish or bearish.
#: (&quot;2&quot;) The &quot;medium swing&quot;, secondary reaction or intermediate reaction may last from ten days to three months and generally retraces from 33% to 66% of the primary price change since the previous medium swing or start of the main movement.
#: (&quot;3&quot;) The &quot;short swing&quot; or minor movement varies with opinion from hours to a month or more. The three movements may be simultaneous, for instance, a daily minor movement in a bearish secondary reaction in a bullish primary movement.
# Market trends have three phases
#: Dow theory asserts that major market trends are composed of three phases: an accumulation phase, a public participation (or absorption) phase, and a distribution phase. The accumulation phase (&quot;phase 1&quot;) is a period when investors &quot;in the know&quot; are actively buying (selling) stock against the general opinion of the market. During this phase, the stock price does not change much because these investors are in the minority demanding (absorbing) stock that the market at large is supplying (releasing). Eventually, the market catches on to these astute investors and a rapid price change occurs (&quot;phase 2&quot;). This occurs when trend followers and other technically oriented investors participate. This phase continues until rampant speculation occurs. At this point, the astute investors begin to distribute their holdings to the market (&quot;phase 3&quot;).
# The stock market discounts all news
#: Stock prices quickly incorporate new information as soon as it becomes available. Once news is released, stock prices will change to reflect this new information. On this point, Dow theory agrees with one of the premises of the efficient-market hypothesis.
# Stock market averages must confirm each other
#: In Dow&#x27;s time, the US was a growing industrial power. The US had population centers but factories were scattered throughout the country. Factories had to ship their goods to market, usually by rail. Dow&#x27;s first stock averages were an index of industrial (manufacturing) companies and rail companies. To Dow, a bull market in industrials could not occur unless the railway average rallied as well, usually first. According to this logic, if manufacturers&#x27; profits are rising, it follows that they are producing more. If they produce more, then they have to ship more goods to consumers. Hence, if an investor is looking for signs of health in manufacturers, he or she should look at the performance of the companies that ship their output to market, the railroads. The two averages should be moving in the same direction. When the performance of the averages diverge, it is a warning that change is in the air. 
#: Both &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; still publish the daily performance of the Dow Jones Transportation Average in chart form. The index contains major railroads, shipping companies, and air freight carriers in the US.
# Trends are confirmed by volume
#: Dow believed that volume confirmed price trends. When prices move on low volume, there could be many different explanations. An overly aggressive seller could be present for example. But when price movements are accompanied by high volume, Dow believed this represented the &quot;true&quot; market view. If many participants are active in a particular security, and the price moves significantly in one direction, Dow maintained that this was the direction in which the market anticipated continued movement. To him, it was a signal that a trend is developing.
# Trends exist until definitive signals prove that they have ended
#: Dow believed that trends existed despite &quot;market noise&quot;. Markets might temporarily move in the direction opposite to the trend, but they will soon resume the prior move. The trend should be given the benefit of the doubt during these reversals. Determining whether a reversal is the start of a new trend or a temporary movement in the current trend is not easy. Dow Theorists often disagree in this determination. Technical analysis tools attempt to clarify this but they can be interpreted differently by different investors.

==Analysis==

Alfred Cowles in a study in &quot;Econometrica&quot; in 1934 showed that trading based upon the editorial advice would have resulted in earning less than a buy-and-hold strategy using a well diversified portfolio. Cowles concluded that a buy-and-hold strategy produced 15.5% annualized returns from 1902 to 1929 while the Dow theory strategy produced annualized returns of 12%.

After numerous studies supported Cowles over the following years, many academics stopped studying Dow theory believing Cowles&#x27;s results were conclusive. In recent years Cowles&#x27; conclusions have been revisited. William Goetzmann, Stephen Brown, and Alok Kumar believe that Cowles&#x27; study was incomplete and that W.P. Hamilton&#x27;s application of the Dow theory from 1902 to 1929 produced excess risk-adjusted returns. Specifically, the study from Goetzman and Brown found the return of a buy-and-hold strategy was higher than that of a Dow theory portfolio by 2%, but the riskiness and volatility of the Dow theory portfolio was lower, so that the Dow theory portfolio produced higher risk-adjusted returns according to their study.

<doc id="323442" wikidata="Q6308332" url="?curid=323442" title="The Mark of the Rani">
<text>The Mark of The Rani is the third serial of the 22nd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on BBC1 on 2 and 9 February 1985.

The serial is set in the mining village of Killingworth in North East England in the 19th century. In the serial, the renegade Time Lords the Rani (Kate O&#x27;Mara) and the Master (Anthony Ainley) team up to take a chemical from humans&#x27; brains for use in the Rani&#x27;s experiments, with the Master also intending to use the brightest minds of the Industrial Revolution to make the Earth a base for himself.

==Plot==
When the Sixth Doctor and Peri arrive in the 19th-century mining town of Killingworth, they encounter a group of rampaging miners attacking people and destroying machinery. The attacks are the work of two rogue Time Lords, The Master and the Rani. The Rani&#x27;s experiments on her home planet of Miasimia Goria have left its inhabitants unable to sleep. In an attempt to fix the problem, she has begun harvesting brain fluid from the Killingworth miners and synthesising it back on Miasimia Goria. The Master wants to use the finest brains of the Industrial Revolution to help speed up Earth&#x27;s development and use the planet as a powerbase.

The Doctor sneaks into the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS, whose control room contains jars of preserved dinosaur embryos, and overhears Rani confessing to have laid landmines in nearby Redfern Dell. Simultaneously, Peri is using her botanical knowledge to make a sleeping draught for the afflicted miners, but her quest for herbs leads her to Redfern Dell. The Doctor then surprises the Master and the Rani, who are lurking at the edge of the Dell, and takes them prisoner with the Master&#x27;s own Tissue Compression Eliminator. They attempt to flee in The Rani&#x27;s TARDIS, but the Doctor has sabotaged the navigational system and velocity regulator, and the ship starts heading out of control. In the destabilised condition, one of the jars containing an embryo &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; falls to the floor and the creature begins to grow. The Master and the Rani are &quot;stuck&quot; against one of the walls of the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS due to the speed at which they are travelling and are helplessly at the mercy of the rapidly aging immature Tyrannosaurus.

The Doctor and Peri return the stolen brain fluid to prominent local citizens Lord Ravensworth and George Stephenson with instructions to administer it to the affected miners.

==Production==
The working titles for this story were &quot;Too Clever By Far&quot; and &quot;Enter The Rani&quot;.

The music score for this story was provided by composer Jonathan Gibbs. John Lewis was originally hired to compose the score, but had only completed the first episode when a sudden onset of illness – which ultimately resulted in his death – prevented him from finishing the work and forced the production team to give the assignment to Gibbs. Lewis&#x27; score for the first episode was included on the DVD release.

The serial featured extensive location filming at the Blists Hill Victorian Town and the Coalport China Museum, operated by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. Both episodes included in the credits: &quot;The BBC wish to acknowledge the cooperation of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum.&quot; This was the first story since Season 3&#x27;s &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; to feature specific historical characters, in this case landowner Lord Ravensworth and his employee George Stephenson.

==Broadcast and reception==

Writing for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Mark Braxton awarded the serial three stars out of five, describing it as &quot;a refreshing, earthbound delight in an undistinguished era of offworld futurama&quot;. He praised the location filming, the scenes between the Doctor, the Master and the Rani, and aspects of the design, such as the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS, which he said was &quot;absolutely gorgeous, quite the best piece of design in the show for an age&quot;. However, he characterized the dialogue as &quot;a mixture of wonderful and woeful&quot;, questioned the low-key presence of the historical characters, the &quot;shaky&quot; period grasp and wandering North East accents, and concluded the serial was &quot;a story of considerable interest. But little flair or sizzle&quot;.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, authors of &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot;, considered the story&#x27;s dialogue to be overblown, although the concepts were interesting. They thought the direction and music of the serial were &quot;superb&quot;, highlighting the scene where the Doctor inspected the inside of the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS as &quot;one of the few great scenes of this era&quot;. They concluded the serial was &quot;altogether rather more impressive than its reputation.&quot; In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; four out of ten, describing it as &quot;excitingly directed by newcomer Sarah Hellings&quot; but &quot;nonetheless a meandering story with some very stupid moments and the inclusion of one too many pantomime villains.&quot;

<doc id="323443" wikidata="Q1349284" url="?curid=323443" title="Sheb Wooley">
<text>Shelby Fredrick Wooley (April 10, 1921 – September 16, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He recorded a series of novelty songs including the 1958 hit rock and roll comedy single &quot;The Purple People Eater&quot; and under the name Ben Colder the country hit &quot;Almost Persuaded No. 2&quot;. As an actor, he portrayed Cletus Summers, the principal of Hickory High School and assistant coach in the 1986 film &quot;Hoosiers&quot;; Ben Miller, brother of Frank Miller in the film &quot;High Noon&quot;; Travis Cobb in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; and scout Pete Nolan in the television series &quot;Rawhide.&quot; Wooley is also credited as the voice actor who provided the Wilhelm scream and all of the other stock sound effects for Thomas J. Valentino&#x27;s Major record label during the 1940s.

==Early life==
Sheb Wooley was born in 1921 in Erick, Oklahoma, the third son of William C. Wooley and Ora E. Wooley. Wooley claimed to be part Cherokee. He had two older brothers, Logan and Hubert, as well as a younger brother, William. Federal census records for 1930 and 1940 identify Sheb&#x27;s father only as a &quot;Farmer&quot;, although the family&#x27;s livestock holdings apparently included horses, for Sheb learned to ride at an early age and became a working cowboy and later an accomplished rodeo rider.

Wooley married for the first time in 1940, wedding 17-year-old Melva Miller, a cousin of Roger Miller who would later become a successful song writer and actor himself. Wooley became friends with Miller when he lived in Oklahoma. He taught the boy how to play guitar chords and bought his first fiddle for him.

When the United States entered World War II, Wooley tried to enlist in the military but was unsuccessful due to his numerous rodeo injuries. Instead, in the early 1940s he worked in the oil industry and as a welder. In 1946 he moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he earned a living as a country-western musician recording songs and traveling for three years with a band throughout the South and Southwest. In Fort Worth he also married for the second time, to Edna Talbott Bunt, a young widow with an infant son named Gary. The three of them left Texas in 1950 and moved to Hollywood, where Wooley hoped to establish himself as an actor or singer in film or in the rapidly expanding medium of television.

==Music career==
At the age of 15, with a talent for music, Wooley formed a band called the &quot;Plainview Melody Boys&quot;, that periodically performed on radio at station KASA in Elk City, Oklahoma. He started his recording career in 1945. His music encompassed Western swing, country, hillbilly, rock and roll, pop and novelty songs. At the start of the 1950s, Wooley began fusing Western swing with rhythm and blues, but later in his career his music would shift to the more commercial Nashville sound.

In 1958, Wooley earned considerable fame with his hit rock and roll comedy single, &quot;The Purple People Eater&quot;, utilizing tape manipulation inspired by the David Seville single &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;. In the United Kingdom, he enjoyed a minor hit with the comedy single &quot;Luke the Spook&quot; on the flip side of &quot;My Only Treasure&quot;, a ballad in the country and western tradition. Wooley also had a string of country hits, with his &quot;That&#x27;s My Pa&quot; reaching No. 1 of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot C&amp;W Sides chart in March 1962. That same year, Wooley intended to record the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Indians&quot;, but he was delayed by an acting job. Meanwhile, Rex Allen recorded the song, and it was a hit. Wooley, however, would do the sequel to the song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Eskimos&quot;, about a boy in Alaska named Ben Colder (had never &quot;been colder&quot;). This sequel was so successful that Wooley continued using the name Ben Colder, with one of his later recordings being &quot;Shaky Breaky Car&quot; (which parodied the song &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;). In December 1963, his single &quot;Hootenanny Hoot&quot; became a top-10 hit in Australia; and in 1967 his song &quot;The Love-in&quot; (1967) was recognized as an acerbic commentary on the 1960s&#x27; counterculture.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wooley became a regular on the television series &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and wrote the theme song for that long-running series. On &quot;Hee Haw&quot; he often appeared as the character Ben Colder, playing him as a drunken country songwriter. Outside of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, Wooley released music and performed as Ben Colder, although he would still sing under his own name as well. Wooley continued to tour internationally and make personal concert appearances until his death in 2003. Wooley recorded his last written song just four days before he died.

==Acting career==
=== TV Westerns ===

Wooley&#x27;s work in syndicated TV series included appearances on &quot;The Range Rider&quot;, portraying outlaw Jim Younger on &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; (1954), and five appearances on &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot; (1951-1955).

He appeared in &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; episodes “Stage to Estacado” (1953); “Wake of War&quot; (1953); &quot;Message to Fort Apache&quot; (1954), and &quot;Wanted: The Lone Ranger&quot; (1955). He portrayed Bill Bronson on &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, Harry Runyon in &quot;The Unmasking&quot; on &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, and Shev Jones in &quot;The Iron Trail&quot; on &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. He appeared twice on &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;.

Wooley&#x27;s big break professionally came when he was cast as the drover Pete Nolan on &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1959–1965). Wooley also wrote and directed some of the episodes.

=== Films ===
Wooley appeared in dozens of Western films from the 1950s through the 1990s. He was in &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; (1950), and he portrayed outlaw Ben Miller in &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) and Baxter in &quot;Terror in a Texas Town&quot; (1958).

He also acted in major films, including &quot;Giant&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, &quot;Silverado&quot;, and in &quot;Hoosiers&quot;.

===The &quot;Wilhelm scream&quot;===
Sheb Wooley is also credited as the voice actor for the Wilhelm scream, having appeared on a memo as a voice extra for &quot;Distant Drums&quot; in which he had an acting role. This was later confirmed by his widow Linda Dotson. The stock recording of the distinctive scream has been used by sound-effects teams in over 200 films.

==Personal life and death==
Wooley was married five times. His first wife was Melva Miller, whom he married in 1940. Six years later he married Edna Talbott Bunt in Fort Worth, Texas. His third wife was Beverly Irene Addington. He and Beverly remained together for 19 years and adopted one daughter, Chrystie Lynn. Then, in 1985, he married Deanna Grughlin and then his manager Linda Dotson, who already had a daughter, Shauna.

Wooley was diagnosed with leukemia in 1996, which forced him to retire from public performing in 1999. He died of the illness at the age of 82 at the Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on September 16, 2003. He was entombed in Hendersonville Memory Gardens in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

==Awards==
Wooley was the recipient of numerous awards over the years for his accomplishments as a singer, actor, and writer for both comedic and dramatic productions. In 1968 he received the Country Music Association&#x27;s Comedian of the Year Award. He also received the 1992 Songwriter of the Year, two Golden Boot Awards, and he won the Western Heritage Award for nine consecutive years in recognition of his film and television work in Westerns.

<text>Enfield is a large town in north London, England, north of Charing Cross. It had a population of 333,587 in 2021. It includes the areas of Botany Bay, Brimsdown, Bulls Cross, Bullsmoor, Bush Hill Park, Clay Hill, Crews Hill, Enfield Highway, Enfield Lock, Enfield Town, Enfield Wash, Forty Hill, Freezywater, Gordon Hill, Grange Park, Hadley Wood, Ponders End, and World&#x27;s End.

South of the Hertfordshire border and M25 motorway, it borders Waltham Cross to the north, Winchmore Hill and Edmonton to the south, Chingford and Waltham Abbey, across the River Lea, to the east and north-east, with Cockfosters, Monken Hadley and Oakwood to the west.

Historically an ancient parish in the Edmonton Hundred of Middlesex, it was granted urban district status in 1894 and municipal borough status in 1955. In 1965, it merged with the municipal boroughs of Southgate and Edmonton to create the London Borough of Enfield, a local government district of Greater London, of which Enfield is the administrative centre.

Enfield Town, a market town chartered by Edward I in 1303, is the commercial centre of Enfield and the location of St Andrew&#x27;s Enfield, the original parish church. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. The east of Enfield, adjacent to the River Lea and Lee Navigation, is renowned for its industrial heritage. The Royal Small Arms Factory, at Enfield Lock, produced the famous Enfield rifles. The Brimsdown Industrial Estate is home to heavy industry, warehousing and retail, and Wright&#x27;s Flour Mill, at Ponders End, is Enfield&#x27;s oldest running industrial building. Forty Hall, on the site of the Tudor Elsyng Palace, is in the north, with Enfield Chase, the former royal hunting ground, and Chase Farm Hospital, in the west. The New River runs through Enfield from north to south, with the bypassed New River Loop encircling the town centre, through Enfield Town Park.

==History==

In Anglo-Saxon times, the manor of Enfield was held by Ansgar the Staller ( – 1085), a nobleman and staller to King Edward the Confessor (). The name &#x27;Enfield&#x27; most likely came from Old English &quot;Ēanafeld&quot; or similar, meaning &quot;open land belonging to a man called Ēana&quot;. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the manor of Enfield, spelt &#x27;Enfelde&#x27;, was the property of Geoffrey de Mandeville, a powerful Norman granted large estates by William the Conqueror. A priest is recorded in the Domesday Book as holding about 30 acres of land in Enfield, leading some to believe that a priest may have ministered there at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in this period, although the earliest written evidence of the parish church in Enfield dates from when the parish of Enfield (dedicated to St Andrew) and St Andrew&#x27;s Church were endowed to the monastery of Walden Abbey in Essex in 1136. In 1303, by charter of King Edward I, nobleman Humphrey de Bohun and his heirs were granted a licence to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs, one on St Andrew&#x27;s Day and another in September. The village green became a marketplace, making the town of Enfield (also known today as Enfield Town), at the core of the parish, a market town. The parish was the largest in Middlesex (if one excludes from the parish of Harrow on the Hill its Pinner north-west corner, which broke away in 1766); Enfield measured 12,460 acres in 1831, i.e. .

Proximity to the megalopolis of London saw Enfield &quot;engulfed&quot; by the capital in the inter-war period of the 20th century.

===Notable people, places, and events===
The parish church, located on the north side of the marketplace, is dedicated to St Andrew. While some masonry from the thirteenth century remains, the nave, north aisle, choir, and tower constructed of random rubble and flint, date from the late fourteenth century. The clerestory was added in the early sixteenth century, and the south aisle was rebuilt in brick in 1824. Adjacent to the church is the old school building of the Tudor period, Enfield Grammar School, which expanded over the years and became a large comprehensive school in the late 1960s.

====Enfield Palace====
A sixteenth century manor house, known since the eighteenth century as Enfield Palace, is remembered in the name of the Palace Gardens Shopping Centre (and the hothouses on the site were once truly notable; see below). It was used as a private school from around 1670 until the late nineteenth century. The last remains of it were demolished in 1928 to make way for an extension to Pearson&#x27;s department store, though a panelled room with an elaborate plaster ceiling and a stone fireplace survive, relocated to a house in Gentleman&#x27;s Row, a street of sixteenth- to eighteenth-century houses near the town centre.

====Enfield Market====
In 1303, King Edward I granted a charter to Humphrey de Bohun and his wife to hold a weekly market in Enfield each Monday, and James I granted another in 1617, to a charitable trust, for a Saturday market. The market was still prosperous in the early eighteenth century, but fell into decline soon afterwards. There were sporadic attempts to revive it: an unsuccessful one of 1778 is recorded, and in 1826 a stone Gothic market cross was erected to replace the octagonal wooden market house, demolished sixteen years earlier. In 1858 J. Tuff wrote of the market: &quot;several attempts have been made to revive it, the last of which, about twenty years ago, also proved a failure, It has again fallen into desuetude and will probably never be revived&quot;.

However, the trading resumed in the 1870s. In 1904 a new wooden structure was built to replace the stone cross, by now decayed. The market is still in existence, administered by the Old Enfield Charitable trust.

====The Enfield Fair====
The charter of 1303 also gave the right to hold two annual fairs, one on St Andrew&#x27;s Day and the other in September. The latter was suppressed in 1869 at the request of local tradesmen, clergy and other prominent citizens, having become, according to the local historian Pete Eyre, &quot;a source of immorality and disorder, and a growing nuisance to the inhabitants&quot;.

====The New River====
The New River, built to supply water to London from Hertfordshire, runs immediately behind the town centre through the Town Park, which is the last remaining public open-space of Enfield Old Park. The Enfield Loop of the New River also passes through the playing fields of Enfield Grammar School, and this is the only stretch of the loop without a public footpath on at least one side of it.

====Hothouses====
Enfield was the location of some of the earliest successful hothouses, developed by Dr Robert Uvedale (1642–1722), headmaster both of Enfield Grammar School and of the Palace School. He was a Cambridge scholar and renowned horticulturalist; George Simonds Boulger writes of Uvedale in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, 1885–1900, Volume 58:

As a horticulturist Uvedale earned a reputation for his skill in cultivating exotics, being one of the earliest possessors of hothouses in England. In an &quot;Account of Several Gardens Near London&quot; written by J. Gibson in 1691 (&quot;Archæologia&quot;, 1794, xii. 188), the writer says: &quot;Dr. Uvedale of Enfield is a great lover of plants, and, having an extraordinary art in managing them, is become master of the greatest and choicest collection of exotic greens that is perhaps anywhere in this land. His greens take up six or seven houses or roomsteads. His orange-trees and largest myrtles fill up his biggest house, and ... those more nice and curious plants that need closer keeping are in warmer rooms, and some of them stoved when he thinks fit. His flowers are choice, his stock numerous, and his culture of them very methodical and curious.&quot;

====John Keats====
The poet John Keats (1795-1821) attended progressive Clarke&#x27;s School in Enfield, where he began a translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. The school&#x27;s building later became Enfield Town railway station, but was demolished in 1872. The current building was erected in the 1960s. In 1840 the first section of the Northern and Eastern Railway had been opened from Stratford to Broxbourne. The branch line from Water Lane to Enfield Town station was opened in 1849.

====Silver Street White House====
The White House in Silver Street – now a doctors&#x27; surgery – was the home of Joseph Whitaker, publisher and founder of &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot;; he lived there from 1820 until his death in 1895. (Inscription on Blue Plaque on The White House, Silver Street, Enfield.)

====World&#x27;s first ATM====
Enfield Town had the world&#x27;s first cash machine or automatic teller machine, invented by John Shepherd-Barron. It was installed at the local branch of Barclays Bank on 27 June 1967 and was opened by actor and Enfield resident Reg Varney.

====The Civic Centre====
Enfield Town houses the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the Borough administration, where Council and committee meetings are also held.

==Demography==
Neighbourhoods and villages of Enfield include: Botany Bay, Brimsdown, Bulls Cross, Bullsmoor, Bush Hill Park, Clay Hill, Crews Hill, Enfield Highway, Enfield Lock, Enfield Wash, Forty Hill, Freezywater, Gordon Hill, Grange Park, Ponders End, and World&#x27;s End. The official estimate of Enfield&#x27;s population is 156,858 as of 2018, counted from 10 electoral wards that make up Enfield.

In the 2011 census, the Town ward (covering areas north from the Southbury Road) was 82% white (68% British, 10% Other, 3% Irish). The largest non-white group, Black African, claimed 3%. The District is also covered by the Chase, Highlands, Grange, Southbury, Lock, Highway, Turkey Street and Bush Hill Park wards. Of these, the Lock ward had the highest minority proportion, 45.1% of its population.

Highlands ward had the highest male and female life expectancies from 2009 to 2013, 82.5 and 87.2 years respectively. The lowest was 76.7 years in Enfield Lock, and 81.4 years in Chase, respectively.

Enfield Lock is the only ward where most houses were rented, 50.1%. At the opposite end, in Bush Hill Park 78.5% of houses were owned by the household.

==Sport==
The town is home to two association football teams: Enfield Football Club, formed in 1893, reformed in 2007, and currently based at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford; and Enfield Town Football Club, a breakaway club of Enfield F.C. formed in 2001 and currently based at Enfield&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II Stadium.

Enfield Town L.F.C. is Enfield Town&#x27;s women&#x27;s football club, also based at the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium.

North Enfield Cricket Club was formed in 1886, and has been based at Clay Hill since 1945.

==Locale and transport==
Enfield Town is north of Charing Cross—the centre point of London—and is about south-west of Cheshunt, south-east of Potters Bar, and east of Barnet.

===Rail===
At the centre of Enfield Town is Enfield Town railway station, one of three northern termini of the Lea Valley lines to Liverpool Street in the City of London, with services operated by London Overground. On the Enfield Town branch line between Enfield Town and Edmonton Green is Bush Hill Park.

The Southbury Loop separates from the Enfield Town branch line between Bush Hill Park and Edmonton Green stations, towards Cheshunt. The loop runs through Southbury and Turkey Street stations in Enfield, at which London Overground services between Liverpool Street and Cheshunt call.

The West Anglia Main Line, also one of the Lea Valley lines, runs through Ponders End, Brimsdown and Enfield Lock stations. Services are operated by Greater Anglia to Liverpool Street, Stratford, Hertford East and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford.

Enfield Chase railway station on Windmill Hill, west of the town centre, is on the Hertford Loop line, with services to Moorgate, Hertford North, Watton-at-Stone and Stevenage operated by Thameslink. Also on this line are Crews Hill, Gordon Hill and Grange Park.

===Buses===
London Buses routes 121, 191, 192, 217, 231, 279, 299, 307, 313, 317, 329, 349, 377, 456, 629, W8, W9, W10, night routes N29 and N279, and non-London routes 610, 611 and 629 serve Enfield.

==In popular culture==
Enfield and its clock tower are important locations in the 2016 young adult novel &quot;Timekeeper&quot; by Tara Sim.

The Enfield poltergeist (a claim of alleged poltergeist activity in Brimsdown, Enfield between 1977 and 1979), was dramatized in the 2016 horror film &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot;. The story also attracted press coverage in British newspapers, and has been mentioned in books, and television and radio documentaries.

The Barclays Bank in the main town was the site of the first cash machine in the world.

<doc id="323445" wikidata="Q3470556" url="?curid=323445" title="Time and the Rani">
<text>Time and the Rani is the first serial of the 24th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 7 to 28 September 1987. It was the first to feature Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. 

In the serial, the renegade Time Lady the Rani (Kate O&#x27;Mara) brings the greatest geniuses from time and space to her laboratory on the planet Lakertya so she can use their minds to power her time manipulator.

==Plot==

Whilst in flight, the TARDIS is attacked by the Rani, an amoral scientist and renegade Time Lord. The TARDIS crash-lands on the planet Lakertya. On the floor of the console room, the Sixth Doctor regenerates into the Seventh Doctor. In his post-regenerative confusion the Doctor is separated from Mel and tricked into assisting the Rani in her megalomaniac scheme to construct a giant time manipulator.

Lost on the barren surface of the planet, Mel has to avoid the Rani&#x27;s ingenious traps and her monstrous, bat-like servants, the Tetraps. She joins forces with a rebel Lakertyan, Ikona, desperate to end the Rani&#x27;s control of his planet. The Doctor must recover his wits in time to avoid becoming a permanent part of the Rani&#x27;s plan to collect the genius of the greatest scientific minds in the universe, of which she has captured many including Albert Einstein, in order that she can create a time manipulator, which would allow the Rani to control time anywhere in the universe, at the expense of all life on Lakertya.

The Doctor manages to foil her plan and free the Lakertyans of her evil control. The Rani escapes in her TARDIS, but it has been commandeered by the Tetraps, who take her prisoner. The Doctor takes all the captured geniuses on board his TARDIS so that he can return them home.

==Production==
This story&#x27;s working title was &quot;Strange Matter&quot;. The story was initially written for Colin Baker and the Sixth Doctor, with the opening scene, intended to be a depiction of the Judgement of Solomon, dropped to accommodate the regeneration.

===Cast notes===
Wanda Ventham and Donald Pickering previously appeared together in &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;. Donald Pickering also appeared in &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot;. Wanda Ventham also appeared in &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot;. Due to Colin Baker refusing to reprise his role as the Sixth Doctor, Sylvester McCoy donned a wig for the regeneration effect.

===Broadcast and reception===
Reviewing &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, Tat Wood criticised the story&#x27;s dialogue and plot, but praised the direction as &quot;visually impressive&quot;. A 2014 poll held by 
&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; as the third worst story in the show&#x27;s run, behind only &quot;Fear Her&quot; and &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot;.

Newly appointed script editor Andrew Cartmel said there were many things he disliked about the script, which he felt lacked depth: &quot;This was a story which wasn&#x27;t about anything—and, frustratingly, it was Sylvester McCoy&#x27;s debut.&quot; Cartmel also stated that the Bakers’ scripts were also disliked by other members of the cast and crew including producer John Nathan-Turner.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Pip and Jane Baker, was published by Target Books in December 1987. The novel features a longer finale for the Sixth Doctor (and reveals that the regeneration into the Seventh Doctor was caused by &quot;tumultuous buffeting&quot; when the Rani attacked the TARDIS), while the Tetraps seem to speak English backwards.

===Home media===
&quot;Time and the Rani&quot; was released on VHS by BBC Worldwide in July 1995. It was released on region 2 DVD on 13 September 2010, and on region 1 DVD on 14 June 2011. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 99 on 17 October 2012.

In June 2021 it was released as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection Season 24 blu-ray box set, which includes an optional extended cut of all four episodes.

===Soundtrack===
Keff McCulloch&#x27;s music from this serial was released on CD 24 November 2023.

<text>Bonita Melody Lysette Langford (born 22 July 1964) is an English actress, dancer and singer. She came to prominence as a child star in the 1970s, when she had a notable role in the TV series &quot;Just William&quot;.

In the 1980s, she played companion Mel Bush in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a role she returned to in the 2020s. She has also been known for appearing in various musicals in the West End and on Broadway, including shows such as &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. She also appeared as a contestant on &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in 2006 and 2014. From 2015 to 2018, she played Carmel Kazemi on the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, for which she received the 2016 British Soap Award for Best Newcomer.

== Early life and career ==
Langford was born on 22 July 1964 in Middlesex, and grew up in Surrey. She attended the Arts Educational School, St Catherine&#x27;s School, Twickenham and the Italia Conti Academy stage school. She first came to public attention when, aged six years old, she won the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. This led to the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s daughter in the London production of &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1972), and work in the 1974 Broadway revival of &quot;Gypsy&quot; starring Angela Lansbury, in the 1976 film &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, the 1977 film &quot;Wombling Free&quot;, and to still greater fame playing Violet Elizabeth Bott in the 1977–78 television series &quot;Just William&quot;. During this time, she was appearing as a regular on a children&#x27;s prime-time show made by Yorkshire Television called &quot;Junior Showtime&quot;, along with child stars Lena Zavaroni, Neil Reid, Perry Cree, and Glynn Poole among others.

==Career==
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

Between 1986 and 1987, Langford played the role of Mel, companion to both the Sixth and Seventh Doctors in the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She returned to the role in 1993 for &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, a special charity &quot;Doctor Who&quot;/&quot;EastEnders&quot; crossover episode as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot;. She has continued to reprise the role in several audio dramas alongside the Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy Doctors and in a cameo in the episode &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. In her first appearances one of her trademarks was a penetrating scream uttered while escaping from monsters.

In 2023, it was announced that Langford would be returning to the series in the revival’s fourteenth series, reprising her role as a guest star, alongside Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor and Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday. The two episodes were broadcast in June 2024

===Dancing===
Langford was a featured dancer in BBC One&#x27;s popular light entertainment series &quot;The Hot Shoe Show&quot; which she co-presented with Wayne Sleep. On 23 October 2005, she performed in &quot;Children Will Listen&quot;, a 75th birthday tribute to Stephen Sondheim at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. She is also a panto regular; recent credits include Peter in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Richmond Theatre in Richmond, London (2008–2009); and Fairy Snow in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford (2013–2014).

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===
In 2006, Langford was a celebrity contestant in the first series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, partnering professional figure skater Matt Evers. Their routines were characterised by the dramatic lifts and tricks they performed and were amongst the most ambitious in the competitions. Viewers saw her bang her head as she was spun on the ice during rehearsals, illustrating the danger of some of the moves they were attempting. Their appearances were also notable for the differing reception they received from the panel of judges (which consistently voted them highly, awarding them the highest total scores and the only two maximum scores from individual judges) and the voting public (who twice placed them in the bottom two pairs, forcing a &quot;skate off&quot; to remain in the competition). They finished in third place overall.

Langford and Evers appeared again on the programme in the one-off &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; show which followed series two. They were scored second overall by the judging panel but again the public vote was less favourable and they were amongst the four teams eliminated in the first round of the competition. Langford then toured with &quot;Torvill and Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice: The Tour&quot; in 2007.

Langford took part in the Dancing on Ice: The Tour in April and May 2008.

In 2014, Langford returned to &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; for the ninth and final series (10 Week run), which saw the return of contestants from previous series. This time she was partnered with professional ice skater Andrei Lipanov. She was eliminated in Week 5 after losing out to Sam Attwater and his fiancé Vicky Ogden. In February 2014 she was announced as one of eight celebrities that would be appearing in &quot;Torvill &amp; Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice: The Final Tour&quot; between March &amp; April 2014.

===Stage and television work===
Langford&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; reinvigorated her career. She returned to the West End theatre in 2006 playing the role of Roxie Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot;.

In 2006 and 2007, Langford appeared in the Birmingham and Plymouth tours of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; playing Miss Adelaide Adams, a dance hall hostess.

In July 2007, Langford was a judge on the ITV series &quot;Baby Ballroom: The Championship&quot;.

In 2009 and 2010, she again appeared in &quot;Chicago&quot; as Roxie Hart.

Langford played the role of Roz in the first UK tour production of the Broadway musical, &quot;9 to 5&quot;, which was launched at the Opera House, Manchester on 12 October 2012.

In 2018 she took over the leading role of Dorothy Brock in the West End revival of 42nd Street, until the show closed on 5 January 2019; a recording from the end of the 2018 run aired as part of PBS&#x27;s Great Performances’ third annual “Broadway’s Best” lineup in November 2019.

In 2021, Langford appeared on &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;, masked as Squirrel. She reached the final and was announced as the runner up on 5 June.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===

On 5 April 2015, it was announced that Langford had joined long-running BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; for a guest role, later promoted to a regular role as character Carmel Kazemi, the mother of established character, Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami). Carmel is described as an &quot;overly protective&quot; and &quot;outspoken&quot; mother. Commenting on the casting, Langford said: &quot;I’m so thrilled and delighted to be part of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. I’m a great fan of the show and think the recent 30th Anniversary was sensational and shows just how good British television can be. To be part of this family is an absolute privilege.&quot;

==Personal life==
Langford is the aunt of actresses Summer, Scarlett, Zizi, and Saskia Strallen.

In 1995, she married Paul Grunert, with whom she has one daughter. They divorced in 2015.

<text>The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (, &quot;HaLishka HaMerkazit LiStatistika&quot;; ), abbreviated CBS, is an Israeli government office established in 1949 to carry out research and publish statistical data on all aspects of Israeli life, including population, society, economy, industry, education, and physical infrastructure.

The CBS is headquartered in the Givat Shaul neighborhood of Jerusalem, with another branch in Tel Aviv.

==Overview==
The CBS is headed by the National Statistician (previously named Government Statistician), who is appointed on the recommendation of the prime minister. Professor Emeritus Danny Pfefferman of Hebrew University has served in that position and as Director of the CBS since 2013. The bureau&#x27;s annual budget in 2011 was NIS 237 million.

The work of the CBS follows internationally accepted standards which enable comparison of statistical information with other countries. It gathers current, monthly, quarterly and annually data on the national economy (production, consumption, capital formation, labor productivity, savings), the balance of payments and foreign trade, the activity of different economic branches (agriculture, manufacturing, construction, transport, commerce and services, etc.), the price of goods and services, the population, family size, employment, education, health, crime, government services and more. The CBS also conducts a Census of Population and Housing every ten years, as well as periodic and one-time surveys on a variety of subjects.

The work of CBS is overseen by the Public Commission of Statistics. The data is disseminated in a wide variety of publications, among them the Statistical Abstract of Israel. Current and updated statistical information is brought to the public&#x27;s attention through daily press releases. Government ministries use the data collected by CBS for policymaking, planning and tracking development. The data is also made available to academic research institutions and the general public.

<doc id="323463" wikidata="Q1931785" url="?curid=323463" title="A Thousand Leaves">
<text>A Thousand Leaves is the tenth studio album by American rock band Sonic Youth, released on CD and cassette on May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. A double-LP vinyl issue had been released three weeks earlier, on April 21, 1998, by My So Called Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album recorded at their own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was built with the money they had made at the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. Since the band had an unlimited amount of time to work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed unevenly. The highly experimental extended plays &quot;Anagrama&quot;, &quot;Slaapkamers met slagroom&quot;, and &quot;Invito al ĉielo&quot; were recorded simultaneously with the album.

&quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; reached number 85 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the lengthy, quiet guitar interplay between band members Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo. However, some criticized the forced vocal delivery of member Kim Gordon and found several tracks to be unnecessarily long and poorly constructed. The song &quot;Sunday&quot; was released as a single with a music video directed by Harmony Korine and starring American actor Macaulay Culkin.

==Background and recording==
&quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; is the follow-up to Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Washing Machine&quot;, which was released shortly after the band concluded their stint headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. With the money they had made at the festival, the band decided to build a recording studio, called Echo Canyon, on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan. The span of nearly three years between &quot;Washing Machine&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; also represented the longest gap between studio albums in Sonic Youth&#x27;s career at the time. Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore explained that the band needed a break, noting that they had been touring non-stop for 16 years. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re having children, we&#x27;re getting older, let&#x27;s just cool out a little bit and build this workshop, and go that way, work that route.&quot; In their new studio, the band began writing new songs from extended improvisations in rehearsal. Several instrumental jams were released as extended plays through the band&#x27;s own record label, Sonic Youth Recordings, and distributed by Smells Like Records, an independent record label previously formed by drummer Steve Shelley. These include &quot;Anagrama&quot;, &quot;Slaapkamers met slagroom&quot; and &quot;Invito al ĉielo&quot;.

Since &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; was the first Sonic Youth album that was recorded in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from an early stage of development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is &quot;a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren&#x27;t into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn&#x27;t feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like &quot;Goo&quot;.&quot; The 11-minute song &quot;Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)&quot; was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and &quot;Confusion Is Sex&quot; producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; was considered more expansive and relaxed than previous Sonic Youth albums, with less feedback and more guitar playing and improvisation. According to David Browne, the record explored post-rock sounds that were &quot;subtler&quot; and &quot;quirkier&quot; than most mainstream rock at the time. The title of the album was inspired by Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. According to Moore, &quot;The same way he improvises with images and words, we improvise with sounds and notes&quot;. He also attributed the style of the album to the fact that the band was getting older, commenting, &quot;You also become much involved with your thoughts about life experience in general. Having children is incredible in that way.&quot; The song &quot;Snare, Girl&quot; explored these topics. The longest song on the album, &quot;Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)&quot;, referenced American poet Allen Ginsberg and contains an instrumental interlude that was described as &quot;a subtle, drawn-out passage of Morse code guitar lines and lazy afternoon with wah-wah pedal licks—bliss in slow motion.&quot;

Like previous Sonic Youth albums, &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; also contains songs that deal with gender roles and stereotypes. The song &quot;Female Mechanic Now on Duty&quot;, sung by band member Kim Gordon, was a reaction to how journalists categorize female musicians. It was inspired by Meredith Brooks&#x27;s hit &quot;Bitch&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;The Ineffable Me&quot;, Gordon expressed her opposition to such limitations. The song &quot;Karen Koltrane&quot;, sung by Ranaldo, is about a lover from his college days who had &quot;a far less extraordinary adulthood&quot; than he had first thought, while &quot;Hoarfrost&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Woodland Ode&quot;, was inspired when Ranaldo and his wife Leah Singer went for a walk in the snow during a visit they made to Singer&#x27;s parents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The track &quot;Sunday&quot; is generally considered the album&#x27;s most accessible song. It was originally recorded for Richard Linklater&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, but was later re-recorded for &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; was released on vinyl, CD, and cassette formats on May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. The album cover features an artwork by artist Marnie Weber, which depicts a hamster and Weber herself at age 12 sporting animal horns. According to Moore, the image is a reference to the &quot;Unlimited Edition&quot; compilation album by German experimental rock band Can. Originally, the album was titled &quot;Mille Feuille&quot; (French for &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot;) and was intended to feature an image of Moore holding a pastry as the cover art. To promote the album, a radio edit version of &quot;Sunday&quot; was released as a single to modern rock, college, and public radio in April 1998. The band also supported the album with a tour across the US and Canada from May to June 1998.

Upon release, &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; reached No. 85 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 38 on the UK Albums Chart. The album also charted in other countries, including France, Belgium, Sweden and Norway. The single &quot;Sunday&quot; reached No. 72 in the UK Singles Chart and was eventually released on vinyl and CD on July 14, 1998, containing a Nirvana cover, &quot;Moist Vagina&quot;, as one of its B-sides. A music video directed by Harmony Korine and starring Macaulay Culkin was made for the single. The band chose Korine due to his work on the films &quot;Kids&quot; (1995) and &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997), the first of which featured several young actors who previously appeared in the music video for the band&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Sugar Kane&quot;, including American actress Chloë Sevigny. As of July 1999, the album had sold 54,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. And as of 2005, the album had sold 66,000 copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; was well received by critics, some of whom regarded it as one of Sonic Youth&#x27;s best albums yet. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as &quot;the band&#x27;s most challenging and satisfying record in years&quot; and praised its quiet guitars and unpredictable twists, which kept the lengthy songs captivating. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; editor Brent DiCrescenzo cited &quot;Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)&quot; as the album&#x27;s centerpiece and highlighted the album&#x27;s jamming, improvising, and guitar interplay between Moore and Ranaldo. David Stubbs of &quot;Spin&quot; criticized Gordon&#x27;s weak singing and forced guitar playing on &quot;Contre le sexisme&quot;, &quot;Female Mechanic Now on Duty&quot;, and &quot;The Ineffable Me&quot;, but nevertheless judged the &quot;continually inventive fretboard effects&quot; of Moore and Ranaldo, which &quot;[sparkle] gold-plating adornments that cut open and irritate [the album] at every turn.&quot;

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. Sara Scribner from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; was a monotonous &quot;experimental, psychedelic record&quot; that felt &quot;like a passionless, less thoughtful shadow of [the band&#x27;s] former self&quot;. J.D. Considine of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated similar cons, calling the record &quot;the sort of thing that gives art rock a bad name.&quot; Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the songs to be unnecessarily long and sluggish, commenting that the album &quot;really does sound like a demo — eleven songs waiting for better organization and cliché removal&quot;. Similarly, Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that the album rarely contained fully formed songs and that the band should start &quot;completing its ideas before recording them for posterity.&quot; &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; criticized Gordon&#x27;s &quot;contrived and annoying&quot; vocal delivery, saying that many songs are &quot;merely lengthy feedback collages with pasted-on vocals and gobs of art-school pretension&quot;, but also admitted that the album contains some &quot;hidden gems&quot; like &quot;Sunday&quot; and &quot;Wildflower Soul&quot;.

In a very positive review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau called &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; a mature and beautiful record, commenting: &quot;It&#x27;s the music of a daydream nation old enough to treasure whatever time it finds on its hands. Where a decade ago [Sonic Youth] plunged and plodded, drunk on the forward notion of the van they were stuck in, here they wander at will, dazzled by sunshine, greenery, hoarfrost and machines that go squish in the night.&quot; Although the album was not ranked in the Top 40 of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1998, Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, placed it at No. 3 in his own &quot;Dean&#x27;s List&quot;. He would later name it one of the 10 best records of the 1990s. Similarly, the editors of &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at No. 40 in their year-end top 50 list. &quot;The Wire&quot; named the album its record of the year in its year-end critics&#x27; poll.

<doc id="323466" wikidata="Q827415" url="?curid=323466" title="Union for French Democracy">
<text>The Union for French Democracy ( , UDF) was a centre-right political party in France. The UDF was founded in 1978 as an electoral alliance to support President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in order to counterbalance the Gaullist preponderance over the French centre-right. The UDF took its name from Giscard&#x27;s 1976 book, &quot;Démocratie française&quot;.

The founding parties of the UDF were Giscard&#x27;s Republican Party (PR), the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS), the Radical Party (Rad), the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Perspectives and Realities Clubs (CPR). The UDF was most frequently a junior partner in coalitions with the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR). In 1998 the UDF became a single entity, causing the defection of Liberal Democracy (DL), PR&#x27;s successor. In 2002 the RPR, DL and most of the remaining UDF members joined the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which aimed to unite the entire centre-right. The UDF effectively ceased to exist by the end of 2007 and its membership and assets were transferred to its successor, the Democratic Movement (MoDem). The UDF&#x27;s last president and MoDem&#x27;s founding leader was François Bayrou.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
In the 1974 presidential election, defying expectations, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, leader of the Independent Republicans, was elected President of France by overcoming Jacques Chaban-Delmas of the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR), the largest centre-right party, in the first round and defeating François Mitterrand in the run-off. Two years later, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac (UDR) resigned and launched the Rally for the Republic (RPR), in order to restore the Gaullist domination over the centre-right. The RPR would represent the right-wing of the presidential majority and would criticise with virulence the policies put forward by President Giscard and Prime Minister Raymond Barre.

In the run-up of the 1978 legislative election, during a speech in Verdun-sur-le-Doubs, Giscard noted that the political leanings of the French people were divided among four groups: the Communist Party (PCF), the Socialist Party (PS), the neo-Gaullist RPR and his own camp, which lacked a cohesive representation. Therefore, he sought to formally organise the centrist side of the presidential majority through the UDF. It consisted of the conservative-liberal Republican Party (PR) – the evolution of Giscard&#x27;s Independent Republicans –, the Christian-democratic Centre of Social Democrats (CDS), the liberal Radical Party (Rad), the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Perspectives and Realities Clubs (CPR). Contrary to the RPR, the UDF advocated less market interventionism by the state, decentralisation and support of local authorities, and a strong commitment towards the building of a federal Europe. According to historian René Rémond, the UDF descended from the Orleanist tradition of the right, whereas the RPR was a reincarnation of the Bonapartist tradition, which promoted national independence by virtue of a strong state.

After the centre-right won the 1978 legislative election and the subsequent focus of both the RPR and the UDF toward the 1981 presidential election, their relations deteriorated. Especially, RPR leader Chirac criticised the market-oriented and pro-European policies of Giscard and Barre. In the run-up of the 1979 European Parliament election, Chirac published the Call of Cochin where the UDF was accused of being &quot;the party of foreigners&quot;. Since the UDF list, led by Simone Veil, obtained 27.1% of the vote compared with RPR&#x27;s 16.3%, the quarrels between the two parties and the rivalry between Giscard and Chirac contributed to the defeat of the incumbent president who ran for a second term.

===1980s===
After the election of Mitterrand as president, the two centre-right parties reconciled. Gradually, the RPR abandoned Gaullist doctrine and joined the market-oriented and pro-European positions of the UDF. Although they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election, their leaders Chirac and Barre still competed for the leadership of the French centre-right. Focused on winning the 1986 legislative election, Chirac, unlike Barre, accepted the principle of &quot;cohabitation&quot; with President Mitterrand. Furthermore, some UDF politicians (notably from the PR) covertly supported Chirac. Consequently, he served as Prime Minister from 1986 to 1988 and the UDF played a supporting role in his government.

Barre was a candidate in the 1988 presidential election, yet, despite his popularity, he was not supported by all UDF leaders. Giscard himself refused to choose clearly and publicly between his two former Prime Ministers. Eliminated in the first round, Barre called on his supporters to vote for Chirac in the second round, but despite this, Chirac was defeated by Mitterrand. After the re-election of Mitterrand, some UDF members participated as ministers in the centre-left governments led by Prime Minister Michel Rocard.

Also in 1988 Giscard retook the leadership of the UDF. However, his authority and that of the other centre-right leaders (Chirac, Barre etc.) were contested by a new generation of politicians called the &quot;renovation men&quot;, who accused the old guard leadership of bearing responsibility for the successive electoral defeats. However, Giscard would give the party a more consistent centre-right approach, that would culminate in the entire UDF joining the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), which had been previously home only of the Christian-democratic CDS, in 1994.

===1990s===
With the dismissal of Rocard in 1991 there were no longer UDF ministers from the government, thus RPR and the UDF were allied in opposition to the subsequent Socialist governments which were weakened by economic crisis, scandals and internal quarrels. The RPR–UDF coalition named &quot;Union for France&quot; comfortably won the 1993 legislative election and obtained a massive majority in the National Assembly. The new Prime Minister Édouard Balladur, who hailed from the RPR, nominated a large number of UDF members to his cabinet: François Léotard (PR) became minister of Defense, Gérard Longuet (PR) of Industry, Pierre Méhaignerie (CDS) of Justice, François Bayrou (CDS) of Education, Simone Veil (PR) of Health and Social Affairs, Alain Madelin (PR) of Commerce, Bernard Bosson (CDS) of Transport, Jean Puech (CDS) of Agriculture, André Rossinot (Rad) of Civil Service and Hervé de Charette (CPR) of Housing.

In the run-up of the 1995 presidential election the different components of the UDF were unable to agree on a common candidacy and consequently they divided between the two RPR candidates. Most UDF members supported Balladur, whereas a minority endorsed Chirac, as Giscard had proposed. In the aftermath, the CDS merged with the PSD into Democratic Force (FD), while CPR members and other supporters of Giscard within the PR formed the Popular Party for French Democracy (PPDF).

After Chirac&#x27;s election as president of France, some UDF ministers were dismissed as a result of their support for Balladur. Nevertheless, in Alain Juppé&#x27;s cabinet, the UDF was given several ministries including Foreign Affairs with Hervé de Charette (PPDF), Defense with Charles Millon (PR), Economy and Finances with Alain Madelin (PR), Industry with Yves Galland (Rad), Education with François Bayrou (CDS/FD), Commerce with Jean-Pierre Raffarin (PR), Labour with Jacques Barrot (CDS/FD), Agriculture with Philippe Vasseur (CDS/FD), Culture with Philippe Douste-Blazy (CDS/FD), Economic Development with Jean Arthuis (PR) and Reform and Decentralization with Claude Goasguen (PR).

In 1996 François Léotard, a Republican and a former &quot;balladurien&quot;, was elected president of the UDF by defeating Alain Madelin, who was also a Republican, but had supported Chirac. After the defeat of the RPR–UDF front in the 1997 legislative election, the UDF faced a major crisis. While the centrist components had merged into FD, the conservative liberals tried to overcome the fracture between &quot;chiraquiens&quot; and &quot;balladuriens&quot;. The PR was joined by some politicians from the PPDF, such as Jean-Pierre Raffarin (a former Republican), and was renamed Liberal Democracy (DL), under Madelin&#x27;s leadership. DL soon began to reassert its autonomy within the alliance and finally broke ranks with the UDF in 1998. The split was triggered by the 1998 regional elections, during which some UDF politicians were elected regional presidents with the support of the National Front: DL refused to condemn the arrangement, whilst the UDF leadership did.

===New UDF===
This split of DL led to a re-organisation of the UDF. The &quot;nouvelle UDF&quot; (new UDF) was transformed into a single party through the merger of FD and the Independent Republican and Liberal Pole (PRIL), formed by those DL members who refused to leave UDF. The Radicals and the PPDF remained as autonomous entities within the new party.

Former FD leader Bayrou became the natural leader of the new UDF. He conceived it as the embryo of a future centrist party which would include politicians from both the left and right. Bayrou ran for president in the 2002 presidential election, but some UDF leaders supported Chirac. The latter won re-election comfortably, with Bayrou being eliminated after the first round, having gained only 6.8% of the vote. Bayrou subsequently refused Chirac&#x27;s invitation to join the newly-formed centre-right, big-tent Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) for the upcoming 2002 legislative election. Other UDF members, led by Giscard, Barrot, Douste-Blazy, Méhaignerie and Raffarin, as well as the entire PPDF and DL, joined the UMP, leaving Bayrou somewhat isolated.

After the election, the UDF, whose parliamentary seats were quite reduced, joined the victorious UMP as a partner in the government of Prime Minister Raffarin. Despite this, the UDF sometimes criticised its policies, without initially quitting the majority coalition and entering the opposition, which was made up mostly of centre-left and left-wing parties. The UDF eft the government, except for Gilles de Robien, only after a cabinet reshuffle in March 2004, but still decided to remain in the parliamentary majority coalition.

At the European level, the UDF left the EPP and formed the European Democratic Party (EDP), along with Italy&#x27;s Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy. The EDP was intended to be the home to all the Christian democrats and centrists who were disillusioned by the new course of the EPP, which had welcomed the RPR and, later, the UMP. With the exit of most of its conservative, Christian-democratic and conservative-liberal components in 1998 and 2002, the UDF was thus a centrist party with socially liberal tendencies, in Bayrou&#x27;s mould.

There developed a split among UDF elected officials, between those such as de Robien and Pierre-Christophe Baguet, who favored closer ties with the UMP, and those such as Bayrou who advocate independent centrist policies, while others such as Jean Dionis du Séjour tried steering for a middle course. The most likely reason for many of the UDF&#x27;s elected officials favouring close ties with the UMP was that most of the UDF&#x27;s elected positions were obtained through cooperative alliances with the UMP. However, the party&#x27;s base overwhelmingly favored independence. At the congress of Lyon, in January 2006, 91% of the members voted to retain the independence of the UDF from the UMP and transform it into an independent centrist party. This outcome meant that the orientation of the evolving UDF would be that of a social-liberal party aiming for a balance between social-democratic and conservative policies.

===Democratic Movement===
In May 2006 Bayrou and other ten UDF deputies, a minority within the parliamentary party, voted for the motion of no-confidence brought forward by the Socialist-led opposition calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin&#x27;s government, embroiled in the Clearstream affair. This motion had no chance of being passed, given that the UMP had an absolute majority in the National Assembly. Following this event, France&#x27;s television authority started to classify Bayrou and the other UDF deputies who had voted for the motion as being in the opposition for time allocation purposes; however, after Bayrou protested, they were classified as neither majority nor opposition.

In April 2007 Bayrou announced that he would be submitting a plan to a vote by UDF members to create a new Democratic Movement (MoDem), which was finally launched in May. However, most of the UDF&#x27;s deputies protested and formed the New Centre (NC) – later The Centrists –, in order to support newly-elected President Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP. In the subsequent 2007 legislative election held in June, the MoDem won 7.6% of the vote and three seats, while the NC stopped at 2.4%, but, thanks to its alliance with the UMP, obtained 22 seats.

In November 2007 the UDF effectively ceased to exist and was fully integrated within the MoDem, headed by Bayrou.

==Ideology, positions, platform==
The UDF was a centre-right party, although it considered itself centrist. Broadly, the UDF was a big tent, bringing together Christian democrats, liberals, radicals, social democrats and non-Gaullist conservatives. The main ideological trends in the party were Christian democracy, liberalism, conservative liberalism and liberal conservatism.

The UDF&#x27;s most marked political trait was pro-Europeanism and support for European integration, up to the point of turning the European Union into a federal United States of Europe. In that respect, UDF was the likely target of Chirac&#x27;s Call of Cochin (1978), in which he denounced the pro-European policies of &quot;the party of the foreigners&quot;.

Until 2002, the UDF spanned a somewhat wide ideological spectrum on the centre-right. A tongue-in-cheek characterisation of UDF&#x27;s membership is that it was the union of everybody on the right that was neither far-right nor a Jacques Chirac supporter. However, the UDF suffered for its lack of cohesion, in contrast to Chirac&#x27;s Rally for the Republic. Its economic policies ranged from favouring left-leaning social justice to favouring laissez-faire liberalism. Such divergences led the laissez-faire advocates, such as Alain Madelin, to form Liberal Democracy in 1997 and split from the UDF in 1998. Similarly, social policies ranged from the social conservatism of the likes of Christine Boutin, famously opposed to civil unions for homosexuals, same-sex marriage, abortion and euthanasia, to more socially progressive policies. Boutin was eventually excluded from the UDF and in 2001 she formed the Forum of Social Republicans.

During the 2007 presidential electoral campaign, François Bayrou presented himself as a centrist and a social-liberal (he even opened the door to gay adoptions), proclaiming that if elected, he would &quot;govern beyond the left-right divide&quot;. He won 18.6% of the vote, but this was not enough for him to reach the second round.

==Factions==
*Bayrouistes, those who wanted the UDF to be independent: Marielle de Sarnez, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, Thierry Cornillet, Gilles Artigues, Bernard Bosson, Anne-Marie Comparini, Charles de Courson, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, Jean Lassalle, Maurice Leroy, Hervé Morin, Rudy Salles, Gérard Vignoble, Nicolas Perruchot, Jean-Luc Préel, François Rochebloine, François Sauvadet
*Society in Movement, those who wanted close ties with the UMP: Gilles de Robien, Olivier Jardé, Jean-Pierre Abelin, Pierre-Christophe Baguet, Jean Dionis du Séjour, Francis Hillmeyer, Michel Hunault, Stéphane Demilly, Yvan Lachaud, André Santini, Francis Vercamer, Claude Leteurtre, Rodolphe Thomas

When Bayrou launched his new Democratic Movement in 2007, only five deputies (Gilles Artigues, Anne-Marie Comparini, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, Jean Lassalle and Gérard Vignoble) out of 29, not counting Bayrou himself, joined. The others, comprising members of Society in Movement and some Bayrouistes, as Hervé Morin and Jean-Louis Bourlanges, joined the presidential majority in support of the new President Nicolas Sarkozy and formed a new &quot;centrist pole&quot; within it, the New Centre.

<text>Oscar &quot;Zeta&quot; Acosta Fierro (; April 8, 1935 – disappeared 1974) was a Mexican American attorney, author and activist in the Chicano Movement. He wrote the semi-autobiographical novels &quot;Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Revolt of the Cockroach People&quot; (1973), and was friends with American author Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson characterized him as a heavyweight Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo, in his 1971 novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. Acosta disappeared in 1974 during a trip in Mexico and is presumed dead.

== Life and career ==
Oscar Acosta was born in El Paso, Texas, to Manuel and Juanita (&quot;née&quot; Fierro) Acosta, from Mexico and El Paso, respectively. He was the third child born, but second to survive childhood. Acosta had an older brother, Roberto, born in 1934. After the family moved to California, the children were raised in the small San Joaquin Valley rural community of Riverbank, near Modesto. Acosta&#x27;s father was drafted during World War II.

After finishing high school, Acosta joined the U.S. Air Force. Following his discharge, he worked his way through Modesto Junior College. Acosta went on to San Francisco State University where he studied creative writing, becoming the first member of his family to get a college education. He attended night classes at San Francisco Law School and passed the state bar exam in 1966. In 1967, Acosta began working locally as an antipoverty attorney for the East Oakland Legal Aid Society.

In 1968, Acosta moved to East Los Angeles and joined the Chicano Movement as an activist attorney, defending Chicano groups and activists. He represented the Chicano 13 of the East L.A. walkouts, members of the Brown Berets, Rodolfo Gonzales, and other residents of the East L.A. barrio. Acosta&#x27;s controversial defenses earned him the ire of the Los Angeles Police Department, who often followed and harassed him. In 1970, he ran for sheriff of Los Angeles County against Peter J. Pitchess, and received more than 100,000 votes. During the campaign, Acosta was jailed for two days for contempt of court. He vowed that if elected, he would do away with the Sheriff&#x27;s Department as it was then constituted. Known for loud ties and a flowered attaché case with a Chicano Power sticker, Acosta lost to Pitchess&#x27; 1.3 million votes but beat Everett Holladay, chief of police of Monterey Park.

In 1972, Acosta published his first novel, &quot;Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo&quot;, about a lawyer fighting for the rights of a marginalized people. In 1973, he published &quot;The Revolt of the Cockroach People&quot;, a fictionalized version of the 1970 Chicano Moratorium as well as an account of the death of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Rubén Salazar.

==Friendship with Hunter S. Thompson==
In the summer of 1967, Acosta met author Hunter S. Thompson. In 1971, Thompson wrote an article about Acosta and the injustice in the barrios of East Los Angeles, as well as the death of Salazar, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, titled &quot;Strange Rumblings in Aztlan&quot;. While working on that article, Thompson received an offer from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to cover an off-road race outside Las Vegas. He invited Acosta to join him, and the two men returned to Las Vegas for a second weekend. Thompson wrote about their adventures in a two-part article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that appeared in 1971. The following year, Random House published &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; as a nonfiction title. 

The legal department of the publisher of &quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; said the book could not be published without clearance by Acosta, as references to him were recognizable. Acosta initially refused the clearance, saying that he was insulted by Thompson&#x27;s alteration of his race—Thompson had described him as a &quot;300-pound Samoan.&quot; He understood, however, that inserting his real name and race would necessitate extensive rewriting and delay publication of the book, so he promised clearance provided that his name and picture would appear on the dustjacket. He later claimed a portion of the film rights, which led to more acrimony. 

Scholar David S. Wills, in &quot;High White Notes: The Rise and Fall of Gonzo Journalism&quot;, argued that it was Acosta who pushed Thompson to pursue the theme of the American Dream and indeed provided much of the plot of the novel through his actions in Las Vegas. He asserts that this is likely the reason why Acosta felt so aggrieved, citing various letters and audio recordings of the two men. Acosta even complained to one of Thompson&#x27;s editors, &quot;Hunter has stolen my soul. He has taken my best lines and has used me.&quot;

Although Thompson and Acosta attempted to work together one more time, their relationship was strained by the dispute over &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, and it never fully recovered. After Acosta&#x27;s death, it took Thompson several years before he wrote an obituary for his friend, &quot;The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat&quot;. In it, Thompson called Acosta &quot;a stupid, vicious quack with no morals at all and the soul of a hammerhead shark.&quot; Ralph Steadman explained that Thompson &quot;berated most of his friends a lot, but somehow it was funny. His way of expressing love for people was to be both angry and insulting.&quot;

== Disappearance ==
In May 1974, Acosta disappeared while traveling in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico. His son, Marco Acosta, believes that he was the last person to talk to his father. Acosta telephoned his son from Mazatlán, telling him that he was &quot;about to board a boat full of white snow.&quot; Marco is later quoted in reference to his father&#x27;s disappearance: &quot;The body was never found, but we surmise that probably, knowing the people he was involved with, he ended up mouthing off, getting into a fight, and getting killed.&quot;

In 1977, Thompson&#x27;s investigation of Acosta&#x27;s disappearance, titled &quot;The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat&quot;, was published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. According to Thompson, Acosta was a powerful attorney and spokesman, but suffered from an addiction to amphetamines and had a predilection for LSD. Thompson wrote that he believed Acosta was either murdered by drug dealers or was the victim of a political assassination. Others have speculated that Acosta overdosed or suffered a nervous breakdown during his trip.

==Motion pictures==
The film &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; (1980) loosely depicts Acosta&#x27;s life and his relationship with Thompson. Its name is derived from Thompson&#x27;s article about Acosta, &quot;The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat&quot;, in reference to Acosta&#x27;s book &quot;Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo&quot;. Actor Peter Boyle portrayed Acosta, whose character is named &quot;Carl Lazlo, Esquire&quot;, and Bill Murray portrayed Thompson.

&quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998) is a film adaptation of Thompson&#x27;s 1972 novel of the same name, a fictionalized account of Thompson and Acosta&#x27;s trip to Las Vegas in 1971. Benicio del Toro portrays Acosta, referred to in the film and novel as &quot;Dr. Gonzo&quot;, while Johnny Depp portrays Thompson (under the alias of Raoul Duke).

&quot;The Rise and Fall of the Brown Buffalo&quot; (2017) is a documentary of the life and career of Acosta, with dramatic reenactments. The documentary was directed by Phillip Rodriguez and produced by Benicio del Toro.

==Quotes==
There are several works that quote or paraphrase Zeta Acosta&#x27;s ideas in a humorous way, always conveyed as &quot;legal advice&quot;.
===As Dr. Gonzo===
In Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s 1971 travel journal &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, the character of Oscar Zeta Acosta is portrayed as &quot;Dr. Gonzo.&quot; Known for his chaotic attitude, Dr. Gonzo offers absurd advice, some of which has become iconic:

* “As your attorney, I advise you to take a hit out of the little brown bottle in my shaving kit.”
* “As your attorney, I advise you to rent a very fast car with no top. And you’ll need the cocaine.”

===As The Brown Buffalo===
In his own 1972 autobiography &quot;The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo&quot;, Acosta portrays himself as &quot;The Brown Buffalo.&quot; His views on the law in this work reflect his rejection of the traditional legal system, seeing it as a tool for control rather than justice:

* “I am not a lawyer, I am a warlord.”
* “The law is the last refuge of the weak, the scared, and the guilty.”
* “the law is everything. To me, it is just another tool.”
* “I don’t need the law. I’ve got my own sense of justice!”
* “The law is just a club they use to beat people with. You just have to be the one holding it.”
* “I have no faith in the law. I only believe in the power of the people to make their own way.”
===As Zeta===
In his 1973 account of the Chicano movement, &quot;The Revolt of the Cockroach People&quot;, Acosta uses the alias &quot;Zeta&quot; to chronicle his experiences with the movement and his role as a lawyer. Zeta’s quotes in this work continue to show his anti-establishment and cynical take on what he saw as a corrupt legal system:

* “A lawyer who can’t take a joke is a lawyer who can’t take a punch.”
* “When I became a lawyer, I found that it wasn’t about justice. It was about who had the most money to pay for it.”

<text>Critical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of identity of the International Style, but also rejects the whimsical individualism and ornamentation of Postmodern architecture. The stylings of critical regionalism seek to provide an architecture rooted in the modern tradition, but tied to geographical and cultural context. Critical regionalism is not simply regionalism in the sense of vernacular architecture. It is a progressive approach to design that seeks to mediate between the global and the local languages of architecture.

The phrase &quot;critical regionalism&quot; was first presented in 1981, in ‘The Grid and the Pathway,’ an essay published in &quot;Architecture in Greece,&quot; by the architectural theorists Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre and, with a slightly different meaning, by the historian-theorist Kenneth Frampton. Sri Lankan Architect Minnette De Silva was one of the pioneers in practicing this architecture style in the 1950s and termed it &#x27;Regional Modernism&#x27;.

Critical Regionalists thus hold that both modern and post-modern architecture are &quot;deeply problematic&quot;.

== Kenneth Frampton ==
In &quot;Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance&quot;, Frampton recalls Paul Ricoeur&#x27;s &quot;how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization&quot;. According to Frampton&#x27;s proposal, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture, critically, for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time value should be placed on the geographical context of the building. Emphasis, Frampton says, should be on topography, climate, light; on tectonic form rather than on scenography (i.e. painting theatrical scenery) and should be on the sense of touch rather than visual sense. Frampton draws on phenomenology for his argument. 

Two examples Frampton briefly discusses are Jørn Utzon and Alvar Aalto. In Frampton&#x27;s view, Utzon&#x27;s Bagsværd Church (1973–6), near Copenhagen is a self-conscious synthesis between universal civilization and world culture. This is revealed by the rational, modular, neutral and economic, partly prefabricated concrete outer shell (i.e. universal civilization) versus the specially-designed, &#x27;uneconomic&#x27;, organic, reinforced concrete shell of the interior, signifying with its manipulation of light sacred space and &#x27;multiple cross-cultural references&#x27;, which Frampton sees no precedent for in Western culture, but rather in the Chinese pagoda roof (i.e. world culture). In the case of Aalto, Frampton discusses the red brick Säynätsalo Town Hall (1952), where, he argues, there is a resistance to universal technology and vision, affected by using the tactile qualities of the building&#x27;s materials. He notes, for instance, feeling the contrast between the friction of the brick surface of the stairs and the springy wooden floor of the council chamber.

In addition to his own writings on the topic, Frampton has furthered the intellectual reach of these ideas through contributions, in the form of introductions, prefaces and forewords, written for publications on architects and architectural practices that conform with the ethics of critical regionalism.

== William J. R. Curtis and Suha Ozkan ==
There have been two different perceptions of Regionalism in architecture. One of which is of Western writers, like Curtis, whose definitions are not encompassing enough to analyse architectural styles especially in the last two centuries in the Islamic countries, like Iran. However, Ozkan&#x27;s definition of Regionalism is more objective.

== Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre ==
According to Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre, critical regionalism need not directly draw from the context; rather elements can be stripped of context but used in unfamiliar ways. Here the aim is to make evident a disruption and loss of place, that is already a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, through reflection and self-evaluation.

== Critical regionalist architects ==

In addition to Aalto and Utzon, the following architects have used Critical Regionalism (in the Frampton sense) in their work: Álvaro Siza Vieira, Studio Granda, Mario Botta, Eduardo Souto de Moura, Mahesh Naik, Sahil Ahmed, Mazharul Islam, B. V. Doshi, Max Strang, Charles Correa, Christopher Benninger, Jorge Ferreira Chaves, Rafael Moneo, Geoffrey Bawa, Raj Rewal, Dharmesh Vadavala, Ashok &quot;Bihari&quot; Lall Neelkanth Chhaya (Kaka), P.K.Das, Soumitro Ghosh, Nisha Mathew Ghosh, Ngô Viết Thụ, Tadao Ando, Mack Scogin / Merrill Elam, Glenn Murcutt, Johnsen Schmaling Architects, Ken Yeang, Philippe Madec, William S.W. Lim, Tay Kheng Soon, WOHA Architects (Singapore), Juhani Pallasmaa, Wang Shu, Juha Leiviskä, Peter Zumthor, Carlo Scarpa, Miller | Hull, Tan Hock Beng. Peter Stutchbury, Lake Flato, Rick Joy, Tom Kundig, and Sverre Fehn. Suzana &amp; Dimitris Antonakakis are the two Greek architects for whom the term was first used by Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre.

Critical regionalism has developed into unique sub-styles across the world. Glenn Murcutt&#x27;s simple vernacular architectural style is representative of an Australian variant to critical regionalism. In Singapore, WOHA has developed a unique architectural vocabulary based on an appreciation of the local climate and culture.

== Criticism ==
Although supportive of Critical Regionalism&#x27;s attempt to adapt design to local climate, site conditions, and locally-available materials, considering it an improvement in relation to the International Style of Modernism, architecture theorist Nikos Salingaros criticizes its anti-regional and anti-traditional tendencies derived from Critical Theory. Nikos Salingaros states that &quot;In practice, critical regionalism willfully perpetuates the form languages of Modernism. Our understanding, however, is that regionalism has to protect and re-use traditional form languages. True regionalism has to free itself from any global form language imposed from above, and from any forces of uniformization and conformity.&quot;

== In cultural studies ==
Subsequently, the phrase &quot;critical regionalism&quot; has also been used in cultural studies, literary studies, and political theory, specifically in the work of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In her 2007 work &quot;Who Sings the Nation-State?&quot;, co-authored with Judith Butler, Spivak proposes a deconstructive alternative to nationalism that is predicated on the deconstruction of borders and rigid national identity. Douglas Reichert Powell&#x27;s book &quot;Critical Regionalism: Connecting Politics and Culture in the American Landscape&quot; (2007) traces the trajectory of the term critical regionalism from its original use in architectural theory to its inclusion in literary, cultural, and political studies and proposes a methodology based on the intersection of those fields.

<doc id="323481" wikidata="Q179374" url="?curid=323481" title="Robert Owen">
<text>Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropist, political philosopher and social reformer, and a founder of utopian socialism and the co-operative movement. He strove to improve factory working conditions, promoted experimental socialistic communities, sought a more collective approach to child-rearing, and &#x27;believed in lifelong education, establishing an Institute for the Formation of Character and School for Children that focused less on job skills than on becoming a better person&#x27;. He gained wealth in the early 1800s from a textile mill at New Lanark, Scotland. Having trained as a draper in Stamford, Lincolnshire he worked in London before relocating at age 18 to Manchester and textile manufacturing. In 1824, he moved to America and put most of his fortune in an experimental socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana, as a preliminary for his utopian society. It lasted about two years. Other Owenite communities also failed, and in 1828 Owen returned to London, where he continued to champion the working class, lead in developing co-operatives and the trade union movement, and support child labour legislation and free co-educational schools.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Robert Owen was born in Newtown, a small market town in Montgomeryshire, Wales, on 14 May 1771, to Anne (Williams) and Robert Owen. His father was a saddler, ironmonger and local postmaster; his mother was the daughter of a Newtown farming family. Young Robert was the sixth of the family&#x27;s seven children, two of whom died at a young age. His surviving siblings were William, Anne, John and Richard.

Owen received little formal education, but he was an avid reader. He left school at the age of ten to be an apprentice draper in Stamford, Lincolnshire, for four years. He also worked in London drapery shops in his teenage years. At about the age of 18, Owen moved to Manchester, where he spent the next twelve years of his life, employed initially at Satterfield&#x27;s Drapery in Saint Ann&#x27;s Square.
On a visit to Scotland, Owen met and fell in love with Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale, daughter of David Dale, a Glasgow philanthropist and the proprietor of the large New Lanark Mills. After their marriage on 30 September 1799, the Owens set up a home in New Lanark, but later moved to Braxfield House in Lanark.

Robert and Caroline Owen had eight children, the first of whom died in infancy. Their seven survivors were four sons and three daughters: Robert Dale (1801–1877), William (1802–1842), Ann (or Anne) Caroline (1805–1831), Jane Dale (1805–1861), David Dale (1807–1860), Richard Dale (1809–1890) and Mary (1810–1832). Owen&#x27;s four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale and Richard, and his daughter Jane Dale, followed their father to the United States, becoming US citizens and permanent residents in New Harmony, Indiana. Owen&#x27;s wife Caroline and two of their daughters, Anne Caroline and Mary, remained in Britain, where they died in the 1830s.

===Textile mills===
While in Manchester, Owen borrowed £100 from his brother William, to enter into a partnership to make spinning mules, a new invention for spinning cotton threads, but exchanged his business shares within a few months for six spinning mules that he worked in rented factory space. In 1792, when Owen was about 21 years old, mill-owner Peter Drinkwater made him manager of the Piccadilly Mill at Manchester. However, after two years with Drinkwater, Owen voluntarily gave up his contract of partnership and left the company, and went into partnership with other entrepreneurs to establish and later manage the Chorlton Twist Mills in Chorlton-on-Medlock.

By the early 1790s, Owen&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and management skills and progressive moral views were emerging. In 1793, he was elected as a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, where the ideas of the Enlightenment were discussed. He also became a committee member of the Manchester Board of Health, instigated principally by Thomas Percival to press for improvements in the health and working conditions of factory workers.

In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became its manager in January 1800. Encouraged by his management success in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. It had been established in 1785 by David Dale and Richard Arkwright. Its water power provided by the falls of the River Clyde turned its cotton-spinning operation into one of Britain&#x27;s largest. About 2,000 individuals were involved, 500 of them children brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dale, known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark residents was unsatisfactory, despite efforts by Dale and his son-in-law Owen to improve their workers&#x27; lives.

Many of the workers were from the lowest social levels: theft, drunkenness and other vices were common and education and sanitation neglected. Most families lived in one room. More respectable people rejected the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.
Until a series of Truck Acts (1831–1887) required employers to pay their employees in common currency, many operated a truck system, paying workers wholly or in part with tokens that had no monetary value outside the mill owner&#x27;s &quot;truck shop&quot;, which charged high prices for shoddy goods. Unlike others, Owen&#x27;s truck store offered goods at prices only slightly above their wholesale cost, passing on the savings from bulk purchases to his customers and placing alcohol sales under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for Britain&#x27;s co-operative shops, some of which continue trading in altered forms to this day.

===American communal living experiments===

To test the viability of his ideas for self-sufficient working communities, Owen began experimenting with communal living in the United States in 1825. Among the most famous efforts was the one set up at New Harmony, Indiana. Of the 130 identifiable communitarian experiments in the United States before the American Civil War, at least 16 were Owenite or Owenite-influenced. New Harmony was Owen&#x27;s earliest and most ambitious of these.

Owen and his son William sailed to the United States in October 1824 to establish an experimental community in Indiana. In January 1825 Owen used a portion of his funds to purchase an existing town of 180 buildings and several thousand acres of land along the Wabash River in Indiana. George Rapp&#x27;s Harmony Society, the religious group that owned the property and that had founded the communal village of Harmony (or Harmonie) on the site in 1814, decided in 1824 to relocate to Pennsylvania. Owen renamed it New Harmony and made the village his preliminary model for a Utopian community.

Owen sought support for his socialist vision among American thinkers, reformers, intellectuals and public statesmen. On 25 February and 7 March 1825, Owen gave addresses to the House of Representatives in Congress and to others in the US government, outlining his vision for the Utopian community at New Harmony, and his socialist beliefs. The audience for his ideas included three former U.S. presidents – John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison – the outgoing US President James Monroe, and the President-elect, John Quincy Adams. His meetings were perhaps the first discussions of socialism in the Americas; they were certainly a big step towards discussion of it in the United States. Owenism, among the first socialist ideologies active in the United States, can be seen as an instigator of the later socialist movement.

Owen convinced William Maclure, a wealthy Scottish scientist and philanthropist living in Philadelphia to join him at New Harmony and become his financial partner. Maclure&#x27;s involvement went on to attract scientists, educators and artists such as Thomas Say, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, and Madame Marie Duclos Fretageot. These helped to turn the New Harmony community into a centre for educational reform, scientific research and artistic expression.

Although Owen sought to build a &quot;Village of Unity and Mutual Cooperation&quot; south of the town, his grand plan was never fully realised and he returned to Britain to continue his work. During his long absences from New Harmony, Owen left the experiment under the day-to-day management of his sons, Robert Dale Owen and William Owen, and his business partner, Maclure. However, New Harmony proved to be an economic failure, lasting about two years, although it had attracted over a thousand residents by the end of its first year. The socialistic society was dissolved in 1827, but many of its scientists, educators, artists and other inhabitants, including Owen&#x27;s four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale Owen, and his daughter Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, remained at New Harmony after the experiment ended.

Other experiments in the United States included communal settlements at Blue Spring, near Bloomington, Indiana, at Yellow Springs, Ohio, and at Forestville Commonwealth at Earlton, New York, as well as other projects in New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Nearly all of these had ended before New Harmony was dissolved in April 1827.

Owen&#x27;s Utopian communities attracted a mix of people, many with the highest aims. They included vagrants, adventurers and other reform-minded enthusiasts. In the words of Owen&#x27;s son David Dale Owen, they attracted &quot;a heterogeneous collection of Radicals&quot;, &quot;enthusiastic devotees to principle&quot;, and &quot;honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists&quot;, with &quot;a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in&quot;.

Josiah Warren, a participant at New Harmony, asserted that it was doomed to failure for lack of individual sovereignty and personal property. In describing the community, Warren explained: &quot;We had a world in miniature – we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result ... It appeared that it was nature&#x27;s inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ... our &#x27;united interests&#x27; were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation&quot;. Warren&#x27;s observations on the reasons for the community&#x27;s failure led to the development of American individualist anarchism, of which he was its original theorist. Some historians have traced the demise of New Harmony to serial disagreements among its members.

Social experiments also began in Scotland in 1825, when Abram Combe, an Owenite, attempted a utopian experiment at Orbiston, near Glasgow, but this failed after about two years. In the 1830s, additional experiments in socialistic co-operatives were made in Ireland and Britain, the most important being at Ralahine, established in 1831 in County Clare, Ireland, and at Tytherley, begun in 1839 in Hampshire, England. The former proved a remarkable success for three-and-a-half years until the proprietor, having ruined himself by gambling, had to sell his interest. Tytherley, known as Harmony Hall or Queenwood College, was designed by the architect Joseph Hansom. This also failed. Another social experiment, Manea Colony in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, launched in the late 1830s by William Hodson, likewise an Owenite, but it failed in a couple of years and Hodson emigrated to the United States. The Manea Colony site has been excavated by the Cambridge Archaeology Unit (CAU) based at the University of Cambridge.

===Return to Great Britain===

Although Owen made further brief visits to the United States, London became his permanent home and the centre of his work in 1828. After extended friction with William Allen and some other business partners, Owen relinquished all connections with New Lanark. He is often quoted in a comment by Allen at the time, &quot;All the world is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer&quot;. Having invested most of his fortune in the failed New Harmony communal experiment, Owen was no longer a wealthy capitalist. However, he remained the head of a vigorous propaganda effort to promote industrial equality, free education for children and adequate living conditions in factory towns, while delivering lectures in Europe and publishing a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas.

In 1832 Owen opened the National Equitable Labour Exchange system, a time-based currency in which the exchange of goods was effected using labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen. The London exchange continued until 1833, with a Birmingham branch operating for just a few months until July 1833. Owen also became involved in trade unionism, briefly leading the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU) before its collapse in 1834.

Socialism first became current in British terminology in discussions of the Association of all Classes of all Nations, which Owen formed in 1835 and served as its initial leader. Owen&#x27;s secular views also gained enough influence among the working classes to cause the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; to comment in 1839 that his principles were the creed of many of them. However, by 1846, the only lasting result of Owen&#x27;s agitation for social change, carried on through public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and occasional treatises, remained the Co-operative movement, and for a time even that seemed to have collapsed.

As Owen grew older and more radical in his views, his influence began to decline. Owen published his memoirs, &quot;The Life of Robert Owen&quot;, in 1857, a year before his death.
Although he had spent most of his life in England and Scotland, Owen returned to his native town of Newtown at the end of his life. He died there on 17 November 1858 and was buried there on 21 November. He died penniless apart from an annual income drawn from a trust established by his sons in 1844.

==Philosophy and influence==
Owen tested his social and economic ideas at New Lanark, where he won his workers&#x27; confidence and continued to have success through improved efficiency at the mill. The community also earned an international reputation. Social reformers, statesmen and royalty, including the future Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, visited New Lanark to study its methods. The opinions of many such visitors were favourable.

Some of Owen&#x27;s schemes displeased his partners, forcing him to arrange for other investors to buy his share of the business in 1813, for the equivalent of US$800,000. The new investors, who included Jeremy Bentham and the well-known Quaker William Allen, were content to accept a £5,000 return on their capital. The ownership change also provided Owen with a chance to broaden his philanthropy, advocating improvements in workers&#x27; rights and child labour laws, and free education for children.

Owen felt that human character is formed by conditions over which individuals have no control. Thus individuals could not be praised or blamed for their behaviour or situation in life. This principle led Owen to conclude that the correct formation of people&#x27;s characters called for placing them under proper environmental influences – physical, moral and social – from their earliest years. These notions of inherent irresponsibility in humans and the effect of early influences on an individual&#x27;s character formed the basis of Owen&#x27;s system of education and social reform.

Relying on his observations, experiences and thoughts, Owen saw his view of human nature as original and &quot;the most basic and necessary constituent in an evolving science of society&quot;. His philosophy was influenced by Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s views on natural law, and his views resembled those of Plato, Denis Diderot, Claude Adrien Helvétius, William Godwin, John Locke, James Mill, and Jeremy Bentham, among others. Owen did not have the direct influence of Enlightenment philosophers.

Owen hoped for a better and more harmonious environment that promoted mutual respect, love and moral values. He believed everyone would have a good education and better living condition to live righteously. He valued social and educational reforms for the middle class and rejected the capitalist power which elevated the powerful figures at the expense of others. Regardless of his adversaries&#x27; attacks, he remained persuasive of his goals. Owen funded kids&#x27; schools and advocated for free education, equal rights and freedom. He participated in legislation to improve labourers&#x27; wages and working conditions. 

Owen believed compassion, kindness and solidarity corrected bad habits, encouraged self-discipline and enhanced a person&#x27;s attitude. Force oppressed people and affected their mental health. In his view, unless people were educated in a proper environment, obtained equal opportunities for jobs and maintained social norms, differences between labour classes, conflicts, and inequalities would persist just as in the British colonies. Without making any changes in the national institutions, he believed that even reorganizing the working classes would bring great benefits. So he opposed the views of radicals seeking to change in the public mentality by expanding voting rights.

===Education===
Owen&#x27;s work at New Lanark continued to have significance in Britain and continental Europe. He was a &quot;pioneer in factory reform, the father of distributive co-operation, and the founder of nursery schools&quot;. His schemes for educating his workers included opening an Institute for the Formation of Character at New Lanark in 1818. This and other programmes at New Lanark provided free education from infancy to adulthood. In addition, he zealously supported factory legislation that culminated in the Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819. Owen also had interviews and communications with leading members of the British government, including its premier, Robert Banks Jenkinson, Lord Liverpool. He also met many of the rulers and leading statesmen of Europe.

Owen&#x27;s biggest success was in support of youth education and early child care. As a pioneer in Britain, notably Scotland, Owen provided an alternative to the &quot;normal authoritarian approach to child education&quot;. Supporters of the methods argued that the manners of children brought up under his system were more graceful, genial and unconstrained; health, plenty and contentment prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown and illegitimacy extremely rare. Owen&#x27;s relations with his workers remained excellent and operations at the mill proceeded in a smooth, regular and commercially successful way.

Perhaps one of Robert Owen&#x27;s most memorable ideas was his silent monitor method. Owen was opposed to common corporal punishment; therefore, to have some form of discipline he developed the &quot;silent monitor&quot;. In his mills, he would hang a four-sided block each displaying a different colour representing the behaviour of the employee. The colour for poor performance was black and he believed it aligned with the Scottish term &#x27;black-affronted&#x27; meaning to be embarrassed, while the opposite is white to symbolize meritorious conduct. His strategy was successful as employees at the time cared about maintaining a good relationship with Owen to leave a good impression on him since he took a different approach to employee regulation. This idea supports his overall thought that human nature is moulded for better or worse by the environment. Owen had a significant impact on British socialism as well as on unionism which helped him set an example for others.

===Labor===
Owen adopted new principles to raise the standard of goods his workers produced. A cube with faces painted in different colours was installed above each machinist&#x27;s workplace. The colour of the face showed to all who saw it the quality and quantity of goods the worker completed. The intention was to encourage workers to do their best. Although it was no great incentive in itself, conditions at New Lanark for workers and their families were idyllic for the time.

Owen raised the demand for an eight-hour day in 1810 and set about instituting the policy at New Lanark. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of an eight-hour working day with the slogan &quot;eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest&quot;.

===Socialism===
In 1813 Owen authored and published &quot;A New View of Society, or Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character&quot;, the first of four essays he wrote to explain the principles behind his philosophy of socialistic reform. In this he writes: 

Owen had originally been a follower of the classical liberal, utilitarian Jeremy Bentham, who believed that free markets, in particular the right of workers to move and choose their employers, would release workers from the excessive power of capitalists. However, Owen developed his own, pro-socialist outlook. In addition, Owen as a deist, criticised organised religion, including the Church of England, and developed a belief system of his own.
Owen embraced socialism in 1817, a turning point in his life, in which he pursued a &quot;New View of Society&quot;. He outlined his position in a report to the committee of the House of Commons on the country&#x27;s Poor Laws. As misery and trade stagnation after the Napoleonic Wars drew national attention, the government called on Owen for advice on how to alleviate the industrial concerns. Although he ascribed the immediate misery to the wars, he saw it as the underlying cause of competition of human labour with machinery and recommended setting up self-sufficient communities. 

Owen appealed to the self-interest of capitalists, pointing out that just as machines need proper care and treatment to guarantee they work smoothly and efficiently, so do humans.

Owen proposed that communities of some 1,200 people should settle on land from , all living in one building with a public kitchen and dining halls. (The proposed size may have been influenced by the size of the village of New Lanark.) Owen also proposed that each family have its private apartment and the responsibility for the care of its children up to the age of three. Thereafter children would be raised by the community, but their parents would have access to them at mealtimes and on other occasions. Owen further suggested that such communities be established by individuals, parishes, counties, or other governmental units. In each case, there would be effective supervision by qualified persons. Work and enjoyment of its results should be experienced communally. Owen believed his idea would be the best way to reorganise society in general, and called his vision the &quot;New Moral World&quot;.

Owen&#x27;s utopian model changed little in his lifetime. His developed model envisaged an association of 500–3,000 people as the optimum for a working community. While mainly agricultural, it would possess the best machinery, offer varied employment, and as far as possible be self-contained. Owen went on to explain that as such communities proliferated, &quot;unions of them federatively united shall be formed in the circle of tens, hundreds and thousands&quot;, linked by a common interest.

Owen grew to be known as a utopian socialist and his works are considered to reflect this attitude. Although he could be considered a member of the bourgeoisie his relationship with this class was often complicated. He fought to pass legislation that benefitted workers. He was an advocate for the Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819. He supported socialist ideas so his views did not have an immediate impact in Britain or the United States.

===Spiritualism===

In 1817, Owen publicly claimed that all religions were false. In 1854, aged 83, Owen converted to spiritualism after a series of sittings with Maria B. Hayden, an American medium credited with introducing spiritualism to England. He made a public profession of his new faith in his publication &quot;The Rational Quarterly Review&quot; and in a pamphlet titled &quot;The Future of the Human Race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women&quot;.

Owen claimed to have had medium contact with the spirits of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and others. He explained that the purpose of these was to change &quot;the present, false, disunited and miserable state of human existence, for a true, united and happy state... to prepare the world for universal peace, and to infuse into all the spirit of charity, forbearance and love.&quot;

Spiritualists claimed after Owen&#x27;s death that his spirit had dictated to the medium Emma Hardinge Britten in 1871 the &quot;Seven Principles of Spiritualism&quot;, used by their National Union as &quot;the basis of its religious philosophy&quot;.

==Legacy==
Owen was a reformer, philanthropist, community builder, and spiritualist who spent his life seeking to improve the lives of others. An advocate of the working class, he improved working conditions for factory workers, which he demonstrated at New Lanark, Scotland, became a leader in trade unionism, promoted social equality through his experimental Utopian communities, and supported the passage of child labour laws and free education for children. In these reforms he was ahead of his time. He envisioned a communal society that others could consider and apply as they wished. In &quot;Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race&quot; (1849), he went on to say that character is formed by a combination of Nature or God and the circumstances of the individual&#x27;s experience. Citing beneficial results at New Lanark, Scotland, during 30 years of work there, Owen concluded that a person&#x27;s &quot;character is not made &quot;by&quot;, but &quot;for&quot; the individual,&quot; and that nature and society are responsible for each person&#x27;s character and conduct.

Owen&#x27;s agitation for social change, along with the work of the Owenites and his children, helped to bring lasting social reforms in women&#x27;s and workers&#x27; rights, establish free public libraries and museums, child care and public, co-educational schools, and pre-Marxian communism, and develop the Co-operative and trade union movements. New Harmony, Indiana, and New Lanark, Scotland, two towns with which he is closely associated, remain as reminders of his efforts.

Owen&#x27;s legacy of public service continued with his four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale, and his daughter, Jane, who followed him to America to live in New Harmony, Indiana:
*Robert Dale Owen (1801–1877), an able exponent of his father&#x27;s doctrines, managed the New Harmony community after his father returned to Britain in 1825. He wrote articles and co-edited with Frances Wright the &quot;New-Harmony Gazette&quot; in the late 1820s in Indiana and the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot; in the 1830s in New York City. Owen returned to New Harmony in 1833 and became active in Indiana politics. He was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives (1836–1839 and 1851–1853) and U.S. House of Representatives (1843–1847) and was appointed chargé d&#x27;affaires in Naples in 1853–1858. While serving as a member of Congress, he drafted and helped to secure passage of a bill founding the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. He was elected a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850, and argued in support of widows and married women&#x27;s property and divorce rights. He also favoured legislation for Indiana&#x27;s tax-supported public school system. Like his father, he believed in spiritualism, authoring two books on the subject: &quot;Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World&quot; (1859) and &quot;The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next&quot; (1872).
*William Owen (1802–1842) moved to the United States with his father in 1824. His business skill, notably his knowledge of cotton goods manufacturing, allowed him to remain at New Harmony after his father returned to Scotland, and serve as an adviser to the community. He organised New Harmony&#x27;s Thespian Society in 1827 but died of unknown causes at the age of 40.
*Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1805–1861) arrived in the United States in 1833 and settled in New Harmony. She was a musician and educator who set up a school in her home. In 1835 she married Robert Henry Fauntleroy, a civil engineer from Virginia living in New Harmony.
*David Dale Owen (1807–1860) moved to the United States in 1827 and resided at New Harmony for several years. He trained as a geologist and natural scientist and earned a medical degree. He was appointed a United States geologist in 1839. His work included geological surveys in the Midwest, more specifically the states of Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas, as well as Minnesota Territory. His brother Richard succeeded him as state geologist of Indiana.
*Richard Dale Owen (1810–1890) emigrated to the United States in 1827 and joined his siblings at New Harmony. He fought in the Mexican–American War in 1847, taught natural science at Western Military Institute in Tennessee from 1849 to 1859, and earned a medical degree in 1858. During the American Civil War he was a colonel in the Union army and served as a commandant of Camp Morton, a prisoner-of-war camp for Confederate soldiers at Indianapolis, Indiana. After the war, Owen served as Indiana&#x27;s second state geologist. In addition, he was a professor at Indiana University and chaired its natural science department from 1864 to 1879. He helped plan Purdue University and was appointed its first president in 1872–1874, but resigned before its classes began and resumed teaching at Indiana University. He spent his retirement years on research and writing.

===Honours and tributes===

*A simple slate tomb for Owen was installed in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard in Newtown. In 1902 the co-operative movement erected Art Nouveau railings around the tomb as a monument to him.
*In 1956 a bronze statue of Owen by Gilbert Bayes was installed in a small garden dedicated to Owen in Newtown.
*The Welsh people donated a bust of Owen by Welsh sculptor Sir William Goscombe John to the International Labour Office library in Geneva, Switzerland.
*In 1994 the Co-operative Bank installed a copy of the Newtown statue in front of its headquarters on Balloon Street, Manchester.

==Criticism of Owen==
Owen&#x27;s project was considered unachievable because he did not establish a guideline that stipulated the administration of properties and the conditions of memberships. As a result, some critics found his plans unsatisfactory and ineffective because the overpopulation and shortage of supply created antagonism within the community. Owen&#x27;s opponents view him as a dictator, and a blasphemer of Christianity because he rejected sacred beliefs and defied anyone who differed from his views. Owen perceived religion as a source of fear and ignorance. Therefore, people were unable to think rationally if they stayed attached to &quot;fallacious testimonies&quot; of religion. 

Other notable critics of Owen include Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, even though they viewed his work as a precursor to their own. They recognized in Owen the important understanding, developed by Marx in &quot;Capital&quot;, that it is the working class that is responsible for creating the unparalleled wealth in capitalist societies. Similarly, Owen also recognized that under the existing economic system, the working class did not automatically receive the benefits of that newly created wealth. Marx and Engels, differentiated, however, their scientific conception of socialism from Owen&#x27;s societies. They argued that Owen&#x27;s plan, to create a model socialist utopia to coexist with contemporary society and prove its superiority over time, was insufficient to create a new society. In their view, Owen&#x27;s &quot;socialism&quot; was utopian, since to Owen and the other utopian socialists &quot;socialism is the expression of absolute truth, reason and justice, and has only to be discovered to conquer all the world by its power.&quot; Marx and Engels believed that the overthrow of the capitalist system could only occur once the working class was organized into a revolutionary socialist political party of the working class that was completely independent of all capitalist class influence, whereas the utopians sought the assistance and the co-operation of the capitalists to achieve the transition to socialism.

<text>Charles&quot;Kid&quot;McCoy (October 13, 1872 – April 18, 1940), born Norman Selby, was an American boxer and early Hollywood actor. He claimed the vacant world middleweight title when he scored an upset victory over Tommy Ryan by 15th-round knockout.

== Overview ==
Born in Moscow, Rush County, Indiana, McCoy would eventually weigh , stand , and go on to a record 81 wins (55 by KO, with 6 losses, 9 no decision, and 6 disqualifications). McCoy was noted for his &quot;corkscrew punch&quot; – a blow delivered with a twisting of the wrist. According to McCoy, he learned the punch one evening while resting in someone&#x27;s barn after a day of riding the rails. He was of Scottish and English ancestry. He noticed a cat strike at a ball of string and imitated its actions. Whether true or not, McCoy was known as a fast, &quot;scientific&quot; fighter who would cut his opponents with sharp blows. He reportedly would wrap his knuckles in mounds of friction tape, to better cut his opponents faces. He was listed # 1 Light Heavyweight of all time in &quot;Fifty Years At Ringside&quot;, published in 1958. He was also regarded as a formidable puncher, and was included in &quot;Ring Magazine&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

== Boxing career ==
Tommy Ryan was knocked out by Kid McCoy in the 15th round on March 2, 1896. This bout forms part of the lore of the McCoy legend. McCoy served as a sparring partner for Ryan, and absorbed many beatings at the hands of his employer. Ryan was notorious for showing little mercy to his sparring partners.
 As a result, McCoy hated Ryan, and sought revenge. It is alleged that McCoy, who appeared thin, pale and frail, persuaded Ryan that he was seriously ill before their fight. McCoy, who was famed as a trickster, purportedly rubbed flour on his face so as to appear deathly ill. Ryan is said to have fallen for the ruse, failed to train properly and was not in top condition for the bout. Whether true or not, McCoy scored an upset win over Ryan in a fight billed for the American and World 154lbs Middleweight Title.

Another one of McCoy&#x27;s tactics was demonstrated while McCoy was on a tour of Australia and some other Pacific Islands. To supplement his income, he would take on all comers. In one unidentified port, McCoy, who scarcely weighed , agreed to box a huge native reputed to weigh in excess of . McCoy watched him train and noted the man fought in his bare feet. When the fight began, McCoy&#x27;s corner threw handfuls of tacks into the ring, causing the bare-footed challenger to drop his guard and raise up one foot. As soon as he did so, McCoy lowered the boom on his distracted adversary.

Although slight of build, McCoy captured the world middleweight championship by defeating Dan Creedon. McCoy never defended the title, choosing to abandon the crown to enable him to pursue the world heavyweight championship. Despite his handicap in size, McCoy battled the best heavyweights of his era, and defeated Joe Choynski and Peter Maher. He was defeated by Tom Sharkey and Jim Corbett. The Corbett fight was the subject of controversy, as the ending was suspect and Corbett&#x27;s estranged wife claimed the bout was fixed.

== &quot;The real McCoy&quot; ==
It has been incorrectly asserted the expression &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; originally referred to Kid McCoy. One origin involves a local tough who bumped into McCoy and laughed when he was told the fellow he was annoying was Kid McCoy. He then challenged McCoy to fight, and upon reviving from being knocked out allegedly remarked &quot;Oh my God, that was the real McCoy&quot;.
However, it is believed that the first publication of the phrase with this spelling occurred in James S. Bond&#x27;s 1881 dime novel, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the &quot;Union club&quot;: or, Boy life in Canada,&quot; wherein a character utters, &quot;By jingo! yes; so it will be It&#x27;s the &#x27;real McCoy,&#x27; as Jim Hicks says.&quot; Skeptics point out that Kid McCoy was only nine years old when this was published.

== Personal life ==
McCoy was married ten times, performed in theater, and went west to California during the birth of the movie industry in Los Angeles. He appeared in films, including a scene fighting Wallace Reid in the 1922 film, &quot;The World&#x27;s Champion.&quot; McCoy was also friends with several movie stars of the day, including Charles Chaplin and director D. W. Griffith, who directed the 1919 silent film, &quot;Broken Blossoms,&quot; Selby&#x27;s second film as actor.

===Legal Issues===
By the early 1920s McCoy was poor, addicted to alcohol and out of the movie industry. At this time he was involved in a romance with a wealthy married woman, Teresa Mors. Mors&#x27;s divorce from her husband was acrimonious and dragged on until she was killed by a single gunshot to the head on August 12, 1924, in the apartment she shared with McCoy at 2819 Leeward (Unit 212).

The next morning, a reportedly disheveled McCoy robbed and held several people captive at Mrs. Mors&#x27; antique shop, and shot one man in the leg after he tried to escape. He also forced at least six other men to remove their trousers, and took their money. McCoy was apprehended and charged with the murder of Mrs. Mors. His trial took place in downtown Los Angeles. McCoy claimed Mrs. Mors committed suicide, while the prosecution claimed he murdered her for financial gain. The jury was split between first degree murder and acquittal. As a compromise verdict, McCoy was convicted of manslaughter.

McCoy was sent to San Quentin, but was paroled from prison in 1932. Afterwards he worked for Ford Motor Company.

=== Marriages ===
=== Extended family ===
Norman Selby was one of six siblings and third oldest. One of his four sisters, Grace Esther Selby &quot;(maiden;&quot; 1885–1916) was, from 1901 to 1908, married to Charles Thomas Henshall (1862–1928). Norman was an uncle to their daughter, actress Barbara Jo Allen (1906–1974).

== Death and legacy==
McCoy took his own life in Detroit on April 18, 1940. Even his death was enigmatic.
He committed suicide at the Hotel Tuller in Detroit by an overdose of sleeping pills, leaving a note behind. It read, among other things

In an apparent last attempt to drop his professional moniker, the note was pointedly signed as, &quot;Norman Selby.&quot;

British professional wrestler Mark Boothman (the son of wrestler Phil &quot;King Ben&quot; Boothman) adopted the &quot;Kid McCoy&quot; name and won the British Lightweight Championship in 1987, holding it for three years.

<text>Fusu (died August or September 210BC) was the eldest son and heir apparent of Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. 

==Life==
After being deceived by two alchemists while seeking prolonged life, Qin Shi Huang supposedly ordered more than 460 scholars in the capital to be buried alive, though an account given by Wei Hong in the 2nd century added another 700 to the figure. Fusu counselled that, with the country newly unified and enemies still not pacified, such a harsh measure imposed on those who respect Confucius would cause instability. However, he was unable to change his father&#x27;s mind and was instead sent to guard the frontier, where Meng Tian was stationed, in a &quot;de facto&quot; exile.

After the death of Qin Shi Huang, Fusu&#x27;s youngest brother, Huhai, together with high officials Zhao Gao and Li Si, forged his father&#x27;s decree to rename Huhai as the successor and order Fusu to commit suicide. Some aides of Fusu, including Meng Tian, doubted the veracity of the decree, but Fusu either did not believe someone would dare to forge the decree or, with good reason, feared being killed anyway and thus committed suicide.

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Fusu had a son, Ziying, who was enthroned after Zhao Gao forced Huhai to commit suicide in 207 BCE. By that time, Li Si had already been eliminated by Zhao Gao. Ziying soon killed Zhao Gao.

There is no firm consensus on what Ziying&#x27;s relationship to the Qin royal family really is. Some scholars (such as Wang Liqun) pointed out that Fusu&#x27;s son might be too young to plot the demise of Zhao Gao, as two sons of Ziying, also involved in the plot, should have been old enough. Qin Shi Huang only lived to be 49; Fusu might have only lived into his 30s.

He sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with Meng Tian.

<text>James Joseph Yee ( or 余优素福, also known by the Arabic name Yusuf Yee) (born c. 1968) is an American former United States Army chaplain with the rank of captain. He worked as a Muslim chaplain at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and was subjected to an intense investigation by the United States for espionage and other crimes, but all charges were later dropped. Yee later authored a book about his experiences as chaplain, &quot;For God and Country&quot;.

== Early life ==
Yee, a Chinese American, was born in New Jersey and raised in Springfield Township, where he attended Jonathan Dayton High School. Yee graduated from West Point in 1990. He converted to Islam in the early 1990s and studied religion in Syria, after which he obtained a letter of equivalency from Leesburg, Virginia&#x27;s Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences, which enabled him to qualify for certification as a military chaplain.

== Career ==
=== Guantanamo ===
In his appointed role as chaplain, Yee ministered to Muslim detainees held at Guantánamo Bay detention camp and received commendation from his superiors for his work. When returning from duty at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, he was arrested on September 10, 2003, in Jacksonville, Florida, when a U.S. Customs agent found a list of Guantanamo detainees and interrogators among his belongings. He was charged with five offenses: sedition, aiding the enemy, spying, espionage, and failure to obey a general order. These charges were later reduced to mishandling classified information in addition to some minor charges. He was then transferred to a United States Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina. The government did not name the country or entity for whom it suspected Yee was spying.

All court-martial charges against Yee were dropped on March 19, 2004, with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller &quot;citing national security concerns that would arise from the release of the evidence,&quot; and he was released to resume his duties. Yee was then accused of adultery and storing pornography on a government computer; and non-judicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ was imposed. His appeal to General James T. Hill, Commander, United States Southern Command, was granted in April 2004. He left the US military with an honorable discharge in January 2005.

=== After Guantanamo ===

In October 2005 Yee published his book, &quot;For God and Country: Faith and Patriotism Under Fire.&quot;
In it, Yee described an escalating series of problems, including the role he says was played by Adolph McQueen, then the commander of the Joint Detention Group. Yee wrote that he was kept in solitary confinement for seventy-six days, and that he was forced to undergo sensory deprivation. He also wrote that General Geoffrey Miller routinely incited the guards to hate the detainees. He alleges being told of mistreatment of prisoners. Yee argues that most of the detainees had little or no intelligence value about Osama bin Laden or al-Qaida&#x27;s inner circle:

In July 2006, Yee was stopped at the border while returning from a trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, to see Cirque du Soleil. It was Yee&#x27;s first trip outside the U.S. since he was discharged from the army. He was detained at the border for 75 minutes. Yee commented, &quot;Perhaps this is an indication I&#x27;m still of interest to the federal government.&quot;

On October 19, 2007, Syrian television broadcast its interview with Yee, in Arabic, where he discussed Koran desecration on the part of the U.S. military.

In December 2007, Yee made a statement on Australian Guantanamo Bay inmate David Hicks, who he regularly counselled while working at Guantanamo Bay. He said that he did not feel Hicks was a threat to Australia, and that &quot;Any American soldier who has been through basic training has had 50 times more training than this guy.&quot;

Yee was a delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention from Washington&#x27;s 9th congressional district, pledged to support Barack Obama.

Yee has spoken about what he witnessed at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to audiences around the world.

== Personal ==
In 1991, Yee converted from Lutheran Christianity to Islam. Yee underwent religious training in Syria, where he met his wife Huda, a Palestinian. Yee is the father of a daughter, Sarah.

<doc id="323489" wikidata="Q1474569" url="?curid=323489" title="Wooden fish">
<text>A wooden fish, also known as a Chinese temple block, wooden bell, or muyu, is a type of woodblock that originated from China that is used as a percussion instrument by monks and lay people in the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism. They are used in Buddhist ceremonies in China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam and other Asian countries. They may be referred to as a Chinese block, Korean block or, rarely, as a skull. 

Wooden fish often used in rituals usually involving the recitation of sutras, mantras, or other Buddhist texts. In Chan Buddhism, the wooden fish serve to maintain rhythm during chanting. In Pure Land Buddhism, they are used when chanting the name of Amitabha.

Wooden fish come in many sizes and shapes, ranging from , for laity use or sole daily practice, or to for usage in temples. Wooden fish are often (in Chinese temples) placed on the left of the altar, alongside a bell bowl, its metal percussion counterpart. Wooden fish often rest on a small embroidered cushion to prevent unpleasant knocking sounds caused from the fish lying on the surface of a hard table or ground, as well as to avoid damage to the instrument.

== Mythical origins ==

There are many tales associated with its invention. One Buddhist legend says that a monk went to India to acquire sutras but on his way he found the way blocked by a wide, flooded river. A fish offered to carry the monk across the river because it wanted to atone for a crime it had committed when it was a human. Its simple request was that on the monk&#x27;s way to obtain sutras, he should ask the Buddha to guide the fish on a method to attain Bodhisattvahood. The monk agreed to the fish&#x27;s request and continued his quest. On his return to China after 17 years with the scriptures, he came upon the flooded river. The same fish asked the monk if he had made the request to Buddha but the monk said he had forgotten. The furious fish splashed him into the river. A passing fisherman saved the drowning monk but all the sutras had been lost in the river. Filled with anger at the fish, the monk made a wooden effigy of a fish head which he beat with a wooden hammer. To his surprise, each time he hit the wooden fish, it made the sound of a Chinese character. He became so happy that he beat the wooden fish regularly. After a few years the monk had got back the lost scriptures he had lost to the flood from the mouth of the wooden fish.

==Usage==

===Traditional versions===
The original type of wooden fish is in the shape of a dragon-fish hybrid creature. Along with a large temple bell and drum, It is found suspended in front of Buddhist monasteries. When proceeding with various duties (such as eating, lectures, or chores), a monk and a supervisor utilize the instrument to call all monastics to go to their tasks. Historically, this was the first wooden fish developed, which gradually evolved into the round wooden fish used by modern Buddhists.

The instrument is carved with fish scales on its top, and a carving of two fish heads embracing a pearl on the handle (to symbolize unity), hence the instrument is called a wooden fish for that reason. In Buddhism the fish, which never sleeps, symbolizes wakefulness. Therefore, it is to remind the chanting monks to concentrate on their sutra where recitation of texts is necessary and the sound symbolizes wakeful attention. It can also symbolize wealth and abundance. At funerals, the processions walk in a slow and unison rhythm while sounding wooden fishes. Other purposes include prayers for rain. In Confucianism, the wooden fish is struck at specific intervals to signify certain stages of ceremonies at temple. In Buddhism, it is struck during chants of Buddha&#x27;s name.

In Korean Buddhism, wooden fish have seen broader use. Two separate words are used in Korean to distinguish different types of wooden fish. Moktak (hangeul: ; hanja: ) refers to a smaller-sized, hand-held variant, whereas mogeo (hangeul: ; hanja: ) means a full-sized piece that resembles a fish or dragon, with a hollow core. &quot;Moktak&quot;, a small version of &quot;mogeo&quot; (wooden fish), can come with ornaments, or not, and is more oblong in shape. It has a handle for easy carrying during portable uses. &quot;Mogeo&quot; are usually hung from the ceiling and played with two sticks drummed from the hollowed-out bottom.

In Japan, wooden fish are called mokugyo (kanji: ; hiragana: もくぎょ), and some huge specimens found in Buddhist temples weigh more than 300 kg.

The Vietnamese name for the wooden fish is (chữ Nôm: ), and the Manchu name is toksitu ().

===Modern types===
The most common ones in use remain the traditional instruments that are round in shape and often made out of wood. However, other materials are now used as well such as composite plastic. All instruments are hollow with a ridge outside that provide the hollow sound when struck. The hollow tone differs among wooden fish because of their size, material, and the size of its internal hollow. Often the mallet used to strike the fish has a rubber coated tip to provide a muffled, but clear sound when struck. A simplified form is given in the temple block.

<text>Acts of Thomas is an early 3rd-century text, one of the New Testament apocrypha within the Acts of the Apostles subgenre. The complete versions that survive are Syriac and Greek. There are many surviving fragments of the text. Scholars detect from the Greek that its original was written in Syriac, which places the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; in Edessa, likely authored before 240 AD. The surviving Syriac manuscripts, however, have been edited to purge them of the most unorthodox overtly Encratite passages, so that the Greek versions reflect the earlier tradition. The earliest external reference to the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; dates to c.225 in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Exegesis on Genesis&quot;, although this text is now lost and its citation survives via later texts, e.g. Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s Ecclesiastical History (3.1.1–3).

Fragments of four other cycles of romances around the figure of the apostle Thomas survive, but this is the only complete one. It should not be confused with the early &quot;sayings&quot; &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot;. &quot;Like other apocryphal acts combining popular legend and religious propaganda, the work attempts to entertain and instruct. In addition to narratives of Thomas&#x27; adventures, its poetic and liturgical elements provide important evidence for early Syrian Christian traditions,&quot; according to the &quot;Anchor Bible Dictionary&quot;.

&quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; is a series of episodic Acts (Latin ) that occurred during the evangelistic mission of Judas Thomas (&quot;Judas the Twin&quot;) to Northwest India, specifically the Persian Kingdom and the Indo-Parthian Kingdom. It ends with his martyrdom: he dies pierced with spears, having earned the ire of the monarch Misdaeus, thought to be Abdagases I, a viceroy of the Gondophares in Sistan, modern day southern Afghanistan, because of his conversion of Misdaeus&#x27; wives and a relative, Charisius. He was imprisoned while converting Indian followers won through the performing of miracles.

Embedded in the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; at different places according to differing manuscript traditions is a Syriac hymn, &quot;The Hymn of the Pearl,&quot; (or &quot;Hymn of the Soul&quot;), a poem that gained a great deal of popularity in mainstream Christian circles. The &quot;Hymn&quot; is older than the &quot;Acts&quot; into which it has been inserted, and is worth appreciating on its own. The text is interrupted with the poetry of another hymn, the one that begins &quot;Come, thou holy name of the Christ that is above every name&quot; (2.27), a theme that was taken up in Catholic Christianity in the 13th century as the Holy Name. 

Mainstream Christian tradition rejects the Acts of Thomas as pseudepigraphical and apocryphal, and for its part, the Roman Catholic Church declared &quot;Acts&quot; as heretical at the Council of Trent. See also Leucius Charinus.

Thomas is often referred to by his name Judas (his full name is &quot;Thomas Judas Didymus&quot;), since both &quot;Thomas&quot; and &quot;Didymus&quot; just mean &quot;twin&quot;, and several scholars believe that &quot;twin&quot; is just a description, and not intended as a name. The manuscripts end &quot;The acts of Judas Thomas the apostle are completed, which he did in India, fulfilling the commandment of him that sent him. Unto whom be glory, world without end. Amen.&quot;

== Acts of Thomas ==
The &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; connects Thomas the apostle&#x27;s Indian ministry with two kings. According to one of the legends in the &quot;Acts&quot;, Thomas was at first reluctant to accept this mission, but the Lord appeared to him in a night vision and said, “Fear not, Thomas. Go away to India and proclaim the Word, for my grace shall be with you.” But the Apostle still demurred, so the Lord overruled the stubborn disciple by ordering circumstances so compelling that he was forced to accompany an Indian merchant, Abbanes, to his native place in north-west India, where he found himself in the service of the Indo-Parthian king Gondophares. The apostle&#x27;s ministry resulted in many conversions throughout the kingdom, including the king and his brother.

The claim made by the acts of Thomas that he traveled to the land of the Parthians and the border of India is supported by other recordings of the time, from writers such as Ephrem the Syrian, Eusebius and Origen The Acts of Thomas states that this is where he died, impaled by spears after earning the ire of the monarch Misdaeus, thought to be Abdagases I, a viceroy of the Gondophares in Sistan, modern day southern Afghanistan. According to the legend, Thomas was a skilled carpenter and was bidden to build a palace for the king. However, the Apostle decided to teach the king a lesson by devoting the royal grant to acts of charity and thereby laying up treasure for the heavenly abode.

== Content ==
The text is broken by headings: 
* 1 - when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant. It even says that Jesus is the son of Joseph. The apostles cast lots to see who will go where as a missionary. Thomas is assigned India but refuses to go, even after Jesus speaks to him. Jesus then appears in human form and sells Thomas to a merchant as a slave, since Thomas is skilled as a carpenter. Thomas is then asked if Jesus is his master, which he affirms. It is only then that he accepts the mission to India.
* 2 - concerning his coming unto the king Gundaphorus
* 3 - concerning the serpent
* 4 - concerning the colt
* 5 - concerning the devil that took up his abode in the woman
* 6 - of the youth that murdered the woman. A young couple begin to have relationship problems when the young woman proves to be too keen on sex, while the young man promotes being chaste, honouring the teachings of Thomas. So, the young man kills his lover. He comes to take the eucharist with others in the presence of Thomas, but his hand withers, and Thomas realises that the young man has committed a grave sin. Upon being confronted, the young man reveals what he did and his reason for doing so. As such, Thomas forgives him as his motive was good, and he goes to find the woman&#x27;s body. In an inn, Thomas and those with him lay the woman&#x27;s body on a couch and after praying, Thomas has the young man hold his lover&#x27;s hand, whereupon the woman comes back to life.

* 7 - of the Captain
* 8 - of the wild asses
* 9 - of the wife of Charisius
* 10 - wherein Mygdonia receiveth baptism
* 11 - concerning the wife of Misdaeus
* 12 - concerning Ouazanes (Iuzanes) the son of Misdaeus
* 13 - wherein Iuzanes receiveth baptism with the rest
* The Martyrdom of Thomas

== View of Jesus ==
The view of Jesus in the book could be inferred to be docetic. Thomas is not just Jesus&#x27; twin, he is Jesus&#x27; identical twin. Hence, it is possible that Thomas signifies the earthly, human side of Jesus, while Jesus is entirely spiritual in his being. In this way, Jesus directs Thomas&#x27; quest from heaven, while Thomas does the work on earth.

Also in line with Gnostic thinking is the text&#x27;s description of Jesus&#x27; stance on sex. For example, in one scene, Jesus appears to a young woman who has just gotten married in her bridal chamber. He advises against copulation even for reproductive purposes.
