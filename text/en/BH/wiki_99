<doc id="338960" wikidata="Q3255006" url="?curid=338960" title="Glossary of music terminology">
<text>A variety of musical terms is encountered in printed scores, music reviews, and program notes. Most of the terms are Italian, in accordance with the Italian origins of many European musical conventions. Sometimes, the special musical meanings of these phrases differ from the original or current Italian meanings. Most of the other terms are taken from French and German, indicated by &quot;Fr.&quot; and &quot;Ger.&quot;, respectively.

Unless specified, the terms are Italian or English. The list can never be complete: some terms are common, and others are used only occasionally, and new ones are coined from time to time. Some composers prefer terms from their own language rather than the standard terms listed here.

; tessitura : The &#x27;best&#x27; or most comfortable pitch range, generally used to identify the most prominent / common vocal range within a piece of music
; tierce de Picardie (Fr.): See Picardy third
; timbre : The quality of a musical tone that distinguishes one tone from another
; time : In a jazz or rock score, after a rubato or rallentendo section, the term &quot;time&quot; indicates that performers should return to tempo (this is equivalent to the term &quot;a tempo&quot;)
; tosto : Immediately
; tranquillo : Calm, peaceful
; transposition : moving a collection of notes up or down in pitch by a constant interval.
; trattenuto (tratt.): Held back with a sustained tone, similar to ritardando

:# A rapid, measured or unmeasured repetition of the same note. String players perform this tremolo with the bow by rapidly moving the bow while the arm is tense;

; tresillo (Sp.): A duple-pulse rhythmic cell in Cuban and other Latin American music
; trill : A rapid, usually unmeasured alternation between two harmonically adjacent notes (e.g. an interval of a semitone or a whole tone). A similar alternation using a wider interval is called a &quot;tremolo&quot;.

; turn : Multi-note ornament above and below the main note; it may also be inverted. Also called &quot;gruppetto&quot;.
; tutti : All; all together, usually used in an orchestral or choral score when the orchestra or all of the voices come in at the same time, also seen in Baroque-era music where two instruments share the same copy of music, after one instrument has broken off to play a more advanced form: they both play together again at the point marked &quot;tutti&quot;.

; vibrato : Vibrating (i.e. a more or less rapidly repeated slight variation in the &quot;pitch&quot; of a note, used as a means of expression). Often confused with tremolo, which refers either to a similar variation in the &quot;volume&quot; of a note, or to rapid repetition of a single note.

<text>Splash is a 1984 American romantic fantasy comedy film directed by Ron Howard, from a screenplay by Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel, and Bruce Jay Friedman, and a story by Friedman and producer Brian Grazer. The film stars Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, John Candy, and Eugene Levy. Its plot involves a young man who falls in love with a mysterious woman who is secretly a mermaid. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

It is notable for being the first film released by Touchstone Pictures, a film label created by Walt Disney Studios that same year in an effort to release films targeted at adult audiences, with mature content not appropriate for the studio&#x27;s flagship Walt Disney Pictures banner. &quot;Splash&quot; received a PG-rating for some profanity and brief nudity, and was critically and commercially successful, earning over $69 million on an $11 million budget, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1984, and received praise for the acting, humor, and chemistry between Hanks and Hannah.

== Plot ==

In 1964, eight-year-old Allen Bauer and his family are taking a boat tour at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Allen is fascinated by something below the surface and jumps overboard, even though he cannot swim. In the ocean, he encounters a young girl and when they hold hands, he inexplicably finds himself able to breathe underwater. However, Allen is rescued and pulled back to the surface, and the two are separated. Since no one else saw the girl, Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination. After the boat pulls away, the young girl is revealed to be a mermaid.

Twenty years later, Allen is now co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie. Throughout the years, Allen&#x27;s relationships have failed as he subconsciously seeks the connection he feels other couples enjoy. Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Walter Kornbluth on a diving expedition. When his motorboat restarts, Allen falls into the sea and is knocked unconscious; his wallet drops onto the coral below. He later wakes up on a beach, in the presence of a beautiful naked young woman who is unable to talk. After kissing Allen, the woman dives into the sea, where she transforms into a mermaid. While swimming underwater, she is sighted by Kornbluth.

The mermaid finds Allen&#x27;s wallet, and uses a sunken ship&#x27;s charts to locate New York. She comes ashore naked at the Statue of Liberty and is arrested for indecent exposure. Using information from the wallet, the police contact Allen and she is released into his care. The mermaid learns how to speak English from watching television, and is eager to explore the city. Unable to say her real name in human language, she selects &quot;Madison&quot; from a Madison Avenue sign. She tells Allen that she will be in New York for &quot;six fun-filled days, and the moon is full&quot;, unable to return home if she stays any longer. Despite Madison&#x27;s occasionally outlandish behavior, she and Allen fall in love. He proposes to her, but she declines and runs away. After some contemplation, Madison returns to Allen and agrees to marry him, with the added promise of telling him the truth about herself after an upcoming dignitary dinner to welcome the President.

Meanwhile, Kornbluth, realizing that Madison is the mermaid he encountered, pursues the couple, trying to expose her by splashing her with water. His first attempts are unsuccessful, and Kornbluth ends up with multiple injuries. Finally, he infiltrates the dignitary dinner, soaking Madison with a hose and successfully unmasking her identity. Madison is seized by government agents and taken to a secret lab, headed by Kornbluth&#x27;s cold-hearted rival Dr. Ross for examination. As she withers away in captivity, Kornbluth learns that the scientists are planning to dissect her, causing him to regret his actions.

Allen is shocked by Madison&#x27;s secret and rejects her, but when he voices his disillusionment to his brother, Freddie lashes out at him, reminding him how happy he was with her. Realizing that he still loves Madison, Allen confronts the guilt-ridden Kornbluth who, having been rejected by his colleagues despite proving the existence of mermaids, agrees to help rescue her. Kornbluth, accompanied by Allen and Freddie impersonating Swedish scientists, enter the lab and smuggle Madison outside. Freddie stays behind to be arrested in Allen&#x27;s place, while Kornbluth unsuccessfully tries to stop military troops from catching the couple.

Despite being pursued, Allen and Madison make it to New York Harbor. Madison tells Allen that he can survive underwater as long as he is with her, prompting Allen to realize that she was the girl he had met underwater as a child. She warns him that if he comes to live in the sea, he will never be able to return to land. Madison dives into the water as the troops close in on them. When they attempt to arrest Allen, he jumps in after her, but starts to drown. She kisses him, gifting him the ability to swim and breathe underwater. Frogmen try to recapture them, but the couple fight them off and escape. Allen discards his jacket and the couple happily swims toward what appears to be an underwater kingdom.

== Cast ==
Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel both make cameo appearances in the film. Ganz plays Stan, the tour guide, in the scene set at the Statue of Liberty. Mandel plays Rudy, the man in charge of ice skate rentals who tackles Hanks&#x27; character when he tries to run out with his skates still on. Director Ron Howard&#x27;s father, actor Rance Howard, can be seen early in the film as Mr. McCullough, an unhappy customer screaming at Allen about his cherries. Howard&#x27;s brother Clint Howard appears as a wedding guest, identified by Candy&#x27;s character as the bride&#x27;s brother and yelled at by Hanks.

== Production ==
The film was initially set up at United Artists, but Brian Grazer decided to take the film elsewhere and took it to The Ladd Company, but Alan Ladd Jr. eventually passed on it. According to the documentary on the &quot;Splash: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; DVD in 2004, producer Brian Grazer had pitched the film to numerous studios but was turned down repeatedly until Walt Disney Productions, then headed by Ron W. Miller, agreed to produce the film. The key to the proposal&#x27;s success was that Grazer changed the premise description from the idea of a mermaid adjusting to life in New York City to that about a love story about an ordinary man in New York City meeting a mermaid. An issue at the time of production was the competition between &quot;Splash&quot; and another announced (but untitled) mermaid film from Warner Bros. that had lined up Warren Beatty as its star. Director Ron Howard promised the studio that &quot;Splash&quot; would be filmed more quickly and cheaply than the other film, which eventually fell through. Howard turned down directing &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; to direct &quot;Splash&quot;.

Several established actors such as Chevy Chase, Dudley Moore, Bill Murray, and John Travolta were considered for the lead role before the producers decided on the then lesser-known Tom Hanks. Hanks was cast because Ganz and Mandel believed that he would be great as an &quot;every man&quot; character. According to Howard, the studio would not give him a green light. Murray turned down the part as he wanted to move away from comedies and do serious films instead. Steve Guttenberg also auditioned for the role. Michael Keaton was offered the role, but he declined so he could star in &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; instead. Before Daryl Hannah was cast as Madison, the role had been previously turned down by P.J. Soles, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Michelle Pfeiffer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Melanie Griffith, Diane Lane, Kathleen Turner, and Sharon Stone. Lane chose to do &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; instead.

Principal photography, which ran from March 1 to June 30, 1983, took place in Los Angeles, New York City, and Gorda Cay, an isle in the Bahamas since purchased by Disney and renamed Castaway Cay. Donald Peterman served as the film&#x27;s cinematographer, with Jon Fauer serving as camera operator for the film&#x27;s New York scenes.

Hannah&#x27;s mermaid tail was designed and created by Academy Award-winning visual effects artist Robert Short. The tail was fully functional. Hannah swam with the mermaid tail so fast that her safety team could not keep pace with her. According to the DVD documentary, Hannah had been swimming &quot;mermaid&quot; style with her legs bound together since she was a child, due to her fascination with Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; story. However, the exceptionally detailed film tail was difficult to remove. For the sake of efficiency, Hannah at first kept it on while the cast had lunch. In the documentary included on the 20th-anniversary &quot;Splash&quot; DVD, Hanks recalled how the other cast members would drop French fries over the side of the tank to her as though she were a trained sea mammal, because she could not leave the water while her legs were &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
Produced on a $11 million budget, &quot;Splash&quot; grossed $6.2 million on its opening weekend and finished its run with a gross of $69.8 million in the United States and Canada, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 1984.

=== Critical response ===
The film was well received by critics and is considered to be one of the best films of 1984. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A perfectly light, warmly funny romantic comedy that&#x27;s kept afloat by Ron Howard&#x27;s unobtrusive direction and charming performances from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

One of the film&#x27;s few negative reviews came from Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and thought the film&#x27;s biggest failing was casting then-unknown Hanks as the lead rather than the established comedy actor John Candy: &quot;They should have made Candy the lover, and Hanks the brother. Then we&#x27;d be on the side of this big lunk who suddenly has a mermaid drop into his life.&quot; Colin Greenland of &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine stated that &quot;&quot;Splash&quot; is an adult film that has the grace to treat fantasy with sensitivity and a sense of humour.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== Soundtrack releases ==
A soundtrack album of Lee Holdridge&#x27;s music for the film was released on both vinyl LP and cassette in the United Kingdom by Cherry Lane Records Ltd in 1984, with the music re-recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the composer and the love theme song covered by Kira McClelland. Both have been out of print for many years. The catalogue numbers for these releases were PIPLP 710 and ZCPIP 710 respectively. In 2000, the original music was released on a 26-track CD in the United States by Super Tracks Music Group. The back cover states that this product is &quot;For Promotional Use Only&quot; and that it has been &quot;Manufactured for the composer...&quot;. Although this release is very hard to find brand new and may in fact be out of print, it is still obtainable from certain film soundtrack specialist retailers and also occasionally used from certain online stores. This CD has every track that the LP and cassette have but has a considerably longer running length due to the 12 extra tracks. These extra tracks include more of the original music from the film, the theme song (by Lee Holdridge and Will Jennings) sung by Rita Coolidge and alternate versions of some of the tracks which appear on the LP and Cassette. The catalogue number for this release is LH CD – 02.

== Legacy ==
The film&#x27;s title served as inspiration for the name of Disney&#x27;s theme park ride Splash Mountain. While the studio was coming out with the film, the Disney Imagineers were working on the ride, which was originally intended to be called Zip-a-Dee River Run. However, the studio executives requested that the ride be called Splash Mountain in order to promote the film.

Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner&#x27;s book &quot;Freakonomics&quot; (2006) credits the film with popularizing the name Madison for girls, as does Steven Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Stuff of Thought&quot; (2007). In the film, Hannah&#x27;s character takes her name from Madison Avenue (itself named after President James Madison) after walking past a road sign. Hanks&#x27; character comments that &quot;Madison&#x27;s not a name&quot; as, at the time, it was an extremely rare first name for a woman. However, in the years since the film was released in theaters and re-released on VHS and then DVD, the name&#x27;s popularity has skyrocketed.

According to the Social Security Administration, the name Madison was the 216th most popular name in the United States for girls in 1990, the 29th most popular name for girls in 1995, and the third most popular name for girls in 2000. In 2005, the name cracked the top 50 most popular girls&#x27; names in the United Kingdom, and articles in British newspapers credit the film for the popularization. In a 2014 interview, Hannah commented on the irony of the name&#x27;s popularity and subsequent acceptance as a standard first name given its origins as a joke based on Madison being primarily known as a street name at the time:

It&#x27;s funny because no one understands the irony, because the whole point of me choosing that name was because it [was such a] silly name...Obviously everyone knew it as the name of the street. No one really saw it as a first name and that was a joke. And now, of course it&#x27;s not funny at all. It&#x27;s just like, &#x27;Oh, what a beautiful name!&#x27;...It was funny at the time and now it&#x27;s not even ironic.

=== Spin-offs ===
* &quot;Splash, Too&quot; (directed by Greg Antonacci), is a television film released in 1988 starring Todd Waring as Allen Bauer, Amy Yasbeck as Madison, and Donovan Scott as Freddie Bauer. One member of the original cast, Dody Goodman, the Bauers&#x27; office assistant Mrs. Stimler, reprises her role.
* A novelization of the film, written by Ian Marter (under the pen name Ian Don), was published by Target Books in the United Kingdom.

== Remake ==
In June 2016, producer Brian Grazer announced that he was working on a remake of &quot;Splash&quot;, although this version would be told from the point of view of the mermaid, which was more in line with the earlier drafts of the original film. Jillian Bell and Channing Tatum were set to star as a female human and a merman, respectively. Tatum was also set to produce the remake through his production company, Free Association, along with Reid Carolin and Peter Kieran, while Howard and Grazer will also produce from Imagine Entertainment with Anna Culp as the executive producer and Marja-Lewis Ryan writing. , the project was still in development. In February 2023, it was reported that Sarah Rothschild will write the script.

<doc id="338963" wikidata="Q748825" url="?curid=338963" title="Third rail">
<text>A third rail, also known as a live rail, electric rail or conductor rail, is a method of providing electric power to a railway locomotive or train, through a semi-continuous rigid conductor placed alongside or between the rails of a railway track. It is used typically in a mass transit or rapid transit system, which has alignments in its own corridors, fully or almost fully segregated from the outside environment. Third-rail systems are usually supplied from direct current electricity.

Modern tram systems with street-running avoid the risk of electrocution by the exposed electric rail by implementing a segmented ground-level power supply, where each segment is electrified only while covered by a vehicle which is using its power.

The third-rail system of electrification is not related to the third rail used in dual-gauge railways.

The system is generally associated with a low voltage (rarely above 750 V) and is far less used for main lines than overhead line that with an higher voltage permit more distance between the substations. Also, for safety reason, third rail systems are generally fully grade separated. Third rail found its niche in metro systems where bore a smaller tunnel is more important than having fewer substations. However there are some main lines that use third rail, like lines in Southern England, Merseyrail, Long Island Rail Road, Hudson and Harlem lines of Metro North Railroad and Mitre, Sarmiento and Urquiza lines in Greater Buenos Aires.

== Description ==
Third-rail systems are a means of providing electric traction power to trains using an additional rail (called a &quot;conductor rail&quot;) for the purpose. On most systems, the conductor rail is placed on the sleeper ends outside the running rails, but in some systems a central conductor rail is used. The conductor rail is supported on ceramic insulators (known as &quot;pots&quot;), at top contact or insulated brackets, at bottom contact, typically at intervals of around .

The trains have metal contact blocks called collector shoes (also known as contact shoes or pickup shoes) which make contact with the conductor rail. The traction current is returned to the generating station through the running rails. In North America, the conductor rail is usually made of high conductivity steel or steel bolted to aluminium to increase the conductivity. Elsewhere in the world, extruded aluminium conductors with stainless steel contact surface or cap, is the preferred technology due to its lower electrical resistance, longer life, and lighter weight. The running rails are electrically connected using wire bonds or other devices, to minimise resistance in the electric circuit. Contact shoes can be positioned below, above, or beside the third rail, depending on the type of third rail used: these third rails are referred to as bottom-contact, top-contact, or side-contact, respectively.

The conductor rails have to be interrupted at level crossings, crossovers, and substation gaps. Tapered rails are provided at the ends of each section to allow a smooth engagement of the train&#x27;s contact shoes.

The position of contact between the train and the rail varies: some of the earliest systems used top contact, but later developments use side or bottom contact, which enabled the conductor rail to be covered, protecting track workers from accidental contact and protecting the conductor rail from frost, ice, snow and leaf-fall.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Safety ===

Because third-rail systems, which are located close to the ground, present electric shock hazards, high voltages (above 1500 V) are not considered safe. A very high current must therefore be used to transfer adequate power to the train, resulting in high resistive losses, and requiring relatively closely spaced feed points (electrical substations).

The electrified rail threatens electrocution of anyone wandering or falling onto the tracks. The risk of falling can be avoided by using platform screen doors, or the risk can be reduced by placing the conductor rail on the side of the track away from the platform, when allowed by the station layout, or by covering the conductor rail with a coverboard, a plank supported by brackets. However, coverboards often cannot be used because they reduce the structure gauge near the top of rail and thereby also the loading gauge.

There is also a risk of pedestrians walking onto the tracks at level crossings and accidentally touching the third rail, unless grade separation is fully implemented. In the United States, a 1992 Supreme Court of Illinois decision affirmed a $1.5 million verdict against the Chicago Transit Authority for failing to stop an intoxicated person from walking onto the tracks at a level crossing at the Kedzie station in an apparent attempt to urinate.

The end ramps of conductor rails (where they are interrupted, or change sides) present a practical limitation on speed due to the mechanical impact of the shoe, and is considered the upper limit of practical third-rail operation. The world speed record for a third rail train is attained on 11 April 1988 by a British Class 442 EMU.

In the event of a collision with a foreign object, the beveled end ramps of bottom running systems can facilitate the hazard of having the third rail penetrate the interior of a passenger car. This is believed to have contributed to the death of five passengers in the Valhalla train crash of 2015.

Modern systems, such as ground-level power supply (first used in the tramway of Bordeaux in 2003), avoid the safety problem by segmenting the powered rail, with each segment being powered only when fully covered by the vehicle which utilizes its power.

=== Weather effects ===
Third-rail systems using top contact are prone to accumulations of snow, or ice formed from refrozen snow, and this can interrupt operations. Some systems operate dedicated de-icing trains to deposit an oily fluid or antifreeze (such as propylene glycol) on the conductor rail to prevent the frozen build-up. The third rail can also be heated to alleviate the problem of ice.

Unlike overhead line equipment, third-rail systems are not susceptible to strong winds or freezing rain, which can bring down overhead wires and hence disable all trains. Thunderstorms can also disable the power with lightning strikes on systems with overhead wires, disabling trains if there is a power surge or a break in the wires.

=== Gaps ===
 Depending on train and track geometry, gaps in the conductor rail (e.g., at level crossings and junctions) could allow a train to stop in a position where all of its power pickup shoes are in gaps, so that no traction power is available. The train is then said to be &quot;gapped&quot;. Another train must then be brought up behind the stranded train to push it on to the conductor rail, or a jumper cable may be used to supply enough power to the train to get one of its contact shoes back on the live rail. Avoiding this problem requires a minimum length of trains that can be run on a line. Locomotives have either had the backup of an on-board diesel engine system (e.g., British Rail Class 73), or have been connected to shoes on the rolling stock (e.g. Metropolitan Railway).

=== Running rails for power supply ===
The first idea for feeding electricity to a train from an external source was by using both rails on which a train runs, whereby each rail is a conductor for each polarity, and is insulated by the sleepers. This method is used by most scale model trains; however, it does not work as well for large trains as the sleepers are not good insulators. Furthermore, the electric connection requires insulated wheels or insulated axles, but most insulation materials have poor mechanical properties compared with metals used for this purpose, leading to a less stable train vehicle. Nevertheless, it was sometimes used at the beginning of the development of electric trains. The oldest electric railway in the world, Volk&#x27;s Railway in Brighton, England, was originally electrified at 50 volts DC using this system (it is now a three-rail system). Other railway systems that used it were the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway and the Ungerer Tramway.

=== Shoe contact ===
The third rail is usually located outside the two running rails, but on some systems it is mounted between them. The electricity is transmitted to the train by means of a sliding shoe, which is held in contact with the rail. On many systems, an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track; sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side (called &quot;side running&quot;) or bottom (called &quot;bottom running&quot; or &quot;under-running&quot;) of the third rail, allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface. When the shoe slides along the top surface, it is referred to as &quot;top running&quot;. When the shoe slides along the bottom surface, it is less affected by the build-up of snow, ice, or leaves, and reduces the chances of a person being electrocuted by coming in contact with the rail. Examples of systems using under-running third rail include Metro-North in the New York metropolitan area; the SEPTA Market–Frankford Line in Philadelphia; and London&#x27;s Docklands Light Railway.

=== Electrical considerations and alternative technologies ===
Electric traction trains (using electric power generated at a remote power station and transmitted to the trains) are considerably more cost-effective than diesel or steam units, where separate power units must be carried on each train. This advantage is especially marked in urban and rapid transit systems with a high traffic density.

Because of mechanical limitations on the contact to the third rail, trains that use this method of power supply achieve lower speeds than those using overhead electric wires and a pantograph. Nevertheless, they may be preferred inside cities as there is no need for very high speed and they cause less visual pollution.

The third rail is an alternative to overhead lines that transmit power to trains by means of pantographs attached to the trains. Whereas overhead-wire systems can operate at 25 kV or more, using alternating current (AC), the smaller clearance around a live rail imposes a maximum of about 1200 V, with some systems using 1500 V (Line 4, Guangzhou Metro, Line 5, Guangzhou Metro, Line 3, Shenzhen Metro), and direct current (DC) is used. Trains on some lines or networks use both power supply modes (see below).

All third-rail systems throughout the world are energised with DC supplies. Some of the reasons for this are historical. Early traction engines were DC motors, and the then-available rectifying equipment was large, expensive and impractical to install onboard trains. Also, transmission of the relatively high currents required results in higher losses with AC than DC. Substations for a DC system will have to be (typically) about apart, though the actual spacing depends on the carrying capacity, maximum speed, and service frequency of the line.

One method for reducing current losses (and thus increase the spacing of feeder/substations, a major cost in third rail electrification) is to use a composite conductor rail of a hybrid aluminium/steel design. The aluminium is a better conductor of electricity, and a running face of stainless steel gives better wear.

There are several ways of attaching the stainless steel to the aluminium. The oldest is a co-extruded method, where the stainless steel is extruded with the aluminium. This method has suffered, in isolated cases, from de-lamination (where the stainless steel separates from the aluminium); this is said to have been eliminated in the latest co-extruded rails. A second method is an aluminium core, upon which two stainless steel sections are fitted as a cap and linear welded along the centre line of the rail. Because aluminium has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, the aluminium and steel must be positively locked to provide a good current collection interface. A third method rivets aluminium bus strips to the web of the steel rail.

=== Return current mechanisms ===
As with overhead wires, the return current usually flows through one or both running rails, and leakage to ground is not considered serious. Where trains run on rubber tyres, as on parts of the Lyon Metro, Paris Métro, Mexico City Metro, Santiago Metro, Sapporo Municipal Subway, and on all of the Montreal Metro and some automated guideway transit systems (e.g. the Astram Line), a live rail must be provided to feed the current. The return is effected through the rails of the conventional track between these guide bars (&quot;see rubber-tyred metro&quot;).

Another design, with a third rail (current feed, outside the running rails) and fourth rail (current return, midway between the running rails), is used by a few steel-wheel systems; see fourth rail. The London Underground is the largest of these (see railway electrification in Great Britain). The main reason for using the fourth rail to carry the return current is to avoid this current flowing through the original metal tunnel linings which were never intended to carry current, and which would suffer electrolytic corrosion should such currents flow in them.

Another four-rail system is line M1 of the Milan Metro, where current is drawn by a lateral, flat bar with side contact, with return via a central rail with top contact. Along some sections on the northern part of the line an overhead line is also in place, to allow line M2&#x27;s trains (that use pantographs and higher voltage, and have no contact shoes) to access a depot located on line M1. In depots, line M1 trains use pantographs because of safety reasons, with transition made near the depots away from revenue tracks.

=== Aesthetic considerations ===
Third rail electrification is less visually obtrusive than overhead electrification.

== Mixed systems ==

Several systems use a third rail for part of the route, and other motive power such as overhead catenary or diesel power for the remainder. These may exist because of the connection of separately owned railways using the different motive systems, local ordinances, or other historical reasons.

=== United Kingdom ===

Several types of British trains have been able to operate on both overhead and third-rail systems, including British Rail Class 313, 319, 325, 350, 365, 375/6, 377/2, 377/5, 377/7, 378/2, 387, 373, 395, 700 and 717 EMUs, as well as Class 92 locomotives.

Network Rail claims to run the world&#x27;s largest third-rail network.

On the southern region of British Rail, freight yards had overhead wires to avoid the electrocution hazards of a third rail. The locomotives were fitted with a pantograph as well as pick-up shoes.

==== Eurostar/High Speed 1 ====
The Class 373 used for international high-speed rail services operated by Eurostar through the Channel Tunnel runs on overhead wires at 25 kV AC for most of its journey, with sections of 3 kV DC on Belgian lines between the Belgian high-speed section and Brussels Midi station or 1.5 kV DC on the railway lines in the south of France for seasonal services. As originally delivered, the Class 373 units were additionally fitted with 750 V DC collection shoes, designed for the journey in London via the suburban commuter lines to Waterloo. A switch between third-rail and overhead collection was performed while running at speed, initially at Continental Junction near Folkestone, and later on at Fawkham Junction after the opening of the first section of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Between Kensington Olympia railway station and North Pole depot, further switchovers were necessary.

The dual-voltage system did cause some problems. Failure to retract the shoes when entering France caused severe damage to the trackside equipment, causing SNCF to install a pair of concrete blocks at the Calais end of both tunnels to break off the third rail shoes if they had not been retracted. An accident occurred in the UK when a Eurostar driver failed to retract the pantograph before entering the third-rail system, damaging a signal gantry and the pantograph.

On 14 November 2007, Eurostar&#x27;s passenger operations were transferred to St Pancras railway station and maintenance operations to Temple Mills depot, making the 750 V DC third rail collection equipment redundant and the third rail shoes were removed. The trains themselves are no longer fitted with a speedometer capable of measuring the speed in miles per hour (the indication used to automatically change when the collector shoes were deployed).

In 2009, Southeastern began operating domestic services over High Speed 1 trackage from St Pancras using its new Class 395 EMUs. These services operate on the High Speed line as far as or , before transferring to the main lines to serve north and mid Kent. As a consequence, these trains are dual-voltage enabled, as the majority of the routes along which they travel are third-rail electrified.

==== North London Line ====

In London, the North London Line changes from third rail to overhead electrification between Richmond and Stratford at . The entire route originally used third rail, but several technical electrical earthing problems, plus the fact that there are already overhead electric wires on part of the route for freight and Regional Eurostar services, led to the change.

==== West London Line ====

Also in London, the West London Line changes power supply between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Willesden Junction, where it meets the North London Line. South of the changeover point, the WLL is third rail electrified, north of there, it is overhead.

==== Thameslink ====

The cross-city Thameslink service runs on the Southern Region third rail network from Farringdon southwards and on overhead line northwards to Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough. The changeover is made whilst stationary at Farringdon when heading southbound, and at City Thameslink when heading northbound.

==== Northern City ====

On the Moorgate to Hertford and Welwyn suburban service routes, the East Coast Main Line sections are 25 kV AC, with a changeover to third rail made at Drayton Park railway station. A third rail is still used in the tunnel section of the route, because the size of the tunnels leading to Moorgate station was too small to allow for overhead electrification.

==== North Downs Line ====

The North Downs Line is not electrified on those parts of the line where the North Downs service has exclusive use.

The electrified portions of the line are:
:* Redhill to Reigate – Allows Southern Railway services to run to Reigate. This saves having to turn around terminating services at Redhill where due to the station layout, as the reversal would block nearly all the running lines.
:* Shalford Junction to Aldershot South Junction – line shared with South Western Railway electric Portsmouth and Aldershot services.
:* Wokingham to Reading – line shared with South Western Railway electric services from Waterloo.

=== Finland ===

The Helsinki Metro uses a 750 V DC third-rail system. The section from Vuosaari to Vuosaari harbour is not electrified, as its only purpose is to connect to the Finnish rail network, whose gauge differs only by a couple of millimetres from that of the metro. The route has been previously used by diesel shunting locomotives moving new metro trains to the electrified section of the line.

=== France ===
The new tramway in Bordeaux (France) uses a novel system with a third rail in the centre of the track. The third rail is separated into long conducting and long isolation segments. Each conducting segment is attached to an electronic circuit which will make the segment live once it lies fully beneath the tram (activated by a coded signal sent by the train) and switch it off before it becomes exposed again. This system (called &quot;Alimentation par Sol&quot; (APS), meaning &#x27;current supply via ground&#x27;) is used in various locations around the city but especially in the historic centre: elsewhere the trams use the conventional overhead lines (see also ground-level power supply). In summer 2006 it was announced that two new French tram systems would be using APS over part of their networks. These will be Angers and Reims, with both systems expected to open around 2009–2010.

The French Culoz–Modane railway was electrified with 1500 V DC third rail, later converted to overhead wires at the same voltage. Stations had overhead wires from the beginning.

The French branch line which serves Chamonix and the Mont Blanc region (Saint-Gervais-le-Fayet to Vallorcine) is third rail (top contact) and metre gauge. It continues in Switzerland, partly with the same third-rail system, partly with an overhead line.

The long Train Jaune line in the Pyrenees also features a third rail.

Many suburban lines that ran out of the Paris Saint Lazare station used third-rail (bottom contact) feed.

=== Netherlands ===

To mitigate investment costs, the Rotterdam Metro, basically a third-rail-powered system, has been given some outlying branches built on surface tracks as light rail (called in Dutch), with numerous level crossings protected with barriers and traffic lights. These branches have overhead wires. The RandstadRail project also requires Rotterdam Metro trains to run under wires along the former mainline railways to The Hague and Hook of Holland.

Similarly, in Amsterdam one route went on Metro tracks and passed to surface alignment in the suburbs, where it shared tracks with standard trams. In Amsterdam, the lightrail uses a third rail and switches to overhead wires when it moves onto the traditional tramway shared with trams in Amsterdam. Line 51 to Amstelveen ran metro service between Amsterdam Centraal and Station Zuid. At Amsterdam Zuid it switched from third rail to pantograph and catenary wires. From there to Amstelveen Centrum it shared its tracks with tram line 5. The light rail vehicles on this line were capable of using both 600 V DC and 750 V DC. As of March 2019 this metro line has been decommissioned, partly because of issues regarding switching between third rail and overhead wires. Its line number 51 has been assigned to a new metro line running partly the same route from Amsterdam Central railway station to Station Zuid and then following the same route as metro line 50 to Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station.

=== United States ===

In New York City, the New Haven Line of Metro–North Railroad operates electric trains out of Grand Central Terminal that use third rail on the former New York Central Railroad but switch to overhead lines in Pelham to operate out onto the former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The switch is made &quot;on the fly&quot; (at speed), and controlled from the engineer&#x27;s position.

The main two stations in New York City – Grand Central and Pennsylvania Station – do not permit diesel locomotives to operate in their tunnels due to the health hazard from the exhaust. As such, diesel service on Metro-North, Long Island Rail Road, and Amtrak use dual-mode/electro-diesel locomotives (the P32AC-DM and the DM30AC) that are able to make use of the third-rail power in the stations and approaches. When under third rail operation, these locomotives are less powerful, so on open-air (non-tunnel) trackage the engines typically run in diesel mode, even where third-rail power is available. New Jersey Transit also makes use of ALP-45DP dual mode locomotives for operation into Penn Station alongside their normal electric fleet. However, their dual mode locomotives make use of the overhead power supply instead, as it is available elsewhere on much of their network.

In New York City (on most of the island of Manhattan) and in Washington, D.C., local ordinances once required electrified street railways to draw current from a third rail and return the current to a fourth rail, both installed in a continuous vault underneath the street and accessed by means of a collector that passed through a slot between the running rails. When streetcars on such systems entered territory where overhead lines were allowed, they stopped over a pit where a man detached the collector (&quot;plow&quot;) and the motorman placed a trolley pole on the overhead. In the US, all these conduit-feed powered systems have been discontinued, and either replaced or abandoned altogether.

Some sections of the former London tram system also used the conduit current collection system, also with some tramcars that could collect power from both overhead and under-road sources.

The Blue Line of Boston&#x27;s MBTA uses third-rail electrification from the start of the line downtown to Airport station, where it switches to overhead catenary for the remainder of the line to Wonderland station. The outermost section of the Blue Line runs very close to the Atlantic Ocean, and there were concerns about possible snow and ice buildup on a third rail so near to the water. Overhead catenary is not used in the underground section because of tight clearances in the 1904 tunnel under Boston Harbor. The MBTA Orange Line&#x27;s Hawker Siddeley 01200 series rapid transit cars (essentially a longer version of the Blue Line&#x27;s 0600s) recently had their pantograph mounting points removed during a maintenance program; these mounts would have been used for pantographs which would have been installed had the Orange Line been extended north of its current terminus.

Dual power supply method was also used on some US interurban railways that made use of newer third rail in suburban areas, and existing overhead streetcar (trolley) infrastructure to reach downtown. For example, the Chicago &quot;L&quot; Yellow Line (which uses tracks originally used by the North Shore Line) used overhead wires on the western half of the route, which transitioned into third rail for the eastern half of the route. The entire line was converted to third rail in 2004 in order to reduce maintenance costs and allow better compatibility with rolling stock.

== Simultaneous use with overhead wire ==

A railway can be electrified with an overhead wire and a third rail at the same time. This was the case, for example, on the Hamburg S-Bahn between 1940 and 1955. A modern example is Birkenwerder Railway Station near Berlin, which has third rails on both sides and overhead wires. Most of the Penn Station complex in New York City is also electrified with both systems.

== Non-standard voltages ==
Some high third rail voltages (1000 volts and more) include:
* Hamburg S-Bahn: 1200 V, since 1940
* Manchester–Bury, England: 1200 V (side contact) (Until Metrolink conversion in 1991)
* Culoz–Modane railway, France: 1500 V, 1925–1976
* Guangzhou Metro Lines 4 and 5: 1500 V
* Bay Area Rapid Transit, San Francisco, 1000 V

In Nazi Germany, a railway system with a gauge width was planned. For this &quot;Breitspurbahn&quot; railway system, electrification with a voltage of 100 kV taken from a third rail was considered, in order to avoid damage to overhead wires from oversize rail-mounted anti-aircraft guns. However, such a power system would not have worked as it is not possible to insulate a third rail for such high voltages in close proximity to the rails. The whole project did not progress any further owing to the onset of World War II.

== History ==

Third-rail electrification systems are, apart from on-board batteries, the oldest means of supplying electric power to trains on railways using their own corridors, particularly in cities. Overhead power supply was initially almost exclusively used on tramway-like railways, though it also appeared slowly on mainline systems.

An experimental electric train using this method of power supply was developed by the German firm of Siemens &amp; Halske and shown at the Berlin Industrial Exposition of 1879, with its third rail between the running rails. Some early electric railways used the running rails as the current conductor, as with the 1883-opened Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway in Brighton. It was given an additional power rail in 1886, and is still operating. The Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway followed, equipped with an elevated outside third rail in 1883, later converted to overhead wire. The first railway to use the central third rail was the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway in Ireland, opened in 1885 but now, like the Giant&#x27;s Causeway line, closed.

Also in the 1880s, third-rail systems began to be used in public urban transport. Trams were first to benefit from it: they used conductors in conduit below the road surface (see Conduit current collection), usually on selected parts of the networks. This was first tried in Cleveland (1884) and in Denver (1885) and later spread to many big tram networks (e.g. New York; Chicago; Washington, DC; London; Paris, all of which are closed) and Berlin (the third-rail system in the city was abandoned in the early 20th century after heavy snowfall.) The system was tried in the beachside resort of Blackpool, UK, but was soon abandoned as sand and saltwater were found to enter the conduit and cause breakdowns, and there was a problem with voltage drop. Some sections of tramway track still have the slot rails visible.

A third rail supplied power to the world&#x27;s first electric underground railway, the City &amp; South London Railway, which opened in 1890 (now part of the Northern line of the London Underground). In 1893, the world&#x27;s second third-rail powered city railway opened in Britain, the Liverpool Overhead Railway (closed 1956 and dismantled). The first US third-rail powered city railway in revenue use was the 1895 Metropolitan West Side Elevated, which soon became part of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;. In 1901, Granville Woods, a prominent African-American inventor, was granted a , covering various proposed improvements to third-rail systems. This has been cited to claim that he invented the third-rail system of current distribution. However, by that time there had been numerous other patents for electrified third-rail systems, including Thomas Edison&#x27;s of 1882, and third rails had been in successful use for over a decade, in installations including the rest of Chicago &#x27;elevateds&#x27;, as well as those used in Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, not to mention the development outside the US.

In Paris, a third rail appeared in 1900 in the main-line tunnel connecting the Gare d&#x27;Orsay to the rest of the CF Paris-Orléans network. Main-line third-rail electrification was later expanded to some suburban services.

The Woodford haulage system was used on industrial tramways, specifically in quarries and strip mines in the early decades of the 20th century. This used a 250-volt center third rail to power remotely-controlled self-propelled side dump cars. The remote control system was operated like a model railroad, with the third rail divided into multiple blocks that could be set to power, coast, or brake by switches in the control center.

Top contact or gravity type third rail seems to be the oldest form of power collection. Railways pioneering in using less hazardous types of third rail were the New York Central Railroad on the approach to New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal (1907 – another case of a third-rail mainline electrification), Philadelphia&#x27;s Market–Frankford Line (1907), and the Hochbahn in Hamburg (1912) each had bottom contact rail, also known as the Wilgus-Sprague system. However, the Manchester-Bury Line of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway tried side contact rail in 1917. These technologies appeared in wider use only at the turn of the 1920s and in the 1930s on, e.g., large-profile lines of the Berlin U-Bahn, the Berlin S-Bahn and the Moscow Metro. The Hamburg S-Bahn has used a side contact third rail at 1200 V DC since 1939.

In 1956, the world&#x27;s first rubber-tyred railway line, Line 11 of Paris Metro, opened. The conductor rail evolved into a pair of guiding rails required to keep the bogie in proper position on the new type of track. This solution was modified on the 1971 Namboku Line of Sapporo Subway, where a centrally placed guiding/return rail was used plus one power rail placed laterally as on conventional railways.

In 2004, the third-rail technology at street tram lines was in the new system of Bordeaux (2004). This is a completely new technology (see below).

Third-rail systems are not considered obsolete. There are, however, countries (particularly Japan, South Korea, Spain) more eager to adopt overhead wiring for their urban railways. But at the same time, there were (and still are) many new third-rail systems built elsewhere, including technologically advanced countries (e.g. Copenhagen Metro, Taipei Metro, Wuhan Metro). Bottom-powered railways (it may be too specific to use the term &quot;third-rail&quot;) are also usually used with systems having rubber-tyred trains, whether it is a heavy metro (except two other lines of Sapporo Subway) or a small capacity people mover (PM). New electrified railway systems tend to use overhead for regional and long-distance systems. Third-rail systems using lower voltages than overhead systems still require many more supply points.
== Model railways ==
In 1906, the Lionel electric trains became the first model trains to use a third rail to power the locomotive. Lionel track uses a third rail in the center, while the two outer rails are electrically connected together. This solved the problem two-rail model trains have when the track is arranged to loop back on itself, as ordinarily this causes a short circuit. (Even if the loop was gapped, the locomotive would create a short and stop as it crossed the gaps.) Lionel electric trains also operate on alternating current. The use of alternating current means that a Lionel locomotive cannot be reversed by changing polarity; instead, the locomotive sequences among several states (forward, neutral, backward, for example) each time it is started.

Märklin three-rail trains use a short pulse at a higher voltage than is used for powering the train, to reverse a relay within the locomotive. Märklin&#x27;s track does not have an actual third rail; instead, a series of short pins provide the current, taken up by a long &quot;shoe&quot; under the engine. This shoe is long enough to always be in contact with several pins. This is known as the stud contact system and has certain advantages when used on outdoor model railway systems. The ski collector rubs over the studs and thus inherently self cleans. When both track rails are used for the return in parallel there is much less chance of current interruption due to dirt on the line.

Many model train sets today use only two rails, usually associated with Z, N, HO or G-Gauge systems. These are typically powered by direct current (DC) where the voltage and polarity of the current controls the speed and direction of the DC motor in the train. A growing exception is Digital Command Control (DCC), where bi-polar DC is delivered to the rails at a constant voltage, along with digital signals that are decoded within the locomotive. The bi-polar DC carries digital information to indicate the command and the locomotive that is being commanded, even when multiple locomotives are present on the same track. The aforementioned Lionel O-Gauge system remains popular today as well with its three rail track and AC power implementation.

Some model railroads realistically mimic the third rail configurations of their full-sized counterparts although nearly all do not draw power from the third rail.

<doc id="338965" wikidata="Q887216" url="?curid=338965" title="Wing loading">
<text>In aerodynamics, wing loading is the total weight of an aircraft or flying animal divided by the area of its wing. The stalling speed, takeoff speed and landing speed of an aircraft are partly determined by its wing loading.

The faster an aircraft flies, the more its lift is changed by a change in angle of attack, so a smaller wing is less adversely affected by vertical gusts. Consequently, faster aircraft generally have higher wing loadings than slower aircraft in order to avoid excessive response to vertical gusts.

A higher wing loading also decreases maneuverability. The same constraints apply to winged biological organisms.

==Range of wing loadings==


==Effect on performance==
Wing loading is a useful measure of the stalling speed of an aircraft. Wings generate lift owing to the motion of air around the wing. Larger wings move more air, so an aircraft with a large wing area relative to its mass (i.e., low wing loading) will have a lower stalling speed. Therefore, an aircraft with lower wing loading will be able to take off and land at a lower speed (or be able to take off with a greater load). It will also be able to turn at a greater rate.

===Effect on takeoff and landing speeds===
The lift force &quot;L&quot; on a wing of area &quot;A&quot;, traveling at true airspeed &quot;v&quot; is given by
formula_1
where &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of air, and &quot;C&quot;L is the lift coefficient. The lift coefficient is a dimensionless number that depends on the wing cross-sectional profile and the angle of attack. At steady flight, neither climbing nor diving, the lift force and the weight are equal. With &quot;L&quot;/&quot;A&quot; = &quot;Mg&quot;/&quot;A&quot; = &quot;W&quot;S&quot;g&quot;, where &quot;M&quot; is the aircraft mass, &quot;W&quot;S = &quot;M&quot;/&quot;A&quot; the wing loading (in mass/area units, i.e. lb/ft2 or kg/m2, not force/area) and &quot;g&quot; the acceleration due to gravity, this equation gives the speed &quot;v&quot; through
formula_2
As a consequence, aircraft with the same &quot;C&quot;L at takeoff under the same atmospheric conditions will have takeoff speeds proportional to formula_3. So if an aircraft&#x27;s wing area is increased by 10% and nothing else is changed, the takeoff speed will fall by about 5%. Likewise, if an aircraft designed to take off at 150 mph grows in weight during development by 40%, its takeoff speed increases to formula_4 ≈ 177 mph.

Some flyers rely on their muscle power to gain speed for takeoff over land or water. Ground nesting and water birds have to be able to run or paddle at their takeoff speed before they can take off. The same is true for a hang-glider pilot, though they may get assistance from a downhill run. For all these, a low &quot;W&quot;S is critical, whereas passerines and cliff-dwelling birds can get airborne with higher wing loadings.

===Effect on turning performance===
To turn, an aircraft must roll in the direction of the turn, increasing the aircraft&#x27;s bank angle. Turning flight lowers the wing&#x27;s lift component against gravity and hence causes a descent. To compensate, the lift force must be increased by increasing the angle of attack by use of up elevator deflection, which increases drag. Turning can be described as &quot;climbing around a circle&quot; (wing lift is diverted to turning the aircraft), so the increase in wing angle of attack creates even more drag. The tighter the turn radius attempted, the more drag induced; this requires that power (thrust) be added to overcome the drag. The maximum rate of turn possible for a given aircraft design is limited by its wing size and available engine power: the maximum turn the aircraft can achieve and hold is its &quot;sustained turn performance&quot;. As the bank angle increases, so does the g-force applied to the aircraft, this having the effect of increasing the wing loading and also the stalling speed. This effect is also experienced during level pitching maneuvers.
As stalling is due to wing loading and maximum lift coefficient at a given altitude and speed, this limits the turning radius due to maximum load factor.
At Mach 0.85 and 0.7 lift coefficient, a wing loading of can reach a structural limit of 7.33&quot;g&quot; up to and then decreases to 2.3&quot;g&quot; at . With a wing loading of the load factor is twice smaller and barely reaches 1&quot;g&quot; at .

Aircraft with low wing loadings tend to have superior sustained turn performance because they can generate more lift for a given quantity of engine thrust. The immediate bank angle an aircraft can achieve before drag seriously bleeds off airspeed is known as its &quot;instantaneous turn performance&quot;. An aircraft with a small, highly loaded wing may have superior instantaneous turn performance, but poor sustained turn performance: it reacts quickly to control input, but its ability to sustain a tight turn is limited. A classic example is the F-104 Starfighter, which has a very small wing and high wing loading.

At the opposite end of the spectrum was the large Convair B-36: its large wings resulted in a low wing loading that could make it sustain tighter turns at high altitude than contemporary jet fighters, while the slightly later Hawker Hunter had a similar wing loading of . The Boeing 367-80 airliner prototype could be rolled at low altitudes with a wing loading of at maximum weight.

Like any body in circular motion, an aircraft that is fast and strong enough to maintain level flight at speed &quot;v&quot; in a circle of radius &quot;R&quot; accelerates towards the center at formula_5. This acceleration is caused by the inward horizontal component of the lift, formula_6, where formula_7 is the banking angle. Then from Newton&#x27;s second law,
formula_8
Solving for &quot;R&quot; gives
formula_9
The lower the wing loading, the tighter the turn.

Gliders designed to exploit thermals need a small turning circle in order to stay within the rising air column, and the same is true for soaring birds. Other birds, for example, those that catch insects on the wing, also need high maneuverability. All need low wing loadings.

===Effect on stability===
Wing loading also affects &quot;gust response&quot;, the degree to which the aircraft is affected by turbulence and variations in air density. A small wing has less area on which a gust can act, both of which serve to smooth the ride. For high-speed, low-level flight (such as a fast low-level bombing run in an attack aircraft), a small, thin, highly loaded wing is preferable: aircraft with a low wing loading are often subject to a rough, punishing ride in this flight regime. The F-15E Strike Eagle has a wing loading of (excluding fuselage contributions to the effective area), whereas most delta-wing aircraft (such as the Dassault Mirage III, for which &quot;W&quot;S = 387 kg/m2) tend to have large wings and low wing loadings.

Quantitatively, if a gust produces an upward pressure of &quot;G&quot; (in N/m2, say) on an aircraft of mass &quot;M&quot;, the upward acceleration &quot;a&quot; will, by Newton&#x27;s second law be given by
formula_10
decreasing with wing loading.

===Effect of development===
A further complication with wing loading is that it is difficult to substantially alter the wing area of an existing aircraft design (although modest improvements are possible). As aircraft are developed they are prone to &quot;weight growth&quot;—the addition of equipment and features that substantially increase the operating mass of the aircraft. An aircraft whose wing loading is moderate in its original design may end up with very high wing loading as new equipment is added. Although engines can be replaced or upgraded for additional thrust, the effects on turning and takeoff performance resulting from higher wing loading are not so easily reconciled.

===Water ballast use in gliders===
Modern gliders often use water ballast carried in the wings to increase wing loading when soaring conditions are strong. By increasing the &quot;wing loading&quot; the average speed achieved across country can be increased to take advantage of strong thermals. With a higher wing loading, a given lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at a higher airspeed than with a lower wing loading, and this allows a faster average speed across country. The ballast can be ejected overboard when conditions weaken or prior to landing.

==Design considerations==

===Fuselage lift===

A blended wing-fuselage design such as that found on the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon or Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrum helps to reduce wing loading; in such a design the fuselage generates aerodynamic lift, thus improving wing loading while maintaining high performance.

===Variable-sweep wing===
Aircraft like the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and the Panavia Tornado employ variable-sweep wings. As their wing area varies in flight so does the wing loading (although this is not the only benefit). When the wing is in the forward position takeoff and landing performance is greatly improved.

===Flaps===
Like all aircraft flaps, Fowler flaps increase the camber and hence the maximum value of lift coefficient (&quot;C&quot;Lmax) lowering the landing speed. They also increase wing area, decreasing the wing loading, which further lowers the landing speed.

High lift devices such as certain flaps allow the option of smaller wings to be used in a design in order to achieve similar landing speeds compared to an alternate design using a larger wing without a high lift device. Such options allow for higher wing loading in a design. This may result in beneficial features, such as higher cruise speeds or a reduction in bumpiness at high speed low altitude flight (the latter feature is very important for close air support aircraft roles). For instance, Lockheed&#x27;s Starfighter uses internal Blown flaps to achieve a high wing loading design (723 kg/m²) which allows it a much smoother low altitude flight at full throttle speeds compared to low wing loading delta designs such as the Mirage 2000 or Mirage III (387 kg/m²). The F-16 which has a relatively high wing loading of 689 kg/m² uses leading-edge extensions to increase wing lift at high angles of attack.

<text>Tommaso Geraci (29 June 1931 – 26 August 2020) was an Italian sculptor, worked in the Sicilian town of Cefalù.

== Life &amp; work ==
Born in Sclafani Bagni, Sicily, Geraci graduated from the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, Netherlands in fine arts and sculpture, spending a year of his studies at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan, Italy.

Geraci was awarded the Italian national honour of &quot;Cavaliere dell&#x27;Ordine della stella della Solidarietà Italiana&quot; (Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity) in 1974.

Since graduating, Geraci became well known for his sculpture, working mainly in bronze. Many of his works are symbolic, drawing on the lessons of mythology, promoting humanity, and frequently take the form of circular plaques or medallions, small and large.

Works include the 1.9 m (6 ft) diameter bronze plaque at Palermo International Airport in memory of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and a 9 m high statue of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina at Poggio Maria, Cefalù.

His works are known to be found in Denmark, Netherlands (including a monument in Leersum to the space age following the launch of Sputnik 1), Italy, and the Vatican. Geraci died on 26 August 2020 at the age of 89.

<text>Loughborough University (abbreviated as Lough or Lboro for post-nominals) is a public research university in the market town of Loughborough, Leicestershire, England. It has been a university since 1966, but it dates back to 1909, when Loughborough Technical Institute was founded. In March 2013, the university announced it had bought the former broadcast centre at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as a second campus. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £363.2 million, of which £47.8 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £251.6 million.

== History ==
The university traces its roots back to 1909, when the Loughborough Technical Institute was founded in the town centre. There followed a period of rapid expansion led by principal Herbert Schofield, during which there was renaming to Loughborough College and development of the present campus.

In early years, efforts were made to mimic the environment of an Oxbridge college, e.g. students wore gowns to lectures, while maintaining a strong practical counterbalance to academic learning. During World War I, it served as an &quot;instructional factory&quot;, training workers for the munitions industry.
=== The Loughborough colleges ===
Following the war, the institute was divided into four separate colleges:
*Loughborough Training College (teacher training)
*Loughborough College of Art (art and design)
*Loughborough College of Further Education (technical and vocational)
*Loughborough College of Technology (technology and science)

The last would become the nucleus of the present university. Its rapid expansion from a small provincial college to the first British technical university was due largely to its principals, Herbert Schofield, who led it from 1915 to 1950, and Herbert Haslegrave, who oversaw its further expansion from 1953 to 1967 and steered its progress first to a College of Advanced Technology and then to a university in 1966. In 1977, the university broadened its range of studies by amalgamating with Loughborough College of Education (formerly the Training College). More recently, in August 1998, the university merged with Loughborough College of Art and Design (LCAD). Loughborough College remains a college of further education.

=== Influence of Herbert Schofield ===
Herbert Schofield became principal in 1915, and continued to lead the College of Technology until 1950. Under his guidance, the college changed almost beyond recognition. He bought the estate of Burleigh Hall on the western outskirts of the town, which became the nucleus of the present campus. He oversaw the building of the original Hazlerigg and Rutland halls of residence, which are now home to the university&#x27;s administration and the vice-chancellor&#x27;s offices.

=== From college to university ===
An experienced educationist, Herbert Haslegrave took over as college principal in 1953. By increasing breadth and raising standards, he gained the institution the status of Colleges of Advanced Technology in 1958. He persuaded the Department of Education to buy further land and began a building programme.

In 1963, the Robbins Report on higher education recommended that all colleges of advanced technology be given university status. Loughborough College of Technology was granted a Royal Charter on 19 April 1966, and became Loughborough University of Technology (LUT), with Haslegrave as its first vice-chancellor. It gradually remodelled itself in the image of the plate glass universities of the period, which had also been created under Robbins.

=== Later history ===
In 1977, Loughborough Training College (now Loughborough College of Education) was absorbed into the university. In 1996, the university dropped the &quot;of Technology&quot; from its title, becoming Loughborough University. The Arts College was also amalgamated with the university in 1998. These additions have shifted the technological leaning of the institution, causing it to function more as a traditional university, with a combination of humanities, arts and sciences. 

The shortened name &quot;Lboro&quot;, &quot;Lufbra&quot; or &quot;Luff&quot; is commonly used by the students&#x27; union, the alumni association and others.

== Campus ==
The university&#x27;s main campus is in the town of Loughborough. That campus (once the estate of Burleigh Hall) covers an area of 523 acres, and includes academic departments, 17 halls of residence, the Students&#x27; Union, two gyms, gardens and playing fields.

Of particular interest are The Walled Garden, with its Garden of Remembrance, the Hazlerigg-Rutland Hall fountain-courtyard, The Old Cottage and the Bastard Gates donated by and named after William Bastard, the Chairman of College Governors, which form the official entrance to Rutland Hall.

In the central quadrangle of the campus stands a famous cedar tree of veteran status, with a girth of 5.12 m. The cedar has often appeared as a symbol for the university and it was heavy snowfall in December 1990 that led to the collapse of the upper canopy which gave the tree its distinctive shape.

=== Library ===

The Pilkington Library opened in 1980. It covers 98,608 sq. ft. (9,161 square metres) over four floors with 1375 study places – up from 780 prior to the renovation in late 2013. The library has a history of undertaking research in the field of library and information work.
=== Holywell Park Conference Centre ===
Holywell Park Conference Centre is a conference and meeting venue located on campus. It was used as the kitting out location for Team GB prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics.

=== University Stadium ===

The £4 million stadium for the university&#x27;s rugby and football first teams was opened in 2012 and has a capacity of 3,000. It is home to Loughborough University FC, which is one of the few university sides to play in the English football league system, currently competing in the United Counties League. The stadium includes a digital scoreboard, conference facilities and 14 changing rooms. In 2018 it hosted four matches in the group stages of the European Under-17 Championships.

== Organisation ==

Loughborough University is headed by a vice-chancellor and is organised into nine schools:

*School of Aeronautical, Automotive, Chemical and Materials Engineering &quot;(comprising the three departments of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Materials)&quot;
*School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering
*Loughborough Business School
*School of Design and Creative Arts
*Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering
*School of Science &quot;(comprising the five departments of Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematical Sciences, Mathematics Education and Physics)&quot;

*Loughborough University London &quot;(comprising the Institute for Design Innovation, Institute for Digital Technologies, Institute for Diplomacy and International Governance, Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Institute for International Management, Institute for Media and Creative Industries, Institute for Sport Business)&quot;

Each of the 9 schools has a senior leadership team consisting of deans, associate deans for education and research, and operations managers. The University Executive Board is made up of the vice-chancellor, deputy vice-chancellor, chief operating officer, chief finance officer, the pro vice-chancellors for equity, diversity and inclusion, education and research, director of organisational development and the 9 deans.

In May 2022, the university launched a new strategy called &quot;Creating Better Futures. Together&quot;, which sets out to guide Loughborough&#x27;s activities and development over the next decade. 


=== Traditions ===
The official colour of the university is African violet. The coat of arms incorporates several symbols relevant to the history of the Loughborough area, including Offa of Mercia&#x27;s cross (a symbol of the ancient kingdom of Mercia, within whose borders the town now stands) and the peafowl from the arms of the Dukes of Rutland. The motto of the university is &quot;veritate scientia labore&quot; (&quot;with truth, wisdom and labour&quot;, or, alternatively, &quot;with truth, knowledge and work&quot;, depending on the translation).

The university has a strong tradition in both engineering and sport. From its strong engineering and technical background it has now expanded, becoming a centre of excellence in the field of sports and sports science. It has graduated a number of world-class athletes including Paula Radcliffe and Lord Coe. In keeping with this tradition, Loughborough students have won the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport Association (BUCS) championship every year for four decades. The university is the home of the England and Wales Cricket Board&#x27;s National Academy, opened in November 2003.

The university (and Loughborough College before it) once had a &quot;mascot&quot; consisting of an oversized knight&#x27;s helmet with a lowered visor, commonly called &quot;Thor&quot;. This was constructed in 1958 by students of Hazlerigg-Rutland hall in the college welding shop. In the late 1980s Thor was displayed in the Students&#x27; Union foyer, but it has since gone missing.

== Academic profile ==
The university has 20 academic departments and over 100 research groups, institutes and centres currently divided between nine schools. Previously the departments and research institutes had been split between three faculties: Science, Engineering and Social Science &amp; Humanities.

It has students; of whom are undergraduates and are pursuing postgraduate courses and/or research (based on figures). Its current Chancellor is Lord Sebastian Coe, (the previous chancellor, Sir Nigel Rudd retired from the position in summer 2015, having served for five years).

Loughborough University&#x27;s vice-chancellor and president is Professor Nick Jennings CB, FREng, FRS, who took up the post in October 2021 following the departure of Robert Allison, who left the post at the end of the 2020/21 academic year.

The university has won seven Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prizes for Higher and Further Education for work with the aeronautical and automotive industries (1994); support for developing countries (1998); for a pioneering role in developing applications of modern optics and laser technologies (2000); for its world leading roles in sports research, education and development (2002); for its world leading role in social policy in recognition of its outstanding and widely respected work in evaluating and helping develop social policy-related programmes, such as those for cared for children, social security policy, crime prevention, education initiatives and young carers (2005); for recognition of its vehicle, road and driver safety research (2007); and for its impact through research and skills development in High Value Manufacturing to create economic growth (2013).

<doc id="338985" wikidata="Q2593332" url="?curid=338985" title="Business performance management">
<text>Business performance management (BPM) (also known as corporate performance management (CPM) enterprise performance management (EPM), organizational performance management, or performance management) is a management approach which encompasses a set of processes and analytical tools to ensure that an organization&#x27;s activities and output are aligned with its goals. BPM is associated with business process management, a larger framework managing organizational processes.

It aims to measure and optimize the overall performance of an organization, specific departments, individual employees, or processes to manage particular tasks. Performance standards are set by senior leadership and task owners which may include expectations for job duties, timely feedback and coaching, evaluating employee performance and behavior against desired outcomes, and implementing reward systems. BPM can involve outlining the role of each individual in an organization in terms of functions and responsibilities.

== History ==

By 2017, Gartner had reclassified CPM as &quot;financial planning and analysis&quot; (FP&amp;A) and &quot;financial close&quot; to reflect an increased focus on planning and the emergence of new solutions for financial close management.

== Definition and scope ==

New technology realizes corporate strategic outcomes and describes risk-management programs.

== Application ==
Performance-management principles are used most often in the workplace and can be applied wherever people interact with their environments to produce desired effects, such as health settings. How performance management is applied is important to get the most out of a group, and can improve day-to-day employee performance. It must not encourage internal competition, but teamwork, cooperation, and trust. 

Performance management aligns company goals with those of teams and employees to increase efficiency, productivity, and profitability. Its guidelines stipulate the activities and outcomes by which employees and teams are evaluated during performance appraisal. Many types of organizations use performance management systems (PMS) to evaluate themselves according to their targets, objectives, and goals; a research institute may use PMS to evaluate its success in reaching development targets. Complex performance drivers such as the societal contribution of research may be evaluated with other performance drivers, such as research commercialization and collaborations, in sectors like commercial agriculture. A research institute may use data-driven, real-time PMS to deal with complex performance-management challenges for a country developing its agricultural sector.

Werner Erhard, Michael C. Jensen, and their colleagues developed a new approach to improving performance in organizations. Their work emphasizes how constraints imposed by one&#x27;s worldview can impede cognitive abilities, and explores the source of performance which is inaccessible by cause-and-effect analysis. They say that a person&#x27;s performance correlates with their work situation, and language (including what is said and unsaid in conversations) plays a major role. Performance is more likely to be improved when management understands how employees perceive the world and implementing changes which are compatible with that worldview.

==Public-sector effects==
In the public sector, the effects of performance-management systems have ranged from positive to negative; this suggests that differences among systems and the context in which they are implemented affect their success or failure.

==How it can fail==

Employees who question the fairness of a performance-management system or are overly competitive will affect its effectiveness; those who do not feel adequately rewarded become disgruntled with the process. Without proper system planning, employees may view it as mandating compliance.

==Organizational development==
In organizational development (OD), performance can be thought of as actual versus desired results; where actual results fall short of those desired is the performance-improvement zone. Performance improvement aims to close the gap between the two.

Other organizational-development definitions differ slightly. According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), performance management is a system or process in which work is planned and expectations are set; performance of the work is monitored; staff ability to perform is developed; performance is rated and the ratings summarized, and top performance is rewarded.

== Design and implementation ==

An organization-wide 360-degree feedback process integrated into the organization&#x27;s culture can be a powerful tool for communicating and instituting change, rapidly touching all members of the organization when new markets, strategies, values and structures are introduced into the system. Each year, companies spend considerable money on their performance-management systems. For performance management to succeed, businesses must continue to adapt their system to correct current deficiencies. Some aspects, such as goal setting or performance bonuses, may resonate more with employees than others.

=== Outcomes ===

According to Richard et al. (2009), organizational-performance metrics encompass three outcomes:
* Financial performance, such as profits, return on assets, and return on investment
* Product market performance, such as sales and market share
* Total shareholder return, economic value added, and similar

Organizational effectiveness is a similar term.

== Technology ==
Business performance management requires large organizations to collect and report large volumes of data. Software vendors, particularly those offering business intelligence tools, offer products to assist in this process. BPM is often incorrectly understood as relying on software to work, and many definitions suggest software as essential to the approach. Interest in BPM by the software community may be sales-driven.

<text>The Socialist Labour Party (SLP) was a minor political party in Ireland formed under the leadership of Matt Merrigan (Dublin Secretary of the ATGWU) and Noël Browne, TD in 1977. Another key figure was the radical journalist Brian Trench, former head of the Communications Department at Dublin City University along with the former Clann na Poblachta TD Jack McQuillan. The founders came from the Liaison Committee of the Labour Left, which in 1975/76 had tried to build the &quot;Left Alternative&quot;, a coalition of progressive organisations and individuals, aimed at addressing what they saw as the cultural and economic impoverishment of Irish society by the establishment parties of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

The SLP regarded itself as highly progressive. It allowed for the right of factions to organise within the Party. The most notable were the &quot;Socialist Workers Tendency&quot;, organised around members of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Movement which left in 1980, the &quot;Workers Alliance for Action&quot; organised around members of the Irish Workers&#x27; Group which left in 1979 and the &quot;Republican Socialist Tendency&quot;, organised around members of People&#x27;s Democracy, which also left in 1979.

In the 1981 general election the party fielded 7 candidates, with Noël Browne elected for Dublin North-Central. Following a continuing decline in membership, the SLP was dissolved in 1982.

Although the Southern Baptist Convention was organized in 1845, no formal confession of faith was adopted until Baptist theologian Edgar Young Mullins led the denomination to adopt the original BF&amp;M in 1925. Described as &quot;the New Hampshire Confession of Faith [of 1833], revised at certain points, and with some additional articles growing out of present needs,&quot; it was intended as &quot;a reaffirmation of Christian fundamentals,&quot; which was deemed necessary because of &quot;the prevalence of naturalism in the modern teaching and preaching of religion.&quot; 

The BF&amp;M was revised in 1963 (under the chairmanship of Herschel H. Hobbs), amended in 1998 (with the addition of Section XVIII on &quot;The Family&quot;), and again revised in 2000 under the chairmanship of SBC President Adrian Rogers; the 2000 revisions incorporated sociological as well as theological changes and were considered the most controversial.

==Position Statements==
The BF&amp;M includes 18 topics which are position statements of the SBC. Each article or position is followed by Scripture which they use to support their position.

==Reception==
The significant changes to the BF&amp;M in the 2000 revision were praised and criticized.

===Affirmations===
Some of the changes that were particularly well received by some Baptist theologians include the following:
*The controversial use of the word &quot;inerrancy&quot; was not inserted into the section on scripture. Some were concerned that it would be included.
*No inclusion of more restrictive views of eschatology, such as dispensationalism. Apprehension had been expressed that such views might be espoused in the revisions.
*Inclusion of a statement that Baptists honor the principles of soul competency and the priesthood of all believers.
*Reaffirmation of most historical Baptist convictions.
*Addresses issues of contemporary concern—soteriological inclusivism (Section IV), family (Section XVIII), gender (Section III), sexual immorality, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, and abortion (Section XV).
*Clear expressions about the future direction of the SBC under the &quot;conservative resurgency&quot; leadership.
*Editorial changes, such as the use of gender-inclusive language, considered improvements in the form of the statement.

===Criticisms===
In 2001, Russell H. Dilday of the Center for Baptist Studies at Mercer University raised 12 controversial points about the 2000 revision. The most contentious points were in the areas of male priority (in marriage and in ministry, specifically the pastorate), the exegetical standard by which the Bible is to be interpreted, and a catalogue of specific sins.

====Gender-based roles====
For the first time in SBC history, provisions were added to define male-headship gender roles in ministry and marriage. Regarding ministry, the BF&amp;M now explicitly defines the pastoral office as the exclusive domain of men—thus prohibiting female pastors. While not stated in the 2000 BF&amp;M, some churches also apply this interpretation to deacons, technically a pastoral office of the church, and will not ordain women or allow them to serve as deacons.

Regarding marriage, the BF&amp;M added Article XVIII to specify that the husband is the head of the household (though this is to be understood in a complementarian role, not as an autocrat). Nothing in the BF&amp;M prohibits or discourages the wife from holding outside employment, or the husband from performing household duties traditionally considered those of the wife.

====Exegetical standard====
The 2000 revision removed the assertion that the person of Jesus was to be the exegetical standard by which the Bible was to be interpreted, and replaced it with the last sentence in the quotation below. The change was made over concerns that some groups were elevating the recorded words of Jesus in Scripture over other Scriptural passages (or, in some cases, claiming that Jesus&#x27; silence on an issue held priority over other passages explicitly discussing a topic, an example being homosexuality). The traditional SBC view is that Scripture is inspired by God.

This revision was particularly objectionable to the Baptist General Convention of Texas, the largest SBC state convention, which had previously split between moderates and conservatives, with the latter forming the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention.

====Catalogue of specific sins====
The 2000 BF&amp;M has been criticized for including a specific list of contemporary sins, which could lead to endless additions.

<text>The Vickers Vanguard was a short/medium-range turboprop airliner designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Vickers-Armstrongs.

The Vanguard was developed during the mid-to-late 1950s in response to a specification issued by British European Airways (BEA) for a 100-seat airliner; Vickers decided to design such an airliner as a follow-up to the existing Viscount series, the principal difference from which being an expanded airframe that provided considerably more internal volume. Another key innovation was the Tyne engine, which was roughly twice as powerful as the Viscount&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Dart engine, and allowed for increases in both cruising speed and altitude. Throughout the design process, the needs of two airlines, BEA and Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), heavily shaped the Vanguard&#x27;s specifics.

The Vanguard was brought into revenue service on 17 December 1960, around the same time as the commercial availability of a new generation of jet-powered airliners; as a result, these competitors quickly overshadowed its performance and led to the type being largely ignored by the market. Only 44 aircraft were ever built, the type having been ordered by BEA and TCA. After only about ten years&#x27; service, TCA experimentally converted one of its Vanguards to a freighter configuration, calling it the Cargoliner. Considered to be a success, the majority of Vanguards were converted into freighters during the early 1970s, those from BEA becoming the Merchantman. As a freighter, the type remained in service for many years, the final example being retired in 1996.

==Development==

===Background===
The origins of the Vanguard can be traced back to speculative discussions between Vickers and the airline British European Airways (BEA) conducted as early as 1953, the same year in which the commercially successful Vickers Viscount airliner first entered revenue service. Even at this early stage, the two firms had envisioned the introduction of a successor to the Viscount entering service around 1959. This envisioned successor airliner would possess economics 10 per cent greater than those of the Viscount, while also being considerably faster throughout all operational stages. Out of BEA&#x27;s internal analysis of various options, which studied both turboprop and pure jet propulsion arrangements, it became clear that a larger aircraft that could accommodate bigger payloads was highly desirable.

On 19 April 1953, BEA&#x27;s chief executive, Peter Masefield, outlined the company&#x27;s requirements in a letter to Vickers; these criteria included a cruise speed of , a standard range of , with in reserve fuel, the ability to accommodate up to 100 passengers, and an explicit preference for a high-wing configuration. Coincidentally, another airline, Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), also made contact with the manufacturer with its own list of requirements, calling for a Viscount-like airliner capable of servicing its transcontinental routes while carrying up to 60 passengers. Recognising the potential to fulfil both airlines&#x27; requirements in a single airliner, Vickers&#x27; design team commenced work on producing such an aircraft. 

Vicker&#x27;s initial proposal, known as the &quot;Type 870&quot; or alternatively as the &quot;Viscount Major&quot;, was incapable of meeting BEA&#x27;s criteria, and was quickly dismissed. On 14 May 1951, Vickers met with Rolls-Royce representatives to discuss potential engines for their envisioned airliner; the meeting led to the decision to adopt the in-development Rolls-Royce Tyne powerplant for its revised proposal. While considerations towards adopting a turbojets engine were made, a study performed in November 1953 found that such an engine would produce inferior performance over shorter routes to a turboprop counterpart. It was around this time that Vickers&#x27; design team also discarded notions of adopting a swept wing, largely due to its providing little benefit at the envisioned airliner&#x27;s cruise speed, as well as its inferior performance during the approach stage of flight.

===Redesign===
Despite BEA&#x27;s initial preference for a high-mounted wing, the company opted for a low-mounted wing following the adoption of a &quot;double-bubble&quot; fuselage. This type of fuselage was necessary because of the large proportion of freight which BEA needed to carry. It was considered by Vickers to be impractical if carried at the same level as the passengers due to the excessive length that would be required, but carrying the freight in a lengthy hold beneath the main cabin was a practical arrangement. Furthermore, TCA wanted a low-mounted wing, which would make the aircraft easier to refuel, de-ice and service, as well as giving a statistically significant improvement in survival in the event of a water landing.

By 13 April 1955, the range of design studies had been shortlisted down to five, these remaining concepts were jointly evaluated by BEA and Vickers. Of these submissions, it was recognised that the combination of the low-mounted wing and the double-bubble fuselage represented the optimum configuration, having offered the best capacity and versatility amongst other attributes. This conceptual aircraft, referred to as the &quot;Type 870 Scheme 16a&quot;, could accommodate 88 passengers, a cruising speed of at , and payload of . While BEA were interested in relatively short, sub-1000 mile, routes, its fuel tanks were progressively enlarged over several revisions to give a range of so that the airliner would be acceptable to TCA as well.

The &quot;Type 900&quot; was a further revision of the design, featuring an expanded payload capacity of and carry up to 93 passengers. Following some relatively minor revisions, which largely bolstered the gross weight upwards, that were made to better suit the design to the needs of global customers, the definitive &quot;Type 950&quot; proposal emerged. On 20 July 1960, BEA placed an initial order for 20 Type 950s, the type becoming subsequently known as the &quot;Vanguard&quot;; the airline publicly announced the order and its intended plan for the new airliner to succeed the Viscount in its fleet.

At the time, TCA was, while intensely interested in the airliner, not yet willing to commit itself, partially due to the basic model not entirely fulfilling its requirements, such as the level of capacity for air mail. Vickers recognised that a high-density seating configuration, accommodating up to 139 passengers to be carried, would likely be attractive to more operators, and designed the &quot;Type 952&quot; model for this market. Following a particularly vigorous evaluation, during early January 1957, TCA announced that it had placed an order for 20 Type 952s. With a follow-on order for three more aircraft, it would be, measured in dollar worth, the largest single export deal in postwar Britain&#x27;s history at that time.

===Into production===
The launch of the programme commenced immediately following BEA&#x27;s initial order for the type. Due to the substantial growth of the airliner during the concept phase, engine supplier Rolls-Royce set about scaling up the Tyne engine from its initial output of to at least . As the Vanguard&#x27;s production line was coming online at Vickers&#x27; Weybridge facility, BEA recognised that, due to the typically short length of its routes, a higher density economy seating configuration could be adopted without impacting performance. Accordingly, on 23 July 1957, Vickers announced a new model, the &quot;Type 953&quot;, which could handle payloads of up to , which greatly improved the operating costs for BEA&#x27;s preferred model; the airline quickly converted its order to six Type 951s and 14 Type 953s.

On 20 January 1959, the first Type 950 prototype &quot;G-AOYW&quot; conducted its maiden flight. The flight, a transfer to Wisley three miles away, had been planned for December but the engines were returned to Rolls-Royce for minor work. Proper flight testing was then carried out from Wisley. While development proceeded relatively smoothly, apart from over 2,000 flights being required to resolve unacceptable stalling characteristics, the last weeks of trials with BEA in early 1960 uncovered some engine-related difficulties, necessitating a brief delay while the compressor rotor was modified. With the issue resolved, the Vanguard entered revenue service with TCA on 1 February 1961, and with BEA one month later.

However, by the time of the Vanguard&#x27;s entry to service, the attitudes of the travelling public had shifted in favour of the new bypass jet engines which did not use propellers. Passengers typically preferred the additional speed, even at the disadvantage of greater operating costs and thus higher ticket prices, that came with jet-powered airliners. As such, the turboprop-powered Vanguard did not sell well, although those examples that were introduced typically performed well in numerous capacities, and often had lengthy service lives.

==Design==
The Vickers Vanguard was a turboprop-powered airliner designed for short- and medium-range services. The principal difference between the Vanguard and the preceding Viscount was in the construction of the fuselage; the Vanguard lower fuselage was similar to that of the Viscount but the top section had a larger-diameter giving a &quot;double bubble&quot; cross-section (somewhat similar to the Boeing Stratocruiser). The primary result of the larger upper portion was a more spacious interior, along with an increase in cargo capacity below the floor of the main cabin. A low-mounted straight wing was also adopted for the type, despite considerations towards shoulder-mounted and swept-wing alternatives. Aviation author C. F. Andrews observed the design to be orthodox in practically every respect.

The Vanguard&#x27;s larger and heavier fuselage presented an obvious need to be combined with a more powerful engine, which led to the adoption of the newly-developed Rolls-Royce Tyne engine. This powerplant was capable of generating a nominal , in comparison to the Viscount&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Dart of about . The Tyne engine enabled the Vanguard to be operated at a substantially greater service ceiling and cruising speed. The Vanguard was one of the fastest turboprop airliners to ever be built, including much later designs such as the Saab 2000 and de Havilland Canada Dash 8. A pilot report describes maintaining altitude with three engines at idle power and propellers feathered and the port outer engine at maximum cruise power.

The flight deck of the Vanguard was particularly spacious for the era. The flying controls were designed with manual operation in mind and were aerodynamically balanced. In spite of this arrangement, according to Andrews, the onboard electrical systems were a major advance over the previous generation of airliners; amongst other capabilities, the engines could be started without the aid of a ground support cart. The Vanguard possessed relatively docile stall characteristics, in part due to the dihedral positioning of its horizontal stabiliser, which kept it clear of the jet efflux from the engines and aided longitudinal stability. However, acceptable stalling behaviour only came after an extensive programme of over 2,000 stalls to correct initial very violent tendencies which included rolling inverted.

==Operational history==

The Vanguard entered service with BEA and TCA in late 1960. BEA operated its first Vanguard schedule on 17 December from Heathrow to Paris. Following delivery of its full fleet of six V951 and 14 V953 aircraft by 30 March 1962, the type took over many of BEA&#x27;s busier European and UK trunk routes. The aircraft received names of famous Royal Navy warships; the first (registered G-APEA) was named &quot;Vanguard&quot;, however by the time that the aircraft were delivered, BEA had adopted its new &quot;red square&quot; livery, which saw the end of naming and none of the Vanguards actually carried a name. Initial seating was 18 first-class at the rear and 108 tourist, but this was changed to 139 all-tourist, in which configuration the Vanguard had very low operating costs per seat-mile. On flights up to , such as from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, the type could match the block times of the pure jets which were being introduced in the early 1960s. The remaining BEA fleet passed to British Airways (BA) on 1 April 1974 and the last BA passenger flight with the type was on 16 June 1974.

TCA initiated Vanguard schedules on 1 February 1961 with two flights from Toronto and Montreal via intermediate stops to Vancouver. The fleet was also used on services from Toronto and Montreal to New York and Nassau, Bahamas. Tyne engine reliability was a concern to the airline in the early 1960s. It had a Constellation on stand-by at Dorval Airport in Montreal and at Toronto to take Vanguard passengers in case an engine failed to start. 

===Cargo operations===

In 1966, Air Canada removed all the seats from one of its aircraft and refitted for pure cargo work, in which role it could carry of freight. Known by the airline as the &quot;Cargoliner&quot;, it was the only such conversion, but survived to be the last Canadian Vanguard to be retired in December 1972.

BEA operated nine Vanguards modified to the V953C &quot;Merchantman&quot; all-cargo layout from 1969, with the first two conversions being designed and carried out by Aviation Traders Engineering Ltd (ATEL) at Southend Airport. BEA modified the remainder at Heathrow using kits from ATEL. A large forward cargo door measuring was incorporated. The Merchantmen continued in service with BA until late 1979 when the remaining five were sold.

Air Bridge Carriers purchased several of the Merchantmen and operated them until 1992, when it changed its name to Hunting Cargo Airlines. Hunting Cargo operated its last V953C flight on 30 September 1996 and donated the aircraft, registered &quot;G-APEP&quot;, to Brooklands Museum on 17 October 1996.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 27 October 1965, British European Airways Vanguard registration G-APEE, flying from Edinburgh Airport to London Heathrow Airport, during a landing in poor visibility attempted an overshoot but crashed on runway 28R. All on board died – 6 crew and 30 passengers.
* On 2 October 1971, British European Airways Flight 706 operated by Vanguard G-APEC, crashed near Aarsele in Belgium. The cause was the failure of the rear pressure bulkhead and subsequent destruction of the tailplane. All 8 crew and 55 passengers died.

<doc id="338997" wikidata="Q4257411" url="?curid=338997" title="Labor Party (United States, 1996)">
<text>The Labor Party (LP) was a social democratic political party in the United States of America. LP formed at a national convention of unions and labor activists in 1996.

The LP collapsed after its founder, Tony Mazzocchi, died in 2002. The party became defunct in 2007, except for the branch in South Carolina, which became the South Carolina Workers Party.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1989, members of Socialist Alternative in AFSCME created the Campaign for a Labor Party (CLP). CLP meetings persuaded Mazzochi that enough support existed in unions for a labor party, and he created Labor Party Advocates in 1990.

The Labor Party was officially formed in 1996 by the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, United Mine Workers, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, American Federation of Government Employees, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, California Nurses Association, Farm Labor Organizing Committee and hundreds of other local labor unions. Delegates to the founding convention adopted a 16-point program called &quot;A Call for Economic Justice.&quot;

=== Fissures ===
From the beginning a dispute over the Party&#x27;s running of candidates arose with many of the official unions totally opposed to running candidates that might cause the defeat of their normal Democratic allies. Smaller locals and left union activists on the other had pushed for a clean break with the Democratic Party. This issue was debated internally for years until 1999 when the Party&#x27;s leadership agreed to some endorsements of Labor Party members running.

=== Demise ===
After the 2000 elections, even symbolic support dripped away. In 2002, founding national organizer Tony Mazzocchi died. Mark Dudzic confirmed that the national party had suspended operations in 2007.

=== South Carolina ===
Despite national decline, the South Carolina chapter remained active. It has run several third-party candidates, in contrast to the national Labor Party.

In 2023, members of the SC branch called a convention, ended their affiliation with the (defunct) Labor Party, and renamed to the South Carolina Workers Party.

== Election results ==
In 2001 the Labor Party endorsed labor-sponsored independent candidates in San Francisco and Ohio local elections.

<doc id="338999" wikidata="Q1812538" url="?curid=338999" title="William Kissam Vanderbilt">
<text>William Kissam Vanderbilt I (December 12, 1849 – July 22, 1920) was an American heir, businessman, philanthropist, and horse breeder. Born into the Vanderbilt family, he managed his family&#x27;s railroad investments.

==Early life==
William Kissam Vanderbilt I was born on December 12, 1849, in New Dorp, New York, on Staten Island. His parents were Maria Louisa Kissam and William Henry Vanderbilt, the eldest son of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, an heir to his fortune and a prominent member of the Vanderbilt family who was the richest American after he took over his father&#x27;s fortune in 1877 until his own death in 1885.

He was the third of eight children born to his parents. His siblings were Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt, Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, Florence Adele Vanderbilt, Frederick William Vanderbilt, Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt, and George Washington Vanderbilt II.

==Career==
Vanderbilt inherited $55 million (equal to about $ billion today) from his father in 1885. He managed his family railroad investments. In 1879, after taking over P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Great Roman Hippodrome which was on railroad property by Madison Square Park, he renamed the facility Madison Square Garden.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Vanderbilt was one of the founders of The Jockey Club. He was a shareholder and president of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track in Brooklyn, New York, and the owner of a successful racing stable. In 1881, he built the American Horse Exchange at 50th Street (Manhattan) and Broadway. In 1911 he leased it (and eventually sold it to) the Shubert Organization who then transformed it into the Winter Garden Theatre.

After his divorce from Alva, he moved to France where he built a château and established the Haras du Quesnay horse racing stable and breeding farm near Deauville in France&#x27;s famous horse region of Lower Normandy. Among the horses he owned was the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame filly Maskette, purchased from Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for broodmare services at his French breeding farm.
Vanderbilt&#x27;s horses won a number of important races in France including:
* Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte: Prestige (1905), Northeast (1907), Montrose II (1911)
* Critérium de Saint-Cloud: Illinois II (1901), Marigold (1902)
* Grand Critérium: Prestige (1905), Montrose II (1911)
* Grand Prix de Deauville: Turenne (1904), Maintenon (1906)
* Grand Prix de Paris: Northeast (1908), Brumelli (1917)
* Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud: Maintenon (1906), Sea Sick (1908), Oversight (1910)
* Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains: McKinley (1919)

* Prix La Rochette: Schuyler (1907), Manfred (1910), Brume (1910), Pétulance (1911)
* Prix Royal-Oak: Maintenon (1906), Reinhart (1910)

==Personal life==
On April 20, 1875, Vanderbilt married his first wife, Alva Erskine Smith, daughter of Murray Forbes Smith and Phoebe Ann Desha. Together, they had three children:

* Consuelo Vanderbilt (born March 2, 1877)
* William Kissam Vanderbilt II (born on October 26, 1878)
* Harold Stirling Vanderbilt (born on July 6, 1884)

Alva later coerced Consuelo into marrying Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough on November 6, 1895. Alva divorced Vanderbilt in March 1895, at a time when divorce was rare among the elite, and received a large financial settlement reported to be in excess of $10 million (equal to about $ million today). The grounds for divorce were allegations of Vanderbilt&#x27;s adultery. Indeed, one account of cheating on his wife was with none other than the Duchess of Manchester, Consuelo Yznaga, also known as his wife&#x27;s best friend. Alva remarried to one of their old family friends, Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, on January 11, 1896.

In 1903, Vanderbilt married Anne Harriman, daughter of banker Oliver Harriman. She was a widow to sportsman Samuel Stevens Sands and to Lewis Morris Rutherfurd Jr., son of the astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd. Her second husband had died in Switzerland in 1901. She had two sons by her first marriage and two daughters by her second marriage. She had no children by Vanderbilt.

===Residences===

Like other prominent Vanderbilts, he built magnificent houses. His residences included Idle Hour (1900) on Long Island and Marble House (1892), designed by Richard Morris Hunt, in Newport, Rhode Island. Hunt also designed Vanderbilt&#x27;s 660 Fifth Avenue mansion (1883).

In 1907, Vanderbilt and his second wife built Château Vanderbilt, a Louis XIII style manor house along with three thoroughbred race tracks in Carrières-sous-Poissy, an hour outside Paris and on the route to Deauville, famous for its horse racing.

Vanderbilt was a co-owner of the yacht &quot;Defender&quot;, which won the 1895 America&#x27;s Cup and briefly owned the large steam yacht &quot;Consuelo&quot;. Vanderbilt was a founder and president of the New Theatre.

Vanderbilt made significant charitable contributions to Vanderbilt University, a private university in Nashville, Tennessee, named for his grandfather.

===Death and legacy===
Vanderbilt died in Paris on July 22, 1920. His remains were brought home and interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum in New Dorp, Staten Island, New York.

Vanderbilt&#x27;s portrait, painted by F. W. Wright from an original painting by Richard Hall between 1911 and 1921, was donated to Vanderbilt University in 1921; it is hung in Kirkland Hall.

Founding member of the Jekyll Island Club aka The Millionaires Club on Jekyll Island, Georgia.

===Estate===

Contemporary estimates reported in newspapers in August 1920 speculated that the total estate of Vanderbilt was between $40,000,000 to $100,000,000. The law firm Anderson &amp; Anderson published a summary of the contents of Vanderbilt’s Will, which included:
*$250,000 to Vanderbilt University 
* $50,000 to St Mark’s Church at Islip, Long Island 
* Several fine old masterpiece artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
* A life interest in 10 &amp; 11 Rue Leroux, Paris, and the Chateau in Calvador, Normandy, to his Widow for her lifetime, and thereafter to his daughter Consuelo 
* $2,500,000 to Consuelo to fulfil the terms of her marriage settlement 
* A further $2,500,000 in securities to be held in Trust for Consuelo by her brothers Harold and William Jr, with the income to be paid to Consuelo for her life, with the principal to be paid to her children
* The Idle Hour Estate in Long Island to Harold
* Property on Wheatland Avenue, and personal property in Marble House, Newport, to whichever of his sons would become owner of Marble House following the death of their mother Alva Beaumont 
* $1,000,000 to be held in Trust for his grandson William K. Vanderbilt III
* $100,000 each to his step-daughters Margaret Rutherfurd Mills and Barabara Rutherfurd Hatch 
* The Residuary Estate in Equal Shares to his sons William K. Vanderbilt Jr and Harold S. Vanderbilt 

No provision was made as to the appointment of the $5,000,000 Trust he had received under his father’s Will, which was distributed to his three children in equal shares as per the Terms of the Trust.

The Gross Value of the Estate was reported to be $54,530,966.59 following the decree fixing the income tax payable in the Suffolk County Surrogate’s Court on 6 March 1923. His sons William Vanderbilt Jr and Harold Vanderbilt received $21,252,757.38 and $21,739,867.38 respectively after the deduction of all debts, expenses, administration, attorney’s fees, and the levying of New York State Estate Tax of $1,934,571.73 and Federal Estate Tax of $11,459,290.16. 

Contemporary reports also suggest that Vanderbilt gifted $15,000,000 to his daughter Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan, and $1,000,000 each to her sons The Marquess of Blandford and Lord Ivor Churchill several months prior to his death.

<doc id="339008" wikidata="Q1144707" url="?curid=339008" title="2003 Japanese general election">
<text>General elections were held in Japan on November 9, 2003. Incumbent Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the Liberal Democratic Party won the most seats in the House of Representatives but failed to secure a majority. The main opposition Democratic Party made considerable gains, winning 177 of the 480 seats in the House of Representatives, its largest share ever. Other traditional parties like the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party lost substantial numbers of seats, marking the start of a newly consolidated two-party system in Japanese politics, which would end in 2012 with the emergence of Japan Restoration Party.

==Background==
On October 11, 2003, following his re-election as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party on September 20, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi dissolved the House of Representatives of Japan&#x27;s Diet. This action was in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan, which grants the Prime Minister the authority to dissolve the lower house after consulting the Emperor.

This election marked the first since Koizumi assumed the role of Prime Minister in April 2001. The primary contenders were the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Party (DPJ). The LDP continued to enjoy robust support in rural regions and among the elderly, largely due to substantial agricultural subsidies, while the DPJ was more popular with younger voters and in urban centers. Nonetheless, the LDP was favored due to the disproportionate influence of less populated rural districts within Japan&#x27;s electoral framework.

Key issues addressed by the candidates included the persistent economic recession, known as the Lost Decades; reforms to the public pension system; the level of Japan&#x27;s involvement in Iraq in support of the U.S.; relations with North Korea; and the privatization of Japan Post Holdings and highways in the Tokyo area.

The preceding general election for the Lower House occurred in June 2000 under the leadership of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.

==Results==
National newspapers have reported that the recent election was more favorable to the Democratic Party (DPJ) than to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The DPJ secured a plurality of votes and added 40 seats, becoming the largest opposition party with 177 seats in the lower house. Within the ruling coalition, only New Kōmeitō saw an increase, raising its membership from 31 to 34. Despite Prime Minister Koizumi&#x27;s high approval ratings, the LDP did not gain additional seats, leading some analysts to view Koizumi as a weakened Prime Minister. However, others note that several non-partisan members were actually aligned with the LDP, including Kato Koichi, suggesting the LDP effectively maintained its seat count.

The LDP was successful in rural regions, whereas the DPJ excelled in urban centers. Voter turnout was 59.86%, marking it the second-lowest since 1945. The new house members had an average age of 51.03 years, which is 3.2 years younger than the previous election&#x27;s average. A majority of the new members, 302, were born post-1945. Post-election, the number of women in the lower house fell to 34 from the previous 35.

Early poll data and exit polls underscored the impact of swing voters, who comprised 18% of the electorate. The Asahi Shimbun reported that over half of these voters chose the DPJ. Exit polls initially produced varied forecasts, with one predicting the DPJ would secure as many as 230 seats, over 50 more than the actual outcome.

The Liberal Democratic Party did not secure a majority on its own, necessitating the continuation of its coalition with New Kōmeitō and the New Conservative Party.

<doc id="339024" wikidata="Q836595" url="?curid=339024" title="Length contraction">
<text>Length contraction is the phenomenon that a moving object&#x27;s length is measured to be shorter than its proper length, which is the length as measured in the object&#x27;s own rest frame. It is also known as Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction (after Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald) and is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Length contraction is only in the direction in which the body is travelling. For standard objects, this effect is negligible at everyday speeds, and can be ignored for all regular purposes, only becoming significant as the object approaches the speed of light relative to the observer.

==History==

Length contraction was postulated by George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1892) to explain the negative outcome of the Michelson–Morley experiment and to rescue the hypothesis of the stationary aether (Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis).
Although both FitzGerald and Lorentz alluded to the fact that electrostatic fields in motion were deformed (&quot;Heaviside-Ellipsoid&quot; after Oliver Heaviside, who derived this deformation from electromagnetic theory in 1888), it was considered an ad hoc hypothesis, because at this time there was no sufficient reason to assume that intermolecular forces behave the same way as electromagnetic ones. In 1897 Joseph Larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin, and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of this model. Yet it was shown by Henri Poincaré (1905) that electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain the electron&#x27;s stability. So he had to introduce another ad hoc hypothesis: non-electric binding forces (Poincaré stresses) that ensure the electron&#x27;s stability, give a dynamical explanation for length contraction, and thus hide the motion of the stationary aether.

Lorentz believed that length contraction represented a &quot;physical contraction&quot; of the atoms making up an object. He envisioned no fundamental change in the nature of space and time.
Lorentz expected that length contraction would result in compressive strains in an object that should result in measurable effects. Such effects would include optical effects in transparent media, such as optical rotation and induction of double refraction, and the induction of torques on charged condensers moving at an angle with respect to the aether.

Lorentz was perplexed by experiments such as the Trouton–Noble experiment and the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace, which failed to validate his theoretical expectations.

For mathematical consistency, Lorentz proposed a new time variable, the &quot;local time&quot;, called that because it depended on the position of a moving body, following the relation . Lorentz considered local time not to be &quot;real&quot;; rather, it represented an ad hoc change of variable.

Impressed by Lorentz&#x27;s &quot;most ingenious idea&quot;, Poincaré saw more in local time than a mere mathematical trick. It represented the actual time that would be shown on a moving observer&#x27;s clocks. On the other hand, Poincaré did not consider this measured time to be the &quot;true time&quot; that would be exhibited by clocks at rest in the aether. Poincaré made no attempt to redefine the concepts of space and time. To Poincaré, Lorentz transformation described the &quot;apparent&quot; states of the field for a moving observer. &quot;True states&quot; remained those defined with respect to the ether.

Albert Einstein (1905) is credited with removing the ad hoc character from the contraction hypothesis, by deriving this contraction from his postulates instead of experimental data. Hermann Minkowski gave the geometrical interpretation of all relativistic effects by introducing his concept of four-dimensional spacetime.

==Basis in relativity==
First it is necessary to carefully consider the methods for measuring the lengths of resting and moving objects. Here, &quot;object&quot; simply means a distance with endpoints that are always mutually at rest, &quot;i.e.&quot;, that are at rest in the same inertial frame of reference. If the relative velocity between an observer (or his measuring instruments) and the observed object is zero, then the proper length formula_1 of the object can simply be determined by directly superposing a measuring rod. However, if the relative velocity is greater than zero, then one can proceed as follows:
The observer installs a row of clocks that either are synchronized a) by exchanging light signals according to the Poincaré–Einstein synchronization, or b) by &quot;slow clock transport&quot;, that is, one clock is transported along the row of clocks in the limit of vanishing transport velocity. Now, when the synchronization process is finished, the object is moved along the clock row and every clock stores the exact time when the left or the right end of the object passes by. After that, the observer only has to look at the position of a clock A that stored the time when the left end of the object was passing by, and a clock B at which the right end of the object was passing by &quot;at the same time&quot;. It&#x27;s clear that distance AB is equal to length formula_2 of the moving object. Using this method, the definition of simultaneity is crucial for measuring the length of moving objects.

Another method is to use a clock indicating its proper time formula_3, which is traveling from one endpoint of the rod to the other in time formula_4 as measured by clocks in the rod&#x27;s rest frame. The length of the rod can be computed by multiplying its travel time by its velocity, thus formula_5 in the rod&#x27;s rest frame or formula_6 in the clock&#x27;s rest frame.

In Newtonian mechanics, simultaneity and time duration are absolute and therefore both methods lead to the equality of formula_2 and formula_1. Yet in relativity theory the constancy of light velocity in all inertial frames in connection with relativity of simultaneity and time dilation destroys this equality. In the first method an observer in one frame claims to have measured the object&#x27;s endpoints simultaneously, but the observers in all other inertial frames will argue that the object&#x27;s endpoints were &quot;not&quot; measured simultaneously. In the second method, times formula_4 and formula_3 are not equal due to time dilation, resulting in different lengths too.

The deviation between the measurements in all inertial frames is given by the formulas for Lorentz transformation and time dilation (see Derivation). It turns out that the proper length remains unchanged and always denotes the greatest length of an object, and the length of the same object measured in another inertial reference frame is shorter than the proper length. This contraction only occurs along the line of motion, and can be represented by the relation
:formula_11

where
*formula_2 is the length observed by an observer in motion relative to the object
*formula_13 is the proper length (the length of the object in its rest frame)
*formula_14 is the &quot;Lorentz factor&quot;, defined as formula_15 where
**formula_16 is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object
**formula_17 is the speed of light

Replacing the Lorentz factor in the original formula leads to the relation
:formula_18

In this equation both formula_2 and formula_13 are measured parallel to the object&#x27;s line of movement. For the observer in relative movement, the length of the object is measured by subtracting the simultaneously measured distances of both ends of the object. For more general conversions, see the Lorentz transformations. An observer at rest observing an object travelling very close to the speed of light would observe the length of the object in the direction of motion as very near zero.

Then, at a speed of (30 million mph, 0.0447) contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of (95 million mph, 0.141), the length is still 99%. As the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light, the effect becomes prominent.

== Symmetry ==
The principle of relativity (according to which the laws of nature are invariant across inertial reference frames) requires that length contraction is symmetrical: If a rod is at rest in an inertial frame formula_21, it has its proper length in formula_21 and its length is contracted in formula_23. However, if a rod rests in formula_23, it has its proper length in formula_23 and its length is contracted in formula_21. This can be vividly illustrated using symmetric Minkowski diagrams, because the Lorentz transformation geometrically corresponds to a rotation in four-dimensional spacetime.

== Magnetic forces ==

Magnetic forces are caused by relativistic contraction when electrons are moving relative to atomic nuclei. The magnetic force on a moving charge next to a current-carrying wire is a result of relativistic motion between electrons and protons.

In 1820, André-Marie Ampère showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another. In the electrons&#x27; frame of reference, the moving wire contracts slightly, causing the protons of the opposite wire to be locally &quot;denser&quot;. As the electrons in the opposite wire are moving as well, they do not contract (as much). This results in an apparent local imbalance between electrons and protons; the moving electrons in one wire are attracted to the extra protons in the other. The reverse can also be considered. To the static proton&#x27;s frame of reference, the electrons are moving and contracted, resulting in the same imbalance. The electron drift velocity is relatively very slow, on the order of a meter an hour but the force between an electron and proton is so enormous that even at this very slow speed the relativistic contraction causes significant effects.

This effect also applies to magnetic particles without current, with current being replaced with electron spin.

==Experimental verifications==
Any observer co-moving with the observed object cannot measure the object&#x27;s contraction, because he can judge himself and the object as at rest in the same inertial frame in accordance with the principle of relativity (as it was demonstrated by the Trouton–Rankine experiment). So length contraction cannot be measured in the object&#x27;s rest frame, but only in a frame in which the observed object is in motion. In addition, even in such a non-co-moving frame, &quot;direct&quot; experimental confirmations of length contraction are hard to achieve, because (a) at the current state of technology, objects of considerable extension cannot be accelerated to relativistic speeds, and (b) the only objects traveling with the speed required are atomic particles, whose spatial extensions are too small to allow a direct measurement of contraction.

However, there are &quot;indirect&quot; confirmations of this effect in a non-co-moving frame:
*It was the negative result of a famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson–Morley experiment (and later also the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times &quot;L&quot;/(&quot;c&quot;−&quot;v&quot;) and &quot;L&quot;/(&quot;c&quot;+&quot;v&quot;) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion &amp; orientation.
* Given the thickness of the atmosphere as measured in Earth&#x27;s reference frame, muons&#x27; extremely short lifespan shouldn&#x27;t allow them to make the trip to the surface, even at the speed of light, but they do nonetheless. From the Earth reference frame, however, this is made possible only by the muon&#x27;s time being slowed down by time dilation. However, in the muon&#x27;s frame, the effect is explained by the atmosphere being contracted, shortening the trip.
*Heavy ions that are spherical when at rest should assume the form of &quot;pancakes&quot; or flat disks when traveling nearly at the speed of lightand in fact, the results obtained from particle collisions can only be explained when the increased nucleon density due to length contraction is considered.
* The ionization ability of electrically charged particles with large relative velocities is higher than expected. In pre-relativistic physics the ability should decrease at high velocities, because the time in which ionizing particles in motion can interact with the electrons of other atoms or molecules is diminished; however, in relativity, the higher-than-expected ionization ability can be explained by length contraction of the Coulomb field in frames in which the ionizing particles are moving, which increases their electrical field strength normal to the line of motion. 
* In synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, relativistic electrons were injected into an undulator, so that synchrotron radiation is generated. In the proper frame of the electrons, the undulator is contracted which leads to an increased radiation frequency. Additionally, to find out the frequency as measured in the laboratory frame, one has to apply the relativistic Doppler effect. So, only with the aid of length contraction and the relativistic Doppler effect, the extremely small wavelength of undulator radiation can be explained.

==Reality of length contraction==

In 1911 Vladimir Varićak asserted that one sees the length contraction in an objective way, according to Lorentz, while it is &quot;only an apparent, subjective phenomenon, caused by the manner of our clock-regulation and length-measurement&quot;, according to Einstein. Einstein published a rebuttal:

Einstein also argued in that paper, that length contraction is not simply the product of &quot;arbitrary&quot; definitions concerning the way clock regulations and length measurements are performed. He presented the following thought experiment: Let A&#x27;B&#x27; and A&quot;B&quot; be the endpoints of two rods of the same proper length &quot;L&quot;0, as measured on x&#x27; and x&quot; respectively. Let them move in opposite directions along the x* axis, considered at rest, at the same speed with respect to it. Endpoints A&#x27;A&quot; then meet at point A*, and B&#x27;B&quot; meet at point B*. Einstein pointed out that length A*B* is shorter than A&#x27;B&#x27; or A&quot;B&quot;, which can also be demonstrated by bringing one of the rods to rest with respect to that axis.

==Paradoxes==
Due to superficial application of the contraction formula, some paradoxes can occur. Examples are the ladder paradox and Bell&#x27;s spaceship paradox. However, those paradoxes can be solved by a correct application of the relativity of simultaneity. Another famous paradox is the Ehrenfest paradox, which proves that the concept of rigid bodies is not compatible with relativity, reducing the applicability of Born rigidity, and showing that for a co-rotating observer the geometry is in fact non-Euclidean.

==Visual effects==
Length contraction refers to measurements of position made at simultaneous times according to a coordinate system. This could suggest that if one could take a picture of a fast moving object, that the image would show the object contracted in the direction of motion. However, such visual effects are completely different measurements, as such a photograph is taken from a distance, while length contraction can only directly be measured at the exact location of the object&#x27;s endpoints. It was shown by several authors such as Roger Penrose and James Terrell that moving objects generally do not appear length contracted on a photograph. This result was popularized by Victor Weisskopf in a Physics Today article. For instance, for a small angular diameter, a moving sphere remains circular and is rotated. This kind of visual rotation effect is called Penrose-Terrell rotation.

==Derivation==

Length contraction can be derived in several ways:

=== Known moving length ===
In an inertial reference frame S, let formula_27 and formula_28 denote the endpoints of an object in motion. In this frame the object&#x27;s length formula_2 is measured, according to the above conventions, by determining the simultaneous positions of its endpoints at formula_30. Meanwhile, the proper length of this object, as measured in its rest frame S&#x27;, can be calculated by using the Lorentz transformation. Transforming the time coordinates from S into S&#x27; results in different times, but this is not problematic, since the object is at rest in S&#x27; where it does not matter when the endpoints are measured. Therefore, the transformation of the spatial coordinates suffices, which gives:

:formula_31

Since formula_32, and by setting formula_33 and formula_34, the proper length in S&#x27; is given by

Therefore, the object&#x27;s length, measured in the frame S, is contracted by a factor formula_35:

Likewise, according to the principle of relativity, an object that is at rest in S will also be contracted in S&#x27;. By exchanging the above signs and primes symmetrically, it follows that

Thus an object at rest in S, when measured in S&#x27;, will have the contracted length

=== Known proper length ===
Conversely, if the object rests in S and its proper length is known, the simultaneity of the measurements at the object&#x27;s endpoints has to be considered in another frame S&#x27;, as the object constantly changes its position there. Therefore, both spatial and temporal coordinates must be transformed:

:formula_36

Computing length interval formula_37 as well as assuming simultaneous time measurement formula_38, and by plugging in proper length formula_39, it follows:

:formula_40

Equation (2) gives

:formula_41

which, when plugged into (1), demonstrates that formula_42 becomes the contracted length formula_43:

:formula_44.

Likewise, the same method gives a symmetric result for an object at rest in S&#x27;:

:formula_45.

=== Using time dilation ===
Length contraction can also be derived from time dilation, according to which the rate of a single &quot;moving&quot; clock (indicating its proper time formula_3) is lower with respect to two synchronized &quot;resting&quot; clocks (indicating formula_4). Time dilation was experimentally confirmed multiple times, and is represented by the relation:

:formula_48

Suppose a rod of proper length formula_1 at rest in formula_21 and a clock at rest in formula_51 are moving along each other with speed formula_16. Since, according to the principle of relativity, the magnitude of relative velocity is the same in either reference frame, the respective travel times of the clock between the rod&#x27;s endpoints are given by formula_53 in formula_21 and formula_55 in formula_51, thus formula_57 and formula_58. By inserting the time dilation formula, the ratio between those lengths is:

:formula_59.

Therefore, the length measured in formula_51 is given by

:formula_44

So since the clock&#x27;s travel time across the rod is longer in formula_21 than in formula_51 (time dilation in formula_21), the rod&#x27;s length is also longer in formula_21 than in formula_51 (length contraction in formula_51). Likewise, if the clock were at rest in formula_21 and the rod in formula_51, the above procedure would give

:formula_70

=== Geometrical considerations ===

Additional geometrical considerations show that length contraction can be regarded as a &quot;trigonometric&quot; phenomenon, with analogy to parallel slices through a cuboid before and after a &quot;rotation&quot; in E3 (see left half figure at the right). This is the Euclidean analog of &quot;boosting&quot; a cuboid in E1,2. In the latter case, however, we can interpret the boosted cuboid as the &quot;world slab&quot; of a moving plate.

&quot;Image&quot;: Left: a &quot;rotated cuboid&quot; in three-dimensional euclidean space E3. The cross section is &quot;longer&quot; in the direction of the rotation than it was before the rotation. Right: the &quot;world slab&quot; of a moving thin plate in Minkowski spacetime (with one spatial dimension suppressed) E1,2, which is a &quot;boosted cuboid&quot;. The cross section is &quot;thinner&quot; in the direction of the boost than it was before the boost. In both cases, the transverse directions are unaffected and the three planes meeting at each corner of the cuboids are &quot;mutually orthogonal&quot; (in the sense of E1,2 at right, and in the sense of E3 at left).

In special relativity, Poincaré transformations are a class of affine transformations which can be characterized as the transformations between alternative Cartesian coordinate charts on Minkowski spacetime corresponding to alternative states of inertial motion (and different choices of an origin). Lorentz transformations are Poincaré transformations which are linear transformations (preserve the origin). Lorentz transformations play the same role in Minkowski geometry (the Lorentz group forms the &quot;isotropy group&quot; of the self-isometries of the spacetime) which are played by rotations in euclidean geometry. Indeed, special relativity largely comes down to studying a kind of noneuclidean trigonometry in Minkowski spacetime, as suggested by the following table:

<doc id="339028" wikidata="Q653096" url="?curid=339028" title="Boot (torture)">
<text>The term boot refers to a family of instruments of torture and interrogation variously designed to cause crushing injuries to the foot and/or leg. The boot has taken many forms in various places and times. Common varieties include the Spanish boot (sometimes referred to as &quot;scarpines&quot;) and the Malay boot. One type was made of four pieces of narrow wooden board nailed together. The boards were measured to fit the victim&#x27;s leg. Once the leg was enclosed, wedges would be hammered between the boards, creating pressure. The pressure would be increased until the victim confessed or lost consciousness.

Squeezing the foot is one of the most widespread and ancient techniques of torture. The feet and, particularly, the toes, are extremely sensitive to pain and are remote from the brain and vital organs. This enables the torture to be continued hour after hour without endangering the prisoner&#x27;s life.

==Spanish boot==
The Spanish boot was an iron casing for the leg and foot. Wood or iron wedges were hammered in between the casing and the victim&#x27;s flesh. A similar device, commonly referred to as a shin crusher, squeezed the calf between two curved iron plates, studded with spikes, teeth, and knobs, to fracture the tibia and fibula.

Primitive forerunners of the archetype can be found dating back as far as a thousand years. The first Scottish effort, also referred to as a buskin, made use of a vaguely boot-shaped rawhide garment that was soaked with water, drawn over the foot and lower leg, and bound in place with cords. The contraption was slowly heated over a gentle fire, drastically contracting the rawhide and squeezing the foot until the bones were dislocated, though there would not have been sufficient pressure to actually crush the bones of the foot. A more progressive variant, found in both the British Isles and France, consisted of a trio of upright wooden boards that splinted around and between the feet, fundamentally identical to the Chinese foot torture known as &quot;Jiagun&quot;, and were tied in place by cords. Wedges were hammered between the boards and the feet to dislocate and crush the bones. Even ancient India saw the use of the &quot;kittee&quot;, a simple wooden machine, resembling a lemon press, within which the bare foot was slowly squeezed. A prototype hailing from Autun, France, consisted of high boots of spongy, porous leather that were drawn over the feet and legs. Boiling water was poured over the boots, eventually soaking through the leather and eating the flesh away from the entrapped limbs. Lastly, oversized boots of iron or copper (often soldered in place on the floor) received the prisoner&#x27;s bare feet as he lay helplessly bound and gagged in a chair. The boots were slowly filled with boiling water or oil, or even molten lead, to consume the feet and legs. One variant—applied in Ireland to the martyr Dermot O&#x27;Hurley—consisted of lightweight metal boots that were filled with cool water and heated with the feet inside over a fire until the water boiled aggressively.

==Foot press==
A similar implement, the &quot;foot press&quot;, consisted of a pair of horizontal iron plates slowly tightened around the bare foot by means of a crank mechanism, squeezing the foot with sufficient force to pulverize the bones. Although it was quite standard to line the lower plate with ribs to prevent the foot from popping out of the grip of the instrument as it became sweatier, a crueler variant of this device—typically encountered in Nuremberg, Germany—lined the upper plate with hundreds of sharp spikes. A version from Venice, sometimes called the &quot;foot screw&quot; or &quot;toe breaker&quot;, connected the crank mechanism to a drill that slowly mutilated the foot by boring a hole through the center of the instep as the press was tightened. Further, a spike might be positioned over the big toe, which punctured the nail and savagely tortured the sensitive nail bed as the press was tightened. The &quot;toe breaker&quot; from Nuremberg was a wider instrument that accommodated both feet, side by side, simultaneously applying inexorable crushing pressure to all ten toes. Were the prisoner particularly stubborn or strong-willed, the press could be tightened until the plates met, so grinding the foot bones to powder.

In &quot;The Big Book of Pain&quot;, Donnelly and Diehl present an ingenious and diabolical iron torture boot. The configurable device completely encloses the naked foot. The roomy toe box is filled with iron spikes, teeth, and burs. A vertical plate behind the prisoner&#x27;s heel fits into a grooved track and can be forced forward by turning a wheel. The steadily increasing pressure first forces the toes against the spikes, mangling their flesh and crushing their bones. Under continued inexorable pressure, the bones of the instep eventually give way until the arch of the foot is shattered. The heel bone is sufficiently powerful to withstand the torture, although the heel is not generously provided with afferent pain nociceptors. Another variation occasionally seen (Scott, 1991) is a compartment beneath the sole of the prisoner&#x27;s foot that can be filled with red-hot coals.

<doc id="339032" wikidata="Q200314" url="?curid=339032" title="Democratic Party of Japan">
<text>The was a centrist to centre-left, liberal or social-liberal political party in Japan from 1998 to 2016.

The party&#x27;s origins lie in the previous Democratic Party of Japan, which was founded in September 1996 by politicians of the centre-right and centre-left with roots in the Liberal Democratic Party and Japan Socialist Party. In April 1998, the previous DPJ merged with splinters of the New Frontier Party to create a new party which retained the DPJ name. In 2003, the party was joined by the Liberal Party of Ichirō Ozawa.

Following the 2009 election, the DPJ became the ruling party in the House of Representatives, defeating the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and gaining the largest number of seats in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The DPJ was ousted from government by the LDP in the 2012 general election. It retained 57 seats in the lower house, and still had 88 seats in the upper house. During its time in office, the DPJ was beset by internal conflicts and struggled to implement many of its proposed policies, an outcome described by political scientists Phillip Lipscy and Ethan Scheiner as the &quot;paradox of political change without policy change&quot;. Legislative productivity under the DPJ was particularly low, falling to levels unprecedented in recent Japanese history according to some measures. However, the DPJ implemented a number of progressive measures during its time in office such as the provision of free public schooling through high school, increases in child-rearing subsidies, expanded unemployment insurance coverage, extended duration of a housing allowance, and stricter regulations safeguarding part-time and temporary workers.

On 27 March 2016, the DPJ merged with the Japan Innovation Party and Vision of Reform to form the Democratic Party (&quot;Minshintō&quot;), which in turn merged with the Party of Hope to form the Democratic Party for the People.

It is not to be confused with the now-defunct Japan Democratic Party that merged with the Liberal Party in 1955 to form the Liberal Democratic Party. It is also different from another Democratic Party, which was established in 1947 and dissolved in 1950.

==History==
===Beginnings===

The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) was formed on 27 April 1998. It was a merger of four previously independent parties that were opposed to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)—the previous Democratic Party of Japan, the Good Governance Party (民政党, &quot;Minseitō&quot;), the New Fraternity Party (新党友愛, &quot;Shintō-Yūai&quot;), and the Democratic Reform Party (民主改革連合, &quot;Minshu-Kaikaku-Rengō&quot;). The previous parties ranged in ideology from conservative to social-democratic. The new party began with ninety-three members of the House of Representatives and thirty-eight members of the House of Councilors. Moreover, the party officials were elected as well at the party convention for the first time; Naoto Kan, former Health and Welfare Minister was appointed as the president of the party and Tsutomu Hata, former prime minister as secretary-general.

On 24 September 2003 the party formally merged with the small, centre-right Liberal Party led by Ichirō Ozawa in a move largely considered in preparation for the 2003 general election held on 9 November 2003. This move immediately gave the DPJ eight more seats in the House of Councilors.

In the 2003 general election, the DPJ gained a total of 178 seats. This was short of their objectives, but nevertheless a significant demonstration of the new group&#x27;s strength. Following a pension scandal, Naoto Kan resigned and was replaced with moderate liberal Katsuya Okada.

In the 2004 House of Councilors elections, the DPJ won a seat more than the ruling Liberal Democrats, but the LDP still maintained its firm majority in total votes. This was the first time since its inception that the LDP had garnered fewer votes than another party.

The 2005 snap parliamentary elections called by Junichiro Koizumi in response to the rejection of his Postal privatization bills saw a major setback to the DPJ&#x27;s plans of obtaining a majority in the Diet. The DPJ leadership, particularly Okada, had staked their reputation on winning the election and driving the LDP from power. When the final results were in, the DPJ had lost 62 seats, mostly to its rival the LDP. Okada resigned the party leadership, fulfilling his campaign promise to do so if the DPJ did not obtain a majority in the Diet. He was replaced by Seiji Maehara in September 2005.

However, Maehara&#x27;s term as party leader lasted barely half a year. Although he initially led the party&#x27;s criticism of the Koizumi administration, particularly in regards to connections between LDP lawmakers and scandal-ridden Livedoor, the revelation that a fake email was used to try and establish this link greatly damaged his credibility. The scandal led to the resignation of Representative Hisayasu Nagata and of Maehara as party leader on 31 March. New elections for party leader were held on 7 April, in which Ichirō Ozawa was elected president. In the Upper House election 2007, the DPJ won 60 out of 121 contested seats, with 49 seats not up for re-election.

===2009–2012 government===

Ozawa resigned as party leader in May 2009 after a fundraising scandal and Yukio Hatoyama succeeded Ozawa before the August 2009 general election, at which the party swept the LDP from power in a massive landslide, winning 308 seats (out of a total of 480 seats), reducing the LDP from 300 to 119 seats – the worst defeat for a sitting government in modern Japanese history. This was in marked contrast to the closely contested 1993 general election, the only other time the LDP has lost an election. The DPJ&#x27;s strong majority in the House of Representatives assured that Hatoyama would be the next prime minister to replace Tarō Asō, leader of the LDP. Hatoyama was nominated on September 16 and formally appointed later that day by Emperor Akihito in the Tokyo Imperial Palace and formed his Cabinet.

However, the DPJ did not have a majority in the House of Councillors, which was not contested at the election, and fell just short of the 320 seats (a two-thirds majority) needed to override the upper chamber&#x27;s veto power. Hatoyama was thus forced to form a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s New Party to ensure their support in the House of Councillors.

On 2 June 2010, Hatoyama announced his resignation before a party meeting and officially resigned two days later. He cited breaking a campaign promise to close an American military base on the island of Okinawa Prefecture as the main reason for the move. On 28 May 2010, soon after and because of increased tensions after the possible sinking of a Korean ship by North Korea, Hatoyama had made a deal with U.S. President Barack Obama to retain the base for security reasons, but the deal was unpopular in Japan. He also mentioned money scandals involving a top party leader, Ozawa, who resigned as well, in his decision to step down. Hatoyama had been pressured to leave by members of his party after doing poorly in polls in anticipation of the July upper house election. Naoto Kan succeeded Hatoyama as the next President of DPJ and Prime Minister of Japan.

At the July 2010 House of Councillors election, the DPJ lost ten seats and their coalition majority. Prior to the election Kan raised the issue of an increase to Japan&#x27;s 5 per cent consumption tax in order to address the country&#x27;s rising debt. This proposal, together with Ozawa and Hatoyama&#x27;s scandals, was viewed as one of the causes for the party&#x27;s poor performance in the election. The divided house meant the government required the cooperation of smaller parties including Your Party and the Communist Party to ensure the passage of legislation through the upper house.

Ozawa challenged Kan&#x27;s leadership of the DPJ in September 2010. Although Ozawa initially had a slight edge among DPJ members of parliament, local rank-and-file party members and activists overwhelmingly supported Kan, and according to opinion polls the wider Japanese public preferred Kan to Ozawa by as much as a 4–1 ratio. In the final vote by DPJ lawmakers Kan won with 206 votes to Ozawa&#x27;s 200.

After the leadership challenge, Kan reshuffled his cabinet and removed many prominent members of the pro-Ozawa faction from important posts in the new cabinet. The cabinet reshuffle also resulted in the promotion of long-time Kan ally Yoshito Sengoku to Chief Cabinet Secretary, who the LDP labeled as the &quot;second&quot; Prime Minister of the Kan cabinet.

In September 2010, the government intervened to weaken the surging yen by buying U.S. dollars, a move which temporarily relieved Japan&#x27;s exporters. The move proved popular with stock brokers, Japanese exporters, and the Japanese public. It was the first such move by a Japanese government since 2004. Later, in October, after the yen had offset the intervention and had reached a 15-year high, the Kan cabinet approved a stimulus package worth about 5.1 trillion yen ($62 billion) in order to weaken the yen and fight deflation.

===2012–2016 return to opposition and dissolution===
On 24 February 2016, the DPJ announced an agreement to merge with the smaller Japan Innovation Party (JIP) and Vision of Reform ahead of the Upper House elections in the summer, with a merger at a special convention agreed for 27 March. On 4 March 2016, the DPJ and JIP asked supporters for suggestions for a name for the new party. On 14 March 2016 the name of the new party was announced as &quot;Minshintō&quot;, having been the most popular choice of possible names polled among voters. With the addition of Representatives form Vision of Reform, the DPJ and JIP merged to form the Democratic Party on 27 March 2016.

The dissolution of the DPJ is mainly attributed to the fact that the reforms that the DPJ advocated for were hard to put into place because of electoral restrictions, economic restrictions, and the fact that the reforms that would reduce the power of the bureaucracy would help deprive the DPJ of the power to implement their other reforms. Other factors that affected the dissolution of the party were the internal conflicts that paralyzed the DPJ and the fact that the DPJ aligned itself with the foreign policy of the LDP.

==Ideology==
The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) called their philosophy , which was determined in the first party convention on 27 April 1998. DPJ is generally classified as a centrist party, but it is also classified as a centre-left in the context of Japanese politics in contrast to the LDP.

The DPJ aimed to create a platform broad enough to encompass the views of politicians who had roots in either the Liberal Democratic Party or Japan Socialist Party. Party leader Naoto Kan compared the DPJ to the Olive Tree alliance of former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and described his view that it needed to be &quot;the party of Thatcher and Blair&quot;. The DPJ had both conservative and social-democratic elements. Because of this position, the DPJ has often been designated as a big tent party.

===View of the status quo===
The DPJ claimed themselves to be revolutionary in that they are against the status quo and the current governing establishment. The DPJ argued that the bureaucracy and the size of the Japanese government is too large, inefficient, and saturated with cronies and that the Japanese state is too conservative and inflexible. The DPJ wanted to &quot;overthrow the ancient régime locked in old thinking and vested interests, solve the problems at hand, and create a new, flexible, affluent society which values people&#x27;s individuality and vitality.&quot;

===Political standpoint===
===Goals===
Democratic Centrism pursued the following five goals.
* Transparent, just and fair society
:: The Democratic Party sought to build a society governed with rules which are transparent, and fair.
* Free market and inclusive society
:: While the party argued that the free market system should &quot;permeate&quot; economic life, they also aim for an inclusive society which guarantees security, safety, and fair and equal opportunity for each individual.
* Decentralized and participatory society
::The party intended to devolve the centralized government powers to citizens, markets, and local governments so that people of all backgrounds can participate in decision-making.
* Compliance with the three constitutional principles
:: The Democratic Party proclaimed to hold the values in the meaning of the constitution to &quot;embody the fundamental principles of the Constitution&quot;: popular sovereignty, respect for fundamental human rights, and pacifism.
* International relations based on self-reliance and mutual coexistence
:: As a member of the global community, the party sought to establish Japan&#x27;s international relations in the &quot;fraternal spirit&quot; of self-reliance and mutual coexistence to restore the world&#x27;s trust in the country.

===Policy platforms===
The DPJ&#x27;s policy platforms included the restructuring of civil service, monthly allowance to a family with children (¥26,000 per child), cut in gas tax, income support for farmers, free tuition for public high schools, banning of temporary work in manufacturing, raising the minimum-wage to ¥1,000 and halting of increase in sales tax for the next four years.

The DPJ&#x27;s stance on nuclear power was that steady steps should be taken towards nuclear power, but not too quickly as to possibly endanger safety.

<text>St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney, is an Anglican church located in Stepney High Street, Stepney, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The church is believed to have been founded, or re-founded, in AD 952 by St Dunstan, the patron saint of bell ringers, metalworkers and Stepney.

The church is also known as the &quot;Mother Church of the East End&quot;, and the &quot;Church of the High Seas&quot;.

==History==
In about AD 952, Dunstan, the Bishop of London — who was also Lord of the manor of Stepney — replaced the existing wooden structure with a new church (probably including stone elements) dedicated to All the Saints. In 1029, when Dunstan was canonised, the church was rededicated to St Dunstan and All Saints, a dedication it has retained. Like many subsequent Bishops, Dunstan may have lived in the Manor of Stepney, perhaps at the Bishops Wood residence. Dunstan is the patron saint of bellringers, metalworkers, musicians and Stepney; and his feast day is May 19th.

Dunstan is likely to have had a very &#x27;hands on&#x27; approach to building the church. There are so many legends regarding Dunstan, such as those relating to iron in folklore, that some historic accounts are disregarded as ahistorical; such as those describing Dunstan physically moving a whole church so that it better aligns with the traditional East-West axis.

Dunstan is recorded as doing this at Mayfield in the East Sussex Weald, and there is every chance he did similar at Stepney. This is entirely plausible as 10th century churches were typically formed from a small lightweight timber frame that was placed in a pre-dug trench. It is realistic that Dunstan, especially if aided by local builders, adjusted the alignment of the church structure within the trenches with his shoulder. Once the structure was correctly aligned, the trench could be filled in and the gaps in the timber framework filled with wattle and daub.

The church is known as &quot;The Mother Church of the East End&quot; as the parish covered most of what would become inner East London, before population growth led to the creation of a large number of daughter parishes. This fission started in the fourteenth century or before. Some of the earliest other churches built in the parish were Whitechapel and Bow; the former became an independent parish at an early date, while the latter was long a chapel of ease.

The existing building is the third on the site and was built of Kentish ragstone mainly in the fifteenth century (although the chancel dates from 200 years earlier). A porch and octagonal parish room were added in 1872 by Arthur Shean Newman and Arthur Billing. The church was restored extensively in 1899 by Cutts and Cutts, at a cost of £5,600. The vestries and some of the main building were destroyed by fire on 12 October 1901, including the organ which had carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The restoration (again by Cutts and Cutts) cost £7,084, and the church was re-opened in June 1902 by the Bishop of Stepney (at that time Cosmo Gordon Lang). There was war-time damage, which was restored by Cyril Wontner-Smith. The church is Grade I listed

===Bells===
A ring of ten bells, tuned to C#, hangs in the belfry. The bells were cast at the local Whitechapel Bell Foundry founded in 1570. Until its closure in 2017, the foundry was the last major survivor of an East End metalworking heritage going back to at least the 1300’s, and whose largest expression was the nearby Thames Ironworks at Blackwall and Canning Town.

Of the ten, the seven oldest bells of these were cast in 1806. The bells were re-hung in 1899. The heaviest bell weighs 28¾ hundredweight. Three were recast in 1952 when repairs were made to the tower. The bells are mentioned in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;: &quot;When will that be, say the bells of Stepney.&quot;

===Interior===
A fine triple sedilia (priests&#x27; stone seating) is found in the chancel. The rood is late Anglo Saxon. Of note amongst the plate is a cup and paten dated 1559 and a beadle&#x27;s staff and verger&#x27;s wand of 1752.

The organ was installed in 1971 by Noel Mander of Mander Organs. It is an 1872 Father Willis instrument built for St Augustine&#x27;s, Haggerston, and rebuilt by R. Spurden Rutt &amp; Co in 1926. It replaced a 1903 Norman and Beard organ, which is now located at St Edmund the King, Northwood Hills. In turn, that organ replaced the one destroyed in the 1901 fire, which was from 1678 and built by Renatus Harris, and had been rebuilt by Lewis &amp; Co in 1900.

===Churchyard===
The church is surrounded by a churchyard of nearly seven acres (28,000 m2). Around 1665, the churchyard was enlarged to cope with the massive number of deaths during the Great Plague of London. In one eighteen-month period 6,583 died, with 154 being buried in one day in September 1665.

The church has a long, traditional link with the sea and many sailors were buried here. It was once known as the &#x27;Church of the High Seas&#x27;. The graveyard is also where Roger Crab, the 17th-century hermit who lived on a diet solely of herbs, roots, leaves, grass and water, is buried.

The churchyard closed to burials in 1854. Between 1885 and 1887 high ground around the church was dug away, and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association converted it to a public garden, designed by the MPGA&#x27;s landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson. The MPGA bore the cost of conversion at £3,000. The garden was opened by the Duchess of Leeds in 1887.

The railings, piers and gates to the churchyard are Grade II listed; the war memorial in the churchyard is also separately Grade II listed.

===Current activities===
The church continues to be open to visitors and worshippers from all over the world. There is an active congregation who help to continue the life of the church community. As well as the Arbour Centre (a St Dunstan&#x27;s community project) and the food bank, there is a close connection with two schools: Stepney Greencoat Church of England Primary School and Stepney All Saints School. St Dunstan&#x27;s also employs a Children and Community Worker funded by the Bishop of London&#x27;s Mission Fund.

<text>In personal computer microprocessor architecture, a back-side bus (BSB), or backside bus, was a computer bus used on early Intel platforms to connect the CPU to CPU cache memory, usually off-die L2. If a design utilizes a back-side bus along with a front-side bus (FSB), the design is said to use a dual-bus architecture, or in Intel&#x27;s terminology &quot;Dual Independent Bus&quot; (DIB) architecture. The back-side bus architecture evolved when newer processors like the second-generation Pentium III began to incorporate on-die L2 cache, which at the time was advertised as &quot;Advanced Transfer Cache&quot;, but Intel continued to refer to the Dual Independent Bus till the end of Pentium III.

==History==

BSB is an improvement over the older practice of using a single system bus, because a single bus typically became a severe bottleneck as CPUs and memory speeds increased. Due to its dedicated nature, the back-side bus can be optimized for communication with cache, thus eliminating protocol overheads and additional signals that are required on a general-purpose bus. Furthermore, since a BSB operates over a shorter distance, it can typically operate at higher clock speeds, increasing the computer&#x27;s overall performance.

Cache connected with a BSB was initially external to the microprocessor die, but now is usually on-die. In the latter case, the BSB clock frequency is typically equal to the processor&#x27;s, and the back-side bus can also be made much wider (256-bit, 512-bit) than either off-chip or on-chip FSB.

The dual-bus architecture was used in a number of designs, including the IBM and Freescale (formerly the semiconductor division of Motorola) PowerPC processors (certain PowerPC 604 models, the PowerPC 7xx family, and the Freescale 7xxx line), as well as the Intel Pentium Pro, Pentium II and early Pentium III processors, 
which used it to access their L2 cache (earlier Intel processors accessed the L2 cache over the FSB, while later processors moved it on-chip).

<text>Willard Gordon Galen Weston (October 29, 1940April 12, 2021) was a British-Canadian billionaire businessman and Chairman Emeritus of George Weston Limited, a Canadian food processing and distribution company. Weston and his family, with an estimated net worth of US$8.7 billion, are listed as the third wealthiest in Canada and 178th in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine (June 2019).

In addition to being one of the country&#x27;s leading bakers through wholly owned subsidiary Weston Foods, he was an experienced supermarket retailer who maintained a controlling interest in Loblaw Companies, Canada&#x27;s largest food retailer, through a family holding company. Weston was also head of the world&#x27;s second-largest luxury goods retailer as chairman of Holt Renfrew in Canada and the Selfridges Group, owner of Selfridges in the United Kingdom, Brown Thomas in Ireland, the De Bijenkorf department store chain in the Netherlands, and the recently acquired Ogilvy department store in Montreal. Weston was chairman of The W. Garfield Weston Foundation, a Canadian charitable foundation that has made close to $200 million in donations over the past decade.

== Early years ==
Weston was born to Reta Lila (Howard) and W. Garfield Weston at Marlow in Buckinghamshire, approximately west of London, on October 29, 1940 – the youngest of nine children. Garfield Weston, a Canadian businessman whose father George Weston established George Weston Limited, had successfully expanded overseas during the 1930s by acquiring and modernising biscuit and bread factories throughout the United Kingdom. In 1945, Weston and his family returned to Canada but moved frequently as his father pursued various business ventures, which included supermarket chains in North America and Europe. Growing up, Weston worked in the stores that comprised his father&#x27;s retail holdings. He once noted, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a bag boy a thousand times in five languages.&quot; Between 1954 and 1959, he was educated in the United Kingdom at the elite London school, St Paul&#x27;s.

== Ireland ==
In 1962, after briefly studying business administration at Huron University College at the University of Western Ontario, Weston moved to Dublin to set up a grocery store. A second location followed, and the outlets evolved into the Powers chain of supermarkets. Weston found the Republic of Ireland a land of opportunity:

Southern Ireland in the early Sixties, in terms of growth, was where the real opportunities existed. The population was coming to Dublin, the European Community was becoming more and more aware of Ireland. Lemass was beginning to take a different perspective upon capital coming into the country and it looked like there was going to be a major opportunity for growth.
By 1965, Weston&#x27;s business had grown to six grocery stores. Four years later, he expanded his business interests with the purchase of a bankrupt department store called Todd Burns, which he renamed Penneys (now known as Primark outside of Ireland). Within a year, four more stores opened, all with a similar discount format. Two years later, the first Penneys outside of Dublin was launched, followed by eleven more stores, including one in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Weston married Hilary Frayne, one of Ireland&#x27;s top fashion models, in 1966.

In the early 1970s, Weston expanded his grocery holdings with the acquisition of competitor Quinnsworth. In 1971, Weston purchased an interest in Brown Thomas, the upscale Dublin department store, and gave it to his wife as a present. They eventually acquired full ownership in 1984.

== Loblaw ==
In 1971, Weston was asked by Garfield Weston, Chairman of George Weston Limited, to take a look at Loblaws, the company&#x27;s Ontario-based supermarket chain, which appeared headed for bankruptcy. He found a company deeply in debt with too many small, aging outlets, and a market share recently cut in half. &quot;The big question then was should this chain be closed up or should we make the enormous investment in money and time to return it to its former place. I felt that from a retailing standpoint Loblaws was the nucleus of potentially the finest company in Canada.&quot;

In February 1972, Weston was appointed chief executive officer of Loblaw Companies and immediately began consolidating operations. Financing was arranged through a Weston family holding company to free Loblaws from store leaseback agreements. Within a year, 78 money-losing locations were closed down. Weston noted that, &quot;as a 200-store chain, we didn&#x27;t look very good. As a 100-store chain, we looked very good indeed.&quot;

Weston next hired designer Don Watt to remodel one of the chain&#x27;s Toronto outlets on a budget of only $30,000. &quot;Loblaws is in such trouble that if it doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t matter. If it works – good.&quot; The new store featured an expanded produce section moved upfront with huge photographs of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and baked goods. It used panelling and big moveable display bins, in addition to new colours and logo. Sales dramatically increased. Loblaws also introduced a new advertising campaign, featuring Canadian actor William Shatner of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame who told viewers, &quot;More than the price is right at Loblaws ... but by gosh the price is right.&quot;

Weston also brought in new managerial talent that included former university schoolmate Dave Nichol and fellow McKinsey consultant Richard Currie, who took on the role of &quot;change agents&quot;. In spite of no previous experience in the retail food industry, Weston gave Nichol and Currie the authority to force change on an often reluctant senior management. Nichol was made President of Loblaws in Ontario and later Loblaw International Merchants. He became closely associated with the company&#x27;s first in-house brand No Name in 1978 and was behind the introduction of the President&#x27;s Choice brand in 1983. Currie&#x27;s knowledge of logistics led to him being appointed President of Loblaw Companies Limited and, years later, George Weston Limited.

With the company&#x27;s holdings in the United States also losing money, particularly Chicago, Illinois-based National Tea with some 700 supermarkets, Weston initiated a similar program of rationalization and renewal. He and Currie rented a townhouse in a Chicago suburb and spent months devising a plan that saw hundreds of outlets closed. Those stores that remained were renovated and rebranded in the hope of preserving the company&#x27;s stake in the U.S. market. Weston noted, &quot;it was in the cards that National Tea should be, or would be, disposed of. But I felt we had a tremendous foothold in the U.S. and it must not be lost, almost at any price.&quot;

=== Private labels ===
In addition to investing in store renovations, early on Weston earmarked $40 million for the development of private label brands:

&quot;We found it essential to change products and services before redesigning their image. For example, nothing is more disappointing for a consumer than to buy a private label product because of the attractiveness of its redesigned label and then find that the same quality that had disappointed her previously had not been improved.&quot;
In March 1978, Loblaw launched &quot;No Name&quot;, a line of 16 generic products in simple black and yellow packaging with advertised savings of 10 to 40 percent over the national brands. Within weeks, some No Name items had sold out. Months later, the company opened its first No Frills store, featuring No Name, along with a limited selection of 500 items at discount prices. Consumer response was so favourable that it began converting older, more marginal stores to No Frills outlets.

As the product line-up expanded, Loblaw soon began experimenting with a variety of gourmet No Name items. When sales of &quot;President&#x27;s Blend Gourmet Coffee&quot; started outselling every other grocery item on the shelf, the decision was made to introduce a premium line of store brand products. In 1983, &quot;President&#x27;s Choice&quot; was launched, with each item endorsed by Loblaws President Dave Nichol and promoted through the popular advertising supplement &quot;Dave Nichol&#x27;s Insider&#x27;s Report&quot;. No Name and President&#x27;s Choice went on to account for almost a third of grocery item sales at Loblaw.

=== Chairmanship ===
In March 1975, Weston was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of George Weston Limited. As Weston took charge of North American operations, his brother Garry Weston, based in London, England, continued to head Associated British Foods. Although market share in Ontario was regained, the company continued to struggle. In 1976, year-end results showed a loss of $50 million for Loblaw, while parent George Weston Limited lost $14 million – the first recorded loss in the company&#x27;s history. That same year, Loblaw sold three unprofitable divisions - Chicago, Syracuse, and California State – representing 280 stores or half of its remaining U.S. retail outlets.

Within the first few years of Weston&#x27;s chairmanship, $300 million of non-core assets were divested. &quot;The one philosophical change as a result of my involvement with the company was to swing from a commitment to sales growth – almost regardless of geography of industry, sales came first, earnings second – to the question of return on capital employed and productivity in its most sophisticated sense.&quot;

Well into the 1970s, the company continued to sell assets to shore up its balance sheet. In 1978, both Loblaw and George Weston Limited returned to profitability and in 1979 the company showed record earnings of $76 million on sales of $6 billion.

=== Expansion ===
On the retail side, Loblaw expanded through the 1980s when it had become Canada&#x27;s largest and most profitable grocery retailer. Loblaw had begun opening large format, one-stop-shopping centres in Western Canada under the Real Canadian Superstore banner and were successful, but when similar large-scale &#x27;hypermarkets&#x27; were opened in Ontario, they lost money and had to be scaled back. As a result of Loblaw owning much of its real estate, rather than leasing, the company was able to reduce the size of its Supercentres by simply renting out the redundant space.

While retail formats were not easily transferable, the company&#x27;s &#x27;control label&#x27; products proved successful from one store format and part of the country to another. By the 1990s, No Name and President&#x27;s Choice products accounted for $1.5 billion in revenue with sales that extended into the United States.

=== Free trade ===
While Weston expressed personal support for free trade with the United States, the signing of an agreement in 1988 resulted in another re-evaluation of his company&#x27;s asset mix. Through the late 1980s and 1990s, businesses that included biscuit and ice cream making, bathroom tissue manufacturing, milling, sugar refining and chocolate bar makings, were divested as domestic industries struggled to remain competitive:
&quot;The historic east-west dynamics of the Canadian economy, as well as our small and scattered population, created structural inefficiencies in everything we did. And so, in response to free trade, we had to become competitive on our manufacturing side, which meant staying with fewer product categories and only those that could succeed on the North American scale. We restructured, we consolidated, and we did what had to be done for our long-term survival.&quot;
=== Divestiture and growth ===
In 1995, Loblaw divested the last of its retail holding in the United States while Weston oversaw the expansion of Canadian retail operations. Loblaw bought 80-store Agora Foods of Atlantic Canada for $81 million in late 1998 and soon thereafter announced the purchase of Quebec-based Provigo for $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, George Weston Limited continued to move away from resource-based industries. In 1998 the company E.B. Eddy Forest Products was divested for $800 million. East and West coast fish processing operations, namely British Columbia Packers and Connors Brothers of New Brunswick, were merged and sold.

Weston greatly expanded the company&#x27;s American bakery operations with the purchase of Bestfoods Baking Co. from Unilever for (U.S.) $1.7 billion in 2001. With nineteen plants, Weston acquired brands that included Entenmann&#x27;s and Thomas&#x27; English Muffins.

=== Retrenchment ===
In 2006, Loblaw recorded its first loss in almost two decades as a program to centralize administrative functions and consolidate warehouse operations resulted in chronic supply chains problems and customer complaints of empty shelves. In September, Loblaw President John Lederer and Chairman Weston resigned. Galen G. Weston, Weston&#x27;s son, became the new Executive Chairman with Allen Leighton appointed Deputy Chairman and later President. Weston retained the post of Chairman and President of parent George Weston Limited. With the introduction of a &quot;fix the basics&quot; program, designed to re-focus on food retailing, and a drive to resolve logistical problems, Loblaw returned to profitability in 2007.

In 2008, several major assets were sold, namely Neilson Dairy to Saputo for (CAN) $465 million and George Weston Bakeries and Stroehmann Bakeries in the United States to Mexican conglomerate Grupo Bimbo for (US) $2.5 billion. Weston noted the sale of the American assets represented the company&#x27;s biggest deal ever and that these transactions left Weston and Loblaw with a combined $5 billion in cash to use for future acquisitions. In 2009, Loblaw acquired T &amp; T Supermarket, a chain of Chinese grocery stores with operations in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.

== Holt Renfrew ==
Although a bid by Weston and George Weston Limited to acquire the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and its chain of department stores failed in 1979, a second opportunity to acquire a major Canadian retailer presented itself several years later. In 1986, Wittington Investments, the Weston family holding company, announced the purchase of Holt Renfrew &amp; Co. Limited. Press reports named a purchase price of $43 million for the fifteen store chain. Holt Renfrew subsequently underwent an extensive renovation program.

== Windsor development in Florida ==
In 1989, Weston and his wife broke ground on the Windsor gated community in Vero Beach, Florida, a private residential development on Florida&#x27;s east coast. Promoted as a &quot;Village by the Sea&quot;, the project combined Weston&#x27;s interest in modern architecture with decades of first-hand experience in commercial planning. The development sits on with 350 residences of Anglo-Caribbean design. It has a full-service equestrian center and an 18-hole golf course.

== Selfridges ==
In 2003, it was announced that Weston had completed a deal to buy Selfridges, the British department store chain, through the Weston family holding company. Press reports quoted a purchase price of £598 million. Plans to expand the number of stores were shelved in favour of extensive renovations to Selfridges&#x27; flagship store, the historic Oxford Street landmark in the heart of London&#x27;s shopping district.

His daughter Alannah Weston (married to the grandson and heir of the late Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Baronet, and his Lebanese wife Lady Cochrane Sursock) was subsequently named creative director at Selfridges. The Selfridges Group has since expanded its holdings with the November 2010 acquisition of luxury department store chain De Bijenkorf of the Netherlands and the July 2011 purchase of the Ogilvy department store in downtown Montreal.

==Personal life==
Weston married Hilary Weston (née Frayne) on July 23, 1966. They had two children, Alannah and Galen Weston Jr., both born in 1972.

When in the United Kingdom, the Westons would reside at Fort Belvedere outside London, while in Canada they reside in central Toronto or on a private island in Georgian Bay, Ontario. They spent their winters either at a gated community in Eleuthera and Harbour Island in the Bahamas or at the Windsor gated community in Vero Beach, Florida.

In August 1983, Weston was the target of an attempted kidnapping by the Irish Republican Army from his estate in Ireland. The police had been tipped off about the attempt and set up an ambush for the kidnappers. Upon the kidnappers arrival, a gun fight broke out and two of the kidnappers were killed and five were arrested.

==Later life and death==
Weston retired in 2016 as chairman of George Weston Limited and was succeeded by his son. He died at his home in Toronto on April 12, 2021, after a long illness.

== Philanthropy ==
Weston was a supporter of a range of charitable causes, both personally and as Chairman of the W. Garfield Weston Foundation. The Foundation assists Canadian students through the Garfield Weston Awards, along with various scholarship programs, and made possible the Weston Family Learning Centre at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Weston Family Innovation Centre at the Ontario Science Centre. The Foundation is a major contributor to the Nature Conservancy of Canada and its work to preserve wilderness lands. It also funds scientific research, especially into Canada&#x27;s ecologically fragile Arctic. It further provides financial support to a variety of social organizations that include food banks and the Salvation Army in Canada. He also served as president of the board of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair and as chairman and chief fundraiser for the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific. In 2004, Weston and the Hon. Hilary M. Weston (26th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario 1997–2002) and Chair of the Renaissance ROM Campaign, donated $10 million to the initiative to revitalize the Royal Ontario Museum – a contribution matched by the W. Garfield Weston Foundation. In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, The Garfield Weston Foundation created an initiative valued at £25 million designed to support mid to large-scale organizations impacted by the virus.

In recognition of his charitable donations, Weston was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990, awarded the Order of Ontario in 2005, and made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 2017.

Weston was also a significant contributor to the Fraser Institute, a conservative think-tank headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, donating over $1 million CDN annually.

<text>Peter Ware Higgs (29 May 1929 – 8 April 2024) was a British theoretical physicist, professor at the University of Edinburgh, and Nobel laureate in Physics for his work on the mass of subatomic particles.

In 1964, Higgs was the single author of one of the three milestone papers published in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; (&quot;PRL&quot;) that proposed that spontaneous symmetry breaking in electroweak theory could explain the origin of mass of elementary particles in general and of the W and Z bosons in particular. This Higgs mechanism predicted the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, the detection of which became one of the great goals of physics. In 2012, CERN announced the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics, without which certain particles would have no mass.

For this work, Higgs received the Nobel Prize in Physics, which he shared with François Englert in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Higgs was born in the Elswick district of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to Thomas Ware Higgs (1898–1962) and his wife Gertrude Maude née Coghill (1895–1969). His father worked as a sound engineer for the BBC, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family moving around because of his father&#x27;s job and later World War II, Higgs missed some early schooling and was taught at home. When his father relocated to Bedford, Higgs stayed behind in Bristol with his mother, and was largely raised there. He attended Cotham Grammar School in Bristol from 1941 to 1946, where he was inspired by the work of one of the school&#x27;s alumni, Paul Dirac, a founder of the field of quantum mechanics.

In 1946, at the age of 17, Higgs moved to City of London School, where he specialised in mathematics, then in 1947 to King&#x27;s College London, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in physics in 1950 and achieved a master&#x27;s degree in 1952. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and performed his doctoral research in molecular physics under the supervision of Charles Coulson and Christopher Longuet-Higgins. He was awarded a PhD degree in 1954 with a thesis entitled &quot;Some problems in the theory of molecular vibrations&quot; from the university.

==Career and research==
After finishing his doctorate, Higgs was appointed a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (1954–56). He then held various posts at Imperial College London, and University College London (where he also became a temporary lecturer in mathematics). He returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1960 to take up the post of Lecturer at the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics, allowing him to settle in the city he had enjoyed while hitchhiking to the Western Highlands as a student in 1949. He was promoted to Reader, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 1974 and was promoted to a personal chair of Theoretical Physics in 1980. On his retirement in 1996, he became an emeritus professor.

Higgs was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983 and Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1991. He was awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize in 1984. He received an honorary degree from the University of Bristol in 1997. In 2008, he received an Honorary Fellowship from Swansea University for his work in particle physics. At Edinburgh, Higgs first became interested in mass, developing the idea that particles – massless when the universe began – acquired mass a fraction of a second later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became known as the Higgs field). Higgs postulated that this field permeates space, giving mass to all elementary subatomic particles interacting with it.

The Higgs mechanism postulates the existence of the Higgs field, which confers mass on quarks and leptons; this causes only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass. The original basis of Higgs&#x27;s work came from the Japanese-born theorist and Nobel Prize laureate Yoichiro Nambu from the University of Chicago. Nambu had proposed a theory known as spontaneous symmetry breaking based on what was known to happen in superconductivity in condensed matter, which incorrectly predicted massless particles (the Goldstone&#x27;s theorem).

Higgs reportedly developed the fundamentals of his theory after returning to his Edinburgh New Town apartment from a failed weekend camping trip to the Highlands. He stated that there was no &quot;eureka moment&quot; in the development of the theory. He wrote a short paper exploiting a loophole in Goldstone&#x27;s theorem (massless Goldstone particles need not occur when local symmetry is spontaneously broken in a relativistic theory) and published it in &quot;Physics Letters&quot;, a European physics journal edited at CERN, in Switzerland, in 1964.

Higgs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (the Higgs mechanism), but the paper was rejected (the editors of &quot;Physics Letters&quot; judged it &quot;of no obvious relevance to physics&quot;). Higgs wrote an extra paragraph and sent his paper to &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, another leading physics journal, which published it later in 1964. This paper predicted a new massive spin-zero boson (later named the Higgs boson).
Other physicists, Robert Brout and François Englert and Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen and Tom Kibble
had reached similar conclusions at about the same time. In the published version, Higgs quotes Brout and Englert, and the third paper quotes the previous ones. The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Brout, and Englert were each recognised as milestone papers by &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; 50th-anniversary celebration. While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy. The mechanism had been proposed in 1962 by Philip Anderson although he did not include a crucial relativistic model.

On 4 July 2012, CERN announced the ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiments had seen strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (GeV).
Speaking at the seminar in Geneva, Higgs commented &quot;It&#x27;s really an incredible thing that it&#x27;s happened in my lifetime.&quot; Ironically, this probable confirmation of the Higgs boson was made at the same place where the editor of &quot;Physics Letters&quot; rejected Higgs&#x27;s paper.

==Awards and honours==
Higgs was honoured with several awards in recognition of his work, including the 1981 Hughes Medal from the Royal Society; the 1984 Rutherford Medal from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize by the European Physical Society; the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics; the 2009 Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; the 2010 American Physical Society J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics; a unique Higgs Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012; and the Royal Society awarded him the 2015 Copley Medal, the world&#x27;s oldest scientific prize.

===Civic awards===

Higgs was the recipient of the Edinburgh Award for 2011. He was the fifth person to receive the Award, which was established in 2007 by the City of Edinburgh Council to honour an outstanding individual who has made a positive impact on the city and gained national and international recognition for Edinburgh.

Higgs was presented with an engraved loving cup by the Rt Hon George Grubb, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in a ceremony held at the City Chambers on Friday, 24 February 2012. The event also marked the unveiling of his handprints in the City Chambers quadrangle, where they had been engraved in Caithness stone alongside those of previous Edinburgh Award recipients.

Higgs was awarded the Freedom of the City of Bristol in July 2013. The Dirac-Higgs Science Centre in Bristol is also named in his honour. In April 2014, he was also awarded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was also honoured with a brass plaque installed on the Newcastle Quayside as part of the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative Local Heroes Walk of Fame.

===Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics===
On 6 July 2012, Edinburgh University announced a new centre named after Professor Higgs to support future research in theoretical physics. The Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics brings together scientists from around the world to seek &quot;a deeper understanding of how the universe works&quot;. The centre is currently based within the James Clerk Maxwell Building, home of the university&#x27;s School of Physics and Astronomy and the iGEM 2015 team (ClassAfiED). The university has also established a chair of theoretical physics in the name of Peter Higgs.

===Nobel Prize in Physics===
On 8 October 2013, it was announced that Higgs and François Englert would share the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider&quot;. Higgs admitted he had gone out to avoid the media attention so he was informed he had been awarded the prize by an ex-neighbour on his way home, since he did not have a mobile phone.

===Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour===
Higgs turned down a knighthood in 1999, but in 2012, he accepted membership of the Order of the Companions of Honour. He later said that he only accepted the order because he was wrongly assured that the award was in the gift of the Queen alone. He also expressed cynicism towards the honours system, and the way the system &quot;is used for political purposes by the government in power&quot;. The order confers no title or precedence, but recipients of the order are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;. &quot;In the same interview he also stated that when people ask what the after his name stands for, he replies &quot;it means I&#x27;m an honorary Swiss.&quot; He received the order from the Queen at an investiture at Holyrood House on 1 July 2014.

A portrait of Higgs was painted by Ken Currie in 2008. Commissioned by the University of Edinburgh, it was unveiled on 3 April 2009 and hangs in the entrance of the James Clerk Maxwell Building of the School of Physics and Astronomy and the School of Mathematics. A large portrait by Lucinda Mackay is in the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Another portrait of Higgs by the same artist hangs in the birthplace of James Clerk Maxwell in Edinburgh; Higgs was the Honorary Patron of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation. A portrait by Victoria Crowe was commissioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh and unveiled in 2013.

==Personal life and political views==
Higgs married Jody Williamson, an American lecturer in linguistics at Edinburgh and a fellow activist with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), in 1963. Their first son was born in August 1965. Higgs had two sons: Christopher and Jonny, a jazz musician. He also had two grandchildren: Jo, a writer, and Bonnie (Kemplay), a musician. Higgs and Williamson separated in 1972 but remained friends until she died in 2008.

Higgs was an activist in the CND while in London and later in Edinburgh but resigned his membership when the group extended its remit from campaigning against nuclear weapons to campaigning against nuclear power, too. He was a Greenpeace member until the group opposed genetically modified organisms. Higgs was awarded the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (sharing it with Robert Brout and François Englert) but declined to attend the awards ceremony in Jerusalem in protest of Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians. Higgs was actively involved in the Edinburgh University branch of the Association of University Teachers, through which he agitated for greater staff involvement in the management of the physics department.

Higgs was an atheist. He described Richard Dawkins as having adopted a &quot;fundamentalist&quot; view of non-atheists. Higgs expressed displeasure with the nickname the &quot;God particle&quot;. Although it has been reported that he believed the term &quot;might offend people who are religious&quot;, Higgs stated that this is not the case, lamenting the letters he has received which claim the God particle was predicted in the Torah, the Qur&#x27;an and Buddhist scriptures. In a 2013 interview with Decca Aitkenhead, Higgs was quoted as saying:

The nickname for the Higgs boson is usually attributed to Leon M. Lederman, the author of the book &quot;The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?&quot; but the name is the result of the suggestion of Lederman&#x27;s publisher; Lederman had initially intended to refer to it as the &quot;goddamn particle&quot;.

== Death ==
Higgs died after a short illness at home in Edinburgh on 8 April 2024, aged 94.

<doc id="339051" wikidata="Q5761100" url="?curid=339051" title="Hilary Weston">
<text>Hilary Mary Weston ( Frayne; born January 12, 1942) is an Irish–Canadian businesswoman and writer who served as the 26th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1997 to 2002. During her five-year tenure, Weston focused on issues related to women, volunteerism and young people, drawing public attention to people working with the homeless, in hospices and as mentors to at-risk youth.

==Life and career==
Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, she was educated at Loreto Abbey, Dalkey. She worked as a model before marrying Galen Weston in 1966. They moved to Toronto in 1974, and she became a Canadian citizen. They have two married children, Alannah and Galen Jr., and five grandchildren – two girls and a boy with Alannah and her husband Alex Cochrane (an interior architect), and two boys with Galen and his wife Alexandra.

Prior to her appointment as Lieutenant Governor, Weston spent over two decades working in business and the fashion industry. As deputy chair of Holt Renfrew, she promoted Canadian design and merchandise. During the same period, she also served as a director of Brown Thomas &amp; Co. in Ireland, co-founded Torwest in the United States, and served as vice-chair and design director of the Windsor Club at the Windsor gated community in Vero Beach, Florida.

In 1979, Weston founded the Ireland Fund of Canada, a non-partisan, non-denominational organization that funds community projects in Ireland to promote peace. She continues to serve as an honorary patron of the organization.

An interest in early childhood education led Weston to serve as founding chair of the Mabin School in Toronto. She also co-founded and chaired the Canadian Environment Educational Foundation, and she established the Winter Garden Show at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Weston has explored her longstanding interest in homes and gardens as co-author of two best-selling books, &quot;In a Canadian Garden&quot; (1989) and &quot;At Home in Canada&quot; (1995).

After her term as Lieutenant Governor, Weston spearheaded the most successful fundraising campaign in Canadian cultural history, which raised more than $250 million for the Royal Ontario Museum. She is patron of several organizations dealing with social issues, such as the Abbeyfield House Society, the Hospice Association of Ontario, the Landmine Survivors Network (later known as Survivor Corps), the Ontario March of Dimes, the Prince&#x27;s Trust Canada and the Yonge Street Mission. Weston also devotes a significant proportion of her time, as well as her business and fashion expertise, to Selfridges, the London department store of which she is a director.

==Honours==
As Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Weston received the Order of Ontario in 1997, and she served as chancellor of the order during her term in office. She was also invested as a Dame of Justice in the Venerable Order of St. John in 1997. Weston was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2003. She received the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. In the 2015 Birthday Honours, she was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

Ten post-secondary institutions have recognized Weston with honorary degrees, including the University of Western Ontario, University of St. Michael&#x27;s College, University of Toronto, Massey College, Trinity College, Dublin and University College Dublin

In 2009, Weston received the President&#x27;s Award at the YWCA Toronto &quot;Women of Distinction Awards&quot;, for modeling leadership in public and private life.

<doc id="339053" wikidata="Q77406" url="?curid=339053" title="Arnold Janssen">
<text>Arnold Janssen (5 November 1837 – 15 January 1909), was a German-Dutch Catholic priest and missionary who is venerated as a saint. He founded the Society of the Divine Word, a Catholic missionary religious congregation, also known as the &quot;Divine Word Missionaries&quot;, as well as two congregations for women. In 1889 he founded in Steyl, Netherlands, the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit and in 1896 at the same place the Holy Spirit Adoration Sisters. He was canonized on 5 October 2003, by Pope John Paul II.

== Life and work ==
Janssen was born 5 November 1837 in Goch in the Rhineland, Germany, not far from the Dutch border, one of eleven siblings. He developed a deep, simple faith. His first school was the Catholic Augustinianum High School in Gaesdonck, which is near his birthplace. He took up the study of philosophy at the Academy of Muenster, and then entered the University of Bonn. As a student in the university, Janssen entered a mathematics contest; he used the prize money to treat his father to a trip to the university and down the Rhine River; (his mother was too ill to make the trip).

Janssen was ordained to the priesthood for the diocese of Muenster on 15 August 1861. For a while he worked as a high school teacher in Bocholt, Germany, teaching physics and catechism. He devoted some years to pastoral work and the teaching of Christian doctrine, in 1873 becoming chaplain and director at the Ursuline convent of Kempen. In 1867 he became the diocesan director of the Apostleship of Prayer. This led to the founding in 1874 of the German-language journal &quot;Kleiner Herz-Jesu Bote&quot; (Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart), which looked to enlist the faithful in prayer and support for the mission.

The Kulturkampf, however, hampered his efforts, and Janssen purchased land in Steyl, the Netherlands, to begin his seminary, dedicated in 1875 as the &quot;St. Michael the Archangel Mission House&quot;. Within a few years, many seminarians, priests and brothers were preparing there for missionary service, and the first two missionaries, Joseph Freinademetz and John Anzer, were sent to Hong Kong at the request of Bishop Giovanni T. Raimondi. The Society of the Divine Word received canonical approbation in 1901.

From the very beginning, a group of women, including Maria Helena Stollenwerk, served the community. Janssen also founded two congregations of religious sisters: The Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters (members known as &quot;Sister Servants of the Holy Spirit&quot;) on 8 December 1889, and the Holy Spirit Adoration Sisters (&quot;Sister Servants of the Holy Spirit of Perpetual Adoration&quot;) on 8 September 1896.

Arnold Janssen died at Steyl, Holland, on January 15, 1909.

==Veneration==
Janssen&#x27;s spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 23 November 1939 and 13 February 1942. His cause was formally opened on 10 July 1942, and he was declared a Servant of God.

Janssen and Joseph Freinademetz, along with Daniele Comboni (an important missionary in Africa) were canonised on 5 October 2003 by Pope John Paul II. Janssen was elevated to sainthood after the healing of Pamela Avellanosa, a Filipina teenager living in Baguio who fell from a bike and was not expected to recover from the resulting head injury. According to her relatives and the Catholic Church, she was healed miraculously following prayers to Janssen.

In his hometown of Goch, the Arnold-Janssen-Church and the Arnold-Janssen-Community are named after Janssen. His birthplace can be visited in the Arnold-Janssen-Street.

The St. Arnold neighborhood in Neuenkirchen, Westphalia, has an Arnold-Janssen High School. It was founded 1929 by his religious community, but since 1996 it has been administered by the Diocese of Münster. The Arnold-Janssen High School in Sankt Wendel, Saarland, is also named for him, as is the Arnold-Janssen-Hauptschule in Bocholt.

He was educated at Hertford Grammar School (now Richard Hale School) and Trinity College, Cambridge (MA), where he read history before pursuing religious studies at Cuddesdon and Lincoln Theological Colleges.

He has spoken of his great-uncle, John Chartres, &quot;called [the] &#x27;Mystery Man of the Treaty&#x27; was a member of Sinn Féin and a Protestant civil servant. He was also undoubtedly a gun runner for Michael Collins&quot;.

===Early ordained ministry===
Chartres was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1973 and as a priest in 1974. He served his curacy at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bedford in the Diocese of St Albans. In 1975, he became domestic chaplain to Robert Runcie, then Bishop of St Albans; he continued in the role when Runcie became Archbishop of Canterbury. Then, in 1984, he joined St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Rochester Row, in the Diocese of London, as its priest-in-charge. He was made its vicar in 1986, and continued to lead the parish until he was made a bishop in 1992.

He received a Lambeth Bachelor of Divinity degree and holds honorary doctorates from Brunel University, City University London, London Metropolitan University, St. Mary&#x27;s University College, and London Guildhall University.

===Gresham professor===
From 1987 to 1992, he was a Professor of Divinity at Gresham College in London. Based on a three-part lecture series, given in May 1992, he published &quot;A Brief History of Gresham College 1597–1997&quot;. During the first lecture of the original lecture series he referred to the college as a &quot;magical island like Atlantis&quot; disappearing and re-emerging from the sea. This was a reference both to the Invisible College and Francis Bacon&#x27;s New Atlantis.

Other Gresham lectures by Chartres covered the Shroud of Turin (November 1988) and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (December 1989) when he spoke about the &quot;Gresham Jerusalem Project&quot; as well as on prayer (1991).

===Bishop===
On 15 May 1992, Chartres was nominated area Bishop of Stepney. He was consecrated as bishop on 22 May 1992 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury.

In November 1995, Chartres was enthroned as the Bishop of London, also becoming Prelate of the Order of the British Empire, Dean of the Chapels Royal and a Privy Counsellor. In 1997 he was appointed a Chaplain of the Most Venerable Order of Saint John (ChStJ). An Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple since 1998, he is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Companies of Merchant Taylors and of Drapers, and has been admitted as an Honorary Freeman of the Grocers&#x27;, Vintners&#x27;, Weavers&#x27; and the Woolmen&#x27;s Companies.

In 1997, Chartres was one of the executors of the will of Diana, Princess of Wales, and delivered an address at her memorial service in 2007. He confirmed both the Prince and Princess of Wales. On 12 September 2009 he presided at the marriage of Lord Frederick Windsor to actress Sophie Winkleman at the Chapel Royal in Hampton Court Palace.

Chartres is the founder and chairman of the trustees of the St Ethelburga&#x27;s Centre for Reconciliation and Peace. He is also a trustee of &quot;Coexist&quot;, sitting on the advisory council of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. In October 2005, he joined Marianne Suhr at St Giles in the Fields, London WC2, to launch a new maintenance project for the capital&#x27;s historic churches.

In January 2006, Chartres was criticised by the media for his decision to spend Easter on a cruise ship giving lectures on theology rather than attend the services at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. At the time, Chartres was on a two-month sabbatical, his first in 33 years. He preached the sermon at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. In 2013, Chartres led the funeral service of Baroness Thatcher, with whom he had a close friendship.

Chartres oversaw the Church of England&#x27;s relations with the Eastern Orthodox churches, representing the Church of England at the funeral of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow of the Russian Orthodox Church and the enthronement of his successor, Kirill I, at Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral.

On 19 July 2016, it was announced that Chartres was to retire as Bishop of London effective from Shrove Tuesday, 28 February 2017, but remain as Dean of the Chapels Royal until the next Bishop of London took post. He retired as dean following his 72nd birthday in July 2019, being succeeded by Dame Sarah Mullally.

===Green issues===
Since its launch in 2006, Chartres has led the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;shrinking the footprint&quot; campaign, aimed at cutting 80% of the Church&#x27;s carbon emissions by 2050. In the launch and subsequently, Chartres criticised pollution of the planet by people going on holidays by plane. Michael O&#x27;Leary, boss of the low-cost airline Ryanair, responded that &quot;the Bishop of London has got empty churches – presumably if no one went on holidays perhaps they might turn up and listen to his sermons. God bless the Bishop!&quot; Also, after criticism that his taking flights for &quot;diocese work&quot; as well as retaining a chauffeur-driven car were against the ideals of this campaign, he pledged not to fly for a year.

In October 2008, the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; named Chartres as number 75 of the top 100 environmentalists in Britain on their &quot;Green List&quot;.

===Patronage===

==Personal life==
In 1982, Chartres married Caroline (eldest daughter of Sir Alan McLintock), then a freelance writer and now the commissioning editor of a publishing house, with whom he has four children: Alexander, Sophie, Louis and Clio. 

Lord Chartres is a member of the Garrick Club in London.

In 2023 he became a vice president of the National Churches Trust.

==Honours and awards==
Appointed a Chaplain of the Order of St John in 1997, and a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Chartres was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on his retirement as Dean of the Chapels Royal on 11 July 2019: as is customary for Church of England clergy who receive the accolade of the realm, Chartres never used the honorific prefix of &quot;Sir&quot;.

On 12 October 2017, it was announced that Chartres would be created a life peer, to sit on the crossbenches in the House of Lords, having previously sat on the Bishops&#x27; bench. Taking the title of &quot;Baron Chartres, of Wilton in the County of Wiltshire&quot;, he was introduced to the Upper House as a Lord Temporal on 7 November 2017.

<text>Uxbridge is a London Underground station in Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon, north-west London. The station is the terminus of the Uxbridge branches of both the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines. The next station towards London is Hillingdon. The station is 15.5 miles (25 km) west of Charing Cross and is in Travelcard Zone 6. The closest station on the Chiltern Line and Central line is West Ruislip, accessible by the U1 and U10 buses. The closest station on the Elizabeth line is West Drayton, accessible by the U1, U3, U5 and 222 buses. Uxbridge was formerly the terminus of a branch of the District line which ran from Ealing Common; the Piccadilly line took over in 1933.

== History ==
The Harrow and Uxbridge Railway (later merged into the Metropolitan Railway) first opened a station in Uxbridge on 4 July 1904 on Belmont Road, a short distance to the north of the existing station. The station was situated on a different track alignment, now used as sidings. The original service from central London was provided by steam-drawn trains but electrification took place the following year.
The London United Tramways extension from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush was opened a few weeks before the underground station. The manager, as reported in a local newspaper at the time, commented on the high prices of the underground journey: &quot;The tram journey took well over an hour to reach Shepards Bush&quot;.

On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened, enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge. The original Belmont Road station had two platforms, and after the introduction of shared operation one platform was used by each line.

On 23 October 1933 District line services to Uxbridge were replaced by Piccadilly line trains.

On 4 December 1938 the current station was opened on a new alignment.

On 12 January 1983, the station buildings were given Grade II listed status.

The London Borough of Hillingdon announced in June 2011 that it would be lobbying Transport for London to have the Central line diverted from West Ruislip station to Uxbridge. Such a project would require a business case approved by TfL and the completion of signal upgrade work on the Metropolitan line.

== Design ==

The station was designed by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell and features a red-brick facade with paired sculptures by Joseph Armitage over the entrance, representing stylised &quot;winged wheels&quot; with leaf springs. A tall concrete canopy arches over the tracks with a row of clerestory windows above the platforms. The canopy at Uxbridge is similar to the one at Cockfosters, the terminus at the other end of the Piccadilly line. The station is below street level in a cutting.

The stained glass panels by Erwin Bossanyi at the booking hall end of the platforms reflect the area&#x27;s heraldic associations. The crown and three seaxes on a red background are the arms of Middlesex County Council and the chained swan on a black and red background is associated with Buckinghamshire. The centre shield is possibly the arms of the local Basset family; a downward-pointing red triangle on a gold background was borrowed from the Bassett arms for use on the arms of Uxbridge Urban District Council in 1948.

The forecourt of the new station was originally laid out to provide a turning circle for trolleybuses, which replaced trams in 1936. Ticket barriers are in operation.

<doc id="339079" wikidata="Q7224" url="?curid=339079" title="Emperor Jing of Han">
<text>Emperor Jing of Han (188 BC – 9 March 141 BC), born Liu Qi, was the sixth emperor of the Han dynasty from 157 to 141 BC. His reign saw the limiting of the power of the feudal kings and princes which resulted in the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC. Emperor Jing managed to crush the revolt and princes were thereafter denied rights to appoint ministers for their fiefs. This move helped to consolidate central power which paved the way for the long reign of his son Emperor Wu of Han.

Emperor Jing had a complicated personality. He continued his father Emperor Wen&#x27;s policy of general non-interference with the people, reduced tax and other burdens, and promoted government thrift. He continued and magnified his father&#x27;s policy of reduction in criminal sentences. His light governance of the people was due to the Taoist influences of his mother, Empress Dou. Still, during his reign he arrested and imprisoned Zhou Yafu, and he was generally ungrateful to his wife Empress Bo.

He was the last emperor of Han who was the common ancestor of all subsequent emperors; all subsequent emperors of the Western Han were descendants of Emperor Wu, while all emperors of the Eastern Han were descendants of his sixth son Liu Fa, Prince Ding of Changsha.

==Early life and career as crown prince==

Emperor Jing was born to Emperor Wen, then Prince of Dai, and Consort Dou, one of his favorite consorts, in 188 BC. He was his father&#x27;s oldest son. After his father became emperor in November 180 BC, then-Prince Qi was made crown prince in February or March 179 BC. Two months later, his mother was made empress.

In his childhood as crown prince, Prince Qi was praised for being compassionate. He was deeply influenced by his mother Empress Dou, who was a Taoist and required all of her children and grandchildren to study Taoist doctrines. He also developed deep bonds with his older sister Princess Liu Piao (劉嫖) and his younger brother Liu Wu (劉武), both also born of Empress Dou.

As Prince Qi grew in age, as was customary, he established his own household, and a member of his household, Chao Cuo (晁錯), known for his intelligence and ruthless efficiency as well as his rhetorical talent, became a trusted adviser of Prince Qi. Despise this, Liu Qi has been known to taken an epicurean lifestyle to the point that Emperor Wen once considered deposing him as Crown Prince to Liu Wu, Prince of Liang, but dropped the matter as many officials opposed the idea.

In July 157 BC, Emperor Wen died, and Prince Qi became emperor. In accordance with Emperor Wen&#x27;s will, the period of mourning was shortened. Emperor Jing&#x27;s grandmother Empress Dowager Bo became grand empress dowager, and Empress Dou became empress dowager. Prince Qi&#x27;s wife, Crown Princess Bo (a member of his grandmother&#x27;s clan) became empress.

==Early reign==
When he became Emperor, in contrast with many official&#x27;s thinking, which was that Emperor Jing would be a bad leader like Jie, Zhou and You, with the danger of collapse of the Han dynasty imminent, the officials were shocked at Liu Qi&#x27;s sudden change of personality and he proved to be a capable ruler. Emperor Jing was deeply and strongly influenced by his mother, Empress Dou, who was considered powerful and dangerous both because of her position as the emperor&#x27;s mother and because of the influence she had on the emperor. Because of her influence, Emperor Jing largely continued his father&#x27;s policy of non-interference with the people and reduction of tax and other burdens. Under Jing, taxes were cut in half, to one-thirtieth of the crop. He continued his policy of reducing criminal penalties, and in 156 BC, in reaction to the reality that his father&#x27;s abolition of corporal punishments of cutting off nose and feet were in fact causing more people to die from whipping, reduced the number of whips that criminals would receive. (He would later reduce the penalty again in 144 BC.) He also continued his father&#x27;s policy of heqin (marriage treaties) with Xiongnu, which largely avoided large conflicts with that northern neighbor. However, one immediate issue confronting Emperor Jing was the power possessed by princes of collateral lines of the imperial clan. The princes often built up their own military strengths and resisted edicts issued by the emperor. This was already an issue in Emperor Wen&#x27;s days, but Emperor Wen did not take any decisive actions on the issue.

Emperor Jing did not designate a crown prince for the first few years of his reign, because Empress Bo did not have any sons. His mother, the Dowager Empress Dou, wanted him to make his younger brother Liu Wu, the Prince of Liang, the crown prince, but this did not happen because of opposition by officials. However, Liu Wu was given many privileges not given to other princes.

==The Rebellion of the Seven States==
The issue of dealing with powerful princes would soon erupt into a war later known as the Rebellion of the Seven States. Emperor Jing already had an inimical relationship with his cousin-once-removed (a nephew of his grandfather Emperor Gaozu) Liu Pi (劉濞), the prince of the wealthy Principality of Wu (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and northern Jiangxi), which enjoyed, among other natural resources, abundant copper and salt supplies. While Emperor Jing was crown prince, Liu Pi&#x27;s heir apparent Liu Xian (劉賢) had been on an official visit to the capital Chang&#x27;an, and they gambled together by playing the &quot;liubo&quot; board game (heavily tied to divination and predictions of the future). While playing the board game, Liu Xian offended then-Crown Prince Qi, and Prince Qi threw the wooden board at Liu Xian, killing him. Liu Pi thus had great hatred for the new emperor.

Chao Cuo&#x27;s advice for Emperor Jing was to, using as excuses offenses that princes have committed which had generally been ignored by Emperor Wen, cut down the sizes of the principalities to make them less threatening. Chao explicitly contemplated the possibility that Wu and other principalities may rebel, but justified the action by asserting that if they were going to rebel, it would be better to let them rebel earlier than later, when they might be more prepared. Under this theory, Emperor Jing, in 154 BC, carved out one commandery each from the Principalities of Chu (modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui) and Zhao and six counties from the Principality of Jiaoxi (roughly modern Weifang, Shandong), before carving two commanderies out of Wu.

Wu did indeed start a rebellion, in alliance with Chu, Jiaoxi, Zhao, and three other smaller principalities—Jiaodong, Zichuan, and Jinan. Two other principalities that originally agreed to join, Qi (modern central Shandong) and Jibei (modern northwestern Shandong), reneged at the final moment. Wu also sought assistance from the independent kingdoms of Dong&#x27;ou (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian); while Dong&#x27;ou contributed forces, Minyue did not. Zhao sought assistance from Xiongnu, but while Xiongnu initially agreed to help, it did not actually enter the war.

In accordance with instructions left by Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing commissioned Zhou Yafu as the commander of his armed forces to face the main rebel force—joint forces of Wu and Chu. However, he soon panicked at the prospect of losing, and at the suggestion of Chao Cuo&#x27;s enemy Yuan Ang, he executed Chao to try to appease the seven princes, to no avail.

Wu and Chu forces were fiercely attacking the Principality of Liang (modern eastern Henan), whose prince Liu Wu, prince of Liang was Emperor Jing&#x27;s beloved younger brother, and Emperor Jing ordered Zhou to immediately head to Liang to save it. Zhou refused, reasoning that the proper strategy would involve first cutting off the Wu and Chu supply lines, thus starving them, so he headed to the northeast side of Liang and around the Wu and Chu forces to cut off their supplies. The strategy was effective. Wu and Chu, unable to capture Liang quickly and realizing that their supplies were dwindling, headed northeast to attack Zhou. After being unable to get a decisive victory against Zhou, the Wu and Chu forces collapsed from starvation. Liu Pi fled to Donghai, which killed him and sought peace with Han. Liu Wu, the Prince of Chu, committed suicide. The other principalities involved were all eventually defeated as well.

==Middle reign and succession issues==
In 153 BC, because Empress Bo did not have a son, Emperor Jing made his oldest son Liu Rong (劉榮) crown prince. This made Liu Rong&#x27;s mother, Consort Li (栗姬), who was one of Emperor Jing&#x27;s favorite concubines, think she would be made empress, particularly after Empress Bo was deposed in 151 BC, following Grand Empress Dowager Bo&#x27;s death. She hated Emperor Jing&#x27;s sister Princess Liu Piao, because Princess Piao had often given her brother beautiful women as concubines, drawing Consort Li&#x27;s jealousy. When Princess Piao wanted to end this dispute by giving her daughter Chen Jiao as wife to Prince Rong, Consort Li refused.

Princess Piao, seeing the precarious state that she would be in if Consort Li became empress dowager one day, carried out an alternative plan. She gave Chen Jiao as wife to Liu Che, the son of Emperor Jing&#x27;s other favorite concubine, Wang Zhi, the Prince of Jiaodong. She then incessantly criticized Consort Li for her jealousy—pointing out that, if Consort Li became empress dowager, many concubines might suffer the fates of Consort Qi, Emperor Gao&#x27;s favorite concubine who was tortured and killed by Emperor Gao&#x27;s wife Lü Zhi after Emperor Gao&#x27;s death. Emperor Jing eventually agreed, and he deposed Prince Rong from his position in 150 BC. Consort Li died in anger. That year, Consort Wang was made empress, and Prince Che the crown prince.

Prince Rong would not be spared. In 148 BC, he was accused of intruding onto the grounds of his grandfather Emperor Wen&#x27;s temple when building the walls to his palace. He was imprisoned and not permitted to write to his father. His granduncle Dou Ying (竇嬰, Empress Dowager Dou&#x27;s brother or cousin) slipped in a knife pen; he wrote a letter and then committed suicide.

A major incident involving another potential heir, Prince Wu of Liang, erupted in 148 BC as well. Prince Wu, because of his contributions to the victory during the Rebellion of the Seven States, was further given privilege to use imperial ceremonies and colors. Members of his household encouraged him to seek to become crown prince. This was favored by the empress dowager Dou as well, but opposed by the minister Yuan Ang, who believed such a move would bring instability to dynastic succession. When Prince Wu sought permission to build a highway directly from his capital Suiyang to Chang&#x27;an, Yuan, fearing that the highway might be used for military purposes if Liang rebelled, opposed it. Prince Wu had him assassinated. Emperor Jing was extremely angry and sent many investigators to Liang to track down the conspirators, whom Prince Wu eventually surrendered. Emperor Jing, afraid of offending his mother and still affectionate for his brother, pardoned Prince Wu but no longer considered him as possible heir.

==Late reign==

The late reign of Emperor Jing was marked by an incident for which he was much criticized: the death of Zhou Yafu, who had been instrumental in the victory against the Seven States. As prime minister, Zhou offended nearly every powerful figure around Emperor Jing, in particular his brother Prince Liu Wu and his mother Empress Dowager Dou (for refusing to save Liang first when Liang was sieged by the combined forces of Wu and Chu), and his wife Empress Wang and her brother Wang Xin (王信), whom Emperor Jing wanted to make a marquess but whose candidacy Zhou rebuffed. By 143 BC, he was retired when his son, in anticipation of his death, purchased retired armor and weapons from the imperial armory to serve as burial decorations. Zhou&#x27;s son refused to pay the delivery workers, and the delivery workers, in retaliation, accused the Zhous of treason. Emperor Jing had Zhou Yafu arrested and interrogated, and the interrogator, when told by Zhou that the armor and weapons were for burial purposes, accused him of &quot;underground treason&quot;—i.e., ready to commit treason against the spirits of the emperors after he himself dies. Zhou committed suicide in prison.

Emperor Jing died in 141 BC and was buried in the Han Yang Ling Mausoleum in Chang&#x27;an. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Che (as Emperor Wu).

== Legacy ==

His reign, along with that of his father Emperor Wen, known as the &quot;Rule of Wen and Jing&quot;, was considered to be one of the golden ages in Chinese history. However, it is also apparent from his actions that he lacked the warmth and openness his father had, and in many ways his reign was marked by political intrigue and treachery. This coldness applied to Jing&#x27;s inner circle as well; it is said of his relationship with the palace guard Zhou Wenren that &#x27;the emperor loved him more than most people, but not as much as other emperors loved their male favorites.&#x27;

Emperor Jing can also be credited for furthering the study of Taoist text after he recognized the Tao Te Ching as a Chinese classic during his rule.

In 2016, the discovery of the earliest tea traces known to date from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing in Xi&#x27;an was announced, indicating that tea was drunk by Han dynasty emperors as early as second century BC.

==Era names==

These &quot;era names&quot; are not true &quot;era names&quot; in the sense that the era name system, as instituted by Emperor Jing&#x27;s son Emperor Wu, had not come into place. Emperor Jing, in accordance to prior imperial calendaring systems, would have simply referred to the number of years in his reign, but for unknown reasons reset the count twice, thus requiring historians to refer to them separately.

<doc id="339081" wikidata="Q1137833" url="?curid=339081" title="Core cities of Japan">
<text>A is a class or category of Japanese cities. It is a local administrative division created by the national government. Core cities are delegated many functions normally carried out by prefectural governments, but not as many as designated cities. To become a candidate for core city status, a city must have a population greater than 300,000 and an area greater than 100 square kilometers, although special exceptions may be made by order of the cabinet for cities with populations under 300,000 but over 200,000. After the abolition of special city status on April 1, 2015, any city with a population above 200,000 may apply for core city status.

Application for designation is made by a city with the approval of both the city and prefectural assemblies.

==History==
The term &quot;core city&quot; was created by the first clause of Article 252, Section 22 of the Local Autonomy Law of Japan.

== List of core cities==
As of 1 April 2021, 62 cities have been designated core cities: 

== Former core cities ==
== Scheduled to become a core city ==
== Cities that meet the requirements but have not yet been nominated ==
The following cities have populations greater than 200,000 but have not yet been nominated. (Special cities and cities planning to apply for core city status are not shown.)

<text>Emperor Wu of Han (30 July 157 – 29 March 87BC), born Liu Che and courtesy name Tong, was the seventh emperor of the Han dynasty from 141 to 87 BC. His reign lasted 54 years – a record not broken until the reign of the Kangxi Emperor more than 1,800 years later – and remains the record for ethnic Han emperors. His reign resulted in a vast expansion of geopolitical influence for the Chinese civilization, and the development of a strong centralized state via governmental policies, economical reorganization and promotion of a hybrid Legalist–Confucian doctrine. In the field of historical social and cultural studies, Emperor Wu is known for his religious innovations and patronage of the poetic and musical arts, including development of the Imperial Music Bureau into a prestigious entity. It was also during his reign that cultural contact with western Eurasia was greatly increased, directly and indirectly.

During his reign as Emperor, he led the Han dynasty through its greatest territorial expansion. At its height, the Empire&#x27;s borders spanned from the Fergana Valley in the west, to northern Korea in the east, and to northern Vietnam in the south. Emperor Wu successfully repelled the nomadic Xiongnu from systematically raiding northern China, and dispatched his envoy Zhang Qian into the Western Regions in 139 BC to seek an alliance with the Greater Yuezhi and Kangju, which resulted in further diplomatic missions to Central Asia. Although historical records do not describe him as being aware of Buddhism, emphasizing rather his interest in shamanism, the cultural exchanges that occurred as a consequence of these embassies suggest that he received Buddhist statues from Central Asia, as depicted in the murals found in the Mogao Caves.

Emperor Wu is considered one of the greatest emperors in Chinese history due to his strong leadership and effective governance, which made the Han dynasty one of the most powerful nations in the world. Michael Loewe called the reign of Emperor Wu the &quot;high point&quot; of &quot;Modernist&quot; (classically justified Legalist) policies, looking back to &quot;adapt ideas from the pre-Han period.&quot; Especially later in his life, some of his most trusted advisers were proponents of Shang Yang, but did not necessarily support Shang Yang&#x27;s harsh punishments. Despite establishing an autocratic, centralised state, Emperor Wu adopted the principles of Confucianism as the state philosophy and code of ethics for his empire and started a school to teach future administrators the Confucian classics. These reforms had an enduring effect throughout the existence of imperial China and an enormous influence on neighbouring civilizations.

==Names and dates==
The personal name of Emperor Wu was Liu Che (劉徹). The use of &quot;Han&quot; () in referring to emperor Wu is a reference to the Han dynasty of which he was a part. His family name is &quot;Liu&quot;; the ruling family or clan of the Han dynasty shared the family name of &quot;Liu&quot;, the family name of Liu Bang, the founding father of the Han dynasty. The character &quot;Di&quot; () is a title: this is the Chinese word which in imperial history of China means &quot;emperor&quot;. The character &quot;Wu&quot; () literally means &quot;martial&quot; or &quot;warlike&quot;, but is also related to the concept of a particular divinity in the historical Chinese religious pantheon existing at that time. Combined, &quot;Wu&quot; plus &quot;di&quot; makes the name &quot;Wudi&quot;, the emperor&#x27;s posthumous name used for historical and religious purposes, such as offering him posthumous honours at his tomb. The emperor&#x27;s temple tablet name is Shizong (世宗).

===Regnal years===
One of Han Wudi&#x27;s innovations was the practice of changing reign names after a number of years, as deemed auspicious or to commemorate some event. Thus, the practice for dating years during the reign of Wudi was represented by the &quot;nth&quot; year of the [Reign Year Name] (where &quot;nth&quot; stands for an ordinal integer) and &quot;Reign Year Name&quot; for the specific name of that regnal year. This practice was continued by later emperors until the Ming and Qing eras, whereby the emperors of the two dynasties used only one reign name for their entire reign (unless interrupted, as in the case of Emperor Yingzong of Ming).

===Calendar reform===

In 104 BC (1st year of the &quot;Taichu&quot; (太初) era), a new calendar was put into effect: the &quot;Taichu&quot; calendar (太初历). This calendar came about due to the observations of three officials (Gongsun Qing (公孙卿), Hu Sui (壶遂) and Sima Qian (author of &quot;Shiji&quot;) that the calendar then in use was in need of reform. Among other reforms, the &quot;Taichu&quot; calendar made the &quot;zheng&quot; month (正月, also known as the first month) the beginning of a new year, rather than the tenth month in the &quot;Zhuanxu&quot; calendar. From then on, the Chinese calendar had retained the property of having the first month as the beginning of the year.

==Early years==
Liu Che was the 11th son of Liu Qi, the oldest living son from Emperor Wen of Han. His mother Wang Zhi (王娡) was initially married to a commoner named Jin Wangsun (金王孫) and had a daughter from that marriage. However, her mother Zang Er (臧儿) (a granddaughter of the one-time Prince of Yan, Zang Tu, under Emperor Gao) was told by a soothsayer that both Wang Zhi and her younger sister would one day become extremely honoured. She then got the idea to offer her daughters to the then crown prince Liu Qi, and forcibly divorced Wang Zhi from her husband at the time. After being offered to Liu Qi, Wang Zhi bore him three daughters – Princess Yangxin, Princess Nangong (南宫公主), and Princess Longlü.

On the day of Liu Qi&#x27;s accession to the throne as Emperor Jing of Han (upon the death of his father Emperor Wen in 30 July 157 BC), Wang Zhi gave birth to Liu Che and was promoted to a consort for giving birth to a royal prince. While she was pregnant, she claimed that she dreamed of a sun falling into her womb. Emperor Jing was ecstatic over the divine implication, and made the young Liu Che the Prince of Jiaodong (胶东王) on 16 May 153 BC. An intelligent boy, Liu Che was considered to be Emperor Jing&#x27;s favourite son from a very young age.

==Crown prince==
Emperor Jing&#x27;s formal wife, Empress Bo, was childless. As a result, Emperor Jing&#x27;s oldest son Liu Rong, born to Lady Lì (栗姬, Emperor Jing&#x27;s favorite concubine and mother of three of his first four sons), was made crown prince in 153 BC. Lady Li, feeling certain that her son would become the future emperor, grew arrogant and intolerant, and frequently threw tantrums at Emperor Jing out of jealousy over him bedding other women. Her lack of tact provided the opportunity for Consort Wang and the young Liu Che to gain the emperor&#x27;s favour.

When Emperor Jing&#x27;s older sister, Eldest Princess Guantao (馆陶长公主) Liu Piao (刘嫖), offered to marry her daughter with (), the Marquess of Tangyi, to Liu Rong, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal out of her dislike of Princess Guantao, who often procured new concubines for Emperor Jing and was diffusing the favor received by Lady Li. Insulted by the rejection, Princess Guantao then approached the next favorite of Emperor Jing&#x27;s concubines – none other than Consort Wang, who had been observing these developments quietly from the sidelines. Guantao offered to marry her daughter to the consort&#x27;s young son, Liu Che, then aged only 5. Seizing the opportunity, Consort Wang accepted the offer with open arms, securing a crucial political alliance with Princess Guantao.

Princess Guantao&#x27;s daughter Chen Jiao, also known by the milk name A&#x27;Jiao (阿嬌), was of marriageable age (which was legally marked at the time by menarche), making her at least eight years older than the young prince. Due to this age difference, Emperor Jing initially did not approve of this union. According to the Wei-Jin era fable &quot;Hanwu Stories&quot; (漢武故事 / 汉武故事 also called &quot;Stories of Han Wudi&quot;), during a subsequent royal gathering, Princess Guantao held the 5-year-old Liu Che in her arms and asked the nephew whether he wanted to marry his first cousin A&#x27;Jiao. The young prince boasted that he would &quot;build a golden house for her&quot; if they were married. Princess Guantao then used the boy&#x27;s response as a divine sign to convince Emperor Jing to finally agree to the arranged marriage between Liu Che and Chen Jiao. This inspired the Chinese idiom &quot;putting Jiao in a golden house&quot; (金屋藏嬌).

Now sealed in the marriage alliance with Consort Wang, Princess Guantao began incessantly criticising Lady Li in front of Emperor Jing. Over time, Emperor Jing started to believe his sister&#x27;s words, so he decided to test out Lady Li. One day he asked Lady Li whether she would happily foster-care the rest of his children if he were to pass away, only to have her rudely refuse to comply. This made Emperor Jing angry and worried that if Liu Rong were to inherit the throne and Lady Li to become empress dowager, many of his concubines might suffer the tragic fate of Consort Qi in the hands of Empress Lü. Princess Guantao then began to openly praise her son-in-law-to-be to her royal brother, further convincing Emperor Jing that Liu Che was a far better choice for heir apparent than Liu Rong.

Taking advantage of the situation, Consort Wang put in place the final step to defeat Lady Li – she persuaded a minister to officially advise Emperor Jing that he make Lady Li empress, as Liu Rong was already the crown prince. Emperor Jing, already firm in his view that Lady Li must not be made empress, was enraged and believed that Lady Li had conspired with government officials. He executed the clan of the minister who had made that proposal, and deposed Liu Rong from the crown prince to the Prince of Linjiang (臨江王) and exiling him from the capital city Chang&#x27;an in 150 BC. Lady Li was stripped of her titles and placed under house arrest; she died of depression not long after. Liu Rong was arrested two years later for illegal seizure of imperial shrine lands and committed suicide while in custody.

As Empress Bo had been deposed one year earlier in 151 BC, the position of empress was left open and Emperor Jing made Consort Wang empress four months later. The seven-year-old Liu Che, now legally the oldest son of the Empress, was made crown prince in 149 BC.

In 141 BC, Emperor Jing died and Crown Prince Liu Che ascended to the throne as Emperor Wu at the age of 15. His grandmother Empress Dowager Dou became the grand empress dowager, and his mother became Empress Dowager Wang. His cousin-wife A&#x27;Jiao from the political child marriage officially became Empress Chen.

==Early reign and reform attempt==
The Han dynasty up to this point was run according to a Taoist &quot;wu wei&quot; ideology, championing economic freedom and government decentralization. With regards to foreign policy, periodic &quot;heqin&quot; was used to maintain a &quot;de jure&quot; &quot;peace&quot; with the powerful Xiongnu confederacy to the north. These policies were important in stimulating economic recovery following the post-Qin dynasty civil war, but had their drawbacks. The non-interventionist policies resulted in loss of monetary regulation and political control by the central government, allowing the feudal vassal states to become powerful and unruly, culminating in the Rebellion of the Seven States during Emperor Jing&#x27;s reign. Nepotism among the ruling class also stagnated social mobility and encouraged nobles&#x27; rampant disregard of laws, leading to the rise of local despots who bullied and oppressed the population. The &quot;heqin&quot; policy also failed to protect the Han borders against nomadic raids, with Xiongnu cavalries invading as close as 300 &quot;li&quot; (100 miles, 160 km) from the capital during Emperor Wen&#x27;s reign, and over 10,000 border residents abducted or enslaved during Emperor Jing&#x27;s reign. Prominent politicians like Jia Yi and Chao Cuo had both previously advised on the necessity of important policy reforms, but neither Emperor Wen nor Emperor Jing was willing to risk implementing such changes.

Unlike the emperors before him, the young and vigorous Emperor Wu was unwilling to put up with the &quot;status quo&quot;. Only a year into his reign in late 141 BC, Emperor Wu took the advice of Confucian scholars and launched an ambitious reform, known in history as the Jianyuan Reforms (建元新政). The reforms included:

#Officially endorsing Confucianism as the national philosophy (乡儒术). Previously, the more libertarian Taoist ideals were held in esteem;
#Forcing noblemen back to their own fiefdoms (令列侯就国). A large number of noblemen were living in the capital Chang&#x27;an, lobbying court officials while exploiting the central government&#x27;s budget to cover their expenses despite already having gained great wealth from their own feudal land tenure taxation. Emperor Wu&#x27;s new policy dictated that they could no longer live off the government&#x27;s spending and must leave the capital if lacking any justifiable reason to keep staying;
#Removing checkpoints that were not sanctioned by the central government (除关). Many lords of vassal states had established checkpoints along main state roads that went through their territory with the purpose of collecting tolls and restricting traffic. Emperor Wu wanted to seize the control of transportation from local authorities and return that control back to the central government;
#Encouraging the reporting and prosecution of criminal activities by nobles (举谪宗室无行者). Noblemen engaged in illegal activities would be impeached and punished and their assets or lands could be confiscated back as state property;
#Recruiting and promoting talented commoners in government positions (招贤良) in order to reduce the administrative monopoly by the noble class.

However, Emperor Wu&#x27;s reforms threatened the interests of the nobles and were swiftly defeated by his powerful grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Dou, who held real political power in the Han court and supported the conservative factions. Most of the reformists were punished: Emperor Wu&#x27;s two noble supporters Dou Ying (窦婴) and Tian Fen (田蚡, Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s half-brother and Emperor&#x27;s uncle) lost their positions, and his two mentors Wang Zang (王臧) and Zhao Wan (赵绾) were impeached, arrested and forced to commit suicide in prison.

Emperor Wu, deprived of any allies, was now the subject of conspiracies designed to have him removed from the throne. For example, his first wife Empress Chen Jiao was unable to become pregnant. In an attempt to remain his first love, she had prohibited him from having other concubines. Emperor Wu&#x27;s political enemies used his childlessness as an argument to seek to depose him, as the inability of an emperor to propagate a royal bloodline was a serious matter. These enemies of Emperor Wu wished to replace him with his cousin Liu An, the King of Huainan, who was renowned for his expertise in Taoist ideology. Even Emperor Wu&#x27;s own maternal uncle Tian Fen switched camps and sought Liu An&#x27;s favor, as he predicted the young emperor would not be in power for long. Emperor Wu&#x27;s political survival now relied heavily on the lobbying of his influential aunt / mother-in-law, Princess Guantao (Liu Piao), who served as a mediator in seeking the Emperor&#x27;s reconciliation with his powerful grandmother. Princess Guantao took every opportunity to influence the Grand Empress and also constantly made demands on behalf of her nephew / son-in-law.

Emperor Wu, already unhappy with his lack of an heir and Empress Chen&#x27;s spoiled behavior, was further enraged by her mother Princess Liu Piao&#x27;s greed, that she took a lot from him in everything she did for him. However, Emperor Wu&#x27;s mother, Empress Dowager Wang, convinced him to tolerate Empress Chen and Liu Piao for the time being, as his aging grandmother was declining physically and would soon die. He spent the next few years pretending to have given up any political ambition, playing the part of a docile hedonist, often sneaking out of the capital Chang&#x27;an to engage in hunting and sightseeing and posing as an ordinary nobleman.

==Solidifying power==
Knowing that the conservative noble classes occupied every level of the Han court, Emperor Wu changed his strategy. He secretly recruited a circle of young loyal supporters from ordinary backgrounds and promoted them to middle-level positions in order to infiltrate executive ranks in the government. These newly established officials, known as the &quot;insider court&quot; (内朝), took orders and reported directly to Emperor Wu. They had real influence over the operation of government affairs though lower in rank. They became a powerful counter against the &quot;outsider court&quot; (外朝) made up of the Three Lords and Nine Ministers that, at the time, were mostly composed of anti-reformists. Furthermore, Emperor Wu sent out nationwide edicts appealing to grassroots scholars such as Gongsun Hong to enrol in government services in an attempt to break the stranglehold that the older-generation noble class had on the nation&#x27;s levers of power.

In 138 BC, the southern autonomous state of Minyue (in modern-day Fujian) invaded the weaker neighbouring state of Dong&#x27;ou (in modern-day Zhejiang). After their king Zuo Zhenfu (驺贞复) died on the battlefield, the battered Dong&#x27;ou desperately sought help from the Han court. After a heated court debate over whether to offer military intervention for such a distant vassal state, Emperor Wu dispatched a newly promoted official Yan Zhu (严助) to Kuaiji (then still located in Suzhou, rather than Shaoxing) to mobilize the local garrison. However the tiger tally, which was needed to authorize any use of armed forces, was in Grand Empress Dowager Dou&#x27;s possession at the time. Yan Zhu, as the appointed imperial ambassador, circumvented this problem by executing a local army commander who refused to obey any order without seeing the tiger tally and coerced the governor of Kuaiji to mobilize a large naval fleet to Dong&#x27;ou&#x27;s rescue. Seeing that superior Han forces were on the way, Minyue forces became fearful and retreated. This was a huge political victory for Emperor Wu and set the precedent of using the Emperor&#x27;s decrees to bypass the tiger tally, removing the need for cooperation from his grandmother; Of course, this did not mean that Grand Empress Dowager Dou&#x27;s influence and intervention would disappear, she was a serious and insurmountable obstacle and competing authority in administration for Emperor Wu until the end of her life. But now with the military firmly in his control, Emperor Wu&#x27;s political survival was assured, and his grandmother or anyone else could no longer threaten to dethrone him as directly, easily and quickly as before.

In the same year, Emperor Wu&#x27;s newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with his first child, effectively clearing his name and silencing any political enemies who had schemed to use his alleged infertility as an excuse to have him removed. When this news reached the state of Huainan, Liu An, who was hoping the young Emperor Wu&#x27;s infertility would allow him to ascend to the throne, went into a state of denial and rewarded anyone who told him that Emperor Wu was still childless.

In 135 BC, Grand Empress Dowager Dou died, removing the last major obstacle against Emperor Wu&#x27;s ambition for reform.
==Imperial expansion==

===Conquest of the south===

After the death of Grand Empress Dowager Dou in 135 BC, Emperor Wu had full and unrivaled control of the government. While his mother, Empress Dowager Wang, and his uncle Tian Fen were still heavily influential, they also benefited from the death of the old woman, especially the mother of Emperor Wu, but they lacked the ability to restrain the Emperor&#x27;s actions.

Emperor Wu began military campaigns focused on territorial expansion. This decision nearly destroyed his empire in its early stages. Reacting to border incursions by sending out the troops, Emperor Wu sent his armies in all directions but the sea.

====Conquest of Minyue====

Following the successful manoeuvre against Minyue in 138 BC, Emperor Wu resettled the people of Dang&#x27;an into the region between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. In 135 BC, Minyue saw an opportunity to take advantage of the new and inexperienced king of Nanyue, Zhao Mo. Minyue invaded its south-western neighbour and Zhao Mo sought help from the Han court.
Emperor Wu dispatched an amphibious expedition force led by Wang Hui (王恢) and Han Anguo (韩安国) to address the Minyue threat. Again fearing the Han intervention, Luo Yushan (雒余善), the younger brother of Minyue&#x27;s King Ying, orchestrated a coup with other Minyue nobles, killed his brother with a spear, decapitated the corpse and sent the severed head to Wang. Following the campaign, Minyue was split into a dual monarchy: Minyue was controlled by a Han proxy ruler, Zou Chou (驺丑), and Dongyue (东越) was ruled by Luo Yushan.

As Han troops returned from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated military action against Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Lou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached there, blaming the weather while secretly relaying intelligence to Nanyue. Against the advice of General Yang Pu (杨仆), Emperor Wu rejected a military solution, and the Han forces arrived home without attacking Dongyue, though border garrisons were told to prepare for any military conflicts. After King Yushan was informed of this, he became overly confident and proud and responded by revolting against the Han, proclaiming himself emperor and assigned his &quot;Han-devouring generals&quot; (吞汉将军) to invade neighbouring regions controlled by the Han. Enraged, Emperor Wu sent a combined army led by generals Han Yue (韩说), Yang Pu, Wang Wenshu (王温舒) and two marquesses of Yue ancestry. The Han army crushed the rebellion, and the Dongyue kingdom began to fragment after King Yushan stubbornly refused to surrender. Elements of the Dongyue army defected and turned against their ruler. Eventually, the king of the other Minyue state, Zou Jugu (驺居股), conspired with other Dongyue nobles to kill King Yushan before surrendering to the Han forces. The two states of Minyue and Dongyue were then completely annexed under the Han rule.

====Conquest of Nanyue====

In 135 BC, when Minyue attacked Nanyue, Nanyue also sought assistance from Han even though it probably had enough strength to defend itself. Emperor Wu was greatly pleased by this gesture, and he dispatched an expedition force to attack Minyue, over the objection of one of his key advisors, Liu An, a royal relative and the Prince of Huainan. Minyue nobles, fearful of the massive Chinese force, assassinated their king Luo Ying (骆郢) and sought peace. Emperor Wu then imposed a dual-monarchy system on Minyue by creating kings out of Luo Ying&#x27;s brother Luo Yushan (雒余善) and nobleman Zou Chou (驺丑), thus ensuring internal discord in Minyue .

Although initially launched as a punitive expedition by Emperor Wu against the autonomous kingdom of Nanyue, the entire Nanyue territory (which includes modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and North Vietnam) had been conquered by the Emperor&#x27;s military forces and annexed into the Han Empire by 111 BC.

===War against the northern steppes===
Military tension had long existed between China and the northern &quot;barbarians&quot;, mainly because the fertile lands of the prosperous agricultural civilization presented attractive targets for the poorer but more militaristic horseback nomads. The threat posed to the Xiongnu by the northward expansion of the Qin Empire ultimately led to the consolidation of the many tribes into a confederacy. Following the end of the Chu-Han Contention, Emperor Gao of Han realized that the nation was not yet strong enough to confront the Xiongnu. He therefore resorted to the so-called &quot;marriage alliance&quot;, or &quot;heqin&quot;, in order to ease hostility and buy time for the nation to &quot;rest and recover&quot; (休养生息). Despite the periodic humiliation of appeasement and providing gifts, the Han borders were still frequented by Xiongnu raids for the next seven decades. Following the death of his powerful grandmother, Emperor Wu decided that Han China had sufficiently recovered enough to support a full-scale war.

He first ended the official policy of peace with the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, which involved a failed plan to trick a force of 30,000 Xiongnu into an ambush of 300,000 Han soldiers. While neither side suffered any casualties, the Xiongnu retaliated by increasing their border attacks, leading many in the Han court to abandon the hope for peace with the Xiongnu.

The failure of the Mayi operation prompted Emperor Wu to switch the Han army&#x27;s doctrine from the traditionally more defensive chariot–infantry warfare to a highly mobile and offensive cavalry-against-cavalry warfare. At the same time, he expanded and trained officers from his royal guards.

After a series of defeats by Wei Qing (the half-brother of Emperor Wu&#x27;s favourite concubine) and Wei&#x27;s nephew, Huo Qubing between 127 and 119 BC, the Xiongnu were expelled from the Ordos Desert and Qilian Mountains. As a result of these territorial acquisitions, the Han dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct access to trade with Central Asia. This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army. Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor, colonizing the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier-settlers.

The Battle of Mobei (119 BC) saw Han forces invade the northern regions of the Gobi Desert. The two generals led the campaign to the Khangai Mountains where they forced the Chanyu to flee north of the Gobi Desert, and then out of the Gobi Desert.

The Xiongnu, destabilized and worried about further Han attacks, retreated further north into the Siberian regions where they suffered starvation due to livestock loss from harsh climates. The battle was however also costly for the Han forces, which lost almost 80% of their warhorses. The cost of the war led the central Han government to introduce new levies, increasing the burden on average peasants, and the population census of the empire showed a significant drop from famines and people fleeing to avoid having to pay the taxes.

===Invasion of the Korean Peninsula===

Emperor Wu carried out an invasion of the northern Korean Peninsula and established the Commandery of Canghai, but abandoned it in 126 BC. Some of the military colonies established at that time survived into the 4th century, leaving behind various particularly well-preserved funerary artefacts. After the conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC, Emperor Wu launched a second invasion of the Korean peninsula and by 108 BC completed the Han conquest of Gojoseon in what is now present-day North Korea and Manchuria. Han Chinese colonists in the Xuantu and Lelang commanderies of northern Korea would later fight against frequent raids by the Goguryeo and Buyeo kingdoms. However, they would engage in mostly peaceful trade relations with surrounding Korean peoples over the centuries, the latter of whom became gradually and significantly influenced by Chinese culture.

==Diplomacy and exploration==
The exploration into Xiyu was first started in 139 BC, when Emperor Wu commissioned Zhang Qian to seek out the Kingdom of Yuezhi, which had been expelled by Xiongnu from the modern Gansu region. Zhang was to entice the kingdom to return to its ancestral lands with promises of Han military assistance, with the intention that Yuezhi forces would fight against the Xiongnu. Zhang was immediately captured by Xiongnu once he ventured into the desert, but was able to escape around 129 BC and eventually made it to Yuezhi, which by then had relocated to Samarkand. While Yuezhi refused to return, it and several other kingdoms in the area, including Dayuan (Kokand) and Kangju, established diplomatic relations with Han. Zhang was able to deliver his report to Emperor Wu when he arrived back in the capital Chang&#x27;an in 126 BC after a second and shorter captivity by Xiongnu. After the Prince of Hunxie surrendered the Gansu region, the path to Xiyu became clear and regular embassies between Han and the Xiyu kingdoms commenced.
Another expansion plan, this one aimed at the south-west, was aimed at the eventual conquest of Nanyue, which was viewed as an unreliable vassal. The plan was to first obtain submission of the south-western tribal kingdoms – the largest of which was Yelang (modern Zunyi, Guizhou) – so that a route for a potential back-stabbing attack on Nanyue could be made. The Han ambassador Tang Meng (唐蒙) was able to secure the submission of these tribal kingdoms by giving their kings gifts; Emperor Wu established the Commandery of Jianwei (犍为, headquarters in modern Yibin, Sichuan) to govern over the tribes, but eventually abandoned it after being unable to cope with local revolts. Later, after Zhang Qian returned from the western region, part of his report indicated that embassies could more easily reach Shendu (India) and Anxi (Parthia) by going through the south-western kingdoms. Encouraged by the report, Emperor Wu sent ambassadors in 122 BC to try to persuade Yelang and Dian (modern eastern Yunnan) into submission again.

==Religion==
Han Gaozu, founder of the Han dynasty, had installed shaman cultists from the area of the former state of Jin (in the area of the modern province of Shanxi) as official religious functionaries of his new empire. Emperor Wu worshiped the divinity Tai Yi (or, Dong Huang Tai Yi), a deity to whom he was introduced by his shaman advisers, who were able to provide him with the experience of having this god (and other spiritual entities, such as the Master of Fate, Si Ming) summoned into his presence; the emperor even went so far as to construct a &quot;House of Life&quot; (&quot;shou gong&quot;) chapel at his Ganquan palace complex (in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) specifically for this purpose, in 118 BC. One of the religious rituals that Emperor Wu organized was the Suburban Sacrifice, and the nineteen hymns entitled &quot;Hymns for Use in the Suburban Sacrifice&quot; were written in connection with these religious rites and published during Wu&#x27;s reign.

It was also during this time that Emperor Wu began to show a fascination with immortality. He began to associate with magicians who claimed to be able to, if they could find the proper ingredients, create divine pills that would confer immortality. However, he himself punished others&#x27; use of magic severely. In 130 BC, for example, when the witch Chu Fu tried to approach Empress Chen to teach her sorcery and love spells to curse Consort Wei and regain Emperor Wu&#x27;s affections, he dispatched Zhang Tang to execute Chu Fu for witchcraft, which was illegal at the time.

==Despotism at home==

Around the same time, perhaps as a sign of what would come to be, Emperor Wu began to trust governing officials who were harsh in their punishment, believing that such harshness would be the most effective method to maintain social order and so placing these officials in power. For example, one such official, Yi Zong (义纵), became the governor of the Commandery of Dingxiang (part of modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) and executed 200 prisoners, even though they had not committed capital crimes; he then executed their friends who happened to have been visiting. In 122 BC, Liu An, the Prince of Huainan (a previously trusted adviser of Emperor Wu, and closely enough related to have imperial pretensions) and his brother Liu Ci (刘赐), the Prince of Hengshan, were accused of plotting treason. They committed suicide; their families and many alleged co-conspirators were executed. Similar action was taken against the other vassal Princes, and by the end of the reign, all the vassal kingdoms had been political and militarily disabled.

A famous wrongful execution happened in 117 BC, when the minister of agriculture Yan Yi (颜异), was falsely accused of committing a crime, though he was actually targeted because he had previously offended the emperor by opposing a plan to effectively extort double tributes out of princes and marquesses. Yan was executed for &quot;internal defamation&quot; of the emperor, and this caused the officials to be fearful and willing to flatter the emperor.

===Further territorial expansion, old age, and paranoia===

Starting about 113 BC, Emperor Wu began to display further signs of abusing his power. He began to incessantly tour the commanderies, initially nearby Chang&#x27;an, but later extending to much farther places, worshipping the various gods on the way, perhaps again in search of immortality. He also had a succession of magicians whom he honoured with great things. In one case, he even made one a marquess and married his daughter, the Eldest Princess Wei, to him; that magician, Luan Da, was later exposed as a fraud and executed. Emperor Wu&#x27;s expenditures on these tours and magical adventures put a great strain on the national treasury and caused difficulties on the locales that he visited, twice causing the governors of commanderies to commit suicide after they were unable to supply the emperor&#x27;s entire train.
In 112 BC, a crisis in the Kingdom of Nanyue (modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam) erupted, leading to military intervention. At that time, the King Zhao Xing and his mother Queen Dowager Jiu (樛太后) – a Chinese woman whom Zhao Xing&#x27;s father Zhao Yingqi had married while he served as an ambassador to Han – were both in favor of becoming incorporated into Han. This was opposed by the senior prime minister, Lü Jia (吕嘉), who wanted to maintain the kingdom&#x27;s independence. Queen Dowager Jiu tried to goad the Chinese ambassadors into killing Lü, but the Chinese ambassadors were hesitant to do so. When Emperor Wu sent a 2,000-man force led by Han Qianqiu (韩千秋) and Queen Dowager Jiu&#x27;s brother Jiu Le (樛乐) to try to assist the king and the queen dowager, Lü staged a coup d&#x27;état and had the king and the queen dowager killed. Lü then made another son of Zhao Yingqi, Zhao Jiande, king and went on to annihilate the Han forces under Han and Jiu. Several months later, Emperor Wu commissioned a five-pronged attack against Nanyue. In 111 BC, the Han forces captured the Nanyue capital Panyu (番禺, modern Guangzhou ) and annexed the entire Nanyue territory into Han, establishing ten commanderies.

That same year, one of the co-kings of Minyue (modern Fujian), Luo Yushan, was fearful that Han would attack his kingdom next and made a pre-emptive attack against Han, capturing a number of towns in former Nanyue and in the other border commanderies. In 110 BC, under Han military pressure, Luo Yushan&#x27;s co-king Luo Jugu (骆居古) assassinated him and surrendered the kingdom to Han. However, Emperor Wu did not establish commanderies in Minyue&#x27;s former territory; instead, he moved its people to the region between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers.

Later that year, Emperor Wu, at great expense, carried out the ancient ceremony of the Feng and Shan sacrifices &quot;fengshan&quot; (封禅) at Mount Tai; this involved the worship of heaven and earth and presumably a secret petition to the gods of heaven and earth to seek immortality. He then decreed that he would return to Mount Tai every five years to repeat the ceremony, but only did so once in 98 BC. Many palaces were built for him and the princes to accommodate the anticipated cycles of the ceremony.

It was around this time that, in reaction to the large expenditures by Emperor Wu that had exhausted the national treasury, his agricultural minister Sang Hongyang conceived of a plan that many dynasties would repeat later: creating national monopolies for salt and iron. The national treasury would further purchase other consumer goods when the prices were low and sell them when the prices were high at profit, thus replenishing the treasury while at the same time making sure the price fluctuation would not be too great.

In 109 BC, Emperor Wu started yet another territorial expansion campaign. Nearly a century earlier, a Chinese General named Wiman had taken the throne of Gojoseon and had established Wiman Joseon at Wanggeom-seong, (modern Pyongyang), which became a nominal Han vassal. When Wiman&#x27;s grandson King Ugeo refused to permit Jin&#x27;s ambassadors to reach China through his territories, Emperor Wei sent an ambassador She He (涉何) to Wanggeom to negotiate a right of passage with King Ugeo, but King Ugeo refused and had a general escort She back to Han territory. When they got close to Han borders, She assassinated the general and claimed to Emperor Wu that he had defeated Joseon in battle. Emperor Wu, unaware of his deception, made him the military commander of the Commandery of Liaodong (modern central Liaoning). King Ugeo, offended, made a raid on Liaodong and killed She. In response, Emperor Wu commissioned a two-pronged attack (one by land and one by sea) against Joseon. Initially, Joseon offered to become a vassal, but peace negotiations broke down by the Chinese forces&#x27; refusal to let a Joseon force escort its crown prince to Chang&#x27;an to pay tribute to Emperor Wu. Han took over the Joseon lands in 108 BC and established four commanderies.

Also in 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent an expeditionary force against the Kingdom of Dian (modern eastern Yunnan), planning on conquering it. When the King of Dian surrendered, it was incorporated into Han territory with the King of Dian being permitted to keep his traditional authority and title. Emperor Wu established five commanderies over Dian and the other nearby kingdoms.

In 108 BC, Emperor Wu sent general Zhao Ponu (赵破奴) on a campaign to Xiyu, and he forced the Kingdoms of Loulan on northeast border of the Taklamakan Desert and Cheshi (modern Turpan region, Xinjiang) into submission. In 105 BC, Emperor Wu gave a princess from a remote collateral imperial line to Kunmo (昆莫), the King of Wusun (Issyk Kol basin) in marriage, and she later married his grandson and successor Qinqu (芩娶), creating a strong and stable alliance between Han and Wusun. The various Xiyu kingdoms also strengthened their relationships with Han. An infamous Han war against the nearby Kingdom of Dayuan (Kokand) erupted in 104 BC. Dayuan refused to give in to Emperor Wu&#x27;s commands to surrender its best horses, Emperor Wu&#x27;s ambassadors were then executed when they insulted the King of Dayuan after his refusal. Emperor Wu commissioned Li Guangli, the brother of concubine Lady Li, as a general to direct the war against Dayuan. In 103 BC, Li Guangli&#x27;s army of 26,000 men (20,000 Chinese and 6,000 steppe cavalry), without adequate supplies, suffered a humiliating loss against Dayuan, but in 102 BC, Li with a new army of 60,000 men, was able to put a devastating siege on its capital by cutting off water supplies to the city, forcing Dayuan&#x27;s surrender 3,000 of its prized horses. This Han victory further intimidated the Xiyu kingdoms into submission.
Emperor Wu also made attempts to try to intimidate Xiongnu into submission, but even though peace negotiations were ongoing, Xiongnu never actually submitted to becoming a Han vassal during Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign. In 103 BC, Chanyu Er surrounded Zhao Ponu and captured his entire army – the first major Xiongnu victory since Wei Qing and Huo Qubing nearly captured the chanyu in 119 BC. Following Han&#x27;s victory over Dayuan in 102 BC, however, Xiongnu became concerned that Han could then concentrate against it, and made peace overtures. Peace negotiations failed when the Han deputy ambassador Zhang Sheng (张胜) was discovered to have conspired to assassinate Chanyu Qiedihou (且鞮侯). The ambassador, the later-famed Su Wu, would be detained for two decades. In 99 BC, Emperor Wu commissioned another expedition force aimed at crushing Xiongnu, but both prongs of the expedition force failed. Li Guangli&#x27;s force became trapped but was able to free itself and withdraw, while Li Ling, Li Guang&#x27;s grandson, surrendered at the end after being surrounded by Xiongnu forces. One year later, receiving a report that Li Ling was training Xiongnu soldiers, Emperor Wu had Li&#x27;s clan executed.

Moreover, Emperor Wu already bore a grudge against the famed historian Sima Qian because Sima&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; was not as flattering to Emperor Wu and his father Emperor Jing as Emperor Wu wanted, so Emperor Wu had Sima Qian castrated.

In 106 BC, in order to further better organize the territories, including both the previously existing empire and the newly conquered territories, Emperor Wu divided the empire into 13 prefectures (&quot;zhou&quot;, 州), but without governors or prefectural governments. Rather, he assigned a supervisor to each prefecture, who would visit the commanderies and principalities in the prefecture on a rotating basis to investigate corruption and disobedience with imperial edicts.

In 104 BC, Emperor Wu built the luxurious Jianzhang Palace (建章宮) – a massive structure that was intended to make him closer to the gods. He later resided at that palace exclusively, rather than the traditional Weiyang Palace, which Xiao He had built during the reign of Emperor Gao.

Wu (156–87 BC) collected &quot;min qian&quot; (a form of business tax) from merchants, businessmen, and handicraftsmen.

About 100 BC, due to the heavy taxation and military burdens imposed by Emperor Wu&#x27;s incessant military campaigns and luxurious spending, there were many peasant revolts throughout the empire. Emperor Wu issued an edict that was intended to suppress the peasant revolts: he made officials whose commanderies saw unsuppressed peasant revolts liable with their lives. However, this edict had the exact opposite effect, since it became impossible to suppress all of the revolts, officials would merely cover up the existence of the revolts. He executed many people who made fake coins.

In 96 BC, a series of witchcraft persecutions began. Emperor Wu, who was paranoid over a nightmare of being whipped by tiny stick-wielding puppets and a sighting of a traceless assassin (possibly a hallucination), ordered extensive investigations with harsh punishments. Large numbers of people, many of them high officials, were accused of witchcraft and executed, usually along with their entire clans. The first trial began with Empress Wei Zifu&#x27;s elder brother-in-law Gongsun He (公孫賀, the Prime Minister at the time) and his son Gongsun Jingsheng (公孫敬聲, also an imperial official, but arrested under corruption charges), quickly leading to the execution of their entire clan. Also caught in this disaster were Crown Prince Ju&#x27;s two elder sisters Princess Yangshi (陽石公主, who was said to have a romantic relationship with her cousin Gongsun Jingsheng) and Princess Zhuyi (諸邑公主), as well as his cousin Wei Kang (衛伉, the eldest son of the deceased general Wei Qing), who were all accused of witchcraft and executed in 91 BC. These witchcraft persecutions later became intertwined in succession struggles and erupted into a major catastrophe.

===Crown Prince Ju&#x27;s revolt===
In 94 BC, Emperor Wu&#x27;s youngest son Liu Fuling was born to a favorite concubine of his, Lady Gouyi (Consort Zhao). Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at such an advanced age (62 years old), and because Consort Zhao purportedly had a pregnancy that lasted 14 months (the same as the mythical Emperor Yao), he named Consort Zhao&#x27;s palace gate &quot;Gate of Yao&#x27;s mother.&quot; This led to speculation that the emperor, due to his favor of Consort Zhao and Prince Fuling, wanted to make Liu Fuling the crown prince instead. While there was no evidence that he actually intended to do anything as such, over the next few years, conspiracies against Crown Prince Ju and his mother Empress Wei arose that were inspired by such rumors.

Up to this point, there had been a cordial but somehow fragile relationship between Emperor Wu and his crown prince, who perhaps was not as ambitious as his father wished. As he grew older, the Emperor came to be less attracted to Ju&#x27;s mother, Empress Wei Zifu, though he continued to respect her and she had such absolute power over palace affairs that Emperor Wu did not ask for any report from Empress Wei, contrary to the custom and law that emperors asked empresses to report on important actions regarding the house and the royal family once every five days. When he left the capital, the Emperor would delegate authority to Crown Prince Ju. Eventually, however, the two began to have disagreements over policy, with Ju favoring leniency and Wu&#x27;s advisers (harsh and sometimes corrupt officials) urging the opposite. After Wei Qing&#x27;s death in 106 BC and Gongsun He&#x27;s execution, Prince Ju had no strong allies left in the government. The other officials then began to publicly defame and plot against him. Meanwhile, Emperor Wu was becoming more and more isolated, spending time with young concubines, often remaining unavailable to Ju or Wei.

Conspirators against Prince Ju included Jiang Chong (江充), the newly appointed head of secret intelligence, who had once had a run-in with Ju after arresting one of his assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. Another conspirator was Su Wen (蘇文), chief eunuch in charge of caring for imperial concubines, who had previously made false accusations against Ju, claiming he was joyful over Wu&#x27;s illness and had an adulterous relationship with one of the junior concubines.

Jiang and others made many accusations of witchcraft against important people in the Han court. Jiang and Su decided to use witchcraft as the excuse to move against Prince Ju himself. With approval from Emperor Wu who was then at the Ganquan Palace, Jiang searched through various palaces, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Prince Ju&#x27;s and Empress Wei&#x27;s palace. While completely trashing the palaces up with intensive digging, he secretly planted witchery dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writings. He then announced that he had found the items there during the search. Prince Ju was shocked, knowing that he was framed. His teacher Shi De (石德), invoking the story of Ying Fusu of the Qin dynasty and raised the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be dead, suggesting that Prince Ju start an uprising to fight the conspirators. Prince Ju initially hesitated, wanting to speed to Ganquan Palace to defend himself before his father. But, when he found out that Jiang&#x27;s messengers were already on their way, he decided to follow Shi&#x27;s suggestion.

Prince Ju sent an individual to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu to lure and arrest Jiang and the other conspirators. Su escaped, but Ju accused Jiang of sabotaging his relationship with his father, and personally killed Jiang. With the support of his mother, Ju enlisted his guards, civilians, and prisoners in preparation to defend him.

Su fled to Ganquan Palace and accused Prince Ju of treason. Emperor Wu, not believing it to be true and correctly (at this point) believing that Prince Ju had merely been angry at Jiang, sent a messenger back to Chang&#x27;an to summon Prince Ju. The messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang&#x27;an, but instead returned and gave Emperor Wu the false report that Prince Ju was conducting a coup. Enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (刘屈犛), to put down the rebellion.

The two sides battled in the streets of Chang&#x27;an for five days, but Liu Qumao&#x27;s forces prevailed after it became clear that Prince Ju did not have his father&#x27;s authorization. Prince Ju was forced to flee the capital following the defeat, accompanied only by two of his sons and some personal guards. Apart from a grandson Liu Bingyi, who was barely a month old and thrown into prison, all other members of his family were left behind and killed. His mother, Empress Wei, committed suicide when Emperor Wu sent officials to depose her. Their bodies were carelessly buried in fields without proper tomb markings. Prince Ju&#x27;s supporters were brutally cracked down on and civilians aiding the crown prince were exiled. Even Tian Ren (田仁), an official city gatekeeper who did not stop Prince Ju&#x27;s escape, and Ren An (任安), an army commander who chose not to actively participate in the crackdown, were accused of being sympathizers and executed.

Emperor Wu continued to be enraged and ordered that Prince Ju be tracked down. After a junior official, Linghu Mao (令狐茂), risked his life to speak on Prince Ju&#x27;s behalf, Emperor Wu&#x27;s anger began to subside. However, he waited to issue a pardon for Prince Ju.

Prince Ju fled to Hu County (湖縣, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and took refuge in the home of a poor peasant family. Knowing that their good-hearted hosts could never afford the daily expenditure of so many people, the Prince sought help from an old friend who lived nearby. However, this move exposed their whereabouts, and he was soon tracked down by local officials eager for a reward. Surrounded by troops and seeing no chance of escape, the Prince hung himself. His two sons and the family housing them died with him after the government soldiers eventually broke into the yard and killed everyone. The two local officials who led the raid, Zhang Fuchang (張富昌) and Li Shou (李寿), wasted no time in taking the Prince&#x27;s body to Chang&#x27;an to claim a reward from the emperor. Emperor Wu, although greatly saddened to hear the death of his son, had to keep his promise and rewarded the officials.

===Late reign and death===

Even after Jiang Chong and Prince Ju both died, the witchhunt continued and combined with Wei Zifu&#x27;s jealousy led to the execution of the Li family on accounts of treason. General Li Guangli caused unnecessary losses with his military incompetence. In 90 BC, while Li was assigned to a campaign against Xiongnu, a eunuch named Guo Rang (郭穰) exposed how Li and his political ally, Prime Minister Liu Qumao, were conspiring to use witchcraft on Emperor Wu. Liu and his family were immediately arrested and later executed. Li&#x27;s family was also taken into custody and later executed after the traitor Li Ling also defected to the Xiongnu. Li, after learning the news, used risky tactics to attempt a standoff against Emperor Wu, but failed when some of his senior officers mutinied. On his retreat, he was ambushed by Xiongnu forces. He defected to Xiongnu and Emperor Wu executed the Li clan for treason soon after. Even within the Xiongnu, Li himself also fought with other Han traitors, especially Wei Lü (衛律), who was extremely jealous of the amount of Chanyu&#x27;s favor that Li gained as a new, high-profile defector.

By this time, Emperor Wu realized that the witchcraft accusations were often false accusations, especially in relation to the crown prince rebellion. In 92 BC, when Tian Qianqiu, then the superintendent of Emperor Gao&#x27;s temple, wrote a report claiming that Emperor Gao told him in a dream that Prince Ju should have only been whipped at most, not killed, Emperor Wu had a revelation about what had led to his son&#x27;s rebellion. He had Su burned and Jiang&#x27;s family executed. He also made Tian prime minister. Although he claimed to miss Prince Ju greatly (he even built a palace and an altar for his deceased son as a sign of grief and regret), he did not at this time rectify the situation where Prince Ju&#x27;s only surviving progeny, Liu Bingyi, languished in prison as a child.

With the political scene greatly changed, Emperor Wu publicly apologized to the whole nation about his past policy mistakes, a gesture known to history as the Repenting Edict of Luntai (輪台悔詔). The Prime Minister Tian he appointed was in favor of retiring the troops and easing hardships on the people. Tian also promoted agriculture, with several agricultural experts becoming important members of the administration. Wars and territorial expansion generally ceased. These policies and ideals were those supported by Crown Prince Ju, and were finally realised years after his death.
By 88 BC, Emperor Wu had become seriously ill. With Prince Ju dead, there was no clear heir. Liu Dan, the Prince of Yan, was Emperor Wu&#x27;s oldest surviving son, but Emperor Wu considered both him and his younger brother Liu Xu, the Prince of Guangling, to be unsuitable, since neither respected laws. He decided that the only suitable heir was his youngest son, Liu Fuling, who was only six at that time. He therefore also chose a potential regent in Huo Guang, whom he considered to be capable and faithful, and entrusted Huo with the regency of Fuling. Emperor Wu also ordered the execution of Prince Fuling&#x27;s mother Consort Zhao, out of fear that she would become an uncontrollable empress dowager with full power like the previous Empress Lü. At Huo&#x27;s suggestion, he made ethnic Xiongnu official Jin Midi and general Shangguang Jie co-regents. He died in 87 BC, shortly after making Prince Fuling crown prince. Crown Prince Fuling then succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhao for the next 13 years.

Empress Chen Jiao and Empress Wei Zifu were the only two empresses during Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign. Emperor Wu did not make anyone empress after Empress Wei Zifu committed suicide, and he left no instruction on who should be enshrined in his temple with him. He lies buried in the Maoling mound, the most famous of the so-called Chinese pyramids. Huo Guang sent 500 beautiful women there for the dead emperor. According to folk legend, 200 of them were executed for having sex with the guards. Huo&#x27;s clan was later killed and the emperor&#x27;s tomb was looted by Chimei.

==Legacy==
Historians have treated Emperor Wu with ambivalence, and there are certainly some contradictory accounts of his life. He roughly doubled the size of the Han empire of China during his reign, and much of the territory that he annexed is now part of modern China. He officially promoted Confucianism, yet just like Qin Shi Huang, he personally used a legalist system of rewards and punishments to govern his empire.

Emperor Wu is said to have been extravagant and superstitious, allowing his policies to become a burden on his people. As such he is often compared to Qin Shi Huang. The punishments for perceived failures and disloyalty were often exceedingly harsh. His father saved many participants of Rebellion of the Seven States from execution, and made some work in constructing his tomb. Emperor Wu had killed thousands of people and their families over the Liu An affair, Hengshan, his prosecution of witchcraft, and the Prince Ju revolt.

He used some of his wives&#x27; relatives to fight Xiongnu, some of whom become successful and famous generals. There is evidence to suggest that the two of them, Wei Qing and Huo Qubin, may have been his lovers. Wei Qing was buried in the Emperor&#x27;s mausoleum.

He forced his last queen to commit suicide. His lover, Han Yuan, whom he had known since childhood, was executed on the Queen Dowager&#x27;s orders for having an affair with a palace maid. Out of the twelve prime ministers appointed by Emperor Wu, three were executed and two committed suicide while holding the post; another was executed in retirement. He set up many special prisons (詔獄) and incarcerated nearly two hundred thousand individuals in them.

Emperor Wu&#x27;s political reform resulted in the strengthening of the Emperor&#x27;s power at expense of the prime minister&#x27;s authority. The post of &quot;Shangshu&quot; (court secretaries) was elevated from merely managing documents to that of the Emperor&#x27;s close advisor, and it stayed this way until the end of the imperial era.

In 140 BC, Emperor Wu conducted an imperial examination of over 100 young scholars. Having been recommended by officials, most of the scholars were commoners with no noble background. This event would have a major impact on Chinese history, marking the official start of the establishment of Confucianism as official imperial doctrine. This came about because a young Confucian scholar, Dong Zhongshu, was evaluated to have submitted the best essay in which he advocated the establishment of Confucianism. It is unclear whether Emperor Wu, in his young age, actually determined this, or whether this was the result of machinations of the prime minister Wei Wan (衛綰), who was himself a Confucian. However, the fact that several other young scholars who scored highly on the examination (but not Dong) later became trusted advisors for Emperor Wu would appear to suggest that Emperor Wu himself at least had some actual participation.

In 136 BC, Emperor Wu founded what became the Imperial University, a college for classical scholars that supplied the Han&#x27;s need for well-trained bureaucrats.

==Poetry==
Various important aspects of Han poetry are associated with Emperor Wu and his court, including his direct interest in poetry and patronage of poets. Emperor Wu was also a patron of literature, with a number of poems being attributed to him. As to the poetry on lost love, some of the pieces attributed to him are considered of well-done, there is some question to their actual authorship.

The following work is on the death of one of his concubines:
Emperor Wu facilitated a revival of interest in Chu ci, the poetry of and in the style of the area of the former Chu kingdom during the early part of his reign, in part because of his near relative Liu An. Some of this Chu material was later anthologized in the &quot;Chu Ci&quot;.

The &quot;Chuci&quot; genre of poetry from its origin was linked with Chu shamanism, and Han Wudi both supported the Chu genre of poetry in the earlier years of his reign, and also continued to support shamanically linked poetry during the later years of his reign.

Emperor Wu employed poets and musicians in writing lyrics and scoring tunes for various performances and also patronized choreographers and shamans in this same connection for arranging the dance movements and coordinating the spiritual and the mundane. He was quite fond of the resulting lavish ritual performances, especially night time rituals where the multitudinous singers, musicians, and dancers would perform in the brilliant lighting provided by of thousands of torches.

The &quot;fu&quot; style typical of Han poetry also took shape during the reign of Emperor Wu in his court, with poet and official Sima Xiangru as a leading figure. However, Sima&#x27;s initial interest in the &quot;chu ci&quot; style later gave way to his interest in more innovative forms of poetry. After his patronage of poets familiar with the &quot;Chu ci&quot; style in the early part of his reign, Emperor Wu later seems to have turned his interest and his court&#x27;s interest to other literary fashions.

Another of Emperor Wu&#x27;s major contribution to poetry was through his organization of the Imperial Music Bureau (&quot;yuefu&quot;) as part of the official governmental bureaucratic apparatus: the Music Bureau was charged with matters related to music and poetry, as lyrics are a part of music and traditional Chinese poetry was considered to have been chanted or sung, rather than spoken or recited as prose. The Music Bureau greatly flourished during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, who has been widely cited to have founded the Music Bureau in 120 BC.

However, it seems more likely that there was already a long-standing office of music and that Emperor Wu enlarged its size as part of his governmental reorganization, changing its scope and function and possibly renaming it and thus seeming to have established a new institution. The stated tasks of this institution were apparently to collect popular songs from different and adapt and orchestrate these, as well as to develop new material. Emperor Wu&#x27;s Music Bureau not only collected folk songs and ballads from where they originated throughout the country, but also collected songs reportedly based on Central Asian tunes or melodies, with new lyrics which were written to harmonize with the existing tunes, and characterized by varying line lengths and the incorporation of various nonce words. In any case, he is widely held to have used the Music Bureau as an important part of his religious innovations and to have specifically commissioned Sima Xiangru to write poetry. Because of the development and transmission of a particular style of poetry by the Music Bureau, this style of poetry has become known as the &quot;Music Bureau&quot; style, or &quot;yuefu&quot; (and also in its later development referred to as &quot;new &quot;yuefu&quot;&quot;, &quot;imitation&quot;, or &quot;literary &quot;yüeh-fu&quot;&quot;).

==Cultural depictions==
Emperor Wu is one of the most famous emperors of ancient China and has made appearances in quite a lot of Chinese television dramas, examples include:
* &quot;The Prince of Han Dynasty&quot;
* &quot;The Emperor in Han Dynasty&quot;
* &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Rival in Palace&quot;
* &quot;The Virtuous Queen of Han&quot;

Emperor Wu is also a major character in Carole Wilkinson&#x27;s novel &quot;Dragonkeeper&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Garden of the Purple Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dragon Moon&quot;. The three novels, which center on the journeys of a former slave girl and the dragons in her care, loosely depict the first years of Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign and includes a number of references to his quest for immortality.

<text>Mount Aenos or Ainos (Ancient Greek: &quot; Ὄρος Αἶνος&quot;; Modern Greek: &quot; Όρος Αίνος&quot;; Italian: &quot;Monte Nero&quot; or &quot;Montagna Nera&quot;) is the tallest mountain on the Ionian island of Cephalonia, Greece, with an elevation of . Its bedrock is predominantly dolomite and limestone of Cretaceous age.

Most of the mountain range is designated as a National Park area and is covered with Greek fir (&quot;Abies cephalonica&quot;) and black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;). Pine forests are found between the elevations of . Semi-wild ponies inhabit its forest. On clear days, the view includes the northwest Peloponnese and Aetolia along with the islands of Zakynthos, Lefkada, and Ithaca.

No ski resorts are found on this mountain range, but there are beautiful caves to be seen in the north. A highway passing over the mountain range connecting traffic from southwestern to the eastern part of the island is one of the few roads going into the mountain range. Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people live on the slopes of Ainos. Multiple television and cellphone relay towers occupy the summit.

==Walking Route==

The easiest way to get to the summit is to drive along the Mt Ainos road from the North West to the transmitter station. Leave your car here and then continue along the dirt track on foot for about 10 minutes until you reach some steps to the right and a sign post. Go up these steps for another 10 minutes to reach the summit. A concrete post at the summit has a metal container strapped to it, this contains a visitor book.

A more strenuous walk is the well maintained and signposted route from Digaleto, on the road from Sami to Poros. Drive, or walk, along the road heading West, signposted to Ainos/Einos. The official walk starts at a quarry, about 1 km out of the village. Walk through the quarry and follow the signs containing a white square on a yellow background (some of these signs are a little rusty and appear to be red, or will have fallen down but the pathway is quite obvious). All the major junctions have a map and most have shaded rest areas. Much of the walk is below the tree line and can be cool even in the summer, there are occasional view points along the route. The climb is 1096 metres and the length is 6.5 km.

<doc id="339102" wikidata="Q15419395" url="?curid=339102" title="Top-down parsing">
<text>Top-down parsing in computer science is a parsing strategy where one first looks at the highest level of the parse tree and works down the parse tree by using the rewriting rules of a formal grammar. LL parsers are a type of parser that uses a top-down parsing strategy.

Top-down parsing is a strategy of analyzing unknown data relationships by hypothesizing general parse tree structures and then considering whether the known fundamental structures are compatible with the hypothesis. It occurs in the analysis of both natural languages and computer languages.

Top-down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for parse-trees using a top-down expansion of the given formal grammar rules. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate ambiguity by expanding all alternative right-hand-sides of grammar rules.

Simple implementations of top-down parsing do not terminate for left-recursive grammars, and top-down parsing with backtracking may have exponential time complexity with respect to the length of the input for ambiguous CFGs. However, more sophisticated top-down parsers have been created by Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan, which do accommodate ambiguity and left recursion in polynomial time and which generate polynomial-sized representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees.

==Programming language application==
A compiler parses input from a programming language to an internal representation by matching the incoming symbols to production rules. Production rules are commonly defined using Backus–Naur form. An LL parser is a type of parser that does top-down parsing by applying each production rule to the incoming symbols, working from the left-most symbol yielded on a production rule and then proceeding to the next production rule for each non-terminal symbol encountered. In this way the parsing starts on the Left of the result side (right side) of the production rule and evaluates non-terminals from the Left first and, thus, proceeds down the parse tree for each new non-terminal before continuing to the next symbol for a production rule.

For example:

* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3

which produces the string &quot;A&quot;=&quot;acdf&quot;

would match formula_1 and attempt to match formula_2 next. Then formula_3 would be tried. As one may expect, some languages are more ambiguous than others. For a non-ambiguous language, in which all productions for a non-terminal produce distinct strings, the string produced by one production will not start with the same symbol as the string produced by another production. A non-ambiguous language may be parsed by an LL(1) grammar where the (1) signifies the parser reads ahead one token at a time. For an ambiguous language to be parsed by an LL parser, the parser must lookahead more than 1 symbol, e.g. LL(3).

The common solution to this problem is to use an LR parser, which is a type of shift-reduce parser, and does bottom-up parsing.

== Accommodating left recursion in top-down parsing ==
A formal grammar that contains left recursion cannot be parsed by a naive recursive descent parser unless they are converted to a weakly equivalent right-recursive form. However, recent research demonstrates that it is possible to accommodate left-recursive grammars (along with all other forms of general CFGs) in a more sophisticated top-down parser by use of curtailment. A recognition algorithm that accommodates ambiguous grammars and curtails an ever-growing direct left-recursive parse by imposing depth restrictions with respect to input length and current input position, is described by Frost and Hafiz in 2006. That algorithm was extended to a complete parsing algorithm to accommodate indirect (by comparing previously computed context with current context) as well as direct left-recursion in polynomial time, and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007. The algorithm has since been implemented as a set of parser combinators written in the Haskell programming language. The implementation details of these new set of combinators can be found in a paper by the authors, which was presented in PADL&#x27;08.
The X-SAIGA site has more about the algorithms and implementation details.

Additionally, one may use a Graph-structured stack (GSS) in addition to the aforementioned curtailment in order to accommodate left recursion by &#x27;merging&#x27; stacks with common prefixes and by preventing infinite recursion, thereby reducing the number and contents of each stack, thereby reducing the time and space complexity of the parser. This leads to an algorithm known as Generalized LL parsing, in which you use a GSS, left-recursion curtailment, and an LL(k) parser to parse input strings relative to a given CFG.

== Time and space complexity of top-down parsing ==
When top-down parser tries to parse an ambiguous input with respect to an ambiguous CFG, it may need exponential number of steps (with respect to the length of the input) to try all alternatives of the CFG in order to produce all possible parse trees, which eventually would require exponential memory space. The problem of exponential time complexity in top-down parsers constructed as sets of mutually recursive functions has been solved by Norvig in 1991. His technique is similar to the use of dynamic programming and state-sets in Earley&#x27;s algorithm (1970), and tables in the CYK algorithm of Cocke, Younger and Kasami.

The key idea is to store results of applying a parser codice_1 at position codice_2 in a memorable and to reuse results whenever the same situation arises. Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan also use memoization for refraining redundant computations to accommodate any form of CFG in polynomial time (Θ(n4) for left-recursive grammars and Θ(n3) for non left-recursive grammars). Their top-down parsing algorithm also requires polynomial space for potentially exponential ambiguous parse trees by &#x27;compact representation&#x27; and &#x27;local ambiguities grouping&#x27;. Their compact representation is comparable with Tomita&#x27;s compact representation of bottom-up parsing.

Using PEG&#x27;s, another representation of grammars, packrat parsers provide an elegant and powerful parsing algorithm. See Parsing expression grammar.

<text>robotfindskitten (rfk) is a &quot;Zen simulation&quot;, originally written by Leonard Richardson for MS-DOS.

==Game==
It is a free video game with an ASCII interface in which the user (playing the eponymous robot and represented by a number sign &quot;&quot;) must find kitten (represented by a random character) on a field of other random characters. Walking up to items allows robot to identify them as either kitten, or any of a variety of &quot;Non-kitten Items&quot; (NKIs) with whimsical, strange or simply random text descriptions. It is not possible to lose (though there is a patch that adds a 1 in 10 probability of the NKI killing robot). Simon Carless has characterized &quot;robotfindskitten&quot; as &quot;less a game and more a way of life ... It&#x27;s fun to wander around until you find a kitten, at which point you feel happy and can start again&quot;.

The original &quot;robotfindskitten&quot; program was the sole entrant to a contest in 1997 at the now-defunct webzine &quot;Nerth Pork&quot; — the object: create a depiction of &quot;robotfindskitten&quot;. (The &quot;robotfindskitten&quot; concept was originally created by Jacob Berendes, but the only submission he received depicted kittens meeting an untimely end at the hands of malevolent robots.)

When the author rewrote the program for Linux in 1999, it gained popularity and now has its own website and mailing lists. Since then, it has been ported to and/or implemented on over 30 platforms, including POSIX, the Dreamcast, Palm OS, TI-99/4A, the Z-machine, the Sony PSP, Android, and many more. Graphical versions, such as an OpenGL version with emblazoned on an otherwise featureless cube, also exist. Remakes of it are also used as programming tutorials, such as for Gambas.

<doc id="339110" wikidata="Q2394424" url="?curid=339110" title="Bulat steel">
<text>Bulat is a type of steel alloy known in Russia from medieval times; it was regularly mentioned in Russian legends as the material of choice for cold steel. The name &#x27; is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word&#x27;, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan. Bulat steel is generally agreed to be a Russian name for wootz steel, the production method of which has been lost for centuries, and the bulat steel used today makes use of a more recently developed technique.

==History==
The secret of bulat manufacturing had been lost by the beginning of the 19th century. It is known that the process involved dipping the finished weapon into a vat containing a special liquid of which spiny restharrow extract was a part (the plant&#x27;s name in Russian, &quot;&quot;, reflects its historical role), then holding the sword aloft while galloping on a horse, allowing it to dry and harden against the wind.

Pavel Anosov eventually managed to duplicate the qualities of that metal in 1838, when he completed ten years of study into the nature of Damascus steel swords.

Anosov had entered the Saint Petersburg Mine Cadet School in 1810, where a Damascus steel sword was stored in a display case. He became enchanted with the sword, and was filled with stories of them slashing through their European counterparts. In November 1817, he was sent to the factories of Zlatoust mining region in the southern Urals, where he was soon promoted to the inspector of the &quot;weapon decoration department&quot;.

Here he again came into contact with Damascus steel of European origin (which was in fact pattern welded steel, and not at all similar), but quickly found that this steel was quite inferior to the original forged in the Middle East from wootz steel from India. Anosov had been working with various quenching techniques, and decided to attempt to duplicate Damascus steel with quenching. He eventually developed a methodology that greatly increased the hardness of his steels.

Bulat became popular in cannon manufacturing, until the Bessemer process was able to make the same quality steels for far less money.

==Structure==
Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.

Cementite is essentially a ceramic, which accounts for the sharpness of Damascus (and bulat) steel. Cementite is unstable and breaks down between 600 and 1100 °C into ferrite and carbon, so working the hot metal must be done very carefully.

<doc id="339125" wikidata="Q2823346" url="?curid=339125" title="Crucible steel">
<text>Crucible steel is steel made by melting pig iron, cast iron, iron, and sometimes steel, often along with sand, glass, ashes, and other fluxes, in a crucible. Crucible steel was first developed in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE in Southern India and Sri Lanka using the wootz process.

In ancient times, it was not possible to produce very high temperatures with charcoal or coal fires, which were required to melt iron or steel. However, pig iron, having a higher carbon content and thus a lower melting point, could be melted, and by soaking wrought iron or steel in the liquid pig-iron for a long time, the carbon content of the pig iron could be reduced as it slowly diffused into the iron, turning both into steel. Crucible steel of this type was produced in South and Central Asia during the medieval era.

This generally produced a very hard steel, but also a composite steel that was inhomogeneous, consisting of a very high-carbon steel (formerly the pig-iron) and a lower-carbon steel (formerly the wrought iron). This often resulted in an intricate pattern when the steel was forged, filed or polished, with possibly the most well-known examples coming from the wootz steel used in Damascus swords. The steel was often much higher in carbon content (typically ranging in the area of 1.5 to 2.0%) and in quality (lacking impurities) in comparison with other methods of steel production of the time because of the use of fluxes. The steel was usually worked very little and at relatively low temperatures to avoid any decarburization, hot short crumbling, or excess diffusion of carbon.

With a carbon content close to that of cast iron, it usually required no heat treatment after shaping other than air cooling to achieve the correct hardness, relying on composition alone. The higher-carbon steel provided a very hard edge, but the lower-carbon steel helped to increase the toughness, helping to decrease the chance of chipping, cracking, or breaking.

In Europe, crucible steel was developed by Benjamin Huntsman in England in the 18th century. Huntsman used coke rather than coal or charcoal, achieving temperatures high enough to melt steel and dissolve iron. Huntsman&#x27;s process differed from some of the wootz processes in that it used a longer time to melt the steel and to cool it down and thus allowed more time for the diffusion of carbon. Huntsman&#x27;s process used iron and steel as raw materials, in the form of blister steel, rather than direct conversion from cast iron as in puddling or the later Bessemer process.

The ability to fully melt the steel removed any inhomogeneities in the steel, allowing the carbon to dissolve evenly into the liquid steel and negating the prior need for extensive blacksmithing in an attempt to achieve the same result. Similarly, it allowed steel to be cast by pouring into molds. The use of fluxes allowed nearly complete extraction of impurities from the liquid, which could then simply float to the top for removal. This produced the first steel of modern quality, providing a means of efficiently changing excess wrought iron into useful steel. Huntsman&#x27;s process greatly increased the European output of quality steel suitable for use in items like knives, tools, and machinery, helping to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution.

==Methods of crucible steel production==
Iron alloys are most broadly divided by their carbon content: cast iron has 2–4% carbon impurities; wrought iron oxidizes away most of its carbon, to less than 0.1%. The much more valuable steel has a delicately intermediate carbon fraction, and its material properties range according to the carbon percentage: high carbon steel is stronger but more brittle than low carbon steel. Crucible steel sequesters the raw input materials from the heat source, allowing precise control of carburization (raising) or decarburization (lowering carbon content). Fluxes, such as limestone, could be added to the crucible to remove or promote sulfur, silicon, and other impurities, further altering its material qualities.

Various methods were used to produce crucible steel. According to Islamic texts such as al-Tarsusi and Abu Rayhan Biruni, three methods are described for indirect production of steel. The medieval Islamic historian Abu Rayhan Biruni (c. 973–1050) provides the earliest reference of the production of Damascus steel. The first, and the most common, traditional method is solid state carburization of wrought iron. This is a diffusion process in which wrought iron is packed in crucibles or a hearth with charcoal, then heated to promote diffusion of carbon into the iron to produce steel. Carburization is the basis for the wootz process of steel.
The second method is the decarburization of cast iron by removing carbon from the cast iron.
The third method uses wrought iron and cast iron. In this process, wrought iron and cast iron may be heated together in a crucible to produce steel by fusion. In regard to this method Abu Rayhan Biruni states: &quot;this was the method used in Hearth&quot;. It is proposed that the Indian method refers to Wootz carburization method; i.e., the Mysore or Tamil processes.
Variations of co-fusion process have been found primarily in Persia and Central Asia but have also been found in Hyderabad, India called Deccani or Hyderabad process. For the carbon, a variety of organic materials are specified by the contemporary Islamic authorities, including pomegranate rinds, acorns, fruit skins like orange peel, leaves as well as the white of egg and shells. Slivers of wood are mentioned in some of the Indian sources, but significantly none of the sources mention charcoal.

== Early history ==

Crucible steel is generally attributed to production centres in India and Sri Lanka where it was produced using the so-called &quot;wootz&quot; process, and it is assumed that its appearance in other locations was due to long-distance trade. Only recently it has become apparent that places in Central Asia like Merv in Turkmenistan and Akhsiket in Uzbekistan were important centres of production of crucible steel. The Central Asian finds are all from excavations and date from the 8th to 12th centuries CE, while the Indian/Sri Lankan material is as early as 300 BCE. India&#x27;s iron ore had trace vanadium and other alloying elements leading to increased hardenability in Indian crucible steel which was famous throughout the middle east for its ability to retain an edge.

While crucible steel is more attributed to the Middle East in early times, pattern welded swords, incorporating high-carbon, and likely crucible steel, have been discovered in Europe, from the 3rd century CE, particularly in Scandinavia. Swords bearing the brand name Ulfberht, and dating to a 200-year period from the 9th century to the early 11th century, are prime examples of the technique. It is speculated by many that the process of making these blades originated in the Middle East and subsequently had been traded during the Volga Trade Route days.

In the first centuries of the Islamic period, some scientific studies on swords and steel appeared. The best known of these are by Jabir ibn Hayyan 8th century, al-Kindi 9th century, Al-Biruni in the early 11th century, al-Tarsusi in the late 12th century, and Fakhr-i-Mudabbir 13th century. Any of these contains far more information about Indian and damascene steels than appears in the entire surviving literature of classical Greece and Rome.

There are many ethnographic accounts of Indian crucible steel production; however, scientific investigations of the remains of crucible steel production have only been published for four regions: three in India and one in Sri Lanka. Indian/Sri Lankan crucible steel is commonly referred to as wootz, which is generally agreed to be an English corruption of the word &quot;ukko&quot; (in the Canarese language) or &quot;hookoo&quot; (in the Telugu language).

European accounts from the 17th century onwards have referred to the repute and manufacture of &quot;wootz&quot;, a traditional crucible steel made specially in parts of southern India in the former provinces of Golconda, Mysore and Salem. As yet the scale of excavations and surface surveys is too limited to link the literary accounts to archaeometallurgical evidence.

The proven sites of crucible steel production in south India, e.g. at Konasamudram and Gatihosahalli, date from at least the late medieval period, 16th century. One of the earliest known potential sites, which shows some promising preliminary evidence that may be linked to ferrous crucible processes in Kodumanal, near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. The site is dated between the third century BCE and the third century CE. By the seventeenth century the main centre of crucible steel production seems to have been in Hyderabad. The process was apparently quite different from that recorded elsewhere. Wootz from Hyderabad or the Deccani process for making watered blades involved a co-fusion of two different kinds of iron: one was low in carbon and the other was a high-carbon steel or cast iron. Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel.

Recent archaeological investigations have suggested that Sri Lanka also supported innovative technologies for iron and steel production in antiquity. The Sri Lankan system of crucible steel making was partially independent of the various Indian and Middle Eastern systems. Their method was something similar to the method of carburization of wrought iron. The earliest confirmed crucible steel site is located in the Knuckles range in the northern area of the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka dated to 6th–10th centuries CE. In the twelfth century the land of Serendib (Sri Lanka) seems to have been the main supplier of crucible steel, but over the centuries production slipped back, and by the nineteenth century just a small industry survived in the Balangoda district of the central southern highlands.

A series of excavations at Samanalawewa indicated the unexpected and previously unknown technology of west-facing smelting sites, which are different types of steel production. These furnaces were used for direct smelting to steel. These are named &quot;west facing&quot; because they were located on the western sides of hilltops to use the prevailing wind in the smelting process. Sri Lankan furnace steels were known and traded between the 9th and 11th centuries and earlier, but apparently not later. These sites were dated to the 7th–11th centuries. The coincidence of this dating with the 9th century Islamic reference to Sarandib is of great importance. The crucible process existed in India at the same time that the west- facing technology was operating in Sri Lanka. Excavations of the Yodhawewa (near Mannar) site (in 2018) have uncovered a lower half of a bottom spherical furnace and crucible fragments used to make crucible steel in Sri Lanka during the 7th-8th centuries AD. The crucible fragments uncovered at the site were similar to the elongated tube-shaped crucibles of Samanalawewa.

=== Central Asia ===

Central Asia has a rich history of crucible steel production, beginning during the late 1st millennium CE. From the sites in modern Uzbekistan and Merv in Turkmenistan, there is good archaeological evidence for the large scale production of crucible steel. They all belong in broad terms to the same early medieval period between the late 8th or early 9th and the late 12th century CE, contemporary with the early crusades.

The two most prominent crucible steel sites in eastern Uzbekistan carrying the Ferghana Process are Akhsiket and Pap in the Ferghana Valley, whose position within the Great Silk Road has been historically and archaeologically proved. The material evidence consists of large number of archaeological finds relating to steel making from 9th–12th centuries CE in the form of hundreds of thousands of fragments of crucibles, often with massive slag cakes. Archaeological work at Akhsiket, has identified that the crucible steel process was of the carburization of iron metal. This process appears to be typical of and restricted to the Ferghana Valley in eastern Uzbekistan, and it is therefore called the Ferghana Process. This process lasted in that region for roughly four centuries..

Evidence of the production of crucible steel have been found in Merv, Turkmenistan, a major city on the &#x27;Silk Road&#x27;. The Islamic scholar al-Kindi (801–866 CE) mentions that during the ninth century CE the region of Khorasan, the area to which the cities Nishapur, Merv, Herat and Balkh belong, was a steel manufacturing centre. Evidence from a metallurgical workshop at Merv, dated to the ninth- early tenth century CE, provides an illustration of the co-fusion method of steel production in crucibles, about 1000 years earlier than the distinctly different wootz process. The crucible steel process at Merv might be seen as technologically related to what Bronson (1986, 43) calls Hyderabad process, a variation of the wootz process, after the location of the process documented by Voysey in the 1820s.

===China===
The production of crucible steel in China began around the first century BC, or possibly earlier. The Chinese developed a method of producing pig iron around 1200 BC, which they used to make cast iron. By the first century BC, they had developed puddling to produce mild steel and a process of rapidly decarburizing molten cast-iron to make wrought iron by stirring it atop beds of saltpeter (called the Heaton process, it was independently discovered by John Heaton in the 1860s). Around this time, the Chinese began producing crucible steel to convert excess quantities of cast iron and wrought iron into steel suitable for swords and weapons.

In 1064, Shen Kuo, in his book &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, gave the earliest written description of the patterns in the steel, the methods of sword production, and some of the reasoning behind it:
Ancient people use &quot;chi kang&quot;, (combined steel), for the edge, and &quot;jou thieh&quot; (soft iron) for the back, otherwise it would often break. Too strong a weapon will cut and destroy its own edge; that is why it is advisable to use nothing but combined steel. As for the &quot;yu-chhang&quot; (fish intestines) effect, it is what is now called the &#x27;snake-coiling&#x27; steel sword, or alternatively, the &#x27;pine tree design&#x27;. If you cook a fish fully and remove its bones, the shape of its guts will be seen to be like the lines on a &#x27;snake-coiling sword&#x27;.
==Modern history==

===Early modern accounts===
The first European references to crucible steel seem to be no earlier than the Post Medieval period. European experiments with &quot;Damascus&quot; steels go back to at least the sixteenth century, but it was not until the 1790s that laboratory researchers began to work with steels that were specifically known to be Indian/wootz. At this time, Europeans knew of India&#x27;s ability to make crucible steel from reports brought back by travellers who had observed the process at several places in southern India.

From the mid-17th century onwards, European travellers to the Indian subcontinent wrote numerous vivid eyewitness accounts of the production of steel there. These include accounts by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in 1679, Francis Buchanan in 1807, and H.W. Voysey in 1832.
The 18th, 19th and early 20th century saw a heady period of European interest in trying to understand the nature and properties of wootz steel. Indian wootz engaged the attention of some of the best-known scientists. One was Michael Faraday who was fascinated by wootz steel. It was probably the investigations of George Pearson, reported at the Royal Society in 1795, which had the most far-reaching impact in terms of kindling interest in wootz amongst European scientists. He was the first of these scientists to publish his results and, incidentally, the first to use the word &quot;wootz&quot; in print.

Another investigator, David Mushet, was able to infer that wootz was made by fusion. David Mushet patented his process in 1800. He made his report in 1805. As it happens, however, the first successful European process had been developed by Benjamin Huntsman some 50 years previously in the 1740s.

=== History of production in England ===
Benjamin Huntsman was a clockmaker in search of a better steel for clock springs. In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began producing steel in 1740 after years of experimenting in secret. Huntsman&#x27;s system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 °C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or &quot;pots&quot; were white-hot, they were charged with lumps of blister steel, an alloy of iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities in the form of slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting of the steel produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness in comparison with other steels being made at the time.

Before the introduction of Huntsman&#x27;s technique, Sheffield produced about 200 tonnes of steel per year from Swedish wrought iron (see Oregrounds iron). The introduction of Huntsman&#x27;s technique changed this radically: one hundred years later the amount had risen to over 80,000 tonnes per year, or almost half of Europe&#x27;s total production. Sheffield developed from a small township into one of Europe&#x27;s leading industrial cities.

The steel was produced in specialised workshops called &#x27;crucible furnaces&#x27;, which consisted of a workshop at ground level and a subterranean cellar. The furnace buildings varied in size and architectural style, growing in size towards the latter part of the 19th century as technological developments enabled multiple pots to be &quot;fired&quot; at once, using gas as a heating fuel. Each workshop had a series of standard features, such as rows of melting holes, teaming pits, roof vents, rows of shelving for the crucible pots and annealing furnaces to prepare each pot before firing. Ancillary rooms for weighing each charge and for the manufacture of the clay crucibles were either attached to the workshop, or located within the cellar complex. The steel, originally intended for making clock springs, was later used in other applications such as scissors, axes and swords.

Sheffield&#x27;s Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet operates for the public a scythe-making works, which dates from Huntsman&#x27;s times and is powered by a water wheel, using crucible steel made at the site.

====Material properties====
Previous to Huntsman, the most common method of producing steel was the manufacture of shear steel. In this method, blister steel produced by cementation was used, which consisted of a core of wrought iron surrounded by a shell of very high-carbon steel, typically ranging from 1.5 to 2.0% carbon. To help homogenize the steel, it was pounded into flat plates, which were stacked and forge welded together. This produced steel with alternating layers of steel and iron. The resulting billet could then be hammered flat, cut into plates, which were stacked and welded again, thinning and compounding the layers, and evening out the carbon more as it slowly diffused out of the high-carbon steel into the lower-carbon iron. However, the more the steel was heated and worked, the more it tended to decarburize, and this outward diffusion occurs much faster than the inward diffusion between layers. Thus, further attempts to homogenize the steel resulted in a carbon content too low for use in items like springs, cutlery, swords, or tools. Therefore, steel intended for use in such items, especially tools, was still being made primarily by the slow and arduous bloomery process in very small amounts and at high cost, which, albeit better, had to be manually separated from the wrought iron and was still impossible to fully homogenize in the solid state.

Huntsman&#x27;s process was the first to produce a fully homogeneous steel. Unlike previous methods of steel production, the Huntsman process was the first to fully melt the steel, allowing the full diffusion of carbon throughout the liquid. With the use of fluxes it also allowed the removal of most impurities, producing the first steel of modern quality. Due to carbon&#x27;s high melting point (nearly triple that of steel) and its tendency to oxidize (burn) at high temperatures, it cannot usually be added directly to molten steel. However, by adding wrought iron or pig iron, allowing it to dissolve into the liquid, the carbon content could be carefully regulated (in a way similar to Asian crucible-steels but without the stark inhomogeneities indicative of those steels). Another benefit was that it allowed other elements to be alloyed with the steel. Huntsman was one of the first to begin experimenting with the addition of alloying agents like manganese to help remove impurities such as oxygen from the steel. His process was later used by many others, such as Robert Hadfield and Robert Forester Mushet, to produce the first alloy steels like mangalloy, high-speed steel, and stainless steel.

Due to variations in the carbon content of the blister steel, the carbon steel produced could vary in carbon content between crucibles by as much as 0.18%, but on average produced a eutectoid steel containing ~ 0.79% carbon. Due to the quality and high hardenability of the steel, it was quickly adopted for the manufacture of tool steel, machine tools, cutlery, and many other items. Because no oxygen was blown through the steel, it exceeded Bessemer steel in both quality and hardenability, so Huntsman&#x27;s process was used for manufacturing tool steel until better methods, utilizing an electric arc, were developed in the early 20th century.

===19th and 20th century production===
In another method, developed in the United States in the 1880s, iron and carbon were melted together directly to produce crucible steel. Throughout the 19th century and into the 1920s a large amount of crucible steel was directed into the production of cutting tools, where it was called &quot;tool steel&quot;.

The crucible process continued to be used for specialty steels, but is today obsolete. Similar quality steels are now made with an electric arc furnace. Some uses of &quot;tool steel&quot; were displaced, first by high-speed steel and later by materials such as tungsten carbide.

===Crucible steel elsewhere===
Another form of crucible steel was developed in 1837 by the Russian engineer Pavel Anosov. His technique relied less on the heating and cooling, and more on the quenching process of rapidly cooling the molten steel when the right crystal structure had formed within. He called his steel bulat; its secret died with him. In the United States crucible steel was pioneered by William Metcalf.

<doc id="339126" wikidata="Q7227" url="?curid=339126" title="Emperor Zhao of Han">
<text>Emperor Zhao of Han (; 94 – 5 June 74 BC), born Liu Fuling (劉弗陵), was the eighth emperor of the Han dynasty from 87 to 74 BC. Emperor Zhao was the youngest son of Emperor Wu.

By the time he was born, Emperor Wu was already 62. Prince Fuling ascended the throne after the death of Emperor Wu in 87 BC. He was only eight years old (by East Asian reckoning). Huo Guang served as regent.

Emperor Wu&#x27;s long reign left the Han dynasty greatly expanded; however constant warfare had depleted the empire&#x27;s coffers. Emperor Zhao, under the tutelage of Huo, took the initiative and lowered taxes as well as reducing government spending. As a result, citizens prospered and the Han dynasty enjoyed an era of peace. Emperor Zhao died after reigning for 13 years, at the age of 20. He was succeeded by Liu He, Prince of Changyi.

== Birth and childhood ==
In 94 BC, then Prince Fuling was born to a favourite concubine of Emperor Wu, Zhao Jieyu (趙婕妤), who carried the title Lady Gouyi. Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at his advanced age (62), and because Consort Zhao purportedly had a pregnancy that lasted 14 months, the same length as the mythical Emperor Yao, he named Consort Zhao&#x27;s palace gate &quot;Gate of Yao&#x27;s Mother.&quot; This led to speculation that the Emperor, in favouring Consort Zhao and Prince Fuling, wanted to make Prince Fuling crown prince instead of Crown Prince Liu Ju, the son of Empress Wei Zifu. That, in turn, led to conspiracies against Prince Ju and Empress Wei, eventually forcing Prince Ju to pre-emptively rise up in military self-defence in 91 BC. Being misunderstood as a revolt, Prince Ju was defeated and went into exile, and both he and Empress Wei committed suicide soon afterwards.

After Prince Ju&#x27;s death, Emperor Wu was forced to consider who would make a good heir. Liu Dan, the Prince of Yan, was Emperor Wu&#x27;s oldest surviving son, but Emperor Wu considered both he and his younger brother, Liu Xu, the Prince of Guangling, to be unsuitable, since neither respected the laws of the land. Liu Bo, Lady Li&#x27;s son, had consort kin in the form of his uncle Li Guangli. In any case, before Emperor Wu&#x27;s death, Li Guangli would surrender to the Xiongnu, while Liu Bo predeceased his father. Left with no other options, he decided on his youngest son, Prince Fuling, who was only six at that time. He therefore also chose a potential regent in Huo Guang, whom he considered to be capable and faithful. He also ordered Prince Fuling&#x27;s mother, Lady Gouyi, arrested and executed, fearing that she would become an all-powerful and uncontrollable empress dowager, like Empress Dowager Lü. He entrusted Huo with the regency of Fuling. At Huo&#x27;s suggestion, he also made ethnic Xiongnu official Jin Midi and general Shangguan Jie co-regents. He died on 29 March 87 BC, shortly after creating Prince Fuling crown prince two days earlier. Fuling then succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhao at the age of 8.

== Early reign and marriage ==
Early in Emperor Zhao&#x27;s reign, Huo, Jin and Shangguan served as co-regents, with the key decisions being made by Huo. The palace was run by Princess Eyi, Emperor Wu&#x27;s daughter and Emperor Zhao&#x27;s older sister, who had moved back to the palace to serve as Emperor Zhao&#x27;s caretaker.

Prince Dan of Yan was not happy about the turn in events that led to Emperor Zhao&#x27;s ascension. In 86 BC, he secretly planned a rebellion, forming a conspiracy with two imperial clan members, Liu Zhang () and Liu Ze (). The plan was for them to accuse Emperor Zhao of being not actually Emperor Wu&#x27;s son, and then for Liu Ze, a grandson of a former prince of Qi, to start a rebellion in Linzi (in modern Linzi District, Shandong), the former capital of the Principality of Qi, while Prince Dan would then start a rebellion from his Principality of Yan (roughly modern Beijing). The conspiracy was discovered, but Prince Dan was not punished, although the other conspirators were executed.

Later that year, Jin, a moderating influence in the co-regency, after being created a marquess on his sickbed, died. Huo and Shangguan were subsequently created marquesses as well. In the next few years, Shangguan, unhappy with his lesser role in the co-regency, tried to gain more power over Huo, even though the two had previously been great friends, and Huo had given his daughter in marriage to Shangguan&#x27;s son Shangguan An (). The young couple had a daughter, who was age five in 84 BC, when Shangguan Jie wanted to marry her to the emperor. Huo initially refused, believing her to be too young.

Shangguan Jie turned elsewhere for support of his plan. Shangguan An was a friend of Princess Eyi&#x27;s lover, Ding Wairen (). He encouraged Ding to persuade the princess on the soundness of the marriage, reasoning that the Shangguans&#x27; power would be firmer with the marriage, and that they could then help Ding legitimize his relationship with Princess Eyi. Princess Eyi agreed, and later in 84 BC, the young Lady Shangguan was appointed as an imperial consort. In 83 BC, she was crowned empress.

== Middle reign and the struggle between Shangguan and Huo ==
In 82 BC, a man whose appearance was similar to the former Crown Prince Ju suddenly appeared at the palace, claiming that he was in fact Prince Ju and that he was there to claim the throne. He was arrested and shown to be an imposter named Cheng Fangsui (), and then executed.

Later that year, Shangguan An was created a marquess, and he became extremely arrogant and wild in his behaviour.

In the same year, at the suggestion of Du Yannian (), Huo started considering terminating some of the policies of Emperor Wu intended to raise revenues for the war efforts. In 81 BC, after a major debate between proponents (the chief among whom was vice prime minister Sang Hongyang) and opponents of the state monopolies on salt, iron, and wine, the wine and iron monopolies were abolished, once again allowing the merchants to benefit from the profits of these essentials. The people started to recover from the heavy burdens that Emperor Wu&#x27;s wars had left on them.

In 80 BC, the ongoing conflict between Huo and Shangguan Jie came to a head. The Shangguans, wanting to reward Ding for his role in setting up the marriage between Empress Shangguan and Emperor Zhao, sought to have him created a marquess, but were rebuffed by Huo, as were their subsequent efforts to have Ding made an important official. This caused Princess Eyi to resent Huo as well. The Shangguans, Princess Eyi, Prince Dan of Yan, and Sang (who was resentful that his monopoly system, which he felt to be the key to sound finances for the state, was being dismantled), formed an anti-Huo conspiracy. In 80 BC, Prince Dan sent a report to Emperor Zhao, accusing Huo of improperly exercising imperial authority. The conspirators&#x27; plan was that as soon as Emperor Zhao authorised an investigation, Shangguan Jie and Sang would arrest and immediately execute Huo. However, after the report was given to Emperor Zhao, the 14-year-old Emperor Zhao took no action on it. The next day, he summoned Huo to the palace and exonerated him, reasoning that the actions that Huo was accused of had happened so recently that Prince Dan, a long distance away, could not have possibly known about them, and therefore the report must have been a forgery. At this point, the anti-Huo conspiracy was not discovered, but many were impressed at the wisdom of the young emperor.

Later that year, the conspirators tried again. Their plan was for Princess Eyi to invite Huo to a feast, and then to ambush Huo and kill him, and then depose Emperor Zhao and make Prince Dan emperor. (However, the Shangguans allegedly conspired to instead to have Prince Dan killed once he arrived in the capital, and for Shangguan Jie to declare himself emperor.) The conspiracy was revealed by a servant of Princess Eyi, and the conspirators were arrested and executed with their entire clans. Princess Eyi and Prince Dan committed suicide. Empress Shangguan was spared, however, because of her young age and her status as Huo&#x27;s granddaughter.

== Late reign ==

After the incident, Huo stamped out anyone who could be considered to be a conspirator, gaining a reputation for autocracy and heavy-handedness. The victims included two ministers, Wang Ping () and Xu Ren (). The relationship between Huo and Emperor Zhao remained a positive one, however.

In 77 BC, a controversial incident involving the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former-Soviet central Asia) kingdom of Loulan (on northeastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert) would unfold itself, although whether Emperor Zhao played any role in the decision-making is unclear. A few years earlier, the King of Loulan had died, and with Xiongnu support, one of his sons, Angui () succeeded him, and Angui started a policy of befriending Xiongnu and resisting Han, particularly because Luolan&#x27;s geographical location meant that it was often ordered by Han to escort its imperial messengers, who were also rude to Loulan officials. Huo sent an imperial messenger, Fu Jiezi () to assassinate Angui. Fu accomplished this by claiming that he was there to reward Xiyu kings with jewels and other precious items, and then, setting a private meeting up with Angui, he stabbed him in the heart, and then, warning that any further action would bring a large Chinese army, he got the Loulan nobles to submit and make a brother of Angui, Weituqi (), who was friendly to Han, king. Loulan was renamed Shanshan. (This incident was controversial in Chinese history in that many historians believed that this was one incident in which an assassination of a foreign king was thoroughly unjustified, particularly in the method it was carried out—using jewels as bait. Other historians believed that Angui should be punished for his failure to submit.)

In 74 BC, Emperor Zhao died without a son, and this would lead to a succession problem. After a short duration in which the unsuitable Prince He of Changyi became emperor, the throne was finally given to Emperor Zhao&#x27;s grandnephew, former Crown Prince Ju&#x27;s grandson, Liu Bingyi (), who would ascend the throne as Emperor Xuan.

<doc id="339129" wikidata="Q3268600" url="?curid=339129" title="High-strength low-alloy steel">
<text>High-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA) is a type of alloy steel that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05 and 0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare-earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material&#x27;s strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between . Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.

Copper, silicon, nickel, chromium, and phosphorus are added to increase corrosion resistance. Zirconium, calcium, and rare-earth elements are added for sulfide-inclusion shape control which increases formability. These are needed because most HSLA steels have directionally sensitive properties. Formability and impact strength can vary significantly when tested longitudinally and transversely to the grain. Bends that are parallel to the longitudinal grain are more likely to crack around the outer edge because it experiences tensile loads. This directional characteristic is substantially reduced in HSLA steels that have been treated for sulfide shape control.

They are used in cars, trucks, cranes, bridges, roller coasters and other structures that are designed to handle large amounts of stress or need a good strength-to-weight ratio. HSLA steel cross-sections and structures are usually 20 to 30% lighter than a carbon steel with the same strength.

HSLA steels are also more resistant to rust than most carbon steels because of their lack of pearlite – the fine layers of ferrite (almost pure iron) and cementite in pearlite. HSLA steels usually have densities of around 7800 kg/m3.

Military armour plate is mostly made from alloy steels, although some civilian armour against small arms is now made from HSLA steels with extreme low temperature quenching.

==Classifications==
* Weathering steels: Steels which have better corrosion resistance. A common example is COR-TEN.
* Control-rolled steels: Hot rolled steels which have a highly deformed austenite structure that will transform to a very fine equiaxed ferrite structure upon cooling.
* Pearlite-reduced steels: Low carbon content steels which lead to little or no pearlite, but rather a very fine grain ferrite matrix. It is strengthened by precipitation hardening.
* Acicular ferrite steels: These steels are characterized by a very fine high strength acicular ferrite structure, a very low carbon content, and good hardenability.
* Dual-phase steels: These steels have a ferrite microstructure that contain small, uniformly distributed sections of martensite. This microstructure gives the steels a low yield strength, high rate of work hardening, and good formability.
* Microalloyed steels: Steels which contain very small additions of niobium, vanadium, and/or titanium to obtain a refined grain size and/or precipitation hardening.

A common type of micro-alloyed steel is improved-formability HSLA. It has a yield strength up to but costs only 24% more than A36 steel (). One of the disadvantages of this steel is that it is 30 to 40% less ductile. In the U.S., these steels are dictated by the ASTM standards A1008/A1008M and A1011/A1011M for sheet metal and A656/A656M for plates. These steels were developed for the automotive industry to reduce weight without losing strength. Examples of uses include door-intrusion beams, chassis members, reinforcing and mounting brackets, steering and suspension parts, bumpers, and wheels.

==SAE grades==
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) maintains standards for HSLA steel grades because they are often used in automotive applications.



== Controlled rolling of HSLA steels ==

=== Mechanism ===
Controlled rolling

Controlled rolling is a method of refining the grain of steel by introducing a large amount of nucleation sites for ferrite in the austenite matrix by rolling it at precisely controlled temperature, thereby increasing the strength of the steel. There are three main stages in controlled rolling:

1) Deformation in recrystallization regions. In this stage, austenite is being recrystallized and refined, enabling refinement of ferrite grains in a later stage.

2) Deformation in non-recrystallization regions. Austenite grains are elongated by rolling. Deformation bands might present within the band as well. Elongated grain boundaries and deformation bands are all nucleation sites for ferrite.

3) Deformation in austenite-ferrite two phase region. Ferrite nucleates and austenite are further work-hardened.

Strengthening Mechanism

Control-rolled HSLA steels contain a combination of different strengthening mechanisms. The main strengthening effect comes from grain refinement (Grain boundary strengthening), in which strength increases as the grain size decreases. The other mechanisms include solid solution strengthening and precipitate hardening from micro-alloyed elements. After the steel passes the temperature of austenite-ferrite region, it is then further strengthened by work hardening.

=== Mechanical properties ===
Control-rolled HSLA steels usually have higher strength and toughness, as well as lower ductile-brittle transition temperature and ductile fracture properties. Below are some common micro-alloyed elements used to improve the mechanical properties.

Effect of micro-alloyed elements

Niobium: Nb can increase the recrystallization temperature by around 100 °C, thereby extending the non-recrystallization region and slowing down the grain growth. Nb can increase both the strength and toughness by precipitate strengthening and grain refinement. Moreover, Nb is a strong carbide/nitride former, the Nb(C, N) formed can hinder grain growth during austenite-to-ferrite transition.  

Vanadium: V can significantly increase the strength and transition temperature by precipitate strengthening.

Titanium: Ti produces a slight increase in strengthen via both grain refinement and precipitate strengthening.

Nb, V, and Ti are three common alloying elements in HSLA steels. They are all good carbide and nitride formers, where the precipitates formed can prevent grain growth by pinning grain boundaries. They are also all ferrite formers, which increase the transition temperature of austenite-ferrite two phase region and reduce the non-recrystallization region. The reduction in the non-recrystallization region induces the formation of deformation bands and activated grain boundaries, which are alternative ferrite nucleation sites other than grain boundaries.

Other alloying elements are mainly for solid solution strengthening including silicon, manganese, chromium, copper, and nickel.

<text>Wootz steel is a crucible steel characterized by a pattern of bands and high carbon content. These bands are formed by sheets of microscopic carbides within a tempered martensite or pearlite matrix in higher-carbon steel, or by ferrite and pearlite banding in lower-carbon steels. It was a pioneering steel alloy developed in southern India in the mid-1st millennium BC and exported globally.

==History==

Wootz steel originated in the mid-1st millennium BC in India, wootz steel was made in Golconda in Telangana, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Sri Lanka. The steel was exported as cakes of steely iron that came to be known as &quot;wootz&quot;. The method was to heat black magnetite ore in the presence of carbon in a sealed clay crucible inside a charcoal furnace to completely remove slag. An alternative was to smelt the ore first to give wrought iron, then heat and hammer it to remove slag. The carbon source was bamboo and leaves from plants such as Avārai. Locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating wootz steel from the Cheras by the 5th century BC. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds. Production sites from antiquity have emerged, in places such as Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama and Samanalawewa, as well as imported artifacts of ancient iron and steel from Kodumanal. Recent archaeological excavations (2018) of the Yodhawewa site (in Mannar District) discovered the lower half of a spherical furnace, crucible fragments, and lid fragments related to the crucible steel production through the carburization process. In the South East of Sri Lanka, there were some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period.

Trade between India and Sri Lanka through the Arabian Sea introduced wootz steel to Arabia. The term &quot;muhannad&quot; مهند or &quot;hendeyy&quot; هندي in pre-Islamic and early Islamic Arabic refers to sword blades made from Indian steel, which were highly prized, and are attested in Arabic poetry. Further trade spread the technology to the city of Damascus, where an industry developed for making weapons of this steel. This led to the development of Damascus steel. The 12th century Arab traveler Edrisi mentioned the &quot;Hinduwani&quot; or Indian steel as the best in the world. Arab accounts also point to the fame of &#x27;Teling&#x27; steel, which can be taken to refer to the region of Telangana. The Golconda region of Telangana clearly being the nodal center for the export of wootz steel to West Asia.

Another sign of its reputation is seen in a Persian phraseto give an &quot;Indian answer&quot;, meaning &quot;a cut with an Indian sword&quot;. Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe and the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East.

=== Development of modern metallurgy ===

From the 17th century onwards, several European travelers observed the steel manufacturing in South India, at Mysore, Malabar and Golconda. The word &quot;wootz&quot; appears to have originated as a mistranscription of Sanskrit terms; the Sanskrit root word for the alloy is &quot;utsa&quot;. Another theory says that the word is a variation of &quot;uchcha&quot; or &quot;ucha&quot; (&quot;superior&quot;). According to one theory, the Tamil word &quot;urukku&quot; based on the meaning &quot;melt, dissolve&quot;. Other Dravidian languages have similar-sounding words for steel: &quot;ukku&quot; in Kannada and Telugu, and &quot;urukku&quot; in Malayalam. When Benjamin Heyne inspected the Indian steel in Ceded Districts and other Kannada-speaking areas, he was informed that the steel was &quot;ucha kabbina&quot; (&quot;superior iron&quot;), also known as &quot;ukku tundu&quot; in Mysore.

Legends of wootz steel and Damascus swords aroused the curiosity of the European scientific community from the 17th to the 19th century. The use of high-carbon alloys was little known in Europe previously and thus the research into wootz steel played an important role in the development of modern English, French and Russian metallurgy.

In 1790, samples of wootz steel were received by Sir Joseph Banks, president of the British Royal Society, sent by Helenus Scott. These samples were subjected to scientific examination and analysis by several experts.

Specimens of daggers and other weapons were sent by the Rajas of India to the Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and 1862 International Exhibition. Though the arms of the swords were beautifully decorated and jeweled, they were most highly prized for the quality of their steel. The swords of the Sikhs were said to bear bending and crumpling, and yet be fine and sharp.

==Characteristics==
Wootz is characterized by a pattern caused by bands of clustered particles made by melting of low levels of carbide-forming elements. Wootz contains greater carbonaceous matter than common qualities of cast steel.

The distinct patterns of wootz steel that can be made through forging are wave, ladder, and rose patterns with finely spaced bands. However, with hammering, dyeing, and etching further customized patterns were made.

The presence of cementite nanowires and carbon nanotubes has been identified by Peter Pepler of TU Dresden in the microstructure of wootz steel. There is a possibility of an abundance of ultrahard metallic carbides in the steel matrix precipitating out in bands. Wootz swords were renowned for their sharpness and toughness.

=== Composition ===
T. H. Henry analyzed and recorded the composition of wootz steel samples provided by the Royal School of Mines. Recording:
*Carbon (Combined) 1.34%
* Carbon (Uncombined) 0.31%
* Sulfur 0.17%
* Silicon 0.04%
* Arsenic 0.03%

Wootz steel was analyzed by Michael Faraday and recorded to contain 0.01-0.07% aluminium. Faraday, Messrs (et al.), and Stodart hypothesized that aluminium was needed in the steel and was important in forming the excellent properties of wootz steel. However T. H. Henry deduced that presence of aluminium in the wootz used by these studies was due to slag, forming as silicates. Percy later reiterated that the quality of wootz steel does not depend on the presence of aluminium.

==Reproduction research==

Wootz steel has been reproduced and studied in depth by the Royal School of Mines. Dr. Pearson was the first to chemically examine wootz in 1795 and he published his contributions to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.

Russian metallurgist Pavel Petrovich Anosov (see Bulat steel) was almost able to reproduce ancient wootz steel with nearly all of its properties and the steel he created was very similar to traditional wootz. He documented four different methods of producing wootz steel that exhibited traditional patterns. He died before he could fully document and publish his research. Oleg Sherby and Jeff Wadsworth and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have all done research, attempting to create steels with characteristics similar to wootz, but without success. J.D Verhoeven and Alfred Pendray reconstructed methods of production, proved the role of impurities of ore in the pattern creation, and reproduced wootz steel with patterns microscopically and visually identical to one of the ancient blade patterns. Reibold et al.&#x27;s analyses spoke of the presence of carbon nanotubes enclosing nanowires of cementite, with the trace elements/impurities of vanadium, molybdenum, chromium etc. contributing to their creation, in cycles of heating/cooling/forging. This resulted in a hard high carbon steel that remained malleable.

There are smiths who are now consistently producing wootz steel blades visually identical to the old patterns. Steel manufactured in Kutch (in present-day India) particularly enjoyed a widespread reputation, similar to those manufactured at Glasgow and Sheffield.

Wootz was made over nearly a 2,000-year period (the oldest sword samples date to around 200 CE) and the methods of production of ingots, the ingredients, and the methods of forging varied from one area to the next. Some wootz blades displayed a pattern, while some did not. Heat treating was quite different from forging, and there were many different patterns that were created by the various smiths who spanned from China to Scandinavia.

With fellow experts, the Georgian-Dutch master armourer Gocha Laghidze developed a new method to reintroduce &quot;Georgian Damascus steel&quot;. In 2010, he and his colleagues gave a masterclass on this at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp.

<text>Perelandra (also titled Voyage to Venus in a later edition published by Pan Books) is the second book in the &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; of C. S. Lewis, set on the planet of Perelandra, or Venus. It was first published in 1943.

==Plot summary==

Philologist Elwin Ransom, some years after his return from Mars at the end of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, receives a new mission from the Oyarsa (the angelic ruler) of Mars. Ransom summons narrator-Lewis to his country home. Ransom explains to Lewis that he (Ransom) is to travel to Perelandra (Venus), where he is to counter some kind of attack - details not yet specified - to be launched by Earth&#x27;s Black Archon (Satan). 

Ransom is transported in a casket-like vessel which is seemingly made of ice and contains only himself, unclothed, as Oyarsa tells him clothes are unnecessary on Venus. He returns to Earth over a year later and is met by Lewis and another friend, then recounts his experiences. The remainder of the story is told from Ransom&#x27;s point of view, with Lewis acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator.

Ransom arrives in Venus after a quick journey through inter-planetary space. He finds that the surface of the planet is covered in a sweet-water ocean which is dotted with floating rafts of vegetation. These rafts resemble islands, to the extent of having plant and animal life upon them, including edible plants and plants large enough to provide shelter. As the rafts have no geologic foundations, they are in a constant state of motion. The planet&#x27;s sole observable geological feature is a stony mountain called the Fixed Land. The planet&#x27;s thick atmosphere hides the sun and stars, although like Earth, the planet rotates and has days and nights.

Ransom soon meets the Queen of the planet. She is a carefree being who soon accepts him as a friend. Unlike the inhabitants of Mars in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, she resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her green skin. She and her husband the King are the first, and so far the only, human inhabitants of their world. The two of them live on the floating raft-islands and are forbidden, by Maleldil&#x27;s divine command, to sleep on the Fixed Land. Ransom finds that in the spiritually pure context, the beautiful naked queen arouses no sexual desire or temptation in him, even though the King himself is away elsewhere on the planet.

Professor Weston arrives in a spaceship and lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the Fixed Land. Instead of the strictly materialist attitude he displayed when first meeting Ransom, he now tells Ransom that he has become aware of the existence of supernatural spiritual beings. He pledges his allegiance to what he calls the &quot;Life-Force&quot;, which, he says, has been guiding him in extraordinary ways. After an increasingly disturbing monologue, he succumbs to full demonic possession.

Now under demonic control, the possessed Weston finds the Queen and tries to tempt her into defying Maleldil&#x27;s law by spending a night on the Fixed Land. Ransom realizes why the Oyarsa has brought him to Perelandra: to counter the tempter by persuading the Queen to obey Maleldil&#x27;s prohibition, and to prevent the Perelandran counterpart to the Fall of humanity on Earth. In the Queen&#x27;s presence, he struggles through day after day of exhausting argument against the demonic Weston, who shows super-human brilliance in debate. Weston&#x27;s possessed body requires no sleep; this enables him to use methods other than explicit arguments while Ransom sleeps: the tempter tells the Queen many stories of heroic defiance and introduces her to self-gratifying vanities such as clothing, makeup, and mirrors. On occasions when the Queen is sleeping and Ransom is awake, the tempter attacks Ransom&#x27;s morale by engaging in infantile obscenities and by torturing and mutilating small native animals.

With the demonic Weston on the verge of winning, Ransom senses a divine command to terminate the argument altogether and battle the Tempter physically, hand to hand. The prospect terrifies Ransom, who is a slight, middle-aged man with no recent fighting prowess. He debates for hours with the divine inner voice, until he is suddenly blessed with awareness that he cannot refuse the command to fight: his personal character simply rules out the possibility of refusing. He also perceives that the distinction between personal choice (free will) and personal destiny (pre-destination) is not a real distinction at all; the two are, somehow, exactly the same thing.

Ransom physically attacks his opponent (who is still inhabiting Weston&#x27;s body). As the fight progresses, he finds himself inspired to greater and greater fury, shouting battle-cries he has never heard and using combat techniques he has never learned. After fierce, punishing resistance, the enemy flees. Ransom chases him over the ocean, both riding on the backs of giant friendly fish. Their struggle continues in water and in a rocky underground tunnel, alternating between verbal argument and physical combat, until Ransom finally throws Weston&#x27;s possessed body into a pool of fiery lava, terminating the demon&#x27;s presence on the planet altogether.

Ransom finds his way to the surface, and recuperates from his injuries. Only a bite-wound on his heel refuses to close and continues bleeding for the rest of his life. Ransom carves a memorial inscription for Weston, to commemorate his scientific achievements, while also recording his surrender to the Devil.

Ransom meets the King and Queen together with the Oyéresu of Mars and Venus, the latter of whom transfers dominion of the planet to the King and Queen. All the characters celebrate the prevention of a second biblical &quot;Fall&quot; and the beginning of a utopian paradise in this new world. The story climaxes with Ransom&#x27;s vision of &quot;The Great Dance&quot;: the exchange of higher and lower, as when an advisor gives power to a royal child. Ransom is then returned to Earth, covered in celebratory flower-petals.

<text>The 1779 Sullivan Expedition (also known as the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition, the Sullivan Campaign, and the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign) was a United States military campaign during the American Revolutionary War, lasting from June to October 1779, against the four British-allied nations of the Iroquois (also known as the Haudenosaunee). The campaign was ordered by George Washington in response to Iroquois and Loyalist attacks on the Wyoming Valley, and Cherry Valley. The campaign had the aim of &quot;the total destruction and devastation of their settlements.&quot; Four Continental Army brigades carried out a scorched-earth campaign in the territory of the Iroquois Confederacy in what is now central New York.

The expedition was largely successful, with 40 Iroquois villages razed and their crops and food stores destroyed. The campaign drove just over 5,000 Iroquois to Fort Niagara seeking British protection, and depopulated the area for post-war settlement. Some scholars argue that it was an attempt to annihilate the Iroquois and describe the campaign as a genocide although this term is disputed. Today this area is the heartland of Upstate New York, with thirty-five monoliths marking the path of Sullivan&#x27;s troops and the locations of the Iroquois villages they razed dotting the region, having been erected by the New York State Education Department in 1929 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the expedition.

==Overview==
Led by Major General John Sullivan and Brigadier General James Clinton, the expedition was conducted during the summer of 1779, beginning on June 18 when the army marched from Easton, Pennsylvania, to October 3 when it abandoned Fort Sullivan, built at Tioga, to return to George Washington&#x27;s main camp in New Jersey. While the campaign had only one major battle at Newtown on the Chemung River in western New York, the expedition severely damaged the Iroquois nations&#x27; economies by destroying their crops, villages, and chattels. The death toll from exposure, starvation and disease the following winter dwarfed the casualties received in the Battle of Newtown, during which Sullivan&#x27;s army of 3,200 Continental soldiers decisively defeated about 600 Iroquois and Loyalists.

In response to 1778 attacks by Iroquois and Loyalists on American settlements, such as on Cobleskill, German Flatts, the Wyoming Valley and Cherry Valley, as well as Iroquois support of the British during the 1777 Battles of Saratoga, Sullivan&#x27;s army carried out a scorched-earth campaign to put an end to Iroquois attacks. The American force methodically destroyed 40 Iroquois villages throughout the Finger Lakes region of western New York. Thousands of Indigenous refugees fled to Fort Niagara on Lake Ontario at the mouth of the Niagara River. The devastation created great hardship for those who sheltered under British military protection outside Fort Niagara that winter, and many starved or froze to death, despite efforts by the British authorities to supply food and provide shelter using their limited resources.

==Background==

When the Revolutionary War began, British officials, as well as the colonial Continental Congress, sought the allegiance (or at least the neutrality) of the Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy, also known as the Six Nations. The Iroquois eventually divided over what course to pursue. Most Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Mohawks chose to ally themselves with the British. Most Oneidas and Tuscaroras joined the American revolutionaries, thanks in part to the influence of Presbyterian missionary Samuel Kirkland. For the Iroquois, the American Revolution became a civil war.

The Iroquois homeland lay on the frontier between the Province of Quebec and the provinces of New York and Pennsylvania. Following the October 1777 surrender of British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s forces after the Battles of Saratoga, Loyalists and their Iroquois allies began raiding American frontier settlements, as well as the villages of the Oneida. Working out of Fort Niagara, men such as Loyalist commander Major John Butler, Mohawk military leader Joseph Brant, and Seneca war chiefs Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter led the joint British-Indigenous raids. 

On May 30, 1778, a raid on Cobleskill by Brant&#x27;s Volunteers resulted in the deaths of 22 regulars and militia. On June 10, 1778, the Board of War of the Continental Congress concluded that a major Indian war was in the offing. Since a defensive war would prove inadequate, the board called for an expedition of 3,000 men against Fort Detroit and a similar thrust into Seneca country to punish the Iroquois. Congress designated Major General Horatio Gates to lead the expedition and appropriated funds for the campaign. Despite these efforts, the campaign did not occur until the following year.

On July 3, 1778, Butler, Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter led a mixed force of Indigenous warriors and Rangers in an attack on the Wyoming Valley, a rebel granary and settlement along the north branch of the Susquehanna River in what is now Pennsylvania. Roughly 300 of the armed Patriot defenders were killed at the Battle of Wyoming, after which houses, barns, and mills were razed throughout the valley.

In September 1778, a response to the Wyoming defeat was undertaken by Colonel Thomas Hartley who destroyed a number of abandoned Delaware and Seneca villages along the Susquehanna River, including Tioga. At the same time, Joseph Brant led an attack on German Flatts in the Mohawk Valley, destroying numerous houses, barns and mills. In October, further American retaliation was taken by Continental Army units under Lieutenant Colonel William Butler who destroyed the substantial Indigenous villages at Unadilla and Onaquaga on the Susquehanna River.

On November 11, 1778, Loyalist Captain Walter Butler (the son of John Butler) led two companies of Butler&#x27;s Rangers, a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot, about 300 Seneca and Cayuga led by Cornplanter, and a small group of Mohawks led by Joseph Brant, on an assault at Cherry Valley in New York. While the rangers and regulars blockaded Fort Alden, the Seneca rampaged through the village, killing and scalping 16 soldiers and 32 civilians, mostly women and children, and taking 80 captives. In less than a year, Butler&#x27;s Rangers and their Iroquois allies had reduced much of upstate New York and northeastern Pennsylvania to ruins, causing thousands of settlers to flee and depriving the Continental Army of food.

The Cherry Valley massacre convinced the Americans that they needed to take action. In April 1779, Colonel Goose Van Schaick led an expedition of 558 Continental Army troops against the Onondaga people. About 50 houses and a large quantity of corn and beans were burned. Van Schaick reported that they took &quot;thirty three Indians and one white man prisoner, and killed twelve Indians.&quot; Despite Van Schaick&#x27;s superior James Clinton ordering him to prevent his soldiers from assaulting any Onondaga women (noting that &quot;Bad as the savages are, they never violate the chastity of any women&quot;), the Americans committed numerous atrocities during the expedition. American soldiers &quot;killed babies and raped women&quot;, and an Onondaga chief recounted to the British in 1782 how the Americans &quot;put to death all the Women and Children, excepting some of the Young Women, whom they carried away for the use of their Soldiers &amp; were afterwards put to death in a more shameful manner&quot;.

When the British began to concentrate their military efforts on the southern colonies in 1779, Washington used the opportunity to launch a major offensive against the British-allied Iroquois. His initial impulse was to assign the expedition to Major General Charles Lee, however, Lee as well as Major General Philip Schuyler and Major General Israel Putnam were all disregarded for various reasons. Washington offered command of the expedition to Horatio Gates, the &quot;Hero of Saratoga,&quot; but Gates turned down the offer, ostensibly for health reasons. Finally, Major General John Sullivan accepted command.

Washington&#x27;s issued his specific orders in a letter to Sullivan on May 31, 1779:

==Expedition==

The expedition was one of the largest campaigns of the Continental Army, involving more than one third of its soldiers. Sullivan was assigned four Continental Army brigades totalling 4,469 men. By the time the expedition set out this number had fallen to just under 4,000 due to disease, desertions and expired enlistments.

In April 1779, Edward Hand&#x27;s brigade was ordered from Minisink to the Wyoming Valley to establish a base camp for the expedition. In May 1779, the brigades of Enoch Poor and William Maxwell assembled at Easton where they were joined by Sullivan and Thomas Proctor&#x27;s 4th Artillery Regiment. Before they could proceed to Wyoming a road had to be hewn through the wilderness between the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers. The road was completed in mid-June and Sullivan&#x27;s forces arrived at Wyoming on June 23 after a five-day march. A number of smaller units, including three companies of Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen, joined the expedition at Wyoming.

Supply shortages delayed Sullivan&#x27;s departure from Wyoming until July 31 when the expedition set out for Tioga at the confluence of the Chemung and Susquehanna rivers. The expedition proceeded cautiously, slowed by the mountainous terrain and the need to keep abreast of the 134 flatboats carrying Sullivan&#x27;s artillery and supplies up the Susquehanna. With the expedition were 1,200 pack horses, 700 head of cattle, four brass three-pound cannons, two six-pound cannons, two 5½-inch howitzers, and one coehorn. The expedition arrived at Tioga on August 11 and construction began on a temporary fort that was named Fort Sullivan.

===Battle of Chemung===
After arriving at Tioga, Sullivan dispatched a small party to reconnoitre Chemung, a Delaware village upstream, where he believed Indigenous and Loyalist forces were gathering. When the scouts returned they reported the presence of a large number of &quot;both white people and Indians&quot; in &quot;great confusion&quot; but were unable to tell if the enemy were preparing to fight or depart. Sullivan decided an immediate attack was warranted. Leaving behind a garrison of 250 at Tioga, Sullivan&#x27;s forces marched overnight and arrived at Chemung at dawn on August 13. They discovered that the village had been hastily abandoned. While Poor&#x27;s soldiers torched the village and destroyed the crops in the surrounding fields, Hand&#x27;s brigade searched for traces of the escaped villagers. About a mile west of the village, a detachment of the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment was ambushed by 30 Delaware led by Roland Montour. The Continentals were able to counterattack and force the Delaware to retreat but suffered six killed and 12 wounded. Later a detachment of the 1st New Hampshire Regiment was fired upon while destroying crops on the opposite side of the river, killing one and wounding four. Sullivan&#x27;s forces withdrew from Chemung that afternoon and returned to the encampment at Tioga after nightfall.

===Clinton&#x27;s Brigade===

The fourth brigade, commanded by James Clinton, assembled at Canojaharie on the Mohawk River. A road was cut through the forest from the Mohawk River to Otsego Lake, the source of the Susquehanna River. For six days in June, wagons trundled back and forth carrying supplies and 208 flatboats to the head of the lake. The supplies were then loaded onto the boats and ferried across. Clinton established his headquarters at the south end of the lake in early July and waited for Sullivan&#x27;s order to march.

Clinton received the order to start for Tioga on August 9. Due to low water levels on the Susquehanna, Clinton had ordered the construction of a dam that had raised the water level on Otsego Lake by . The boats, laden with supplies, were hauled to the shallows below the dam. The dam was breached and the boats were able to float downriver, paced by Clinton&#x27;s soldiers marching along both banks.

Clinton reached Unadilla on August 12, and Oquaga two days later. Both villages had been destroyed by William Butler a year earlier. After a two-day rest, Clinton&#x27;s brigade continued downriver, burning abandoned hamlets and scattered farms. On August 19, they reached the mouth of Choconut Creek where a large detachment from Poor&#x27;s and Hand&#x27;s brigades was waiting to escort them to Tioga. Clinton entered Sullivan&#x27;s camp on August 22.

===Battle of Newtown===
The expedition departed Fort Sullivan on August 26, and cautiously headed up the Chemung River valley. In the early morning of August 29, Sullivan&#x27;s advance guard discovered a camouflaged, half-mile long breastwork of logs. The breastwork was manned by Butler&#x27;s Rangers, Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot, and about 350 Seneca, Cayuga and Delaware warriors. Sullivan had Hand&#x27;s brigade form a line of battle facing the breastwork while Proctor&#x27;s artillery was positioned on a nearby rise. Poor&#x27;s New Hampshire Brigade and Clinton&#x27;s New York Brigade were ordered to circle around to the right and climb the steep hill to the enemy&#x27;s rear.

Poor and Clinton were given an hour to move into position. When the artillery opened fire the plan was for Hand to feint a frontal attack on the breastwork while Poor and Clinton attacked from behind. Maxwell&#x27;s brigade was kept in reserve except for the 1st New Jersey which moved to cut off any retreat along the river. The guns, however, opened fire well before Poor and Clinton reached their objective. Their route had taken them through a &quot;morass&quot; that slowed their progress. The British commander, Major John Butler, became aware that his position was in danger of being flanked and began a withdrawal. An attack by a group of Indigenous warriors against the 2nd New Hampshire, which was still struggling to ascend the hill, caused significant casualties and allowed the rest of Butler&#x27;s forces to escape. 

In his report to George Washington, Sullivan reported three dead and 39 wounded. Five of the wounded later succumbed to their injuries bringing the total to eight dead. Butler reported five of his Rangers killed or taken and three wounded as well as five killed and nine wounded among the Iroquois. American sources reported two prisoners taken, and twelve Indigenous dead, including a woman.

===Boyd and Parker Ambush===

Sullivan&#x27;s force destroyed Newtown and several other abandoned Delaware villages along the Chemung River, then turned north towards Seneca Lake. After burning Queanettquaga (Catherine&#x27;s Town), the home of Catherine Montour, the expedition headed up the east side of the lake and then west to Kanadaseaga, setting every structure on fire, destroying food stores and the crops in the fields, cutting down orchards, and fulfilling Washington&#x27;s directive to cause &quot;the total destruction and devastation of their settlements.&quot;

Following the destruction of Kanadaseaga, Sullivan&#x27;s forces continued west towards the Genesee River and Chenussio, also known as Little Beard&#x27;s Town. On September 12, after marching from Honeoye Lake, Sullivan&#x27;s forces camped between Hemlock Lake and Conesus Lake. From there Sullivan dispatched Lieutenant Thomas Boyd of Morgan&#x27;s Rifle Corps to reconnoiter Chenussio. Boyd took with him 26 riflemen including Sergeant Michael Parker, and Thaosagwat, an Oneida guide also known as Han Yost. The following morning Boyd&#x27;s patrol reached an abandoned village which he believed was Chenussio. Meanwhile, about 200 Butler&#x27;s Rangers led by John Butler and Seneca warriors led by Cornplanter and Little Beard, were preparing to ambush the vanguard of Sullivan&#x27;s army as it emerged from the marshy area south of Conesus Lake, unaware that Boyd&#x27;s patrol had unknowingly passed them in the night.

As Boyd&#x27;s patrol kept watch for signs of enemy activity, four Seneca on horseback entered the village. One was killed but three escaped. Afraid that the gunfire would draw more of the enemy to the village, Boyd ordered a return to Sullivan&#x27;s position. On the trail they spotted several more Seneca who fled. Thaosagwat warned Boyd not to give chase but the warning was ignored, and the patrol stumbled into the ambush. Surrounded and outnumbered, fourteen of Boyd&#x27;s men were killed while Boyd, Parker and Thaosagwat were captured. Thaosagwat was immediately executed by Little Beard while Boyd and Parker were later tortured to death. The mutilated bodies of Boyd and Parker were discovered when Sullivan&#x27;s forces entered Chenussio on September 14.

===Return to Tioga===

After destroying Chenussio&#x27;s 128 houses with its gardens and cornfields, Sullivan retraced his steps, aware that provisions were growing short, and mistakenly believing there were no other Seneca villages west of the Genesee River. At the north end of Seneca Lake he met with a delegation of Oneida that brought a message from the Cayuga claiming neutrality. Ignoring their plea, Sullivan ordered William Butler with 600 men to cross over to Cayuga Lake and lay waste to the Cayuga villages on the eastern shore. Henry Dearborn and the 3rd New Hampshire were tasked with destroying the villages on the western shore of the lake while William Smith and the 5th New Jersey would burn any villages on the western shore of Seneca Lake. 

Over the next five days, Bulter&#x27;s and Dearborn&#x27;s men leveled the two large Cayuga villages of Goiogouen and Chonodote, as well as smaller villages and hamlets. Coreorgonel, a village of Tutelo who had been adopted by the Cayuga, was also destroyed.
Exhausted from carrying the expedition&#x27;s supplies, many of Sullivan&#x27;s pack horses reached the end of their endurance on the return to Tioga. Just north of what is now Elmira, New York, Sullivan ordered most of them euthanized. A few years later, the skulls of these horses were lined along the trail as a warning to potential settlers. The area became known as &quot;The Valley of Horses Heads&quot; and is now known as the town and village of Horseheads.

Sullivan, with the main body of his forces, returned to the Chemung River on September 24 and waited for Dearborn and Butler to arrive. Dearborn&#x27;s detachment reached Sullivan&#x27;s camp two days later while Butler&#x27;s did not arrive until September 28. Sullivan&#x27;s army returned to Tioga on September 30. Fort Sullivan was demolished on October 3, and the following day Sullivan&#x27;s army boarded the flatboats for a three-day journey down the Susquehanna to Wyoming. Two days after arriving at Wyoming, Sullivan received orders to bring his army to West Point.

Overall, 40 villages, numerous isolated houses and 160,000 bushels of corn, as well as orchards and a vast quantity of vegetables were destroyed. Including deaths from illness, only 40 men had been lost.

===Brodhead&#x27;s expedition===

Further to the west, a concurrent expedition was undertaken by Colonel Daniel Brodhead. Brodhead, who had been given command of the Western Department in March 1779, was a strong advocate of launching an offensive against the western Seneca. Washington&#x27;s strategy for the &quot;chastisement of the savages&quot; initially included an operation from Fort Pitt, but in April 1779, he had ordered the expedition cancelled due to supply issues. Brodhead, however, indicated that he had sufficient men and provisions to mount an attack, and on July 21, Washington gave permission for the expedition to proceed.

Brodhead departed Fort Pitt on August 11, 1779, with a contingent of 605 &quot;rank and file&quot; from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment, the 9th Virginia Regiment and the Maryland Rifle Corps, as well as militia, volunteers and allied Delaware warriors. The expedition proceeded northwards up the valley of the Allegheny River into Seneca territory in what is now northwestern Pennsylvania.

Several days into the march, Brodhead&#x27;s vanguard of 15 Continentals and eight Delaware encountered seven canoes with between 30 and 40 Seneca warriors heading down the Allegheny. The Seneca are reported to have beached their canoes and prepared to fight. In the ensuing skirmish five of the warriors were killed and the rest were driven off. Two Continentals and one of the Delaware suffered slight wounds. According to Seneca oral tradition, however, the &quot;warriors&quot; were a hunting party that had already beached their canoes when they were surprised by the Americans. 

Sullivan&#x27;s forces entered the abandoned settlement of Buckaloon at the mouth of Brokenstraw Creek then proceeded eight miles further up the Allegheny to Conawago which appeared to have been abandoned several months previously. The expedition then continued twenty miles upstream to Yoghroonwago, a cluster of eight hamlets. The Seneca who lived at Yoghroonwago had fled their homes as Brodhead approached leaving many of their possessions behind. Over the next three days, Brodhead&#x27;s men plundered and burned 130 houses, captured horses and cattle, and destroyed 500 acres of corn.

Although there had been earlier discussion about Brodhead linking up with Sullivan at Chenussio for an attack against Fort Niagara, Brodhead turned back after razing Yoghroonwago. From the mouth of French Creek, Brodhead sent a detachment upstream to destroy the settlement of Mahusqueehikoken. Like Yoghroonwago, Mahusqueehikoken had been hastily abandoned before Broadhead&#x27;s forces arrived. The expedition returned to Fort Pitt on September 14 after covering 450 miles in 35 days.

===Tiononderoga===
The final operation of the campaign occurred in late September. From Kanadaseaga, Sullivan sent Colonel Peter Gansevoort with 100 men to the Mohawk Valley. Gansevoort was ordered to destroy the Mohawk settlement of Tiononderoga and capture the inhabitants. Sullivan believed that Tiononderoga, located beside Fort Hunter at the mouth of Schoharie Creek, was &quot;constantly employed in giving intelligence to the enemy.&quot; Gansevoort reached Fort Stanwix on September 25, and four days later surprised and captured the occupants of Tiononderoga&#x27;s four houses. Gansevoort wrote, &quot;It is remarked that the Indians live much better than most of the Mohawk River farmers, their houses very well furnished with all necessary household utensils, great plenty of grain, several horses, cows, and wagons&quot;. 

A group of local colonists, homeless after earlier Indigenous raids, successfully petitioned Gansevoort to turn the houses over to them. Gansevoort&#x27;s actions were criticized by Philip Schuyler, Commissioner for Indian Affairs and member of the Continental Congress, because the captured Mohawks were strictly neutral. The Mohawks were held prisoner at Albany until released on Washington&#x27;s orders in late October.

==British reaction==
Canadian historian Gavin Watt described the British reaction to the invasion of the Iroquois homeland as &quot;incredibly weak and ill-timed.&quot; Following France&#x27;s declaration of war against Britain in June 1778, Governor Frederick Haldimand of Quebec became preoccupied with the possibility of a Franco-American invasion. As a result he focused on reinforcing the defences of the St. Lawrence River valley rather than supporting Britain&#x27;s Iroquois allies by establishing a long-promised post at Oswego on Lake Ontario or increasing troop strength at Fort Niagara.

By the spring of 1779 the British had become aware that the Americans were planning a major offensive although the target was unclear. Reports had reached Quebec about the construction of a large number of bateaux at Stillwater on the Hudson River which suggested an attack on Montreal. Haldimand also received information that American troops were gathering at Albany and Schenectady with the goal of establishing a military presence at Oswego.

Lord Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, expressed his belief that the building of bateaux at Stillwater indicated that the Americans intended to move forces up the Mohawk River to Fort Stanwix, and from there would move against Fort Niagara or Fort Detroit. Sir Henry Clinton, the commander-in-chief of British forces in America, was convinced that the Americans were planning to capture Fort Detroit and that a feint up Susquehanna River valley would be used to draw the attention of Butler&#x27;s Rangers and the allied Iroquois.

In May 1779, Major Butler, accompanied by five companies of Butler&#x27;s Rangers and a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot, established a forward operating base at Kanadaseaga located near the northern end of Seneca Lake. At Kanadaseaga, Butler received reports from Indigenous scouts and American deserters of the gathering of troops and the stockpiling of supplies at Canajoharie and Wyoming. He passed on this information to the British commander of Fort Niagara, Lieutenant Colonel Mason Bolton, who forwarded it to Haldimand. Butler later reported that there was no doubt that the &quot;rebels&quot; were coming up the Susquehanna with the ultimate goal of attacking Fort Niagara. Haldimand, however, was skeptical about the accuracy of such reports:

On July 20, Joseph Brant led his volunteers and a detachment of Butler&#x27;s Rangers against the settlement of Minisink in the upper Delaware River valley. Ten houses, eleven barns, a church, and a gristmill were destroyed in the raid. Most of the settlers escaped to main fort but four men were killed and three were taken prisoner. Two days later, a force of 120 militiamen led by Colonel John Hathorn tried to intercept Brant&#x27;s force at Minisink Ford. Before an ambush could be set, an accidental rifle discharge alerted Brant to the trap. Brant was able to gain the high ground behind Hathorn and in the ensuing battle 46 militiamen were killed. Brant reported three of his men killed and of the ten wounded, four were unlikely to survive.

On July 28, Captain John McDonell attacked Fort Freeland on the West Branch of the Susquehanna with his company of Butler&#x27;s Rangers, a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot, and 120 Seneca led by Cornplanter. The fort&#x27;s small garrison quickly surrendered, and a relief force that arrived shortly afterwards was routed. After interrogating the fort&#x27;s commander, McDonell wrote to Butler that he had no doubt of the American intention to attack the &quot;Indian Country&quot; from Wyoming. He wrote that Sullivan and Maxwell had joined Hand at Wyoming with artillery, boats and pack horses. Butler passed this information to Quebec adding that Clinton was at Lake Otsego and would rendezvous with Sullivan at Tioga. In response, Haldimand wrote directly to Butler in August reaffirming his belief that Fort Detroit was the target and that the American forces on the Susquehanna were a feint.

In mid-August, Butler accompanied by about 300 Seneca and Cayuga warriors led by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter, and Fish Carrier moved south to the Chemung River where they were joined by Joseph Brant and Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, as well as a number of Delaware. Butler and Brant believed that harassment raids would be more effective than making a stand, however, they were overruled by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter and the Delaware. Following the Battle of Newtown, Butler retreated to Kanadaseaga and then to Chenussio. After the Boyd and Parker Ambush, he withdrew further west to Buffalo Creek.

In early September, Haldimand reluctantly decided to send reinforcements. He ordered Sir John Johnson to take command of a 400-man relief expedition that would proceed from Lachine up the St Lawrence River to Carleton Island. The expedition consisted of soldiers from Johnson&#x27;s King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York (KRRNY), detachments of the 34th Regiment of Foot and the 47th Regiment of Foot, a company of German Jäger (infantry), and Leake&#x27;s Independent Company. They were joined by Mohawk, Abenaki and Wendat warriors from the Seven Nations of Canada. The expedition departed Lachine on September 13 and reached Carleton Island on September 26. At Carleton Island, Johnson learned that Sullivan was withdrawing back to Tioga. He briefly considered an attack against Fort Sullivan, but abandoned the idea in favour of an attack against the Oneida. This plan was also abandoned when it was learned that the Oneida had been forewarned. Finally, Johnson received orders to have the KRRNY, Leake&#x27;s and the 34th garrison Carleton Island while the Jägers were to be sent to Niagara and the 47th to Detroit.

==Aftermath==
Sullivan received the thanks of Congress on October 14, 1779. On November 6, 1779 he informed George Washington that he intended to resign from the Continental Army, writing &quot;My Health is too much impair’d.&quot; Sullivan elaborated further in a letter to Congress dated November 9, 1779: &quot;My Heal⟨th⟩ is so much impair’d by a violent bilious disorder, which seize⟨d⟩ me in the commencement, and continued during the whole of the western expedition.&quot; Congress accepted Sullivan&#x27;s resignation on November 30, 1779.

On September 21, 1779, there were 5036 Indigenous refugees at Fort Niagara. This number decreased to 3,678 by October 2, and by November 21, roughly 2,600 refugees still remained at Fort Niagara. Two Seneca villages west of the Genesee River had escaped destruction and absorbed some of the refugees. A small number relocated to Carleton Island at the eastern end of Lake Ontario. Some refugees returned to their razed villages, and some moved into hunting camps. After wintering at Fort Niagara, most of the remaining Seneca and Cayuga resettled at Buffalo Creek at the eastern end of Lake Erie.

The winter of 1780 was especially hard with frequent storms and bitter cold. New York Harbour froze completely, and British soldiers were able to march across the ice from Manhattan to Staten Island. At Fort Niagara, the Iroquois refugees who had taken shelter there suffered greatly. The snow fell several feet deep and the temperature remained well below freezing for many weeks. Deer and other game died in large numbers. An unknown number of refugees died from hypothermia, starvation, or disease.

Francis Goring, an employee of the trading firm Taylor &amp; Forsyth, described the conditions at Fort Niagara in an October 1780 letter to his uncle:

In February 1780, Philip Schuyler, a member of the Continental Congress, sent four pro-rebellion Iroquois messengers to Fort Niagara. Little Abraham, a neutral Mohawk leader, told his listeners that the Continental Congress was ready to offer peace if the refugees were to return to their own country and embrace neutrality. The Seneca war chief Sayenqueraghta was indignant. Mohawk war leader Aaron Hill accused the four of being deceitful spies. Guy Johnson, the Superintendent of the British Indian Department, ordered the messengers imprisoned in Fort Niagara&#x27;s &quot;black hole,&quot; an unheated, unlit stone cell. Little Abraham died as a result of his harsh confinement. 

The year 1780 coincided with the sudden appearance of a massive number of periodical cicadas (a large insect species which emerge from underground only once every seventeen years to breed) in the region of the conflicts. The sudden arrival of such a large quantity of the insects provided a source of sustenance for the Onondaga  people who were experiencing severe food insecurity following the Sullivan campaigns and the subsequent brutal winter. The seemingly miraculous arrival of the cicadas (specifically, Brood VII also known as the Onondaga brood) is commemorated by the Onondaga as though it were an intervention by the Creator to ensure their survival after such a traumatizing, catastrophic event. 

294 formerly rebel Onondagas, Tuscaroras, and Oneidas arrived at Fort Niagara in early July 1780 and declared their support for the British.

The Sullivan expedition did not end Iroquois participation in the Revolutionary War. Although the destruction of their villages and crops forced the Iroquois to take refuge at Fort Niagara and put considerable strain on British resources, it also triggered devastating revenge attacks. John Butler reported that 59 war parties set out from Fort Niagara between February and September 1780. A raid on Harpersfield in April 1780 led by Joseph Brant killed three and took 11 prisoners. In May 1780, Iroquois warriors accompanied Sir John Johnson and the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York in a raid that destroyed every building in Caughnawaga except for the church. In October, Johnson led a second expedition against the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys in which 200 dwellings were burned and 150,000 tons of grain destroyed. 265 Iroquois warriors including Brant, Cornplanter and Sayenqueraghta participated in this expedition during which 40 patriot militia were killed at the Battle of Stone Arabia. In total, the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys saw 330 men, women and children killed or taken prisoner, six forts and several mills destroyed, and over 700 houses and barns burned in 1780. 

According to Barbara Graymont, author of The &quot;Iroquois in the American Revolution&quot;, &quot;the campaign of 1780 was an eloquent testimony to the ineffectiveness of Sullivan&#x27;s expedition in quelling the Indian threat to the frontier.&quot; Military historian Joseph Fischer describes the Sullivan Expedition expedition as a &quot;well-executed failure.&quot; In his conclusion to his journal of the campaign, Major Jeremiah Fogg noted: &quot;The nests are destroyed, but the birds are still on the wing.&quot;

The Iroquois were ignored in the peace negotiations between the United States and Britain that led to the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Beginning in 1784, the United States negotiated a series of treaties with the Iroquois that led to the cession of most of their traditional territory. In the October 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois delegates relinquished their claims to the Ohio Country, and ceded a strip of land along the east side of the Niagara River as well as all of their territory west of mouth of Buffalo Creek. The Six Nations in council at Buffalo Creek, however, refused to ratify the treaty, denying that their delegates had the authority to surrender such large tracts of land.

In October 1784, Sir Frederick Haldimand, the governor of the province of Quebec, signed a decree that granted to the Iroquois in compensation for their alliance with British forces during the war. This tract of land, known as the Haldimand Tract, extended for six miles (9.7 km) to each side of the Grand River, from its source to Lake Erie. In 1785, Joseph Brant led about 1,450 to the Haldimand Tract. Others, primarily Mohawk, settled with John Deseronto on the Bay of Quinte. A significant number of Seneca, Cayuga and Onondaga remained at Buffalo Creek.

In 1788, at the First Treaty of Buffalo Creek, a syndicate of land speculators led by Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham purchased from the Seneca their territory between the Genessee River and Seneca Lake. The following year the Cayuga ceded to New York most of their traditional territory except for roughly 64,000 acres at the north end of Cayuga Lake. The November 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua established perpetual “peace and friendship” between the Iroquois and the United States, and acknowledged the sovereignty of the Iroquois within their lands. The 1797 Treaty of Big Tree saw the Seneca relinquish their rights to most of their remaining territory west of the Genesee River. 12 parcels of land were reserved for the Seneca including tracts at Buffalo Creek, Tonawanda, Allegany, and Cattaraugus.

Ordering the &quot;particulars of the expedition&quot; would cement George Washington&#x27;s identity among the Iroquois as &quot;Hanödaga꞉nyas&quot; (Town Destroyer). In 1790, Cornplanter told Washington, &quot;When your army entered the Country of the Six Nations, we called you the Town-destroyer and to this day, when that name is heard, our women look behind them and turn pale, and our children cling close to the neck of their mothers.&quot; The name had been given to Washington decades earlier during the French and Indian War, while Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather John Washington had been given a similar appellation by the Susquehannock in 1675.

==Sullivan campaign as genocide==

A number of scholars have labelled the Sullivan campaign a genocide, arguing that Washington clearly intended to &quot;extirpate&quot; the Iroquois. Others, while acknowledging that aspects of the campaign were genocidal, prefer to use phrases like &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;

In &quot;Surviving Genocide&quot;, University of Oregon historian Jeffrey Ostler writes that historians &quot;are more inclined than they once were to gesture to particular actions, events, impulses, and effects as genocidal, but genocide has not become a key concept in scholarship.&quot; He notes that while some scholars have argued that Washington was well aware that the campaign would cause more than just dispossession, others have questioned whether Washington had genocidal intent since he ordered Sullivan to &quot;capture as many prisoners of every age and sex possible.&quot;

In her 2018 article, &quot;Hostile Nations: Quantifying the Destruction of the Sullivan-Clinton Genocide of 1779,&quot; Historian Rhiannon Koehler asserts that the campaign was an &quot;effort to wipe out the Iroquois as an entity and claim their lands.&quot; She dismisses the idea that Washington was acting in response to Indigenous raids, and insists that the orders Sullivan received were a clear indication of Washington&#x27;s genocidal intent to &quot;destroy the Haudenosaunee as an ethnic group.&quot;

Koehler&#x27;s article echoes the earlier work of Barbara Alice Mann. In &quot;George Washington&#x27;s War on Native Americans&quot;, Mann asserts that the Revolutionary War resulted in &quot;thousands and thousands of desperate and starving refugees fleeing the Continental Army and its ruthless militias.&quot; Mann states as unquestionable fact that Washington ordered attacks against the Iroquois so as to &quot;seize those lands under the cover of a war of liberation.&quot; According to Mann &quot;land, not reciprocation&quot; motivated the campaign. Mann diminishes or denies Iroquois culpability at the Battle of Oriskany, the Battle of Wyoming and the Cherry Valley Massacre, and stresses that Washington and his subordinates &quot;visited a holocaust upon the Indians.&quot; 

Mann&#x27;s work has been widely criticized. Military historian Joseph Fischer, author of &quot;A Well Executed Failure&quot;, wrote that &quot;George Washington&#x27;s War on Native Americans&quot; &quot;lacks balance and is insufficiently researched,&quot; and argued that her portrayal of the Sullivan campaign was seriously flawed. David Dixon, wrote that Mann&#x27;s book &quot;lacks objectivity and is, at times, punctuated by flawed interpretations and outright distortions.&quot; Frank Cogliano, Professor of American History at the University of Edinburgh, called it &quot;polemic rhetoric that renders it wholly inadequate as a history of this important subject,&quot; and notes Mann&#x27;s failure to cite seminal work on the topic, including Colin Calloway&#x27;s &quot;American Indians in the Revolution&quot; and Max Mintz&#x27;s &quot;Seeds of Empire&quot;.

==Indigenous casualties==

The Iroquois suffered a decrease in their population as a consequence of the Sullivan campaign. The magnitude of the decrease, however, has been the subject of considerable debate. Jeffrey Ostler estimates that the number killed by direct military action was around 200 (including some women and children), with as many as 1,000 later dying in refugee camps from starvation or disease. He observes that the death toll would have been higher had the Seneca and Cayuga chosen to defend their towns rather than evacuate them. The Seneca war chief Sayenqueraghta later explained, “we lost our Country it is true, but this was to secure our Women &amp; Children.”

In &quot;The American Revolution in Indian Country&quot;, Colin Calloway of Dartmouth University describes in detail the conditions at Fort Niagara following the Sullivan campaign. He estimated that &quot;several hundred&quot; succumbed that winter despite the best efforts of the British to supply clothing, blankets, provisions and medical care. Alan Taylor in &quot;The Divided Ground&quot; also reports &quot;several hundred&quot; deaths as does Rachel Herrmann of Cardiff University who uniquely describes the Sullivan campaign as &quot;victual warfare.&quot;

Koehler, on the other hand, claims that &quot;mass death was a reality of the campaign.&quot; She suggests that the overall death toll may have been a high as 55.5 percent or roughly 5,000 individuals. She bases this number on the questionable assumption that the 5,036 refugees at Fort Niagara in September 1779 represented every surviving Iroquois individual, and that at least 20 percent of the refugees died during the winter. Koehler further states that between 473 and 580 men, women and children died from direct military action, however, neither of the sources she cites appear to support her assertion.

==Commemoration==

To celebrate the centennial of the Sullivan expedition, a monument was erected in what is now Newtown Battlefield State Park in 1879. One of the speakers at the dedication ceremony was General William Tecumseh Sherman, famous for his March to the Sea during the American Civil War. In his speech, Sherman justified Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;scorched earth&quot; campaign and the displacement of Indigenous people by appealing to the widespread American 19th-century belief in manifest destiny. He told his audience, &quot;Wherever men raise up their hands to oppose this great advancing tide of civilization, they must be swept aside, peaceably if possible, forcibly if we must. The monument collapsed during a storm in 1911 and was replaced with the current monument the following year.

To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Sullivan expedition in 1929, New York&#x27;s state historian, Alexander Flick, successfully lobbied for the erection of thirty-five &quot;Route of the Armies&quot; monuments that marked the movements of Sullivan&#x27;s and Clinton&#x27;s forces in New York and Pennsylvania. The brass plaque mounted on each of the monoliths bears an inscription that perpetuates the false narrative that Sullivan &quot;did conquer the Indians and forever stopped their depredations.&quot; The inscription states that Sullivan and Clinton led &quot;an expedition against the hostile Indian nations which checked the aggression of the English and Indians on the frontiers of New York and Pennsylvania, extending westward the dominion of the United States.&quot; Similar markers were erected in Pennsylvania marking Sullivan&#x27;s route from Easton to Tioga. A number of other monuments were erected by various local organizations while a plethora of cast-iron roadside markers were placed by the New York State Education Department.
A major highlight of New York&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations were the three large pageants held at Elmira, Genesee and Canajoharie. Frick sought Iroquois involvement in the pageants and in the dozens of decidation ceremonies held across the state but was largely rebuked.

That same year, the United States Post Office issued a commemorative two-cent red stamp featuring a portrait of Major General Sullivan. 

Celebrations of the bicentennial of the Sullivan expedition in 1979 were far more subdued. The overall lack of interest may have been the result of a growing unwillingness to celebrate military victories against Indigenous peoples. The most significant event was the reenactment of the Battle of Newtown staged at Newtown Battlefield State Park. For the 225th anniversary, a much larger reenactment was staged. In recent years, reenactments have included the participation of both Indigenous and Canadian reenactors.

<doc id="339140" wikidata="Q7228" url="?curid=339140" title="Marquis of Haihun">
<text>Liu He (; – 8 September 59 BC) was briefly the ninth emperor of the Han dynasty. Originally King (or Prince) of Changyi (), he was installed by the powerful minister Huo Guang as emperor in 74 BC, but deposed only 27 days later, and omitted from the official list of emperors. He lost his original kingdom of Changyi and was demoted to the rank of marquis. He was given the new fief of Haihun in modern Jiangxi Province and became known as Marquis of Haihun (海昏侯).

== Background and career as King of Changyi ==
His grandfather was Emperor Wu of Han. His father, Liu Bo (劉髆), King Ai of Changyi (昌邑哀王) died in 88 BC, and he inherited his father&#x27;s kingdom in 86 BC. Historical records imply that he was a toddler at that time. Liu Bo was a son of Emperor Wu of Han. After Emperor Wu&#x27;s crown prince Liu Ju committed suicide in 91 BC, Liu Bo was among the candidates for the title of crown prince; the title ultimately went to young Liu Fuling, who succeeded Emperor Wu as Emperor Zhao of Han.

There are issues in gaining an accurate picture of Liu He and his life as King of Changyi because it is based on material written about him after he was deposed, and may be biased, fabricated, or both.

In his teenage years, the mayor of the kingdom&#x27;s capital, Wang Ji (王吉), offered honest criticism of Liu He&#x27;s inappropriate behaviour, urging him to be more studious and humble. Liu He appreciated Wang&#x27;s report and rewarded him, but did not change his ways. Similarly, when Liu He associated with people of ill reputation who engaged in vulgarity and wasteful spending, the commander of his guards, Gong Sui (龔遂) begged him to change his ways, and Liu He agreed, but soon after dismissed the guards that Gong had recommended and brought his previous companions back. Gong could do nothing about it.

== Accession to the throne ==
When Prince He&#x27;s uncle Emperor Zhao died in 74 BC without a son, the regent Huo Guang rejected Liu Xu (劉胥), the Prince of Guangling and the only surviving son of Emperor Wu, from the succession, because Emperor Wu himself did not favour Prince Xu. He therefore turned to Prince He, who was Emperor Wu&#x27;s grandson. Prince He was very pleased with this decision, and immediately departed from his capital Shanyang (山陽, in modern Jining, Shandong) and headed for the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an, at such a frenetic pace that his guards&#x27; horses fell dead from exhaustion. Wang Ji urged him against racing at such speed, reasoning that it was inappropriate during a time of mourning, but Prince He brushed aside the suggestion. Along the way, he ordered local government officials to offer him a special kind of chicken (known for their ability to crow for a long time) and women. (During periods of mourning, he would have been required to abstain from sexual relations.) When Gong confronted him about it, he blamed it on the director of his slaves, who was then executed.

When Prince He arrived at the capital, he first stayed at the Changyi mission to the capital. He then attended a formal session of mourning for Emperor Zhao, before accepting the throne.

== Brief reign as emperor ==
Once he became emperor, Prince He immediately began to give rapid promotions to his subordinates from Changyi. He also failed to observe the period of mourning properly. Rather he feasted day and night and went out on tours. Gong became concerned, but was unable to get Prince He to change his ways.

Prince He&#x27;s behaviour as emperor surprised and disappointed Huo Guang, who pondered his options. At the suggestion of the agricultural minister Tian Yannian (田延年), Huo began to consider deposing the new emperor. He consulted with General Zhang Anshi (張安世) and Prime Minister Yang Chang (楊敞), who agreed to the plan; Yang agreed upon the urgings of his wife Sima Ying, a daughter of Sima Qian.

== Removal from the throne ==
Just 27 days into the new emperor&#x27;s reign, Huo and the other officials deposed him. They summoned a meeting of high level officials and announced the plan to depose the emperor, forcing those other officials to go along with the plan or be killed. In a group, they went to Empress Dowager Shangguan&#x27;s palace to report to her about Prince He&#x27;s offences and their plan. She agreed with their plan, and ordered that Prince He&#x27;s Changyi subordinates be immediately barred from the palace. These subordinates (some 200 individuals) were then arrested by Zhang. She then summoned Prince He, who did not know what was going to happen. He only knew something was wrong when he saw Empress Dowager Shangguan seated on her throne and wearing a formal dress made of jewels, and the officials lined up next to her.

Huo and the top officials then offered their articles of impeachment against Prince He, and these articles were read out loud to the Empress Dowager. Empress Dowager Shangguan verbally rebuked Prince He. The articles of impeachment listed as the main offences (in a total of 1127 examples of misconduct) that Prince He committed during his 27-day reign as an emperor:

* Refusal to abstain from meat and sex during the period of mourning
* Failure to keep the imperial safe secure
* Improperly promoting and rewarding his Changyi subordinates during the period of mourning
* Engaging in feasts and games during the period of mourning
* Offering sacrifices to his father during the period of mourning for his uncle

Empress Dowager Shangguan approved the articles of impeachment and ordered Prince He deposed. He was then transported under heavy guard back to the Changyi mission. Both Prince He and Huo offered personal apologies to each other.

== Post-reign life ==
As part of the articles of impeachment, the officials asked that Empress Dowager Shangguan to exile Prince He to a remote location. However, she did not do so, but rather returned him to Changyi without any titles, although he was given a small fief of 2,000 families who would pay tribute to him. His four sisters were also awarded smaller fiefs of 1,000 families each.

Prince He&#x27;s Changyi subordinates were accused of failing to keep his behaviour in check and were almost all executed. Wang and Gong were spared because of their prior advice to him, but were ordered to undergo hard labour. The only other official spared was Prince He&#x27;s teacher Wang Shi (王式), who successfully argued that he tried to use his teachings of poems to show Prince He what was proper and what was improper. Some historians argued that the reason why the Changyi officials were dealt with so harshly was that Huo was convinced that they were plotting with Prince He to have him killed, but there is no conclusive evidence of either such a plot or that the harsh treatment was as the result of such a plot or suspected plot.

Huo later settled on Liu Bingyi (劉病已), the commoner grandson of the former Crown Prince Liu Ju, an uncle of Prince He, as the new emperor, and he ascended to the throne 27 days later as Emperor Xuan. For years, although Prince He was powerless and without titles, Emperor Xuan was suspicious of him, but a report by Zhang Chang (張敞), the governor of the Commandery of Shanyang, in 64 BC, in which Zhang downplayed Prince He&#x27;s level of intelligence, alleviated those concerns.

In 63 BC, Emperor Xuan made Prince He the Marquess of Haihun, a county located in modern Jiangxi. It is considered that Emperor Xuan continued to be concerned about Prince He despite Zhang&#x27;s report, and therefore chose to send him far away from his former principality. Prince He died in 59 BC as a marquess, survived by 16 wives and 22 children. His son Liu Daizong (劉代宗) was not initially allowed to inherit his title, but ultimately was allowed to do so during the reign of Emperor Yuan.

== Tomb ==

The tomb of Marquis of Haihun was found in 2011 and the excavation is ongoing. The tomb is located in the northern part of Xinjian in Jiangxi, in a cemetery that contains in total of nine tombs. About 20,000 artifacts have been unearthed from the tomb. Among the unearthed artifacts, there are more than 300 gold objects, 2 million copper coins, and a mirror containing the earliest known image of Confucius. In 2019, scholar Jue Guo contested the prevailing identification of the artifact as a “dressing mirror,” claiming it was in fact a talisman. Also the long lost Qi version of the &quot;Analects&quot; was found in the tomb. An application has been submitted for the tomb of the Marquis of Haihun to be listed as a World Heritage Site.

In the over 5200 bamboo slips found in the tomb, archaeologists have found remnants of an edict by Emperor Xuan of Han regarding the disestablishment of the fief of Haihun following the Marquis and his sons&#x27; deaths. Some of the information that has come to light is not recorded in history books such as the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, including the exact date of the Marquis&#x27; death, 8 September 59BC. The slips also mention that the fief of Haihun was struck by numerous natural disasters, including floods and drought. The slips also mention a report by the governor of Yuzhang regarding the distestablishment of the fief, which corresponds with the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. It has been calculated from the slips that the time between the deaths of the Marquis and his sons and the disestablishment of the fief was less than 40 days.

The disestablishment process of the fief of Haihun was markedly different from the disestablishments of other fiefs. For example, in September 112BC, Emperor Wu of Han issued an edict disestablishing the fiefdoms of over 100 marquises without discussion at court. The fief of Haihun, however, went through a process of lengthy discussion with court officials, and the final disestablishment edict had over 100 officials sign their name, including &#x27;Cheng Xiang&#x27; (Chancellor) Bing Ji and &#x27;Yushi Daifu&#x27; (Attorney General) Xiao Wangzhi.

== Textual content of the Marquis&#x27; tomb ==
According to preliminary studies, the tomb contains manuscripts with more or less partial overlapping with the following: the &quot;Book of Odes&quot;, the &quot;Analects&quot;, the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety,&quot; and the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. Other texts from the tomb are:

* the &quot;Bao fu&quot; 保傅, whose content was previously known from chapters in the &quot;Liji&quot; 禮記 and &quot;Da dai liji&quot; 大戴禮記;
* circa ten strips on morality, tentatively titled as &quot;Li yi jian&quot; 禮儀簡 (&quot;Writings on rituals and morality&quot;); 
* a text titled by the editors &quot;Dao wang fu&quot; 悼亡賦, whose content is hard to interpret, but seems related to expressions of mourning; 
* a text covering the game &quot;Liubo&quot; 六博, a topic discussed in other manuscripts from the Warring States era; 
* a series of strips on divinations. One group has been gather together under the title of &quot;Yi zhan&quot; 易占, for their content on divination (including names and hexagrams).

== Tomb&#x27;s artifacts ==
The journal &quot;Cultural Relics&quot; 文物 has begun publishing articles that introduce the content of the tomb. Two articles published in 2022 introduce the recovery of:

* A dozen shields (90 cm by 50 cm), found on the southern end of the main tomb, on both the right and left sides, together with long wooden poles. The shields have been found shattered in pieces, and were recomposed by scholars. Two of them depict a dragon; one portrays two humans seemingly engaged in a fight with two animals, and has a short inscription reporting the material that went into the production of the shield, its cost, and year of production. This practice of recording the value of the object on the object itself is attested in Han culture.
* Two screens. One screen presents a mirror on one side, identified as a dressing mirror (approximately 96 cm tall by 68 cm across). The bronze mirror is framed by representations identified King Father of the East 東王公, Queen Mother of the West 西王母, and the “Four spirits” 四神. Two pieces of wood decorated with cranes were also found, badly preserved. It is suggested that these were folding panels originally attached to cover the mirror. The verso side has representations of Confucius and his disciples, with their biographies written around the depictions. Guo Jue had argued that this object was in fact a talisman not used in daily-life by the owner. Given the inscription on the object itself, this initial identification appears now incorrect. 
* A second screen has been recovered, but it is heavily fragmented due to the screens being located close to where the robbers first entered the tomb prior to a proper archeological excavation. Two human figures can be identified, under a brief inscription. This has been interpreted by Huang Kejia 黄可佳 by taking the mirror as representative of the household. 
* A drum support, with an animal figure as its stand.

<doc id="339147" wikidata="Q14891" url="?curid=339147" title="Suhl">
<text>Suhl () is a city in Thuringia, Germany, located SW of Erfurt, NE of Würzburg and N of Nuremberg. With its 37,000 inhabitants, it is the smallest of the six urban districts within Thuringia. Together with its northern neighbour-town Zella-Mehlis, Suhl forms the largest urban area in the Thuringian Forest with a population of 46,000. The region around Suhl is marked by up to 1,000-meter-high mountains, including Thuringia&#x27;s highest peak, the Großer Beerberg (983 m), approximately NE of the city centre.

Suhl was first mentioned in 1318 and stayed a small mining and metalworking town, until industrialization broke through in late 19th century and Suhl became a centre of Germany&#x27;s arms production, specialized on rifles and guns with companies such as Sauer &amp; Sohn. Furthermore, the engineering industry was based in Suhl with Simson, a famous car and moped producer. In 1952, Suhl became one of East Germany&#x27;s 14 district capitals, which led to a government-directed period of urban growth and conversion. Its results – a typical 1960s concrete architecture-marked city centre – are defining to the present. With the loss of its administrative and industrial functions, Suhl saw a lasting period of urban decline starting in 1990.

Suhl is known for its sportsmen, especially in shooting, winter sports, and volleyball.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Though first appearing in a 1318 deed, several entries in the annals of Fulda Abbey already mentioned a place named &quot;Sulaha&quot; between 900 and 1155 AD. The coat of arms from 1365 shows two hammers, indicating the city&#x27;s most important livelihood: metal processing. The region belonged to the territories held by the Franconian counts of Henneberg since the 11th century. Suhl was located on an important trade route from Gotha, Erfurt and Arnstadt passing the Thuringian Forest mountain range at Oberhof and continuing to the Henneberg&#x27;s residence, Schleusingen.

=== Early modern period ===
From 1500 onwards, the Henneberg lands belonged to the Franconian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire. Suhl has been a &quot;Flecken&quot; (small market town) since 1445 and the full municipal rights were granted in 1527, making Suhl one of the youngest cities in present-day Thuringia. Iron ore mining created the basis for the development of Suhl as a centre of gunsmith trade.

The Reformation was introduced in 1544. Several witch-hunts took place in the area from 1553 until the late 17th century. When the Henneberg counts became extinct in 1583, Suhl passed to the Wettin electors of Saxony, where it remained until 1815. Unlike most of present Thuringia, it didn&#x27;t belong to the Ernestine line of the Wettins, but to the Albertine cadet branch of Saxe-Zeitz from 1660, so that it had been a Saxonian and later Prussian exclave within Thuringia for nearly 300 years.

During the 16th century, iron mining and metalworking saw a boom, finished by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when marauding Croat mercenaries under Imperial general Johann Ludwig Hektor von Isolani burnt down the city in 1634. From about 1690, Duke Moritz Wilhelm of Saxe-Zeitz supported the reconstruction of Suhl as a mining town.

=== Since 1815 ===
The Congress of Vienna in 1815 led to the Saxonian loss of Suhl, which became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony, where it remained from 1815 to 1944 and again shortly in 1945. Staying an exclave within Ernestine territories, Suhl was part of the Schleusingen district until the dissolution of Prussia in 1945.

The later 19th century brought the connection to the railway in 1882 and the industrialisation of the metalworking business. About 1920, Suhl has been a centre of left-wing revolutionary groups, so that the Reichswehr occupied the city (and the neighbour-town Zella-Mehlis) during the Kapp Putsch and ended the workers uprising. After 1935, the military industry saw another boom, caused by the Nazi armament. About 10,000 forced labourers had to work in the city&#x27;s arms industry after 1940.

The US Army reached Suhl on 3 April 1945 and was replaced by Soviet troops on 1 July 1945. At the same year, Suhl became part of Thuringia, which was replaced by three Bezirks in 1952. Suhl became the capital of the south-western Bezirk Suhl, reaching from Bad Salzungen in the north-west to Sonneberg in the south-east with a population of 550,000. During the GDR period, the upgraded city saw rapid urban growth, which is defining until today.

After the German reunification in 1990, Suhl lost its administrative functions when Thuringia was refounded and replaced the Bezirks. Furthermore, the industry collapsed. Both led to a structural crises, which isn&#x27;t overcome yet. The population of Suhl declined about 35% since 1988.

=== History of arms production ===
The metal processing of Suhl naturally led, during the Renaissance, to other major local industries, including gunsmithing and armoring. Suhl was a major producer of cannons throughout the seventeenth and subsequent centuries, and Suhl cannons were used by many European powers. A major arms company that was located in Suhl for almost 200 years was J.P. Sauer und Sohn GmbH, producer of hunting rifles, shotguns, and pistols, such as the Sauer 38H, until moving operations to Eckernförde at the end of World War II.

Other prominent firearms manufacturers in Suhl included:

* Simson (also known as BSW and then Gustloff Werke under Nazi rule and Ernst Thälmann Suhl under Communist rule)
* Waffenfabrik August Menz, noted for having produced in the 1920s the Liliput pistol, one of the smallest semiautomatic handguns ever made. 
* C.G. Haenel
* The largest manufacturer producing firearms currently in Suhl is Merkel GmbH, which make both rifles and shotguns.

During the Cold War, the East German national shooting arena was located at Suhl, and hosted many top-level competitions, including the 1986 ISSF World Championships. Although surpassed in this respect in the unified Germany by the Olympic shooting centre at Munich, Suhl remains an important place to the sport. It hosts Germany&#x27;s only school for armorers, and a well equipped museum of weapons.

==Geography==
===Topography and geology===
Suhl is located on the south-western edge of the Thuringian Forest. To the south-west, the Small Thuringian Forest (some foothills of the Thuringian forest) is situated. The terrain is mountainous to all directions, some important mountains are: the Großer Beerberg (983 m, highest one in Thuringia) in the north-east, the Ringberg (745 m), the Döllberg (760 m), the Friedberg (649 m) and the Adlersberg (859 m) in the east, the Steinsburg (641 m) in the south, the Heiliger Berg (513 m), the Domberg (675 m) and the Berg Bock (709 m) in the north-west as well as the Bocksberg (609 m) and the Hoheloh (526 m) within the city. The centre itself is located in an elevation of 450 m and nearly the complete non-build on part of the municipal territory is forested. There are a few small rivers running through Suhl: The Hasel rises at Friedberg in the south-east and runs westward through Suhl, Heinrichs, Mäbendorf, Dietzhausen and Wichtshausen. The Lauter rises on the southern slope of Großer Beerberg mountain and runs through Goldlauter, Lauter and the city centre, before it joins the Hasel behind the station. The Mühlwasser rises on the western slope of Großer Beerberg and runs southward through the northern city parts before it joins the Lauter at the northern city centre.

Suhl sits on the southern edge of the &quot;Suhler Scholle,&quot; an upthrust granite complex that is streaked by numerous dikes. This is part of the Ruhla-Schleusingen Horst that defines the southwest side of the Thuringian Forest. The southwest side of the &quot;Suhler Scholle&quot; abuts horizontal sedimentary layers, Buntsandstein (sandstone from the Triassic period) over Zechstein (evaporite deposits from the Permian period). The granite of the &quot;Suhler Scholle&quot; is capped with Permian sediments and igneous deposits. The higher hills to the northeast are part of the &quot;Beerberg Scholle&quot;, an irregularly cracked mass of quartz porphyry from the later Permian period.

A band of iron ores follows the fault dividing the &quot;Suhler Scholle&quot; from the sedimentary rocks to the southwest, while the copper and silver deposits are to the northeast in the Permian deposits above the &quot;Suhler Scholle.&quot; Southeast of town, there is a significant uranium deposit in the &quot;Buntsandstein&quot;.

===Administrative division===
Suhl abuts the following municipalities: Geratal, Elgersburg and Ilmenau within Ilm-Kreis district in the north-east, Nahetal-Waldau, Sankt Kilian, Eichenberg, Grub, Oberstadt and Schmeheim within Hildburghausen district in the south, Dillstädt and Schwarza in the west as well as Benshausen and Zella-Mehlis in the north within Schmalkalden-Meiningen district.

Some villages were incorporated during the 20th and 21st century to form the present-day districts of Suhl:

* Albrechts (incorporated in 1994)
* Dietzhausen (1994)
* Gehlberg (2019)
* Goldlauter (1979)
* Heidersbach (1979)
* Heinrichs (1936)
* Mäbendorf (1979)
* Neundorf (also: &quot;Suhler Neundorf&quot;, 1936) 
* Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig (2019)
* Vesser (1994)
* Wichtshausen (1994)

===Cityscape===

Suhl&#x27;s cityscape is marked by the lack of flat ground to build on, which is why the city&#x27;s morphology appears picked and incoherent. The city centre developed during the Middle Ages around the Marktplatz and the Steinweg (as main street) next to the confluence of &quot;Lauter&quot; and &quot;Rimbach&quot; river. Later, the city grew to the east and south to the bordering hills and valleys. After World War II, Suhl became the capital of one of the 14 Bezirks in the GDR in 1952. During the following decades, the city doubled its population, many Plattenbau settlements developed at the periphery and the centre got largely converted. The old town around Friedrich-König-Straße was demolished during the 1960s, as were the quarters east of Topfmarkt later. They were rebuilt with contemporary concrete architecture and Plattenbau buildings. The new city centre with all the important public buildings was developed around Friedrich-König-Straße, even with large-scale high-rise buildings. After the reunification, the population shrunk heavily, leading to high vacancy rates. The government reacted to this by demolishing some of the Plattenbau settlements at the periphery; some buildings stood only for 20 years. Compared with other East German cities, the fight against vacancy was simpler in Suhl, because vacancy was concentrated at the periphery and not in the city centre (as in the most older cities in East Germany), which made it easy to demolish and renature the areas. A larger problem is vacancy in shops in the city centre, because the retail sector in Suhl has also been in a crisis for many years.

==Demographics==

¹ Census

The area around Suhl was settled during the later Middle Ages, nevertheless, Suhl stayed a village resp. small town of 1,000 to 2,000 inhabitants during this period. The growth of proto-industrial manufacturing businesses in 17th and 18th century led to a first increase of population up to 6,000 around 1800. During the following decades, the industrial revolution in other German regions led to an economic crisis in Suhl, because of the bad traffic conditions for exporting products. Nevertheless, the population grew further to 10,000 in the 1880s, as the city got finally connected to the railway. Compared to other upcoming cities in Germany, the growth of population stayed slight until 1935, as Suhl counted 15,000 inhabitants. Then, the arm production for World War II brought an economic boom to Suhl and a growth of population up to 26,000 in 1940, which stayed the same until the early 1960s. Between 1960 and 1988, the population grew up to 56,000, forced by the government&#x27;s expansion of Suhl as a capital of one of the 14 Bezirks in GDR. After the reunification in 1990, the city lost its administrative and economic functions, which led to an extreme decline in population. It shrunk to 48,000 in 2000 and 36,000 in 2012. With a decline of more than 35% since 1988, Suhl is among the heaviest shrinking cities in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.68% p. a, which is faster than in bordering rural regions. Suburbanization played only a small role in Suhl. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Suhl to search a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like Erfurt, Jena or Leipzig. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is getting a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it yet. Urban planning activities to tear down unused flats led to a relatively low vacancy rate of 8% (according to 2011 EU census), compared with a loss in population of more than 35% since 1988.

The birth deficit was 207 in 2012, this is −5.8 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: −4.5; national average: −2.4). The net migration rate was −11.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: −0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important target regions of Suhl migrants are other Thuringian regions like Erfurt, Jena and Eisenach same as the western German conurbations.

Like other eastern German cities, Suhl has only a small amount of foreign population: around 1.5% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 3.9% are migrants (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Suhl are Russians and Vietnamese people. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 16% in 2006 to 7% in 2013, which is one of the lowest rates among Thuringia&#x27;s major cities. Due to the official atheism in former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 12.6% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

==Politics==
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Martin Kummer of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2006. He was succeeded by independent Jens Triebel from 2006 to 2018. André Knapp of the CDU was elected in 2018, and has since served as mayor. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, and the results were as follows:

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Agriculture, industry and services===

Agriculture plays no role in Suhl, only 17% of the municipal territory are in agricultural use. The soil isn&#x27;t very fertile and the climate is harsh, the most cultivated strains are maize and rapeseed, furthermore there is cattle farming on some areas. On the other hand, 63% of the territory are forest, so that wood production plays a role in Suhl.

Suhl&#x27;s industry has always been based on metalworking. In the past, the city was a leading arms producer in Germany and the vehicle production was another pillar of the local industry. After the reunification in 1990, the industry collapsed and the most factories got closed. Important companies of today are &quot;CDA&quot;, a producer of data replication media, &quot;Zimbo&quot;, a meat producer, &quot;Gramss&quot;, an industrial bakery, &quot;Paragon&quot;, a car parts supplier, and &quot;Merkel&quot;, the last remained arms producer in Suhl. In 2012, there were 27 companies in industrial production with more than 20 workers employing 2,000 persons and generating a turnover of €295 million.

Services in Suhl are including the typical regional supply (like retail, hospital, cinema etc.) and some preserved administrative functions over the surrounding districts like the Industrie- und Handelskammer and the regional centres of Arbeitsagentur and Rentenversicherung. Furthermore, tourism plays a role because of the beautiful landscape around. In 2012, there were 93,000 hotel guests having 245,000 overnight stays in Suhl.

===Transport===
Suhl connected to the railway quite late, because of its hilly terrain. The Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway through the city was opened in 1882 (southern direction to Würzburg) and in 1884 (northern direction to Erfurt). It was one of only few main mountain railways in Prussia with the large, long Brandleite Tunnel north of the city. Later, this railway became an important link between Berlin and south-western Germany, until the inner-German border cut it off in 1949. Since that time, there is only regional traffic on the line (except a short time in 1990s with long-distance trains). The express train runs every two hours to Erfurt in the north and Würzburg in the south, where connections to long-distance trains are given. Furthermore, there are local trains to Erfurt and Meiningen, running also every two hours, so that there is overall a connection once an hour in both directions. Another railway to Schleusingen was opened in 1911 and closed in 1997. With a gradient of nearly 7%, it was one of the steepest regular railways in Germany. Stations in Suhl besides the main station are located in Heinrichs and Dietzhausen, whereas the Stations Suhler Neundorf and Friedberg at the Schleusingen line are abandoned.

Suhl is situated at the junction of Bundesautobahn 71 (Erfurt–Würzburg) and Bundesautobahn 73 (Suhl–Nuremberg). Both got opened during the 2000s and host some impressive bridges and tunnels around Suhl, like the Rennsteig Tunnel in the north and the 82 m high &quot;Haseltalbrücke&quot; at Heinrichs district. A Bundesstraße through Suhl was the Bundesstraße 247 from Gotha in the north to Schleusingen in the south. It was annulled after the opening of both Autobahns and is now a secondary road. Other important secondary roads run to Meiningen in the west and Ilmenau in the east.

Biking is getting more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourism serve the &quot;Hasel track&quot; from Suhl to the Werra valley near Meiningen. Furthermore, there are some mountainbiking tracks within the Thuringian Forest.

Public transport is carried out by a bus line network connecting the city centre with the outskirts, Zella-Mehlis and neighbouring villages. A trolleybus system was planned during the late 1980s, but not realized after the reunification.

==Education==
There is only one Gymnasium school left in Suhl, after others were closed due to the decline of the number of children after 1990.

==Culture==
There are some museums and other cultural institutions in Suhl:

* The &quot;Waffenmuseum&quot; at Friedrich-König-Straße shows an exhibition about the history of arms production in Suhl.
* The &quot;Fahrzeugmuseum&quot; at Kongresszentrum hosts an exhibition of vehicles produced by Simson.

* The municipal orchestra, founded in 1953 and based in the &quot;Kulturhaus&quot; at Friedrich-König-Straße was closed in 2009.

The most significant sights in Suhl are:

* St. Mary&#x27;s Church is the evangelical main parish church of Suhl, built between 1753 and 1756 in late-Baroque style 
* The Holy Cross Church is the second evangelical parish church at Steinweg, built between 1731 and 1739 in Baroque style. 
* The Holy Cross Chapel behind the eponymous church is one of the oldest buildings in Suhl, established in 1618 Gothic style. 
* The town hall at Marktplatz was built between 1812 and 1817 and modified in 1913 to Neo-Baroque style. 
* The &quot;Malzhaus&quot; at Friedrich-König-Straße was built around 1650 and hosts the &quot;Waffenmusuem&quot; today. 
* The &quot;Kulturhaus&quot; at Friedrich-König-Straße was built in 1957 in Neo-Classicist style and demolished in 2013. Only the façade and the lobby remained. 
* Some buildings of the former Simson factory between the Heinrichs and Mäbendorf districts in Bauhaus-modern architecture of 1920s and 1930s remained. 
* The new municipal library at Bahnhofstraße was built in 2004 in form of a glass cube. 
* Some older buildings remained in the district of &quot;Heinrichs&quot; (including the church, town hall and some picturesque timber-framed houses) west of the city centre.

<doc id="339148" wikidata="Q153381" url="?curid=339148" title="Kiro Gligorov">
<text>Kiro Gligorov (, ; 3 May 1917 – 1 January 2012) was a Macedonian statesman, economist, and politician who served as the first president of the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) from 1991 to 1999. He was born and raised in Štip, where he was also educated. He continued his education in Skopje and graduated in law in Belgrade. During World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia, he worked as a lawyer and participated in the partisan resistance. By the end of the war, he was an organiser of the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, the predecessor of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia as a federal Yugoslav state.

After the war, he served in various positions in Yugoslavia. For decades, he was a high-ranking official and an economist there. Prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, Gligorov was an adviser for Ante Marković&#x27;s market reform plan. Gligorov later played a pivotal role in Macedonia&#x27;s peaceful secession from Yugoslavia and its international recognition. In 1995, he survived an assassination attempt, of which the perpetrators have not been found. For his role in its independence and political development, international researchers and the Macedonian public regard him as the father of the Macedonian state.

== Early life ==

Kiro Gligorov was born in Štip on 3 May 1917, in the Bulgarian occupation zone of Serbia (now North Macedonia) during World War I, where he received his initial education. According to the news source &quot;Novinite&quot;, his father was a craftsman, and his mother was a housewife. Gligorov completed his secondary education in Skopje and later graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School. Before World War II, he participated in the Macedonian communist student movement. When he was twenty, he was arrested by the Royal Yugoslav authorities for his political opposition to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but was released afterwards.

After the defeat of Yugoslavia by Axis forces in 1941, Gligorov returned to Skopje (then annexed by Bulgaria), where he worked as a lawyer until 1943. In 1942, Gligorov was arrested by Bulgarian police on the accusation that he was a pro-Serbian communist. He was released on the orders of Skopje Mayor Spiro Kitinchev, who guaranteed that he was a trustworthy Bulgarian citizen, of ethnic Bulgarian origin. During World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia, he joined the partisans and participated in the resistance. In 1943, he became a member of the (ANOK), a group of the Communist Party of Macedonia which advocated for a United Macedonia. Along with other communist activists and activists of the group, he saw the Macedonian Question as a pan-Balkan issue and its solution in the creation of a Balkan Federation. Afterwards he became a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY), Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) and Antifascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM). In ASNOM, he served as a secretary of the Initiative committee for its organisation and a finance commissioner in its presidium. On 2 August 1944, he took part in the first session of ASNOM as a delegate.

== Politics ==

=== Yugoslavia ===

After World War II, Gligorov moved to Belgrade. Between 1945 and 1947, he held the office of Assistant Secretary General of the Presidency of the Government of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. He then served as Assistant Minister of Finance from 1947 to 1952. After this year, he held several positions: Assistant Chairman of the Economic Council of the Government of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia from 1952 to 1953, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Economic Planning from 1953 to 1955, and Secretary of Economy - Coordinator in the Federal Government in 1956.

As a finance minister, he advanced early Yugoslav economic reform. Gligorov supervised the shift from a centrally planned economy to the enduring Yugoslav worker&#x27;s councils. Managers and banks, rather than the state, would ensure budgetary discipline, even if this might bring the former into conflict with the workers they were supposed to represent.

Under his predecessor&#x27;s administration, companies had found themselves starved for capital, and misappropriated social insurance funds to purchase necessary improvements. Gligorov hoped that the shift to a market system would temporarily reduce consumption of wage goods to a sustainable level, while also stimulating investment into their production. Cuts in public expenditures attempted to release working capital to manufacturers, and a devalued Yugoslav dinar should improve their export competitiveness.

He and fellow Yugoslav politician Boris Kidrič established &quot;Ekonomska politika&quot; (Economic policy) in 1952, a Belgrade weekly newspaper, with the aim of promoting socialist market economy as an alternative to Soviet-style centrally planned economy. The newspaper became very influential, particularly among large Yugoslav firms, who were among its subscribers and supporters.

In the 1960s, he had the reputation of being a liberal economist and politician who wanted to implement market-oriented reforms. Along with another Macedonian politician Krste Crvenkovski, he spoke out in favour of decentralisation. He thought that republican control over federal policy making was necessary. Gligorov was the Finance Minister of Yugoslavia from 1962 to 1967. In 1965, he was the co-creator of a marketisation program which was never implemented, because the plan was considered too liberal by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. In this period, he was also a close collaborator of Tito.

He and his son Vladimir Gligorov in the 1970s published articles in the newspaper &quot;Ekonomska politika&quot; along with other reform-oriented economists, journalists, managers, and politicians such as Dragiša Bošković, , Ante Marković, Jože Mencinger, Stjepan Mesić, Milutin Mitrović, Marko Nikezić, Latinka Perović, Žarko Puhovski, Dragan Veselinov, and Veselin Vukotić, most of whom influenced Yugoslav economic and political thinking. Gligorov held various other high-ranking positions in the political establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including as a member of both the Yugoslav state presidency and the party presidency (for the 9th and 10th electoral terms), as well as President of the Assembly of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 15 May 1974 to 15 May 1978. In the 1980s, Gligorov was a critic of the subjective causes of the Yugoslav economic difficulties. He opined that the difficulties stemmed from &quot;suppressing market laws and operating in a subjectivist way in which social and economic goals and plans were formulated not on the basis of our realistic possibilities, but rather on what our Socialist society would like to achieve.&quot; In 1989, he was an adviser for Ante Marković&#x27;s economic reform plan, which consisted of economic liberalisation, privatisation, the devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar and its pegging to the German mark, making it convertible.

=== Macedonia ===
He returned to Skopje in 1989. In February 1990, he joined the Macedonian Forum for Preparation of a Macedonian National Program. Gligorov actively participated in the work of this forum, along with Vladimir Gligorov, which discussed the status of the Yugoslav Federation and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Following the promulgation of the Declaration of Sovereignty of the State on 25 January 1991 and an initiative by a group of prominent liberal politicians and intellectuals called the &quot;Young Lions&quot;, Gligorov was elected as the president of SR Macedonia by a large majority in the Macedonian Assembly on 27 January, succeeding Vladimir Mitkov. Ljubčo Georgievski, then the leader of VMRO-DPMNE, was elected to serve as the vice president of Macedonia, but he resigned from that position in October 1991, complaining that he and his party were politically marginalised, despite being the largest political faction. Gligorov dedicated himself to the realisation of a three-point plan: Yugoslavia&#x27;s preservation through a peaceful resolution of the crisis; the creation of a parliamentary democracy with the adoption of a new constitution and the promotion of national minorities&#x27; rights.

On 7 March, he entrusted the mandate to Nikola Kljusev to form the first government. In the same year, Gligorov along with Alija Izetbegović put forward the idea of a &quot;Yugoslav confederation&quot; (which was strongly supported by the international community), but it was rejected by the other states of Yugoslavia. Thus his policy of preserving Yugoslavia as a confederation failed. When it became clear that Yugoslavia was being torn apart, Gligorov and the other leaders decided to initiate a referendum for independence on 8 September 1991. Many citizens ended up opting for independence, although the referendum was also boycotted by many members of the ethnic Serb and Albanian communities in the country. Under his rule, Macedonia became the only state which seceded from Yugoslavia peacefully. After independence, he became the first President of the independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia. Afterwards, Gligorov worked towards gaining international recognition of Macedonia.

Domestically, Gligorov faced the challenge of finding a balance between two opposing political forces - the ethnic Macedonian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) and the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP). He tried to balance the exclusionary demands of the nationalists with the inclusionary demands of the ethnic Albanian parties. Gligorov was of the opinion that Albanians, a substantial ethnic group in the country, would always have a share in the governing of Macedonia and he firmly supported power-sharing with them. After Kljusev&#x27;s government failed to secure international recognition in 1992, he asked Georgievski to form a new government, but he failed. Gligorov then gave the mandate to Branko Crvenkovski, who formed a coalition government, which also included two ethnic Albanian parties such as the Party for Democratic Prosperity and National Democratic Party. Under his monitoring, Crvenkovski and the leaders of the ethnic Albanian parties worked together to resolve issues that divided ethnic Macedonians and Albanians.

Economically, he was leading Macedonia towards full economic privatisation, while also trying to reach agreements with international financial institutions to receive funds for the economic transition. In 1992, he successfully negotiated the withdrawal of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) from Macedonian soil. Due to concerns of the Yugoslav Wars spilling over into Macedonia, he requested the presence of UN peacekeepers, which were deployed later. As a result of the Macedonia naming dispute, the Republic of Macedonia was admitted into the United Nations under the reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&quot; Gligorov delivered his first speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations on 7 April 1993. In the general election, he was re-elected President of the Republic by a majority of votes, on 16 October 1994. On 12 September 1995, he signed the Interim Accord for the normalisation of relations with Greece at the United Nations Headquarters. On 2 October, in Belgrade, he signed a recognition agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1998, Georgievski became the prime minister of Macedonia. The election for Gligorov&#x27;s successor took place only a few days before the end of his term. He served as the president until 19 November 1999 and was succeeded by Boris Trajkovski. Following his presidency, he retired from politics.

== Assassination attempt ==

On 3 October 1995, Gligorov was the target of a car bomb assassination attempt in Skopje. Disobeying instructions from his security advisers to sit in the back seat of his presidential car, he sat next to his driver. While en route from his residence to his office, the car was blown up by an explosion from a parked vehicle, killing his driver and a passer-by, as well as injuring several other passers-by and his security officer. Gligorov was seriously injured and was immediately transported to the hospital. The parked car contained an explosive which was activated remotely. Two persons in their mid-twenties were arrested immediately after the incident.

An investigation into the assassination attempt was initiated and police experienced in terrorism investigations from Britain, United States, Greece and Germany also came to Macedonia to participate. There have been no suspects determined and no progress has been made in the investigation. However, there have been short-lived speculations as to who could be the culprits. Shortly after the bombing, the Minister of Internal Affairs Ljubomir Frčkovski publicly claimed that &quot;a powerful multinational company from a neighbouring country&quot; was behind the assassination attempt, with the Macedonian media pointing at the Bulgarian Multigroup and the Serbian Secret Service as possible suspects. During a meeting between Multigroup head Iliya Pavlov and Gligorov in Ohrid, Pavlov assured Gligorov that his organisation was not involved.

Gligorov was incapacitated until 17 November 1995. He became permanently blind in one eye and was facially scarred as a result of the attack. Stojan Andov was acting president during Gligorov&#x27;s recuperation. After several months of treatment, on 10 January 1996, Gligorov returned to his presidency.

== Personal life and death ==

In October 1943, Gligorov married Nada Misheva, who died in 2009. They had one son and two daughters. His son, Vladimir Gligorov, was one of the founders of the Democratic Party in Serbia. After his retirement from politics, he authored several memoirs and founded the Kiro Gligorov Foundation to publish his works, maintain his archives and serve as a think tank with an interest in studying the development of multi-ethnic societies. In an interview for &quot;Vjesnik&quot; on 22 March 2001, he dismissed the Albanian demands for greater rights by claiming that they already had sufficient rights, as well as the need for the Albanian language to be declared an official language in areas where few Albanians live. He also supported a military solution to the insurgency in Macedonia. From 2004 to 2005, he was a member of the international commission on the Balkans, headed by former Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato.

In response to Macedonian political and diaspora organisations&#x27; claims of direct descent to Alexander the Great, Gligorov stated several times that the ethnic Macedonians are unrelated to the ancient Macedonians, as well as that they are a South Slavic people. In an interview with the Toronto Star on 15 March 1992, he said: &quot;We are Macedonians but we are Slav Macedonians. That&#x27;s who we are! We have no connection to Alexander the Great and his Macedonia. The ancient Macedonians no longer exist, they had disappeared from history long time ago. Our ancestors came here in the 5th and 6th century (AD).&quot; Among his associates and international researchers, he earned the nickname &quot;the Fox&quot; due to his political acumen and diplomatic skill. International researchers also saw him as a moderate politician.

Kiro Gligorov was the oldest Macedonian political official. In November 1999, when his second presidential term ended, he was 82 years old. Gligorov died at the age of 94 on 1 January 2012 in Skopje, in his sleep. At his own request, the funeral was private with only his closest family in attendance. Some high-ranking officials and academics, such as then Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov and Chief of General Staff Gorančo Koteski, came to pay their respects beforehand. He was buried in Butel Municipality, Skopje.

Gligorov authored the following memoirs:
*&quot;Македонија е сè што имаме&quot; (&quot;Makedonija e se što imame&quot;; ; 2000)
*&quot;Атентат - ден потоа&quot; (&quot;Atentat - den potoa&quot;; ; 2002)

<doc id="339153" wikidata="Q846514" url="?curid=339153" title="Netley Abbey">
<text>Netley Abbey is a ruined late medieval monastery in the village of Netley near Southampton in Hampshire, England. The abbey was founded in 1239 as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order. Despite royal patronage, Netley was never rich, produced no influential scholars nor churchmen, and its nearly 300-year history was quiet. The monks were best known to their neighbours for the generous hospitality they offered to travellers on land and sea.

In 1536, Netley Abbey was seized by Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the buildings granted to William Paulet, a wealthy Tudor politician, who converted them into a mansion. The abbey was used as a country house until the beginning of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials. Subsequently the ruins became a tourist attraction, and provided inspiration to poets and artists of the Romantic movement. In the early twentieth century the site was given to the nation, and it is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, cared for by English Heritage. The extensive remains consist of the church, cloister buildings, abbot&#x27;s house, and fragments of the post-Dissolution mansion. Netley Abbey is one of the best preserved medieval Cistercian monasteries in southern England.

==Foundation==
Netley was conceived by the influential Peter des Roches, who was Bishop of Winchester from 1205 until his death in 1238; the abbey was founded shortly after his death, in 1239. The founder&#x27;s charter shows the name of the abbey as &quot;the church of St Mary of Edwardstow&quot;, or the Latin &quot;Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de loco Sancti Edwardi&quot; although the title of the charter calls it &quot;Letley&quot;; the present name of Netley is most likely derived from this. The abbey was one of a pair of monasteries which the bishop intended as a memorial to himself; the other is La Clarté-Dieu in Saint-Paterne-Racan, France. Des Roches began to purchase the lands for Netley&#x27;s initial endowment in about 1236, but he died before the project was finished and the foundation was completed by his executors. According to the Chronicle of Waverley Abbey, the first monks arrived to settle the site on 25 July 1239 from neighbouring Beaulieu Abbey, a year after the bishop&#x27;s death. The fact of its founder prior death before designation of the endowment was complete, put the incipient abbey in a difficult financial situation. It is thought that only after the house was taken under the wing of Henry III, who became interested in it in the mid-1240s, was progress made on the buildings. The King eventually assumed the role of patron in 1251.

==Buildings==
===Church===
The fruits of royal patronage were demonstrated by the construction of a large church ( long), built in the fashionable French-influenced Gothic style pioneered by Henry&#x27;s masons at Westminster Abbey. The high quality and elaborate nature of the church&#x27;s decoration, particularly its mouldings and tracery, indicate how the machine of royal patronage lead to a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur then considered appropriate to a secular church such as a cathedral. Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The sanctuary and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the nave was completed over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from Derbyshire in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage. The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed &quot;H. DI. GRA REX ANGE&quot; (Latin for &quot;Henry by the Grace of God King of the English&quot;) shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey&#x27;s patron. Taking many decades to complete, the church was probably finished between 1290 and 1320. Dating the various parts of the building relies predominantly on stylistic criteria.
The church was cruciform in shape, with vaulting and a square sanctuary and a low central tower containing bells. It was aisled throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each transept. There was no triforium, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a clerestory of triple lancet windows ran above each bay of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end of the sanctuary, probably built after 1260, had a large window which features an upper rose and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows were simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle had plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof. The north aisle windows by contrast had richly decorated cusped tracery, reflecting the changes in taste over the long period of construction, and suggesting that this was among the last parts of the church to be finished, probably in the very late thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The west wall of the church also has a large window, the tracery of which was destroyed in a collapse during the eighteenth century. Surviving fragments show that it was built in a &quot;freer and more advanced style&quot; than other parts of the church, and suggest a date around the turn of the fourteenth century.

Internally, the church was subdivided into several areas. The high altar was against the east wall of the sanctuary, flanked by two smaller altars on the side walls. To the west, under the tower, were the monks&#x27; choir stalls where they sat during services, and further west was a pulpitum or rood screen, which blocked access to the ritual areas of the church. In the nave, the lay brothers had their own choir stalls and altar for services. The monks of Netley kept up a schedule of services and prayer both day and night following the traditional canonical hours; a staircase in the south transept went up to the monks&#x27; dormitory, allowing them to convenient access to the night services. The lay brothers had their own entrance to the church at the west end via a covered gallery from their accommodation.

Unlike other orders of monks who allowed parishioners and visitors admission to the nave, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely for the use of the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate. Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at Hailes Abbey with its relic of the Holy Blood, and to allow the construction of tombs and chantries for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders. Excavated sculpture shows that the church at Netley featured a number of elaborate tombs and monuments.

The interior of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed to give the impression of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.

===Cloister and east range===
South of the church stands a cloister surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was the heart of the abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks&#x27; desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.

The east range, which was started at the same time as the church and probably took about 10 years to build, contained many of the abbey&#x27;s most important rooms. The vaulted library and sacristy were on the ground floor, adjacent to the church. To the south was the chapter house, where the deliberations of the abbey took place and the monks met to transact business and to listen to a daily reading of a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict. At Netley this was a magnificent apartment divided into three aisles with vaults springing from four columns; a stone bench ran around the walls for the monks to sit on, and the abbot&#x27;s throne was in the centre of the east wall. The entrance to the chapter house from the cloister is via an elaborately moulded arched doorway, flanked on each side by a window of similar size. The windows had sills and columns of Purbeck Marble, the whole forming an impressive composition appropriate to the second most important space in the abbey after the church. The windows on either side of the door would have been unglazed, so as to allow representatives of the laybrothers (who were not members of chapter) to listen to debates. The chapter house was also the site of some tombs, traditionally those of the abbots of a monastery. When the room was excavated, archaeologists discovered scattered human remains and evidence of graves beneath the medieval floor level, indicating that a number of burials.

The parlour lies south, an austere, barrel vaulted room little more than a passageway through the building. Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on. South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the lifetime of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks&#x27; day room and accommodation for novices, but as time went on it may have been converted into the misericord where the monks—initially only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole convent—could eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall. 

The monks&#x27; dormitory was on the top floor of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks&#x27; beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, presumably located for security at night.

===Reredorter and infirmary===

Another large building lies crosswise at the south end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth-century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.

The upper floor of this building was the reredorter or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks&#x27; dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the effluent dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building.

To the west of the reredorter block was the buttery, a room where the monks&#x27; wine (some of it direct from the king&#x27;s cellars at Southampton) and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have revealed fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary.

===South range===
During the Tudor conversion of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat to rise to the refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey&#x27;s charters, records and title deeds, as well as those of local lords, were kept.

The refectory projected south from the centre of the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries. This is now almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated. It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks&#x27; refectory and to the separate dining hall for the lay brothers on the west side.

===West range===

The west range at Netley is small and does not run the full length of the west side of the cloister. It is divided in two by the original main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers&#x27; refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted the lay brothers&#x27; quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as Sawley Abbey in Lancashire, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period.

All the buildings around the cloister were finished in the fourteenth century. There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period aside from the re-vaulting of the south transept of the church at the end of the fifteenth century. It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later Middle Ages (as seen at Cleeve Abbey in Somerset) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.

===Precinct===

A stone building to the east of the main complex is thought to have been the abbot&#x27;s house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.

The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a precinct containing an outer (public) courtyard and an inner (private) courtyard, gardens, barns, guesthouses for travellers, stables, fishponds, the home farm and industrial buildings. The site was defended by a high bank and moat, part of which remains east of the abbey. Entrance was strictly controlled by an outer and inner gatehouse. A chapel, known as the (Latin for &quot;chapel outside the gates&quot;) was placed by the outer gatehouse for the use of travellers and the local population. Of the precinct buildings, only the abbot&#x27;s house, the moat and the fishponds have left visible remains.

Netley&#x27;s fresh water was supplied by two aqueducts which ran for several miles east and west of the abbey, up into the areas of modern Southampton and Eastleigh. The remains of the eastern aqueduct, now known as Tickleford Gully, can be seen in Wentworth Gardens, Southampton.

==Monastic history==
Henry III added to the endowment left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king&#x27;s sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey&#x27;s income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.

Nevertheless, Netley remained a much respected institution by its neighbours until the end of its life as a monastery. It was not known for scholarship, wealth, or particular fervour, but it was highly regarded for its generosity to travellers and sailors, and for the devout lives (&quot;by Raporte of good Religious conversation&quot;) led by its monks. The abbot was summoned on many occasions to sit in Parliament with fellow prelates in the House of Lords as one of the Lords Spiritual. Surviving reports suggest the abbey had a peaceful and scandal-free domestic life.

==A surviving book==
It is not a unique case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must have been a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of individual monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.

Current scholarship has identified a single book as having belonged to Netley Abbey; it is now conserved as British Library Arundel MS 69. The volume has an inscription, added in the 15th century on folio 265v: &quot;Codex iste pertinet ad domum sancte Marie de Netteley&quot; (&quot;This codex (i.e. a book not a scroll) belongs to the house of Saint Mary of Netteley&quot;). The volume itself is a Latin manuscript executed in the 13th century, a copy of Roger of Hoveden&#x27;s &quot;Chronica&quot; (&quot;Chronicles&quot;). Roger (died c. 1201) was an English historian of the reigns of Henry II and Richard I particularly important for his account of the years 1148–1170. Little is known in detail about his life, but he may have been a priest and was a courtier to Henry II, and accompanied Richard I to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade and served as a local justice in the north of England, and more generally as a negotiator between the crown and various barons and monastic houses.

==Dissolution==
In 1535 the abbey&#x27;s income was assessed in the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus,&quot; Henry VIII&#x27;s general survey of Church finances prior to the plunder, at £160 gross, £100 net, which meant the following year that it came under the terms of the First Suppression Act, Henry&#x27;s initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the beginning of the following year, the King&#x27;s commissioners, Sir James Worsley, John Paulet, George Paulet and William Berners, delivered a report to the government on the monasteries of Hampshire which provides a snapshot of Netley on the eve of the Dissolution. The commissioners noted that Netley was inhabited by seven monks, all of them priests, and the abbey was:
 
In addition to the monks, Netley was home to 29 servants and officials of the abbey, plus two Franciscan friars of the strict Observant part of that order who had been put into the abbot&#x27;s custody by the King, presumably for opposing his religious policies. The royal officers also found plate and jewels (these were certainly objects for worship, such as reliquaries or crosses) in the treasury worth £43, &quot;ornaments&quot; worth £39, and agricultural produce and animals worth £103. The abbey&#x27;s debts were moderate at £42.

Abbot Thomas Stevens and his seven monks were forced to surrender their house to the King in the summer of 1536. Abbot Stevens and six of his brethren—the seventh opted to resign and become a secular priest—crossed Southampton Water to join their mother house of Beaulieu. Abbot Stevens was appointed Abbot of Beaulieu in 1536 and administered it for two years until Beaulieu in turn was forced to surrender to the King in April 1538. The monks received pensions after the fall of Beaulieu; Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, and died in 1550.

==Country house==

Following the dissolution of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings and some of its estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable for one of the most important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks&#x27; dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.

His eventual successor William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester (c.1560–1629) of Basing House, Hampshire, on encountering financial difficulties, sold Basing and Hound in 1602 to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539–1621), of Tottenham House in Wiltshire, who used it as a residence, and died there in 1621. His eventual descendant William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652–1671) died aged 19 without progeny when his title passed by law to his heir male but his unentailed estates including Netley and Hound, passed top his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1656–1741), who sold Netley in 1676 to Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester (1629–1700), later Duke of Beaufort.

Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, inhabited the abbey until the close of the seventeenth century.

==Romantic ruin==

Around 1700, Netley Abbey came into the hands of Sir Berkeley Lucy (also spelled Sir &quot;Bartlet&quot;), who decided in 1704 to demolish the by now unfashionable house in order to sell the materials. Sir Berkeley made an agreement with a Southampton builder, Mr Walter Taylor, to take down the former church. However, during the course of the demolition, the contractor was killed by the fall of tracery from the west window of the church and the scheme was halted.
The abbey was subsequently abandoned and allowed to decay. In the 1760s Thomas Dummer, who owned estates in the area, moved the north transept to his estate at Cranbury Park near Winchester where it can be still be seen as a folly in the gardens of the house (at ).

By the second half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then partially roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey&#x27;s post-Dissolution story.

In 1922, the abbey was passed into state care by the then owner, Tankerville Chamberlayne, one time Member of Parliament (MP) for Southampton. Conservation and archaeological work on the abbey has continued.

==In literature and art==
Soon after the abbey had been allowed to fall into ruin, it began to attract the attention of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian Horace Walpole praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet Thomas Gray, claiming they were &quot;In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise&quot;. In 1764, George Keate wrote &quot;The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem&quot;, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains. 
Keate was followed by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (&quot;Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight&quot;, 1790). Sotheby&#x27;s view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled &quot;Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story&quot; in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham&#x27;s &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot; (1837–1845) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and ensuring God&#x27;s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.

&quot;Netley Abbey, an Operatic Farce&quot;, by William Pearce, was first performed in 1794 at Covent Garden. The set of the first production featured an elaborate mockup of the abbey ruins seen in the moonlight.

The earliest surviving depiction of the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows the church of the abbey much as it is today, with the exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.

==Present day==
===Condition===
The visitor today will find the shell of the church and monastic buildings around the cloister plus the abbot&#x27;s house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot&#x27;s house still have their vaults intact. Medieval heraldic polychrome tiles found on the site can be seen in the sacristy, and Henry III&#x27;s foundation stone remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of Netley and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an Ancient Monument protected by law.

===Events===
During the summer months the abbey is occasionally host to events such as open-air theatre and was the site of a flashmob wedding on 25 June 2011.

===2018 closure===
Netley Abbey was closed to the public in June 2018 due to safety concerns. English Heritage has taken the decision after scaffolding set up in the nave for conservation work was found to &quot;fall far short&quot; of expected standards.

==Local legends==
===Walter Taylor===
Over the years several legends have grown up around the abbey, the best attested of which is that of Walter Taylor, the builder contracted to demolish the church. Legend has it that before starting the work he was warned in a dream that he would be punished if he committed sacrilege by damaging the building. The story is recounted by the eighteenth-century antiquary Browne Walters:

===Blind Peter===
Another local legend states that during the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey&#x27;s treasure was hidden down a secret tunnel with a lone monk to guard it. After many years of searching a treasure hunter called Slown is said to have entered an underground passage he had discovered only to return a few moments later screaming, &quot;In the name of God, block it up,&quot; before dropping dead.

===The walled up nun===
The story of the nun walled up in a small room recounted in Richard Barham&#x27;s &quot;The Ingoldsby Legends&quot; was a creation of the author and has no basis in fact or genuine folklore, as the author himself admits with a smile in his notes to the poem, attributing his story to one James Harrison:
