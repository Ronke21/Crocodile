<text>Amos Oz (; born Amos Klausner (); 4 May 1939 – 28 December 2018) was an Israeli writer, novelist, journalist, and intellectual. He was also a professor of Hebrew literature at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. From 1967 onwards, Oz was a prominent advocate of a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

He was the author of 40 books, including novels, short story collections, children&#x27;s books, and essays, and his work has been published in 45 languages, more than that of any other Israeli writer. He was the recipient of many honours and awards, among them the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels, the Legion of Honour of France, the Israel Prize, the Goethe Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature, the Heinrich Heine Prize, and the Franz Kafka Prize.

Oz is regarded as one of &quot;Israel&#x27;s most prolific writers and respected intellectuals&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; worded it in an obituary.

== Biography ==
Amos Klausner (later Oz) was born in 1939 in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, where he grew up at No. 18 Amos Street in the Kerem Avraham neighborhood. He was the only child of Fania (Mussman) and Yehuda Arieh Klausner, immigrants to Mandatory Palestine who had met while studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His father&#x27;s family was from Lithuania, where they had been farmers, raising cattle and vegetables near Vilnius. His father studied history and literature in Vilnius (then part of Poland), and hoped to become a professor of comparative literature, but never gained headway in the academic world. He worked most of his life as a librarian at the Jewish National and University Library. Oz&#x27;s mother grew up in Rivne (then part of Poland, now Ukraine). She was a highly sensitive and cultured daughter of a wealthy mill owner and his wife, and attended Charles University in Prague, where she studied history and philosophy. She had to abandon her studies when her father&#x27;s business collapsed during the Great Depression.

Oz&#x27;s parents were multilingual (his father claimed he could read in 16 or 17 languages, while his mother spoke four or five languages, but could read in seven or eight) but neither was comfortable speaking in Hebrew, which was adopted as the official language of Israel. They spoke with each other in Russian or Polish, but the only language they allowed Oz to learn was Hebrew.

Many of Oz&#x27;s family members were right-wing Revisionist Zionists. His great-uncle Joseph Klausner was the Herut party candidate for the presidency against Chaim Weizmann and was chair of the Hebrew literature department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Klausner had a large personal library in his home and hosted salons for Israeli intellectuals; the lifestyle and scholarship of Klausner left an impression on Oz as a young boy.

Oz described himself as an &quot;atheist of the book&quot;, stating from a secular perspective that his Jewish heritage &quot;contains first and foremost books [and] texts&quot;. His parents were not religious growing up, though Oz attended the community religious school, Tachkemoni, since the only alternative was a socialist school affiliated with the Labor movement, to which his family was even more opposed. The noted poet Zelda Schneersohn Mishkovsky was one of his teachers. After Tachkemoni, he attended Gymnasia Rehavia.

During the Holocaust, some of his family members were killed in Lithuania.

His mother, who suffered from depression, committed suicide in January 1952, when he was 12. Oz would later explore the repercussions of this event in his memoir &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot;.

At the age of 14, Oz became a Labor Zionist, left home, and joined Kibbutz Hulda. There he was adopted by the Huldai family and changed his surname to &quot;Oz&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;courage&quot;). Later asked why he did not leave Jerusalem for Tel Aviv, he replied: &quot;Tel Aviv was not radical enough – only the kibbutz was radical enough&quot;. By his own account, he was &quot;a disaster as a laborer...the joke of the kibbutz&quot;. When Oz first began to write, the kibbutz allotted him one day per week for this work. When his novel &quot;My Michael&quot; became a best-seller, Oz quipped: &quot;I became a branch of the farm, yet they still said I could have just three days a week to write. It was only in the eighties when I got four days for my writing, two days for teaching, and Saturday turns as a waiter in the dining hall.&quot;

Oz did his Israel Defense Forces service in the Nahal Brigade, participating in border skirmishes with Syria. After concluding his three years of mandatory regular army service, he was sent by his kibbutz to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he studied philosophy and Hebrew literature. He graduated in 1963 and began teaching in the kibbutz high school, while continuing to write. He served as an army reservist in a tank unit that fought in the Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War, and in the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War.

Oz married Nily Zuckerman in 1960, and they had three children. The family continued to live at Hulda until 1986, when they moved to Arad in the Negev to seek relief for their son asthma. Oz was a full professor of Hebrew literature at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from 1987 to 2014. He also served as a writer in residence and visiting scholar at universities abroad. In 2014, the family moved to Tel Aviv. His oldest daughter, Fania Oz-Salzberger, teaches history at the University of Haifa.

Oz died of cancer on 28 December 2018 in Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, aged 79. He was buried at Kibbutz Hulda.

In February 2021, Oz&#x27;s daughter accused her late father of subjecting her to &quot;sadistic abuse&quot;. In her autobiography, Galia alleged that Amos Oz beat, swore at, and humiliated her in a routine of emotional, verbal, and physical abuse, writing that &quot;The violence was creative: He dragged me from inside the house and threw me outside. He called me trash.&quot; Members of Galia&#x27;s family have denied the allegations, claiming: &quot;We have known all our lives a very different Amos, a warm and affectionate man who loved his family deeply and gently.&quot; In 2022, Oz&#x27;s son Daniel published a memoir staunchly defending his father and criticizing his sister for supposedly distorting the truth.

==Literary career==
Oz published his first book, &quot;Where the Jackals Howl&quot;, a collection of short stories, in 1965. His first novel, &quot;Another Place&quot; (published in U.S. as &quot;Elsewhere, Perhaps&quot;) appeared in 1966. Subsequently, Oz averaged a book per year with the Histadrut press Am Oved. In 1988, Oz left Am Oved for the , which offered him an exclusive contract that granted him a fixed monthly salary regardless of output. Oz became a primary figure in the Israeli &quot;New Wave&quot; movement in literature in the 1960s, a group which included A. B. Yehoshua, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, and Aharon Appelfeld.

Oz published 40 books, among them 14 novels, five collections of stories and novellas, two children&#x27;s books, and twelve books of articles and essays (as well as eight selections of essays that appeared in various languages), and about 450 articles and essays. His works have been translated into some 45 languages, more than any other Israeli writer. In 2007, a selection from the Chinese translation of &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; was the first work of modern Hebrew literature to appear in an official Chinese textbook. The story &quot;Esperanto&quot; from the collection &quot;Between Friends&quot; was translated into Esperanto in 2015.

Oz&#x27;s political commentary and literary criticism have been published in the Histadrut newspaper &quot;Davar&quot; and &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;. Translations of his essays have appeared in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. The Ben-Gurion University of the Negev maintains an archive of his work.

Oz tended to present protagonists in a realistic light with an ironic touch while his treatment of the life in the kibbutz was accompanied by a somewhat critical tone. Oz credited a 1959 translation of American writer Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; with his decision to &quot;write about what was around me&quot;. In &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot;, his memoir of coming of age in the midst of Israel&#x27;s violent birth pangs, Oz credited Anderson&#x27;s &quot;modest book&quot; with his own realization that &quot;the written world ... always revolves around the hand that is writing, wherever it happens to be writing: where you are is the center of the universe.&quot; In his 2004 essay &quot;How to Cure a Fanatic&quot; (later the title essay of a 2006 collection), Oz argues that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a war of religion or cultures or traditions, but rather a real estate dispute – one that will be resolved not by greater understanding, but by painful compromise.

== Views and opinions ==

Oz was one of the first Israelis to advocate a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict after the Six-Day War. He did so in a 1967 article &quot;Land of our Forefathers&quot; in the Labor newspaper &quot;Davar&quot;. &quot;Even unavoidable occupation is a corrupting occupation,&quot; he wrote. In 1978, he was one of the founders of Peace Now. He did not oppose (and in 1991 advocated) the construction of an Israeli West Bank barrier, but believed that it should be roughly along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice line between Israel and Jordan. He also advocated that Jerusalem be divided into numerous zones, not just Jewish and Palestinian zones, including one for the Eastern Orthodox, one for Hasidic Jews, an international zone, and so on.

He was opposed to Israeli settlement activity and was among the first to praise the Oslo Accords and talks with the PLO. In his speeches and essays he frequently attacked the non-Zionist left and always emphasized his Zionist identity. He was perceived as an eloquent spokesperson of the Zionist left. When Shimon Peres retired from the leadership of the Israeli Labor Party, he is said to have named Oz as one of three possible successors, along with Ehud Barak (later Prime Minister) and Shlomo Ben-Ami (later Barak&#x27;s foreign minister). In the 1990s, Oz withdrew his support from Labor and went further left to the Meretz Party, where he had close connections with the leader, Shulamit Aloni. In the elections to the sixteenth Knesset that took place in 2003, Oz appeared in the Meretz television campaign, calling upon the public to vote for Meretz.

Oz was a supporter of the Second Lebanon War in 2006. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Many times in the past, the Israeli peace movement has criticized Israeli military operations. Not this time. This time, the battle is not over Israeli expansion and colonization. There is no Lebanese territory occupied by Israel. There are no territorial claims from either side... The Israeli peace movement should support Israel&#x27;s attempt at self-defense, pure and simple, as long as this operation targets mostly Hezbollah and spares, as much as possible, the lives of Lebanese civilians.&quot; Later, Oz changed his position of unequivocal support of the war as &quot;self-defense&quot; in the wake of the cabinet&#x27;s decision to expand operations in Lebanon.

A day before the outbreak of the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Oz signed a statement supporting military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Two weeks later, he advocated a ceasefire with Hamas and called attention to the harsh conditions there. He was quoted in the Italian paper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; as saying Hamas was responsible for the outbreak of violence, but the time had come to seek a ceasefire. Oz also said that if innocent citizens were indeed killed in Gaza, it should be treated as a war crime, although he doubted that bombing UN structures was intentional.

In a June 2010 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Hamas is not just a terrorist organization. Hamas is an idea, a desperate and fanatical idea that grew out of the desolation and frustration of many Palestinians. No idea has ever been defeated by force... To defeat an idea, you have to offer a better idea, a more attractive and acceptable one... Israel has to sign a peace agreement with President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah government in the West Bank.&quot;

In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti a copy of his book &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; in Arabic translation with his personal dedication in Hebrew: &quot;This story is our story, I hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz.&quot; The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz&#x27;s invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.

Oz supported Israeli actions in Gaza during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, criticizing the tactic of using human shields, widely imputed to be employed by Hamas at the time, asking: &quot;What would you do if your neighbor across the street sits down on the balcony, puts his little boy on his lap, and starts shooting machine-gun fire into your nursery? What would you do if your neighbor across the street digs a tunnel from his nursery to your nursery in order to blow up your home or in order to kidnap your family?&quot;

<text>The Nanai people () are a Tungusic people of East Asia who have traditionally lived along Heilongjiang (Amur), Songhuajiang (Sunggari) and Wusuli River (Ussuri) on the Middle Amur Basin. The ancestors of the Nanai were the Wild Jurchens of northernmost Manchuria, which is now the region of Outer Manchuria in Russia&#x27;s Far Eastern Federal District.

The Nanai language belongs to the Manchu-Tungusic family. According to the 2010 census there were 12,003 Nanai in Russia.

==Name==

Common names for these people include Nanai (Nanai: , , , ) and Hezhen (, ; ). There are also terms formerly in use: Goldi, Golds, Goldes, and Samagir.

Other self names are Qilang (, ; ), and . means &#x27;land, earth, ground, country&#x27; or, in this context, &#x27;native, local&#x27;; , , or means &#x27;people&#x27; in different dialects.

The Russian linguist L. I. Sem gives the name &quot;Hezhe nai&quot; () or &quot;Hezheni&quot; (, ) and explains it as the self-name of the Nanai of the lower Amur, meaning &#x27;people who live along the lower course of the river&#x27;. It is the source of the Chinese name for the Nanai, (), formerly () and ().

==Traditional lifestyle and culture==

Some of the earliest first-hand accounts of the Nanai people in the European languages belong to the French Jesuit geographers travelling on the Ussuri and the Amur in 1709. According to them, the native people living on the Ussuri and on the Amur above the mouth of the Dondon River (which falls into the Amur between today&#x27;s Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur) were known as Yupi Tartars, while the name of the people living on the Dondon and on the Amur below Dondon was transcribed by the Jesuits into French as &quot;Ketching&quot;.
The latter name may be the French transcription of the reported self-name of the Nanai of the lower Amur, , which was also applied to the closely related Ulch people.

According to the Jesuits, the language of the Yupi people seemed to occupy an intermediate position between the Manchu language and that of the &quot;Ketching&quot; people (); some level of communication between the Yupi and the Ketching was possible.

Some Han Chinese are said to have founded clan subdivisions among the Nanai, and the Nanai have absorbed Manchu and Jurchens. Nanai culture is influenced by Han Chinese and Manchu culture, and the Nanai share a myth in common with southern Chinese.

The Nanais at first fought against the Nurhaci and the Manchus, led by their own Nanai Hurka chief Sosoku before surrendering to Hongtaiji in 1631. Mandatory shaving of the front of all male heads was imposed on Amur peoples conquered by the Qing including the Nanai people. The Amur peoples already wore the queue on the back of their heads but did not shave the front until the Qing subjected them and ordered them to shave. The term &quot;shaved-head people&quot; was used to describe the Nanai by Ulch people.

===Economy===

As described by early visitors (e.g., Jesuit cartographers on the Ussuri River in 1709), the economy of the people living there (who would be classified as Nanai, or possible Udege people, today) was based on fishing. The people lived in villages along the banks of the Ussuri, and spent their entire summers fishing, eating fresh fish in the summer (particularly appreciating the sturgeon), and drying more fish for eating in winter. Fish was used as fodder for those few domestic animals they had (which made the flesh of a locally raised pig almost inedible by visitors with European tastes).
The traditional clothing was made out of fish skins. These skins were left to dry, struck repeatedly with a mallet to leave them completely smooth, and sewn together. The fish chosen to be used were those weighing more than 50 kilograms.
In the past centuries, this distinct practice earned the Nanai the name &quot;Fish-skin Tartars&quot; (). This name has also been applied, more generically, to other aboriginal groups of the lower Sungari and lower Amur basins.

Agriculture entered the Nanai lands only slowly. Practically the only crop grown by the &quot;Yupi&quot; villagers on the Ussuri River shores in 1709 was some tobacco.

===Religion===
The Nanai are mainly Shamanist, with a great reverence for the bear (&quot;Doonta&quot;) and the tiger (&quot;Amba&quot;). They consider that the shamans have the power to expel bad spirits by means of prayers to the gods. During the centuries they have been worshippers of the spirits of the sun, the moon, the mountains, the water and the trees. According to their beliefs, the land was once flat until great serpents gouged out the river valleys. They consider that all the things of the universe possess their own spirit and that these spirits wander independently throughout the world. In the Nanai religion, inanimate objects were often personified. Fire, for example, was personified as an elderly woman whom the Nanai referred to as Fadzya Mama. Young children were not allowed to run up to the fire, since they might startle Fadzya Mama, and men always were courteous in the presence of a fire.

Nanai shamans, like other Tungusic peoples of the region, had characteristic clothing, consisting of a skirt and jacket; a leather belt with conical metal pendants; mittens with figures of serpents, lizards or frogs; and hats with branching horns or bear, wolf, or fox fur attached to it. Bits of Chinese mirrors were also sometimes incorporated into the costume.

==== Funerary beliefs and practices ====
When a person dies their soul lives on, as the body is merely an outer shell for the soul. This concept of a continuing soul was not introduced to the Nanai by Christianity, but is original to them.

The Nanai believe that each person has both a soul and a spirit. On death, the soul and spirit will go different ways. A person’s spirit becomes malevolent and begins to harm their living relatives. With time, these &quot;amban&quot; may be tamed and can later be worshipped; otherwise, a special ritual must be performed to chase the evil spirit away.

After death, a person&#x27;s soul is put into a temporary shelter made of cloth, called a &quot;lachako.&quot; The souls of the deceased will remain in the &quot;lachako&quot; for seven days before being moved to a wooden sort of doll called a &quot;panyo&quot;, where it will remain until the final funerary ritual.

The &quot;panyo&quot; is taken care of as if it is a living person; for example, it is given a bed to sleep in each night, with a pillow and blanket to match its miniature size. The closest family member is in charge of taking care of the deceased’s &quot;panyo&quot;. Each night this family member puts the &quot;panyo&quot; to bed and then wakes it in the morning. The &quot;panyo&quot; has a small hole carved where the mouth of a person would be, so that a pipe may occasionally be placed there and allow the deceased to smoke. If the family member travels they will bring the &quot;panyo&quot; with them.

The dead’s final funerary ritual is called &quot;kasa tavori&quot; and lasts three days, during which there is much feasting and the souls of the deceased are prepared for their journey to the underworld. The most important part of the &quot;kasa tavori&quot; is held on the third day. On this day, the dead’s souls are moved from the &quot;panyo&quot; into large human-looking wooden figures made to be about the size of the deceased, called &quot;mugdeh.&quot; These &quot;mugdeh&quot; are moved into a dog sled that will be used to transport them to the underworld, &quot;Buni&quot;. Before leaving for &quot;Buni&quot;, the shaman communicates any last wills of the deceased to the gathered family. For example, in the anthropologist Gaer’s account of this ritual, one soul asked his family to repay a debt to a neighbor that the deceased was never able to repay.

After this ceremony, the shaman leads the dog sleds on the dangerous journey to &quot;Buni&quot;, from where she must leave before sunset or else she will die.

After &quot;kasa tavori&quot;, it has previously been practiced that the living relatives could no longer visit the graves of the deceased, or even talk about them.

The souls of Nanai infants do not behave in the same manner as an adult’s. For the Nanai, children under a year old are not yet people, but are birds. When an infant dies, its soul will turn into a bird and fly off. When an infant dies they are not buried. Instead they are wrapped in a paper made of birch bark and placed in a large tree somewhere in the forest. The soul of the child, or the bird, is then free to enter back into a woman. It is common practice in preparing a funeral rite of an infant to mark it with coal, such as drawing a bracelet around the wrist. If a child is later born to a woman that has similar markings to those drawn on a deceased child then it is believed to be the same soul reborn.

The deceased were normally buried in the ground with the exception of children who died prior to the first birthday; these are buried in tree branches as a &quot;wind burial&quot;. Many Nanai are also Tibetan Buddhist.

==Modern population==
===Russia===

In Russia the Nanai live on the Sea of Okhotsk, on the Amur River, downstream from Khabarovsk, on both sides of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, as well as on the banks of the Ussuri and the Girin rivers (the Samagirs). The Russians formerly called them Goldi, after a Nanai clan name. According to the 2002 census, there were 12,160 Nanai in Russia.

In the Soviet Union, a written standard of the Nanai language (based on Cyrillic) was created by Valentin Avrorin and others. It is still taught today in 13 schools in Khabarovsk.

===China===
The Nanai are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China where they are known as &quot;Hezhe&quot; (). According to the last census of 2004, they numbered 4,640 in China (mostly in Heilongjiang province). Chinese Nanai speak the Hezhen dialect of Nanai. They also have a rich oral literature known as the Yimakan. The dialect does not have a written system in China and Nanai usually write in Chinese. (Second language literacy is 84%.) However, as of 2005 teachers have recently finished compiling what is probably the first Hezhe language textbook.

<doc id="330859" wikidata="Q723867" url="?curid=330859" title="Shinichirō Watanabe">
<text>is a Japanese anime television and film director, best known for directing the critically acclaimed and commercially successful anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Samurai Champloo, Carole &amp; Tuesday&quot;, and &quot;Space Dandy&quot;. Considered an auteur of Japanese animation by film and television critics, Watanabe&#x27;s work is characterized by evocative uses of music, mature themes, and the incorporation of multiple genres.

== Career ==
Watanabe was born in Kyoto. After joining the Japanese animation studio Sunrise, he supervised the episode direction and storyboards of numerous Sunrise anime, and soon made his directorial debut as co-director of the well-received &quot;Macross&quot; update, &quot;Macross Plus&quot;. His next effort, and first full directorial venture, was the 1998 series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, which received universal praise and is considered by many to be one of the greatest anime series of all time. It was followed by the 2001 film &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. In 2003, Watanabe directed his first American-produced anime, the short films &quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;A Detective Story&quot;, both part of The Wachowskis&#x27; &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, an anthology of animated short stories from &quot;The Matrix&quot;. His next directorial effort was the critically acclaimed 2004 anime series &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; which began broadcasting on Fuji Television in Japan on May 19, 2004.

Following the release of &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, Watanabe directed a short film called &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, which was released on July 7, 2007 as a segment of the anthology film &quot;Genius Party&quot;. In recent years, he has been active as a creative music producer, overseeing the 2004 film &quot;Mind Game&quot;, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Michiko &amp; Hatchin&quot;, and supervising the storyboards for episode 12 of &quot;Tetsuwan Birdy: Decode&quot;. In 2012, he directed the anime series &quot;Kids on the Slope&quot; (Japanese title: &quot;Sakamichi no Apollon&quot;), a coming-of-age story about young jazz musicians, which premiered in April 2012 on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina block.

In 2009, it was announced that Watanabe would be working as an associate producer on the upcoming live-action adaptation of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, alongside his fellow Sunrise staff members Kenji Uchida and Keiko Nobumoto. During FicZone in Granada, Spain, it was reported that Watanabe was collaborating with anime studio BONES on a space science-fiction comedy. BONES subsequently confirmed that the studio was working with Watanabe, but did not confirm the genre of the series. In late 2013, the original trailers for &quot;Space Dandy&quot; were released to the public. The dubbed version premiered on Adult Swim on its Toonami block on January 4, 2014 in the United States, hours before airing in Japan. He is frequently ranked among Japan&#x27;s best animation directors.

Watanabe directed the anime short film &quot;Blade Runner Black Out 2022&quot;, which was released in 2017. On November 29, 2018, it was announced that he would be creative producer of &quot;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&quot;, an anime series produced for Adult Swim and Crunchyroll.

He received an associate producer credit on the Netflix adaptation of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; but was not involved in its production and criticized it after its release.

=== Music videos ===
*&quot;More&quot; (featuring Anderson .Paak) – Flying Lotus (2019; director)

== Use of music ==
Watanabe has a distinct vision regarding the importance of the film score of his works and believes that music is the universal language. &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; is heavily influenced by American culture, especially the jazz movements of the 1940s, hence the title &quot;bebop&quot;. This style is blended with a score by the prolific composer Yoko Kanno featuring jazz, blues and funk music. The anachronistic soundtrack of &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, though an Edo period piece, draws heavily from hip hop music, while the later series &quot;Kids on the Slope&quot; demonstrates many classical forms of jazz, and &quot;Space Dandy&quot; draws from primarily new wave music. His series &quot;Terror in Resonance&quot; utilizes post-rock and ambient music influenced by Icelandic band Sigur Rós. His series &quot;Carole and Tuesday&quot; is based entirely off of the bonds made by music.

== Trivia ==

* Shinichiro Watanabe confirmed in a 2019 interview that &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Carole &amp; Tuesday&quot;, and &quot;Space Dandy&quot; all exist within the same universe, and in that chronological order.

<text>The Bay of Plenty region, officially the Bay of Plenty Region, is a local government region in the North Island of New Zealand. Also called just the Bay of Plenty (BOP), it is situated around the marine bight of that same name. The bay was named by James Cook after he noticed the abundant food supplies at several Māori villages there, in stark contrast to what he observed in Poverty Bay.

The Bay of Plenty had an estimated resident population of 354,100 in and is the fifth-most populous region in New Zealand. It also has the third-highest regional population density in New Zealand, with only the 11th-largest land area. The major population centres are Tauranga, Rotorua and Whakatāne. The Bay of Plenty is one of the fastest growing regions in New Zealand: the regional population increased by 7.5% between 2001 and 2006, with significant growth in the coastal and western parts, and grew by 8.3% between 2018 and 2023. It has the second-largest Māori population in New Zealand, with over 30% of its population being of Māori descent, and the second-highest number of Māori speakers in the country. It also has the largest number of iwi of any region. There are 35 local iwi, 260 hapū and 224 marae, with the most significant iwi being Te Arawa, Ngāi Tūhoe, Ngāti Awa and Te Whakatōhea.

Significant horticultural, forestry and tourism industries are well established in the region. However, the Bay of Plenty is the third-most economically deprived region in New Zealand, with the eastern districts being among the least economically developed in the country.

== History ==

The Bay of Plenty region as a local government area was formed in the nationwide 1989 local government reforms. The new region incorporated the former counties of Tauranga, Rotorua, Whakātane and Ōpōtiki.

== Governance ==
Bay of Plenty Regional Council oversees regional land use, environmental management and civil defence.

The region wholly includes the territorial authority areas of Western Bay of Plenty District, Tauranga City, Whakatāne District, Kawerau District, and Ōpōtiki District, and parts of Rotorua Lakes District and the town of Rangitaiki in Taupō District.

Public health in New Zealand is broken into regions. The Bay of Plenty and Lakes district health boards have public health provided by Toi Te Ora – Public Health.

== Geography ==

The Bay of Plenty region covers of land and of coastal marine area. It extends along the eastern coast of the North Island, from the base of the Coromandel Peninsula in the west to Cape Runaway in the east. The region extends 12 nautical miles from the mainland coastline, and also extends from the coastlines of several islands in the bay, notably Mayor Island/Tuhua, Mōtītī Island, Whale Island and the active volcano of Whakaari/White Island. It extends inland to the sparsely populated forest lands around Rotorua and Murupara.

The region has more than of lakes, known as the Lakes of Rotorua.
Much of the central part of the region lies within the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which extends from the centre of the North Island northwards to Whakaari/White Island. Volcanic mountains and lakes, geothermal areas and geological fault lines all dot the landscape. The geothermal region around Rotorua is a major tourist site, while many hot springs in the region are used as swimming areas. The geothermal field near Kawerau is the site of a geothermal power plant that will reportedly meet up to one third of residential and industrial electricity demand in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. Whakaari/White Island, the site of a former sulfur-mining operation, is an active volcanic island popular with tourists. The eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886 and the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake were two disasters related to geological activity in the volcanic plateau.

Prominent volcanic cones in the region include Mount Maunganui, Mount Tarawera and Mount Edgecumbe/Putauaki. These features also have cultural significance to local Māori. The Kaimai and Mamaku mountain ranges lie at the western border of the region. Swamp land was formerly concentrated around a number of rivers, but much of this was dredged in the early part of the 20th century to increase land for settlement and other uses. Large native and foreign (planted) forest areas are found in the inland parts of the region. The Kaingaroa Forest is the world&#x27;s largest planted forest, comprising radiata pine mainly used for timber.

=== Climate ===
The Bay of Plenty region has warm, humid summers and mild winters. It is one of the warmest regions in New Zealand, particularly along the coastline, and most areas experience at least 2,200 hours of sunshine per annum. Average daily maximum temperatures range from in winter and in summer. Typical minima vary from in winter and during summer. Rainfall occurs more frequently in winter than in summer, but tropical storms in summer and autumn can produce heavy rain with high winds. Central parts of the region can receive up to of rainfall annually, while the eastern and western areas can receive up to .

== Economy ==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Bay of Plenty was estimated at NZ$17.24 billion in the year to March 2019, 5.7% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $53,700 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $1.89 billion (11.6%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $3.24 billion (20.0%), service industries contributed $9.72 billion (59.8%), and taxes and duties contributed $1.39 billion (8.6%).
Agriculture, natural resources and tourism are the major industries. Most (96 per cent) of the region is defined as &#x27;rural&#x27;, with 22% of land usage representing farm land and 38% representing nature reserve land. The most common agricultural land uses are horticulture, dairy, grazing and sheep farming. The region has over 11,500 hectares of horticultural land, predominantly producing kiwifruit and avocadoes. The region also has an abundance of coastal, forestry and geothermal resources. Forestry emerged as a vital industry in the 1950s, with radiata pine being planted during the early 20th century. Forestry is commercially planted and managed, mostly using planted foreign tree species, and timber is sent to the Port of Tauranga for export. Geothermal activity is a source of tourism, and geothermal energy is emerging as a major regional source of electricity. Tourism is the other notable industry, accounting for 15% of the region&#x27;s GDP from March 2000 to 2004.

Overall economic growth in the Bay of Plenty averaged 2.1% between March 2000 and 2004, compared with the national rate of 3.5%, although per capita real GDP growth in the five years to March 2003 matched the national growth rate at an averaged 2.3%. In the 2013 Census, the median annual income was $26,200, below the national median of $28,500. Further, 39.3% of people aged 15 years or older earned an annual income of less than $20,000, compared with 38.2% of people nationally. Unemployment was at 9.0% of people 15 years or older, compared with 7.1% nationally.

== Tourism ==

The Bay of Plenty region is a popular holiday destination due to the warm and sunny summer climate and public beaches. The region received over 645,000 tourists in 2003, equivalent to one in three visitors to New Zealand coming to the region. Rotorua is a popular destination for international visitors, in particular the surrounding geothermal areas and Māori cultural centres. Tauranga is a popular domestic tourism destination, and also becoming popular internationally. Whale watching has become a popular attraction as the number of whales such as blue whales and humpback whales migrating into bay waters began to recover.

== Transport ==

The Bay of Plenty region has of rail network and of roads. The main rail line is the East Coast Main Trunk Railway, which extends from Hamilton in the Waikato region to Kawerau via Tauranga, with the Murupara Branch Railway extending the Kawerau terminus to Murupara, and the Mount Maunganui Branch connecting the Mount Maunganui terminus with the East Coast Main Trunk. The rail network is used exclusively for freight. The hub of regional economic activity is the Port of Tauranga, with well-established rail and road connections to other parts of the region. The three commercial airports are Tauranga Airport, Rotorua Airport and Whakatane Airport.

Car travel remains the dominant form of transport in the region. In 2002, the number of vehicles owned in the region was 189,000, with an average of 1.51 vehicles per household. There are public transport bus services in Tauranga and Rotorua only. Significant growth in the Western Bay of Plenty District has seen increased strain on road infrastructure, particularly with increasing traffic congestion in Tauranga. A new highway network is being planned and constructed in Tauranga to join with its current network spanning on the western side of the city. The NZ Transport Agency, in conjunction with Environment Bay of Plenty, Tauranga City and the Western Bay of Plenty District Councils, is planning to build an Eastern Motorway bypassing Te Puke, a Western Motorway bypassing Ōmokoroa and a smaller Southern Motorway.

<text>The Vanderbilt family is an American family who gained prominence during the Gilded Age. Their success began with the shipping and railroad empires of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and the family expanded into various other areas of industry and philanthropy. Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s descendants went on to build grand mansions on Fifth Avenue in New York City; luxurious &quot;summer cottages&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island; the palatial Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina; and various other opulent homes. The family also built Berkshire cottages in the western region of Massachusetts; examples include Elm Court (Lenox and Stockbridge, Massachusetts).

The Vanderbilts were once the wealthiest family in the United States. Cornelius Vanderbilt was the richest American until his death in 1877. After that, his son William Henry Vanderbilt acquired his father&#x27;s fortune, and was the richest American until his death in 1885. The Vanderbilts&#x27; prominence lasted until the mid-20th century, when the family&#x27;s 10 great Fifth Avenue mansions were torn down, and most other Vanderbilt houses were sold or turned into museums in what has been referred to as the &quot;Fall of the House of Vanderbilt&quot;.

Branches of the family are found on the United States East Coast. Contemporary descendants include American art historian John Wilmerding, journalist Anderson Cooper (son of Gloria Vanderbilt), actor Timothy Olyphant, musician John P. Hammond, screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and the Duke of Marlborough James Spencer-Churchill.

== History ==

The progenitor of the Vanderbilt family was Jan Aertszoon or Aertson (1620–1705), a Dutch farmer from the village of De Bilt in Utrecht, Netherlands, who emigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland as an indentured servant to the Van Kouwenhoven family in 1650. The name of Jan&#x27;s village, in the genitive case, was added to the Dutch &quot;van&quot; (&quot;from&quot;) to create &quot;Van der Bilt&quot;, which evolved into &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; when the English took control of New Amsterdam (now Manhattan). The family is associated with the Dutch patrician Van der Bilt.
His great-great-great-grandson, Cornelius Vanderbilt, began the rise of the Vanderbilt dynasty. He was the fourth of nine children born into a Staten Island family of modest means. Through his paternal great-great grandmother, Abigail Southard, he descends from Republic of Salé President Jan Janszoon and his son Anthony Janszoon van Salee. They were among the earliest arrivals to 17th-century New Amsterdam. In a number of documents dating back to that period, Anthony is described as tawny, as his mother was of Berber origin from Cartagena in the Kingdom of Murcia. Cornelius Vanderbilt left school at age 11 and went on to build a shipping and railroad empire that, during the 19th century, would make him one of the wealthiest men in the world. 

Starting with a single commercial boat for crossing from Staten Island to Manhattan, he grew his fleet until he was competing with Robert Fulton for dominance of the New York waterways, his energy and eagerness earning him the nickname &quot;Commodore&quot;, a United States Navy title for a captain of a small task force. Fulton&#x27;s company had established a monopoly on trade in and out of New York Harbor. Vanderbilt, based in New Jersey at the time, flouted the law, steaming in and out of the harbor under a flag that read, &quot;New Jersey Must Be Free!&quot; He also hired the attorney Daniel Webster to argue his case before the United States Supreme Court; Vanderbilt won, thereby establishing an early precedent for the United States&#x27; first laws of interstate commerce.

While many Vanderbilt family members had joined the Episcopal Church, Cornelius Vanderbilt remained a member of the Moravian Church to his death. 
The Vanderbilt family lived on Staten Island until the mid-1800s, when the Commodore built a house on Washington Place (in what is now Greenwich Village). Although he always occupied a relatively modest home, members of his family would use their wealth to build magnificent mansions. Shortly before his death in 1877, Vanderbilt donated US$1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the establishment of Vanderbilt University in Nashville.

The Commodore left the majority of his enormous fortune to his eldest son, William Henry Vanderbilt. William Henry, who outlived his father by just eight years, increased the profitability of his father&#x27;s holdings, increased the reach of the New York Central Railroad, and doubled the Vanderbilt wealth. He was the only heir to increase the Vanderbilt fortune. He built the first of what would become many grand Vanderbilt mansions on Fifth Avenue, at 640 Fifth Avenue. William Henry appointed his first son, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, as the next &quot;Head of House&quot;.

Cornelius II built the largest private home in New York, at 1 West 57th Street, containing approximately 154 rooms, designed by George B. Post. He also built The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island.

Cornelius II&#x27;s brother, William Kissam Vanderbilt, also featured prominently in the family&#x27;s affairs. He also built a home on Fifth Avenue and would become one of the great architectural patrons of the Gilded Age, hiring the architects for (the third, and surviving) Grand Central Terminal. He also built Marble House at 596 Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island.

George Washington Vanderbilt II, the 4th and youngest son of William Henry Vanderbilt and youngest brother of Cornelius II, hired architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to construct Biltmore Estate on near Asheville, North Carolina. The 250 room mansion, with of floor space, is the largest house in the United States.

While some of Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s descendants gained fame in business, others achieved prominence in other ways:
* Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (1877–1915), was a passenger on the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; and died when it sank.
* Alfred&#x27;s eldest son, from his first marriage, William Henry Vanderbilt III was Governor of Rhode Island.
* Alfred&#x27;s second son Alfred Jr. became a noted horse breeder and racing elder.
* William Kissam Vanderbilt&#x27;s son Harold Stirling Vanderbilt (1884–1970) gained fame as a sportsman. He invented the contract form of bridge and won the most coveted prize in yacht racing, the America&#x27;s Cup, on three occasions.
* Harold&#x27;s brother William Kissam &quot;Willie K&quot; Vanderbilt II launched the Vanderbilt Cup for auto racing.
* Cornelius Vanderbilt II&#x27;s granddaughter Gloria Vanderbilt (1924–2019) was a noted artist, designer, actress, author, and business woman.
* Gloria&#x27;s son, Anderson Cooper, is a Peabody Award and Emmy Award-winning journalist, author, and television producer and personality.
* Cornelius Vanderbilt II&#x27;s daughter Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney was a sculptor, art patron and collector, and founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art.

In 1855, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt donated of property to the Moravian Church and Cemetery at New Dorp on Staten Island, New York. Later, his son William Henry Vanderbilt donated a further . The Vanderbilt Family Mausoleum was designed in 1885 by architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted.

<text>William Morton Wheeler (March 19, 1865 – April 19, 1937) was an American entomologist, myrmecologist and professor at Harvard University.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
William Morton Wheeler was born on March 19, 1865, to parents Julius Morton Wheeler and Caroline Georgiana Wheeler ( Anderson) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At a young age, Wheeler had an interest in natural history, first being when he observed a moth ensnared in a spiders web; such observation interested Wheeler that he became importunate for more nature lore. Wheeler attended public school, but, due to &quot;persistently bad behavior&quot;, he was transferred to a local German academy which was known for its extreme discipline. After he completed his courses in the German academy, he attended a German normal school. In both institutions, Wheeler was trained in a variety of subjects: he was given training in languages, philosophy and science. By this time, he could read fluently in French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin and Spanish. While he was a student at the German academy, Wheeler would frequently observe the old museum of natural history at the institution.

In 1884, Henry August Ward, proprietor of the Ward&#x27;s Natural Science Establishment, brought a collection of stuffed and skeletonized mammals, birds and reptiles, and also a series of marine invertebrates to the academy. This was to persuade the city fathers to purchase them and combine them with the present collection at the academy, in which it would lay the foundation for a free municipal museum
of natural history. Wheeler, who had familiarized himself with the museum since childhood, volunteered to spend the nights in helping to unpack and install the specimens. Impressed by his enthusiasm, Ward offered Wheeler a job in his Rochester, New York establishment. His first duties were to identify and list birds and mammals and the preparation of catalogues. He was later made a foreman and spent most of his time identifying and arranging the collection of shells, echinoderms, and sponges, as well as preparing catalogues and price lists of these specimens for publication.

In 1885, Wheeler returned to Milwaukee to teach German and physiology at a high school. At the time, George W. Peckham was the principal of the school, in which Wheeler and Peckham formed a close working relationship. Wheeler collaborated with some of Peckham&#x27;s published papers by illustrating the palpi and epigynes of spiders, and by assisting him and his wife with their field work on wasps. Wheeler was also under the influence of C.O. Whitman and William Patten, who were embryologists at the Allis Lake Laboratory in Milwaukee. He was inspired by Patten to study insect embryology and did so for several years. During this time, Wheeler left the high school in 1887 and become a custodian at Milwaukee Public Museum, a position he held until 1890. He studied embryology at home and after work hours, in which he had set up a small laboratory. He left Milwaukee after leaving the museum to assist Whitman at Clark University, and, by 1892, secured a doctorate in philosophy; his dissertation was &quot;Contribution to Insect Embryology&quot;. At the same time, Wheeler commenced his work on insects and published around 10 entomological papers, which presented himself as a candidate for the degree of Ph.D. After receiving a call from the University of Chicago, Whitman subsequently accepted their offer, followed by Wheeler who was appointed under him as instructor in embryology in 1892. He held this position until 1897, where he became the assistant professor in his chosen field. Before he began his duties at Chicago, Wheeler was given a year&#x27;s absence, allowing him to study in Europe between 1893 and 1894. There, he first spent time at the Zoological Institute at the University of Würzburg as a student, and also at the Naples Zoological Station. Enamoured by the fauna of Naples, Wheeler studied the sex life of &quot;Myzostoma&quot;, a subject he further studied at the Institut Zoologique at Liege, Belgium. His monograph on &quot;Myzostoma&quot; was published in 1897 by professor E. Van Beneden in the &quot;Archives de Biologie&quot;.

===Career===
In 1894 Wheeler returned to the University of Chicago where he was a teacher of embryology for five years. He continued to publish papers, half of which involved insects. In 1898, Wheeler married Dora Bay Emerson in Chicago, where they had met earlier. In 1899, he was offered the &quot;Professorship In Zoology&quot; following the death of professor Norman of the University of Texas. There, he took the opportunity to reorganize the department as professor of zoology. He remained there until 1903, but during this period was when Wheeler developed an interest in the behavior and classification of ants. The ants would eventually become the predominant group of insects he studied. His two children were also born in Rockford, Illinois while he was staying in Texas.

A number of students sought to study under Wheeler; notable entomologists such as C. T. Brues and A. L. Melander made their way to Austin and spent several years studying there in his laboratory. This began an influx of young students, both who were pupils and scientific associates, to study and research for long periods of time under his guidance. Other students include C. L. Metcalf, T. B. Mitchell, O. E. Plath, George Salt, Alfred C. Kinsey, George C. Wheeler, Frank M. Carpenter, William S. Creighton, Neal A. Weber, J. G. Myers, William M. Mann, Marston Bates and Philip J. Darlington.

In 1903, Wheeler resigned from his position at the University of Texas and accepted the position &quot;Curator of Invertebrate Zoology&quot; at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

Wheeler was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1909 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1912.

A close contact of the British myrmecologist and coleopterist Horace Donisthorpe, it was to Wheeler whom Donisthorpe dedicated his first major book on ants in 1915. Donisthorpe and Wheeler also frequently exchanged specimens, leading the latter to first develop the idea that the Formicinae subfamily had its origins in North America.

Wheeler was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1916.

For his work, &quot;Ants of the American Museum Congo Expedition&quot;, Wheeler was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1922. He was professor of applied biology at Harvard University&#x27;s Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States.

In 1924 he spent about two months in Panama with Dr. Nathan Banks, collecting invertebrates around Barro Colorado and along the railroad in the vicinity of Panama City.
Wheeler led the Harvard Australian Expedition (1931–1932) on behalf of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, a six-man venture sent for the dual purpose of procuring specimens - the museum being &quot;weak in Australian animals and...desires[ing] to complete its series&quot; - and to engage in &quot;the study of the animals of the region when alive.&quot; The mission was success with over 300 mammal and thousands of insect specimens returning to the United States.

Wheeler was elected in 1901 a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1906 a fellow of the Entomological Society of America.

A species of gecko, &quot;Nephrurus wheeleri&quot;, is named in his honor.

His work includes 467 titles.

<doc id="330864" wikidata="Q2316110" url="?curid=330864" title="Noddy (character)">
<text>Noddy is an English character created by English children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton. He is a wooden toy doll depicted as having a childlike view of the world. Noddy first appeared in a book series published between 1949 and 1963, illustrated by the Dutch artist Harmsen van der Beek from 1949 until his death in 1953, after which the work was continued by Peter Wienk. Television shows based on the character have run on British television since 1955.

==History, concept and creation==
Noddy was created by Enid Blyton in 1949 as he appeared in the first book &quot;Noddy goes to Toyland&quot;. Starting in 1962 since the character&#x27;s success, the character was named in France called &quot;Oui-Oui&quot;, meaning Yes-Yes in French.

==Character biography==

The first book explains Noddy&#x27;s origins. He is made by a woodcarver in a toy shop but runs away after the man begins to make a wooden lion, which scares Noddy. As he wanders through the woods naked, penniless, and homeless, he meets Big Ears, a friendly brownie. Big Ears decides that Noddy is a toy and takes him to live in Toyland. He generously provides Noddy with a set of clothing and a house. While Noddy is quite happy to be a toy, the citizens of Toyland are not sure that he actually is one. They put Noddy on trial and examine whether he is a toy or an ornament. Eventually, Noddy is declared a toy, but still has to convince the court that he is a good toy. The judge accepts that Noddy is good after a doll tells the court that he saved her little girl from a lion, and he is allowed to stay in Toyland. Noddy gets his car in the second book. It is given to him after he helps solve a local mystery.
The other toys can hear him coming by the distinctive &quot;Parp Parp&quot; sound of his car&#x27;s horn and the jingle of the bell on his blue hat. Often he uses his car to visit all of the places in Toyland. When his taxi business is not doing so well, or when he needs help, Noddy turns to Big Ears. Big Ears will often lend him what he needs. On occasion, Noddy will allow people to make his head nod, in exchange for small items such as his morning milk.

Noddy is kind and honest, but he often gets into trouble, either through his own misunderstandings or because someone, usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo, has played a trick on him. He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result. For example, in the first Noddy book, Noddy and Big Ears are building Noddy&#x27;s house for one. Noddy suggests that they build the roof first, in case it rains. With no understanding of gravity or of the need for roof supports, this is perfectly logical to him. As the series continues, Noddy becomes wiser but without losing his charm and lovable naivety.
Noddy&#x27;s best friends are Big Ears, Tessie Bear, Bumpy Dog, and the Tubby Bears. Big Ears, who brought Noddy to Toyland, is the most important figure in his life. Whenever he faces serious peril, it tends to be Big Ears who comes to the rescue, one way or another, and it is invariably Big Ears to whom Noddy turns for support and advice. While kind to Noddy, Big Ears has an intimidating presence and voice that makes him feared by goblins. He is capable of facing down wizards with his own spells, and is able to plead Noddy&#x27;s case to Mr. Plod, the local policeman, when Noddy finds himself in legal peril. On rare occasions, however, Big Ears finds himself in trouble, in which case Noddy comes to his aid. Big Ears and Noddy have rarely quarreled seriously. Examples of such quarrels are when Big Ears harshly scolded the very sensitive Tessie Bear for failing to control her dog and when Noddy ran his car into Big Ears&#x27;s clothes post and then drove away, dragging Big Ears&#x27;s clean washing behind him.

Tessie is a gentle-hearted, gold bear who often wears a bonnet with flowers and a skirt. She is young like Noddy, and very loving towards all of her friends and neighbours. Bumpy Dog is Tessie&#x27;s pet. He loves to run up and &quot;bump&quot; people over. Noddy frequently gets annoyed with Bumpy but still likes him. Whenever Noddy threatens Bumpy, Tessie gets upset, and sometimes even begins to cry. The Tubby Bears live next door to Noddy. They are gold and chubby teddy bears. Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear frequently help Noddy. It is clear that Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear are the superiors of Noddy, as if he were a child. Their first names are never mentioned and Noddy always refers to them as Mr. and Mrs. They have one son, also named Tubby, who is occasionally referred to as Master Tubby. Tubby is naughty and is usually in trouble for breaking rules, being rude, or doing something wrong. Noddy often attempts to scold or punish Tubby, with little result. On one occasion, Tubby gets tired of always being bossed around and being punished and decides to run away to sea. Noddy and Bumpy accidentally join with him. By the end of the journey, Tubby misses his parents and brings them back presents from his trip, as an apology.

Noddy has many run-ins with Mr. Plod. Some are caused by Noddy&#x27;s lack of understanding of how Toyland works. Other times it is because of a case of mistaken identity, Mr. Plod is generally long-suffering towards Noddy and Noddy likes Mr. Plod and frequently goes out of his way to help him. Mr. Plod often catches the mischief makers on his police bicycle, by blowing his whistle and shouting &quot;Halt in the name of Plod!!&quot; before locking the culprits up in his jail.

==Characters==

===Current characters===
====Major characters====
* Big Ears, a wise, bearded brownie who lives in a toadstool house outside of Toyland and is Noddy&#x27;s helper and father figure, as well as his best friend. He finds Noddy and brings him to Toyland at the start of the first book. Big Ears, while usually kind to Noddy, can be very fierce and is both feared and respected by goblins, wizards, and even Mr. Plod. Whenever Noddy is being mistreated, he invariably comes to his defence. Big Ears also has the power to cast magic spells, though he rarely uses it. His catchphrase is &quot;You funny little Noddy!&quot;.
* Mr. Plod (sometimes called PC Plod), the local policeman. He has an uneven relationship with Noddy, whom he thinks drives too fast and engages in other unwarranted behaviour. He has gone so far as to imprison Noddy at least once, and threatened him with imprisonment on other occasions. His catchphrase is &quot;Stop, in the name of Plod!&quot;, as shown in &quot;Make Way for Noddy.&quot;
* Tessie Bear, a clever young female teddy bear who is Noddy&#x27;s friend. She has recently been replaced by a female panda named Pat-Pat.

* Mr. Train Driver, the train driver who drives the Toyland Express train.
* Twinkly, a star who has appeared in &quot;Catch a Falling Star.&quot;

==Books==

Early Noddy books have become collectibles, along with other Blytons. The total number is hard to count: the &quot;Noddy Library&quot; (Sampson Low) of two dozen titles, which became the &quot;New Noddy Library&quot; when revised, was just part of a big production in the 1950s, with &quot;Big Noddy Books&quot; of larger format, and strip books. There were numerous spin-offs, also. Widely differing estimates can be found.

The 24 original Noddy books by Enid Blyton were published between 1949 and 1963. Harmsen Van der Beek illustrated the first 7 Noddy books. After Beek&#x27;s death in 1953 the original style was maintained by illustrators Robert Tyndall, Peter Wienk, Mary Brooks and Robert Lee.

Sales of Noddy books are large, with an estimated 600,000 annual sales in France alone, and growing popularity in India and Portugal, a large market for Blyton books. The Noddy character was formerly owned by Chorion, who sold the rights on to DreamWorks Classics (a part of DreamWorks Animation which now a subsidiary of NBCUniversal) in 2012.

Separate Book: &quot;Noddy and Big-Ears &quot; (1952)

On 17 November 2008, it was announced that Enid Blyton&#x27;s granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, was to write a new Noddy book to celebrate the character&#x27;s 60th birthday. &quot;Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle&quot; (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall, who has drawn the characters in the Noddy books since 1953, ever since the death of the original illustrator, Harmsen van der Beek.

==Television adaptations and other incarnations==
In the 1990s and early 2000s TV series adaptation, as well as a new series of books, Noddy has been updated, with the original Golliwog characters replaced by other sorts of toys. For example, Mr. Golly who ran the Toyland garage was replaced by Frenchman Monsieur Polly in the 1975 series, and, during the 1992–2000 series, by Mr. Sparks.

==Stage productions==

Noddy first appeared on stage at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London, in 1954. The very large cast were all children or teenagers, mostly from the Italia Conti acting school. There was a full theatre orchestra. The finale was a scene at the &quot;Faraway Tree&quot;, with many of the children dressed as fairies, flying on wires. It ran for several years, but the Stoll was knocked down and replaced by an office block in the late 1950s. The Peacock Theatre was built in the basement of the new building, but Noddy did not return.

In 1963, Noddy was featured in the animated short film &quot;Noddy Goes to Toyland&quot;, it was produced by Arthur Humberstone for Enid Blyton.

In 1993, a stage production of Noddy opened at the New Wimbledon Theatre, followed by a long UK national tour, including a Christmas season in London at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, and was released on home video in 1994. The production was presented by Clarion Productions. The production was written and directed by David Wood with scene and costume designs by Susie Calcutt. The original cast included Eric Potts as Big Ears and Karen Briffett as Noddy. The show was very well received among critics, audiences and even Enid Blyton&#x27;s daughter Gillian Baverstock. David Wood adapted a successful sequel to the play entitled &quot;Noddy and the Tootle&quot; which opened at the Wimbledon Theatre and endured on a long UK National Tour in 1995–1996. Karen Briffett reprised her role as Noddy and Big Ears was played by Jonathan Broxholme. This production was too presented by Clarion Productions.

The characters returned during September 2002 for an animated series, which was named &quot;Make Way for Noddy&quot;. This was created by Chorion, in association with SD Entertainment and the 100 episodes were produced in 2001 externally.

In 2004, A live show called &quot;Noddy Live!&quot; that takes a live tour around the UK from December 21, 2004 until March 5 2005, and returns on December 21 until December 29 in the same year.

In 2005, a set of 100 new two-minute TV interstitials were created by Chorion. These interstitials, entitled &quot;Say it with Noddy&quot;, feature Noddy learning words in a variety of foreign languages. They also introduced Noddy&#x27;s new friend Whizz from Robot Village, who presses a button on his chest to play recordings of native speakers saying the new foreign words Noddy was to learn. The interstitials were featured on commercial breaks on Five and featured as segments for the American release of the show on PBS and Sprout.

A CG animated series, called &quot;Noddy in Toyland&quot;, was made in 2009 by Chorion and produced by Brown Bag Films in Ireland. This series incorporates Whizz from &quot;Say it with Noddy&quot; as a full-time character. Sly and Gobbo&#x27;s cousins, Sneaky and Stealth, are introduced and usually work alongside them. The full series is available digitally on iTunes.

In 2012, Chorion sold the Noddy character to ClassicMedia, which in turn was bought out by DreamWorks Animation, leading to another CG animated series, named &quot;Noddy, Toyland Detective&quot; was produced by French producer/distributor Gaumont Animation, in association with DreamWorks Animation Television, and in partnership with France Télévisions. It premiered on Channel Five&#x27;s preschool block Milkshake! on 18 April 2016.
==Other media==

There was a spoof page of &quot;Noddy-ana&quot; in &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine (U.K.), in about 1976–1978; Noddy had a hot rod, and Big Ears smoked, and was very disrespectful to Mr. Plod.

In the book &quot;Seven Deadly Wonders&quot; by Matthew Reilly, a character is nicknamed Noddy, while his best friend&#x27;s nickname is Big Ears.

IDW&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers&quot; introduced the character of &quot;Tappet&quot;, a robot who is based on Noddy visually and clearly transforms into Noddy&#x27;s classic car.

The puppet of Big Ears from the 1955–1963 Noddy television series appeared as a member of the &quot;Puppet Government&quot; in &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&quot;.

In Alan Moore&#x27;s series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Toyland is a real nation located in the Arctic Circle. The King and Queen of Toyland are Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and Olympia, the automaton from &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

Noddy, Big Ears and PC Plod are referred to in the &quot;Two Ronnies&quot; crossword sketch where Ronnie Corbett thinks their names are &quot;Roddy, Big Ears, and PC Plop!&quot;

In an episode of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, all of the characters are dressed up as fairy tale characters for a parade. Smiler is dressed as Noddy complete with a smaller version of his car in order to tow a bouncy castle with the rest of the characters on it, but it deflated while they were taking part.

==Legacy==

Noddy being associated with small children&#x27;s reading has led to &quot;Noddy&quot; being sometimes used as an adjective meaning &quot;petty or trivial&quot; (compare with &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;), for example, in computer programming: &quot;&quot;This simultaneous linear equation subroutine crashes out on the Noddy case when n = 1, but otherwise it works.&quot; or &quot;Remember to check all the Noddy cases.&quot;&quot;

In the United Kingdom, the word &quot;plod&quot; became a slang term to describe a police officer, or the police service, due to the success of the Noddy franchise, and its character Mr. Plod. For example, somebody could say, “I’m not having a good morning, I was driving to work and got pulled over by the plod for driving too fast”. The Ministry of Defence Police is also nicknamed &quot;MOD Plod&quot;.

<text>Rotorua () is a city in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is sited on the southern shores of Lake Rotorua, from which it takes its name. It is the seat of the Rotorua Lakes District, a territorial authority encompassing Rotorua and several other nearby towns. It has an estimated resident population of , making it the country&#x27;s 13th largest urban area, and the Bay of Plenty&#x27;s second-largest urban area behind Tauranga.

Māori first settled in Rotorua in the 14th century, and a thriving pā was established at Ohinemutu by the people who would become Ngāti Whakaue. The city became closely associated with conflict during the Musket Wars of the 1820s. Ohinemutu was invaded by a Ngāpuhi-led coalition in 1823, commanded by Hongi Hika and Pōmare I. In the 19th century early European settlers had an interest in developing Rotorua, due to its unique geothermal activity in Rotorua and its surrounding area. Then, efforts by Māori and Europeans alike to establish Rotorua as a spa town led to a 99-year lease of land from Ngāti Whakaue to the Government. The city first became a major site of tourism due to the Rotorua&#x27;s close proximity to the Pink and White Terraces, until they were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886. Rotorua was elevated to borough status in 1922 and to city status 40 years later.

Rotorua is a major destination for both domestic and international tourists; the tourism industry is by far the largest industry in the district. It is known for its geothermal activity and Māori cultural tourism, and features geysers – notably the Pōhutu Geyser at Whakarewarewa – and hot mud pools. This thermal activity is sourced to the Rotorua Caldera, in which the city lies.

== Toponymy ==
The name Rotorua comes from the Māori language, where the full name for the city and lake is . &quot;Roto&quot; means &#x27;lake&#x27; and &quot;rua&quot; means &#x27;two&#x27; or in this case, &#x27;second&#x27; – Rotorua thus meaning &#x27;Second lake&#x27;. Kahumatamomoe was the uncle of the Māori chief Ihenga, the ancestral explorer of the Te Arawa. It was the second major lake the chief discovered, and he dedicated it to his uncle. It is the largest of a multitude of lakes found to the northeast, all connected with the Rotorua Caldera and nearby Mount Tarawera. The name can also mean the equally appropriate &#x27;Crater lake&#x27;.

A common nickname for Rotorua is &quot;Sulphur City&quot; due to the hydrogen sulphide emissions, which gives the city a smell similar to &quot;rotten eggs&quot;, as well as &quot;Rotten-rua&quot; combining its legitimate name and the rotten smell prevalent. Another common nickname is &quot;Roto-Vegas&quot;, likening the city&#x27;s own strip of road flanked by businesses and restaurants to that of Las Vegas.

== History ==
The area was initially settled by Māori of the Te Arawa iwi in the 14th century, and a thriving pā was built at Ohinemutu by the shores of Lake Rotorua. According to Te Arawa folklore, the city&#x27;s bountiful geothermal springs had resulted from a plea by Ngātoro-i-rangi, an ancestral tohunga, for the gods to send fire-bearing spirits from Hawaiki, the semi-mythological Māori homeland. The Te Arawa Māori who lived at Ohinemutu eventually began to call themselves Ngāti Whakaue, after their ancestor Whakaue Kaipapa.

Rotorua was a site of heavy conflict during the Musket Wars. During the early 1820s, the large Northern iwi Ngāpuhi had begun expanding outwards further south, driving Ngāti Pāoa and their chief Te Hīnaki from modern-day South Auckland, and launched periodic raids into the Bay of Plenty. A military expedition into the Bay of Plenty by a combined Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Maru nō Hauraki force in 1818 had set the stage for further raids in the modern Rotorua area. Ngāpuhi and its allies launched an ambitious invasion of the Waikato in 1822, with a battalion led by junior chief Te Pae-o-te-Rangi were ambushed and slaughtered by Ngāti Whakaue for trespassing into Rotorua. This was apparently at the insistence of Te Rauparaha; under Māori customary law the attack demanded &quot;utu&quot;. Ngāpuhi commander Hongi Hika convened with his fellow chiefs Pōmare I and Te Wera Hauraki to propose war, and thus in February 1823 a Ngāpuhi-led coalition invaded Rotorua. The force, which also included Ngāti Whātua and some Waikato Tainui, landed at Tauranga and headed up the Pongakawa valley to attack Mokoia Island Te Arawa fell back after the loss of 170 men and were defeated by Ngāpuhi, and utu was satisfied.

The first European in the area was probably Phillip Tapsell who was trading from the Bay of Plenty coast at Maketu from 1828. He later married into Te Arawa and became highly regarded by them. Missionaries Henry Williams and Thomas Chapman visited in 1831 and Chapman and his wife established a mission at Te Koutu in 1835. This was abandoned within a year, but Chapman returned in 1838 and established a second mission at Mokoia Island.

The lakeshore was a prominent site of skirmishes during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. William Fox advocated for turning the Rotorua region into a national park, inspired by the Yellowstone in the United States. Conversely, the Te Arawa community suggested the establishment of a township centred around Rotorua&#x27;s thermal springs, with the intent of developing a Polynesian Spa and health resort where tourists could indulge in hot pools. In 1880, instead of selling the land, the Ngāti Whakaue people leased 50 acres to the Crown under the Fenton Agreement, granting the government the authority to offer 99-year leases on their behalf. Revenues from leases helped fund Rotorua Boys&#x27; High School, and increased significantly upon the expiry of the 99-year leases. The eponymous Fenton Street in the modern city’s CBD bears the judge’s name. Nevertheless, the enactment of the &quot;Thermal Springs District Act&quot; in 1881 gave the government exclusive rights to both purchase and lease lands containing hot springs, lakes, or river, and as a result, by the turn of the century, nearly half of the Rotorua blocks were sold. In 1993, the Crown settled a Treaty of Waitangi claim with the Ngāti Whakaue people to honour their broken contract, by agreeing to return the gifted lands that were no longer required for their original use.

The town was connected to Auckland with the opening of the Rotorua Branch railway and commencement of the Rotorua Express train in 1894, resulting in the rapid growth of the town and tourism from this time forward. Guidebooks about the &#x27;Land of Boiling Water&#x27; also proliferated. During the 1880s, tourists, especially from Australia, started visiting Rotorua to witness its natural marvels like the Pink and White Terraces until these were destroyed in a volcanic eruption in 1886. Rotorua was established as a borough in 1922, elected its first mayor in 1923, and declared a city in 1962 before becoming a district in 1979.

==Geography==

=== Setting ===

The city of Rotorua and the adjacent Lake Rotorua are located within the Rotorua Caldera that was formed in a major volcanic eruption approximately 240,000 years ago. The caldera is the source of the geothermal activity that is a key feature of the city and surrounding region.

=== Climate ===
The Rotorua region enjoys a mild temperate climate (Cfb). Rotorua is situated inland from the coast and is sheltered by high country to the south and east of the city, resulting in less wind than many other places in New Zealand. During the winter months, June – August, temperatures can drop below 0 °C. Frost is common in Rotorua during its winter months, with an average of 57 ground frosts annually, and 20 nights per year below 0 °C. Snowfall in Rotorua is rare, and since the 1970s has only been recorded twice. On 15 August 2011 and 13 July 2017, snowflakes fell in the town centre, and during the July 2017 snowfall, snow accumulated in the nearby Mamaku ranges and in the outer reaches of the district, where snowfall occurs on average once every three years.

===Lakes===
The Rotorua region has 17 lakes, known collectively as the Lakes of Rotorua. Fishing, waterskiing, swimming and other water activities are popular in summer. Several of the lakes are stocked for sports fishing with trout from the Fish and Game New Zealand hatchery at Ngongotahā. The lakes are also used for event venues; Rotorua hosted the 2007 World Waterski Championships and Lake Rotorua was the venue for the World Blind Sailing Championships in March 2009. Lake Rotorua is also used as a departure and landing point for float planes.

===Suburbs===
;Inner suburbs
;Outer suburbs
== Demography ==
The Rotorua urban area, as defined by Statistics New Zealand, covers and incorporates 26 statistical areas. It has an estimated population of as of .

Before the 2023 census, the urban area had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, The Rotorua urban area had a usual resident population of 54,204 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 5,289 people (10.8%) since the 2013 census. There were 26,211 males and 27,993 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.936 males per female. Of the total population, 12,366 people (22.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 11,052 (20.4%) were 15 to 29, 22,980 (42.4%) were 30 to 64, and 7,809 (14.4%) were 65 or older.

In terms of ethnicity, 59.2% were European/Pākehā, 42.3% were Māori, 6.2% were Pacific peoples, 11.5% were Asian, and 1.5% were other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). Rotorua has the highest proportion of Māori of any city in New Zealand.

==Government==

=== Local ===

In October 2013, Steve Chadwick was elected Mayor of Rotorua and was re-elected in the 2016 mayoral election and the 2019 mayoral election. She previously served as the Member of Parliament for Rotorua between 1999 and 2008, and served as a Cabinet Minister in the Fifth Labour Government.

In 2022, Tania Tapsell was elected as the Mayor of Rotorua. She is the first woman of Māori descent to hold the role.

=== National ===
Rotorua is covered by the Rotorua electorate for the general roll and the Waiariki electorate for the Māori roll.

== Economy ==
In 2022, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Rotorua District was $4.241 billion, representing 1.2% of New Zealand&#x27;s total GDP. The sector with the largest contribution to the Rotorua District GDP was high value services (professional, managerial, as well as scientific and technical occupations), at 20%. This is less than the 26.7% contribution that high value services make to the national economy. The next highest contribution to the district GDP was from goods-producing industries representing 17.8% in the district GDP, versus 18.5% in the national economy. Primary industries, agriculture and forestry, contributed 10.2%, compared with 5.8% in the national economy.

As a major visitor destination, Rotorua District has a much higher proportion of people in employed in accommodation (3.3%) than the national average (1.1%). Tourism contributed $231 million (5.5%) to the district GDP, compared with 2.8% nationally. The four largest industries in the district, based on employment, were hospitals, accommodation, cafes and restaurants, and primary education.

== Geothermal attractions ==
Known as a spa town and major tourist resort since the 1800s, many of Rotorua&#x27;s buildings reflect this history. Government Gardens, close to the lake-shore at the eastern edge of the town, include the Rotorua Museum of Art and History housed in the large Tudor-style bath house building, and the Art Deco style Blue Baths, noted for its embrace of mixed sex bathing in the 1930s. , both buildings are closed because of earthquake strength concerns.

There are many geothermal attractions in the Rotorua area, including:

* Kuirau Park, in the central city
* Government Gardens, including Sulphur Point
* Te Puia – a visitor attraction located in the Whakarewarewa volcanic valley, and home of the Pōhutu Geyser
* Tikitere – Hell&#x27;s Gate Geothermal Park &amp; Mud Spa
* Te Wairoa (&quot;The Buried Village&quot;) — so named after it was buried by the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption
* Lake Rotomahana
* Waimangu Volcanic Valley
* Waikite Valley Thermal Pools

The especially pungent smell in the central-east &#x27;Te Ngae&#x27; area is due to the dense sulphur deposits located next to the southern boundary of the Government Gardens, in the area known as &#x27;Sulphur Point&#x27;.

== Mountain biking ==
Another of Rotorua&#x27;s attractions is mountain biking. Rotorua was listed as one of the Top 6 mountain biking destinations globally by the International Mountain Biking Association in 2015, when they awarded Rotorua the gold level ride centre status. The Whakarewarewa forest includes over 150 km of mountain bike trails and in August 2006 was a host of the UCI Mountain Bike and Trials World Championships.

==Transport==

===Road===
Rotorua is served by state highways 5, 30, and 30A, and the Thermal Explorer Highway touring route, with state highways 33 and 36 terminating on the outskirts of the city.

State Highway 5, running concurrently with the Thermal Explorer Highway, is the main north–south route through Rotorua, bypassing the city centre to the west. North of the city at Ngongotahā, State Highway 36 splits off to provide a route to Tauranga via Pyes Pa, while State Highway 5 turns westward, connecting to State Highway 1 at Tīrau and providing the main route into Rotorua from Hamilton and Auckland. To the south, State Highway 5 provides the main route from Taupō, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, and Wellington.

State Highway 30 runs southwest to northeast through the city. It enters the city in the southwest (running concurrently with SH 5), before crossing the southern suburbs to the shore of Lake Rotorua east of the city centre. It then runs through the suburb of Te Ngae, before splitting off SH 33 to continue eastwards.

State Highway 30A runs northwest to southeast, connecting State Highways 5 and 30 with each other via the city centre.

===Bus===
Rotorua has a local bus service, with 11 routes under the Baybus brand, serving the urban area, mostly at half-hourly intervals, operated by Reesby Buses. Bike racks were introduced in 2017 and Bee Cards for fares on 27 July 2020. Trial commuter services between Rotorua and Tauranga are running in each direction until the end of 2021. The city is also served by InterCity and services to local tourist sites.

==== History ====
Edwin Robertson, who died aged 74 in 1931, started with pack horses in 1869 and ran coaches from 1873. In 1902, the Tauranga route was sold and became Robertson &amp; Co, then, about 1903, Rotorua Motor Coaching Co. Ltd. In 1904, Hot Lakes Transport, which ran trips to Taupō, Waiotapu and all the lakes, and Rotorua Motor Coaching added motor cars to their fleets of coaches. In 1905 E. Robertson &amp; Co moved from Ohinemutu to the new town, close to the new railway station, which remained the main stop until InterCity moved to their stop from Hinemoa / Fenton Street to the Tourism Office in 1995. The last coach ran in 1919. When Hot Lakes Transport&#x27;s assets were sold in 1920, they had 10 coaches and 3 motor cars. In September 1920, Rotorua Motor Transport Co. was formed and took over Hot Lakes Transport Co. and Rotorua Motor Coaching Co, continuing with similar services. In 1926, a consortium of local operators formed Rotorua Bus Co. During 1922, Kusab&#x27;s transport company became K Motors, which was taken over by the railways in 1938. Rotorua Motor Transport and Rotorua Bus Co followed in 1940 and all became part of New Zealand Railways Road Services.

===Air===
Rotorua Regional Airport is located northeast of the city centre, off State Highway 30. Air New Zealand provides daily turbo-prop flights between Rotorua and Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch airports. Previously Qantas also operated Boeing 737 aircraft from Christchurch, but upon their departure from domestic flights in New Zealand this was discontinued.

Scenic and chartered flights in both helicopters and float planes are operated by Volcanic Air, who are based on Rotorua&#x27;s lake front.

From 2009 to 2015 there was also an international link, with direct Sydney to Rotorua flights.

===Rail===
Rotorua is connected to the rail network by the Rotorua Branch line from Putāruru. Until 2001, passenger trains ran from Auckland to Rotorua via Hamilton daily using Silver Fern railcars, terminating north of the town centre at Koutu (the original station on Amohau Street was closed and relocated to Koutu in 1989). However, owing to poor advertising of the service and the location of the station being a 15-minute walk from the town centre in an industrial area, passenger services stopped in October 2001. Freight services on the line declined over the decades until the nightly freight service stopped in 2000, largely due to a continual move of freight and passengers onto road transport using ever-improving highways in the region. The line is currently disused.

==Education==

===Tertiary===
Rotorua is home to the central campus of Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, which provides a range of certificates, diplomas and a limited number of degree-level programmes.

<text>The ECHL (formerly the East Coast Hockey League) is a minor professional ice hockey league based in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, with teams across the United States and Canada. Competitively, it is a tier below the American Hockey League (AHL). The league serves as a farm system to the AHL and National Hockey League (NHL).

The ECHL and the AHL are the only minor leagues recognized by the collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), meaning any player signed to an entry-level NHL contract and designated for assignment must report to a club in either the ECHL or the AHL. Additionally, the league&#x27;s players are represented by the Professional Hockey Players&#x27; Association (PHPA) in negotiations with the ECHL itself. At least 739 players have played at least one game in the NHL after appearing in the ECHL.

As of the 2024–25 season, 29 of the 32 NHL teams held affiliations with an ECHL team, with only the Carolina Hurricanes, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Ottawa Senators having no such franchise affiliation. NHL teams sometimes lend contracted players to ECHL teams with which they have no affiliation agreements for development and increased playing time.

The league&#x27;s regular season typically begins in October and ends in April, followed by the Kelly Cup playoffs. The most recent playoff champions are the Florida Everblades in 2024.

== History ==

The league, formed by Vinton, VA oil man, Henry Brabham, and for whom the regular season championship trophy, the Brabham Cup, was named, combined teams from the defunct Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL) and All-American Hockey League (AAHL), began to play as the East Coast Hockey League in 1988 with five teams – the (Winston-Salem, North) Carolina Thunderbirds (now the Wheeling Nailers); the Erie Panthers (folded in 2011 as the Victoria Salmon Kings); the Johnstown Chiefs (now the Greenville Swamp Rabbits); the Knoxville Cherokees (ceased operations as the Pee Dee Pride in 2005; folded in 2009 following failed relocation efforts); and the Virginia Lancers (now the Utah Grizzlies).

In 2003, the West Coast Hockey League ceased operations, and the ECHL board of governors approved membership applications from the Anchorage/Alaska Aces, the Bakersfield Condors, the Fresno Falcons, the Idaho Steelheads, the Las Vegas Wranglers, the Long Beach Ice Dogs and the San Diego Gulls as well as from potential teams in Ontario, California, and Reno, Nevada. Alaska, Bakersfield, Fresno, Idaho, Las Vegas, Long Beach and San Diego began play in the 2003–04 season as expansion teams. In a change reflective of the league&#x27;s now-nationwide presence, the East Coast Hockey League shortened its name to the orphan initialism ECHL on May 19, 2003. The ECHL reached its largest size to date (31 teams) that season before being reduced to 28 teams for the 2004–05 season.

The ECHL has attempted to be more tech-friendly to its fans. Some improvements on the league&#x27;s website have included a new schedule and statistics engine powered by League Stat, Inc. (introduced in 2006), internet radio coverage for most teams, and pay-per view broadcasting of ECHL games through B2 Networks (a subsidiary of America One Broadcasting). In 2008, the league introduced the ECHL toolbar for web browsers which gave users short cut access to statistics, scores, transactions, and news updates.
At the annual ECHL Board of Governors meeting on June 15, 2010, in Henderson, Nevada, the Board of Governors approved changes to the names of the conferences and divisions. The former American Conference (comprising eleven East Coast and Midwest teams) was renamed the Eastern Conference, while the National Conference (consisting of 8 West Coast teams, including the league&#x27;s only Canadian team at the time) was re-designated the Western Conference. Within the Eastern Conference, the East Division was renamed the Atlantic Division, and the Western Conference&#x27;s former West Division was dubbed the Mountain Division.

The league lost its only Canadian team with the folding of the Victoria Salmon Kings subsequent to the 2010–11 season, but increased to 20 teams for the 2011–12 season with the addition of the expansion franchise Chicago Express and the Colorado Eagles who previously played in the Central Hockey League.

With the folding of the Chicago Express at the conclusion of the 2011–12 season and the announcement of expansion franchises in Orlando, San Francisco, Evansville, and Fort Wayne (both in Indiana and both from the Central Hockey League) the league played the 2012–13 season with 23 teams. That number dropped to 22 for the 2013–14 season with the folding of the Trenton Titans and subsequently fell to 21 with the mid-season folding of the San Francisco Bulls on January 27, 2014.

On October 7, 2014, the ECHL announced that the seven remaining active members of the Central Hockey League (the Allen Americans, Brampton Beast, Quad City Mallards, Missouri Mavericks, Rapid City Rush, Tulsa Oilers and Wichita Thunder) would be admitted as new members for the 2014–15 season. The addition of the former CHL teams plus the expansion Indy Fuel raised the number of teams to 28 and placed a team in Canada for the first time since 2011.

Before the 2015–16 season, the AHL&#x27;s creation of a Pacific Division led the three California ECHL teams to relocate to former AHL cities with the Bakersfield Condors, Ontario Reign, and Stockton Thunder relocating to become the Norfolk Admirals, Manchester Monarchs, and Adirondack Thunder, respectively. By the 2018–19 season, the ECHL lost both the Quad City Mallards and Manchester Monarchs by folding, and the ECHL kept the Quad City Mallards name as a trademark. But the East Coast Hockey League expanded into other markets recently vacated by the AHL in the Maine Mariners, Newfoundland Growlers, and Worcester Railers.

There were two expansion teams added in 2021–22, the Iowa Heartlanders and the Trois-Rivières Lions, with Iowa going into the Central Division and Trois-Rivières going into the North. This brought the league up to 27 teams. The league added the Savannah Ghost Pirates, bringing the league to 28 teams, and balancing the divisions for the 2022–23 season.

There are two expansion teams to be added for the 2024–25 season; the Tahoe Knight Monsters in Stateline, NV, and the Bloomington Bison in Bloomington, IL. The Knight Monsters are planned to play in the Mountain division, with the Bison planned to compete in the Central division. These additions were intended to bring the ECHL to 30 teams before the Newfoundland Growlers folded late in the 2023–24 ECHL season, but plans are still there to expand the league to 32 in the future to match the number of teams in the NHL and the AHL per ECHL Commissioner Ryan Crelin.

On April 2, 2024, the league announced that the Newfoundland Growlers&#x27; membership had been terminated due to failure to fulfill its obligations under league bylaws, bringing the league down to 29 teams and forcing the Wheeling Nailers to move to the North Division.

On October 18, 2024, the league announced a new expansion team for Greensboro, North Carolina set to begin play for the 2025–26 ECHL season, which would be unveiled as the Greensboro Gargoyles.

==Teams==
Alignment, affiliations, and locations for the 2024–25 season.


===Future teams===
Representatives from all potential expansion franchises, markets that have been granted expansion franchises and franchises that have suspended operations must attend the league&#x27;s annual Board of Governors Meeting between seasons and provide progress reports on their situations in order to keep their ECHL franchise rights. For dormant and existing franchises, the Board of Governors votes whether or not to extend a franchise&#x27;s league license until the next Board of Governors Meeting.

At the 2012 Board of Governors meeting, the Board elected to limit the league to 26 teams, with an emphasis on adding teams to the Western Conference. However, it was decided at the 2015 Board of Governors meeting that the cap should be expanded to 30 teams, hoping to eventually match the NHL and AHL&#x27;s (then) 30-team totals. In 2023, ECHL commissioner Ryan Crelin commented that the eventual goal was to match the AHL and NHL expansion to 32 teams.

===Defunct and relocated teams===
Since starting with five franchises in its inaugural season, the ECHL has had dozens of franchises join and leave the league. Typically, these teams fold or relocate due to operation issues or financial losses. The Johnstown Chiefs became the last remaining founding franchise of the East Coast Hockey League to remain in its original city until it relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, following the completion of the 2009–10 season.

While the ECHL has stated in recent years they would not grant voluntary suspensions of franchises for more than one year, both the Toledo Storm (now the Toledo Walleye) and Mississippi Sea Wolves (now defunct) were granted two-year suspensions—the Sea Wolves because of Hurricane Katrina and the Storm in order to demolish their present arena and construct a new one in downtown Toledo. The Mississippi Sea Wolves resumed play for the 2007–08 season, while the Toledo Walleye resumed play in their new arena for the 2009–10 season.

Seven former ECHL franchises have been directly replaced in their respective markets by American Hockey League franchises. The Greensboro Monarchs were the first, being replaced by the Carolina Monarchs in 1995. The Hampton Roads Admirals were the second, giving way to the Norfolk Admirals in 2000. The Peoria Rivermen were the third. In their case, the replacement franchise retained the Worcester IceCats history but assumed the Rivermen identity for their first AHL season of 2005–06. The Charlotte Checkers were the fourth, yielding to a franchise that retained the Albany River Rats history following the club&#x27;s move to Charlotte following the 2009–10 season and assumed the Checkers identity. In each of these cases, the ECHL franchise was relinquished to the league by its respective ownership group. In 2015, the three California franchises (Bakersfield Condors, Ontario Reign, and Stockton Thunder) were displaced by the formation of an AHL Pacific Division. Each ECHL franchise involved in the territorial shift was either owned or purchased by their NHL affiliate prior to being relocated.

*Alaska Aces (2003–2017; purchased and relocated to Portland, Maine, for the 2018–19 season.)
*Arkansas RiverBlades (1999–2003)
*Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies (2001–2005; moved to Stockton, California.)
*Augusta Lynx (1998–2008; suspended operations and relinquished their membership back to the ECHL after their ownership group was unable to continue to operate in 2008–09. The first ECHL team to fold mid-season.)
*Bakersfield Condors (2003–15; the team moved to Norfolk, Virginia, to become the Norfolk Admirals and was replaced in the market by an AHL team of the same name.)
*Baton Rouge Kingfish (1996–2003; moved to Victoria, British Columbia, as the Victoria Salmon Kings.)
*Birmingham Bulls (1992–2001; moved to Atlantic City, New Jersey; now the Adirondack Thunder.)
*Brampton Beast (2014–2020; folded during the COVID-19 pandemic.)
*Carolina/Winston-Salem Thunderbirds (1988–1992; moved to Wheeling, West Virginia, as the Wheeling Thunderbirds before being renamed as the Wheeling Nailers.)
*Charlotte Checkers (1993–2010; replaced by the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL.)
*Chesapeake Icebreakers (1997–1999; moved to Jackson, Mississippi.)
*Chicago Express (2011–2012; membership relinquished to ECHL.)
*Colorado Eagles (2011–2018; organization obtained an expansion franchise in the AHL.)
*Columbia Inferno (2001–2008; voluntarily suspended operations.)
*Columbus Chill (1991–1999; suspended operations due to the then-impending entry of the Columbus Blue Jackets into the NHL; franchise purchased and relocated to Reading, Pennsylvania.)

===Timeline===

==Kelly Cup playoff format==
For the 2012–13 season, eight teams still qualify in the Eastern Conference: the three division winners plus the next five teams in the conference. With the addition of the expansion franchise in San Francisco, the Board of Governors changed the Western Conference seeding such that eight teams qualify: two division winners and the next six teams in the conference. This eliminated the Western Conference first-round bye.

Similar to the National Hockey League (NHL) at the time, the division winners were seeded as the top three seeds in the Eastern Conference and the top two seeds in the Western Conference; the conference winner faced the eighth seed, second faces seventh, third faces sixth and fourth faces fifth in the conference quarterfinal round. The winner of the 1st/8th series played the winner of the 4th/5th series while the 2nd/7th winner played against the 3rd/6th winner in the conference semifinal series. The Board of Governors also elected to change the playoff format such that all rounds of the playoffs are now best of seven series. For 2012–13, the Conference Finals and Kelly Cup Finals will use a two-referee system.

Because of the late addition of the CHL teams for the 2014–15 season and its subsequent conference alignment, the top four teams in each division qualified for the playoffs and the first two playoff rounds were played within the divisions.

For the realignment prior to the 2015–16 season, the playoffs changed once again to a six-division format. At the end of the regular season, the top team in each division qualified for the playoffs and be seeded either 1, 2, or 3 based on the highest point total earned in the season. Then the five non-division winning teams with the highest point totals in each conference qualified for the playoffs and be seeded 4 through 8. All four rounds will be a best-of-seven format.

The alignment changed back to four divisions for the 2016–17 season, but the playoffs kept the divisional format. The top four teams in each division qualify for the playoffs and play in the division for the first two rounds. After the division finals, the winners then play the conference finals and followed by the Kelly Cup finals.

==ECHL Hall of Fame==

In celebration of the league&#x27;s 20th year of play, the ECHL Board of Governors created the ECHL Hall of Fame in 2008, to recognize the achievements of players, coaches, and personnel who dedicated their careers to the league.

<text>L&#x27;Avventura () is a 1960 drama film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. Developed from a story by Antonioni with co-writers Elio Bartolini and Tonino Guerra, the film is about the disappearance of a young woman (Lea Massari) during a boating trip in the Mediterranean, and the subsequent search for her by her lover (Gabriele Ferzetti) and her best friend (Monica Vitti). It was filmed on location in Rome, the Aeolian Islands, and Sicily in 1959 under difficult financial and physical conditions. The film is noted for its unusual pacing, which emphasizes visual composition, mood, and character over traditional narrative development.

&quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; was nominated for numerous awards and was awarded the Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. The film made Vitti an international star. According to an Antonioni obituary, the film &quot;systematically subverted the filmic codes, practices and structures in currency at its time&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; is the first film of a trilogy by Antonioni, followed by &quot;La Notte&quot; (1961) and &quot;L&#x27;Eclisse&quot; (1962). It has appeared on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s list of the critics&#x27; top ten greatest films ever made three times in a row: It was voted second in 1962, fifth in 1972 and seventh in 1982. In 2010, it was ranked number 40 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. The film would go on to influence several arthouse directors, including Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Jia Zhangke, and Hirokazu Kore-eda.

==Plot==

Three wealthy Italians—Anna, her boyfriend Sandro, and her friend Claudia—plan a Mediterranean yacht trip to celebrate Sandro&#x27;s return from a long business trip. Before leaving, Anna visits her father, who senses that her relationship with Sandro is not going well. When Anna meets Sandro in Rome, the reunion is distant and awkward. Even so, the two eventually make love in his house while Claudia waits.

Sandro drives the two women to the coast, where they join the other members of their voyage, two affluent couples who also have difficult relationships. The next day, the group reaches the Aeolian Islands, and Anna jumps into the water for a swim. Sandro follows her when she claims to have seen a shark, only to discover later that it was a lie. The group tours a desolate island with steep cliffs. Anna tells Sandro that she is unhappy with his frequent business trips, but he dismisses her concerns and takes a nap on the rocks.

Anna goes missing. Sandro brushes it off as typical behavior, but when she fails to reappear, the group searches the island for her, to no avail. Sandro, Corrado and Claudia stay behind to continue the search, while the others notify the authorities. Claudia suggests to Sandro that his neglect may have played a role in Anna&#x27;s disappearance, offending Sandro. The police and Anna&#x27;s father arrive, but they cannot find Anna either.

Claudia and Sandro split up to continue the search. Sandro decides to investigate local smugglers, while Claudia decides to search the remaining islands alone. They agree to meet up later in Palermo, but Sandro startles Claudia by kissing her before leaving. The smugglers have no information about Anna&#x27;s disappearance.

Sandro and Claudia meet at the train station. Their mutual attraction is evident. To avoid Sandro, Claudia boards a train to Palermo and asks him to stay behind. Sandro considers it, but boards the train anyway. Claudia is annoyed, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing their attraction. Claudia is troubled by how easily things can change. Sandro relents and gets off the train at Castroreale.

In Messina, Sandro meets with journalist Zuria, who suggests Anna may have been seen by a chemist in Troina. Sandro heads for Troina, but not before bribing Zuria to print the story in the newspaper. Meanwhile, Claudia arrives at Corrado&#x27;s villa, where no one takes Anna&#x27;s disappearance seriously. She reads Zuria&#x27;s story and travels to Troina, where she runs into Sandro. They agree to continue the search together.

Sandro and Claudia interview the chemist Zuria mentioned, who claims to have sold tranquilizers to Anna. They learn that the woman left for Noto in southern Sicily. Together, they drive south. They stop at a deserted village and make love on a hill overlooking the town. In Noto, they search for Anna at the Trinacria Hotel, but find nothing. Their increasing ennui is briefly interrupted when they ring bells at a local church, but the moment passes. While passing the time, Sandro casually ruins a local artist&#x27;s drawing; the artist thinks he did it intentionally.

Claudia remains conflicted between her feelings for Sandro and her loyalty to Anna. Even so, when Sandro hesitates to tell her he loves her, Claudia is disappointed. Eventually, the two tell each other they are in love. At the Chiesa del Collegio, Sandro reveals his disappointment with his career and proposes to Claudia, but she declines. The next morning, Sandro and Claudia both seem to be passionately in love, but Claudia resists his advances and suggests they leave.

In Taormina, Sandro and Claudia stay at the San Domenico Palace Hotel while Sandro&#x27;s boss and his wife prepare for a party. Claudia decides to skip it, while Sandro checks out the women and recognizes Gloria Perkins, a beautiful 19-year-old &quot;writer&quot; and aspiring actress who is actually a high-end prostitute. Later, Claudia searches for Sandro. She visits Sandro&#x27;s boss&#x27; hotel room, but Sandro is not there. She confides in the boss&#x27; wife that she is scared that Anna has reappeared and retaken Sandro. She questions why she would feel relieved for her friend to be dead.

Claudia eventually finds Sandro in a compromising position with Gloria. Heartbroken, Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her to the hotel terrace, which has a view of a bombed-out church. Both of them are crying. Claudia considers whether to extend a comforting hand to Sandro. After some thought, she places her hand on Sandro&#x27;s head. They enigmatically gaze at Mount Etna in the distance.

===Shooting===
Shooting began in August 1959 and lasted until 15 January 1960. Antonioni began filming the island sequence with the scenes immediately after Anna disappears. The majority of shooting on the island was filmed on the island Lisca Bianca (&quot;white fish bone&quot;) with a cast and crew of 50 people. Other locations for the island sequence included Panarea (which was the production&#x27;s headquarters), Mondello and Palermo. Filming the island sequence was intended to take three weeks, but ended up lasting for four months. Difficulties included the islands being infested with rats, mosquitoes and reptiles; also, the weather was unexpectedly cold, and the navy ship hired to transport the cast and crew to the island every day never appeared. In order to carry personal items and equipment to the island, the crew had to build small rafts out of empty gas canisters and wooden planks; these were towed by a launching tug every morning.

One week after shooting began, the film&#x27;s production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies of food and water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and managed to get the cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca, and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually, the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his assistant director shot the film themselves. Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he &quot;woke up every morning at 3 o&#x27;clock in order to be alone and reflect on what I was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all&quot;. After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.

Whilst shooting on the 40-foot yacht for scenes early in the film, the cast and crew totaled 23 people. Antonioni had wanted to shoot the film chronologically, but the yacht was not available until November. Owing to the cold weather, actress Lea Massari developed a cardiac condition after spending several days swimming in the Mediterranean Sea during filming, and spent several days in a coma after being rushed to Rome for medical treatment.

After completing the island sequence, filming continued throughout Sicily and Italy. The sequence on the train from Castroreale to Cefalù took two days to shoot instead of the intended three hours. The scene in Messina where Sandro encounters Gloria Perkins took two days to shoot; Antonioni initially wanted 400 extras for it. Only 100 turned up, so crew members recruited passers-by on the street to appear in the scene. The sequence where Sandro and Claudia visit a deserted town was shot in Santa Panagia, near Catania in Sicily; buildings there were commissioned by Benito Mussolini, and were examples of fascist architecture of the &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot;. The scene where Sandro and Claudia first have sex took 10 days to shoot, owing to the crew having to wait for a train to pass by every morning.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Giovanni Fusco, who had scored all of Antonioni&#x27;s films up to that time. Antonioni usually only used diegetic music in his films and this was one of the latter times that he (briefly) included a musical score for scenes other than during the credits. For &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot;, Antonioni asked Fusco to compose &quot;jazz as though it had been written in the Hellenic era&quot;.

===Production notes===
* Antonioni wrote that the film was &quot;expressed through images in which I hope to show not the birth of an erroneous sentiment, but rather the way in which we go astray in our sentiments. Because as I have said, our moral values are old. Our myths and conventions are old. And everyone knows that they are indeed old and outmoded. Yet we respect them&quot;.
* Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, American International Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. refused the US distribution rights, so Antonioni sold the project to Columbia Pictures.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; grossed 340 million lire in Italy during its initial release in Italy.

===Critical response===
Despite the film&#x27;s eventual lionization by film scholars, the film received a harsh reception at its opening in May at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. It is one of the festival&#x27;s more notorious reactions. According to Vitti, the screening of Cannes was a real-life drama. From the opening titles, despite the film&#x27;s serious tone, laughs erupted in a dark theater packed with critics and photographers. Laughs continued through the runtime, joined by boos. Gene Youngblood said that audience members usually booed during long sequences where nothing happened to further the film&#x27;s plot, but has asserted that &quot;quite a lot is happening in these scenes&quot;. Antonioni and Vitti, who claimed she was sobbing, fled the theater.

The next day, however, the filmmakers were sent a list of signatures from established filmmakers and writers who declared that &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; was the best film screened at Cannes. After a second screening, the film went on to win the Jury Prize at the same festival, and went on to international box office success and what has been described as &quot;hysteria&quot;. Youngblood described the trilogy of which &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; is the first component as a &quot;unified statement about the malady of the emotional life in contemporary times&quot;.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;weird adventure&quot; and praised its cinematography and performances. Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it the movie-going phenomenon of 1961, and praised Antonioni&#x27;s depiction of characters that cannot communicate with each other. Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that &quot;Antonioni is trying to exploit the unique powers of the film as distinct from the theater. ... He attempts to get from film the same utility of the medium itself as a novelist whose point is not story but mood and character and for whom the texture of the prose works as much as what he says in the prose&quot;.

Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker&quot;.

Alexander Walker judged it the best film ever made.

===Accolades===
===Home media===
A digitally restored version of the film (optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer edition) was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection (under license of Columbia TriStar) in June 2001. The release includes audio commentary by film historian Gene Youngblood, an English subtitle translation, a 58-minute documentary by Gianfranco Mingozzi titled &quot;Antonioni: Documents and Testimonials&quot; (1966), and writings by Antonioni read by Jack Nicholson with Nicholson&#x27;s personal recollections of the director.

==Legacy==
&quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; influenced the visual language of cinema, changing how subsequent films looked, and has been named by some critics as one of the best ever made. However, it has been criticized by others for its seemingly uneventful plot and slow pacing, along with the existentialist themes. Youngblood wrote that &quot;very few films in the history of cinema have broken the standard rules of cinematic grammar so elegantly, so subtly, as this film&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum has called it a masterpiece. Roger Ebert wrote that he came to like the film later in life when he began to admire the &quot;clarity and passion Antonioni brought to the film&#x27;s silent cry of despair&quot;. Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out London&quot; criticized the film, writing that &quot;if it once seemed the ultimate in arty, intellectually chic movie-making, the film now looks all too studied and remote a portrait of emotional sterility&quot;. Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; defended the film against Andrew&#x27;s criticism, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s easy to bash Antonioni as passe. It&#x27;s harder, I think, to explain the cinematic power of the way his camera watches, and waits, while the people on screen stave off a dreadful loneliness&quot;.

It has appeared on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s list of the critics&#x27; top 10 greatest films ever made three times in a row: it was voted second in 1962, fifth in 1972 and seventh in 1982. In 2012, it ranked number 21 (with 43 votes) in the critics&#x27; poll and number 30 (14 votes) in the directors&#x27; poll. In 2010, it was ranked number 40 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. The film was included on BBC Culture&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films ranked by 209 film critics from 43 countries around the world.

==Meaning==
Much has been made of Anna&#x27;s unsolved disappearance, which Roger Ebert has described as being linked to the film&#x27;s mostly wealthy, bored, and spoiled characters, none of whom have fulfilling relationships. They are all, according to Ebert, &quot;on the brink of disappearance&quot;.

According to Alain Robbe-Grillet, many shots in the &quot;continental&quot; part of the film are taken from the point of view of an unseen character, as if Anna was following Sandro and Claudia to see what they would do. When asked, Antonioni told Robbe-Grillet that the &quot;missing&quot; scene (showing Anna&#x27;s body recovered from the sea) was scripted and actually filmed but did not make it into the final cut, apparently for timing reasons.

<doc id="330877" wikidata="Q260442" url="?curid=330877" title="Chewbacca defense">
<text>In a jury trial, the Chewbacca defense is a legal strategy in which a criminal defense lawyer tries to confuse the jury rather than refute the case of the prosecutor. It is an intentional distraction or obfuscation. As a Chewbacca defense distracts and misleads, it is an example of a red herring. It is also an example of an irrelevant conclusion, a type of informal fallacy in which one making an argument fails to address the issue in question. Often an opposing counsel can legally object to such arguments by declaring them irrelevant, character evidence, or argumentative.

The name &quot;Chewbacca defense&quot; comes from &quot;Chef Aid&quot;, an episode of the American animated series &quot;South Park&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;South_10/7/1998&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The episode, which premiered on October 7, 1998, satirizes the O. J. Simpson murder trial, particularly attorney Johnnie Cochran&#x27;s closing argument for the defense. In the episode, a fictionalized version of Cochran bases his argument on a false premise about the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. He asks the jury why a Wookiee like Chewbacca would want to live on Endor with the much smaller Ewoks when &quot;it does not make sense&quot;. He argues that if Chewbacca living on Endor does not make sense—and if even mentioning Chewbacca in the case does not make sense—then the jury must acquit.

==Origin==
In the episode, the character of Chef contacts a &quot;major record company&quot; executive, seeking to have his name credited as the composer of a fictional Alanis Morissette hit called &quot;Stinky Britches&quot;. Chef&#x27;s claim is substantiated by a 20‑year-old recording of Chef performing the song. The record company refuses and hires Johnnie Cochran, who files a lawsuit against Chef for harassment. In court, Cochran resorts to his &quot;famous&quot; Chewbacca defense, which he &quot;used during the Simpson trial&quot;, according to Chef&#x27;s lawyer, Gerald Broflovski. Although Broflovski uses logic, reasoning, and the fact that Chef properly copyrighted his work, Cochran counters with the following:

This statement is a parody of Cochran&#x27;s closing arguments in the O. J. Simpson murder case, where he said to the jury, &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit&quot;, in reference to a courtroom demonstration in which Simpson appeared unable to fit a pair of bloody leather gloves found at the murder scene over the medical gloves he was wearing.

In a June 28, 1995 memo to Cochran, Gerald Uelmen came up with (and Cochran later repeated) a quip he used in his closing arguments, &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit.&quot; In his memo to Cochran, Uelmen noted that the phrase not only applied to the gloves, but to the evidence presented by the prosecutors:&lt;ref name=&quot;LaRoe_4/5/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the episode, Cochran&#x27;s defense is successful. The jury finds Chef guilty of &quot;harassing a major record label&quot;, after which the judge sets his punishment as either a $2 million fine to be paid within 24 hours or, failing that, four years in prison (the judge initially sentences him to eight million years before being corrected by a court officer). Ultimately, a &quot;Chef Aid&quot; benefit concert is organized to raise money for Chef to hire Cochran for his own lawsuit against the record company. At the concert, Cochran has a change of heart and offers to represent Chef &quot;pro bono.&quot; He again successfully uses the Chewbacca defense, this time to defeat the record company and force them to acknowledge Chef&#x27;s authorship of their song. In the second use of the Chewbacca defense, he ends by taking out a monkey puppet and shouting, &quot;Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey!&quot; causing a juror&#x27;s head to explode.

==Use==
The Associated Press obituary for Cochran mentioned the Chewbacca defense parody as one of the ways in which the attorney had entered pop culture. Criminologist Thomas O&#x27;Connor says that when DNA evidence shows &quot;inclusion&quot;, that is, does not exonerate a client by exclusion from the DNA sample provided, &quot;About the only thing you can do is attack the lab for its (lack of) quality assurance and proficiency testing, or use a &#x27;Chewbacca defense&#x27; … and try to razzle-dazzle the jury about how complex and complicated the other side&#x27;s evidence or probability estimates are.&quot; Forensic scientist Erin Kenneally has argued that court challenges to digital evidence frequently use the Chewbacca defense by presenting multiple alternative explanations of forensic evidence obtained from computers and Internet providers to confuse the jury into reasonable doubt. Kenneally also provides methods that can be used to rebut a Chewbacca defense. Kenneally and colleague Anjali Swienton have presented this topic before the Florida State Court System and at the 2005 American Academy of Forensic Sciences annual meeting.

The term has seen use in political commentary. Ellis Weiner wrote in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in January 2007 that right-wing commentator Dinesh D&#x27;Souza was using the Chewbacca defense in criticism of then new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, defining it as when &quot;someone asserts his claim by saying something so patently nonsensical that the listener&#x27;s brain shuts down completely&quot;. Jay Heinrichs&#x27; book &quot;Thank You for Arguing&quot; states that the term &quot;Chewbacca defense&quot; is &quot;sneaking into the lexicon&quot; as another name for the red herring fallacy. The term was used by Paul Krugman, who wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that John Taylor uses the Chewbacca defense as a seemingly last option for defending his hawkish monetary policy position, after years of publicly stating that &quot;quantitative easing would lead to a major acceleration of inflation.&quot;

==Analysis by lawyers==
Lawyer Josh Gilliland states in his blog, &quot;A judge likely would say, &#x27;I have a bad feeling about this&#x27; and possibly declare a mistrial if such an argument was made in court.&quot; Gilliland continued, &quot;A party successfully using the Chewbacca Defense to confuse the jury into engaging in jury nullification in a civil lawsuit runs the risk of the losing party winning on a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). In Chef&#x27;s case, the copyright violation should have entitled him to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot; Lawyer Devin Stone outlined all the things that he stated would never happen in a real case, giving the episode a &quot;C-&quot; for legal accuracy.

<text>Anthropometry (, ) refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of physical anthropology, it has been used for identification, for the purposes of understanding human physical variation, in paleoanthropology and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body, primarily dimensional descriptors of body size and shape. Since commonly used methods and approaches in analysing living standards were not helpful enough, the anthropometric history became very useful for historians in answering questions that interested them. 

Today, anthropometry plays an important role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the rise in obesity) and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections.

== History ==

The history of anthropometry includes and spans various concepts, both scientific and pseudoscientific, such as craniometry, paleoanthropology, biological anthropology, phrenology, physiognomy, forensics, criminology, phylogeography, human origins, and cranio-facial description, as well as correlations between various anthropometrics and personal identity, mental typology, personality, cranial vault and brain size, and other factors.

At various times in history, applications of anthropometry have ranged from accurate scientific description and epidemiological analysis to rationales for eugenics and overtly racist social movements. One of its misuses was the discredited pseudoscience, phrenology.

==Individual variation==

===Auxologic===

Auxologic is a broad term covering the study of all aspects of human physical growth.

====Height====

Human height varies greatly between individuals and across populations for a variety of complex biological, genetic, and environmental factors, among others. Due to methodological and practical problems, its measurement is also subject to considerable error in statistical sampling.

The average height in genetically and environmentally homogeneous populations is often proportional across a large number of individuals. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from a population&#x27;s average) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities. It is important to note that a great degree of variation occurs between even the most &#x27;common&#x27; bodies (66% of the population), and as such no person can be considered &#x27;average&#x27;.

In the most extreme population comparisons, for example, the average female height in Bolivia is while the average male height in the Dinaric Alps is , an average difference of . Similarly, the shortest and tallest of individuals, Chandra Bahadur Dangi and Robert Wadlow, have ranged from , respectively.

The age range where most females stop growing is 15–⁠18 years and the age range where most males stop growing is 18–⁠21 years.

====Weight====

Human weight varies extensively both individually and across populations, with the most extreme documented examples of adults being Lucia Zarate who weighed , and Jon Brower Minnoch who weighed , and with population extremes ranging from in Bangladesh to in Micronesia.

====Organs====
Adult brain size varies from to in females and to in males, with the average being and , respectively. The right cerebral hemisphere is typically larger than the left, whereas the cerebellar hemispheres are typically of more similar size.

Size of the human stomach varies significantly in adults, with one study showing volumes ranging from to and weights ranging from to .

Male and female genitalia exhibit considerable individual variation, with penis size differing substantially and vaginal size differing significantly in healthy adults.

===Aesthetic===

Human beauty and physical attractiveness have been preoccupations throughout history which often intersect with anthropometric standards. Cosmetology, facial symmetry, and waist–hip ratio are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental.

==Evolutionary science==
Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following Bergmann&#x27;s rule, which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and Allen&#x27;s rule, which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.

On a microevolutionary level, anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance, John Relethford&#x27;s studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago.

Similarly, anthropometric indices, namely comparison of the human stature was used to illustrate anthropometric trends. This study was conducted by Jörg Baten and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that human height is predetermined by the quality of the nutrition, which used to be higher in the more developed countries. The research was based on the datasets for Southern Chinese contract migrants who were sent to Suriname and Indonesia and included 13,000 individuals.

==Measuring instruments==

===3D body scanners===
Today anthropometry can be performed with three-dimensional scanners. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether the Body Volume Index has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK&#x27;s pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women&#x27;s survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65 kg. However, recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken, the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for industry tolerances, and measurements taken may or may not be relevant to all applications (e.g. garment construction). Despite these current limitations, 3D Body Scanning has been suggested as a replacement for body measurement prediction technologies which (despite the great appeal) have yet to be as reliable as real human data.

===Baropodographic===
Baropodographic devices fall into two main categories: (i) floor-based, and (ii) in-shoe. The underlying technology is diverse, ranging from piezoelectric sensor arrays to light refraction, but the ultimate form of the data generated by all modern technologies is either a 2D image or a 2D image time series of the pressures acting under the plantar surface of the foot. From these data other variables may be calculated (see &quot;data analysis.&quot;)

The spatial and temporal resolutions of the images generated by commercial pedobarographic systems range from approximately 3 to 10 mm and 25 to 500 Hz, respectively. Sensor technology limits finer resolution. Such resolutions yield a contact area of approximately 500 sensors (for a typical adult human foot with surface area of approximately 100 cm2). For a stance phase duration of approximately 0.6 seconds during normal walking, approximately 150,000 pressure values, depending on the hardware specifications, are recorded for each step.

===Neuroimaging===

Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as MRI, which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on neuroscience and intelligence. Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology.

==Epidemiology and medical anthropology==
Anthropometric measurements also have uses in epidemiology and medical anthropology, for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes. Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose malnutrition in resource-poor clinical settings.

==Forensics and criminology==

Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile. Forensic anthropologists utilize the Fordisc program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry determination.

One part of a biological profile is a person&#x27;s ancestral affinity. People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have little to no prognathism; a relatively long and narrow face; a prominent brow ridge that protrudes forward from the forehead; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a &quot;silled&quot; nasal aperture; tower-shaped nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape. Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among those of particular ancestries: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into an ancestral group.

==Ergonomics==

Ergonomics professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity. This includes physical ergonomics in relation to human anatomy, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics; cognitive ergonomics in relation to perception, memory, reasoning, motor response including human–computer interaction, mental workloads, decision making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress, training, and user experiences; organizational ergonomics in relation to metrics of communication, crew resource management, work design, schedules, teamwork, participation, community, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual organizations, and telework; environmental ergonomics in relation to human metrics affected by climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, and light; visual ergonomics; and others.

==Biometrics==


Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance. Biometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Subclasses include dermatoglyphics and soft biometrics.

==United States military research==
The US Military has conducted over 40 anthropometric surveys of U.S. Military personnel between 1945 and 1988, including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) of men and women with its 240 measures. Statistical data from these surveys encompasses over 75,000 individuals.

== Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project ==
CAESAR began in 1997 as a partnership between government (represented by the US Air Force and NATO) and industry (represented by SAE International) to collect and organize the most extensive sampling of consumer body measurements for comparison.

The project collected and organized data on 2,400 U.S. &amp; Canadian and 2,000 European civilians and a database was developed. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women, aged 18–65, of various weights, ethnic groups, gender, geographic regions, and socio-economic status. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose, full-coverage pose and relaxed seating pose.

Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated. High-resolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures, anthropometers, and other similar instruments. It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Manufacturing (CAM) tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer, making it easier to standardize. Automatic landmark recognition (ALR) technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject. More than 100 univariate measures were provided, over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements.

Demographic data such as age, ethnic group, gender, geographic region, education level, and present occupation, family income and more were also captured.

==Fashion design==
Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. For just one instance, measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of footwear: measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly (e.g. the Brannock Device) or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture (e.g. ALINEr).

<text>Edwin Oldfather Reischauer ( ; October 15, 1910 – September 1, 1990) was an American diplomat, educator, and professor at Harvard University. Born in Tokyo to American educational missionaries, he became a leading scholar of the history and culture of Japan and East Asia. Together with George M. McCune, a scholar of Korea, in 1939 he developed the McCune–Reischauer romanization of the Korean language.

Reischauer became involved in helping create US policy toward East Asia during and after World War II. President John F. Kennedy appointed Reischauer as the United States Ambassador to Japan, where he served from 1961 to 1966. Reischauer founded the Japan Institute at Harvard University in 1973 and was its founding director. It was later named in honor of him.

==Early life and education==
Reischauer was born in Tokyo, Japan, the son of Helen Sidwell (Oldfather) and August Karl Reischauer, Presbyterian educational missionaries. His father helped found the Tokyo Woman&#x27;s Christian University along with Nitobe Inazō and Yasui Tetsu. His mother founded the Japan Deaf Oral School, the first of its kind in Japan. He and his younger brother Robert attended the American School in Japan before going to the United States for college. Both did graduate work in Asian studies. Edwin graduated with a AB from Oberlin in 1931. On his 75th birthday, Reischauer recalled publicly that his aim in life after graduating in 1931 was to draw American attention to Asia.

Reischauer earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1939. He was a student of the Russian-French Japanologist Serge Elisséeff, who had been the first Western graduate of the University of Tokyo. His doctoral dissertation was &quot;&quot;Nittō guhō junrei gyōki&quot;: Ennin&#x27;s Diary of His Travels in T&#x27;ang China, 838–847,&quot; a study and translation of the Japanese monk Ennin&#x27;s travelogues on his journeys in China during the Tang dynasty. Ennin&#x27;s work, &quot;Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law&quot; (; Middle Chinese: &quot;Nyip-Dang gjuw-pjop zwin-léi hæng-kì&quot;), is written in Classical Chinese. Reischauer&#x27;s work shows the high level of Sinological scholarship that a graduate student was expected to demonstrate.

==Wartime service==
By October 1940, Reischauer had become aware of the possibility of war with Japan. He wrote a memorandum for the U.S. Navy pointing out that very few Americans knew the kind of written Japanese that was used in military situations and hardly any could read Japanese that had been handwritten in a hurry. His solution was to create a Japanese language school to train linguists in advance. Reischauer&#x27;s warning did not go unheeded. It landed on the desk of Lieutenant (later Commander) Albert Hindmarsh of the U.S. Navy, and he agreed that there were indeed few competent Japanese-speaking officers available. The result was the creation of the U.S. Navy Japanese Language School, which spent most of the war at Boulder, Colorado. In the summer of 1942, at the request of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Reischauer started running a top-secret course at Arlington Hall in Virginia. Arlington Hall had been a women&#x27;s college, but it was taken over by the US Army Signal Intelligence Service in June 1942 and functioned like Bletchley Park in England as a secret cryptanalysis centre.

==Teaching career==
Reischauer had a 40-year teaching career at Harvard. He and John King Fairbank developed a popular undergraduate survey of East Asian history and culture. The course, which was known as &quot;Rice Paddies&quot;, was the basis for their widely influential textbooks, &quot;East Asia: The Great Tradition&quot; (1958) and &quot;East Asia: The Modern Transformation&quot; (1965). Reischauer wrote both for fellow scholars and for the general public, including &quot;Japan: Story of a Nation&quot;, which was published in several editions.

He served as director of the Harvard–Yenching Institute and chairman of the Department of Far Eastern Languages. For his farewell lecture at the Yenching Institute in 1981, students had to compete for seats with faculty colleagues, university officials, and a television crew from Japan.

In that crowded scene, he said, &quot;As I remember, there were only two graduate students interested in East Asian studies when I first came here: myself and my brother.&quot;

==Ambassador to Japan==

Reischauer was appointed US Ambassador to Japan by President John F. Kennedy in the spring of 1961, at a time when US-Japan relations were at a low point following the massive 1960 protests in Japan against the US-Japan Security Treaty. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, Reischauer had traveled to Japan and spoken with various Japanese friends and associates to get a Japanese point of view on the protests. After returning to the United States, Reischauer attracted the attention of Kennedy&#x27;s transition team when he wrote an article about the protests in the prominent policy journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; called &quot;The Broken Dialogue with Japan.&quot; In this article Reischauer rejected the notion, put forth by the Eisenhower administration, that the protests had been a communist plot. Instead, he argued that the protests reflected real grievances on the part of the Japanese in relation to US, and were exacerbated by a failure by American leaders to reach out to Japanese opinion leaders and try to understand Japanese concerns. Reischauer argued forcefully that only skillful and nuanced diplomacy could repair this &quot;broken dialogue.&quot;

On the advice of his advisors, Kennedy decided that Reischauer himself would be the best candidate for the job, and nominated Reischauer to be his first (and only) ambassador to Japan. This was a break with precedent, because previous ambassadors to Japan had been career State Department officials who had no special connection with Japan. In fact, State Department officials viewed strong connections with an ambassador&#x27;s host country with suspicion and opposed Reischauer&#x27;s nomination on these grounds. However, Kennedy prevailed and Reischauer became the first US ambassador to Japan who actually knew the local language.

As Ambassador, Reischauer worked to repair the recent rift in US-Japan relations. Reischauer made &quot;equal partnership&quot; the watchword of his time as ambassador, and constantly pushed for more equal treatment of Japan. He advocated and helped arrange a summit meeting between Kennedy and new Japanese prime minister Hayato Ikeda in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1961. Historian Nick Kapur has argued that this summit was a success, and led to a substantial realignment of the US-Japan alliance in the direction of greater mutuality. Reischauer hoped to return the favor by having Kennedy become the first sitting US president to visit Japan. Kennedy was agreeable, and initial preparations were made, but Kennedy was assassinated before he could make the visit and Secretary of State Dean Rusk went in his place in early 1964. Reischauer also embarked on a nationwide listening tour in Japan; although he did not reach his goal of visiting all 47 prefectures by the end of his time in office, he did manage to visit 39 of them. Reischauer&#x27;s great efforts to charm the Japanese people were jocularly nicknamed the &quot;Reischauer Offensive&quot; (&quot;Raishawā rosen&quot;) by the Japanese press (sometimes alternatively, the &quot;Kennedy-Reischauer Offensive&quot;).

Reischauer&#x27;s time as ambassador was seen as a success, and he stayed in the role until 1966, continuing on under the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. However, his time as ambassador ended on two notes of tragedy. Toward the end of his ambassadorship, Reischauer increasingly had to defend the US war in Vietnam, and increasingly felt uncomfortable doing so, ultimately leading to his resignation. In addition, Reischauer was hospitalized in March 1964 after being stabbed by Shiotani Norikazu, a Japanese youth, in an apparent assassination attempt. Shiotani had a history of mental illness and had Ménière&#x27;s disease, a disorder of the inner ear. He felt that he had not been properly treated by the American occupation and wished to draw attention to this cause by assassinating Reischauer. The attacker apparently acted alone and had no connection to any group. In the aftermath of the violence, Japan&#x27;s Minister of Public Safety was compelled to resign. Reischauer received a blood transfusion and recovered from his wound, but the transfusion he received in the hospital was tainted with hepatitis C virus, which would lead to a variety of ailments for Reischauer in future years, and ultimately contribute to his death 26 years later.

==Personal life==
Reischauer married (Elinor) Adrienne Danton in Tokyo on July 5, 1935. They had three children together. She died in 1955 of a heart ailment. Author James A. Michener introduced the widower to Haru Matsukata at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Tokyo in 1955. They married on January 16, 1956. They learned that, as teenagers, they had attended the same Tokyo high school. Haru confessed to having had a secret crush on him. Together they became a formidable team. They jointly designed their house in Belmont, Massachusetts. It is operated and used today as the Edwin O. Reischauer Memorial House.

==Later life==
In 1973, Reischauer was the founding Director of the Japan Institute at Harvard University. It was renamed the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies in his honor when he turned 75, in 1985.

Reischauer was also honored in 1985 by the opening of the Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), part of Johns Hopkins University. Speaking at the dedication ceremonies in Baltimore, Senator Jay Rockefeller, one of Reischauer&#x27;s former students, described Reischauer as being &quot;what a teacher is meant to be, one who can change the life of his students.&quot; At the same event, Japan&#x27;s ambassador, Nabuo Matsunaga, read a personal message from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone: &quot;I know of no other man who has so thoroughly understood Japan.&quot;

==Illness and death==
For the last decade of his life, Reischauer was afflicted by a variety of ailments and illnesses related to the hepatitis infection he had contracted from tainted blood following the attempt on his life while serving as US Ambassador to Japan. As a result of these ailments, Reischauer had to withdraw from active teaching and lecturing. Finally, in 1990, Reischauer succumbed to complications of hepatitis C.

==Impact on US foreign policy==
Reischauer promoted US foreign policy both in public and in government on Japan and the rest of Asia after World War II and during the Vietnam War.

===World War II and afterward===
On September 14, 1942, three years before the end of World War II, Reischauer, then an instructor in Far Eastern languages at Harvard University, wrote the &quot;Memorandum on Policy towards Japan.&quot; It laid out a plan on how the US could attain its postwar objective of &quot;winning the peace&quot; in Asia.

According to late 20th-century Japanese historian Takashi Fujitani, the memo revealed a &quot;condescension toward Japanese people&quot; and a &quot;purely instrumentalist and manipulative stance.&quot; In the abstract to his article, &quot;The Reischauer Memo: Mr. Moto, Hirohito, and Japanese American Soldiers,&quot; Fujitani wrote:
===Myth of saving Kyoto===
During the war, Reischauer served as a Japan expert for the US Army Intelligence Service. A myth developed after the war that he had prevented the US from a nuclear bombing of Kyoto. Robert Jungk, in his memoir about the war and atomic scientists, claimed that Reischauer convinced his boss to persuade Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson not to bomb Kyoto, and to have it crossed off the black list of potential sites.

Reischauer specifically denied that popular myth:
===US bases in Okinawa===
A secret memorandum, declassified in 1996, detailed a conversation among top US military and civilian officials on July 16, 1965, in Tokyo. Reischauer, then serving as the US Ambassador to Japan, proposed a plan to enable the US both to keep its military bases and to introduce nuclear weapons in Okinawa after the reversion of the US-occupied islands to Japanese sovereignty. Reischauer based his strategy on the symbolic political importance of reversion for Japan&#x27;s conservative ruling party, but argued that the US did not have to &quot;give Japan any real say in the use of our bases.&quot;

He said that &quot;if Japan would accept nuclear weapons on Japanese soil, including Okinawa, and if it would provide us with assurances guaranteeing our military commanders effective control of the islands in time of military crisis, then we would be able to keep our bases on the islands, even though &#x27;full sovereignty&#x27; reverted to Japan.&quot;

These &quot;became key elements [of] the 1969 U.S.-Japan Okinawa Reversion Agreement,&quot; effectively making &quot;U.S. military presence more or less permanent and maintaining the option to introduce nuclear weapons.&quot; In a 1981 article, &quot;Time&quot; reported: &quot;Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer revealed that ...U.S. naval vessels carrying nuclear weapons have routinely visited Japanese ports—with Tokyo&#x27;s tacit approval.&quot;

The secret memo also revealed Reischauer&#x27;s proposed countermeasures to quell &quot;nationalistic reaction&quot; to continuing US military presence in Okinawa. In his 2010 article, &quot;&#x27;Secret&#x27; 1965 Memo Reveals Plans to Keep U.S. bases and Nuclear Weapons Options in Okinawa After Reversion,&quot; Steve Rabson, author and lecturer on Okinawan literature, history, and culture, wrote:
==Romanization of Korean==
With George M. McCune, Reischauer in 1939 published the McCune–Reischauer system for romanization of the Korean language, which became the most-widely used system for many years.

Reischauer called Hangul, the Korean alphabet, &quot;perhaps the most scientific system of writing in general use in any language.&quot;

<text>George McAfee &quot;Mac&quot; McCune ( ; June 16, 1908 – November 5, 1948) was an American scholar of Korea who developed the McCune–Reischauer romanization system of Korean with Edwin O. Reischauer. He taught Korean history and language at Occidental College and the University of California, Berkeley.

==Early life and education==
Born in Pyongyang, Korea, George McAfee McCune was the son of Helen McAfee and George Shannon McCune, American Presbyterian educational missionaries who had sailed to the country in 1905. Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910.

The McCunes worked in Pyongyang and Sinch&#x27;ŏn. The young George had a younger brother, Shannon, and two sisters, Catherine and Margaret. They received their elementary educations in Korea.

McCune moved to the United States to attend Huron College in South Dakota, where his father was president, and after a year transferred to Rutgers University in New Jersey. He graduated from Occidental College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1930. McCune returned to Korea for a few years, and taught at Union Christian College in Pyongyang, where his parents were working. He also owned and managed Taeon, a formerly Chinese-owned business, which enabled him to finance his graduate education.

McCune returned to the US and completed his MA at Occidental College in 1935. He started doctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley. He was granted a Mills Traveling Fellowship to continue his studies in Korea. He spent a year working on the official Yi dynasty chronicles in connection with his dissertation. In 1941, he received his PhD from Berkeley.

In 1939, he and Edwin O. Reischauer, also an East Asian scholar, published their McCune-Reischauer romanization of the Korean language, which was widely used for decades.

==Marriage and family==

He married Evelyn Margaret Becker (1907-2012) in Honolulu, Hawaii, on April 22, 1933. She was a child of American Methodist missionary parents and also had been born in Pyongyang. They had met there while both were visiting their respective families. She was teaching at the Seoul Foreign School in Seoul, Korea, after getting her BA at University of California, Berkeley.

They became engaged and then married during a crisis because of McCune&#x27;s health problems; his heart had been weakened by the rheumatic fever that he suffered from as a child.

==Career==
McCune began teaching Korean language and history at Occidental College, where he taught from 1939 to 1946, advancing from the rank of Instructor to Associate Professor.

Soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered World War II. In 1942, McCune was given a leave of absence to serve the war effort. He worked as a Social Science Analyst in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After serving in the OSS for two years and briefly on the Board of Economic Warfare, McCune was appointed as officer of the Korea Desk in the State Department. During those years, he was &quot;generally recognized as the government&#x27;s leading expert on Korean affairs.&quot;

In 1946, he began teaching at UC, Berkeley. In 1948, he was promoted to associate professor of history at Berkeley, but he died that year because of heart problems.

At Berkeley, he had helped establish an intensive course in the Korean language in the Far Eastern and Russian Language School of the University Extension. In addition, he acquired for the East Asiatic Library several hundred volumes in the Korean language: &quot;These constitute one of the first such collections in this country.&quot;

&quot;He was a member of the Far Eastern Association, the Foreign Policy Association, the American Historical Association, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Institute of Pacific Relations, the American Association of University Professors and the World Affairs Institute. In 1947 he was appointed a member of the Advisory Editorial Board of the &quot;Far Eastern Quarterly&quot; and in the same year was a delegate to the National Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations, at Coronado, California.&quot;

His brother, Shannon Boyd-Bailey McCune (1913–1993), became a geographer and wrote several books about Korea for the general public.

<text>Carbamoyl phosphate is an anion of biochemical significance. In land-dwelling animals, it is an intermediary metabolite in nitrogen disposal through the urea cycle and the synthesis of pyrimidines. Its enzymatic counterpart, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I), interacts with a class of molecules called sirtuins, NAD dependent protein deacetylases, and ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. CP then enters the urea cycle in which it reacts with ornithine (a process catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase) to form citrulline.

== Classification ==
Carbamoyl phosphate is a metabolic intermediate in a pathway that involves nitrogen disposal through the urea cycle and the biosynthesis of pyrimidines.

==Production==
It is produced from bicarbonate, ammonia (derived from amino acids), and phosphate (from ATP). The synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This uses three reactions as follows:

* + ATP → ADP + (carboxyl phosphate)
* + NH3 + OH− → + −O–C(O)NH2 + H2O
*−O–C(O)NH2 + ATP → ADP + 

== Clinical significance ==
A defect in the CPS I enzyme, and a subsequent deficiency in the production of carbamoyl phosphate has been linked to hyperammonemia in humans.

== See also ==
* Ornithine transcarbamylase
*Citrulline
*Urea Cycle

<text>American McGee&#x27;s Alice is a 2000 third-person dark fantasy action-adventure video game developed by Rogue Entertainment under the direction of designer American McGee and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Games banner. The game was originally released for Windows and Mac OS. Although a planned PlayStation 2 port was cancelled, the game was later released digitally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via downloadable content for .

The game&#x27;s premise is based on the Lewis Carroll novels &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871) but presents a gloomy, cruel and violent version of the setting. The game centers on the novels&#x27; protagonist Alice, whose family is killed in a house fire years before the story of the game takes place. After several years of treatment in a psychiatric clinic, the emotionally traumatized Alice makes a mental retreat to Wonderland, which has been disfigured by her injured psyche.

&quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; uses the id Tech 3 game engine, which was previously used in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and redesigned for this game by Ritual Entertainment. The game was met with positive critical reception, with reviewers commending the high artistic and technical quality of the level design while criticizing the excessive linearity of the gameplay. As of September 2017, &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; has sold over 1.5 million copies. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2011.

==Gameplay==
&quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; is a third-person action game in which the player controls the titular character Alice along a linear route. Alice can communicate with non-player characters, fight off enemies and bosses, and solve puzzles. Along with the basic actions of walking and jogging, Alice can jump, cling to ledges, climb and swing on ropes, swim in water, and glide over columns of steam by using her inflated dress as a makeshift parachute. The game can be played at four difficulty levels: &quot;Easy&quot;, Medium&quot;, &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;Nightmare&quot;. The game&#x27;s levels feature many platforms and other obstacles not based on artificial intelligence as well as puzzles that require solving for further passage through the game.

Throughout the game, Alice can obtain up to ten different weapons, known as &quot;toys&quot;, for use against enemies. Most toys have two modes of use, which differ in the method and strength of the attack. The first toy acquired by Alice is the Vorpal Blade, which, along with the Croquet Mallet, can be used for basic melee attacks. Toys with longer range include the Ice Wand and an explosive jack-in-the-box. One particular toy, the Jabberwock&#x27;s Eye Staff, is essential to the narrative and is assembled from pieces scattered throughout the setting. The game&#x27;s combat system implements automatic target designation: if an enemy character is nearby, the player&#x27;s weapon sight is automatically fixed upon that enemy. Outside of combat, the sight plays the role of a jump indicator by taking on the shape of two footprints that appear on the surface of any place that Alice would land if she made a jump.

Because the game takes place within Alice&#x27;s imagination, the health mechanic is represented as &quot;sanity&quot;, which is displayed as a red bar on the left-hand side of the screen. The sanity meter decreases when Alice sustains damage from enemy attacks or an environmental hazard. When the sanity meter is depleted, the game prematurely ends, after which it can be continued from where the game was last saved. A magic mechanic is represented as &quot;willpower&quot;, and it is displayed as a blue bar on the right-hand side of the screen. Willpower is consumed when almost any toy is used, and a toy will not serve its function when Alice&#x27;s willpower is too low. Certain amounts of sanity or willpower can be restored by collecting crystals of &quot;meta-essence&quot;, the life force of Wonderland. Crystals of &quot;meta-substance&quot;, representing the power of imagination, restore sanity and willpower simultaneously. All crystal types can be found scattered across levels and some respawn within certain places. Meta-substance can be obtained after defeating an enemy; the volume of the meta-substance is dependent on the strength of the defeated enemy.

Certain uncommon items can be found throughout the game that enhance Alice&#x27;s abilities: &quot;Ragebox Elixir&quot; increases the damage dealt by Alice with the Vorpal Blade, the &quot;Darkened Looking Glass&quot; makes Alice invisible to enemies, and &quot;Grasshopper Tea&quot; augments Alice&#x27;s speed and jumping height. These items change Alice&#x27;s appearance and their effects are limited to a short period of time, after which Alice returns to her original state.

==Plot==

In 1863, Alice Liddell is awoken from a dream of Wonderland by a house fire. Although she is able to save herself, her parents are killed and she is left with serious burns and psychological damage. Alice is brought to Rutledge Asylum in a state of catatonia, where several years of treatment fail to rouse her from her stupor. When Alice&#x27;s toy rabbit seems to call to her for help, she mentally retreats to Wonderland, which appears to have been disfigured by her broken mind. Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, who invites her to follow the White Rabbit. She learns from nearby village inhabitants that the Queen of Hearts has put Wonderland in decline and despondency, and that the White Rabbit has promised a champion in Alice. Alice is directed to an old gnome who can aid her pursuit of the White Rabbit by reducing her size. The gnome and Alice infiltrate the Fortress of Doors and enter the school inside, where they create an elixir that shrinks Alice and allows her passage to the Vale of Tears.

After aiding the Mock Turtle in retrieving his stolen shell from the Duchess, Alice catches up to the White Rabbit, who takes her in the direction of the Caterpillar before he is crushed by the normal-sized Hatter&#x27;s foot. Alice meets with the Caterpillar, who explains to her that Wonderland&#x27;s current form is the result of Alice&#x27;s survivor guilt and advises her to slay the Queen of Hearts to restore Wonderland&#x27;s integrity. Alice returns to normal size after nibbling from a mushroom guarded by the Voracious Centipede. In the center of a plateau, Alice discovers a piece of the Jabberwock&#x27;s Eye Staff. The voice of an unseen oracle tells Alice that before the Queen of Hearts can be slain, Alice must first eliminate the Queen&#x27;s sentinel – the Jabberwock, who she must kill to obtain the final piece of the Eye Staff. In her search for the remaining pieces of the Eye Staff, Alice defeats the Red King in the chess-themed Looking-Glass Land, as well as the Hatter&#x27;s minions Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Alice later finds that the Hatter is conducting cruel experiments on the March Hare and Dormouse, and he is keeping the Gryphon captive. After killing the Hatter, Alice frees the Gryphon, who offers to rally forces against the Queen of Hearts and takes Alice to the Land of Fire and Brimstone, the abode of the Jabberwock. Within the remains of Alice&#x27;s old home, the Jabberwock wracks Alice with guilt over her parents&#x27; deaths and overpowers her in a fight until the Gryphon returns and rescues Alice by depriving the Jabberwock of one of his eyes.

With the Jabberwock&#x27;s Eye Staff fully assembled, the Gryphon directs Alice to Queensland and takes off with the intention of stopping the Jabberwock himself. On her way to the Queen of Hearts&#x27;s castle, Alice sees the Gryphon and the Jabberwock engaged in an aerial battle, which ends with the Gryphon mortally wounded. Following Alice&#x27;s victory against the Jabberwock, the dying Gryphon entrusts Alice with the final battle against the Queen of Hearts. At the entrance to the Queen&#x27;s Hall, the Cheshire Cat attempts to confess to Alice about the nature of the Queen of Hearts, but he is suddenly executed as he states that &quot;You are two parts of the same...&quot; Alice engages in a fight with a figure puppeteered by the real Queen of Hearts, a giant fleshy tentacled creature who warns Alice that destroying her will destroy them both. Upon Alice&#x27;s final victory over the Queen of Hearts, Wonderland is restored, and many of the characters who had died in the journey are revived. Her mind repaired, Alice leaves Rutledge Asylum.

==Development==
===Conception===
After leaving id Software in 1997, creative director American McGee was inspired to design a game that did not involve space marines, guns, aliens and outer space, which were the common themes in the &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; series. McGee&#x27;s dark and lustrous image of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; was primarily inspired by the Crystal Method track &quot;Trip Like I Do&quot;, in which he heard the word &quot;wonder&quot;. Following this inspiration, McGee and his creative partner R.J. Berg began sketching a narrative and preliminary designs. McGee&#x27;s goal was to present what he considered to be a natural extension of the setting and characters of the original &quot;Alice&quot; novels. Many of the early experiments with evolving the material of the novel – which included manga, futuristic, cartoon and sexual interpretations – strayed from McGee&#x27;s intended direction. Sketches of Alice, the Cheshire Cat and the Hatter by Terry Smith and Norm Felchle played a decisive role in establishing the game&#x27;s visual style and served as a foundation for subsequent concept art. McGee sought to omit shortcomings in products that he had previously designed, such as recreating reality instead of creating a fantastic world, reusing traditional weapons, and unremarkable characters. The game had a budget of $4.5 million.

While working on the game&#x27;s plot, McGee considered several approaches to Alice&#x27;s return to Wonderland, one of which involved a modern-day Alice murdering her abusive stepfather in reality while journeying through Wonderland, which was rejected by EA. Another approach involved the projection of Alice&#x27;s parents and acquaintances onto the characters of Wonderland and Alice investigating the cause of her father&#x27;s death. After discarding this concept as too complicated, McGee ultimately aimed for &quot;the simplest story that told the most&quot;. Aside from the reappearance of characters and locations mentioned in the novels, no references to the novels&#x27; plots are made in the game, as McGee did not intend for the game to be a continuation or competing version of Carroll&#x27;s work. The development team solely used the original novels as reference material, ignoring film adaptations and other derivative works.

The game&#x27;s title, which includes McGee&#x27;s name, was chosen at EA&#x27;s insistence, primarily for the ease of registering and protecting a new trademark. McGee admitted that he did not support the title, as he opined that it put the rest of the development team in the background. &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; is McGee&#x27;s debut work as a lead game designer.

===Development and marketing===
EA licensed Ritual Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.²&quot; engine, which is in turn a modified &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; engine. The most notable changes in the engine include the use of the Tiki model system, which enables the engine to use skeletal animation among other things, the Babble dialog system which enables lip synching of audio with character animations, dynamic music system, scriptable camera, particle system and extended shader support. The changes implemented to the engine for &quot;Alice&quot; remained minimal however. The game&#x27;s .bsp files even retain &quot;F.A.K.K.²&quot;″s headers, albeit sporting a different version number.

An early version of the game featured the ability to summon the Cheshire Cat to aid the player in battle. Though this feature was removed from the final product, beta screenshots of this version do exist online. In the final product, the player can press a button to summon the Cheshire Cat at any time, though he merely provides cryptic advice on the current situation and does nothing to aid Alice if she is being attacked. An &quot;Alice&quot; port for the then-unreleased PlayStation 2 was also in development but was later cancelled, which caused Rogue Entertainment to shut down, another decision which angered American McGee and resulted him leaving EA in frustration.

The game&#x27;s box art was altered after release to show Alice holding the Ice Wand instead of the Vorpal Blade and to reduce the skeletal character of the Cheshire Cat&#x27;s anatomy. EA cited complaints from various consumer groups as its reason for altering the original art, though McGee stated the alteration was made due to internal concerns at EA.

&quot;Alice&quot; was EA&#x27;s first M-rated game, a rating which McGee fought to obtain, because he did not want an &quot;Alice&quot; product to be sold at Christmas time, since parents could be confused, thinking that the game was intended to be a gift for children. However, in a 2009 interview, McGee expressed regret for his decision and said that the violence in the game did not warrant an M-rating; he felt that consumers should buy products responsibly after referring to the recommendations of the ESRB.

==Music==
All of the music created for the official &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; soundtrack was written and performed by Chris Vrenna with the help of guitarist Mark Blasquez and singer Jessicka. Most of the sounds he used were created using toy instruments and percussion, music boxes (in a short documentary about the making of the game that appeared on TechTV, the music box used appears to be an antique Fisher-Price music box pocket radio), clocks, doors, and sampled female voices were manipulated into nightmarish soundscapes, including instances of them laughing maniacally, screaming, crying, and singing in an eerie, childlike way.

The music lends an eerie and horrifying feeling to the world Alice is in. The Pale Realm theme, as well as the track &quot;I&#x27;m Not Edible&quot;, features the melody of the chorus of a popular children&#x27;s song, &quot;My Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot;. In addition, there are many instances of the ticking and chiming of clocks being used as a musical accompaniment.

Marilyn Manson was originally involved scoring the music for the game. His composition has been described by American McGee as &quot;very cool&quot; and having &quot;a very beautiful Beatles-in-their-harpsichord-and-Hookah-pipe-days-sound to it.&quot; Manson&#x27;s contributions persisted into the final product, notably the influence of alchemy and the character of the Mad Hatter whose adaptation was somewhat influenced by him; for a time Manson was considered for the voice of the Hatter. Manson has indicated that the same music may be used in his forthcoming film &quot;&quot;.

&quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice Original Music Score&quot; was released on October 16, 2001, by Six Degrees Records. It features all twenty original compositions by former Nine Inch Nails live drummer and studio collaborator Chris Vrenna with vocals done by Jessicka Addams of Jack Off Jill and Scarling. It includes a previously unreleased theme as well as a remix of &quot;Flying on the Wings of Steam&quot;.

==Merchandise and promotion ==

&quot;Alice&quot; produced merchandise until its forthcoming sequel &quot;Alice: Madness Returns&quot;, this included action figurines, clothing and knife replicas. These pieces have become coveted collectors items due to the low efforts in manufacturing. The soundtrack was released on CD. With pre-ordering the physical copy of the game, you would receive a miniature figure of the Cheshire Cat made of pewter. In 2000, Prima Games published the &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice: Official Strategy Guide&quot;.

In 2004, there was a collaboration 7&quot; clear blue LP &quot;&#x27;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; Blue Vinyl&#x27; from EA and Atari of two sides, Side A: &#x27;Wonderland Woods (Tweaker Remix)&#x27; and Side B: &#x27;Take the Pill&#x27; from Enter the Matrix composed, produced and remixed by Chris Vrenna. These LP&#x27;s were limited to 500 copies and signed by McGee and Vrenna.

In 2006, Muckle Mannequins created life-sized statues of Alice and the Cheshire Cat on stands with variants for video game stores for international promotion from its success. For costume ware American McGee&#x27;s company &quot;Mysterious&quot; released a replica of the Omega Necklace worn by Alice throughout the game. There was also casual clothing items released such as t-shirts, backpacks, beanies and wallets.

Milo&#x27;s Workshop completed four editions of releases from 2000 to 2009 of official figurines with rare editions of variants of Alice with the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, TweddleDum and TweedleDee, Card Guards of the Red Queen, the Caterpillar and the Jabberwocky. In 2003, Milo&#x27;s Workshop presented the 20&quot; Cheshire Cat statue with limited 1000 created.

In 2010, for the 10th anniversary, there was a release of the a Vorpal Blade replica by Epic Weapons with a display stand to be sold, you could have also bought and pre-ordered them for San Diego Comic-Con as well as being able to participate in an auction for the first 25 blades.

In 2011, Epic Weapons released a packaged deal with the &quot;Alice: Madness Returns&quot; Vorpal Blade replica. The Vorpal Blade was limited to 1000 replicas.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; sold 360,000 units by August 2006. As of September 2017, the game has sold 1.5 million copies. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 47th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.

The game was ultimately released on December 5, 2000, receiving praise for its visuals; the graphics were very elaborate for their time. Many levels depict a world of chaos and wonder, some reminiscent of the inside of an asylum or a madhouse, visually linking Wonderland to Alice&#x27;s reality. The exterior views of Wonderland show the Queen of Hearts&#x27; tentacles dipping out of buildings and mountain sides, especially in Queensland. &quot;Alice&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said, &quot;While you&#x27;ll undoubtedly enjoy the imaginative artwork, you might end up disappointed with just how straightforward the underlying game really is.&quot;

In her article &quot;Wonderland&#x27;s become quite strange: From Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; to &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;&quot;, literary critic Cathlena Martin argues that the game &quot;provides a reinterpreted version of Alice and the whole of wonderland that may have some players questioning which aspects are from Carroll and which are from McGee, thus potentially leading to a rereading of Carroll through the darker lens of McGee&#x27;s Alice. This reinterpretation of Alice shows the versatility and mutability of the story across time and discourse.&quot; Martin also notes that the game is successful largely in part to the narrative structure of Carroll&#x27;s tales, which are built around games - cards and chess - themselves.

Blake Fischer reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Alice&quot; is an incredibly beautiful and well-designed shooter. If you&#x27;re looking for more, you may pass, but otherwise it&#x27;s a game you won&#x27;t want to miss.&quot;
==Film adaptation==
===Conception and Wes Craven===
A film adaptation of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; was planned prior to the game&#x27;s release. Scott Faye, a spokesman for Dimension Films and an old acquaintance of McGee, visited EA to negotiate an adaptation of an EA product. Faye and other Dimension Films representatives were shown gameplay footage of &quot;Alice&quot; and were impressed by its visuals. Later, Miramax head Bob Weinstein was shown the game&#x27;s trailer, after which he immediately (and without waiting for the opinion of the board of directors) supported the production of a film adaptation. On July 5, 2000, FGN Online published an exclusive piece claiming that EA had signed an agreement with Miramax to create a film based on the game. According to the publisher&#x27;s source, American McGee would be involved in the film&#x27;s production, potentially as a creative director or co-producer.

On December 7, 2000, McGee formally announced the film adaptation, which had been entrusted with Collision Entertainment, a subsidiary of Dimension Films, after ten months of negotiations. Wes Craven and John August were attached as director and screenwriter, with McGee co-producing the film alongside Collision Entertainment, and Abandon Entertainment acting as international distributor. No actors had yet been signed on, but Natalie Portman was rumored to have expressed interest. Milla Jovovich and Christina Ricci were also rumored to be attached. In September 2001, August explained that he had turned in a script treatment for &quot;Alice&quot; and was not attached to develop fuller drafts for the film adaptation.

In December 2001, Craven announced that the film would be a computer-animated feature with a tentative 2003 release date. In February 2002, Dimension Films signed brother screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber to write a new screenplay for &quot;Alice&quot;. In July 2003, the brothers announced that they had completed the script for the film adaptation. On March 4, 2004, McGee reported that the project had moved from Dimension Films to 20th Century Fox.

===Marcus Nispel===
On June 21, 2005, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Universal Pictures had acquired the film and signed Sarah Michelle Gellar on for the lead role, with Marcus Nispel attached to direct and the Hoeber brothers still attached to write. On February 8, 2006, Scott Faye, who had become a producer of the project, announced that filming would begin in the summer of 2006, with a budget of $40 to $50 million and a tentative 2007 release date. By 2008, the project was in turnaround, and Nispel and Gellar&#x27;s involvement had ceased. Rumors circulated of Jane March being cast as the Queen of Hearts, which Faye denied.

===Short films===
In June 2013, American McGee was given the opportunity to buy back the film rights which were originally sold several years prior. Through Kickstarter, McGee managed to fund the cost of the film rights ($100,000) and another $100,000 for the production of the shorts. In August, the project was successfully funded with an extra $50,000 (used to fund the voice acting of Susie Brann and Roger L. Jackson).

With the success of earning the funds to produce &quot;&quot;, McGee stated his desire to continue to work on the possibility of adapting the series into a feature film on Kickstarter. On February 17, 2014, McGee announced that he and his team have secured a British screenwriter to write the film&#x27;s script. On April 16, 2014, he assured fans that the film is still in production and is currently working with a producer in Hollywood who they have licensed the rights from, but has run into a few difficulties along the way.

On July 10, 2014, McGee informed fans that the progress on the feature film has come to a temporary halt. McGee stated that he had secured the rights only to develop the feature film&#x27;s story and production and needed to acquire the film rights completely before proceeding further. He was speaking with potential investors and financiers to gather the $400,000 (~$ in ) required but on January 8, 2015, McGee stated that negotiations for the feature film had gone on a hiatus.

==Television adaptation==
On January 31, 2022, it was announced that Radar Pictures – in partnership with Abandon Entertainment – was developing a television adaptation of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; written and co-produced by David Hayter. No broadcaster or streaming platform has yet acquired the series.

==Sequel==

As the plans for the movie adaptation of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; started to take longer and longer, in 2007 interest at Electronic Arts rose in a remake of the game and work was started on a sequel. On February 19, 2009, EA CEO John Riccitiello announced at D.I.C.E. 2009 that a new installment to the series is in the works for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

It was developed by Spicy Horse, who worked on &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Grimm&quot;. Two pieces of concept art were released, depicting Alice and large allied birds fighting an oversized, semi-mechanized snail and its children on top of a lighthouse, and Alice swimming in a pond, with the Cheshire Cat&#x27;s face in the background.

In November 2009, a fan-made video based on the &quot;Alice 2&quot; announcement was mistaken by gaming websites as a teaser trailer for the game. In it, Alice is in therapy after a relapse nine months after the events of the first game, and she appears to hallucinate an image of the Cheshire Cat in place of her doctor.

On June 15, 2010, EA filed a trademark on the name &quot;&quot;, the suspected sequel to &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;. While the sequel was formally announced via press release on February 19, 2009, the sequel&#x27;s title was confirmed during the EA Studio Showcase the following day.

The game was released on June 14, 2011, in North America, June 16, 2011, in Europe, June 17, 2011, in the United Kingdom and July 21, 2011, in Japan under the title &quot;&quot; for PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions came with a redemption code that gave the player a free download of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;. This version is available through backward compatibility on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and is part of the EA Play service on these platforms. It is found under the DLC for &quot;Madness Returns&quot;.

<text>The pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta) is a large black and white wader in the avocet and stilt family, Recurvirostridae. They breed in temperate Europe and across the Palearctic to Central Asia then on to the Russian Far East. It is a migratory species and most winter in Africa or southern Asia. Some remain to winter in the mildest parts of their range, for example in southern Spain and southern England. The pied avocet is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

== Taxonomy ==
The pied avocet was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Recurvirostra avosetta&quot;. This species gets its English and scientific names from the Venetian word &quot;avosetta&quot;. It appeared first in Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s &quot;Ornithologia&quot; (1603). While the name may refer to black and white outfits once worn by European advocates or lawyers, the actual etymology is uncertain. Other common names include black-capped avocet, Eurasian avocet or just avocet.

It is one of four species of avocet that make up the genus &quot;Recurvirostra&quot;. The genus name is from Latin &quot;recurvus&quot;, &quot;curved backwards&quot; and &quot;rostrum&quot;, &quot;bill&quot;. A 2004 study combining genetics and morphology showed that it was the most divergent species in the genus.

==Description==
The pied avocet is a striking white wader with bold black markings. Adults have white plumage except for a black cap and black patches in the wings and on the back. They have long, upturned bills and long, bluish legs. It is approximately in length of which the bill is approximately and the legs are approximately . Its wingspan is approximately . Males and females look alike. The juvenile resembles the adult but with more greyish and sepia tones.

The call of the avocet is a far-carrying, liquid, melodious &quot;kluit kluit&quot;.

==Behaviour==
These birds forage in shallow brackish water or on mud flats, often scything their bills from side to side in water (a feeding technique that is unique to the avocets). They mainly eat crustaceans and insects.

Their breeding habitat is shallow lakes with brackish water and exposed bare mud. They nest on open ground, often in small groups, sometimes with other waders. Three to five eggs are laid in a lined scrape or on a mound of vegetation.

==In Britain==
The pied avocet was extirpated as a breeding species in Great Britain by 1840. Its successful recolonisation at Minsmere, Suffolk, in 1947 led to its adoption as the logo of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The pied avocet has spread inland and northwards and westwards in Britain since then and it has bred in Wales and in Scotland in 2018 at Skinflats. Avocets have been sighted wintering at Browhouses, Dumfries and Galloway.

<text>Émile Eugène Jean Louis Cohl (; né Courtet; 4 January 1857 – 20 January 1938) was a French caricaturist of the Incoherent Movement, cartoonist, and animator, called &quot;The Father of the Animated Cartoon&quot;.

== Biography ==
Émile&#x27;s father, Elie, was a rubber salesman, and his mother, Emilie Laure, a linen seamstress. The rubber factory Elie worked for had many ups and downs, causing the family to move from one home in Paris to another.

=== Early years ===
Émile’s father was often busy, and Émile lived with his ailing mother until her death in 1863. In 1864, at the age of 7, he was enrolled at the Ecole professionnelle de Pantin, a boarding school known as the Institute Vaudron after its founder. There his artistic talents were discovered and encouraged. The next year, a cold kept him confined in his father&#x27;s apartment, where he began stamp collecting, a hobby that would become his sole source of income several times in his life.

The chaos caused by the Franco-Prussian War and the following siege of Paris led to the closing of Elie Courtet&#x27;s rubber factory. Émile was transferred to the less-exclusive Ecole Turgot, but his lessons were soon forgotten as the teenager wandered the streets of Paris to watch history being made. He made two discoveries that in time that became the controlling elements of his life: &quot;Guignol&quot; puppet theater and political caricature. &quot;Guignol&quot; was a form of drama (usually involving love triangles), in which the characters were played by marionettes. A subtype of the &quot;Guignol&quot; was &quot;Fantoche&quot;, a form of puppetry in which the puppeteer&#x27;s head was stuck through a hole in a black sheet with a small puppet body underneath.

Political caricature had begun in France during the Second Empire, but had been suppressed by Napoleon III. During the free-for-all weeks of the Commune (all 11 of them), the caricaturists were free to post broadsheets on the streets for all to see. The center of this activity was the Rue du Croissant, only blocks from the Ecole Turgot.

In 1872, Elie Courtet placed his 15-year-old son in a three-year apprenticeship with a jeweler. Émile drew caricatures, enlisted in the Cherbourg regiment, and drew some more. Elie placed him with a maritime insurance broker. Émile left the broker, got a much poorer-paying job with a philatelist and declared his preference for drawing, the Bohemian lifestyle, and if necessary, going hungry.

=== Years with André Gill ===
In 1878, Émile obtained a letter of recommendation from Étienne Carjat to approach André Gill, the best-known caricaturist of the day, for a job. Gill had made his fame a decade earlier by publishing &quot;La Lune&quot;, a periodical critical of Napoleon III. His presses were smashed and he was incarcerated. He started &quot;La Lune Rousse&quot; in 1876 to continue his work. By this time, he had moved beyond attacking individuals to making observations on the ludicrousness of conformist bourgeois values in general. However, the government was becoming increasingly liberal, leaving him with few big-name targets. As a result, &quot;La Lune Rousse&quot; closed in 1879.

Émile Courtet&#x27;s job as one of several assistants to Gill was to complete the backgrounds; he may have done a few of the illustrations by himself. During this process, he developed a style of caricature based on Gill&#x27;s. Gill&#x27;s trademark was the large, recognizable head of the target (with a fairly benign expression) atop a small puppet body (doing something ridiculous). Clearly, it was based on &quot;Fantoche&quot; puppetry. Émile took this style and added touches to suggest movement and imagery from the rest of &quot;Guignol&quot; puppetry. At about this time, he adopted the pseudonym of &quot;Émile Cohl&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Cohl&quot; is obscure: it may be from the pigment known as &quot;kohl&quot;, or perhaps it means that Émile stuck to his mentor Gill like glue (&quot;colle&quot; in French). Perhaps it was chosen because it sounded exotic. The visual signature of a paste-pot appears in a few of Cohl&#x27;s caricatures.

Adolphe Thiers was succeeded as president by Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta, a conservative monarchist who had been at Sedan. He became steadily less popular under the assault of caricatures. One of these, &quot;Aveugle par Ac-Sedan&quot;, a French pun on &quot;accidentally blind&quot; and &quot;Bungler at Sedan&quot;, put its creator, Émile Cohl, in jail on 11 October 1879, making him instantly famous. Three months later, MacMahon resigned in disgrace—the caricaturists liked to believe that they were responsible. He was succeeded by Jules Grévy, who transferred real power from the post of president to the prime minister and legislature. This led to a period of internal stability and prosperity for France.

Through Gill, Cohl (as he was now known) had become acquainted with an artistic circle calling themselves the Hydropathes. The group was united by various &quot;modern&quot; ideas and a love of poetry. The group, like many others of the time, based most of their activities on shocking people. As a result of his new-found fame, Cohl was named editor of the group&#x27;s spokes-piece, &quot;L&#x27;Hydropathe&quot;, in October 1879. In 1880 he was also invited to join the Fumist group led by Alphonse Allais and . At about this time, Cohl&#x27;s estranged father died, leaving him a modest legacy. Cohl set out to discover his abilities, writing and producing two satiric plays that did very poorly. The co-author of both plays was Norés (pseudonym of Edouard Norés), an American who had been an architect before giving up his former life for Bohemianism on the banks of the Seine. Besides a strong friendship, Norés taught Cohl English, a useful skill later on.

=== End of the Hydropathes ===
Cohl married on 12 November 1881; his wife later left him for an author. At the same time, André Gill was committed to the Charenton mental asylum. He managed to recover in a few months and in 1882 submitted his first serious painting, &quot;Le Fou&quot; (The Madman), to the Salon. The painting&#x27;s poor reception by the artists of the Salon sent him back to Charenton.

Meanwhile, the Hydropathes disbanded in 1882. Their place in Cohl&#x27;s life was replaced by the Incoherents, a group founded by Jules Lévy, who coined the phrase &quot;les arts incohérents&quot; as a contrast to the common expression &quot;les arts décoratifs&quot;. The Incoherents were even less politically minded than the Hydropathes. Their slogan was &quot;Gaity is properly French, so let&#x27;s be French&quot;. The focus was absurdism, nightmares, and the drawing style of children. Cohl&#x27;s Incoherent art joined his caricatures and satiric news reporting at &quot;La Nouvelle Lune&quot;, where he had become the major contributor and acting editor. He became editor in chief in November 1883.

By that time, the Incoherents had become so popular that an exhibit was arranged at the Vivienne Gallery, open to the public. It was called &quot;an exhibition of drawings by people who do not know how to draw.&quot; Cohl&#x27;s contribution was titled &quot;Portrait garanti ressemblant&quot; (Portrait—Resemblance Guaranteed). The exhibit accepted any and all entries, so long as they were not obscene or serious. The public was taken with the show, and the profits were donated to public assistance. There was a second show in 1884, and the 1885 show was replaced by a masked ball (Cohl went as an artichoke). In 1886, Cohl produced his most bizarre and characteristic work in the Incoherent vein: &quot;Abus des metaphors&quot;, a collection of more than a dozen colourful expressions brought to life.

=== Death of André Gill ===

Cohl&#x27;s personal life was nowhere as rosy as his professional life would suggest, despite the birth of his daughter Marcelle Andrée in May 1883. Gill never recovered his sanity, and after a few months Charenton seized his property and drawings, auctioning them off to pay their bills. Cohl was unable to keep his hero in the public eye. Gill died on May Day, 1885, with only Cohl by his side. Cohl never forgot Gill&#x27;s desertion by his friends and the public. The Incoherent movement collapsed in 1888.

After the collapse of his marriage, Cohl moved to London to work for &quot;Pick Me Up&quot;, a humor magazine that specialized in French artists (he left his long-standing second job as a philatelist at this time). He returned to Paris in June 1896 and married Suzanne Delpy, the daughter of one of Gill&#x27;s followers. Their son André Jean was born on 8 November 1899. By this time, Cohl had moved away from caricature, sending humorous drawings to bicycle magazines, family magazines, and children&#x27;s magazines. He also wrote articles on French history, stamps, and fishing. In July 1898, he started contributing to &quot;L&#x27;Illustré National&quot;. This would become the origin of Cohl&#x27;s comic strips. At the same time, Cohl&#x27;s art moved from scene-setting to story-telling, and from the Gill &quot;fantoche&quot; style to Impressionism. Other interests during this period included puzzles, toys (he invented a few new ones), and drawings of figures made from wax matches. In the political arena, he submitted anti-Dreyfus illustrations to &quot;La Libre Parole Illustrée&quot;.

=== Motion pictures ===
By 1907, the 50-year-old Émile Cohl, like everyone else in Paris, had become aware of motion pictures. How he actually entered the business is shrouded in legend. According to Jean-Georges Auriol in a book published in 1930, one day Cohl was walking down the street when he spotted a poster advertising a movie obviously stolen from one of his strips. Outraged, he confronted the manager of the offending studio (Gaumont) and was hired on the spot as a scenarist (responsible for one-page story ideas for movies). The story is rather doubtful in the detail of which strip and which short film; it is also possible that the story is completely false, and that Cohl was approached for the job, either by director Etienne Arnaud or by artistic director Louis Feuillade, both of whom had once worked for caricature papers and therefore could be expected to know Cohl by reputation, if not personally.

At Gaumont, Cohl collaborated with the other directors whenever possible, learning cinematography from Arnaud and directing chases, comedies, &quot;féeries&quot; (&quot;fairy pieces&quot;), and pageants. But his specialty was animation. He worked in a corner of the studio with a vertically mounted Gaumont camera and a single assistant to operate it. He turned out four sequences a month for insertion in mostly live action films. Studio director Léon Gaumont, in one of his visits, dubbed him &quot;the Benedictine&quot;.

The idea for doing animation was born from the huge success of the film &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot;, released by Vitagraph and directed by J. Stuart Blackton. It premiered in Paris in April 1907 and there was immediately a demand for more films using its incredible object animation techniques. According to a story told by Arnaud in 1922, Gaumont had ordered his staff to figure out the &quot;mystery of &#x27;The Haunted Hotel&#x27;.&quot; Cohl studied the film frame by frame, and in this way discovered the techniques of animation. Cohl, who was always seeking to enlarge his reputation in later life, never corroborated this story. Also, there were a fair number of films released before 1907 with stop-motion and/or drawn animation in them, by Blackton and others, any one of which could have taught Cohl animation, if he didn&#x27;t just work the technique out on his own. The main reason &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; is significant is the fact that it was popular enough to make the arduous work of animation profitable.
Cohl made &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; from February to May or June 1908. This is considered the first fully animated film. It was made up of 700 drawings, each of which was double-exposed (animated &quot;on twos&quot;), leading to a running time of almost two minutes. Despite the short running time, the piece was packed with material devised in a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style. It borrowed from Blackton in using a &quot;chalk-line effect&quot; (filming black lines on white paper, then reversing the negative to make it look like white chalk on a black chalkboard), having the main character drawn by the artist&#x27;s hand on camera, and the main characters of a clown and a gentleman (this taken from Blackton&#x27;s &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot;). The film, in all of its wild transformations, is a direct tribute to the by-then forgotten . The title is a reference to the &quot;fantasmograph&quot;, a mid-Nineteenth Century variant of the magic lantern that projected ghostly images that floated across the walls.

&quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; was released on 17 August 1908. This was followed by two more films, &quot;Le Cauchemar du fantoche&quot; [&quot;The Puppet&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;] and &quot;Un Drame chez les fantoches&quot; [&quot;A Puppet Drama&quot;, called &quot;The Love Affair in Toyland&quot; for American release and &quot;Mystical Love-Making&quot; for British release], all completed in 1908. These three films are united by their chalk-line style, the stick-figure clown protagonists, and the constant transformations. Cohl made the plots of these films up as he was filming them. He would put a drawing on the lightbox, photograph it, trace onto next sheet with slight changes, photograph that, and so on. This meant that the pictures did not jitter and the plot was spontaneous. Cohl had to calculate the timing in advance. The process was demanding and time-consuming, which is probably why he moved away from drawn animation after &quot;Un Drame chez les fantoches&quot;.

The rest of the films Cohl made for Gaumont involve strange transformations (&quot;Les Joyeux Microbes&quot; [&quot;The Joyous Microbes&quot;, aka &quot;The Merry Microbes&quot; (UK)] (1909)), some great matte effects (&quot;Clair de lune espagno&quot; [&quot;Spanish Moonlight&quot;, aka &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; (US), aka &quot;The Moon-Struck Matador&quot; (UK)] (1909)), and loving puppet animation (&quot;Le Tout Petit Faust&quot; [&quot;The Little Faust&quot;, aka &quot;The Beautiful Margaret&quot; (US)] (1910)). Other films used jointed cut-outs or animated matches (the later an especial favorite of Cohl&#x27;s).
In his lifetime, Cohl&#x27;s most famous film was &quot;Le Peintre néo-impressionniste&quot; [&quot;The Neo-Impressionistic Painter&quot;], made in 1910. An artist is sketching a classically draped model holding a broom as a stick-figure when a collector storms in demanding to know the progress of his work. The artist shows the collector a series of blank colored canvases (the film is color-tinted). As he gives their ridiculous titles, the collector imagines them being drawn on the canvas. For example, the red canvas is &quot;A cardinal eating lobster with tomatoes by the banks of the Red Sea&quot;. The collector is soon so delirious that he buys every blank canvas he can see. Quite obviously, the artist is not a neo-Impressionist (the name taken from the latest vogue in Paris)--he&#x27;s an Incoherent.

The Cohl animated films had a large impact through their American distribution by Kleine. Many of them received rave reviews in the trade magazines, although Cohl was identified only as &quot;Gaumont&#x27;s animator&quot;. It was probably in response to &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; that Winsor McCay made &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1911). Motifs of Cohl&#x27;s can be found in &quot;Little Nemo&quot; and later films by McCay: the dots coalescing into Little Nemo reflect effects in &quot;Un Drame Chez les Fantoches&quot; and &quot;Les Joyeux Microbes&quot;; the metamorphosis of the rose into the Princess may have been inspired by &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot;; the titular character of &quot;The Story of a Mosquito&quot; (1912) sharpening his beak comes from &quot;Un Drame Chez les Fantoches&quot;; the live-action/animation interaction of McCay throwing a pumpkin to &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; (1914) may have been an answer to the matador hurling his hatchet at the moon in &quot;Clair de lune espagnol&quot;. But if there were borrowings of Cohl by McCay, there was also a wealth of style and spirit in McCay&#x27;s films that were uniquely his own.

On 30 November 1910, Cohl left Gaumont for Pathé, probably for more money. He made only two animated films before being forced into exclusively live-action work as a director of burlesques starring Jobard (Lucien Cazalis), one of the first generation of great screen comics. Cohl made ten Jobard films between March and May 1911 before leaving for a vacation. Apparently, one of these films was the origin of pixilation, the technique of applying stop-motion to human beings.

One of those two animated films was &quot;Le Ratapeur de cervelles&quot; [&quot;Brains Repaired&quot;], which is a rehash of &quot;Les Joyeux Microbes&quot; using a mental disease. The transformations here are some of the most remarkable (and non-sensical) of Cohl&#x27;s career: as two men shake hands in profile, their heads expand into huge crossed bird beaks, filling the screen in a zoom until only their shared eye is seen, which itself expands into a bellows. The other film, &quot;La Revanche des esprits&quot; [The Spirit&#x27;s Revenge] (now lost), may have been the first film to combine live-action and animation by drawing directly on the live-action film (previous work had used mattes exclusively).

In September 1911, Émile Cohl learned that his daughter Andrée had died of a miscarriage. Dissatisfied with Pathé and too proud to return to Gaumont, Cohl signed with Eclipse in September. Only two of Cohl&#x27;s Eclipse films have survived; one of them, &quot;Les Exploits de Feu Follet&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Nipper&#x27;s Transformations&quot;), is currently seen as the first Western animation film which was shown for certain in a Japanese cinema (on 15 April 1912). The Eclipse contract was not exclusive, so Cohl made films for other studios. One of these films, &quot;Campbell Soups&quot;, was his first film made for Éclair, the number three studio in France.

At the beginning of the 20th century, many early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Éclair&#x27;s American studio was run by Cohl&#x27;s friend Arnaud. As Éclair was moving into comedies for American audiences, it was not too hard for Arnaud to have his friend sent over the Atlantic to join him. Cohl, his wife Suzanne, and their son André sailed first class from Le Havre to New York City. At Ellis Island, he was required, for &quot;sanitary reasons&quot;, to shave off the mustache he had worn for thirty years in honour of André Gill.

Despite the inevitable xenophobia from the locals, the French colony at Fort Lee was enthusiastic about having finally invaded the coveted American market. Cohl bought a house and settled into a typical middle-class American lifestyle. He had a considerable advantage over fellow-Éclair employees, as he was fluent in English.

Cohl had two basic assignments at Fort Lee: humorous newsreel inserts and &quot;The Newlyweds&quot; animated series. The newsreel (one of the first of its kind) was started by the Sales Company in March 1912 and continued by Universal (Éclair&#x27;s distributor). &quot;The Newlyweds&quot; started life as a newspaper comic strip by George McManus in the New York &quot;World&quot;. The three main characters are a fashionable woman drawn in the style of the &quot;Gibson Girl&quot;, her obliging husband, and Baby Snookums, an absolute hellion of a child who nevertheless gets everything he wants (usually at the expense of the father). The series was popular both in the United States and in France (under the name &quot;Le Petit Ange&quot;). Cohl wanted to make the first animated series, and he liked &quot;The Newlyweds&quot;. As for McManus, he may have been convinced to sign with Cohl at the urging of his friend Winsor McCay. Prior to this point, there had been a few adaptations of comic series into films, but they were all live action. Examples include &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot; (starring J. Stuart Blackton as the title character), &quot;Buster Brown&quot;, and &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; (later to become a successful animated series).

Cohl began work on &quot;The Newlyweds&quot; series in November 1912, and the films began appearing in theaters in March 1913. The ads for the &quot;Newlyweds&quot; films are the oldest on record to use the phrase &quot;animated cartoons&quot;; as would be usual for all of the following comic adaptations, only the comic artist is mentioned in the advertising, never the animator. Cohl achieved his speed (13 &quot;Newlyweds&quot; cartoons in 13 months) by using the bare minimum of actual animation, the scenes consisting of static tableau with dialog balloons appearing above each character&#x27;s head (done faithfully in the McManus style). What little motion necessary was done with hinged cut-out figures animated by stop-motion. The only ingenuity in these films lay in the transitions between tableaux, which utilised Cohl&#x27;s trademark transformations. Nevertheless, Cohl had proved that commercial animation was possible. The series was an instant hit. Only one film in this series has survived, &quot;He Poses for His Portrait&quot; [aka &quot;Le Portrait de Zozor&quot; (Fr.)] (1913).

The success of the series led to an explosion of animation, all adaptations of newspaper comic strips, and few of them remembered today. Meanwhile, Cohl saw both &quot;The Story of a Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; live at the Hammerstein Theater in New York, and he recorded his admiration of each in his diary. For animation to be practical, it had to move beyond the techniques of Cohl (cut-outs) and McCay (tracing), both of which were arduous, single-person processes. Two men were to independently work out ways around this problem: Raoul Barré and John Randolph Bray. Barré studied art in Paris in the 1890s and was known for his pro-Dreyfus cartoons. In 1920, Cohl told the story of two unnamed visitors that Éclair had forced on him to study his techniques, techniques that they later stole to make their own series. It is possible that these two were Barré and his business partner William C. Nolan. It is possible that Cohl&#x27;s obvious hostility to his visitors was the result of the knowledge that they were on opposite sides in the Dreyfus Affair. On the other hand, Barré&#x27;s method for making cartoons quickly, the &quot;slash system&quot;, is the exact opposite of Cohl&#x27;s cut-out system. It is true that Barré&#x27;s series, &quot;The Animated Grouch Chasers&quot;, frequently stole characters and scenarios from Cohl, but then again everyone was doing that. John Randolph Bray, in collaboration with Earl Hurd, developed the patents that nearly made them the Motion Picture Patents Company of animated film. Animation historian Michael Barrier speculates that one of Cohl&#x27;s unnamed visitors may have been Bray instead of Barré.

=== World War I ===
On 11 March 1914, the Cohl family left New Jersey for Paris in response to a death in Suzanne&#x27;s family. They never returned. Eight days later, a fire destroyed most of Éclair&#x27;s American films, including all but two of Cohl&#x27;s films (&quot;He Poses for His Portrait&quot; and &quot;Bewitched Matches&quot; [aka &quot;Les Allumettes ensorcelées&quot; (Fr.)]). The latter is the only one of the animated matches films Cohl made to survive. The American studio later moved to Tucson, Arizona. The chaos caused by the fire brought Éclair&#x27;s work in France to a near-standstill. Cohl made a handful of films for Éclair in France, but the outbreak of World War I on 3 August 1914, forced those films to be held back for years before being released.

By 11 August 80% of the French film industry had enlisted or had been drafted. Cohl (at 57 years of age) was too old to fight, but he volunteered as best he could while working at Éclair. His heart was no longer in his work, for his beloved wife Suzanne was slowly dying. In 1916, American cartoons took France by storm. Gaumont imported &quot;The Animated Grouch Chasers&quot; and for the first time since the early films of Blackton, animated films were being advertised with the name and face of their animator, Raoul Barré. If Barré is the individual who &quot;stole&quot; Cohl&#x27;s techniques, this must have made Cohl furious (it didn&#x27;t help that it was his former employer that was doing all the hoopla).

It was at this moment that Cohl was approached by Benjamin Rabier, a popular illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Rabier wanted Cohl to animate his characters. The producer for the series was René Navarre, a former actor who had become famous playing the anti-hero Fantomas in a series of films in 1913 and 1914. The distributor was Agence Générale Cinematographique (AGC). The trio parted company over Cohl&#x27;s resentment that he was not being credited in the advertising. The series, &quot;Les Dessins animés de Benjamin Rabier&quot; (&quot;The Animated Drawings of Benjamin Rabier&quot;). starred Flambeau the War Dog. The only surviving film, &quot;Les Fiançailles de Flambeau&quot; [&quot;Flambeau&#x27;s Wedding&quot;] (released 1917), has cute naturalistic characters from Rabier and coarse morbid humor from Cohl. By the time of Cohl&#x27;s departure, Rabier had learned enough animation to carry on with the help of two assistants. The series lasted for several years.

Cohl continued work with Éclair throughout this debacle, mostly making newsreel inserts. Based on the few fragments that remain, the series &quot;Les Aventures des Pieds Nickelés&quot; [&quot;Adventures of the Leadfoot Gang&quot;] may have been the best work of Cohl&#x27;s career. It was based on a working class comic strip by Louis Forton about a gang of anarchistic youngsters constantly getting into trouble with both the criminal underground and the law. The series was terminated by the war, as the Éclair-Journal studios were occupied to make American war propaganda.

Cohl spent the rest of the war serving his country. He joined the United States Air Service Supply as a volunteer on 11 May 1918. His son André had joined the American Transportation Division the previous November.
With the war over, Cohl quit Éclair in May 1920 and made his last significant film, &quot;Fantoche cherche un logement&quot; [&quot;Puppet Looks for an Apartment&quot;]. It was released as &quot;La Maison du fantoche&quot; [&quot;Puppet&#x27;s Mansion&quot;] in April 1921 by AGC. The only notice paid to it in the trade journals was a one-line plot summary. Nobody cared about Cohl&#x27;s work anymore, or any other French filmmaker, for that matter. Cohl&#x27;s career was finished, since there was no longer any way to justify the cost of an animated short subject in a world of live-action features.

Cohl&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated during the Great Depression and he endured years of severe poverty. While his peer George Méliès was awarded the Legion of Honor medal in 1931, scant attention was given Cohl&#x27;s pioneering work in animated film. In the spring of 1937, at the age of 80, his face was lightly burned when a candle on his desk set fire to his beard. During a couple of months stay at a charity hospital, the young film journalist René Jeanne helped organize a benefit screening of Cohl&#x27;s work, which played at the Champs-Elysées Cinema on 19 January 1938, the day before Cohl&#x27;s death, two weeks after his 81st birthday. Coincidentally, Georges Méliès died hours later.

Cohl&#x27;s ashes are kept in the columbarium of the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris.

<text>The Kaimai Range (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Kaimai Ranges&quot;) is a mountain range in the North Island of New Zealand. It is part of a series of ranges, with the Coromandel Range to the north and the Mamaku Ranges to the south. The Kaimai Range separates the Waikato in the west from the Bay of Plenty in the east.

The highest point of the range is Mount Te Aroha (953 m), at the foot of which is the town of Te Aroha. The range&#x27;s terrain is rough, and only two roads pass over it: State Highway 2, across the northern end of the range through Karangahake Gorge, and State Highway 29 from Tauranga to Hamilton. Mt Te Aroha can be described as the northern head peak of the Kaimai Range.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;eat fermented food&quot; for &quot;Kaimāī&quot;.

The Kaimai Ranges feature in local Māori folklore. The name Te Aroha translates from Māori as Te - The &amp; Aroha - Love. Literally &quot;the love&quot;. The name comes from a Māori legend that the sun god - male - loved the moon goddess - female. They never could see each another due to the planets positions. One day the moon goddess came to earth to see the sun god, knowing the risks, was turned to stone as the daylight came. Hers was the ultimate expression of love: Te Aroha in Māori. This is why on the Kaimai Range, to the right of Mt Te Aroha is a high skyline silhouetted rock that from afar is shaped as a woman. It is known locally as the rock of Hinemoa.

Within the Kaimai Ranges the Hendersons Tramline loop track follows the route of bush tramlines and haul lines once used to extract logs from the bush. The walk includes forest and clearings near the fringe of the park. A side track off the main walk leads down to the base of a waterfall and a large swimming hole.
Also some 10–16 km, on the Gordon backroad from te Aroha is a four-wheel drive track named Thomsons track, that takes venturers from the foothills around manawaru to the ranges top, where a large swimming hole is present.

==Geology and history==
The Kaimai Range is the result of a fault that uplifted primarily andesitic rocks from long-extinct volcanoes. This fault has not been active for about 140,000 years and started more than a million years ago. In pre-European times, the area was densely forested by trees such as kauri, mataī and tawa, and was a home for birds such as kererū, tūī, kākā and kiwi.

==Demographics==
Kaimai statistical area, which does not include the entire range, covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Kaimai had a population of 2,028 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 276 people (15.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 327 people (19.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 678 households, comprising 1,026 males and 1,005 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.02 males per female. The median age was 40.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 426 people (21.0%) aged under 15 years, 312 (15.4%) aged 15 to 29, 1,062 (52.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 225 (11.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 94.4% European/Pākehā, 12.4% Māori, 1.0% Pacific peoples, 1.3% Asian, and 2.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 15.1, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 60.2% had no religion, 29.7% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.1% were Buddhist and 0.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 273 (17.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 252 (15.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $36,800, compared with $31,800 nationally. 309 people (19.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 915 (57.1%) people were employed full-time, 276 (17.2%) were part-time, and 42 (2.6%) were unemployed.

==Kaimai Tunnel==
The Kaimai Railway Tunnel runs for nearly nine kilometres under the range, making it the longest tunnel in New Zealand. Construction of the tunnel started from both sides of the range in 1969: the headings met in 1976 and the tunnel opened on 12 September 1978. The Kaimai Range and this tunnel led to a Silver Fern railcar service between Auckland and Tauranga being named the Kaimai Express. This service operated from 1991 until 2001.

A peak of the Kaimai directly above the tunnel, previously unnamed, was named Stokes Peak in 2010 in honour of geographer Evelyn Stokes.

==Flight 441 disaster==
At approximately 9:09 am on 3 July 1963 the DC-3 Skyliner ZK-AYZ Hastings operating New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441 from Whenuapai Airport, Auckland to Tauranga crashed into the range. All 23 aboard died, making it the worst air disaster in mainland New Zealand.

==Communications==
The New Zealand Post Office engineering division (radio) built and maintained a microwave communications facility near the top of Kaimai range, close to the Hamilton–Tauranga highway saddle. In the 1960s it was a Lenkurt relay as part of the national network, linking Sanitorium Hill near Cambridge to Rotorua, with a spur to Tauranga. It now has cell phone and various other radio communications facilities, and is owned and operated by Telecom New Zealand. Land Parcel: Part Section 126 Block II Tapapa SD 

The New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) commissioned a television broadcast relay station atop Mount Te Aroha in 1963, relaying Auckland&#x27;s AKTV2 channel (now part of TVNZ 1) to Hamilton and Tauranga. Today, Mount Te Aroha is the main television transmitter and one of two main FM radio transmitters (along with Ruru) serving the Waikato.

Airways New Zealand maintains a secondary surveillance radar and ADS-B installation on &quot;Te Weraiti&quot;, a peak on the Kaimai range, 5 kilometers north of the State Highway 29 saddle. This is used to facilitate air traffic control.

<doc id="330913" wikidata="Q7766363" url="?curid=330913" title="The State (American TV series)">
<text>The State is an American sketch comedy television series originally broadcast on MTV from 1994 to 1995. The show combined bizarre characters and scenarios to present sketches that won the favor of its target teenaged audience. The cast consisted of comedy troupe The State, who were 11 comedians who created, acted, wrote, directed and edited the show. In various combinations, the former members of The State have continued to collaborate over the years, with alumni playing major creative, directing and acting roles in a number of notable projects including &quot;Reno 911!&quot; and &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;.

Several memorable characters were created for the show, and for a short time their catchphrases entered into the vernacular. Often, the cast would appear as themselves and address the audience to promote fake contests or to deliver mock public service announcements. Much like &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;The State&quot;&#x27;s sketches were sometimes linked to each other in some way: a punchline or image that ended one sketch often provided a lead-in to the next.

After years of legal issues related to the soundtrack to many of the episodes, the series was released on DVD on July 14, 2009. A &quot;State&quot; film featuring all of the original troupe members was planned, but faced delays due to the 2007–2008 screenwriters strike, and the project never came to fruition.

==About the show==

&quot;Contrary to popular belief&quot;, says the troupe&#x27;s official FAQ, &quot;the show was never canceled.&quot; For a variety of reasons, including network television politics, &quot;The State&quot; decided to pursue other interests and &quot;establish ourselves as an entity that exists apart from any particular employer or TV Network.&quot; However, CBS optioned to buy the show after its second year on MTV in hopes of increasing viewership among younger demographics and potentially providing competition against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. CBS intended to test the waters with &quot;The State&#x27;s 43rd Annual All-Star Halloween Special&quot;, which aired in prime time in 1995. The special received generally good reviews (including some from critics that gave them harsh ones earlier), but due to little promotion, it received low ratings. The show was not picked up for further broadcasts. On the series&#x27; DVD commentary, cast members revealed that MTV had offered a contract guarantee for 65 additional shows, but the cast turned it down to leave to CBS, against their agent&#x27;s advice.

==Episodes==

==Reviews==
&quot;The State&quot; received mixed reviews from critics during its original run. In January 1994, the &quot;Daily News&quot; TV guide called the show &quot;so terrible it deserves to be studied&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the show &quot;significantly less than sporadically funny&quot; and gave it a C− rating.

The show has fared better with critics in the years since it went off the air, however; TV.com says many of &quot;The State&quot;&#x27;s &quot;sketches remain funny to this day and — unlike most shows of the age — would not be considered dated or stale... Even the few mediocre sketches on the show are better than 99% of today&#x27;s sketch comedy.&quot;

== Cast ==

* Kevin Allison
* Michael Ian Black
* Ben Garant
* Todd Holoubek
* Michael Patrick Jann
* Kerri Kenney
* Thomas Lennon
* Joe Lo Truglio
* Ken Marino
* Michael Showalter
* David Wain

== Theme song ==
The opening sequence was set to &quot;Boys and Girls – Action&quot; by Craig Wedren of Shudder To Think and Eli Janney of Girls Against Boys. The song is built around samples of The Nation of Ulysses songs &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven Must Be Taken By Storm&quot; (&quot;Boys and girls!&quot;) and &quot;The Hickey Underworld&quot; (&quot;Action! Action!&quot;).

== Recurring characters==
The cast (notably David Wain) have said that they were not interested in creating recurring characters, but were repeatedly pressured by the network to emulate &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in this manner. In turn, some of the recurring characters were made as satires of recurring characters (notably, &quot;Louie&quot; was made to satisfy network pressures for both a recurring character and catch-phrases, according to the casts&#x27; DVD commentary track).

== Home media ==
The first season of &quot;The State&quot;, digitally re-mastered along with a new musical score, was made available on Apple’s iTunes Store on September 26, 2006. Several episodes were also made available on Amazon Unbox as well as the Xbox Live Marketplace.

A DVD box set was released July 2009.

<text>The DIN connector is an electrical signal connector that was standardized by the (DIN), the German Institute for Standards, in the mid 1950s, initially with 3 pins for mono, but when stereo connections and gear appeared in late 1950s (1959 or so), versions with 5 pins or more were launched. The male DIN connectors (plugs) feature a 13.2 mm diameter metal shield with a notch that limits the orientation in which plug and socket can mate. The range of DIN connectors, different only in the configuration of the pins, have been standardized as DIN 41524 / IEC/DIN EN 60130-9 (3-pin at 90° and 5-pin at 45°); DIN 45322 (5-pin and 6-pin at 60°); DIN 45329 / IEC/DIN EN 60130–9 (7-pin at 45°); and DIN 45326 / IEC/DIN EN 60130-9 (8-pin at 45°).

In consumer electronics, the term &quot;DIN connector&quot; identifies types of cylindrical connectors that the German Institute for Standards (DIN) had initially standardised for analog audio signals. Some DIN connectors have been used in analog video applications, for power connections, and for digital interfaces, such as the MIDI (DIN 41524), the IBM PC keyboard and the IBM AT keyboard connectors (DIN 41524). The original, technical standards for these models of DIN connector are unavailable, and were replaced with equivalent connectors, such as the international standard IEC 60130-9.

== Standards ==

The term &quot;DIN connector&quot; alone does not unambiguously identify any particular type of connector unless the document number of the relevant DIN standard is added (e.g., &quot;&quot;DIN 45322&quot; connector&quot;). Some DIN connector standards are:

* DIN 41524, for circular connectors often used for audio signals or some digital signals like MIDI
* DIN 41612, rectangular connectors used to connect plug-in cards to a back plane or motherboard
* DIN 41652 D-subminiature connectors used for computer data and video
* DIN 41585 automotive coaxial connectors

== Circular connectors ==

The plugs consist of a circular shielding metal skirt protecting a number of straight round pins. The pins are 1.45 mm in diameter and equally spaced (at 90°, 72°, 60° or 45° angles) in a 7.0 mm diameter circle. The skirt is keyed to ensure that the plug is inserted with the correct orientation, and to prevent damage to the pins. The basic design also ensures that the shielding is connected between socket and plug prior to any signal path connection being made.

There are seven common patterns, with any number of pins from three to eight. Three different five-pin connectors exist, known as 180°, 240°, and domino/360°/270° after the angle of the arc swept between the first and last pin. There are also two variations of the six-pin, seven-pin (one where the outer pins form 300° or 360° and one where they form 270°), and eight-pin (one where the outer pins form 270° and one where they form 262°) connectors.

There is some limited compatibility; for example, a three-pin connector will fit any 180° five-pin socket, engaging three of the pins and leaving the other two unconnected; and a three-pin or 180° five-pin connector will also fit a 270° seven-pin or either eight-pin socket.

In addition to these connectors, there are also connectors with 10, 12, and 14 pins. Some high-range equipment used seven-pin connectors where the outer two carried digital system data: if the connected equipment was incompatible, the outer two pins could be unscrewed from plugs so that they fitted into standard five-pin 180° sockets without data connections.

As the keying is consistent across all connectors, it does not completely prevent incompatible connectors from mating, which can lead to damage; this is changed in Mini-DIN, which keys different connectors.

Some &quot;domino&quot; five-pin connectors had a keyway on opposing sides of the socket, allowing it to be reversed. If used as a headphone connector, the plug sometimes had a cut-out in the body that, depending on which way the plug was inserted, would either allow (e.g.) external speakers to be switched off or not as required: inserting the plug one way would activate a switch on the periphery of the socket (thus switching off the speakers), whereas inserting the plug in the opposite orientation would not activate the switch (due to the cut-out in the plug body)—the left and right channels would not be transposed, as the plug was wired such that each headphone speaker was connected &quot;top left–bottom right&quot; and &quot;top right–bottom left&quot;. Note that when rotating a DIN headphone connector 180 degrees the polarity will be reversed. This generally doesn&#x27;t affect the audio but if an adapter with a DIN headphone male connector and most other types of female headphone connector is used, the negative connection for both channels will be joined resulting in the audio being stereo with the DIN connector inserted one way and mono when inserted the other way. To avoid this and still be able to use a pair of headphones both with equipment that has a DIN headphone connector and also use it with other equipment it is suggested to permanently mount a DIN connector on the headphones and make an adapter to use other devices with headphones that has a DIN connector. If used as a serial data connection, the transmit and receive lines could be crossed (although the pinout adopted by Acorn did not allow for this).

Screw-locking versions of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control, and professional audio. In North America, this variant is often called a &quot;small Tuchel&quot; connector after one of the major manufacturers, now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a bayonet locking ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines, and lighting dimmers and controls through from the 1960s to the 1980s, an example being the microphone input connector and some others on the &quot;Report&quot; family of Uher tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the &quot;Bleecon&quot;, an example of its use being the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon, or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.

== Applications ==

=== Analog audio ===

The 3/180° and 5/180° connectors were originally standardized and widely used in European countries for interconnecting analog audio equipment. For example, a stereo tape recorder could connect to a stereo amplifier using the five pins for the four signal connections plus ground. The connectors on the cord are connected pin for pin, (pin 1 to pin 1, etc.). Pins on male connectors are numbered (from right to left, viewed from outside of the connector, with the five pins upwards, and facing them): 1–4–2–5–3. Holes on female connectors are also numbered 1-4-2-5-3, but from left to right (facing the holes). The three pins that make contact with a 3 pin DIN connector will have the same pin numbering both in the three-pin and the five-pin connector. A four-conductor cord wired in this way is sometimes called a &quot;DIN cord&quot;, a &quot;DIN lead&quot; or a &quot;DIN cable&quot;. For mono interconnections, the 3/180° plugs are sufficient. When a mono plug is inserted into a stereo socket, it mates with the left channel. For playback only interconnections, the 3/180° plugs are sufficient, with pin 1 and 3 used for the stereo channels and pin 2 as signal ground. Five-pin DIN inputs for record players and auxiliary signal sources commonly join pin 1 and 5 in order to be compatible both with the 3/180° and 5/180° pinouts. This generally works fine. However the join of pin 1 and 5 on adapters between DIN and RCA connectors can cause problems if used with a five-pin DIN connector tape connector on an amplifier or receiver, as it will join the left record with right playback signal. The other way around is usually not a problem as sending the right playback out of a tape recorder back in to the left record input usually imposes no problem in playback mode.

The signal levels are generally in the low range of line levels for playback/reproduction signals. The levels for recording can be considerably lower, more like microphone levels in some cases.

Some manufacturers, like Philips, Uher and others, did use the connector slightly differently for tape recorders. Pin 2 (signal ground) was the same as others, and in playback mode pin 3 and 5 were used for left and right line level output as others. However in record mode all pins were active inputs, with pin 1 and 4 for low-level signals like microphone levels, while pin 3 and 5 were used for line-level signals. On all these recorders the output signals were only active in play mode, not in stop, record, rewind, fast forward or any other mode. The main benefits with this usage is that tape copying can be done with the regular pin-to-pin connected cables commonly used to connect tape recorders to amplifiers/receivers. An additional benefit is that several tape recorders can be connected in parallel, and can also be connected to an amplifier/receiver. Copying is done simply by pressing play on the playback recorder, rec on any recorders used for recording, and the amplifier/receiver is either switched off or set to the tape position. Recording of radio broadcasts or records is equally simple, just press record on any recorder and do not set any other recorder to playback mode. This eliminates the need for any switch boxes otherwise commonly used to connect more than one tape recorder to a single tape recorder connector on an amplifier/receiver. The drawbacks were that connecting any mono recorder with pin 1 joined to 4 and pin 5 joined to 3 (a common practice to make mono recorders record both channels in parallel and reproduce in both channels) would make all tape sounds mono. Also any tape recorder with three heads, used for monitoring while recording, needs an extra lead between the recorder and the amplifier to be able to monitor the recording through the amplifier and speakers. On Philips amplifiers/receivers and three head recorders that extra socket is labeled Monitor while the regular socket is labeled Tape. Another drawback is the possible confusion when interconnecting with other equipment, where a person sometimes would use a straight pin-to-pin cable and sometimes use a special &quot;copying&quot; cable with pin 1 swapped with pin 3 and pin 4 swapped with pin 5. Sometimes a person would also need to lower the signal to make a line output fit a microphone level input. 

In other cases it was also used for sending power to a device. For example in some tuners, usually only pins 1, 4 and 2 are required for audio signal. (3 and 5 were used to supply power to the tuner U usually DC, as AC may cause hum, tuners usually having low power requirements). The input is still compatible with other standard input connectors, but misusing pins 3 and 5 may cause damage. Other manufacturers were using more than 5 pins, for example cassette decks, two other pins being for power supply. Usually these were proprietary connections, making them compatible only with decks of the same manufacturers. Some other manufacturers used more than 5 pin connections (7 or even 9 pins) for devices with remote control; besides the audio signals there was also a remote control link (usually the main unit with remote receiver being the amplifier/receiver). Also, some amplifiers and receivers with ceramic phono input used 1,4,2 pins for conventional line audio signal input and pins 3 and 5 for powering an optional external magnetic phono preamplifier. In this case, these manufacturers were also supplying the preamplifier. The input without preamplifier can be used as standard input on pins 1, 2 and 4, but care should be taken to avoid shorting pins 3 and 5, which in this case are power supply, which may cause damages to equipment. In other cases, pins 1, 2 and 4 are used for magnetic cartridge, and 3, 5 (with ground on 2 ) for ceramic. This depends on manufacturer. Other uses for example in case of cassette decks were: Input and output, power supply, remote control and record sync. This will usually work only with decks of the same manufacturer. Usually it will be compatible with conventional decks, but care must be taken not to short the other pins.

This interface was rare outside products for the European market, and has progressively disappeared on new equipment, both in Europe and worldwide, since the 1980s, in favour of RCA connectors. Non-European products intended for the European market commonly combined both DIN and RCA connectors, with cassette decks having both and amplifiers/receivers commonly having RCA connectors for everything and an additional 5-pin DIN connector for at least one tape connection, usually in parallel with a set of RCA connector for the same input/output.

=== Other uses ===

The 5/180° connectors are commonly used for:

* SYNC or MIDI interface for electronic musical instrument
* Peripherals or power connectors for personal computers from the 1980s
* Audio in the original HME wireless communicators (It is the headset connector for inbound and outbound audio for drive-through restaurants.)
* Controlling tilt of UMTS antennas (Antenna Interface Standards Group)
* Connecting two controllers for radio controlled model aircraft together for training purposes

The DIN connector saw several other uses apart from audio. It was particularly popular as a connector for various home computers and video game consoles.

Analogue theatrical lighting control (pre-dating the more recent digital control protocols such as DMX) commonly used the 8-pin (45°) DIN connector, six of the pins being 0–10 V control signals for six separate dimmer circuits, and the other two a 0 V reference and a DC source for powering simple circuitry in rudimentary lighting desks. Pinouts vary between manufacturers: Zero 88, Anytronics, Lightprocessor and Strand have the control signals on pins 1–6, 0 V on pin 8 and power on pin 7 and Pulsar and Clay Paky have power on pin 1, 0 V on pin 2 and channel outputs on pins 3 to 8. The polarity of the power supply and control signals relative to ground also varies, with Strand having negative voltages, but most other brands having positive voltages.

== Other designs ==
A polarised two-pin unshielded connector, designed for connecting a loudspeaker to a power amplifier (or other device; many of the earlier shoebox style tape recorders used them), is known as the DIN 41529 loudspeaker connector. It commonly exists as a panel-mounting female version, and line-mounted male and female versions, although there were rare panel mounted male connectors, for example fitted on the external speaker boxes on certain early 1980s Luxor TV sets. The male version has a central flat pin, and circular pin mounted off-centre. The circular pin is connected to the positive line (red) while the spade is connected to the negative line (black). The panel-mounting female version is available with or without an auxiliary contact that disconnects the internal speaker of the device if an external speaker connector is inserted. Most common is a three-hole female connector with one circular hole on either side of the spade hole, one of them with an aux contact and one without, which provides the option to leave the internal speaker connected by inserting the plug twisted by 180°.

Many European car radio/stereo brands used this connector, commonly spaced so close apart that you need smaller male cable connectors. This was commonly used in conjunction with a connector block with two larger and four smaller flat blade connectors with a standardized pinout for power in (main power, memory for radios with electronic settings memory, dashboard light power) and out (for an automatic electric antenna). This setup was commonly combined with an 8-pin DIN connector where pin 1-5 were used for line output for connecting power amplifier (using the same pinout as for home audio equipment, except &quot;tape record&quot; would be front audio out and &quot;tape play&quot; would be rear audio out). The middle pin was used for remote start of an amplifier. If standard 5-pin home audio cables were used the automatic antenna connector could also be used for remote starting an amplifier. Eventually this connector setup was replaced with the later ISO car stereo connector standard.

It is now mainly found on older equipment, such as 16 mm movie projectors.. The connector is used on some LED lamps and halogen lamps to connect the bulb to the power supply. The two-pin DIN plug lacks the outer metal shell, so far less force is required to disconnect the plug accidentally. There are also three- and four-pin versions of this loudspeaker connector, used for example by Bang &amp; Olufsen.

<text>Leptacinus intermedius is a European rove beetle, described in 1935 by Horace Donisthorpe. Like most staphylinids, &quot;L. intermedius&quot; and its larvae are predatory upon other insects. Members of this family can usually be identified by their very short elytra, which leave three to six abdominal segments exposed. The beetle can also be identified by the size of the aedeagus in males.

<doc id="330919" wikidata="Q2598667" url="?curid=330919" title="Subaru BRAT">
<text>The Subaru BRAT (acronym for &quot;Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter&quot;) is a light-duty, four-wheel drive coupé utility, version of the Subaru Leone. It was sold from 1978 until 1994, introduced following the concept of coupe utilities such as the Chevrolet El Camino and the Ford Ranchero. The BRAT is also known as a Brumby, MV Pickup or Shifter depending on where it was sold. 

==Technical==
All BRAT&#x27;s had four-wheel drive and the Subaru EA engine. Early models received the 1.6 litre EA-71, whereas 1981 and later models received a 1.8 litre EA-81 engine. The 1983 and 1984 models could be purchased with an optional turbocharged engine. Manual transmissions were standard on all models, and an automatic transmission was available on turbocharged BRAT&#x27;s. The 1980 and earlier models had a single-range transfer case, while 1981 and later GL models had a dual-range transfer case (DL&#x27;s still had single range), and all turbocharged models were equipped with a 3 speed automatic transmission with a single-range, push-button, four-wheel drive.
== First generation ==

Developed in Japan in 1977 at the request of the President of Subaru of America, the BRAT was introduced to match the demand for small trucks in North America, in order to compete against other manufacturers, such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda. Unlike trucks from other manufacturers, all BRATs had four-wheel drive, as they were developed from the existing Leone station wagon. When the Leone was redesigned in 1979 for the 1980 model year, the BRAT continued with the original Gen I body until 1982.

===Jump seats===
North American and Canadian BRAT models featured carpeting in addition to welded-in rear-facing plastic jump seats in the cargo area. The seats were a ploy to circumvent a punitive tariff on light trucks known as the Chicken tax. The plastic seats in the cargo bed allowed Subaru to classify the BRAT as a passenger car, rather than as a light truck. This significantly reduced the costs of importing BRATS to North America, as passenger cars were charged a 2.5% import tariff, while light trucks were charged a ten times higher 25% import tariff. They were discontinued after the 1986 model year.


== Second generation ==

The BRAT was restyled in 1981 and the jump seats were discontinued after the 1985 model year. The BRAT was re-introduced with a rise in popularity of small trucks being sold in the United States, primarily from Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda. Production continued into 1994 but ceased to be imported to North America in 1987. It was also known as the Brumby in Australia and New Zealand and the MV Pickup / Shifter in the UK. Imports to Europe, Australia (from 1978), and New Zealand continued until February 1994. The BRAT was not sold in Japan and was manufactured for export markets.

===Features===
The early 1980s saw the introduction of a second Gen Targa-Top version. It also had other features, such as: a spring-loaded hidden door, for a side step into the cargo bed; and a spare tire mounted under the hood.

In Australia there were specialty features: Ag-quip / packages with graphics, Roo bar, sump guard &amp; rear step bar. Wagon wheels were also optional.

==Manufacture==
It was an export-only model, never being officially sold in Japan. Due to this, the BRAT became a popular grey import vehicle in Japan.

There were several locations that manufactured the vehicle:

Subaru never considered marketing the BRAT in their home market, due to a truncating demand of pickup trucks that had been occurring since the late 1970s. The declining demand came as a result of Japanese customers shifting to station wagons at that time.

In 1987, exports to North America ceased, but exports to Europe, Australia, Latin America, and New Zealand continued until 1994.

==Notable owners==
President Ronald Reagan owned a 1978 BRAT until 1998, which he kept at his ranch near Santa Barbara, California. The vehicle has since been restored and returned to the ranch, which is now owned by the Young America&#x27;s Foundation.

== Motorsport ==
There have been several private enterprises that have used the BRAT / Brumby / MV Pickup in Motorsport events:
* 2014: Settlement Creek—Brumby desert racer.
* 2018: Freddie Flintoff chose a 1985 BRAT during an electric vehicle challenge on Top Gear series 27. Unlike the other vehicles, Flintoff kept the petrol engine in situ, as well as installing a Tesla power-plant.
* 2020: 1988 Drag Brumby—fastest EJ powered vehicle.

== Future concepts ==
There were no third generation BRAT/Brumby/MV pickups as the range was discontinued after 1987 in the United States. In Australia, the range was continued until 1994.

Subaru did, however, reveal a concept pickup in 1993 called the Suiren and later on in 2002, the automaker released a similar pickup vehicle called the Baja.

<text>Cachexia () is a syndrome that happens when people have certain illnesses, causing muscle loss that cannot be fully reversed with improved nutrition. It is most common in diseases like cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and AIDS. These conditions change how the body handles inflammation, metabolism, and brain signaling, leading to muscle loss and other harmful changes to body composition over time. Unlike weight loss from not eating enough, cachexia mainly affects muscle and can happen with or without fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia is difficult because there are no clear guidelines, and its occurrence varies from one affected person to the next.

Like malnutrition, cachexia can lead to worse health outcomes and lower quality of life.

==Definition==
Cachexia is hard to define because it often happens alongside malnutrition and sarcopenia. Since there are no clear rules separating these conditions, experts continue working to agree on definitions to help treat these nutrition-related problems.

In the past, cachexia was described as &quot;a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass.&quot; In 2011, experts updated this definition, saying cachexia is &quot;a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment.&quot; They also suggested breaking it into three stages: pre-cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia.

===Cachexia and Malnutrition ===
Cachexia and malnutrition are related but not the same. Malnutrition happens when the body doesn&#x27;t get enough nutrients, leading to changes in body weight, physical strength, and mental function. Malnutrition includes both disease-related malnutrition as well as malnutrition without disease such as seen in starvation or aging. Cachexia should be viewed as a type of malnutrition in which inflammation from a long-term illness causes unwanted muscle loss.

===Cachexia and Sarcopenia ===
Cachexia and sarcopenia are similar because both cause weight and muscle loss, along with symptoms like weakness and loss of appetite. The difference is sarcopenia is caused by aging, while cachexia happens due to long-term disease and inflammation.

==Causes==

Cachexia is most commonly associated end-stage cancer, often called &quot;cancer cachexia.&quot;

Other conditions that frequently cause cachexia include:

* Congestive heart failure
* AIDS
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Chronic kidney disease

Cachexia can happen in late stages of diseases like cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia, tuberculosis, multiple system atrophy, mercury poisoning, Crohn&#x27;s disease, trypanosomiasis, rheumatoid arthritis,celiac disease, and other diseases that effect the entire body.

==Mechanism==

The way cachexia works is not well understood, but research suggests it is linked to inflammation, changes in metabolism, and hormone changes in the body .

=== Inflammatory ===
Certain molecules in the body, called Inflammatory cytokines, play a big role in causing cachexia. Two important ones are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).

==== Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) ====
TNF breaks down muscle and fat while stopping new muscle and fat cells from forming by activating the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. It also triggers the release of other cytokines that also speed up muscle loss. Since this process is very complex, cachexia is unlikely to be caused by one molecule. While it is thought to be produced by immune cells called macrophages, scientists are still unsure of exactly where TNF is produced in cachexia.

==== Interleukin-6 (IL-6) ====
IL-6 is thought to cause muscle loss by starting a pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway. IL-6 is produced by immune cells called macrophages, potentially producing acute phase reactants which may worsen muscle loss.

Other molecules may include:

* Myostatin - Prevents muscle growth and is often higher in people with cancer.
* Activin - May contribute to muscle loss when TNF is also active.
* Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15) - Normally produced during cellular stress. Thought to play a role in food aversion and is associated with reduced food intake.

=== Metabolic ===
Cachexia can also result from changes in metabolism. Tumors sometimes release molecules that break down fat and muscle, causing cachexia by making it harder for the body to keep up with energy needs. These molecules include lipid mobilizing factor, proteolysis-inducing factor, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. In addition, uncontrolled inflammation in people with cachexia increases the body&#x27;s need for nutrients.

The way the body uses nutrients is also changed in cachexia. People with cachexia can have loss of appetite, are less responsive to insulin, and can have increased fat breakdown, all of which make it difficult for the body to properly use food. This is especially true in people with cancer.

=== Hormonal ===
Hormones are signaling molecules used to regulate bodily behavior and are believed to play a role in cachexia as well.

Glucocorticoids are produced as part of the body&#x27;s natural response to stress. They are also known to play a role in muscle breakdown. Furthermore, people with long-term illness such as cancer are frequently treated with glucocorticoids, making cachexia more likely in these individuals.

Some tumors produce a molecule called parathyroid-related peptide (PTHrP). It increases metabolism by stimulating energy production in the mitochondria of fat cells.

Leptin is a hormone known to decrease appetite. People with cachexia often have high leptin levels, making them feel less hungry.

The hypothalamus, the brain&#x27;s appetite control center, is also affected in cachexia. Given the hypothalamic function in controlling appetite, it is believed to play a role in cachexia. The appetite-controlling center of the hypothalamus is controlled by neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti gene-related protein (AgRP) that increase appetite, as well as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcrip (CART) that decrease appetite. Inflammation may disrupt these appetite signals, causing reduced hunger and leading to further weight and muscle loss. However, scientists are still studying exactly how this process works.

==Diagnosis==

=== Previous Criteria for Diagnosing Cachexia ===
Doctors used to diagnose cachexia mainly by looking at changes in body weight. A person was considered to have cachexia if they had a low BMI or unwanted weight loss of more than 10%. However, only using weight is not always a reliable method. Factors like fluid buildup (edema), tumor size, and obesity can make it difficult to diagnose cachexia. These weight-based criteria do not account for muscle loss, which is a key part in cachexia. .

To improve diagnosis of cachexia, experts proposed adding lab tests and symptom evaluations. With that, a person might have cachexia if they lost at least 5% of their in 12 months or had a BMI under less 22 kg/m2 with at least three of the following: weak muscles, fatigue, loss of appetite, low muscle mass, or abnormal labs.

There have also been attempts to define specific types of cachexia, such as cardiac cachexia, which can occur in people with congestive heart failure. However, there is no widely accepted definition for it.

===Current Criteria for Diagnosing Cachexia ===
Cancer cachexia is now diagnosed based on:

# Unwanted weight loss of more than 5% within 6 months. 
# For people with a BMI of less than 20 kg/m2, weight loss of more than 2%. 
# For people with sarcopenia, weight loss of more than 2%. 
New ways to score and stage cachexia are being explored, particularly in people with advanced cancer.

==== Scoring systems for Cachexia ====
To better understand how bad cachexia is in each person, doctors now use scoring systems like the Cachexia Staging Score and Cachexia Score.

The &quot;Cachexia Staging Score (CSS)&quot; looks at weight loss, muscle function, appetite loss, and lab test results to categorize people into four stages: non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia. Those in more advanced stages have less muscle mass, more frequent age-related muscle loss, worse symptoms, poorer quality of life, as well as shorter survival periods.

==== Staging ====

* Non-cachexia (0-2 points) - No major weight loss or problems with appetite.
* Pre-cachexia (3-4 points) - Mild weight loss and appetite issues. Early treatment at this stage might slow progression of cachexia.
* Cachexia (5-8 points) - Significant muscle loss that is difficult to reverse and affects daily function.
* Refractory cachexia (9-12 points) - Severe weight and muscle loss with poor response to treatment and a life expectancy of less than 3 months.

The &quot;Cachexia SCOre (CASCO)&quot; is another scoring system that looks at weight loss, inflammation, metabolism, immune function, physical ability, appetite, and quality of life to provide a more detailed assessment.

=== Laboratory Tests for Cachexia ===
Laboratory tests are sometimes used to check for cachexia. Tests that are used include albumin, C-reactive protein, ghrelin, IGF-2, and leptin. Acute phase reactants (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor, IL-8, interferon gamma and serum cytokines are also studied but are not always reliable for predicting cachexia. Laboratory cut-off values are also not the same across different institutions. There is no single lab test that can confirm cachexia or predict who will develop it.

=== Imaging ===
One challenge in diagnosing cachexia is measuring muscle loss in an easy and affordable way. Some imaging techniques that can help assess body composition include:

* Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
* Computed tomography (CT scans)
* Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

However, these methods are not widely used because they can be expensive and difficult to access.

==Treatment==

Because cachexia is a complex condition with several potential causes, treatment requires multiple approaches at the same time. The best strategy is to treat the cause of the cachexia, if known. For example, people with cachexia caused by AIDS often improve after starting treatment for AIDS. However, because the exact mechanism of cachexia is unclear, there is no single medication that can effectively treat it. Instead, treatment focuses on a combination of exercise, nutrition, medications, and psychosocial support.

===Exercise===

Regular physical exercise is recommended for the treatment of cachexia because of its positive effects on muscle function. Exercise can reduce protein breakdown, improve muscle strength, decrease inflammation, and enhance metabolism. However, its effectiveness in cancer patients - especially those who are frail or have sarcopenia - remains uncertain. Many people with cachexia also avoid exercise because they lack motivation or fear that it will worsen their symptoms.

===Nutrition===
Cachexia can increase metabolism and suppress appetite, worsening the present muscle loss. Studies show that high-calorie, protein-rich diets may help stabilize weight, though they do not necessarily improve muscle mass. Current recommendations include 1.5g/kg/day of protein, making up 15-20% of daily calories. However, feeding tubes (enteral nutrition) should not be used routinely.

===Medications===
Some medications, such as glucocorticoids, cannabinoids, and progestins were initially used in treating cachexia and aim to increase appetite. Progestins showed promise initially, but they do not stop muscle wasting and may cause fluid retention, fat gain, and other side effects.

Ghrelin agonists, such as Anamorelin are commonly used in cancer treatment to boost appetite, increase weight, and increase muscle mass. However, its use and effectiveness in cachexia is not well studied.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) such as Enobosarm show promise in increasing physical performance and muscle mass, but more studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness in cachexia.

The use of anti-inflammatory medications have been investigated. Thalidomide, an anti-inflammatory agent, has shown promise in preventing weight loss, but the use of this medication in cachexia is not widely accepted. However, other TNF inhibitors have not shown the same promising results. NSAIDs such as celecoxib and ibuprofen showed some early benefits, but side effects (renal injury, GI bleeding) limit their use.

Anti-nausea drugs such as 5-HT3 antagonists are also commonly used if nausea is a prominent symptom.

Anabolic steroids like oxandrolone may help but are only recommended for short term use due to side effects including liver toxicity.

=== Supplements ===
The use of certain amino acids may slow muscle breakdown by providing the body with the building blocks needed for metabolism of muscle and glucose. Specifically, leucine and valine may block muscle breakdown. Glutamine is used in oral supplements for people with advanced cancer or HIV/AIDS.

β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a molecule that comes from leucine that promotes muscle growth. Studies show positive results for chronic pulmonary disease, hip fracture, and in AIDS-related and cancer-related cachexia. However, it is often studied along with other nutrients, making it difficult to assess its effects alone.

Creatine supplementation may help reduce muscle wasting, though more research is needed.

==Epidemiology==
Accurate epidemiological data on the prevalence of cachexia is lacking due to changing diagnostic criteria and under-identification of people with the disorder. It is estimated that cachexia from any disease is estimated to affect more than 5 million people in the United States. The prevalence of cachexia is growing and estimated at 1% of the population. The prevalence is lower in Asia but due to the larger population, represents a similar burden. Cachexia is also a significant problem in South America and Africa.

Within people with cancer, prevalence of cachexia was previously reported to range from 11%-71%. Recent updates show that 33%-51.8% of people with cancer develop cachexia, though current estimates of prevalence vary widely and may be unreliable due to absence of consensus guidelines for diagnosis, variability in cancer populations, and variability in timing of diagnosis. Specifically, the highest rates were seen in older populations as well as those with upper gastrointestinal, colorectal, and lung cancers, respectively. The prevalence increases in advanced cancer stages, affecting up to 80% of terminal cancer cases.

The most frequent diseases causing cachexia in the United States are: 1) Cancer , 2) chronic heart failure, 3) chronic kidney disease, 4) COPD.

Cachexia contributes to significant loss of function and healthcare utilization. Estimates suggest that cachexia accounted for 177,640 hospital stays in 2016 in the United States. Cachexia is considered the immediate cause of death of many people with cancer, estimated between 22 and 40%.

==History==
The word &quot;cachexia&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;&quot;Kakos&quot; (bad) and &quot;hexis&quot;&quot; (condition). English ophthalmologist John Zachariah Laurence was the first to use the phrase &quot;cancerous cachexia&quot;, doing so in 1858. He applied the phrase to the chronic wasting associated with malignancy. It was not until 2011 that the term &quot;cancer-associated cachexia&quot; was given a formal definition, with a publication by Kenneth Fearon. Fearon defined it as &quot;a multifactorial syndrome characterized by ongoing loss of skeletal muscle (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment&quot;.

==Research==
Several medications are under investigation or have been previously trialed for use in cachexia but are currently not in widespread clinical use:

* Thalidomide
* Cytokine antagonists
* Cannabinoids 
* Omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
* Prokinetics 
* Ghrelin and ghrelin receptor agonist 
* Anabolic catabolic transforming agents such as MT-102 
* Selective androgen receptor modulators
* Cyproheptadine 
* Hydrazine sulfate

Medical marijuana has been allowed for the treatment of cachexia in some US states, such as Missouri, Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, Nevada, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Vermont, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maine, and New York Hawaii and Connecticut.

===Multimodal therapy===
Despite the extensive investigation into single therapeutic targets for cachexia, the most effective treatments use multi-targeted therapies. In Europe, a combination of non-drug approaches including physical training, nutritional counseling, and psychotherapeutic intervention are used in belief this approach may be more effective than monotherapy. Administration of anti-inflammatory drugs showed efficacy and safety in the treatment of people with advanced cancer cachexia.

<text>GMC (formerly the General Motors Truck Company (1911–1943), or the GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division (1943–1998)) is a division of American automotive manufacturer General Motors (GM) for trucks and utility vehicles. GMC currently makes SUVs, pickup trucks, vans, and light-duty trucks. In the past, GMC also produced fire trucks, ambulances, heavy-duty trucks, military vehicles, motorhomes, transit buses, and medium duty trucks.

While many of their vehicles are mechanically similar, GMC is positioned as a premium offering to the mainstream Chevrolet brand, and includes the luxury trim Denali. In North America, GMC vehicles are almost always sold alongside Buick (another premium brand) vehicles at multi-brand dealerships.

== History ==
Roots to the GMC brand can be traced to 1900, when the &quot;Grabowsky Motor Company&quot; was established by brothers Max (1874-1946) and Morris Grabowsky, in Detroit, and renamed Rapid Motor Vehicle Company in 1902 when the brothers moved operations to Pontiac, Michigan. In 1909, William C. Durant gained control of Rapid Motor Vehicle Company and made it a subsidiary of his General Motors Company.

In 1911, General Motors formed the &quot;General Motors Truck Company&quot; and folded Rapid and Reliance Motor Car Company (another early commercial vehicle manufacturer that Durant had acquired in 1908) into it. In 1912, the Rapid and Reliance names were dropped in favor of &quot;GMC&quot;. All General Motors truck production was consolidated at the former Rapid Motor Plant 1 in Pontiac, Michigan.

GMC maintained three manufacturing locations in Pontiac, Michigan, Oakland, California, and St. Louis, Missouri .
In 1916, a GMC truck crossed the country from Seattle to New York City in thirty days, and in 1926, a 2-ton GMC truck was driven from New York to San Francisco in five days and 30 minutes. During the First World War, the company provided the Model 16 3/4-ton truck, and modified its production to provide 1-ton troop carriers and aviation support vehicles, and by 1918, more than 90 percent of GMC truck production was for military use. GMTC provided a total of 8,512 trucks to the U.S. government during the war years and earned a Distinguished Service Award. During the Second World War, GMC Truck produced 600,000 trucks for use by the United States Armed Forces.

In 1923, GMC trucks were exported to Japan to help recovery and reconstruction as a result of the Great Kantō earthquake, and the company continued to provide vehicles as the transportation infrastructure was rebuilt. Before the earthquake struck, most of Japan&#x27;s transportation of commerce and people was by wooden carts and government owned railroads, which were severely damaged when the train tracks were twisted beyond use. Autonomous trucks were much more effective at traveling to heavily damaged areas.
In 1925, GM purchased a controlling interest in Yellow Coach, a bus and taxicab manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois which was founded by John D. Hertz. The company was renamed Yellow Truck &amp; Coach Manufacturing Company (YT&amp;CMC), an affiliated subsidiary of General Motors. All manufacturing operations of General Motors Truck Company were placed under YT&amp;CMC. In 1928, Plant 2 opened and all headquarters staff moved to the administration building at 660 South Boulevard E in Pontiac, MI. In 1943, GM purchased the remaining interest in YT&amp;CMC and renamed it GMC Truck and Coach Division.

In 1981, GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division became part of GM Worldwide Truck &amp; Bus Group.
Bus production ended in May 1987 and the division name was changed from GMC Truck &amp; Coach to GMC Truck Division. The Canadian plant (in London, Ontario) produced buses from 1962 until July 1987. GM withdrew from the bus and coach market because of increased competition in the late 1970s and 1980s. Rights to the RTS model were sold to Transportation Manufacturing Corporation, while Motor Coach Industries of Canada purchased the Classic design. In 1998, GMC&#x27;s official branding on vehicles was shortened from &quot;GMC Truck&quot; to simply &quot;GMC&quot;. {citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In 1996, GM merged GMC Truck Division with the Pontiac Motor Division in order to &quot;give the combined division a brand image projecting physical power and outdoor activity&quot;. This coincided with many GMC dealerships merging with Pontiac dealerships, allowing a single dealer to offer both trucks and entry-to-mid-level cars, using a similar approach already in use by Chevrolet.

In 2002, GMC celebrated its 100th anniversary and released a book entitled &quot;GMC: The First 100 Years&quot;, a complete history of the company.

In 2007, GMC introduced the Acadia, a crossover SUV, which was the division&#x27;s second unibody vehicle (after the Vandura) whose predecessor, the GMT-360 based Envoy, was discontinued with the closure of GM&#x27;s Moraine, Ohio plant on December 23, 2008.

In 2009, GMC ended production of medium-duty commercial trucks after over 100 years. They became exclusive to Chevrolet with the launch of the 4500HD/5500HD Silverado in 2018. Also in 2009, GMC introduced the Terrain, a mid-size crossover SUV based on the GM Theta platform shared with the Chevrolet Equinox. It replaced the Pontiac Torrent after the brand&#x27;s demise.

In 2020, General Motors announced the return of the Hummer nameplate, this time as a sub-brand of GMC instead of a stand-alone division. The Hummer lineup includes two models, an electric pickup truck and SUV, to be sold as the &quot;GMC Hummer EV&quot;. According to GM, the Edition 1 production electric pickup truck will feature 1,000 horsepower, hit 60 mph in 3 seconds and is scheduled to launch in late 2021. The new Hummer EV was revealed on October 20, 2020.

In 2022, the GMC brand was introduced in South Korea as a subsidiary of GM Korea.

In 2025, the GMC brand was introduced in China.

==Platform sharing with Chevrolet==
Beginning in 1920, GMC and Chevrolet trucks became largely similar, built as variants of the same platform, sharing much the same body sheetwork, except for nameplates and grilles – though their differences, especially engines, have varied over the years. GMC advertising marketed its trucks to commercial buyers and businesses, whereas Chevrolet&#x27;s advertising was directed towards private owners. Beginning in 1928, GMCs used Pontiac&#x27;s 186 cu in six-cylinder engines in their lighter trucks. Medium-duty trucks relied on Oldsmobile straight-6 engines, while the heaviest trucks used GMC&#x27;s own &quot;Standard Big Brute&quot; engine. From 1939 to 1974, GMC had its own line of six-cylinder engines, first the inline sixes known as &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s&quot; from 1939 to 1959, and then their own V6 from 1960 until 1974, of which a V8 and a V12 version also existed. Additionally, from 1955 through 1959, the less than 2-ton, domestic GMC gasoline trucks were equipped with Pontiac V8s, and Oldsmobile V8s—whereas the Canadian models used Chevrolet engines. GMC dealerships were partnered with Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick dealerships.

Between 1962 and 1972, most GMC vehicles were equipped with quad-headlights, while their Chevrolet clones were equipped with dual-headlights. The platform has been the most profitable for General Motors, as it was shared with the Chevrolet Blazer/GMC Jimmy, the Chevrolet Suburban and the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Denali. In 1998, the platform was introduced as the Cadillac Escalade.

In 1971, GMC marketed their version of the Chevrolet El Camino, which was based on the Chevrolet Chevelle. Called Sprint, it was virtually identical to the El Camino, and a sport version, the SP, was equivalent to the El Camino SS. It was renamed Caballero in 1978, and remained produced alongside the El Camino until its demise in 1987.

In 1973, with GM&#x27;s introduction of the new &quot;rounded line&quot; series trucks, GMC and Chevrolet trucks became even more similar, ending production of GMC&#x27;s quad-headlight models, and setting the standard for the Chevrolet/GMC line of trucks for over thirty years.

, GMC&#x27;s vehicles were marketed as more premium, luxury vehicles positioned above similar vehicles from the more mainstream Chevrolet division. Chevrolet vehicles are priced lower than a comparable GMC, but GMC vehicles have features not found in a comparable Chevrolet.

In North America, Chevrolet offers a full lineup of cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks. GMC, however, does not offer any car models, so typically they are sold along Buick (or sometimes Cadillac) vehicles at multi-brand dealerships, allowing the same dealer to sell a full lineup of upscale vehicles, including both cars and trucks. However some standalone GMC dealerships do exist, primarily for dealers who have a focus on selling to the commercial and fleet vehicle markets.

<doc id="330943" wikidata="Q686600" url="?curid=330943" title="Red-billed tropicbird">
<text>The red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) is a tropicbird, one of three closely related species of seabird of tropical oceans. Superficially resembling a tern in appearance, it has mostly white plumage with some black markings on the wings and back, a black mask and, as its common name suggests, a red bill. Most adults have that are about two times their body length, with those in males being generally longer than those in females. The red-billed tropicbird itself has three subspecies recognized, including the nominate. The subspecies &quot;mesonauta&quot; is distinguished from the nominate by the rosy tinge of its fresh plumage, and the subspecies &quot;indicus&quot; can be differentiated by its smaller size, more restricted mask, and more orange bill. This species ranges across the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The nominate is found in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the subspecies &quot;indicus&quot; in the waters off of the Middle East and in the Indian Ocean, and the subspecies &quot;mesonauta&quot; in the eastern portions of both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and in the Caribbean. It was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

Nesting takes place in loose colonies, as they nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid and is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.

In some areas, introduced black and brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird. This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, this bird is considered to be threatened.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the red-billed tropicbird in the 17th century, having seen a specimen held by the Royal Society. It was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and still bears its original scientific name, &quot;Phaethon aethereus&quot;. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;phaethon&quot;, &quot;sun&quot; while the species name comes from Latin &quot;aetherius&quot;, &quot;heavenly&quot;. This bird is called the red-billed tropicbird due to its red bill and its location in the tropicbird genus. An alternative common name was &quot;bosun bird&quot;, also spelt &quot;boatswain bird&quot;, from the similarity of its shrill call to a boatswain&#x27;s whistle. An alternative derivation of the name is from the semblance of the tail feathers to marlin spikes. Local names used in the West Indies include &quot;truphit&quot;, &quot;trophic&quot;, &quot;white bird&quot;, &quot;paille-en-queue&quot;, &quot;paille-en-cul&quot;, &quot;flèche-en-cul&quot;, and &quot;fétu&quot;. In a 1945 paper, American ornithologist Waldo Lee McAtee proposed it be called the barred-backed tropicbird after its most distinguishing feature.

The red-billed tropicbird is basal (the earliest offshoot) in the genus &quot;Phaethon&quot;, the sole extant genus in the family Phaethontidae, the tropicbirds. The split between this tropicbird and the other tropicbirds, the red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbird, is thought to have occurred about six million years ago.

There are three subspecies, including the nominate, of this tropicbird:

== Description ==
The red-billed tropicbird measures on average, which includes the -long . Without them the tropicbird measures about . It has a wingspan of . In overall appearance it is tern-like in shape. Its plumage is white, with black wing tips, and a back that is finely barred in black. It has a black mask that extends up from just above the lores to the sides of its nape, with gray mottling usually seen near the nape and hindneck. The tail has black shaft streaks, as do tail streamers. The are white, with some black on the outermost primaries and tertials and occasionally with black markings on the flanks. The iris is blackish-brown, and the bill is red. The legs, base of the central toe, and parts of the outer toes are orange-yellow while the rest of the feet are black. Although the sexes are similar, the males are generally larger than females, with the tail streamers being around longer on the male than on the female.

The subspecies of this bird can usually be distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies &quot;Phaethon aethereus mesonauta&quot; can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upper wing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies &quot;P. a. indicus&quot; can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with a black cutting edge.
When the chicks hatch, they are covered with gray down. This down is eventually cleared in about 40 to 50 days. The young chicks lack tail streamers. The juvenile looks similar to the adult with a mostly white crown. In the juvenile, the stripes above the eye usually are connected at the nape. The tail feathers usually have black tips or subterminal dots and without the tail streamers that are distinctive on the adult. Occasionally, a juvenile will have black markings on its flanks and under tail coverts.

The red-billed tropicbird can be differentiated from the other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upper wing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upper parts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the royal tern can be confused with the adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former&#x27;s less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.

This tropicbird moults once every year as an adult, following a complex basic strategy. This is completed before courtship and lasts between 19 and 29 weeks, with most being completed in 24 weeks. Birds gain their adult plumage at two to three years of age.

The red-billed tropicbird usually only calls near breeding colonies, where it joins in with groups of other adults, numbering from 2 to 20, in circling above the sea and making loud, harsh &quot;&quot; screams. If disturbed at the nest, the chicks will vocalize a loud and piercing shriek, either rasping or reeling.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The red-billed tropicbird has the smallest range of the three tropicbird species, yet it still ranges across the Neotropics, as well as the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian oceans. The nominate subspecies &quot;Phaethon aethereus aethereus&quot; breeds on islands in the Atlantic south of the equator, including Ascension, and Saint Helena on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos Archipelago in Brazilian waters. It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa. The subspecies &quot;P. a. mesonauta&quot; is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean. This subspecies was restricted to the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic but it has colonised the Canary Islands in the 21st century, especially Fuerteventura but also on other islands in that archipelago. The Indian Ocean subspecies, &quot;P. a. indicus&quot; is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka, the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula. The subspecies is also a rare but regular vagrant to Seychelles.

Within the West Indies, this species is most common in the Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands and small islands east of Puerto Rico. Breeding in the Western Palearctic occurs on the Cape Verde Islands and the Îles des Madeleines off Senegal. In 2000, the total number of pairs there was probably less than 150. In the Pacific Ocean, it breeds from the Gulf of California and Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico in the north, to the Galápagos Islands, Isla Plata, Ecuador and San Lorenzo Island, Peru. Researchers Larry Spear and David Ainley estimated the minimum population of the Pacific at around 15,750 birds in 1995 after 15 years of field observations. Red-billed tropicbirds disperse widely when not breeding, the juveniles more so than the adults, with birds in the Pacific reaching the 45th parallel north off Washington State and 32nd parallel south off Chile, with 19 records as of 2007 from Hawaii—some from Mexico. It sometimes wanders further, including five records from Great Britain, and two from Australia: October–December 2010 on Lord Howe Island and September 2014 on Ashmore Reef. In July 2005, one was found in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, while another has been seen at Matinicus Rock, Maine regularly since 2000.

== Behavior ==
The red-billed tropicbird can reach speeds of when flying out at sea, cruising a minimum of above the sea. It cannot stand and is not proficient at walking, and requires an unobstructed takeoff to fly from land. Conversely it can lift off the sea without much effort. Its plumage is waterproof and it floats on water.

=== Breeding ===

The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on isolated cliff faces, in loose colonies. It uses a simple scrape nest, located in a place it can easily take off from. The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was once seen breeding. In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the California Current, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year round in the Galápagos. Breeding is influenced by the availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in breeding. Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle.
Courtship and pairing usually lasts three to five weeks, during which this bird performs aerial courtship displays to potential mates. The courtship displays include flying in the air which takes the form of gliding interspersed with short periods of rapid wing-beating. In one display, a pair glide together for , with one bird around above the other. The upper bird bends its wings down and the lower lifts its up, so they are almost touching. The two sink to about above the sea before breaking off.

At nest sites, battles sometimes occur between two or more pairs before the original owners declare themselves as the owner of the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.

This tropicbird usually lays a clutch of one white buff to pale purple egg with reddish-brown spots. The egg usually measures and weighs around —10% of the adult female&#x27;s weight. It is incubated by both sexes for 42 to 46 days. If the egg does not survive the first few days in the nest, the female will usually lay a replacement egg. The chicks that hatch eventually fledge in about 10 to 15 weeks after hatching, although most fledge after about 80 to 90 days. Normally, the maximum weight of the chicks is about , but on years that are hotter than average, this can drop to about .

Born helpless and unable to move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents can be seen at normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.

=== Feeding ===
Although it is a poor swimmer, the red-billed tropicbird feeds on fish and squid. The fish are usually small, between about , although some caught are up to . The aquatic prey is mostly caught by diving into the water from the air, although flying fish, the preferred fish of this species, are sometimes caught while in the air. Fish species eaten include Pacific thread herring (&quot;Opisthonema libertate&quot;), sharpchin flying fish (&quot;Fodiator acutus&quot;), flying fish of the genus &quot;Hirundichthys&quot;, sailfin flying fish (&quot;Parexocoetus brachypterus&quot;), ornamented flying fish (&quot;Cypselurus callopterus&quot;), bigwing halfbeak (&quot;Oxyporhamphus micropterus&quot;), longfin halfbeak (&quot;Hemiramphus saltator&quot;), tropical two-wing flying fish (&quot;Exocoetus volitans&quot;), redlip blenny (&quot;Ophioblennius atlanticus&quot;), squirrelfish (&quot;Holocentrus adscensionis&quot;), mackerel scad (&quot;Decapterus macarellus&quot;), shortjaw leatherjacket (&quot;Oligoplites refulgens&quot;), and mackerels (&quot;Scomber&quot; spp.). Squid eaten include the glass squid (&quot;Hyaloteuthis pelagica&quot;).

As they grow, the chicks are fed increasingly larger quantities of fish and squid by their parents, generally partly digested and regurgitated. Most fish that the chicks are fed are below in length, although some fish fed to larger chicks can be up to in length.

This species of tropicbird usually forages alone. It usually dives into waters away from the coastline, diving from the air, at heights up to . It will usually hover over the water before diving. Sometimes, this bird follows predators that feed near the surface, such as dolphins or tuna. The red-billed tropicbird will feed on the fish driven either to or above the surface by the aforementioned predators. It usually forages in warmer waters, though does hunt in areas of cooler currents such as the Gulf of California. The species has also been recorded foraging in salt wedge estuaries.

== Relationship with humans ==
The red-billed tropicbird, a bird not indigenous to Bermuda, was displayed in error on the $50 Bermudian dollar and was replaced in 2012 by the white-tailed tropicbird, the tropicbird that can be found in Bermuda.

== Status ==
Accurate assessment of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult due to the remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of the sea where they might be found. This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the IUCN. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird&#x27;s environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.

=== Threats and survival ===
The eggs and chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both brown and black rats in places like Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are invasive species. Feral cats are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island Saba. On Saba, the problem has only arisen since about 2000. On Ascension Island, the effect of the eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year. On the Galápagos Islands, the short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) occasionally eats young birds. &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, an intracellular parasite, can be found in this bird. About 28% of red-billed tropicbirds produce antibodies for &quot;T. gondii&quot;.

Under normal conditions about 75% of the eggs hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, can be caused by pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan of this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.

<text>Enheduanna ( , also transliterated as , , or variants; ) was the (high) priestess of the moon god Nanna (Sīn) in the Sumerian city-state of Ur in the reign of her father, Sargon of Akkad ( BCE). She was likely appointed by her father as the leader of the religious group at Ur to cement ties between the Akkadian religion of her father and the native Sumerian religion.

Enheduanna has been celebrated as the earliest known named author in world history, as a number of works in Sumerian literature, such as the &quot;Exaltation of Inanna&quot; feature her as the first-person narrator, and other works, such as the &quot;Sumerian Temple Hymns&quot; may identify her as their author. However, there is considerable debate among modern Assyriologists based on linguistic and archaeological grounds as to whether or not she actually wrote or composed any of the rediscovered works that have been attributed to her. Additionally, the only manuscripts of the works attributed to her were written by scribes in the First Babylonian Empire six centuries after she lived, written in a more recent dialect of the Sumerian language than she would have spoken. These scribes may have attributed these works to her as part of the legendary narratives of the dynasty of Sargon of Akkad in later Babylonian traditions.

The cultural memory of Enheduanna and the works attributed to her were lost some time after the end of the First Babylonian Empire. Her existence was first rediscovered by modern archaeology in 1927, when Sir Leonard Wooley excavated the Giparu in the ancient city of Ur and found an alabaster disk with her name, association with Sargon of Akkad, and occupation inscribed on the reverse. References to her name were then later discovered in excavated works of Sumerian literature, which initiated investigation into her potential authorship of those works. Enheduanna&#x27;s archaeological rediscovery has attracted a considerable amount of attention and scholarly debate in modern times related to her potential attribution as the first known named author. She has also received considerable attention in feminism, and the works attributed to her have also been studied as an early progenitor of classical rhetoric. English translations of her works have inspired a number of literary adaptations and representations.

== Background ==
Enheduanna&#x27;s father was Sargon of Akkad, founder of the Akkadian Empire. In a surviving inscription Sargon styles himself &quot;Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer () of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed () of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor () of Enlil&quot;. The inscription celebrates the conquest of Uruk and the defeat of Lugal-zage-si, whom Sargon brought &quot;in a collar to the gate of Enlil&quot;: Sargon then conquered Ur and &quot;laid waste&quot; the territory from Lagash to the sea, ultimately conquering at least 34 cities in total.

Irene J. Winter states that Sargon, having conquered Ur, likely sought to &quot;consolidate the Akkadian dynasty&#x27;s links with the traditional Sumerian past in the important cult and political center of Ur&quot; by appointing Enheduanna to an important position in the native Sumerian moon god cult. Winter states that is likely that the position she was appointed to already existed beforehand, and that her appointment to this role, and the attribution to Nanna would have helped her forge a syncreticism between the Sumerian religion and the Semitic religion. After Enheduanna, the role of high priestess continued to be held by members of the royal family. Joan Goodnick Westenholz suggests that the role of high priestess appears to have held a similar level of honor to that of a king; as the high priestess of Nanna, Enheduanna would have served as the embodiment of Ningal, spouse of Nanna, which would have given her actions divine authority. However, although the Giparu in Ur where the en priestess of Nanna worshipped has been extensively studied by archaeologists, we have no definitive information about what their duties were.

=== Rebellion of Lugal-Ane ===
Toward the end of the reign of Sargon&#x27;s grandson Narām-Sîn, numerous former city-states rebelled against the Akkadian central power. From hints in the song (&quot;the Exaltation of Inana&quot;), the events can be reconstructed from the point of view of Enheduanna: a certain Lugal-Ane came to power in the city of Ur, who as the new ruler invoked the legitimacy of the city god Nanna. Lugal-Ane is probably identical with a Lugal-An-na or Lugal-An-né, who is mentioned in ancient Babylonian literary texts about the war as king of Ur. Apparently Lugal-Ane demanded that the high priestess and consort of the moon god Enheduanna had to confirm his assumption of power. En-ḫedu-anna, as representative of the Sargonid dynasty, refused, whereupon she was suspended from her office and expelled from the city. The mention of the temple E-ešdam-ku indicates that she then found refuge in the city of Ĝirsu. In this exile, she composed the song , the performance of which was intended to persuade the goddess Inanna (as Ištar the patron goddess of her dynasty) to intervene on behalf of the Akkadian empire.

King Narām-Sîn succeeded in putting down the rebellion of Lugal-Ane and other kings and restored the Akkadian central authority for the remaining years of his reign. Probably Enheduanna then returned to her office in the city of Ur.

== Archaeological artifact ==

In 1927, as part of excavations at Ur, British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley discovered an alabaster disk shattered into several pieces, which has since been reconstructed. The reverse side of the disk identifies Enheduanna as the wife of Nanna and daughter of Sargon of Akkad. The front side shows the high priestess standing in worship as what has been interpreted as a nude male figure pours a libation. Irene Winter states that &quot;given the placement and attention to detail&quot; of the central figure, &quot;she has been identified as Enheduanna&quot; Two seals bearing her name, belonging to her servants and dating to the Sargonic period, have been excavated at the Giparu at Ur.

Two of the works attributed to Enheduanna, &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna&quot; and &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot; have survived in numerous manuscripts due to their presence in the Decad, an advanced scribal curriculum in the First Babylonian Empire of the 18th and 17th centuries BCE. Black et al. suggest that &quot;perhaps Enheduanna has survived in scribal literature&quot; due to the &quot;continuing fascination with the dynasty of her father Sargon of Akkad&quot;.

== Attributed works ==
The first person to connect the disk and seals with literary works excavated in Nippur was Adam Falkenstein, who observed that the &quot;Temple Hymns&quot; and two hymns to Inanna: &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna&quot; and another &quot;Hymn to Inanna&quot; (at the time not yet reconstructed) contained references to Enheduanna. Falkenstein suggested that this might be evidence of Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship, but acknowledged that the hymns are only known from the later Old Babylonian period and that more work would need to be done constructing and analyzing the received texts before any conclusions could be made. In 1989, Westenholz suggested that &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot; and two other hymns, to Nanna at Ur, might also have been written by her.

=== Temple hymns ===

The hymns have been reconstructed from 37 tablets from Ur and Nippur, most of which date to the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. Each hymn is dedicated to a particular deity from the Sumerian pantheon and a city with which the deity was associated, and may have helped to create syncreticism between the native Sumerian religion and the Semitic religion of the Akkadian empire. However, some of these poems, such as hymn 9, addressed to the temple of the deified king Sulgi from the later Third Dynasty of Ur, cannot have been written by Enheduanna or anyone in the Akkadian empire, showing that the collection may have gained additional poems over time.

The first translation of the collection into English was by Åke W. Sjöberg, who also argued that the mention of a &quot;subscript&quot; or colophon of two lines near the end of the composition appear to credit her with composition of the preceding text. However, Black shows that in the majority of manuscripts, the line following this colophon, which contains the line count for the 42nd and final hymn, demonstrates that the preceding two lines are part of the 42nd hymn. Black concludes that: &quot;At most... it might be reasonable to accept a claim for (Enheduanna)&#x27;s authorship or editorship&quot; for only Hymn 42, the final hymn in the collection.

=== Hymns dedicated to Inanna ===
==== &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna&quot; ====
 (&quot;Mistress of the innumerable me&quot;; modern translations also include &quot;The Exaltation of Inana&quot; / &quot;Inana B&quot;) is a hymn to the goddess Inanna of 154 lines. According to Claus Wilcke, the text &quot;belongs to the most difficult that exists in the literary tradition in Sumerian&quot;. The first complete edition of was produced by Hallo/van Dijk in 1968. A fundamentally new edition based on a broader textual foundation as well as recent linguistic research and textual criticism was published by Annette Zgoll in 1997, with further improvements in Zgoll 2014 and 2021.

The work refers to the rebellion of Lugal-Ane and Enheduanna&#x27;s exile. Probably composed in exile in Ĝirsu, the song is intended to persuade the goddess Inanna to intervene in the conflict in favor of Enheduanna and the Sargonian dynasty. To reach this, the text constructs a myth: An, the king of the gods, endows the goddess Inanna with divine powers and has her execute his judgment on all the cities of Sumer, making her herself the ruler of the land and most powerful of all the gods. When now the city of Ur rebels against her rule, Inanna passes her judgment over it and has it executed by Nanna, the city god of Ur and her father. Inanna has thus become the mistress of heaven and earth alike – and thus empowered to enforce her will even over the originally superior gods (An and Nanna), which results in the destruction of Ur and Lugal-Ane.

==== &quot;Hymn to Inanna&quot; ====
Also called &quot;The Great-Hearted Mistress&quot; or &quot;The Stout-Hearted Mistress&quot; (incipit ), the &quot;Hymn to Inanna&quot;, which is only partially preserved in a fragmentary form, is outlined by Black et al. as containing three parts: an introductory section (lines 1–90) emphasizing Inanna&#x27;s &quot;martial abilities&quot;; a long, middle section (lines 91–218) that serves as a direct address to Inanna, listing her many positive and negative powers, and asserting her superiority over other deities, and a concluding section (219–274) narrated by Enheduanna that exists in a very fragmentary form.

Black et al. surmise that the fragmentary nature of the concluding section makes it unclear whether Enheduanna composed the hymn, the concluding section was a later addition, or that her name was added to the poem later in the Old Babylonian period from &quot;a desire to attribute it to her&quot;. They also note that the concluding section also appears to reference &quot;some historical events which cannot be elucidated.&quot; This poem also contains a potential reference to the events described in &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot;, which has led Westenholz to suggest that that poem may have been written by Enheduanna as well.

The first English translation of this work was by Sjöberg in 1975.

==== &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot; ====
The hymn &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot; (incipit ) is characterized by Black et al. as &quot;Inanna in warrior mode.&quot; The poem starts with a hymn to Inanna as &quot;lady of battle&quot; (lines 1–24) then shifts to a narration by Inanna herself in the first person (lines 25–52), where she describes the revenge she wants to take on the mountains of Ebih for their refusal to bow to her. 

Inanna then visits the sky god An and requests his assistance (lines 53–111), but An doubts Inanna&#x27;s ability to take revenge (lines 112–130). This causes Inanna to fly into a rage and attack Ebih (lines 131–159). Inanna then recounts how she overthrew Ebih (lines 160–181) and the poem ends with a praise of Inanna (lines 182–184).
The &quot;rebel lands&quot; of Ebih that are overthrown in the poem have been identified with the Jebel Hamrin mountain range in modern Iraq. Black et al. describe these lands as &quot;home to the nomadic, barbarian tribes who loom large in Sumerian literature as forces of destruction and chaos&quot; that sometimes need to be &quot;brought under divine control&quot;.

=== Hymns dedicated to Nanna ===
The two hymns dedicated to Nanna are labeled by Westenholz as &quot;Hymn of Praise to Ekisnugal and Nanna on [the] Assumption of En-ship&quot; (incipit ) and &quot;Hymn of Praise of Enheduanna&quot; (incipit lost). The second hymn is very fragmentary.

== Authorship debate ==
The question of Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship of poems has been subject to significant debate. While Hallo and Åke Sjöberg were the first to definitively assert Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship of the works attributed to her, other Assyriologists including Miguel Civil and Jeremy Black have put forth arguments rejecting or doubting Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship. Civil has raised the possibility that &quot;Enheduanna&quot; refers not to the name, but instead the station of EN-priestess that the daughter of Sargon of Akkad held.

For the Inanna and Nanna poems, Black et al. argue that at best, all of the manuscript sources date from at least six centuries after when she would have lived, and they were found in scribal settings, not ritual ones, and that &quot;surviving sources show no traces of Old Sumerian... making it impossible to posit what that putative original might have looked like.&quot;

Despite these concerns, Hallo says that there is still little reason to doubt Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship of these works. Hallo, responding to Miguel Civil, not only still maintains Enheduanna&#x27;s authorship of all of the works attributed to her, but rejects &quot;excess skepticism&quot; in Assyriology as a whole, and noting that &quot;rather than limit the inferences they draw from it&quot; other scholars should consider that &quot;the abundant textual documentation from Mesopotamia... provides a precious resource for tracing the origins and evolution of countless facets of civilization.&quot;

Summarizing the debate, Paul A. Delnero, professor of Assyriology at Johns Hopkins University, remarks that &quot;the attribution is exceptional, and against the practice of anonymous authorship during the period; it almost certainly served to invest these compositions with an even greater authority and importance than they would have had otherwise, rather than to document historical reality&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
Enheduanna has received substantial attention in feminism. In a BBC Radio 4 interview, Assyriologist Eleanor Robson credits this to the feminist movement of the 1970s, when, two years after attending a lecture by Cyrus H. Gordon in 1976, American anthropologist Marta Weigle introduced Enheduanna to an audience of feminist scholars as &quot;the first known author in world literature&quot; with her introductory essay &quot;Women as Verbal Artists: Reclaiming the Sisters of Enheduanna&quot;. Robson says that after this publication, the &quot;feminist image of Enheduanna... as a wish fulfillment figure&quot; took off. Rather than as a &quot;pioneer poetess&quot; of feminism, Robson states that the picture of Enheduanna from the surviving works of the 18th century BCE is instead one of her as &quot;her father&#x27;s political and religious instrument&quot;. Robson also stresses that there exists neither &quot;access to what Enheduanna thought or did&quot; nor &quot;evidence that (Enheduanna) was able to write&quot;, but that as the high priestess and daughter of Sargon of Akkad, Enheduanna was &quot;probably the most privileged woman of her time&quot;.

Enheduanna has also been analyzed as an early rhetorical theorist. Roberta Binkley finds evidence in &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna&quot; of invention and classical modes of persuasion. Hallo, building on the work of Binkley, compares the sequence of the &quot;Hymn to Inanna&quot;, &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot;, and the &quot;Exaltation of Inanna&quot; to the biblical Book of Amos, and considers these both evidence of &quot;the birth of rhetoric in Mesopotamia.&quot;

<doc id="330962" wikidata="Q1413856" url="?curid=330962" title="Geographical Fugue">
<text>The Geographical Fugue or Fuge aus der Geographie is the most famous piece for spoken chorus by Ernst Toch.
Toch was a prominent composer in 1920s Berlin, and singlehandedly invented the idiom of the &quot;Spoken Chorus&quot;.

The work was composed as the third and final movement in Toch&#x27;s suite &quot;Gesprochene Musik&quot; (Spoken Music). The suite was designed to be recorded by a chorus on gramophone records at 78 rpm, then &quot;performed&quot; in concert by replaying the records at a much higher speed. As Toch wrote in his original program notes: &quot;increasing the tempo, and the resulting pitch level ... created a type of instrumental music, which leads the listener to forget that it originated from speaking&quot;.

The piece was first performed, in its original German, at the Neue Musik Berlin festival in June 1930. The performance, in front of an audience that included experimental composer John Cage, was a sensational success. When Toch arrived in the United States in 1935, as a refugee from Nazi Germany, Cage sought him out and obtained permission for the Fugue to be published in English translation.
It remains Toch&#x27;s most-performed work, although the composer himself dismissed it as an unimportant diversion.

==Construction==
It is written in strict fugal form, and consists of four voices, each enunciating various cities, countries and other geographical landmarks in true contrapuntal fashion. It ends with a climactic finale featuring a sustained trill on the &quot;R&quot; of the word &quot;Ratibor!&quot; (&quot;Trinidad&quot; in the English Language version), the first word of the subject.
Voices enter in the order of: &quot;tenor, alto, soprano, bass&quot;.

==Text==
===Translation===
Although written originally in German, it was later translated into English under the auspices of John Cage and Henry Cowell and received wide acclaim. The text (English translation) of all the parts consists of various permutations of the following lines:

:Trinidad! 
:And the big Mississippi 
:and the town Honolulu 
:and the lake Titicaca,
:the Popocatepetl is not in Canada, 
:rather in Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!
:Canada, Málaga, Rimini, Brindisi
:Canada, Málaga, Rimini, Brindisi
:Yes, Tibet, Tibet, Tibet, Tibet, 
:Nagasaki! Yokohama!
:Nagasaki! Yokohama!

The place names are largely the same in German and English except for Ratibor (in place of Trinidad) and Athen (in place of Tibet) which is pronounced with the stress on the second syllable in German. The German text is as follows;

:Ratibor!
:Und der Fluss Mississippi
:und die Stadt Honolulu
:und der See Titicaca;
:Der Popocatepetl liegt nicht in Kanada,
:sondern in Mexiko, Mexiko, Mexiko.
:Kanada, Málaga, Rimini, Brindisi,
:Kanada, Málaga, Rimini, Brindisi.
:Ja! Athen, Athen, Athen, Athen,
:Nagasaki, Yokohama,
:Nagasaki, Yokohama,

<text>Émile Jean-Horace Vernet (; 30 June 178917 January 1863) more commonly known as simply Horace Vernet, was a French painter of battles, portraits, and Orientalist subjects.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Vernet was born to Carle Vernet, another famous painter, who was himself a son of Claude Joseph Vernet. He was born in the Paris Louvre, while his parents were staying there during the French Revolution. Vernet quickly developed a disdain for the high-minded seriousness of academic French art work which was distinguished by art influenced by Classicism, and decided to paint subjects taken mostly from contemporary life. During his early career, when Napoleon Bonaparte was in power, he began depicting the French soldier in a more familiar, vernacular manner rather than in an idealized, Davidian fashion; he was just twenty when he exhibited the &quot;Taking of an Entrenched Camp&quot; Some other of his paintings that represent French soldiers in a more direct, less idealizing style, include &quot;Dog of the Regiment&quot;, &quot;Trumpeter&#x27;s Horse&quot;, and &quot;Death of Poniatowski&quot;.

===Restoration France===
He gained recognition during the Bourbon Restoration for a series of battle paintings commissioned by the duc d&#x27;Orleans, the future King Louis-Philippe. Critics marvelled at the incredible speed with which he painted. Many of his paintings made during this early phase of his career were &quot;noted for their historical accuracy as well as their charged landscapes&quot;. Examples of paintings in this style include his Four Battles series: &quot;The Battle of Jemappes&quot; (1821), &quot;The Battle of Montmirail&quot; (1822), &quot;The Battle of Hanau&quot; (1824), and &quot;The Battle of Valmy&quot; (1826). Enjoying equal favour with the court and with the opposition, he was appointed director of the French Academy in Rome, from 1829 to 1835.

Over the course of his long career, Horace Vernet was honoured with dozens of important commissions. King Louis-Philippe was one of his most prolific patrons, and the whole of the Constantine room at the Palace of Versailles was decorated by him, in the short space of three years. The King requested that he paint a gallery dedicated to the &quot;fruits of colonization&quot;. At the time, France was colonizing Algeria through war, and claiming it to be part of their &quot;mission civilisatrice&quot;, or their &quot;civilizing mission&quot;. In a neoclassical style, reflecting the Roman colonization in North Africa about 2000 years before, Horace painted pictures of French non-commissioned officers training Algerian soldiers, French engineers building Algerian roads, and French soldiers tilling Algerian fields.

===Later career===
His depictions of Algerian battles, such as the &quot;Capture of the Smahla&quot; and the &quot;Capture of Constantine&quot;, were well received by other French people, as they were vivid depictions of their army in the heat of battle. After the fall of the July Monarchy during the Revolution of 1848, Vernet discovered a new patron in Napoléon III of France. He continued to paint representations of the heroic French army during the Second Empire and maintained his commitment to and realistic way. He accompanied the French Army during the Crimean War, producing several paintings, truthfully including one of the Battle of the Alma, which was not as well received as his earlier paintings. One well known and possibly apocryphal anecdote maintains that when Vernet was asked to remove a certain obnoxious general from one of his paintings, he replied, &quot;I am a painter of history, sire, and I will not violate the truth&quot;, hence demonstrating his fidelity to representing war.

Vernet also developed an interest in daguerreotype photography. He took photographs in Egypt as reference material for his paintings, and during a stop at Malta in March 1840 while en route to Egypt, he took the earliest known photographs of the island at Fort Manoel. Today these early photographs are believed to be lost.

His nephew Frédéric Goupil-Fesquet, also a painter and his pupil, wrote &quot;Voyage d&#x27;Horace Vernet en Orient&quot; (2 volumes, 1844).

Vernet died in his hometown of Paris in 1863.

==Literary references==
In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;, Holmes claims to be related to Vernet, stating, &quot;My ancestors were country squires... my grandmother... was the sister of Vernet, the French artist&quot;; it is generally assumed that this individual is Émile Jean-Horace Vernet, because Horace was only 65 years older than Sherlock Holmes while the other Vernets lived much before. The Holmes-Vernet connection is also central to the plot of Laurie R. King&#x27;s 2024 novel, &quot;The Lantern&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

<text>Karl Hess (born Carl Hess III; May 25, 1923 – April 22, 1994) was an American speechwriter and author. He was also a political philosopher, editor, welder, motorcycle racer, tax resister, and libertarian activist. His career included stints on the Republican right and the New Left before embracing a mix of left-libertarianism and laissez-faire anarcho-capitalism, a term which is attested earliest in his 1969 essay &quot;The Death of Politics&quot;. Later in life, he summed up his role in the economy by remarking &quot;I am by occupation a free marketer (crafts and ideas, woodworking, welding, and writing).&quot;

==Early life==
Hess was born in Washington, D.C., and moved to the Philippines as a child. His parents were of German and Spanish ancestry. When his mother discovered his father&#x27;s marital infidelity, she divorced her wealthy husband and returned (with Karl) to Washington. She refused alimony or child support and took a job as a telephone operator, raising her son in very modest circumstances.

Karl&#x27;s mother encouraged curiosity and direct learning. She often insisted that Karl figure things out for himself, or increase his knowledge through reading. Karl, believing (as his mother did) that public education was a waste of time, rarely attended school; to evade truancy officers, he registered at every elementary school in town and gradually withdrew from each one, making it impossible for the authorities to know exactly where he was supposed to be. He had developed great reverence for libraries; this became very basic to his personal philosophy, and in his autobiography he wrote: &quot;Literacy is the basic tool in the workshop of the entire world.&quot;

As a young person, Karl played tennis, learned marksmanship, and pursued fencing. Later on he learned gunsmithing. He officially dropped out at 15 and went to work for the Mutual Broadcasting System as a newswriter at the invitation of Walter Compton, a Mutual news commentator who resided in the building where Mrs. Hess operated the switchboard. Hess continued to work in the news media, and by age 18 was assistant city editor of &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot;.

Early during the Second World War, Hess enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942. He was discharged when they discovered he had contracted malaria in the Philippines.

He was later an editor for &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;The Fisherman.&quot; He worked as a staff writer, and sometimes as a freelancer, for a number of anti-Communist periodicals. In the 1950s he worked for the Champion Papers and Fibre Company. He was dismayed that people in the management portion of the corporate world seemed more interested in personal advancement than in doing good work. At Champion his bosses encouraged him to get involved in conservative politics for the company&#x27;s benefit. In doing so he met Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and many other prominent Republicans, thus beginning the GOP epoch of his life.

In his book &quot;Dear America,&quot; Hess wrote that he became an atheist because his temporary job as a coroner&#x27;s assistant when he was 15 left him convinced that people were simply flesh-and-blood beings with no afterlife. Consequently, he stopped attending church (he had been a devout Roman Catholic). Years later, while on leave from Champion and working for the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), he resumed attending church because virtually all of his AEI colleagues did so. His return merely reinforced his atheism; on one Sunday morning, while enduring a service as his young son sat on his lap, Hess became disgusted with himself for exposing his child to an institution he himself had rejected.

==Political activities==
Hess was the primary author of the Republican Party&#x27;s 1960 and 1964 platforms. In the lead-up to the 1964 presidential election, Hess worked closely with Barry Goldwater. He came to view Goldwater as a man of sterling character, a conservative holding a number of significant libertarian convictions. Hess worked as a speechwriter, and explored ideology and politics. He was widely considered to be the author of the renowned Goldwater line, &quot;Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue,&quot; but revealed that he had encountered it in a letter from Lincoln historian Harry Jaffa and later learned it was a paraphrase of a passage from Cicero. He later called this his &quot;Cold Warrior&quot; phase.

Following the 1964 presidential campaign in which Lyndon Johnson trounced Goldwater, Hess became disillusioned with traditional politics and became more radical. Hess and others on the losing team had found themselves outsiders within the national Republican party because of their support of the controversial Goldwater. Hess felt that he had been purged by the Republicans and he departed from involvement with grand-scale politics altogether.

In 1965 Hess took up motorcycle riding. His need to occasionally repair his motorcycles led to his interest in welding (which he learned at Bell Vocational School, in 1967). Welding skills gave him something he could trade upon. Initially, he set up a commercial partnership, with a fellow Bell graduate, doing on-site industrial welding. Eventually, his skill led to an involvement with welded-metal sculpture.

All of this unfolded around the same time as his divorce from his first wife. Hess hereafter publicly criticized big business, suburban American hypocrisy and the military-industrial complex. Though well beyond college age, Hess joined Students for a Democratic Society, worked with the Black Panther Party and protested the Vietnam War.

After his work on the Goldwater campaign, Hess was audited by the Internal Revenue Service, which he believed was in retaliation for his support of the losing candidate. In response, he sent the IRS a copy of the Declaration of Independence with a letter saying that he would never again pay taxes. Hess claimed that the IRS then threatened to put a lien on all of his property and 100% of his future earnings. He was supported financially thereafter by his wife and used barter to keep himself afloat.

In 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president and Barry Goldwater returned to the Senate as Arizona&#x27;s junior senator. Hess, despite now being a member of the New Left, had recently written some speeches for Goldwater and resumed their close personal relationship; he had concluded that American men should not be forced into military service and urged Goldwater to submit legislation abolishing conscription. Goldwater replied, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s wait and see what Dick Nixon wants to do about that one.&quot; Hess despised Nixon almost as much as he admired Goldwater and could not tolerate the notion that Goldwater would defer to Nixon. Thus ended one of Hess&#x27;s closest professional associations, and the situation significantly compromised one of his deepest friendships. (Nixon abolished conscription during his presidency, with Goldwater&#x27;s support.) Incidentally, both Hess and Nixon would die on the same day, April 22, 1994.

Hess began reading American anarchists largely because of the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard. Hess said that upon reading the works of Emma Goldman he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent, and that Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of Ayn Rand without any of the &quot;crazy solipsism that Rand was so fond of.&quot;

From 1969 to 1971, Hess edited &quot;The Libertarian Forum&quot; with Rothbard.

Hess had come to put his focus on the small scale, on community. He said, &quot;Society is: people together making culture.&quot; He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be &quot;opposition to central political authority&quot; and &quot;concern for people as individuals.&quot; His rejection of standard American party politics was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said, &quot;The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy...&quot;

In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre, Dana Rohrabacher, Samuel Edward Konkin III, and former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) leader Carl Oglesby to speak at two &quot;left-right&quot; conferences which brought together activists from both the Old Right and the New Left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement.

As part of his effort to unite right and left-libertarianism, Hess would join the SDS as well as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained, &quot;We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They&#x27;re destroying the militant black leaders the same way now. If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, &#x27;What happened to the blacks? Why aren&#x27;t they militant anymore?

In the 1980s, Hess joined the Libertarian Party, which had been founded in 1971. He served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990.

==Adams-Morgan experiment and back-to-the-land==
Hess was an early proponent of the &quot;back to the land&quot; movement, and his focus on self-reliance and small communities happened in part by government mandate. According to a &quot;Libertarian Party News&quot; obituary, &quot;When the Internal Revenue Service confiscated all his property and put a 100 percent lien on all of his future earnings, Hess (who had learned welding at Bell Vocational School) existed on bartering his work for food and goods.&quot;

Hess&#x27;s life as a welder put him in rapport with a very large segment of the American population who are manual laborers. He eventually came to the conviction that virtually no one in national politics identified with these people anymore. Hess&#x27;s revolt against public giantism reflected a distrust toward large-corporate business as well as big government. After Hess had made friends within the New Left and related circles, he began to encounter the young, new-breed appropriate technology enthusiasts (exemplified, by the early 1970s, in the editors and readerships of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; and &quot;Mother Earth News&quot;).

In the early 1970s, Hess became involved in an experiment with several friends and colleagues to bring self-built and -managed technology into the direct service of the economic and social life of the (at the time) poor, largely African American neighborhood of Adams-Morgan in Washington, D.C. It was the neighborhood in which Hess had spent his childhood. Afterward, Hess wrote a book entitled &quot;Community Technology&quot; which told the story of this experiment and its results. According to Hess, the residents had a vigorous go at participatory democracy, and the neighborhood seemed for a time like a fertile ground for the growth of community identity and capability.

Much of the technological experimentation Hess and others engaged in there was successful in technical terms (apparatus was built, food raised, solar energy captured, etc.). For instance, Hess wrote: &quot;In one experiment undertaken by the author and associates, an inner-city basement space, roughly thirty by fifty feet, was sufficient to house plywood tanks in which rainbow trout were produced at a cost of less than a dollar per pound. In a regular production run the total number of fish that can be raised in such a basement area was projected to be five tons per year.&quot; He taught courses and lectured on Appropriate Technology and Social Change in this period at the Institute for Social Ecology in Vermont. Nonetheless, the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, continuing on what he felt was a path of social deterioration and real-estate gentrification, declined to devote itself to expanding on the technology. Hence, in his view, a needy community got little value from the application of viable technology.

Subsequently, Hess and his wife, Therese, moved to rural Opequon Creek between Martinsburg and Kearneysville, West Virginia, where he set up a welding shop as partial support for his household. He became deeply involved with local affairs there. Hess built an affordable house that relied largely on passive-solar heating, and took an interest in wind power and all forms of solar energy. The house they built was a 2000 sq. ft. sun-warmed, earth-sheltered structure – constructed mostly using their own labor, and at cost of just $10,000 (mid-1970s dollars). They acquired most of the tools needed for the construction, and the appliances needed for a comfortable modern life, second-hand. By the late 1970s, Hess saw solar energy as emblematic of decentralization and nuclear energy as emblematic of central organization.

Hess wrote for a survivalist newsletter titled &quot;Personal Survival (&quot;P.S.&quot;) Letter,&quot; which was published from 1977 to 1982. It was first published and edited by Mel Tappan. In the same time period, Hess authored the book &quot;A Common Sense Strategy for Survivalists&quot;.

Hess ran a symbolic campaign for Governor of West Virginia in 1992. When asked by a reporter what his first act would be if elected, he quipped, &quot;I will demand an immediate recount.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a Reuters op-ed piece, in 2012, New Yorker Maureen Tkacik asserted that Karl Hess was the ideological grandfather of the anti-1% movement – making Hess the direct antecedent of thinkers like Ron Paul and both the Tea Party movement and the Occupy movement. She cites the detailed argument Hess, in his libertarian phase, put forward in his book &quot;Dear America&quot; to delineate and decry the extreme concentration of power in the hands of a tiny financial and stock-holding elite. Tkacik quotes passages from Hess&#x27;s book to offer proof that Hess developed the language of the 1% versus the 99% (the former being those whose role, according to Hess, is demonstrably detrimental to the vast majority of Americans).

<text>Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa (10 October 1941 – 10 November 1995) was a Nigerian writer, teacher, television producer, and social rights activist. Saro-Wiwa was a member of the Ogoni people, an ethnic minority in Nigeria whose homeland, Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta, has been targeted for crude oil extraction since the 1950s and has suffered extreme environmental damage from decades of indiscriminate petroleum waste dumping.

Initially as a spokesperson, and then as the president, of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multiple international oil companies, especially the Royal Dutch Shell company. He criticized the Nigerian government for its reluctance to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies operating in the area.

At the peak of his non-violent campaign, he was tried by a special military tribunal for allegedly masterminding the murder of Ogoni chiefs at a pro-government meeting, and hanged in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha. His execution provoked international outrage and resulted in Nigeria&#x27;s suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations for more than three years.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kenule Saro-Wiwa was born in Bori, near Port-Harcourt, Nigeria, on 10 October 1941. He was the son of Chief Jim Wiwa, a forest ranger who held a title in the Nigerian chieftaincy system, and his third wife Widu. He officially changed his name to Saro-Wiwa after the Nigerian Civil War. 
He was married to Maria Saro Wiwa.
His father&#x27;s hometown was the village of Bane, Ogoniland, whose residents speak the Khana dialect of the Ogoni language. He spent his childhood in an Anglican home and eventually proved himself to be an excellent student. He received primary education at a Native Authority school in Bori, then attended secondary school at Government College Umuahia. A distinguished student, he was captain of the table tennis team and amassed school prizes in History and English. 

On the completion of his secondary education, he obtained a scholarship to study English at the University of Ibadan. At Ibadan, he plunged into academic and cultural interests, he won departmental prizes in 1963 and 1965 and worked for a drama troupe. The travelling drama troupe performed in Kano, Benin, Ilorin and Lagos and collaborated with the Nottingham Playhouse theater group. 

He briefly became a teaching assistant at the University of Lagos and later at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He was an African literature lecturer in Nsukka when the civil war broke out, he supported the Federal Government and had to leave the region for his hometown at Bori. On his journey to Port-Harcourt, he witnessed the multitudes of refugees returning to the East, a scene he described as a &quot;sorry sight to see&quot;. Three days after his arrival to Bonny, it fell to federal troops. He and his family then stayed in Bonny, he travelled back to Lagos and took a position at the University of Lagos which did not last long as he was called back to Bonny.

He was called back to become the Civilian Administrator for the port city of Bonny in the Niger Delta. During the Nigerian Civil War he positioned himself as an Ogoni leader dedicated to the Federal cause. He followed his job as an administrator with an appointment as a commissioner in the old Rivers State. His best known novel, &quot;&quot; (1985), tells the story of a naive village boy recruited to the army during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, and intimates the political corruption and patronage in Nigeria&#x27;s military regime of the time. His war diaries, &quot;On a Darkling Plain&quot; (1989), document his experience during the war. He was also a successful businessman and television producer. His satirical television series, &quot;Basi &amp; Company&quot;, was wildly popular, with an estimated audience of 30 million.

In the early 1970s, he served as the Regional Commissioner for Education in the Rivers State Cabinet. But was dismissed in 1973 because of his support for Ogoni autonomy. In the late 1970s, he established a number of successful business ventures in retail and real estate, and during the 1980s concentrated primarily on his writing, journalism and television production. In 1977, he became involved in the political arena running as the candidate to represent Ogoni in the Constituent Assembly. He lost the election in a narrow margin. It was during this time he had a fall out with his friend Edwards Kobani.

His intellectual work was interrupted in 1987 when he re-entered the political scene, having been appointed by the newly installed dictator Ibrahim Babangida to aid the country&#x27;s transition to democracy. But he resigned because he felt Babangida&#x27;s supposed plans for a return to democracy were disingenuous. His sentiments were proven correct in the coming years, as Babangida failed to relinquish power. In 1993, Babangida annulled Nigeria&#x27;s general elections that would have transferred power to a civilian government, sparking mass civil unrest and eventually forcing him to step down, at least officially, that same year.

===Works===
Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s works include TV, drama and prose writing. His earlier works from 1970s to 1980s were mostly satirical displays that portray a counter-image of Nigerian society. But his later writings were more inspired by political dimensions such as environmental and social justice than satire.

&quot;Transistor Radio&quot;, one of his best known plays, was written for a revue during his university days at Ibadan but still resonated well with Nigerian society and was adapted into a television series. Some of his works drew inspiration from the play. In 1972, a radio version of the play was produced and in 1985, he produced &quot;Basi and Company&quot;, a successful screen adaption of the play. He included the play in &quot;Four Farcical Plays&quot; and &quot;Basi and Company: Four Television Plays&quot;. &quot;Basi and Company&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Transistor Radio&quot;, ran on television from 1985 to 1990. A farcical comedy, the show chronicles city life and is anchored by the protagonist, Basi, a resourceful and street-wise character looking for ways to achieve his goal of obtaining millions which always ends to become an illusive mission.

In 1985, the Biafran Civil War novel &quot;Sozaboy&quot; was published. The protagonist&#x27;s language was written in nonstandard English or what He called &quot;Rotten English&quot;, a hybrid language of pidgin English, standard English and broken English.

===Activism===
In 1990, he began devoting most of his time to human rights and environmental causes, particularly in the land settled by the Ogoni people. He was one of the earliest members of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which advocated for the rights of the Ogoni people. The Ogoni Bill of Rights, written by MOSOP, set out the movement&#x27;s demands, including increased autonomy for the Ogoni people, a fair share of the proceeds of oil extraction, and remediation of environmental damage to Ogoni lands. In particular, MOSOP struggled against the degradation of Ogoni lands by Royal Dutch Shell.

In 1992, He was imprisoned for several months, without trial, by the Nigerian military government.

He was Vice Chairman of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) General Assembly from 1993 to 1995. UNPO is an international, nonviolent, and democratic organisation (of which MOSOP is a member). Its members are indigenous peoples, minorities, and under-recognised or occupied territories who have joined together to protect and promote their human and cultural rights, to preserve their environments and to find nonviolent solutions to conflicts which affect them.

In January 1993, MOSOP organised peaceful marches of around 300,000 Ogoni people– more than half of the Ogoni population – through four Ogoni urban centres, drawing international attention to their people&#x27;s plight. The same year the Nigerian government occupied the region militarily.

===Arrest and execution===
He was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993 but was released after a month.
On 21 May 1994, four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were brutally murdered. 

Saro-Wiwa had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but he was arrested and accused of inciting them. He denied the charges but was imprisoned for more than a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal. The same happened to eight other MOSOP leaders who, along with Saro-Wiwa, became known as the Ogoni Nine.

Some of the defendants&#x27; lawyers resigned in protest against the alleged rigging of the trial by the Abacha regime. The resignations left the defendants to their own means against the tribunal, which continued to bring witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa and his peers. Many of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony, in the presence of Shell&#x27;s lawyer.

The trial was widely criticised by human rights organisations, and six months later, Saro-Wiwa received the Right Livelihood Award for his courage, as well as the Goldman Environmental Prize.

On 8 November 1995, a military ruling council upheld the death sentences. The military government then immediately moved to carry them out. The prison in Port Harcourt was selected as the place of execution. Although the government wanted to carry out the sentences immediately, it had to wait two days for a gallows to be built. Within hours of the sentences being upheld, nine coffins were taken to the prison, and the following day a team of executioners was flown in from Sokoto to Port Harcourt.

On 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the remainder of the Ogoni Nine were taken from the army base where they were being held to Port Harcourt prison. They were told that they were being moved to Port Harcourt because it was feared that the army base they were being held in might be attacked by Ogoni youths. The prison was heavily guarded by riot police and tanks, and hundreds of people lined the streets in anticipation of the executions. After arriving at Port Harcourt prison, Saro-Wiwa and the others were herded into a single room and their wrists and ankles were shackled. They were then led one by one to the gallows and executed by hanging, with Saro-Wiwa being the first. It took five tries to execute him due to faulty equipment. His last words were: &quot;Lord take my soul, but the struggle continues.&quot; After the executions, the bodies were taken to the Port Harcourt Cemetery under armed guard and buried. Anticipating disturbances as a result of the executions, the Nigerian government deployed tens of thousands of troops and riot police to two southern provinces and major oil refineries around the country. The Port Harcourt Cemetery was surrounded by soldiers and tanks.

The executions provoked a storm of international outrage. The United Nations General Assembly condemned the executions in a resolution which passed by a vote of 101 in favor to 14 against and 47 abstentions. The European Union condemned the executions, which it called a &quot;cruel and callous act&quot;, and imposed an arms embargo on Nigeria. The United States recalled its ambassador from Nigeria, imposed an arms embargo on Nigeria, and imposed travel restrictions on members of the Nigerian military regime and their families. The United Kingdom recalled its high commissioner in Nigeria, and British Prime Minister John Major called the executions &quot;judicial murder&quot;. 

South Africa took a primary role in leading international criticism, with President Nelson Mandela urging Nigeria&#x27;s suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations. Zimbabwe and Kenya also backed Mandela, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe backing Mandela&#x27;s demand to suspend Nigeria&#x27;s Commonwealth membership, but a number of other African leaders criticized the suggestion. Nigeria&#x27;s membership in the Commonwealth of Nations was ultimately suspended, and Nigeria was threatened with expulsion if it did not transition to democracy in two years. The US and British governments also discussed the possibility of an oil embargo backed by a naval blockade of Nigeria.

=== Ken Saro-Wiwa Foundation ===
The Ken Saro-Wiwa foundation was established in 2017 to work towards improved access to basic resources such as electricity and Internet for entrepreneurs in Port Harcourt. The association founded the Ken Junior Award, named for Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s son Ken Wiwa, who died in October 2016. The award is presented to innovative start-up technology companies in Port Harcourt.

==Family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell==
Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Earth Rights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.

The cases were brought under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 statute giving non-US citizens the right to file suits in US courts for international human rights violations, and the Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows individuals to seek damages in the US for torture or extrajudicial killing, regardless of where the violations take place.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009, Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$15.5 million to victims&#x27; families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process. In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region. Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s son, was due to begin in New York.

==Legacy==
His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.

The execution of Saro-Wiwa marked the beginning of the international business and human rights (BHR) movement.

<doc id="330978" wikidata="Q259540" url="?curid=330978" title="Mass media in India">
<text>Mass media in India consists of several different means of communication: television, radio, internet, cinema, newspapers and magazines. Indian media was active since the late 18th century; the print media started in India as early as 1780. Radio broadcasting began in 1927. Today much of the media is controlled by large, corporations, which reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material.

India has over 500 satellite channels (more than 80 are news channels) and 70,000 newspapers, the biggest newspaper market in the world with over 100 million copies sold each day.

The French NGO Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organisation&#x27;s assessment of its Press Freedom Index. In its 2023 downgraded India by 11 points to 161st level out of 180 countries. Indian media freedom now stands below Afghanistan, Somalia and Columbia. It stated its reason saying &quot;The violence against journalists, the politically partisan media and the concentration of media ownership all demonstrate that press freedom is in crisis in “the world’s largest democracy”, ruled since 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the embodiment of the Hindu nationalist right.&quot; In 2022, India was ranked 150th, which declined from 133rd rank in 2016. It stated that this was due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s Bharatiya Janata Party and their followers of Hindutva having greater exertion of control of the media. Freedom House, a US-based NGO stated in its 2021 report that harassment of journalists increased under Modi&#x27;s administration. The English-language media of India are described as traditionally left-leaning liberal, which has been a point of friction recently due to an upsurge in popularity of Hindu nationalist politics. According to BBC News, &quot;A look at Indian news channels - be it English or Hindi - shows that fairly one-sided news prevails. And that side is BJP and Hindutva.&quot;

&quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot;, founded in 1780, was the first Indian newspaper. Auguste and Louis Lumière moving pictures were screened in Bombay during July 1895, and radio broadcasting began in 1927.

== Press Council of Indian act 1978 ==
Where the norms are breached and the freedom is defiled by unprofessional conduct, a way must exist to check and control it. But control by the government or official authorities may prove destructive of this freedom. Therefore, the best way is to let the peers of the profession, assisted by a few discerning laymen, regulate it through a properly structured, representative, and impartial machinery. Hence, the Press Council of India was established.

== Overview ==
The traditional print media, but also the television media, are largely family-owned and often partake in self-censorship, primarily due to political ties by the owner and the establishment. However, the new media are generally more professional and corporate-owned, though these, too, have been acquired or affiliated with established figures. At the same time, the Indian media, viewed as &quot;feisty,&quot; have also not reported on issues of the media itself.

== Print ==

The first newspaper printed in India was &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot;, started in 1780 under the British Raj by James Augustus Hicky. Other newspapers such as &quot;The India Gazette&quot;, &quot;The Calcutta Gazette&quot;, &quot;The Madras Courier&quot; (1785), and &quot;The Bombay Herald&quot; (1789) soon followed. These newspapers carried news of the areas under the British rule. The &quot;Bombay Samachar&quot;, founded in 1822 and printed in Gujarati is the oldest newspaper in Asia still in print. On 30 May 1826 &quot;Udant Martand&quot; (The Rising Sun), the first Hindi-language newspaper published in India, started from Calcutta (now Kolkata), published every Tuesday by Pt. Jugal Kishore Shukla.

Even after independence from Britain in 1947, the English-language papers were prominent due to a number of reasons. The telegraphic circuits of news agencies used the Roman Alphabet and the Morse code, giving the English press an advantage in speed. The speed of typesetting was also much slower in Indian languages because of the Diacritics. Also, the press largely relied on advertisements of imported goods for revenue, and the foreign advertisers naturally preferred English-language media. The language of the administration had also remained English.

Currently, India publishes about 1,000 Hindi dailies that have a total circulation of about 80 million copies. English, the second language in terms of a number of daily newspapers, has about 250 dailies with a circulation of about 40 million copies. The prominent Hindi newspapers are &quot;Dainik Jagran&quot;, &quot;Dainik Bhaskar&quot;, &quot;Amar Ujala&quot;, &quot;Devbhumi Mirror&quot;, &quot;Navbharat Times&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Dainik&quot;, &quot;Prabhat Khabar&quot;, &quot;Rajasthan Patrika&quot;, and &quot;Dainik Aaj&quot;.

In terms of readership, &quot;Dainik Jagran&quot; is the most popular Hindi daily with a total readership (TR) of 70,377,000, according to IRS Q1 2019. &quot;Dainik Bhaskar&quot; is the second most popular with a total readership of 51,405,000. &quot;Amar Ujala&quot; with a TR of 47,645,000, &quot;Rajasthan Patrika&quot; with a TR of 18,036,000 and &quot;Prabhat Khabar&quot; with a TR of 14,102,000 are placed at the next three positions. The total readership of the top 10 Hindi dailies is estimated at 188.68 million, nearly five times that of the top 10 English dailies that have a 38.76 million total readership.

The prominent English newspapers are &quot;The Times of India&quot;, founded in 1838 as &quot;The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce&quot; by Bennett, Coleman and Co. Ltd, a colonial enterprise now owned by an Indian conglomerate; The Times Group. &quot;The Hindustan Times&quot; was founded in 1924 during the Indian Independence Movement (&#x27;Hindustan&#x27; being the historical name of India), it is published by HT Media Ltd. &quot;The Hindu&quot; was founded in 1878 by a group known as the Triplicane Six consisting of four law students and two teachers in Madras (now Chennai), it is now owned by The Hindu Group.

In the 1950s, 214 daily newspapers were published in the country. Out of these, 44 were English language dailies while the rest were published in various regional and national languages. This number rose to 3,805 dailies in 1993 with the total number of newspapers published in the country having reached 35,595.

The main regional newspapers of India include the Marathi language &quot;Lokmat&quot;, the Gujarati Language &quot;Gujarat Samachar&quot;, the Malayalam language &quot;Malayala Manorama&quot;, the Tamil language &quot;Daily Thanthi&quot;, the Telugu language &quot;Eenadu&quot;, the Kannada language &quot;Vijaya Karnataka&quot; and the Bengali language &quot;Anandabazar Patrika&quot;.

== The Dispatch ==
The Dispatch (Jammu and Kashmir) currently, operates from Jammu and Kashmir and covers all the happening in the Northern States of India focusing on Kashmir.

Newspaper sales in the country increased by 11.22% in 2007. By 2007, 62 of the world&#x27;s best selling newspaper dailies were published in China, Japan, and India. India consumed 99 million newspaper copies as of 2007—making it the second largest market in the world for newspapers.

== Broadcasting ==

Radio broadcasting was initiated in 1927 but became a state responsibility only in 1930. In 1937 it was given the name &quot;All India Radio&quot; and since 1957 it has been called &quot;Akashvani&quot;. Limited duration of television programming began in 1959, and complete broadcasting followed in 1965. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting owned and maintained the audio-visual apparatus—including the television channel &quot;Doordarshan&quot;—in the country prior to the economic reforms of 1991. 

Following the economic reforms satellite television channels from around the world—including the BBC, CNN, CNBC, and other foreign television channels gained a foothold in the country. 47 million households with television sets emerged in 1993, which was also the year when Rupert Murdoch entered the Indian market. Satellite and cable television soon gained a foothold. &quot;Doordarshan&quot;, in turn, initiated reforms and modernisation. With 1,400 television stations as of 2009, the country ranks 4th in the list of countries by number of television broadcast stations.

== Communications ==

The Indian Government acquired ES EVM computers from the Soviet Union, which were used in large companies and research laboratories. Tata Consultancy Services – established in 1968 by the Tata Group – were the country&#x27;s largest software producers during the 1960s. The &#x27;microchip revolution&#x27; of the 1980s had convinced both Indira Gandhi and her successor Rajiv Gandhi that electronics and telecommunications were vital to India&#x27;s growth and development. MTNL underwent technological improvements. Between 1986 and 1987, the Indian government embarked upon the creation of three wide-area computer networking schemes: INDONET (intended to serve the IBM mainframes in India), NICNET (network for the National Informatics Centre), and the academic research oriented Education and Research Network (ERNET).

The Indian economy underwent economic reforms in 1991, leading to a new era of globalisation and international economic integration. Economic growth of over 6% annually was seen between 1993 and 2002. The economic reforms were driven in part by significant the internet usage in India. The new administration under Atal Bihari Vajpayee which placed the development of Information technology among its top five priorities— formed the Indian National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development. Internet gained a foothold in India by 1998. India had a total of 100 million Internet users—comprising 8.5% of the country&#x27;s population—by 2010. 

India had a total of 34 million fixed lines in use by 2011. In the fixed line arena, BSNL and MTNL are the incumbents in their respective areas of operation and continue to enjoy the dominant service provider status in the domain of fixed line services. BSNL controls 79% of fixed line share in the country.

In the mobile telephony sector, Bharti Airtel controls 24.3% subscriber base followed by Reliance Communications with 18.9%, Vodafone with 18.8%, BSNL] with 12.7% subscriber base as of June 2009. India had a total of 880 million mobile phone connections by 2011. Total fixed-line and wireless subscribers reached 688 million as of August 2010.

== Motion pictures ==
The history of film in India begins with the screening of Auguste and Louis Lumière moving pictures in Bombay during the July 1895. &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot;, a full-length feature film, was initiated in 1912 and completed later. &quot;Alam Ara&quot; (released 14 March 1931), directed by Ardeshir Irani, was the first Indian movie with dialogues.

Indian films were soon being followed throughout Southeast Asia and the Middle East—where modest dressing and subdued sexuality of these films was found to be acceptable to the sensibilities of the audience belonging to the various Islamic countries of the region. As cinema as a medium gained popularity in the country as many as 1,000 films in various languages of India were produced annually. Hollywood also gained a foothold in India with special effects films such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) being specially appreciated by the local audiences. Expatriates throughout the United Kingdom and in the United States continued to give rise to an international audiences to Indian movies, which, according to The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (2008) entry on &quot;Bollywood&quot;, &quot;continued to be formulaic story lines, expertly choreographed fight scenes, spectacular song-and-dance routines, emotion-charged melodrama, and larger-than-life heroes&quot;. Present-day India produces the most films of any country in the world. Major media investors in the country are production houses such as Yash Raj Films, Dharma Productions, Aamir Khan Productions, Disney India and Reliance Entertainment. Most of these productions are funded by investors since there are limited banking and credit facilities maturity in India for the motion picture industry. Many international corporations, such as Disney (formerly UTV) and Viacom (Network18 Studios) have entered the nation&#x27;s media industry on a large scale.

== Ownership and funding ==

Digital media is opening up to paywalls and other subscription based models. However a majority of readers still do not pay for the content they read, causing the media houses to rely on other means of funding.

&quot;Independent and Public Spirited Media Trust&quot; is a syndicate that promotes media in India with the aim of creating a news content creation network. It was founded in 2015 and funds organisations such as The Wire, IndiaSpend, CGNet Swara, Alt News, and The Caravan. Omidyar Network has invested in Scroll.in and Newslaundry. Odisha TV is owned by the Panda Family, Baijayant Jay Panda. NewsLive in Assam is run by the wife of Himanta Biswa Sarma. &quot;The Caravan&quot; points out that NDTV, News Nation, India TV, News24 and Network18 are linked to Reliance. Another Indian billionaire businessman who funds media is Subhash Chandra.

== Criticism ==

Some sections of Indian media, controlled by businessmen, Politicians, and government bureaucrats, are facing criticism for biased, motivated reporting, behave like one party owned or governing party owned and selective presentation. After the devastating earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015, in spite of India helping, tweets from Nepal trended effectively saying, &quot;Go home, Indian media&quot;. Disturbed by corruption, Delhi chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal suggested on 3 May 2015 to have a public trial of Indian media. On 8 May 2015, the then I &amp; B Minister, Arun Jaitley echoed a similar rhetoric saying that there was a, &quot;flood of channels but dearth of facts&quot;. Of late, a lot of mainstream media channels have been accused of printing and telecasting unverified and biased news which they retracted later. In a few instances content from Twitter&#x27;s parody accounts were cited as a source. Indian mainstream media has often been accused of showing sensationalized news items. In March 2018, the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said that, &quot;journalists cannot write anything they imagine and behave as if they are sitting in some pulpit&quot;. Godi media is a pejorative term coined &amp; popularised by former NDTV journalist Ravish Kumar referring to the sensationalist and biased Indian mainstream media which supports the ruling party of India.

Chief Justice of India N. V. Ramana criticized Indian media in a speech in July 2022 accusing the media of running Kangaroo courts and running agenda driven debates without any accountability, which he thinks is bad for democracy.

A report by Oxfam and Newslaundry found out that employees from general category constitute around 90% of leadership positions in the Indian media, which means that the marginalized communities like Dalits, Adivasis and Bahujans do not have adequate representation.

<text>Jap is an English abbreviation of the word &quot;Japanese&quot;. In the United States, some Japanese Americans have come to find the term offensive because of the internment they suffered during World War II. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Jap&quot; was not considered primarily offensive. However, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Japanese declaration of war on the US, the term began to be used derogatorily, as anti-Japanese sentiment increased. During the war, signs using the epithet, with messages such as &quot;No Japs Allowed&quot;, were hung in some businesses, with service denied to customers of Japanese descent.

==History and etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Jap&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;Japanese&quot; was in colloquial use in London around 1880. An example of benign usage was the previous naming of Boondocks Road in Jefferson County, Texas, originally named Jap Road when it was built in 1905 to honor a popular local rice farmer from Japan.

Later popularized during World War II to describe those of Japanese descent, &quot;Jap&quot; was then commonly used in newspaper headlines to refer to the Japanese and Imperial Japan. &quot;Jap&quot; began to be used in a derogatory fashion during the war, more so than &quot;Nip&quot;. Veteran and author Paul Fussell explains the rhetorical usefulness of the word during the war for creating effective propaganda by saying that &quot;Japs&quot; &quot;was a brisk monosyllable handy for slogans like &#x27;Rap the Jap&#x27; or &#x27;Let&#x27;s Blast the Jap Clean Off the Map&#x27;&quot;. Some in the United States Marine Corps tried to combine the word &quot;Japs&quot; with &quot;apes&quot; to create a new description, &quot;&quot;, for the Japanese; this neologism never became popular.

In the United States, the term has now been considered derogatory; the &quot;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&quot; notes it is &quot;disparaging&quot;. A snack food company in Chicago named Japps Foods (for the company founder) changed their name and eponymous potato chip brand to Jays Foods shortly after the Attack on Pearl Harbor to avoid any negative associations with Japan.

Spiro Agnew was criticized in the media in 1968 for an offhand remark referring to reporter Gene Oishi as a &quot;fat Jap&quot;.

In Texas, under pressure from civil rights groups, Jefferson County commissioners in 2004 decided to drop the name Jap Road from a road near the city of Beaumont. In adjacent Orange County, Jap Lane has also been targeted by civil rights groups. The road was originally named for the contributions of Kichimatsu Kishi and the farming colony he founded. In Arizona, the state department of transportation renamed Jap Road near Topock, Arizona to &quot;Bonzai Slough Road&quot; to note the presence of Japanese agricultural workers and family-owned farms along the Colorado River there in the early 20th century. In November 2018, in Kansas, automatically generated license plates which included three digits and &quot;JAP&quot; were recalled after a man of Japanese ancestry saw a plate with that pattern and complained to the state.

==Reaction in Japan==

Koto Matsudaira, Japan&#x27;s Permanent Representatives to the United Nations, was asked whether he disapproved of the use of the term on a television program in June 1957, and reportedly replied, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s English word. It&#x27;s maybe American slang. I don&#x27;t know. If you care, you are free to use it.&quot; Matsudaira later received a letter from the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), and apologized for his earlier remarks upon being interviewed by reporters from Honolulu and San Francisco. He then pledged cooperation with the JACL to help eliminate the term &quot;Jap&quot; from daily use.

In 2003, the Japanese deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Yoshiyuki Motomura, protested the North Korean ambassador&#x27;s use of the term in retaliation for a Japanese diplomat&#x27;s use of the term &quot;North Korea&quot; instead of the official name, &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot;.

In 2011, after the term&#x27;s use in a March 26 article appearing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; (&quot;white-coated Jap &quot;), the Minister of the Japanese Embassy in London protested that &quot;most Japanese people find the word &#x27;Japs&#x27; offensive, irrespective of the circumstances in which it is used&quot;.

==Around the world==
Jap-Fest is an annual Japanese car show in Ireland. In 1970, the Japanese fashion designer Kenzo Takada opened the Jungle Jap boutique in Paris.

In Singapore,the term is used relatively frequently as a contraction of the adjective &quot;Japanese&quot; rather than as a derogatory term. It is also used in Australia, particularly for Japanese cars and Japanese pumpkin. In New Zealand, the phrase is a non-pejorative contraction of &quot;Japanese&quot;, although the phrase &quot;Jap crap&quot; is used to describe poor-quality Japanese vehicles.

The word &quot;Jap&quot; is used in Dutch as well, where it is also considered an ethnic slur. It frequently appears in the compound &quot;Jappenkampen&quot; &#x27;Jap camps&#x27;, referring to Japanese internment camps for Dutch citizens in the Japanese-occupied Dutch Indies.

In Brazil, the term &quot;&quot; is sometimes used in place of the standard &quot;&quot; as a noun and adjective. Its use may be inappropriate in formal contexts. The use of &quot;japa&quot; in reference to any person of East Asian appearance, regardless of their ancestry, can be pejorative.

In Canada, the term &quot;Jap Oranges&quot; was once very common, and was not considered derogatory, given the widespread Canadian tradition of eating imported Japanese-grown oranges at Christmas dating back to the 1880s (to the degree that Canada at one time imported by far the bulk of the Japanese orange crop each year), but after WW2 as consumers were still hesitant to purchase products from Japan the term &quot;Jap&quot; was gradually dropped and they began to be marketed as &quot;Mandarin Oranges&quot;. Today the term &quot;Jap Oranges&quot; is typically only used by older Canadians.

In the UK, the term is variously seen as neutral or offensive. For instance, Paul McCartney used the term in his 1980 instrumental song &quot;Frozen Jap&quot; from &quot;McCartney II&quot;, maintaining that he had not intended to cause offense; the song&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Frozen Japanese&quot; for the Japanese market. &quot;Nip&quot; is the term that is usually used in the UK when the intention is to cause offence.

In Finnish, the term japsi (pronounced yahpsi) is frequently used colloquially for anything Japanese with no derogatory meaning, similar to how the term jenkki is used for anything American.

<doc id="330981" wikidata="Q188392" url="?curid=330981" title="Tau (particle)">
<text>The tau (), also called the tau lepton, tau particle or tauon, is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative electric charge and a spin of. Like the electron, the muon, and the three neutrinos, the tau is a lepton, and like all elementary particles with half-integer spin, the tau has a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge but equal mass and spin. In the tau&#x27;s case, this is the &quot;antitau&quot; (also called the &quot;positive tau&quot;). Tau particles are denoted by the symbol and the antitaus by .

Tau leptons have a lifetime of and a mass of /&quot;c&quot;2 (compared to /&quot;c&quot;2 for muons and /&quot;c&quot;2 for electrons). Since their interactions are very similar to those of the electron, a tau can be thought of as a &quot;much&quot; heavier version of the electron. Because of their greater mass, tau particles do not emit as much bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) as electrons; consequently they are potentially much more highly penetrating than electrons.

Because of its short lifetime, the range of the tau is mainly set by its decay length, which is too small for bremsstrahlung to be noticeable. Its penetrating power appears only at ultra-high velocity and energy (above petaelectronvolt energies), when time dilation extends its otherwise very short path-length.

As with the case of the other charged leptons, the tau has an associated tau neutrino, denoted by .

== History ==
The search for tau started in 1960 at CERN by the Bologna-CERN-Frascati (BCF) group led by Antonino Zichichi. Zichichi came up with the idea of a new sequential heavy lepton, now called tau, and invented a method of search. He performed the experiment at the ADONE facility in 1969 once its accelerator became operational; however, the accelerator he used did not have enough energy to search for the tau particle.

The tau was independently anticipated in a 1971 article by Yung-su Tsai. Providing the theory for this discovery, the tau was detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his and Tsai&#x27;s colleagues at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) group. Their equipment consisted of SLAC&#x27;s then-new electron–positron colliding ring, called SPEAR, and the LBL magnetic detector. They could detect and distinguish between leptons, hadrons, and photons. They did not detect the tau directly, but rather discovered anomalous events:

The need for at least two undetected particles was shown by the inability to conserve energy and momentum with only one. However, no other muons, electrons, photons, or hadrons were detected. It was proposed that this event was the production and subsequent decay of a new particle pair:

This was difficult to verify, because the energy to produce the pair is similar to the threshold for D meson production. The mass and spin of the tau were subsequently established by work done at DESY-Hamburg with the Double Arm Spectrometer (DASP), and at SLAC-Stanford with the SPEAR Direct Electron Counter (DELCO),

The symbol was derived from the Greek (&quot;triton&quot;, meaning &quot;third&quot; in English), since it was the third charged lepton discovered.

Martin Lewis Perl shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics with Frederick Reines. The latter was awarded his share of the prize for the experimental discovery of the neutrino.

== Tau decay ==
The tau is the only lepton with enough mass to decay into hadrons. Like the leptonic decay modes of the tau, the hadronic decay is through the weak interaction.

The branching fractions of the dominant hadronic tau decays are:
* 25.49% for decay into a charged pion, a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino;
* 10.82% for decay into a charged pion and a tau neutrino;
* 9.26% for decay into a charged pion, two neutral pions, and a tau neutrino;
* 8.99% for decay into three charged pions (of which two have the same electrical charge) and a tau neutrino;
* 2.74% for decay into three charged pions (of which two have the same electrical charge), a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino;
* 1.04% for decay into three neutral pions, a charged pion, and a tau neutrino.

In total, the tau lepton will decay hadronically approximately 64.79% of the time.

The branching fractions of the common purely leptonic tau decays are:
* 17.82% for decay into a tau neutrino, electron and electron antineutrino;
* 17.39% for decay into a tau neutrino, muon, and muon antineutrino.
The similarity of values of the two branching fractions is a consequence of lepton universality.

== Exotic atoms ==
The tau lepton is predicted to form exotic atoms like other charged subatomic particles. One of such consists of an antitau and an electron: , called &quot;tauonium&quot;.

Another one is an onium atom called &quot;ditauonium&quot; or &quot;true tauonium&quot;, which is a challenge to detect due to the difficulty to form it from two (opposite-sign) short-lived tau leptons.
Its experimental detection would be an interesting test of quantum electrodynamics.

<text>Owen McMahon Johnson (August 27, 1878 – January 27, 1952) was an American writer best remembered for his stories and novels cataloguing the educational and personal growth of the fictional character &quot;Dink Stover&quot;. The &quot;Lawrenceville Stories&quot; (&quot;The Prodigious Hickey,&quot; &quot;The Tennessee Shad&quot;, &quot;The Varmint&quot;, &quot;Skippy Bedelle&quot;, &quot;The Hummingbird&quot;), set in the well-known prep school, invite comparison with Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; A 1950 film, &quot;The Happy Years&quot;, and a 1987 PBS mini-series, &quot;The Lawrenceville Stories&quot;, were based on them.

==Biography==
He was born in New York City, the son of Robert Underwood Johnson and his wife Katharine, née McMahon, and attended Lawrenceville School, founding and editing the &quot;Lawrenceville Literary Magazine&quot;, known as &quot;The Lit&quot;. He attended Yale University, as a member of the Class of 1900, graduating in 1901, marrying Mary Galt Stockly and moving to Paris, where he did his initial writing. He was a war correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; during World War I.

His first wife died in 1910. His married his second wife Esther Ellen Cobb (better known as Cobina Wright Sr.) in 1912 and divorced in 1917. His third wife was Cecile Denise de la Garde, who died in 1918. His fourth wife was Catherine Sayre Burton, who died in 1923. His fifth wife was Gertrude Bovee Le Boutillier. He was the father of five children.

Johnson worked and resided in Stockbridge, Massachusetts from 1923 to 1948, writing about marriage, divorce, and golf. After 1931, his writing activities became less intense, and he became interested in politics, running (unsuccessfully) for the House of Representatives in 1936 and 1938.

He died at his home in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, where he had lived for five years.
