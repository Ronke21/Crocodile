<text>Plan Colombia was a United States foreign aid, military aid, and diplomatic initiative aimed at combating Colombian drug cartels and left-wing insurgent groups. The plan was originally conceived in 1999 by the administrations of Colombian President Andrés Pastrana and U.S. President Bill Clinton, and signed into law in the United States in 2000.

The official objectives of Plan Colombia were to end the Colombian armed conflict by increasing funding and training of Colombian military and para-military forces and creating an anti-cocaine strategy to eradicate coca cultivation. Partly as a result of the plan, the FARC lost much of its power against the Colombian government. Sources conflict on its effects limiting cocaine production, however. US reports conclude that cocaine production in Colombia dropped 72% from 2001 to 2012, contradicting UN sources which found no change in cocaine production.

Plan Colombia in its initial form existed until 2015, with the United States and the Colombian government seeking a new strategy as a result of the peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC. The new program is called &quot;Peace Colombia&quot; (Paz Colombia) and seeks to provide Colombia with aid after the implementation of the Peace Agreement in 2017 with the FARC.

==Original Plan Colombia==
The original version of Plan Colombia was officially unveiled by President Andrés Pastrana in 1999. Pastrana had first proposed the idea of a possible &quot;Marshall Plan for Colombia&quot; during a speech at Bogotá&#x27;s Tequendama Hotel on June 8, 1998, nearly a week after the first round of that year&#x27;s presidential elections. Pastrana argued that:

[Drug crops are] a social problem whose solution must pass through the solution to the armed conflict...Developed countries should help us to implement some sort of &#x27;Marshall Plan&#x27; for Colombia, which will allow us to develop great investments in the social field, in order to offer our peasants different alternatives to the illicit crops.

After Pastrana was inaugurated, one of the names given to the initiative at this early stage was &quot;Plan for Colombia&#x27;s Peace&quot;, which President Pastrana defined as &quot;a set of alternative development projects which will channel the shared efforts of multilateral organizations and [foreign] governments towards Colombian society&quot;. Pastrana&#x27;s Plan Colombia, as originally presented, did not focus on drug trafficking, military aid, or fumigation, but instead emphasized the manual eradication of drug crops as a better alternative. According to author Doug Stokes, one of the earlier versions of the plan called for an estimated 55 per cent military aid and 45 percent developmental aid.

During an August 3, 1998 meeting, President Pastrana and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed the possibility of &quot;securing an increase in U.S. aid for counternarcotics projects, sustainable economic development, the protection of human rights, humanitarian aid, stimulating private investment, and joining other donors and international financial institutions to promote Colombia&#x27;s economic growth&quot;. Diplomatic contacts regarding this subject continued during the rest of the year and into 1999.

For President Pastrana, it became necessary to create an official document that specifically &quot;served to convene important U.S. aid, as well as that of other countries and international organizations&quot; by adequately addressing US concerns. The Colombian government also considered that it had to patch up a bilateral relationship that had heavily deteriorated during the previous administration of President Ernesto Samper (1994–1998). According to Pastrana, Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering eventually suggested that, initially, the U.S. could be able to commit to providing aid over a three-year period, as opposed to continuing with separate yearly packages.

As a result of these contacts, US input was extensive, and meant that Plan Colombia&#x27;s first formal draft was originally written in English, not Spanish, and a Spanish version was not available until &quot;months after a revised English version was already in place&quot;.
Critics and observers have referred to the differences between the earliest versions of Plan Colombia and later drafts. Originally, the focus was on achieving peace and ending violence, within the context of the ongoing peace talks that Pastrana&#x27;s government was then holding with the FARC guerrillas, following the principle that the country&#x27;s violence had &quot;deep roots in the economic exclusion and...inequality and poverty&quot;.

The final version of Plan Colombia was seen as considerably different, since its main focuses would deal with drug trafficking and strengthening the military. When this final version was debated on the U.S. Senate floor, Joseph Biden spoke as a leading advocate of the more hardline strategy.

Ambassador Robert White stated:

If you read the original Plan Colombia, not the one that was written in Washington but the original Plan Colombia, there&#x27;s no mention of military drives against the FARC rebels. Quite the contrary. (President Pastrana) says the FARC is part of the history of Colombia and a historical phenomenon, he says, and they must be treated as Colombians...[Colombians] come and ask for bread and you (America) give them stones.

In the final U.S. aid package, 78.12 percent of the funds for 2000 went to the Colombian military and police for counternarcotics and military operations. &quot;(See graph, below)&quot;

President Pastrana admitted that most of the resulting US aid to Colombia was overwhelmingly focused on the military and on counternarcotics (68%), but argued that this was only some 17% of the total amount of estimated Plan Colombia aid. The rest, focusing mostly on social development, would be provided by international organizations, Europe, Japan, Canada, Latin America, and Colombia itself. In light of this, Pastrana considered that the Plan had been unfairly labeled as &quot;militarist&quot; by national and international critics that focused only on the US contribution.

==Financing==
This original plan called for a budget of US$7.5 billion, with 51% dedicated to institutional and social development, 32% for fighting the drug trade, 16% for economic and social revitalization, and 0.8% to support the then on-going effort to negotiate a political solution to the state&#x27;s conflict with insurgent guerrilla groups. Pastrana initially pledged US$4.864 billion of Colombian resources (65% of the total) and called on the international community to provide the remaining US$2.636 billion (35%). Most of this funding was earmarked for training and equipping new Colombian army counternarcotics battalions, providing them with helicopters, transport and intelligence assistance, and supplies for coca eradication.

In 2000, the Clinton administration in the United States supported the initiative by committing $1.3 billion in foreign aid and up to five hundred military personnel to train local forces. An additional three hundred civilian personnel were allowed to assist in the eradication of coca. This aid was an addition to US$330 million of previously approved US aid to Colombia. US$818 million was earmarked for 2000, with US$256 million for 2001. These appropriations for the plan made Colombia the third largest recipient of foreign aid from the United States at the time, behind only Israel and Egypt. Under President George W. Bush, aid to Colombia earmarked for military aid vs. humanitarian aid became more balanced. Ultimately, the U.S. would provide approximately US$10 billion under Plan Colombia through 2015.

Colombia sought additional support from the European Union and other countries, with the intention of financing the mostly social component of the original plan. Some would-be donors were reluctant to cooperate, as they considered that the US-approved aid represented an undue military slant, and additionally lacked the will to spend such amounts of money for what they considered an uncertain initiative.

Initially, some of these countries donated approximately US$128.6 million (in one year), which was 2.3% of the resulting total. Larger amounts, in some instances up to several hundred million dollars, were also donated to Colombia and continued to be provided either directly or through loans and access to credit lines, but technically fell outside the framework of Plan Colombia. &quot;European countries provide economic and social development funds but do not consider them to be in support of Plan Colombia.&quot; In any case, the sums raised fell well short of what was originally called for. In addition, Colombia&#x27;s eventual contribution was less than planned due in part to a 1999–2001 economic crisis.

== War on drugs ==
In the United States, Plan Colombia is seen as part of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;, which was started under President Nixon in 1971. Plan Colombia has numerous supporters in the United States Congress. Congressional supporters assert that over 1,300 square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia in 2003, which would have prevented the production of over 500 metric tons of cocaine, stating that it eliminated upward of $100 million of the illicit income that supports drug dealers and different illegal organizations considered terrorist in Colombia, the U.S. and the European Union.

According to a 2006 U.S. congressional report on U.S. enterprises that had signed contracts to carry out anti-narcotics activities as part of Plan Colombia, DynCorp, the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department.

==Expansion under Bush ==
As enacted in 2000, Plan Colombia called for two U.S. supported actions in Colombia. The first was to cause the “eradication, interdiction, and alternative development” of coca fields which are used to produce cocaine—which in turn provided most of the funding for the FARC. And second, to offer social and economic assistance to the rural areas that the FARC have controlled for half a century.

A third more security oriented countermeasure—to provide enhanced intelligence, training and supplies to Colombian armed forces against the FARC—took greater importance post 9/11 under the Andean Regional Initiative, as the threat of global terrorism received increased attention. The Andean Regional Initiative initially appropriated $676 million to South American countries, with approximately $380 million targeted at Colombia. The 2001 initiative reduced the limitations on the numbers and the activities of civilian contractors, allowing them to carry and use military weapons which, according to the U.S. government, would be necessary to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment during spray missions. The United States Congress rejected amendments to the Andean initiative that would have redirected some of the money to demand reduction programs in the United States, primarily through funding of drug treatment services. Some critics have opposed the rejection of these modifications, claiming that the drug problem and its multiple repercussions would be structurally addressed by curbing the demand, and not the production, of illicit drugs, since drug crops can always be regrown and transplanted elsewhere, inside or outside Colombia and its neighboring countries, as long as there is a commercially viable market.

In 2004, the United States appropriated approximately $727 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, $463 million of which was targeted at Colombia.

In October 2004, the compromise version of two U.S. House–Senate bills was approved, increasing the number of U.S. military advisors that operate in the country as part of Plan Colombia to 800 (from 400) and that of private contractors to 600 (from 400).

In a November 22, 2004 visit to Cartagena, President Bush stood by Colombian president Uribe&#x27;s security policies and declared his support for continuing to provide Plan Colombia aid in the future. Bush claimed the initiative enjoys &quot;wide bipartisan support&quot; in the US and in the coming year he would ask Congress to renew its support.

Taken together then, the three countermeasures represent what President George W. Bush referred to as his “three-legged stool” strategy of “waging a global war on terror, supporting democracy and reducing the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.” Although Plan Colombia includes components which address social aid and institutional reform, the initiative has come to be regarded by its critics as fundamentally a program of counternarcotics and military aid for the Colombian government.

==Criticism==

===Research studies===
The US Defense Department funded a two-year study which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have minimal or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, &quot;Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction,&quot; was prepared by seven economists, mathematicians and researchers at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the RAND Corporation and released in 1988. The study noted that seven previous studies in the past nine years, including ones by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts, using current armed forces resources, would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.

During the early to mid-1990s, the Clinton administration ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use. President Clinton&#x27;s Director of National Drug Control Policy rejected slashing law enforcement spending.

Plan Colombia itself didn&#x27;t exist at the time of the second RAND study, but the U.S. aid package has been criticized as a manifestation of the predominant law enforcement approach to the drug trade as a whole.

===Guerrillas and oil===
Critics of Plan Colombia, such as authors Doug Stokes and Francisco Ramirez Cuellar, argue that the main intent of the program is not drug eradication but to fight leftist guerrillas. They argue that these Colombian peasants are also a target because they are calling for social reform and hindering international plans to exploit Colombia&#x27;s valuable resources, including oil and other natural resources. As of 2004, Colombia is the fifteenth largest supplier of oil to the United States and could potentially rise in that ranking if petroleum extraction could be conducted in a more secure environment. From 1986 to 1997 there were nearly of crude oil spilled in pipeline attacks. Damage and lost revenue were estimated at $1.5 billion, while the oil spills seriously damaged the ecology.

While the assistance is defined as counternarcotics assistance, critics such as filmmaker Gerard Ungeman argues it will be used primarily against the FARC. Supporters of the Plan such as the U.S. embassy in Bogotá and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman argue that the distinction between guerrillas, paramilitaries and drug dealers may have increasingly become irrelevant, seeing as they could be considered as part of the same productive chain. As a result, counternarcotics assistance and equipment should also be available for use against any of these irregular armed groups when necessary.

===Human rights conditions===
In June 2000, Amnesty International issued a press release in which it criticized the implemented Plan Colombia initiative:

Plan Colombia is based on a drug-focused analysis of the roots of the conflict and the human rights crisis which completely ignores the Colombian state&#x27;s own historical and current responsibility. It also ignores deep-rooted causes of the conflict and the human rights crisis. The Plan proposes a principally military strategy (in the US component of Plan Colombia) to tackle illicit drug cultivation and trafficking through substantial military assistance to the Colombian armed forces and police. Social development and humanitarian assistance programs included in the Plan cannot disguise its essentially military character. Furthermore, it is apparent that Plan Colombia is not the result of a genuine process of consultation either with the national and international non-governmental organizations which are expected to implement the projects nor with the beneficiaries of the humanitarian, human rights or social development projects. As a consequence, the human rights component of Plan Colombia is seriously flawed. 

During the late 1990s, Colombia was the leading recipient of US military aid in the Western Hemisphere, and due to its continuing internal conflict has the worst human rights record, with the majority of atrocities attributed (from most directly responsible to least directly responsible) to paramilitary forces, insurgent guerrilla groups and elements within the police and armed forces.

A United Nations study reported that elements within the Colombian security forces, which have been strengthened due to Plan Colombia and U.S. aid, do continue to maintain intimate relationships with right-wing death squads, help organize paramilitary forces, and either participate in abuses and massacres directly or, as it is usually argued to be more often the case, deliberately fail to take action to prevent them. One of the larger examples of this behavior was the 2008 False Positives Scandal, in which the Colombian military murdered approximately 1,400 innocent civilians in order to make false claims that these cadavers were Farc soldiers.

Critics of the Plan and of other initiatives to aid Colombian armed forces point to these continuing accusations of serious abuse, and argue that the Colombian state and military should sever any persisting relationship with these illegal forces and need to prosecute past offenses by paramilitary forces or its own personnel. Supporters of the Plan assert that the number and scale of abuses directly attributable to the government&#x27;s forces have been slowly but increasingly reduced.

Some paramilitary commanders openly expressed their support for Plan Colombia. In May 2000, paramilitary commander &quot;Yair&quot; from the Putumayo Southern Bloc, himself a former Colombian special forces sergeant, said that the AUC supported the plan and he offered to assist U.S.-trained counternarcotics battalions in their operations against the FARC in the coca-growing Putumayo department. Paramilitaries and FARC fought it out in the region one month before a Plan Colombia mandated military offensive began later that year. AUC fighters would have passed through checkpoints manned by the army&#x27;s 24th Brigade in the area during the fighting.

====SOA and human rights====
According to Grace Livingstone, more Colombian School of the Americas (SOA) graduates have been implicated in human rights abuses than SOA graduates from any other country. All of the commanders of the brigades highlighted in the 2001 Human Rights Watch report were graduates of the SOA, including the III brigade in Valle del Cauca, where the 2001 Alto Naya Massacre occurred. US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in many atrocities during the 1990s, including the Massacre of Trujillo and the 1997 Mapiripán Massacre.

In addition, Livingstone also argues that the Colombian paramilitaries employ counter insurgency methods that US military schools and manuals have been teaching Latin American officers in Colombia and in the region at large since the 1960s, and that these manuals teach students to target civilian supporters of the guerrillas, because without such support the guerrillas cannot survive.

The Pastrana administration replied to critics by stating that it had publicly denounced military-paramilitary links, as well as increased efforts against paramilitaries and acted against questionable military personnel. President Pastrana argues that he implemented new training courses on human rights and on international law for military and police officers, as well as new reforms to limit the jurisdiction of military courts in cases of grave human rights abuses such as torture, genocide or forced disappearances.

Pastrana claims that some 1300 paramilitaries were killed, captured or surrendered during his term, and that hundreds of members of the armed forces, including up to a hundred officers, were dismissed due to the existence of what it considered as sufficient allegations of involvement in abuses or suspected paramilitary activities, in use of a new presidential discretional faculty. These would include some 388 discharges in 2000 and a further 70 in 2001. Human Rights Watch recognized these events, but questioned the fact that the reasons for such discharges were not always made clear nor followed by formal prosecutions, and claimed that Pastrana&#x27;s administration cut funds for the Attorney General&#x27;s Human Rights Unit.

====Leahy Provision====
In 1997 the US Congress approved an Amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act which banned the US from giving anti-narcotics aid to any foreign military unit whose members have violated human rights. The Amendment was called the &quot;Leahy Provision&quot; or &quot;Leahy Law&quot; (named after Senator Patrick Leahy who proposed it). Partially due to this measure and the reasoning behind it, anti-narcotics aid was initially only provided to Police units, and not to the military during much of the 1990s.

According to author Grace Livingstone and other critics, the problem is there have been very few military units free of members that have not been implicated in any kind of human rights abuses at all, so they consider that the policy has been usually ignored, downplayed or occasionally implemented in a patchy way. In 2000, Human Rights Watch, together with several Colombian human rights investigators, published a study in which it concluded that half of Colombia&#x27;s eighteen brigade-level army units had extensive links to paramilitaries at the time, citing numerous cases which directly or indirectly implicated army personnel.

The State Department certified that Colombia would have complied with one of the human rights conditions (Sec. 3201) attached to Plan Colombia aid, due to President Pastrana&#x27;s directing &quot;in writing that Colombian Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights will be brought to justice in Colombia&#x27;s civilian courts...&quot;. In August 2000 President Clinton used his presidential waiver to override the remaining human rights conditions, on the grounds that it was necessary for the interests of U.S. national security. Livingstone argues that if the US government funds military units guilty of human rights abuses, it is acting illegally.

===Aerial eradication strategy===
Aerial eradication, also referred to as fumigation, was implemented as a part of Plan Colombia, strongly supported by the United States government, as a strategy to eliminate drug crops in Colombia starting in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, drug cultivation had increased and Colombia supplied up to 90% of the world&#x27;s cocaine, which intensified aerial eradication efforts. United States policymakers advocated for the extensive use of the herbicide Roundup Ultra created by Monsanto for large-scale aerial spraying of illicit crops in Colombia.

Between 2000 and 2003, the aerial eradication program sprayed over 380,000 hectares of coca, accounting for more than 8% of Colombia&#x27;s cultivatable land. This program was led by the Colombian Antinarcotics Directorate (DIRAN), police units responsible for the oversight of aerial spraying operations. By 2003, the program included twenty-four aircraft devoted to eradication with the addition of armed helicopters providing security against ground fire from armed groups including FARC and other organizations active in drug cultivation locals.

=== Aerial eradication Criticisms ===

The practice of forced eradication of illicit crops through aerial spraying has been criticized for its effectiveness in reducing the drug supply as well as having negative social and environmental impacts. According to the Transnational Institute, &quot;the fact that an increasing crop area is being eradicated – much more was sprayed in 2003 than in 2002 – should be interpreted not as a sign of the policy&#x27;s success, but as a sign of its failure, because it indicates that more and more land is being planted in these crops.&quot; According to Joshua Davis of Wired.com, the area has seen the emergence of a Roundup resistant variety of the coca plant known as &quot;Boliviana Negra&quot; that is not talked about because it might &quot;put an end to American aid money&quot;, depicting the ecological adaptation resulting from this operation.

The aerial eradication strategy in Colombia has been a highly controversial approach in the nation&#x27;s efforts to combat coca cultivation and the subsequent illicit drug trade. The strategies implementation of herbicides, specifically glyphosate, through aerial aircraft spraying was targeted towards coca crops, the raw material for cocaine production. The effectiveness and consequences have been a subject of large debate. In 2004, according to Robert Charles, assistant secretary of state for the INL, aerial eradication efforts were getting close to the point that continued suppression of the drug crops would convince growers that continued cultivation will be futile. Despite this perspective, statistics show that sharp reductions in growing caused by fumigation in 2002–2003 did not reduce cultivation levels back to their numbers in 1998, and on top of that, Colombia still remains the largest coca-growing country in the world.

Another reason to remain skeptical of the success of this program is the &quot;balloon effect&quot;, where when one part of an industry is pressured it will be resolved in another area. In the context of aerial eradication, when drug cultivation was halted in one area, it would simply appear in another area, which would in turn reverse the intended effects of fumigation. As a result, coca farming has spread throughout Colombia, and the Colombian government even reported that between 1999 and 2002, the number of provinces where coca was being grown rose from twelve to twenty-two. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also presented research on coca cultivation in Colombia which showed this crop&#x27;s high degree of mobility and its increases of cultivation in ten provinces. For example, in the province Guaviare, coca cultivation moved south toward Caquetá and Putumayo as a result of aerial eradication in the 1990s, and thus cultivation rose 55 percent.
Another issue raised by aerial eradication is rights violations as aerial eradication destroys one of the few economic options for a number of peasants and causes forced displacement because peasants have to find a new place to grow their crops.

One notable aspect in discussion of the aerial spraying of illicit crops in Colombia is the size of the areas sprayed. In Putumayo alone, forty thousand hectares are said to have been sprayed in a single department. On a national scale in 2003, chemicals were sprayed on 139,000 hectares, contributing to the displacement of approximately 17,000 people. The displacements led to threats of local livelihoods and food insecurity.

The broader implications of aerial eradication efforts have been recorded by Colombia&#x27;s Council for Human Rights and Displacement, which reported between 2001 and 2002, aerial eradication displaced 75,000 people nationwide. The use of glyphosate, a potent herbicide, sparked concerns about its effects on human health and the environment. The scale of the operation suggests that there must be modification to the landscape which has consequences doe flora and fauna in the affected regions. The long-term effects on the residents of the sprayed areas are a matter of growing study and concern. These studies bring up the multifaceted nature of Plan Colombia, specifically aerial spraying in human and environmental health.

In addition to the previous criticisms, spraying has been associated with significant health concerns among residents in the affected areas. Reports have indicated that individuals living in these areas have a range of health issues including skin reactions, respiratory problems, and other ailments. This has sparked controversy with the United States due to the U.S. government&#x27;s downplaying of the severity of the health risks. The officials had argued that illnesses arise as a result of the herbicides used by local farmers for individual crop control and cultivation rather than the aerial spraying operations.

To further the divide, the EPA provided the State Department with the assessments of health and environmental impacts of aerial eradication, however these assessments were conducted without specific testing measures of the local Colombian environment. The State Department did not provide sufficient evidence to the EPA on the delivery and mechanics of the spraying operations. In terms of environmental effects, because of the &quot;balloon effect&quot;, farmers moved their crop cultivation into forests and national parks, resulting in, deforestation, pollution of soil, pollution of waterways, and even increased risk of extinction for Colombian bird and plant species.
Aside from these specific issues, there are also others raised about the costs of fumigation and if it is utilizing too much of the budgetary spending.

This intensive program to eradicate crops with aerial spraying is the backbone of the bilateral anti-drug partnership between Colombia and United States making this program integral to both nations interactions.

====Proposed use of mycoherbicides====
In 1999, the U.S. Congress added a provision to its Plan Colombia aid package that called for the employment of mycoherbicides against coca and opium crops. The potential use of &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; as part of these efforts was questioned and opposed by environmentalists. Colombia rejected the proposal and the Clinton administration waived the provision in light of continued criticism.

==Military programs==
Compared to the counternarcotics measures, the military campaign waged against the FARC and other paramilitaries appears to have achieved more success. Military aid packages that were both part of, and separate from, Plan Colombia have successfully driven the FARC out of most of their former territory and targeted the leaders of the insurgency, killing over two dozen of them. The U.S. has largely remained in a non-combatant role, providing real time intelligence, training, and military equipment.

As the Colombian military (with U.S. support) continues to crack down on the FARC during the mid-2000s, the insurgency was sapped of much of their military might. Traditionally, the FARC has operated with a centralized, hierarchical command structure and a governing body called the Secretariat. With the deaths in 2008 of main leader Manuel Marulanda and second-in-command Raúl Reyes, followed by the killing of top tacticians Mono Jojoy and Alfonso Cano in 2010 and 2011, the group became increasingly disjointed. In 2001, for example, the FARC had over 18,000 fighters, but that figure fell to under 7,000 by 2014 mainly as a result of fighters abandoning the cause. In terms of land, the FARC once controlled a DMZ the size of Switzerland in 1999 and had encircled the capital of Bogota, yet they were subsequently pushed back to the southern highlands of the country and into the surrounding borders of Ecuador and Bolivia. As a result, FARC attacks in Colombia have declined significantly. Bombings on Occidental Petroleum&#x27;s Caño Limón pipeline—a frequent target of the FARC—for instance, reached 178 separate incidents in 2001 compared to just 57 in 2007.

Even as the FARC have lost power and subsequently signed a peace agreement, there is concern about what will happen to the remnants of the group. One fear is that autonomous fronts will forge their own relationships with the cartels and continue the drug trade in a more dispersed manner.

* National Police Eradication Program (2000–2008 cost: $458 million)
** This program is executed by a private company, DynCorp, under the supervision of the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and operates out of Patrick Space Force Base in Florida. U.S. State Department-owned planes spray chemicals to destroy coca and opium poppy crops in rural Colombia. From 2000 to 2008, more than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of crops were destroyed.
*** 13 Air Tractor AT-802 armored crop dusters
*** 13 Bell UH-1N helicopters
*** 4 Alenia C-27 cargo planes
* National Police Interdiction Efforts (2000–2008 cost: $153 million)
** The U.S. State Department equips and trains a Colombian National Police unit known as Junglas. The unit&#x27;s 500 members are divided into three companies based in Bogotá, Santa Marta, and Tuluá.
* Infrastructure Security Strategy (2000–2008 cost: $115 million)
** This program secures part of the Cano Limon-Covenas Pipeline, benefiting international oil company Occidental Petroleum. Its air component has 2 Sikorsky UH-60 and 8 Bell UH-1H (Huey II) helicopters. Its ground component includes U.S. Special Forces training and equipment for 1,600 Colombian Army soldiers.
* Army Ground Forces (2000–2008 cost: $104 million)
** Joint Task Force Omega

* Police Presence in Conflict Zones (2000–2008 cost: $92 million)
** This program aims to establish government presence in all Colombian municipalities. Fifteen percent of Colombian municipalities had no police presence in 2002. Today all municipalities are covered, but in many of them government presence is limited to a small number of policemen. The program organized 68 squadrons of Carabineros, of 120 policemen each. The U.S. Department of State provides training, weapons, ammunition, night-vision goggles, and other equipment.
* Coastal and River Interdiction (2000–2008 cost: $89 million)
** This program gave the Colombian Navy and Marines water vessels and aircraft to patrol the country&#x27;s coast and rivers. The Navy received 8 interceptor boats and 2 Cessna Grand Caravan transport planes. The Marines received 95 patrol boats. The U.S. also provided both services with weapons, fuel, communications gear, night-vision goggles, and other equipment.
* Air Interdiction (2000–2008 cost: $62 million)
** The U.S. State and Defense departments provided the Colombian Air Force with 7 surveillance planes and their maintenance support. The program also operates five radars inside Colombia, other radars outside the country, and airborne radars. The program is also known as the Air Bridge Denial Program.
* Another $2 billion were allocated from 2000 to 2008 to other programs including the Critical Flight Safety Program to extend the life of the U.S. State Department&#x27;s fleet of aircraft, additional counternarcotics funding and aviation support for battlefield medical evacuations.

==Nonmilitary programs==

As of 2008, the U.S. has provided nearly $1.3 billion to Colombia through Plan Colombia&#x27;s nonmilitary aid programs:
* Alternative Development (2000–2008 cost: $500 million)
* Internally Displaced Persons (2000–2008 cost: $247 million)
* Demobilization and Reintegration (2000–2008 cost: $44 million)
* Democracy and Human Rights (2000–2008 cost: $158 million)
* Promote the Rule of Law (2000–2008 cost: $238 million)

==Results==
===U.S. 2005 estimate===
On April 14, 2006, the U.S. Drug Czar&#x27;s office announced that its Colombian coca cultivation estimate for 2005 was significantly greater than that of any year since 2002. The press release from the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy stated that &quot;coca cultivation declined by 8 percent, from 114,100 to 105,400 hectares, when those areas surveyed by the US government in 2004 were compared with the same areas in 2005&quot;. However, &quot;the survey also found 144,000 hectares of coca under cultivation in 2005 in a search area that was 81 percent larger than that used in 2004...newly imaged areas show about 39,000 additional hectares of coca. Because these areas were not previously surveyed, it is impossible to determine for how long they have been under coca cultivation.&quot;

Critics of Plan Colombia and of ongoing fumigation programs considered this new information as a sign of the failure of current U.S. drug policy. The Center for International Policy stated that &quot;even if we accept the U.S. government&#x27;s argument that the high 2005 estimate owes to measurement in new areas, it is impossible to claim that Plan Colombia has brought a 50 percent reduction in coca-growing in six years...Either Colombia has returned to [the 2002] level of cultivation, or the &#x27;reductions&#x27; reported in 2002 and 2003 were false due to poor measurement.&quot;

===UN 2005 estimate===
On June 20, 2006, the United Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) presented its own survey on Andean coca cultivation, reporting a smaller increase of about 8% and confirming a rising trend shown by the earlier U.S. findings. UN surveys employ a different methodology and are part of the ongoing &quot;Illicit Crop Monitoring Program&quot; (ICMP) and its &quot;Integrated Illicit Crop Monitoring System&quot; (SIMCI) project. The UNODC press release stated that during 2005 the &quot;area under coca cultivation in Colombia rose by 6,000 hectares to 86,000 after four consecutive years of decline despite the continued efforts of the Government to eradicate coca crops&quot;. This represents a small increase above the lowest figure recorded by UNODC&#x27;s surveys, which was 80,000 hectares in 2004. For UNODC, current cultivation remained &quot;still well below the peak of 163,300 hectares recorded in 2000&quot;, as &quot;significant reductions [...] have been made in the past five years and overall figures remain nearly a third below their peak of 2000&quot;.

UNODC concluded that &quot;substantial international assistance&quot; is needed by Colombia and the other Andean countries &quot;so they can provide poor coca farmers with sustainable alternative livelihoods&quot; and that &quot;aid efforts need to be multiplied at least tenfold in order to reach all impoverished farmers who need support&quot;.

===Analysis===
The results of Plan Colombia have been mixed. From the perspective of the U.S. and Colombian governments, the results of Plan Colombia have been positive. U.S. government statistics show that a significant reduction in leftover coca (total cultivation minus eradicated coca) has been observed from peak 2001 levels of 1,698 square kilometers to an estimated 1,140 square kilometers in 2004. It is said that a record high aerial herbicide fumigation campaign of 1,366 square kilometers in 2004 has reduced the total area of surviving coca, even as newer areas are planted.
Despite this, effective reductions may appear to have reached their limits as in 2004, despite a record high aerial herbicide fumigation campaign of 1,366 square kilometers, the total area of surviving coca has remained constant, as an estimated 1,139 square kilometers in 2003 were followed by about 1,140 square kilometers in 2004.

Additionally, recent poppy seed cultivation has decreased while coca cultivation actually has not. Overall attempted coca cultivation by growers (total planted coca without taking eradication into account) increased somewhat, from 2,467 square kilometers in 2003 to 2,506 square kilometers in 2004. Coca cultivation reached its highest point during the program in 2002 at 2,671 square kilometers.

The U.S. and Colombian governments interpret this data to show a decline in potential production of cocaine, from a peak of 700 metric tons in 2001 to 460 in 2003 and 430 in 2004, as result of an increase in &quot;newly planted [coca fields] in response to eradication,&quot; which should be less productive than mature coca.

U.S. government officials admitted in late 2005 that the market price of cocaine has yet to rise significantly, as would be expected from the above reductions in supply. They pointed to possible hidden stashes and other methods of circumventing the immediate effect of eradication efforts which allow for a relatively constant flow of drugs able to enter into the market, delaying the consequences of drug eradication. U.S. Drug Czar John Walters stated that &quot;the reason for [reductions in supply not immediately driving prices up] is that you are not seizing and consuming coca leaves that were grown in 2004 in 2004. You are seizing and consuming coca leaves that were probably grown and processed in 2003 and 2002.&quot;

Other observers say this points to the ultimate ineffectiveness of the Plan in stopping the flow of drugs and addressing more important or underlying issues like providing a viable alternative for landless and other peasants, who turn to coca cultivation due to a lack of other economic possibilities, in addition to having to deal with the tumultuous civil conflict between the state, guerrillas and paramilitaries. They also say that by making coca difficult to grow and transport in one area will lead to the movement of the drug cultivation processes to other areas, both inside and outside Colombia, a consequence also known as the balloon effect.

As an example of the above, it is claimed by critics that Peru and Bolivia, as countries which had earlier monopolized coca cultivations until local eradication efforts later led to the eventual transfer of that part of the illegal business to Colombia, have recently had small increases in coca production despite record eradication in Colombia, which some years ago accounted for about 80% of the coca base produced in South America. Supporters of the Plan and of drug prohibition in general consider that the increase has, so far, been significant to be a sign of the above &quot;balloon effect&quot;.

The Colombian government announced that it eradicated around 73,000 coca hectares during 2006 which, according to it, would be above all local records in coca plant destruction. The Colombian government said that it plans to destroy an additional 50,000 hectares of coca in 2007.

&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; hailed Colombia as &quot;the most successful nation-building exercise by the United States in this century&quot;, noting:

Colombia used to be the world capital of kidnappings, but the number of victims is down from 2,882 in 2002 to 376 in 2008. Terrorist acts in the same period have fallen from 1,645 to 303. Homicides are also down dramatically: from 28,837 in 2002 to 13,632 in 2008, a 52 percent reduction. Three hundred fifty-nine Colombian soldiers and police lost their lives in battle in 2008, down from 684 in 2002. Between 2002 and 2008, the total hectares of cocaine eradicated rose from 133,127 to 229,227; tons of cocaine seized rose from 105.1 to 245.5; and the number of drug labs seized rose from 1,448 to 3,667. All statistics on narcotics production are hard to gather and therefore suspect, but the latest indications are that last year cocaine production in Colombia fell by 40 percent. Although Colombia&#x27;s GDP grew by only 2.4 percent in 2008 as a result of the worldwide slowdown, it grew almost 8 percent in 2007, up from less than 2 percent in 2002. Unemployment is still high at 11.1 percent, but considerably lower than in 2002 when it was 15.7 percent.

<text>In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a function among a that closely matches (&quot;approximates&quot;) a in a task-specific way. The need for function approximations arises in many branches of applied mathematics, and computer science in particular , such as predicting the growth of microbes in microbiology. Function approximations are used where theoretical models are unavailable or hard to compute.

One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: 

First, for known target functions approximation theory is the branch of numerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for example, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).

Second, the target function, call it &quot;g&quot;, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points of the form (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain of &quot;g&quot;, several techniques for approximating &quot;g&quot; may be applicable. For example, if &quot;g&quot; is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of interpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can be used. If the codomain (range or target set) of &quot;g&quot; is a finite set, one is dealing with a classification problem instead.

To some extent, the different problems (regression, classification, fitness approximation) have received a unified treatment in statistical learning theory, where they are viewed as supervised learning problems.

<text>Josiah Edward &quot;Jed&quot; Bartlet is a fictional character from the American television serial drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; created by Aaron Sorkin and portrayed by actor Martin Sheen. The role earned Sheen a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2001, as well as two SAG Awards.

Bartlet&#x27;s tenure as a fictional Democratic President of the United States is a preeminent aspect of the series. His origin as a recurring character evolved due to Sheen&#x27;s acting finesse; Sorkin and fellow &quot;West Wing&quot; writers shaped Bartlet&#x27;s role within the show accordingly. The first season depicts part of Bartlet&#x27;s first two years in the White House. The remainder of the series fleshes out the details of Bartlet&#x27;s administration, including friction between his policies and those of the Republican-dominated Congress, his tribulations with multiple sclerosis, his reelection, and the campaign of his successor, Matt Santos. Bartlet is characterized by manifest integrity, quick witticisms, a fierce intellect, and compassionate stoicism.

==Creation and development==
Show creator Aaron Sorkin had not initially intended to feature the president at all. He envisioned the series as focused on the White House senior staff who execute and advise on major policy and political matters. &quot;Then I felt that would become ,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ll constantly be just missing the president. As he walks around the corner, we&#x27;ll see the back of his head.&quot; The character of Josiah Bartlet was then created as a recurring figure, and Martin Sheen was signed to appear in four episodes. Alan Alda (who went on to portray Senator Arnold Vinick), Jason Robards, and Sidney Poitier were also considered for the role. After seeing Sheen&#x27;s dailies, the producers were so impressed that they asked him to join the regular cast. &quot;They realized that people might catch on that I&#x27;d be there only once a month, so they talked to me about a longer commitment,&quot; says Sheen. The actor said that part of the reason he took on the role of Bartlet was because of his involvement in social issues.

Sorkin&#x27;s main interest in writing for the character was exploring the side of the president that the public does not generally see. Sheen described the character as being drawn largely from Bill Clinton: &quot;He&#x27;s bright, astute, and filled with all the negative foibles that make him very human,&quot; he told &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Sheen said elsewhere that he adored Clinton and was welcomed into the Clinton White House for visits during the period between the show&#x27;s beginning in the fall of 1999 and the inauguration of George W. Bush as president in January 2001. Sorkin said he took some of Bartlet&#x27;s characteristics from his own father, namely his &quot;great love of education and literature [and] all things old,&quot; his &quot;[belief] in a genuine goodness in people,&quot; and his &quot;&#x27;Aw, Dad&#x27; sense of humor.&quot;

In the middle of the show&#x27;s first season, it is revealed that Bartlet has multiple sclerosis. According to Sorkin, this was not planned; the plot came about because he wanted to write an episode in which the president was in bed watching a soap opera and the audience discovered that the first lady was a physician. &quot;When I wrote the pilot, I didn&#x27;t have any idea what was going to happen in Episode 2, much less 12,&quot; he says.

==Character biography==

===Personal life===
Bartlet was born in 1942 and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire. He is a descendant of Dr Josiah Bartlett, a real-world signatory of the Declaration of Independence.

Bartlet is a devout Roman Catholic. This is due to the influence of his mother, as his father would have preferred that he be raised Protestant. His relationship with his father was often strained from parental abuse. In a discussion with his subconscious, personified by the &quot;ghost&quot; of Mrs Landingham, his father is described as &quot;a prick who could never get over the fact that he wasn&#x27;t as smart as his brothers&quot;. Sorkin has stated that Bartlet&#x27;s father, &quot;obviously convinced he married some Catholic whore, treats his son terribly for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that he adopted his mother&#x27;s religion.&quot; Sorkin said that Bartlet&#x27;s tirade against God in the episode &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot; is therefore directed just as much at Bartlet&#x27;s own father as it is at God. However, when his father&#x27;s unkind and sometimes abusive treatment of him is mentioned by Toby Ziegler, Bartlet attempts to defend his father. Though he is long dead, Toby suggests that Bartlet is still trying to get the man to like him, hoping that &quot;maybe if you get enough votes, win one more election,&quot; Bartlet will finally be able to earn his father&#x27;s approval.

He displays a remarkable ability for chess. Once, he engaged several members of his staff in separate matches at the same time and won.

Bartlet scored 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT college admission test. Later he retook the exam, and received the same result, something both Leo McGarry and Dr Stanley Keyworth find amusing. He was accepted to Williams, Harvard, and Yale, but instead chose to go to the University of Notre Dame, as he was considering becoming a priest, though decided against it after meeting Abbey, his future wife. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in American studies and a minor in theology. He received a Masters and Ph.D. in economics from the London School of Economics, as well as an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Dartmouth College, where he was a tenured professor prior to entering politics. He speaks four languages, including Latin, English, and German. He is a Nobel Laureate in Economics, and is generally portrayed as a macroeconomist sympathetic to Keynesian views. He was required to split his Nobel Prize with another economist, a much more conservative Japanese man whom Bartlet respects but does not particularly like. He is the author of a book entitled &quot;Theory and Practice of Macroeconomics in Developing Countries&quot;, and his research in economics is described as being focused on the developing world.

Bartlet&#x27;s wife, Abigail Bartlet, is a thoracic surgeon and they have three daughters: Elizabeth Anne Westin, Eleanor Emily Bartlet, and Zoey Patricia Bartlet. There are two grandchildren from his oldest daughter, Elizabeth: Annie, who is 12 in the pilot (although she is shown as and is referenced as being much younger in later episodes), and Gus, who is about 5 in the fifth season. It is also revealed in the seventh season that middle daughter Ellie is pregnant with Bartlet&#x27;s third grandchild. He is depicted as a stern but very loving and indulgent father, in contrast to his own father, who (as is seen in flashbacks) was cold and physically abusive. President Bartlet also has paternal feelings towards members of his staff, referring to Charlie Young (his personal aide, with whom he is especially close, denoted by the gift of the Bartlet family carving knife made by Paul Revere) and Josh Lyman (his deputy chief of staff) as his sons, and telling C.J. Cregg (his press secretary and later chief of staff) that she is part of his family.

Bartlet suffers from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, which at one time puts the future of his presidency in doubt. He and his wife concealed his illness during his initial presidential run and would not disclose the information until well into his first term, leading to allegations of fraud. He receives a Congressional censure for covering up his MS while running for president.

Bartlet began his political career when he was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He later served three terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district. Like his ancestor, Jed Bartlet served as Governor of New Hampshire, and he won re-election to his final term with 69% of the vote.

A recurring motif throughout the series is Bartlet&#x27;s inability to remember the names of junior staffers, a trait taken directly from Sheen&#x27;s own memory tendencies. However, in the series finale episode, he meets and thanks a long series of White House staff members and addresses them all accurately by name.
Bartlet also displays an obsession with trivia, often quizzing family, friends, and staff, whether they are interested or not — generally not.

===Presidency===
Bartlet&#x27;s best friend, Leo McGarry, persuades him to run for president around the fall of 1997, writing the slogan &quot;Bartlet for America&quot; on a cocktail napkin. Although initially a dark horse, Bartlet eventually defeats the Democratic frontrunner, U.S. Senator John Hoynes of Texas, whom Bartlet asks to join the ticket as his vice-presidential running mate. He defeats the Republican nominee for president, winning a close election with just 48 per cent of the vote, 48 million popular votes, and a 303–235 margin in the Electoral College. He is sworn into his first term on January 20, 1999.

Bartlet&#x27;s accomplishments as president include appointing the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice and first female Chief Justice, negotiating a peace settlement between Israel and Palestine, creating millions of new jobs, providing strong support for alternative energy, and orchestrating a Social Security reform plan (although it is never made clear whether the plan is passed by the United States Congress, the show indicates that a revolutionary agreement is achieved with bi-partisan support). He does, however, express regret at his inability to balance the budget in his eight years in the White House.

Bartlet does not shy away from using the military when he feels it is necessary during his eight years in the White House, and deals with major foreign policy crises in various parts of the world. The Middle East is a recurring source of problems, particularly Iran, Syria, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the fictional gulf state of Qumar. Bartlet is able to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by negotiating a historic agreement at Camp David in 2005 and deploying peacekeepers to the region, despite opposition to these efforts from both Democrats and Republicans. Terrorism, particularly from the Bahji network based in Qumar, is a continual problem and in the season 4 finale, Bartlet has to confront the kidnapping of his own daughter at the hands of the group. In Latin America, Bartlet has to deal with situations in Haiti, Colombia and Bolivia. A conflict and genocide in the fictional African nation of Equatorial Kundu lead Bartlet to intervene militarily and declare a bold interventionist foreign policy doctrine. In Asia, Bartlet deals with tensions and near-conflicts between India and Pakistan, China and Taiwan, and Russia and China. The latter crisis, in his final year, leads to him deploying 140,000 peacekeepers to prevent a full-blown conflict over oil in Kazakhstan, and this becomes a key issue in the 2006 presidential campaign to succeed him.

President Bartlet shows the most affection among his staffers to Josh Lyman, C.J. Cregg, and Sam Seaborn. He predicts that Sam will one day run for president and expresses his faith in Sam&#x27;s capability. While he clearly respects Toby Ziegler, the two are prone to clash, usually when Toby feels the President is not acting according to his true morality or is ducking important issues. He is pained when he finds out Toby has leaked classified national security information and fires him. Bartlet eventually signs a pardon for Toby in his last official act as president. He does not get along well with either of his vice presidents, John Hoynes or Bob Russell, saying at one point he does not know what either of them is good for. For reasons presumably tied to his own lack of military service, he is somewhat intimidated by acid-tongued Secretary of Defense Miles Hutchinson and deferential to respected Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Percy Fitzwallace.

Bartlet is shot in the first season cliffhanger finale &quot;What Kind of Day Has It Been&quot;. While it is revealed in the season 2 opening episode that his wounds are not serious (quick medical intervention having him on his feet within a few hours), Josh Lyman is critically injured. It is eventually discovered that the shooters were white supremacists from West Virginia and that his bodyman Charlie Young was the intended target of the assassination attempt, not Bartlet himself.

In the second-season finale, &quot;Two Cathedrals,&quot; Bartlet announces to the country that he suffers from multiple sclerosis, and has been keeping it a secret, although this had previously been revealed to the show&#x27;s audience in the first-season episode &quot;He Shall, from Time to Time...&quot; This leads to an investigation of Bartlet&#x27;s administration by a special prosecutor and by the United States House of Representatives, a storyline which dominates much of the show&#x27;s third season. Eventually, Bartlet accepts a censure from Congress, which settles all investigations against him. While Bartlet&#x27;s campaign efforts are damaged by the controversy, he nonetheless defeats the Republican nominee, Governor Robert Ritchie of Florida, by a landslide and is returned for a second term. The election is forecast to be close until Bartlet scores a decisive debate win over Ritchie.

Zoey Bartlet is kidnapped on the day of her graduation from Georgetown University, possibly in retaliation for the assassination of the Qumari defence minister, Abdul ibn Shareef, which her father authorized. While Zoey is missing, President Bartlet fears he is incapable of maintaining the necessary dispassion while his daughter is in such danger and invokes Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, declaring himself incapacitated and transferring the powers of the presidency to the next person in the presidential line of succession. Due to the resignation a few days earlier of Vice President Hoynes, the Speaker of the House, Republican Glen Allen Walken, becomes Acting President of the United States. Zoey recovers with only minor injuries several days later and President Bartlet reassumes his office shortly thereafter.

Soon after Bartlet resumes the presidency, he faces off against Jeff Haffley, the newly elected Speaker of the House (replacing Walken, who was forced to resign in order to fulfil his duties as acting president) on intense budget negotiations that break down to the point where the federal government is shut down (similar to the real world 1995 and 1996 shutdowns during the Clinton administration). Eventually, Bartlet topples Haffley&#x27;s influence and sees to it that the Speaker&#x27;s power declines thereafter.

At the end of the fifth season and the beginning of the sixth, the Bartlet administration is dragged into the Israeli-Arab dispute after terrorists attack U.S. government officials on a trip to Gaza. Eventually, after intense negotiations at Camp David between the Israelis and the Palestinians, Bartlet manages to secure a peace agreement but at a great cost, firing his chief of staff Leo McGarry in a disagreement over the conflict. McGarry has a heart attack but later returns to work as Special Counsellor to the President. CJ Cregg succeeds him as chief of staff.

On a trip to China, Bartlet is left temporarily paralyzed by an attack of multiple sclerosis. As a result, he briefly uses a wheelchair but soon recovers although he is left somewhat weakened by the attack. After seeing Congressman Matt Santos&#x27; stirring speech at the Democratic National Convention, Bartlet has a chat with a New York Democratic leader who had previously refused to support Santos due to concerns over education policy; the leader reverses his course and Santos becomes the Democratic nominee for president.

In the seventh and final season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Bartlet is in the last year of his term as president. Near the end of the season, Congressman Matt Santos of Texas defeats the Republican nominee, Senator Arnold Vinick of California, in the 2006 presidential election and thereby becomes Bartlet&#x27;s successor. After Santos&#x27; inauguration, Bartlet returns to his New Hampshire home aboard Air Force One with his wife and while en route has the last word of the series. Mrs Bartlet asks the introspective former president what he is thinking about, and Bartlet replies: &quot;Tomorrow.&quot;

The Bartlet Presidential Library opens three years after the end of his term and Bartlet is present at the opening ceremony, along with Kate Harper, C. J. Cregg, Danny Concannon, Charlie Young, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, and Will Bailey. The new president does not appear, as this scene occurs in a flash forward during season seven, before the election.

West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin briefly revived the character for Maureen Dowd&#x27;s September 20, 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; column, where he scripted a hypothetical meeting between Bartlet and then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. He did the same after Obama&#x27;s first debate against Mitt Romney in 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;The West Wing&quot;″s portrayal of multiple sclerosis through Bartlet was applauded by Mike Dugan, president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Dugan stated that the group was especially pleased that the affected character was a world leader, that the show educated viewers about MS and made it clear the disease is not fatal, and that Bartlet was shown as taking advantage of medical breakthroughs to treat his condition. &quot;Since fiction often becomes more real to people than fact, President Bartlet&#x27;s life with MS has the potential for great good,&quot; he said, suggesting that as Bartlet was able to overcome the challenges of his disease to succeed, &quot;the public will become more accepting of individuals with MS and individuals with MS will become more accepting of themselves and their abilities to lead fulfilling lives.&quot;

Mike McCurry, a former press secretary for the Clinton administration, described Bartlet as the ideal president, possessing &quot;the compassion and integrity of Jimmy Carter... that shrewd decision-making and hard-nosed realism of a Richard Nixon... the warmth and amiability and the throw-the-arm-around-the-shoulder of a Bill Clinton; and... the liberal passion of a Teddy Kennedy.&quot; James Poniewozik described the character in 2002 as &quot;a folksy Nobel laureate with touches of F.D.R., Stephen Hawking, Will Rogers and the Buddha.&quot;

At one point, the producers of &quot;The X-Files&quot; considered having Sheen portray Bartlet in the final episode of the show, in a scene where he would be informed by members of The Syndicate that Fox Mulder escaped from government custody. Instead, Bartlet was replaced by an actor playing George W. Bush, although the scene was cut from the final episode altogether.

A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; poll in 2016 named Martin Sheen&#x27;s Josiah Bartlet as the second greatest fictional president, behind Harrison Ford&#x27;s President James Marshall in &quot;Air Force One&quot;.

<text>William Garrett Walden, known as W. G. Snuffy Walden (born February 13, 1950), is an American musician and composer of film and television soundtracks. Walden is an Emmy Award winner for the theme music to &quot;The West Wing&quot; (NBC), has been nominated for numerous other Emmys throughout his career, and has received 26 BMI Awards.

== Early life ==
Walden was born in Louisiana on February 13, 1950, and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Clear Creek High School in League City, Texas in 1967. In college he studied science and math, and he put himself through school working on a late-night radio show at KRBE in Houston and playing guitar in a strip club.

Walden&#x27;s middle name was his mother&#x27;s maiden name, and this was the origin of his nickname. Members of his mother&#x27;s family had sometimes been called Snuffy after the Southern snuff manufacturer Levi Garrett. His family and schoolmates addressed him as Garrett, but Snuffy began to stick when he was away at summer camp and the name was preferred by fellow musicians as his career began.

== Career ==
In the late 1960s, Walden dropped out of school, quit his job, and devoted his energies to the guitar full-time, picking up a bass player (Al Roberts) and drummer (Randy Reeder) to form a three-piece band named Aphrodite. They started touring and wound up in Denver, playing local clubs and opening for acts like Buddy Miles. It was in Denver that Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s road manager, Neville Chesters, saw them in a club and offered them a recording contract with ELP&#x27;s label, Manticore. In 1972, the group moved to England and was reformed, keeping Al Roberts and changing the name to Stray Dog. There, they were signed to Manticore and Greg Lake produced three songs from their first album &quot;Stray Dog&quot;. The new group toured with ELP as the opening act, but never really took flight, and eventually folded. Following the breakup of the band, Walden supplanted the ailing Paul Kossoff by providing guitar tracks for Free&#x27;s final album &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, which was released in 1973 (Walden plays on &#x27;Common Mortal Man&#x27;, &#x27;Easy on My Soul&#x27; and &#x27;Seven Angels&#x27;). He also played electric guitar in 1973, on the debut solo album &quot;Still&quot; by King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield. In 1975, he joined The Eric Burdon Band and performed with them for a year.

In 1975, Walden moved to Los Angeles and spent the rest of the decade performing as a solo artist and supporting artists such as Stevie Wonder, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, and Eric Burdon. Notably, in 1975-6 he again filled in for Paul Kossoff as a session musician on Back Street Crawler&#x27;s &quot;Second Street&quot; album. By the mid-1980s, television agents and producers became aware of Walden through his local performances in Santa Monica. When approached to score a new television show, Walden had mixed feelings but accepted the offer.
&quot;I could see the handwriting on the wall for touring,&quot; he would later remember, &quot;and it wasn&#x27;t pretty. I kept envisioning Holiday Inn at age 60.&quot; The television show he was hired for was &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, which turned out to be a major hit television series and dramatically altered Walden&#x27;s music career.

Following his success as a touring and session musician and an Emmy nomination for the &quot;Theme from Thirtysomething&quot;, Walden scored numerous television series, including &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Early Edition&quot;, &quot;Sports Night&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Huff&quot;, &quot;Once and Again&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;.

In the summer of 2001, Walden released a solo album of mainly acoustic guitar pieces titled &quot;Music by... W. G. Snuffy Walden&quot;. The album included expanded or full versions of many of Walden&#x27;s themes, such as &quot;Once and Again&quot;, &quot;Eugene&#x27;s Ragtop&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething (Revisited)&quot;, and &quot;West Wing Suite&quot;.

In July 2002, Tom Guerra conducted a comprehensive interview of Walden for &quot;Vintage Guitar Magazine&quot;. In April 2008, Stephen J. Abramson interviewed Walden for a four-hour, multi-part video series for the Television Academy.

In March 2018, &quot;Up to Snuff&quot;, a documentary film about Walden&#x27;s career, won the documentary competition in its premier at the Pasadena International Film Festival.

In September 2018, Walden starred in a 1950s style cover of &quot;Africa&quot; by Toto along with the musical collective Postmodern Jukebox on YouTube.

<text>The town of Haslemere () and the villages of Shottermill and Grayswood are in south west Surrey, England, around south west of London. Together with the settlements of Hindhead and Beacon Hill, they comprise the civil parish of Haslemere in the Borough of Waverley. The tripoint between the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and West Sussex is at the west end of Shottermill.

Much of the civil parish is in the catchment area of the south branch of the River Wey, which rises on Blackdown in West Sussex. The urban areas of Haslemere and Shottermill are concentrated along the valleys of the young river and its tributaries, and many of the local roads are narrow and steep. The National Trust is a major landowner in the civil parish and its properties include Swan Barn Farm. The Surrey Hills National Landscape is to the north of the town and the South Downs National Park is to the south.

Haslemere is thought to have originated as a planned town in the 12th century and was awarded a market charter in 1221. By the early 16th century, it had become a Parliamentary borough and was represented by two MPs in the House of Commons until 1832. The town began to grow in the second half of the 19th century, following the opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line in 1859. In late-Victorian times, it became a centre for the Arts and Crafts movement and the International Dolmetsch Early Music Festival was founded in 1925. Haslemere became an Urban District in 1913, but under the Local Government Act 1972, its status was reduced to a civil parish with a town council.

Shottermill grew up as a hamlet near to one of the watermills on the River Wey in the 16th century. The settlement began to expand in the 1880s and joined the Haslemere Urban District in 1933. Until the end of the 19th century, Grayswood was a small farming community, but became an ecclesiastical parish in 1901.

==Toponymy==
The first indication of a settlement at Haslemere is from 1180, when there is a record of a &quot;Chapel of Piperham&quot;, belonging to the church at Chiddingfold. The town is recorded as &quot;Heselmere&quot; in 1221 and 1255, &quot;Haselmere&quot; in 1255 and 1441, &quot;Hasulmere&quot; in 1310, &quot;Hesselmere&quot; in 1612 and &quot;Hasselmere&quot; in 1654. The &quot;mere&quot; element of the name is thought to refer to a lake or pond on the west side of the High Street, which was visible until at least 1859. The &quot;hasle&quot; element of the name may refer to the common hazel tree or to the Heysulle family from Chiddingfold, who are known to have owned land in the area until the 14th century.

Grayswood appears as &quot;Grasewode&quot; in 1479 and 1518, &quot;Grasewood&quot; in 1537 and 1577, &quot;Grace Wood&quot; in 1568 and &quot;Greyes Wood&quot; in 1583. The &quot;gray&quot; element may derive from the Old French personal name &quot;Gerard&quot; and there may be an association with &quot;Gerardswoded&quot;, recorded in the 14th and 15th centuries near Witley, also in south west Surrey.

Shottermill is first recorded as &quot;Shottover&quot; in 1537 and &quot;Schoutouermyll&quot; in 1607. The modern spelling is first used in 1583 and references a watermill owned by the Shotter family.

==Geography==
===Haslemere Civil Parish===
The civil parish of Haslemere is in the borough of Waverley in south west Surrey, close to the borders with both Hampshire and West Sussex. The parish includes the villages of Hindhead, Beacon Hill and Grayswood, the settlements of Shottermill and Critchmere, as well as the town of Haslemere. The area is served by two principal transport routes, the London to Portsmouth railway line and the A3 trunk road, both of which run via Guildford.

Much of the civil parish is in the catchment area of the south branch of the River Wey, which rises on the northern slopes of Blackdown, to the south of Haslemere town. The area to the east of the town is drained by the River Arun. Around 48% of the civil parish is covered by woodland, of which is classified as Ancient Woodland. Approximately 17% of the parish, , is protected and includes parts of two Special Protection Areas, one Special Area of Conservation and four Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The main settlements are surrounded by the Surrey Hills National Landscape.

===Haslemere town, Shottermill and Grayswood===
Haslemere town is in the south east of the civil parish. The commercial centre is at the junction of the High Street, Petworth Road and Lower Street, which together form an inverted &quot;T&quot; shape. Shottermill, to the west, is on the north side of the valley of the south branch of the River Wey and is linked to Haslemere via Wey Hill. The hamlet of Critchmere is to the north west of Shottermill and the village of Grayswood is to the north of Haslemere town.

===Geology===
The oldest outcrops in the civil parish are of Weald Clay, which comes to the surface to the east of Grayswood, where the young tributaries of the River Arun have eroded the overlying strata. A Weald Clay sandstone is also exposed in the same area. The Atherfield Clay lies above the Weald Clay and is exposed as an outcrop north of Grayswood and also in the railway cutting, west of the station. The majority of Haslemere and Shottermill lie on the Hythe Beds of the Lower Greensand and the spring line, where the tributaries of the Wey and Arun rise, is on the junction between this permeable layer and the impermeable Atherfield Clay below. The gravel found in the river valleys is thought to have been deposited during the penultimate ice age and is composed of rock fragments of local origin. Much of the soil in the civil parish is free-draining, very acidic, sandy, loamy and of low fertility. To the east of Haslemere town and Graywsood, the soil is loamy and clayey, and is of low permeability.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence for human activity in the Haslemere area is from the Neolithic. Flints dating from 4000 to 2400 BCE were discovered during archaeological surveys conducted prior to the construction of the Hindhead Tunnel. There may have been a settlement in the area in the mid-late Bronze Age and a Romano-British cemetery was discovered on the site of Beech Road, to the north of the town centre, at the start of the 20th century.

===Governance===

Neither Shottermill nor Haslemere are directly mentioned in Domesday Book, but the land on which the two settlements are now located was divided between the Farnham and Godalming Hundreds respectively. The south western corner of Surrey is thought to have been sparsely populated in the 11th century, but it is possible that some of the mills listed under the entry for Farnham, were located on the Wey in the Shottermill area.

The first indication of a settlement at Haslemere is from 1180, when there is a record of a &quot;Chapel of Piperham&quot;. The chapel belonged to the Parish of Chiddingfold, part of the manor of Godalming and is thought to have been either on or close to the site of the current St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church. There may also have been a settlement on Haste Hill, to the south east of the town centre, and there are references to &quot;Churchliten field&quot; and the &quot;Old church-yard&quot; in records of the area.

The first use of the modern name Haslemere is from 1221, when permission for a market was given to Richard Poore, Bishop of Salisbury, indicating that the settlement was sufficiently large to be considered a town. In 1397, Richard II granted a charter to the settlement, confirming the order from 1221 and permitting an annual fair to be held in the town. The town remained in the possession of the Bishops of Salisbury until , when it was purchased by the Crown.
The first indication of a settlement at Shottermill is from 1285, when reference is made to a Manor of Pitfold, covering the extreme southern portion of Farnham Hundred. From 1344, the manor was held by Edward III, but was granted to the Convent of Dartford in 1362. The land remained in the convent&#x27;s possession until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, when it reverted to the Crown. A new charter was issued to Haslemere town by Elizabeth I in 1596. Today, this special status is celebrated with the Charter fair, held once every two years in the High Street.

Reforms during the Tudor period replaced the day-to-day administration of towns such as Haslemere in the hands of the vestry of the parish church. The vestry was charged with appointing a parish constable, running a lock-up, maintaining local roads and administering poor relief. In 1839, many administrative responsibilities were transferred to the Hambledon Rural District Council and in 1863, the civil parish of Haslemere was created, although local elections did not take place until the following year. In 1896, the &quot;Surrey Times&quot; praised the town&#x27;s authorities, writing: &quot;No parish council in the country has done better work than the Haslemere council. Sanitation, allotments, charities, lighting, roads, footpaths and waste lands have all been thoroughly and prudently looked after.&quot; A further change took place in 1913, when town was removed from the Hambledon Rural District and the Parish Council was promoted to the status of an Urban District Council (UDC). Initially the UDC was based at the Town Hall, but moved in 1926 to a building on Museum Hill, which had been vacated by the Haslemere Educational Museum.

Until 1896, Shottermill was part of the Frensham civil parish. It became independent in 1896, following the passing of the Local Government Act 1894. In 1900, the new council set up a District Sanitary Association to improve drainage and to install a sewerage system in the village. The Shottermill civil parish was disbanded in 1933, when the area became part of the Haslemere Urban District.

The most recent change in local government took place in 1974, when the urban districts of Farnham, Godalming and Haslemere were merged with Hambledon Rural District to form Waverley District. The Haslemere UDC was reduced to a town council and the reformed body readopted the town hall as its main meeting place.

===Parliamentary borough===
Haslemere may have become a parliamentary borough as early as 1230, when there is a record of the grant of a burgage plot in the settlement. It is referred to as a &quot;burgus&quot; in a document of 1377, but the first known MPs for the town were not elected until 1584. Elizabeth I confirmed the borough status in the charter of 1596. Until the Reform Act 1832, two MPs were elected to represent the town in the House of Commons. The electorate was confined to those holding property either as freeholders or as tenants of burgage properties, who paid rent to the lord of the manor. Electoral records show that for the elections of 1664 and 1735, there were only 82 and 85 eligible properties respectively. By the early 17th century, Haslemere had acquired a reputation as a pocket borough.

The More family, who owned Loseley Park, effectively controlled the borough for much of the 17th century. However, in 1722, More Molyneux and his favoured co-candidate, Montague Blundell, 1st Viscount Blundell, lost the election to James Oglethorpe and Peter Burrell. In 1754, James More Molyneux, son of More Molyneux, was determined to reclaim the seat for his family. He and his favoured co-candidate, Philip Carteret Webb, purchased 34 freeholds and tenements, and installed their own representative as Bailiff to oversee the election. The freehold of the Red Cow Inn was split into shares, to further increase the number likely to vote for More Molyneux and Webb, who were duly elected.

The final elections in Haslemere Borough took place in 1830 and two years later the constituency was combined with that of Farnham.

===Transport and communications===
Before the start of the 18th century, the local roads were the responsibility of the parishes through which they passed. The main road between London and Portsmouth ran over Gibbet Hill to the west of Hindhead, and stagecoaches are known to have travelled along this section from 1732. It became the responsibility of a turnpike trust in 1749 and was rerouted around the edge of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl in 1826, to reduce the gradient to a maximum of 5%. This road is now known as the A3 and was further improved in 2011, with the opening of the Hindhead Tunnel.

The road through Grayswood and Haslemere became a turnpike in 1764. A mail coach started running along this road, now the A286, in 1769. In the early 19th century, there were as many as 24 stagecoaches a day passing through the town, however the number reduced following the opening of the in 1841.

The railway line through Haslemere was authorised by parliament in July 1853 and was built by the civil engineer, Thomas Brassey. Construction work started in August 1853, but was not completed until May 1858, in part because of the magnitude of the excavation work required for the deep cutting through Haslemere. The line opened on 1 January 1859, with trains running as far as . Although the earthworks were built to accommodate two tracks, initially only a single line was installed. The line was doubled in 1876-77 and the station platforms at Haslemere were extended to allow express services to call from January 1894.
The Grade II-listed station signal box was constructed in 1894. It is built in red brick with a hipped Welsh Slate roof and is one of only two surviving examples of a platform-mounted LSWR Type 4 design. The semaphore signals in the station were replaced by colour lights in 1937, the same year that the line was electrified.

===Industry and commerce===
The market charter for Haslemere was granted in 1221 and a license to hold an annual fair followed in 1397. By the end of the Middle Ages, it would appear that the market was no longer being held regularly, necessitating the regrant of the charter by Elizabeth I in 1596. The market was held at the south end of the High Street, the widest part, and a market house was built at that location in 1626. The original building would have been constructed of wood, but it was replaced by a brick structure, the present Town Hall, in 1814.
By the end of the medieval period, there were at least five watermills on the River Wey and its tributaries near Haslemere. The oldest, at Pitfold, was most likely established in Saxon times and operated as a corn mill until the 1340s, when it appears to have become a fulling mill for wool. The original Shotter Mill, now in West Sussex, was founded in the 1640s and a hamlet grew up to the north, adopting its name. Until 1880, the area was dominated by the farms belonging to Pitfold Manor and the mills were mostly used for grinding corn. From the mid-18th century, some of the mill sites were converted for other purposes, including Sickle Mill, owned by the Simmons family, which was used for paper manufacturing from . Paper making took place at three sites around Shottermill until the mid-1850s.

Between the 16th and the 18th centuries, Shottermill was a centre for iron making. A mill at Pophole (located at the modern-day tripoint between Surrey, West Sussex and Hampshire) harnessed water power to drive bellows for smelting and had a hammer for making iron bars. Production was well established by 1574 and it is probable that the mill supplied iron for the manufacture of cannons for the Navy. Much of the history of Pophole Mill is unclear, but it appears that activity at the site ceased shortly after 1732.

The civil parish was also a centre for textiles manufacture. Until , around 200 local inhabitants were engaged in silk weaving, which was carried out as a cottage industry. There was also a crape factory in Church Lane. In 1835, the Appleton family installed machinery for spinning and weaving at Pitfold Mill and began to make worsted lace and epaulettes for military uniforms. By 1851, Thomas Appleton was employing 100 workers and in 1854 he expanded his business with the purchase of Sickle Mill. The company moved to London in the 1880s.
The Peasant Arts Society was founded in Haslemere in the 1890s, when the weaver Maude King and her sister, the tapestry maker Ethel Blount, moved to the area. It was one of a number of organisations associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, that were founded in rural England at around the same time. Members, all drawn from the local working class, produced fabrics, rugs and tapestries, which were sold at exhibitions around the country. Ethel Blount and her husband Godfrey set up the Tapestry House in Foundry Meadow for the manufacture of appliqué needlework and embroidered items in 1896. Six years later, they also established the John Ruskin School and the St Cross School of Handicraft. The Peasant Arts Society closed in 1933, following the deaths of several of the founder members.

===Residential development===
The earliest surviving map of Haslemere, dating from 1735, shows that the High Street was fronted by a number of large houses. A few buildings survive from this period, including Town House and the Georgian House Hotel, as well as Tudor House, Fern Cottage and 10 High Street, which date from the previous century. There are several houses on Petworth Road, to the east of the town centre, which date from the 16th and 17th centuries.

Comparison of the 1735 map and the tithe map of 1842, indicates that there had been little change in the size of the settlement during the intervening hundred years, although a few properties had been built in the Wey Hill area. Houses constructed in the early 19th century include Broad Dene Grayswood House and Pound Corner House. Inclosure acts affecting the Haslemere area were passed in 1856, shortly before the opening of the railway line. The town began to appeal to new wealthy residents, who moved to the area from London, and also to tourists visiting the surrounding countryside. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, houses began to spread along Lower Street towards Shottermill.

Little development took place in Shottermill before 1880. The census returns indicate that there was a doubling of the population between 1881 and 1891, stimulated in part by the break-up of the Pitfold Manor estate in 1880. Several new houses for the gentry were built in the following decade, during which land to the north west of the village was donated to the National Trust. Housing for labourers and artisans was constructed along Lion Lane between 1880 and 1901, and dwellings began to spread towards Critchmere Hill in the first decade of the 20th century. The first houses in Critchmere Lane date from 1921 and were constructed by the Farnham Rural District Council. Many of the houses in the area were built using local bricks and there were brickworks on Wey Hill (formerly Clay Hill) and on Border Road until the early 20th century. Development of the west of Shottermill continued in the 1930s, with the creation of Pitfold and Sunvale Avenues.

Beech Road, to the north of Haslemere town centre, and Chestnut Avenue, to the west, were laid out in the early 1900s. Houses were also built in Grayswood at around the same time. Between 1900 and 1940, the Haslemere Tenants Society built 91 houses in the Fieldway, Bridge Road and Lion Mead area, which were subsequently acquired by the Haslemere UDC. In 1950, the council began to construct a new estate of 88 houses in Shottermill, close to the Sickle Mill, and purchased 100 pre-fabricated houses which had been erected by the Admiralty on Woolmer Hill during the Second World War. In 1953, the UDC bought of land to the north of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church for the Chatsworth Avenue and Weycombe Road estates. Although many large, detached houses on Bunch and Farnham Lanes, to the north of Shottermill, had been built in the Edwardian period, infilling took place in this area in the second half of the 20th century. Other post-war developments include Scotland Close, Lythe Hill Park and Meadowlands Drive. The Deepdene estate, a mixed estate of houses of varying sizes, was constructed at the west end of Shottermill in the 1980s.

===Haslemere in the world wars===
At the start of the First World War, Haslemere had a population of around 4000, of whom roughly 200 served in the armed forces during the conflict. Since the town was on the route from London to Portsmouth, several army units were billeted nearby while awaiting onward transportation to France. In 1915, Canadian soldiers moved to Bramshott Camp and undertook training in the area.

Around 2,000 children were evacuated from London to the Haslemere area in September 1939, the majority of whom were found accommodation within a radius of the town. The following month, the research division of the Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment, part of HMS &quot;Mercury&quot;, was relocated from Portsmouth to Lythe Hill, a country house to the south east of the town. In 1942, a British Restaurant, a communal kitchen for those who had been bombed out of their homes, opened in Wey Hill, although Haslemere sustained only very limited damage from air raids. Several aeroplanes crashed in the area, including an RAF aircraft close to the Holy Cross Hospital in Shottermill. In the summer of 1944, a V-1 flying bomb landed close to Three Gates Lane, but there were no casualties.

==National and local government==
===UK parliament===
The entirety of the Haslemere civil parish is in the parliamentary constituency of Farnham and Bordon. Prior to 2024 it was in South West Surrey and was represented at Westminster since May 2005 by Conservative Jeremy Hunt. Between 1984 and 2005, the seat was held by Virginia Bottomley, who was elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone in the year she left the House of Commons.

===County Council===
Councillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. Haslemere, Shottermill and Grayswood are in the &quot;Haslemere&quot; electoral division, but Hindhead and Beacon Hill are in the &quot;Waverley Western Villages&quot; electoral division.

===Borough council===
The civil parish is divided between three wards, each of which elect three councillors to Waverley Borough Council. The three wards are &quot;Haslemere East and Grayswood&quot;, &quot;Haslemere Critchmere and Shottermill&quot; and &quot;Hindhead&quot;.

===Town Council===
Haslemere Town Council is the lowest tier of local government in the civil parish. Eighteen councillors are elected every four years. The council is based at Haslemere Town Hall. Each year in May, the councillors elect a Mayor, who serves for a period of one year.

===Twin towns===
Haslemere is twinned with Bernay in France and Horb am Neckar in Germany.

==Demography and housing==


==Public services==
===Utilities===
Before the start of the 16th century, local residents obtained drinking water either from springs or from the River Wey. Haslemere Town Well was dug and there was also a second well, known as Pilewell, in Lower Street. Water would be delivered to homes by a water carrier, the last of whom, Hannah Oakford, died in 1898. The piped water supply to Haslemere began in the 1880s, when a series of pumping stations was installed to deliver water to standpipes in the town from springs on the lower slopes of Blackdown. The Wey Valley Water Company was formed in 1898 and its mains were extended to Shottermill in 1900. In 1907, a public water works was opened close to Chase Farm to serve both settlements. The supply of drinking water to Grayswood began in 1920.
Until the late 19th century, the sewage produced by the town was dumped in cesspits and there are several recorded instances of diphtheria and typhoid outbreaks. The first sewage treatment works in Haslemere was established in Foundry Road in 1898 and a second works followed to the west of Shottermill off Critchmore Lane in 1911. The Shottermill works was enlarged in 1911 and in 1933 became responsible for treating all sewage from the Haslemere UDC area.

The first gas supply to Haslemere began in 1868-69 and was used for street lighting. The gas mains reached Shottermill in 1903. Electric street lighting with sodium lamps was installed between 1952 and 1955.

The Hindhead and District Electric Light Company was formed in 1901 and opened an electricity generating station in Hindhead village in the same year. The first mains electricity cables were laid from Hindhead to Haslemere and Shottermill in 1910.

===Emergency services===
The first known parish constable in the area was serving in Haslemere in 1672, when a staff of office was commissioned. Policing became the responsibility of the Surrey Constabulary on its creation in 1851. The first police officer to be stationed in Grayswood was appointed in 1904. Haslemere Police Station, in West Street, closed in 2012. In 2021, policing in the town is the responsibility of Surrey Police and the nearest police station run by the force is at Guildford.
Construction of the railway line through Haslemere began in 1853 and, by the summer of 1855, around 200 navvies were lodging in the town. On the night of 29 July of that year, a group of workmen was drinking in the Kings Arms pub, when Police Inspector William Donaldson and a junior colleague arrived to enforce the midnight closing time. A fight broke out soon after the navvies left the building, during which Donaldson received a fatal blow to the head. He died at the police station around three hours later. Five men were subsequently arrested, of whom four were convicted of manslaughter at the subsequent trial. Thomas Wood, who is thought to have dealt the fatal blow, was transported to Fremantle, Western Australia after serving a one-year prison sentence in London. Inspector Donaldson was buried in St Bartholomew&#x27;s churchyard in Haslemere. His death is commemorated by a blue plaque on the wall of the Town Hall.
The Haslemere fire brigade was formed in 1877 and, until 1907, was equipped with a horse-drawn fire pump. From 1906, Shottermill was served by the Hindhead and Grayshott brigade, but assistance was given by the Haslemere brigade when necessary. In 2021, the local fire authority is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Haslemere Ambulance Station, in Church Lane, is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===
The first recorded medical healer in Haslemere was Robert Shotter (15531639), of whom the vicar at the time wrote: &quot;An expert chirugeon [surgeon] and cured in his life multitudes of impotent poor people of foul and dangerous sorances [diseases], at his own charge…&quot; In 2021, the GP surgery serving the town is at Haslemere Health Centre, in Church Lane.

The first hospital to be built in Haslemere was a cottage hospital on Shepherd&#x27;s Hill. It opened in 1898 with four beds and its construction was funded by a donation from the Penfold Family. By the early 1920s, it was clear that a new facility was required and a new hospital was opened in 1923 on Church Lane. In 2021, the hospital functions as a community hospital, with a minor injuries unit and two inpatient wards. It also offers a range of outpatient services.

Holy Cross Hospital, to the north of Shottermill, was opened in 1917 as a tuberculosis sanatorium by the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross of Liège. In the 1950s it became a small general hospital and later a specialist facility for oral and facial surgery. Since 1991 it has specialised in the treatment of patients with severe and complex neurological conditions. In 2021, it provides inpatient services for people with severe disabilities and long-term medical conditions. It also offers physiotherapy services to outpatients.
There were two auxiliary hospitals in the Haslemere area during the First World War. Both were affiliates of the Frensham Hill Military Hospital and were named after the country houses in which they were established. High Rough Hospital had 40 beds and was opened on Farnham Lane in May 1915. Church Hill Hospital was opened in April 1917 with 38 beds.

The first dedicated support centre for Haslemere residents with dementia was opened in 1994 at The Marjorie Gray Hall on Grayswood Road, to the north of the town centre. Initially run by the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, responsibility for the centre passed to a dedicated local charity in 2017. The centre provides respite day care four days a week for people with dementia.

The nearest hospital with an accident and emergency department is the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford.

==Transport==
===Roads===

Many of the roads in the area originated as medieval tracks and owing to the local topography, are narrow, twisting and steep. The principal route through Haslemere is the A286, which connects the town with Godalming and Grayswood (to the north) and with Midhurst (to the south). The A287 runs south from Hindhead and passes through the west end of Shottermill, before joining the A286 close to Camelsdale. The main east–west road is the B2131, which links Haslemere to Chiddingfold and Petworth to the east,
and to Liphook to the west.

===Buses===
Haslemere is linked by a number of bus routes to surrounding towns and villages in south west Surrey, West Sussex and east Hampshire. Operators serving the town include Stagecoach and Waverley Hoppa.

===Trains===

Haslemere railway station is to the west of the town centre. It is managed by South Western Railway, which operates all services. Trains run to via and to via .

===Cycling===
The Haslemere Link is a spur of the Surrey Cycleway. It runs north east from the town to join the main circular route to the east of Chiddingfold.

===Long-distance footpaths===
Haslemere is the western terminus of the Greensand Way, a long-distance footpath that runs for along the Greensand Ridge to Hamstreet in Kent. The Serpent Trail links Haslemere to Petersfield via Blackdown and Petworth. The Sussex Border Path runs to the south of Haslemere and Shottermill.

==Education==
===Maintained schools===
St Bartholomew&#x27;s Primary School was founded as a National school . In 1869 a school board was established in Haslemere, which commissioned the construction of a new building adjacent to the parish church. The school moved to its current site on Derby Road in 1986.

Shottermill Infant School and Shottermill Junior School trace their origins to a Church of England school that was opened in the village . Initially there were 40 pupils and only one teacher, but as numbers increased, the school moved to new premises to the north east of Shottermill Church. The building was extended in 1885 and again in 1896–98. In the early 1900s, the infants department became a separate school in its own right and moved to Church Road. In 1927, the county council took over the running of the two schools and constructed new premises for each on Lion Lane.

Grayswood Primary School was founded as a National school in 1862. It moved to its current site, as an infants&#x27; school, in January 1905 with 100 pupils. It was expanded in 2015 to become a primary school, educating up to 210 children between the ages of 4 and 11.

Woolmer Hill School is a secondary school to the north west of Shottermill. It was constructed in 1950 on a site, under the provisions of the Education Act 1944. It became a member of the Weydon Multi-Academy Trust in 2017. In 2021, it educates around 800 students between the ages of 11 and 16.

===Independent schools===
St Ives School, to the north east of Haslemere town centre, is a coeducational prep school for children aged 2–11. It was founded in College Hill in 1911 and moved to its current location in Three Gates Lane in 1966. The school became part of United Learning in September 2013.

The Royal School is a coeducational day and boarding school to the north of Shottermill. It was founded in 1840 as the Royal Naval School and was intended to educate the sisters and daughters of naval and marine officers. It merged in 1995 with The Grove School, also a girls-only school, to create The Royal School. In 2011 the school became co-educational and in 2019 it became part of United Learning.

===Former schools===
Stoatley Rough School was founded in 1934 by Hilde Lion to educate the children of Jewish refugees, who had fled from Nazi Germany. As war approached, the boarding school accepted many children rescued under the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; scheme. After the end of the war it began to focus on educating disadvantaged British pupils. It closed in 1960, following the retirement of its founder.

Wispers School was an independent girls&#x27; boarding school originally founded in 1947. It moved to Oak Hall in 1969 and closed in 2008.

===Religious institute===

The UK campus of the Islamic university, Jamia Ahmadiyya, was founded in Colliers Wood in 2005 and relocated to Haslemere in 2012. It offers a seven-year course to train missionaries from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and educates over 130 students at any one time. The Haslemere campus is a Grade II*-listed former country house, built in 1901, which was the International Education Centre for Olivetti in the early 1970s. Design work for the conversion to an education centre was undertaken by the architects Ted Cullinan and James Stirling and involved the addition of a new classroom wing built from glass-reinforced plastic. In 1997 it became a conference centre, run by the De Vere hotel group, and was acquired by Jamia Ahmadiyya UK in 2012.

==Places of worship==

===St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church===

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church is thought to have been founded as a chapel in the 13th century, and the square tower at the west end is thought to date from this period. The remainder of the building dates from a reconstruction by John Penfold in 1871. The west window of the north aisle is thought to incorporate 17th-century Flemish glass panels and the Holy Grail is illustrated in the Tennyson memorial window, designed by Edward Burne-Jones. The polychromatic marble font dates to 1870 and the organ case incorporates a Morris &amp; Co. tapestry. The wooden pulpit, which features linenfold panelling, dates from the late 19th or early 20th century.

===St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Shottermill===
St Stephen&#x27;s Church was originally built in 1841 as a chapel in the parish of Frensham. The tower was completed in 1846 and the building was consecrated the same year. The chancel was designed by John Penfold and the Lady chapel was added in 1909–10. As part of a renovation undertaken in 2005–06, underfloor heating and a baptismal pool were installed.

===All Saints&#x27; Church, Grayswood===
The ecclesiastical parish of Grayswood was formed in 1901 from parts of the parishes of Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere and Thursley. Alfred Hugh Harman, a local resident, agreed to finance the construction of a church on condition that a new parish was created. All Saints&#x27; Church was designed by the Swedish architect, Axel Haig, in a 13th-century style, influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. The building was completed in 1902 and is constructed of Bargate stone rubble with freestone dressings. The tower has a timber-framed belfry and is topped by a shingled spire. The interior includes an embroidery of the Annunciation, thought to be original, and paintings of Moses and David on linen, attributed to Carl Almquist. In the churchyard is a granite memorial stone to Axel Haig, carved in the shape of a Viking sail, which bears a relief of a longship.

===St Christopher&#x27;s Church===
St Christopher&#x27;s Church was constructed between 1902 and 1904 in the Free Late-Gothic style. It is built from coursed Bargate stone rubble with ironstone galleting. The square tower at the south west corner is topped with a chequerboard decoration, which is also featured on the west gable end. The east window was designed in 1928 in the style of Christopher Whall and the north chapel added in 1935. Between the chancel and nave is a hanging icon of the crucifixion, installed in 1950 in memory of the curate, Christopher Tanner.

===Church of Our Lady of Lourdes===

The Catholic congregation in Haslemere traces its origins to 1908, when Franciscans from Chilworth Friary began to hold regular Masses at Oaklands Hotel. In 1923, the services relocated to the High Street and a year later, the new church was completed. Our Lady of Lourdes was consecrated in 1932 and stained glass windows, designed by Geoffrey Fuller Webb, were installed between 1935 and 1937.

==Culture==
===Art===

Several artists have painted landscapes of the Haslemere area, including George Shalders (-1873), Alexander Fraser (1827–1899), George Vicat Cole (1833–1893) and Cecil Gordon Lawson (1849–1882). The Haslemere Educational Museum holds several artworks, including a bust of Alfred, Lord Tennyson by Thomas Woolner (1825–1892), portraits by Frank Dicksee (1853–1928) and Vera Cummings (1891–1940), as well as several carved wooden figures from the Yoruba School of Nigeria.

Among the works of public art in the town, is a bust of Elizabeth I by Malcolm Stathers, which commemorates the charter issued to Haslemere by the queen. In 2019, a series of four sculptures was commissioned from the artist, Andrew Brighty. The works are inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement and are intended to form part of an arts trail around the town. The first two works, in the High Street and at Clements Corner, were installed in 2020 and are entitled &quot;Progress&quot; and &quot;Mimesis&quot; respectively. The third sculpture, &quot;Serenade to the Sky&quot;, celebrates the area&#x27;s musical connections and was unveiled near Lion Green in March 2021.

===Music===
The musician and instrument maker, Arnold Dolmetsch, was born in France in 1858 and moved with his son, Carl Dolmetsch to Haslemere in 1919. The family repopularised the recorder and began the revival of other early musical instruments. In 1925, they launched the Haslemere Festival, which later became the annual International Dolmetsch Early Music Festival. From 1997 to 2018, the director of the festival was Carl Dolmetsch&#x27;s daughter, Jeanne-Marie Dolmetsch.

Founded as the Haslemere Orchestral Society in 1923, the Haslemere Musical Society acquired its current name in 1939. Among its former conductors are Anthony Bernard, the founder of the London Chamber Orchestra, the composer John Gardner and John Lubbock, founder of the Orchestra of St John&#x27;s Smith Square. In 2007, the society commissioned the choral work &quot;Lord of All Creation&quot; by outgoing conductor, Darrell Davison. The current conductor is James Ross. The society gives regular concerts in the local area and holds an annual &quot;come and sing&quot; event.

The Haslemere Players is an amateur dramatics society and musical theatre group, based in the town. It was officially founded in 1905, but a group had been staging regular performances since the 1890s.

===Haslemere Charter Fair===
Permission to hold an annual fair in the town was first granted by Richard II in 1397 and was confirmed by Elizabeth I in the charter of 1596. The fair was revived in 1984 and is held on the early May bank holiday every two years. The event takes place on the High Street and on West Street, which are closed to traffic for the day. A competition for town criers is held as part of the fair and the winner is awarded the Tennyson Trophy.

Grayswood Village Club was founded in 1905 as a reading room and social space for local residents. The building dates from 1862, when it was constructed as a National school. It was also used as a place of worship from 1884 until the opening of All Saints&#x27; Church in 1902. By 1905, the school had outgrown the premises and moved to a new site. The vacated building was purchased by Frederick Albert Robers and was placed in trust for the village community.

The Haslewey Centre, on Lion Green, has been run as a local community centre by an independent charity since 2003. The centre has been a distribution point for the Meals on Wheels service, run by Waverley Borough Council, since January 2017 and has housed the town post office since January 2018.

The Haslemere Youth Hub, on St Christopher&#x27;s Road, was relaunched in 2019 by Waverley Borough Council. Previously known as the Wey Centre, it had been managed by Surrey County Council. The hub provides a safe space for young people to meet, six days a week, and offers a wide range of activities. The hub houses a counselling service for children as well as a café.

High Lane Community Centre is on Weycombe Road, to the north of the town centre.

===Haslemere Educational Museum===

Haslemere Educational Museum was founded in 1888 by the surgeon, Jonathan Hutchinson, who was an amateur collector of biological, geological and anthropological specimens. Initially the museum was located at Hutchinson&#x27;s Haslemere home, Inval, but moved to its current location on the High Street in 1926. In the same year, it acquired a collection of European Folk Art from the Peasant Arts Museum, which had been located in the town.

===Replica Penfold pillar box===

A replica Victorian pillar box was installed outside the Georgian Hotel on the High Street in July 1992. It is an exact copy of a &quot;Penfold box&quot; which was the standard design used by the Post Office from 1866 to 1879. It honours the local architect, John Penfold, who was responsible for its design.

===Town Hall===

Haslemere Town Hall, at the south end of the High Street, was constructed in 1814. Originally a market house, it replaced an older wooden building, that had stood immediately to the north. It was transferred to the Parish Council in 1897 and the upper floor was used as the debating chamber until 1926, when the UDC moved to the former museum building.

===War memorials===
The limestone war memorial in Haslemere High Street, was designed by Inigo Triggs in 1920–21. It takes the form of a gabled stone cross, supported on an octagonal column, which in turn rests on a stepped stone base. It commemorates 62 local residents who died in WWI, whose names are inscribed on the plinth. The surnames of 47 people who died in the WWII are listed on bronze plaques. A restoration project, undertaken in 2018, included the repair and replacement of damaged stonework and was partly funded by the War Memorials Trust.

The Grayswood war memorial is to the south of the village, on the west side of the A286. It takes the form of a freestanding stone cross and the base is inscribed with the words &quot;Peace to those who died that we might live&quot;. It commemorates 19 local residents who died in WWI and three residents who died in WWII.

===Haste Hill===
Haste Hill is a woodland to the south east of the town, owned by Waverley Borough Council. There was a tenement on the hill in the 14th century and it may have been the site of the original settlement of Haslemere. In the early 18th century, an optical telegraph station, part of the Admiralty Semaphore line between London and Portsmouth was constructed on Haste Hill. It operated from 1822 until 1847, when it was superseded by an electrical telegraph line between the two cities.

===Lion Green===
Lion Green was designated a recreation ground and open space in the Inclosure Act 1845. The green is used for several community events including the annual Haslemere Classic Car Festival and the biennial Haslemere Fringe Festival.

===Recreation ground===
The recreation ground adjoins Scotland Lane and Old Haslemere Road. The land was purchased in 1921 by the War Memorial Committee, using surplus funds donated for the construction of the memorial in the High Street. It was presented to the UDC in the same year, in memory of those who had died in the First World War. In 2015, the recreation ground was legally protected by the charity, Fields in Trust, and was designated a Queen Elizabeth II field.

<doc id="336914" wikidata="Q1723090" url="?curid=336914" title="Fireside chats">
<text>The fireside chats were a series of evening radio addresses given by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, between 1933 and 1944. Roosevelt spoke with familiarity to millions of Americans about recovery from the Great Depression, the promulgation of the Emergency Banking Act in response to the banking crisis, the 1936 recession, New Deal initiatives, and the course of World War II. On radio, he quelled rumors, countered conservative-dominated newspapers, and explained his policies directly to the American people. His tone and demeanor communicated self-assurance during times of despair and uncertainty. Roosevelt was regarded as an effective communicator on radio, and the fireside chats kept him in high public regard throughout his presidency. Their introduction was later described as a &quot;revolutionary experiment with a nascent media platform.&quot;

The series of chats were among the first 50 recordings made part of the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, which noted it as &quot;an influential series of radio broadcasts in which Roosevelt utilized the media to present his programs and ideas directly to the public and thereby redefined the relationship between President Roosevelt and the American people in 1933.&quot;

==Origin==

Roosevelt believed that his administration&#x27;s success depended upon a favorable dialogue with the electorate, possible only through methods of mass communication, and that it would allow him to take the initiative. The use of radio for direct appeals was perhaps the most important of Roosevelt&#x27;s innovations in political communication. Roosevelt&#x27;s opponents had control of most newspapers in the 1930s and press reports were under their control and involved their editorial commentary. Historian Betty Houchin Winfield says, &quot;He and his advisers worried that newspapers&#x27; biases would affect the news columns and rightly so.&quot; Historian Douglas B. Craig says that Roosevelt &quot;offered voters a chance to receive information unadulterated by newspaper proprietors&#x27; bias&quot; through the new medium of radio.

Roosevelt first used what would become known as fireside chats in 1929 as Governor of New York. Roosevelt was a Democrat facing a conservative Republican legislature, so during each legislative session he would occasionally address the residents of New York directly. His third gubernatorial address—April 3, 1929, on WGY radio—is cited by Roosevelt biographer Frank Freidel as being the first fireside chat.
As president, Roosevelt began making the informal addresses on March 12, 1933, eight days after his inauguration. He had spent his first week coping with a month-long epidemic of bank closings that was hurting families nationwide. He closed the entire American banking system on March 6. On March 9, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act, which Roosevelt used to effectively create federal deposit insurance when the banks reopened. At 10 p.m. ET that Sunday night, on the eve of the end of the bank holiday, to a radio audience of more than 60 million people, to tell them in clear language &quot;what has been done in the last few days, why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be&quot;.

The result, according to economic historian William L. Silber, was a &quot;remarkable turnaround in the public&#x27;s confidence...The contemporary press confirms that the public recognized the implicit guarantee and, as a result, believed that the reopened banks would be safe, as the President explained in his first Fireside Chat.&quot; Within two weeks people returned more than half of the cash they had been hoarding, and the first stock-trading day after the bank holiday marked the largest-ever one-day percentage price increase.

The term &quot;fireside chat&quot; was inspired by a statement by Roosevelt&#x27;s press secretary, Stephen Early, who said that the president liked to think of the audience as a few people seated around his fireside. One of the things is that listeners could see Roosevelt in his study, in front of the fireplace, and imagine they were sitting beside him. The term was coined by CBS broadcast executive Harry C. Butcher of the network&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office, in a press release before the address of May 7, 1933. The phrase has often been credited to CBS journalist Robert Trout, but he said he was simply the first to use the phrase on the air. The title was picked up by the press and public and later used by Roosevelt himself, becoming part of American folklore.

==Presentation==

Roosevelt customarily made his address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. He would arrive 15 minutes before air time to welcome members of the press, including radio and newsreel correspondents. NBC White House announcer Carleton E. Smith gave him a simple introduction: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.&quot; Roosevelt most often began his talks with the words, &quot;My friends&quot; or &quot;My fellow Americans&quot;, and he read his speech from a loose-leaf binder. Presidential advisor and speechwriter Samuel Rosenman recalled his use of common analogies and his care in avoiding dramatic oratory: &quot;He looked for words that he would use in an informal conversation with one or two of his friends.&quot; Eighty percent of the words used were in the thousand most commonly used words in the English language.

The radio historian John Dunning wrote that &quot;It was the first time in history that a large segment of the population could listen directly to a chief executive, and the chats are often credited with helping keep Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity high.&quot;

Each radio address went through about a dozen drafts. Careful attention was also given to Roosevelt&#x27;s delivery. When he realized that a slight whistle was audible on the air due to a separation between his two front lower teeth, Roosevelt had a removable bridge made.

Roosevelt is regarded as one of the most effective communicators in radio history. Although the fireside chats are often thought of as having been a weekly event, Roosevelt in fact delivered just 31 addresses during his 4,422-day presidency. He resisted those who encouraged him to speak on radio more frequently, as shown in his response to Russell Leffingwell after the address of February 23, 1942:

The one thing I dread is that my talks should be so frequent as to lose their effectiveness. ... Every time I talk over the air it means four or five days of long, overtime work in the preparation of what I say. Actually, I cannot afford to take this time away from more vital things. I think we must avoid too much personal leadership—my good friend Winston Churchill has suffered a little from this.

==Chronological list of addresses==

==Reception==
Roosevelt&#x27;s radio audiences averaged 18 percent during peacetime, and 58 percent during the war. The fireside chats attracted more listeners than the most popular radio shows, which were heard by 30 to 35 percent of the radio audience. Roosevelt&#x27;s fireside chat of December 29, 1940 was heard by 59 percent of radio listeners. His address of May 27, 1941, was heard by 70 percent of the radio audience.

An estimated 62,100,000 people heard Roosevelt&#x27;s fireside chat on December 9, 1941—two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor—attaining a Hooper rating of 79, the record high for a Presidential address. Approximately 61,365,000 adults tuned on February 23, 1942, for Roosevelt&#x27;s next fireside chat, in which he outlined the principal purposes of the war. In advance of the address Roosevelt asked citizens to have a world map in front of them as they listened to him speak. &quot;I&#x27;m going to speak about strange places that many of them never heard of—places that are now the battleground for civilization,&quot; he told his speechwriters. &quot;I want to explain to the people something about geography—what our problem is and what the overall strategy of the war has to be. ... If they understand the problem and what we are driving at, I am sure that they can take any kind of bad news right on the chin.&quot; Sales of new maps and atlases were unprecedented, while many people retrieved old commercial maps from storage and pinned them up on their walls. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the speech &quot;one of the greatest of Roosevelt&#x27;s career&quot;.

Novelist Saul Bellow recalled hearing a fireside chat while walking in Chicago one summer evening. &quot;The blight hadn&#x27;t yet carried off the elms, and under them, drivers had pulled over, parking bumper to bumper, and turned on their radios to hear Roosevelt. They had rolled down the windows and opened the car doors. Everywhere the same voice, its odd Eastern accent, which in anyone else would have irritated Midwesterners. You could follow without missing a single word as you strolled by. You felt joined to these unknown drivers, men and women smoking their cigarettes in silence, not so much considering the President&#x27;s words as affirming the rightness of his tone and taking assurance from it.&quot;

This level of intimacy with politics made people feel as if they too were part of the administration&#x27;s decision-making process and many soon felt that they knew Roosevelt personally. Most importantly, they grew to trust him. The conventional press grew to love Roosevelt because they too had gained unprecedented access to the goings-on of government.

While many people revered Roosevelt for giving the speeches, there are some who have seen them as more detrimental than beneficial. A major criticism given about the fireside chats was this: &quot;It can be argued that it is impracticable, that it rests on false assumptions about the nature of the American people, public opinion and Congress, and that the benefits of such a course are likely to be out‐weighed by the evils.&quot; Fireside chats are a way to address the public directly, but besides that there is no way to control what the public does with that information, or how they use it. Another major critique among the usage of fireside chats is that by using them, one is more likely going to appeal to one side of an issue, essentially alienating anyone who is not in agreement. &quot;The President may appeal successfully to a minority, even a majority, for its support, but if he does so by simultaneously creating a bitter, recalcitrant opposition that denies his authority and would resort even to violence to resist his policies, can one say that this is a successful President?&quot;

==Legacy==
Every U.S. president since Roosevelt has delivered periodic addresses to the American people, first on radio, and later adding television and the Internet. The practice of regularly scheduled addresses began in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan started delivering a radio broadcast every Saturday. Currently, presidents use newer and more advanced forms of communication using specific social media outlets to project to bigger groups of people. Recent presidents also use news broadcast stations to their benefit to communicate more efficiently with bigger audiences. President Barack Obama used the social media network Twitter for the first time in 2009 to address the public, much like Roosevelt did while giving his famous fireside chats.

===Accolades===
The series of Roosevelt&#x27;s 30 fireside chats were included with the first 50 recordings made part of the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. It is noted as &quot;an influential series of radio broadcasts in which Roosevelt utilized the media to present his programs and ideas directly to the public and thereby redefined the relationship between the President and the American people.&quot;

<text>The M2 is a long motorway in Kent, England, and was built to bypass a section of the A2 road in Kent, which goes through the Medway Towns, Sittingbourne, and Faversham. It provides an alternative route to the Port of Dover, which supplements the M20 motorway located further to the south. The terminal junctions of the M2 intersect with the A2, which come together to form a long trunk road from London to Dover.

==Route==
The M2 starts west of Strood, diverging towards the southeast away from the A2 road. Between J1 and J2, the M2 is four lanes in width, and slopes down into the Medway Valley south of Rochester. J2 is located to the northwest of the left bank of the River Medway, linking the A228 road to the M2, which runs between Strood and West Malling. The junction is in a dumbbell configuration, with a short spur of the A228 providing access to the junction. The M2 drops to three lanes throughout the junction, but returns to a width of four lanes after the junction.

After J2, the motorway passes over the wide Medway Valley via the Medway Viaducts alongside HS1, with the North Downs Way running alongside the eastbound carriageway of the M2 here. It passes over the Medway Valley railway and the aforementioned river. After the viaduct, the M2 runs past the Wouldham marshes and the suburbs of the Medway Towns, which include Borstal, which is well renowned for being the village where HM Prison Rochester is located, and which lends its generic name to institutions for young offenders.

Prior to J3, the M2 ascends a steep valley up to Blue Bell Hill, with the two carriageways on different levels. At J3, the carriageways of the M2 return to the same level and the motorway meets the A229 road, which serves Maidstone) and Walderslade. The junction is in a unique configuration, whereby the M2 and A229 are linked by two grade-separated roundabouts, with the M2 reducing to a width of three lanes after the junction.

As the M2 continues to pass the Medway Towns, it runs along the northern escarpment of the North Downs, and goes past Lidsing and Bredhurst towards J4, where it meets the A278 road at a more conventional grade-separated roundabout junction, reducing to a width of two lanes afterwards.

After J4, traffic on the M2 is able to access a motorway service area named the Medway services, which leads up to J5 a few miles east of the services, where the M2 intersects with the A249 road, which serves Sittingbourne, Sheerness and Maidstone. The junction is in an unconventional grade-separated roundabout configuration, where the slip roads which lead to and from the M2 and roundabout are looped due to the considerable height of the viaduct which the M2 passes over the junction on. Since 2022 the Department of Transport has been undertaking a major reconstruction of the junction due for completion by Winter 2024. 

After J5, the M2 runs for ten miles along the gentle lower slopes of the North Downs as it nears the coast. At J6, the M2 intersects with the A251 road, which serves Faversham one mile to the north and the town of Ashford 13 miles south. The junction is in a parclo configuration. After J6, the M2 ends at J7, which is another conventional grade-separated roundabout. The M2 splits into two lanes prior to ending at J7, with lane 1 heading onto the main roundabout rejoining the A2, which continues onwards to Canterbury () and Dover (), and lane 2 feeding onto the A299 road, commonly known as the Thanet Way, which continues onwards to Whitstable (), Herne Bay (), Margate () and Ramsgate ().

==History==

===Original construction===


The initial section of the M2 between J2 and J5 was opened by the then Transport Minister Ernest Marples on 29 May 1963, and the remainder of the M2 (J1–J2 and J5–J7) was opened in 1965. It was initially referred to as the Medway Towns Motor Road when it was opened, but has been referred to by different names in some official sources.

===Planned extension===
It was planned to extend the M2 to London and Dover, which would have made it the main route between London and the Channel Ports, but this extension never materialised due to a lack of traffic demand. Instead, the A2 was mostly dualled and improved from Brenley Corner to Dover, with separate improvements being carried out on the A2 between London and Strood.

The subsequent Strood to Swanscombe dualling, towards London, of the improved A2, was constructed from 1 June 1964, being seven miles, with a contract of £4,436,869 given to A. Monk Ltd of Padgate, near Warrington; it replaced a single-carriageway three-lane road. Each carriageway had three lanes, with hard shoulders (hardened verge), with four grade-separated junctions. Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son constructed the bridges. The new dual three-lane A2 section was opened at noon on Friday 29 July 1966, with the Bishop of Rochester, David Say, who said a prayer, and George Harris, the managing director of Monk Ltd.

===Numbering===
During planning, the number assigned for the route was the A2(M). However, a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article published on 15 December 1959 erroneously referred to the route as the M2 rather than the A2(M), a number that had been reserved for a route between London and the Channel Ports. After the article was published, the Ministry of Transport assigned the M2 number to the route, while a new number, the M20 was reserved for a route between London and the Channel Ports.

===J1 improvements===
Aside from retrofitting the central crash barriers along the M2, as happened with all early motorways in the UK, the M2 did not change significantly until the 1990s, when the construction of the A289 road to the north of J1 resulted in J1 being reconfigured from a fork configuration to a fork-trumpet hybrid.

===Service area===
The M2 opened with a single service area between junctions 4 and 5, named Farthing Corner services and operated by Top Rank. Today the services are known as Medway services.

The services have an access road to the local network for service and delivery vehicles that is not, as with some motorway service areas, restricted with a gate or barrier. This has led to local businesses using the services as an unofficial exit from the motorway.

===Widening===
While traffic using the M2 decreased when the M20 motorway was completed from London to Folkestone in May 1991, traffic heading into North Kent remained, and congestion along the route was increasing, primarily due to heavy goods vehicles blocking the outside lane. This led to work beginning in 2000 on widening the M2 from two lanes to four lanes between J1 and J3, and three lanes between J3 and J4. A joint venture between Costain, Skanska and Mowlem (CSM) created the company which would complete the project, which required the redesign of J2 and J3, and the construction of a new viaduct next to the existing one over the Medway Valley. The existing viaduct was converted to the four-lane eastbound carriageway of the M2 seen today, with the new viaduct forming the westbound carriageway. High-pressure-water cutting equipment being used to cut concrete into manageable sections for disposal where necessary. The entire stretch was lit with streetlights in contrast to the previously unlit M2. Spoil from the North Downs Tunnel was used to form the new embankment for the westbound carriageway between J2 and the Nashenden Valley. The project was completed in July 2003.

===J5 improvements===

From September 2021, National Highways are carrying out improvements to J5 of the M2, which will involve the construction of a new flyover for A249 traffic heading through the junction and new slip-road connections between the M2 and the A249. Works to realign the slip roads leading from the A249 to the eastbound carriageway were completed in January 2023. New local road links are also being built as part of the scheme. The entire scheme is scheduled for completion in winter 2024.

<doc id="336921" wikidata="Q365919" url="?curid=336921" title="Ahmed Urabi">
<text>Ahmed Urabi (; Arabic: ; 31 March 1841 – 21 September 1911), also known as Ahmed Ourabi or Orabi Pasha, was an Egyptian military officer. He was the first political and military leader in Egypt to rise from the &quot;fellahin&quot; (peasantry). Urabi participated in an 1879 mutiny that developed into the ʻUrabi revolt against the administration of Khedive Tewfik, which was under the influence of an Anglo-French consortium. He was promoted to Tewfik&#x27;s cabinet and began reforms of Egypt&#x27;s military and civil administrations, but the demonstrations in Alexandria of 1882 prompted a British bombardment and invasion which led to the capture of ʻUrabi and his allies and the imposition of British control in Egypt. ʻUrabi and his allies were sentenced by Tewfik into exile far away in British Ceylon, as a form of punishment.

==Early life==
He was born in 1841 in the village of Hirriyat Razna near Zagazig in the Sharqia Governorate, approximately 80 kilometres to the north of Cairo. ʻUrabi was the son of a village leader and one of the wealthier members of the community, which allowed him to receive a decent education. After completing elementary education in his home village, he enrolled at Al-Azhar University to complete his schooling in 1849. He entered the army and moved up quickly through the ranks, reaching lieutenant colonel by age 20. The modern education and military service of ʻUrabi, from a &quot;fellah&quot;, or peasant background, would not have been possible without the modernising reforms of Khedive Isma&#x27;il, who had done much to eliminate the barriers between the bulk of the Egyptian populace and the ruling elite, who were drawn largely from the military castes that had ruled Egypt for centuries. Isma&#x27;il abolished the exclusive access to the Egyptian and Sudanese military ranks by Egyptians of Balkan, Circassian, and Turkish origin. Isma&#x27;il conscripted soldiers and recruited students from throughout Egypt and Sudan regardless of class and ethnic backgrounds in order to form a &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;national&quot; Egyptian military and bureaucratic elite class. Without these reforms, ʻUrabi&#x27;s rise through the ranks of the military would likely have been far more restricted.

ʻUrabi served during the Ethiopian-Egyptian War (1874-1876) in a support role on the Egyptian Army&#x27;s lines of communication. He is said to have returned from the war - which Egypt lost - &quot;incensed at the way in which it had been mismanaged&quot;, and the experience turned him towards politics and decisively against the Khedive.

== Protest against Tewfik ==
He was a galvanizing speaker. Because of his peasant origins, he was at the time, and is still today, viewed as an authentic voice of the Egyptian people. Indeed, he was known by his followers as &#x27;El Wahid&#x27; (the Only One), and when the British poet and explorer Wilfrid Blunt went to meet him, he found the entrance of ʻUrabi&#x27;s house was blocked with supplicants. When Khedive Tewfik issued a new law preventing peasants from becoming officers, ʻUrabi led the group protesting the preference shown to aristocratic officers (again, largely Egyptians of foreign descent). ʻUrabi repeatedly condemned severe prevalent racial discrimination of ethnic Egyptians in the army. He and his followers, who included most of the army, were successful and the law was repealed. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity.

He and his allies in the army joined with the reformers in February 1882 to demand change. This revolt, also known as the ʻUrabi revolt, was primarily inspired by his desire for social justice for the Egyptians based on equal standing before the law. With the support of the peasants as well, he launched a broader effort to try to wrest Egypt and Sudan from foreign control, and also to end the absolutist regime of the Khedive, who was himself subject to European influence under the rules of the Caisse de la Dette Publique. The Arab-Egyptian deputies demanded a constitution that granted the state parliamentary power. The revolt then spread to express resentment of the undue influence of foreigners, including the predominantly Turko-Circassian aristocracy from other parts of the Ottoman Empire.

== Parliament planning ==
ʻUrabi was first promoted to Bey, then made under-secretary of war, and ultimately a member of the cabinet. Plans were developed to create a parliamentary assembly. During the last months of the revolt (July to September 1882), it was claimed that ʻUrabi held the office of Prime Minister of the hastily created common law government based on popular sovereignty. Feeling threatened, Khedive Tewfik requested assistance against ʻUrabi from the Ottoman Sultan, to whom Egypt and Sudan still owed technical fealty. The Sublime Porte hesitated in responding to the request.

== British intervention ==

The British were especially concerned that ʻUrabi would default on Egypt&#x27;s massive debt and that he might try to gain control of the Suez Canal. Therefore, they and the French dispatched warships to Egypt to prevent such an eventuality from occurring. Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to Alexandria. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion (as had been the case in Tunisia in 1881) causing anti-Christian riots to break out in Alexandria on 12 June 1882. The French fleet was recalled to France, while the Royal Navy warships in the harbor opened fire on the city&#x27;s artillery emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them.

The Battle of Kassassin was fought at the Sweet Water Canal, when on August 28, 1882, the British force was attacked by the Egyptians, led by &#x27;Urabi. They needed to carve a passage through Ismailia and the cultivated Delta. Both attacks were repulsed. The Household Cavalry under the command of General Drury Drury-Lowe led the &quot;Moonlight Charge&quot;, consisting of the Royal Horse Guards and 7th Dragoon Guards galloping at full tilt into enemy rifle fire. Their ranks were whittled down from the saddle, but still they charged headlong, ever forward. Sir Baker Russell commanded 7th on the right; whereas the Household was led by Colonel Ewart, c/o of the Life Guards. They captured 11 Egyptian guns. Despite only half a dozen casualties, Wolseley was so concerned about the quality of his men that he wrote Cambridge for reforms to recruiting. Nonetheless, these were the elite of the British army and, these skirmishes were costly. Legend and a poem &quot;At Kassassin&quot;, say the battle began as it was getting dark.

On September 9, Urabi seized what he considered his last chance to attack the British position. A fierce battle ensued on the railway line at 7 am. General Willis sallied out from emplacements to drive back the Egyptians, who at 12 pm returned to their trenches. Thereupon Sir Garnet Wolseley arrived with the main force, while the Household Cavalry guarded his flank from a force at Salanieh. A total force of 634 officers and 16,767 NCOs and men were stationed at Kassassin before they marched on September 13, 1882, towards the main objective at Tell El Kebir where another battle was fought, the Battle of Tell El Kebir.

In September a British army landed in Alexandria but failed to reach Cairo after being checked at the Battle of Kafr El Dawwar. Another army, led by Sir Garnet Wolseley, landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated ʻUrabi&#x27;s army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. From there, the British force advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired, as did ʻUrabi and the other nationalist leaders.

== Exile and return ==
ʻUrabi was tried by the restored Khedivate for rebellion on 3 December 1882. He was defended by British solicitor Richard Eve and Alexander Meyrick Broadley. According to Elizabeth Thompson, ʻUrabi&#x27;s defense stressed the idea that despite the fact that he had been illegally incarcerated by Riyad Pasha and the Khedive Tewfik he had still responded in a manner allowed under Egyptian law and with the hopes that the khedivate remain after his intervention, thus demonstrating loyalty to the Egyptian people as required by his duties. In accordance with an understanding made with the British representative, Lord Dufferin, ʻUrabi pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to one of banishment for life. He left Egypt on 28 December 1882 for Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). His home in Halloluwa Road, Kandy (formerly owned by Mudaliyar Jeronis de Soysa) is now the Orabi Pasha Cultural Center. During his time in Ceylon, ʻUrabi worked to improve the quality of education amongst the Muslims in the country. Hameed Al Husseinie College, Sri Lanka&#x27;s first school for Muslims was established on 15 November 1884 and after eight years Zahira College, was established on 22 August 1892 under his patronage. In May 1901, Khedive Abbas II, Tewfik&#x27;s son and successor permitted ʻUrabi to return to Egypt. Abbas was a nationalist in the vein of his grandfather, Khedive Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent, and remained deeply opposed to British influence in Egypt. ʻUrabi returned on 1 October 1901, and remained in Egypt until his death on 21 September 1911.

==Legacy==
While the British intervention was meant to be a temporary state of affairs, British forces continued to occupy Egypt for decades afterwards. In 1914, fearing that the nationalist Khedive Abbas II would form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire against the United Kingdom during the First World War, the British administration in Egypt deposed him in favour of his uncle, Hussein Kamel. The legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty was terminated, and the Sultanate of Egypt that had been destroyed by the Ottomans in 1517 was re-established, with Hussein Kamel as Sultan. No longer an Ottoman vassal state, Egypt was declared a British protectorate. Five years later, nationalist opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued dominance of Egyptian affairs sparked the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, prompting the British to formally recognise Egypt as an independent sovereign state in 1922.

ʻUrabi&#x27;s revolt had a profound and long-lasting impact on Egypt, surpassing even the efforts of resistance hero Omar Makram in its significance as an expression of nationalistic sentiments in Egypt. It would later play a very important role in Egyptian history, with some historians noting that the 1881-1882 revolution laid the foundation for mass politics in Egypt. In July 1952, when Mohamed Naguib, one of the two principal leaders of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, addressed crowds of supporters in Cairo&#x27;s Ismailia Square on the toppling of King Farouk, he consciously linked this 20th century revolution to &#x27;Urabi&#x27;s revolt against the Egyptian monarch seven decades earlier, reciting &#x27;Urabi&#x27;s words to Khedive Tewfik that the people of Egypt were &quot;no longer inheritable&quot; by any ruler. The new revolutionary government mimicked &#x27;Urabi in declaring that Ismailia Square, the main public plaza in Cairo, henceforth be Tahrir Square (&quot;Liberation Square&quot;). During the tenure of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who led the Revolution with Naguib and succeeded him as Prime Minister and later President, ʻUrabi would to be hailed as an Egyptian patriot and a national hero. He also inspired political activists living in Ceylon.

==Tributes==
===Egypt===
* Alexandria&#x27;s Orabi Square
* Cairo&#x27;s Al Mohandessin district has a main street and its underground station named after him.
* Zagazig&#x27;s main square contains an equestrian statue of ʻUrabi, and its university&#x27;s emblem bears his picture

===Abroad===
* Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, was named in honour of &#x27;Urabi as the residents of the suburb felt a sense of solidarity with him due to the fact that they were a part of New Orleans which sought to separate from the city.
* The Gaza Strip has a coastal road named Ahmed Orabi Street.
* Colombo&#x27;a , Sri Lanka, has an Orabi Pasha Street in its central district.
* Kandy, Sri Lanka, is home to the Orabi Pasha Cultural Centre.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;How can you enslave people when their mothers bore them free?&quot;. The reference is: Once, a governor of Egypt punished a non-Muslim wrongly. The case was brought to the caliph of time (i.e. Umar ibn ul Khattab, the second Caliph of Islam) and the Muslim governor was proven to be wrong. Umar told the non-Muslim to punish the governor in same fashion, after it Umar said: Since when have you considered people as your slaves? Although their mothers gave birth to them as free living people.
* &quot;Allah has created us free, and did not make us into heritage or estate. So by Allah, the only god, we shall be bequeathed or enslaved no more&quot;

== Notes ==
* The earliest published work of Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory – later to embrace Irish Nationalism and have an important role in the cultural life of Ireland – was &quot;Arabi and His Household&quot; (1882), a pamphlet (originally a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper) in support of ʻUrabi.

<doc id="336922" wikidata="Q367909" url="?curid=336922" title="M50 motorway (Ireland)">
<text>The M50 motorway () is a C-shaped orbital motorway in Dublin and the busiest motorway in Ireland. The current route was built in various sections over the course of 27 years, from 1983 to 2010. It begins at Dublin Port, running northward through the Dublin Port Tunnel and along a portion of the Airport Motorway. It then turns west at its junction with the M1, circling the northern, western and southern suburbs of Dublin, before merging with the M11 at Shankill in South East Dublin. The road forms part of European route E01.

An orbital motorway for Dublin was first proposed in the Dublin Transportation Study of 1971. Construction began on the first section, the Western Parkway (J6-J11) in 1987, and opened to traffic in 1990. This was followed by the Northern Cross Route (J3-J6) in 1996, the Southern Cross Route (J11-J13) in 2001, and the Southeastern Motorway (J13-J17) in 2005. The M50 route was extended to Dublin Port in 2006, via a section of the 1985 Airport Motorway (up to then a part of the M1) and the newly opened Dublin Port Tunnel.

A massive upgrade project commenced in early 2006 due to the motorway&#x27;s chronic capacity problems. Lanes were added J3-J13, and many of the low-capacity roundabout interchanges were replaced with free-flowing interchanges. These upgrades were completed in 2010.

Motorists have paid nearly €2.2 billion in M50 tolls between the 2008 State buyout and early 2025 

==Layout==
The M50 was originally planned to divert traffic travelling on National Primary Routes away from the city (a full bypass of Dublin). Due to urban expansion and sprawl, it now runs through Dublin&#x27;s suburbs and serves as a route within Dublin, connecting the suburbs.

All of the National Primary Routes radiating from Dublin begin at their junctions with the M50. The junctions were originally in the form of grade-separated signal-controlled roundabout junctions, not free-flowing interchanges. The M50 mainline itself was free-flow through all junctions. The other primary routes served are the N1/M1 to Belfast/Dundalk/Newry, N2 to Derry/Monaghan, N3 to Cavan/Donegal/Navan, N4/M4 (N5) (M6) to Galway/Sligo/Westport, N7/M7 (M8) (M9) to Cork/Limerick/Waterford, and the N11/M11 to Wexford/Wicklow. Additional junctions along the motorway serve other suburbs of Dublin such as Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Cherrywood, Dundrum, Sandyford and Tallaght.

Most of these interchanges were subject to high levels of traffic congestion, as was the former toll plaza north of the West-Link bridge. The busier roundabout junctions were signal-controlled, with tailbacks extending for several kilometres at rush hour. The most infamous was the Red Cow Roundabout junction with the N7, jokingly dubbed the &quot;Mad Cow Roundabout&quot;. As well as being the junction of two of the busiest roads in the State, the Luas tram Red Line from Tallaght to the city centre used to cross two slip roads at-grade, before continuing city-bound in the median of the R110 (formerly N7). As part of the M50 upgrade works (see below), these at-grade crossings were removed, and in December 2008, the completely reconstructed interchange was open. This greatly reduced the congestion at the once-notorious traffic black spot.

The roundabout at the N3 is also notable as the Royal Canal and the Dublin-Sligo railway line pass through its centre.

The original speed limit on the M50 was 70 mph (112 km/h). The Southern Cross Route from J12-J13 was given a lower limit of 60 mph (96 km/h), due to its more undulating, twisting route. The route from J3-J13 was changed to 100 km/h after the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s speed limits became metric in 2005, while the Southeastern Motorway section (J13-J17) became 120 km/h. The Airport Motorway-Port Tunnel section of the route from J1-J3 has a speed limit of 80 km/h due to the closely packed junctions and heavy volume of weaving traffic. Average speed camera technology is in operation in the Port Tunnel section of the M50.

Continues as M11.
The &quot;South Eastern Motorway&quot; section, a radial route, was originally meant to be part of the M11. It curves away from the city centre and instead joins the N11 at junction 17 heading south. The next opportunity to exit the motorway is at the Bray North exit 5 of the M11.

There is no Junction 8, the junction number having been reserved for a potential extension of the M7 motorway from Lucan/Clondalkin to Naas. This is unlikely to be built given that the N7 Naas Road has been upgraded to dual three-lane with at-grade junctions converted to grade-separated interchanges or left-in, left-out (LILOs) junctions. However, it is an objective of South Dublin County Council to construct a new junction and use it to provide local access to the Cloverhill area of Palmerstown. This is also very unlikely to happen as the NRA have stated they are against the provision of new interchanges on the existing M50 as they are seen to contribute to traffic congestion on the route and undermine its function as a motorway.

==Future plans==

Completion of Dublin&#x27;s ring road by the building of an Eastern Bypass of the city has been proposed. This plan is controversial, as it would require a tunnel across Sandymount Strand to or possibly through Booterstown marsh bird sanctuary. A motorway reservation from Sandyford to Booterstown was included in the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown Development Plan, with space allowed for an interchange where it crosses the N11. The Dublin Port Tunnel, which opened on 20 December 2006, would form the northern half of the Eastern bypass. This project was cancelled in 2009.

Another outer orbital road has been proposed for the Dublin region. It will, if approved, run approximately from Drogheda via Navan, Trim and Kilcock towards Naas.

<doc id="336926" wikidata="Q4049985" url="?curid=336926" title="Spümcø">
<text>Spümcø, Inc. ( ; stylized as SPüMCø) was an American animation studio that was active from 1989 to 2005 and based in Los Angeles, California. The studio was best known for working on the first two seasons of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; for Nickelodeon and for various commercials. The studio won several awards, including an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject for the music video of the song &quot;I Miss You&quot; by Björk.

Spümcø was founded by animators John Kricfalusi, Bob Camp, Jim Smith and Lynne Naylor. Kricfalusi named the company after the fictional person &quot;Raymond Spüm&quot;, whom he jokingly described as the inventor of animation. The golden age of American animation (exemplified by the 1940s cartoons by Bob Clampett and Tex Avery) served as inspiration for the surreal and highly expressive house style of which Spümcø became well-known.

==History==
===Origins===

In the 1980s, animators John Kricfalusi and Lynne Naylor attempted to sell original cartoon ideas while working for various animation studios, including Filmation. Spümcø was officially founded in Hollywood in 1989 by cartoonists Kricfalusi, Naylor, Bob Camp and Jim Smith, who were all disappointed at the state of animation and had either been laid off or quit from other animation companies. Soon thereafter, Nickelodeon announced that they were looking for new cartoons created by cartoonists.

Kricfalusi explains the name Spümcø: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s a weird coincidence. The word &quot;spüm&quot; is the word for &#x27;quality&#x27; in Danish. But it&#x27;s actually named after Raymond Spüm, the guy who invented animation in 1856.&quot; Despite Kricfalusi&#x27;s claims, &quot;Spüm&quot; is actually not a Danish word and Raymond Spüm is a fictional figure.

The Spümcø headquarters were located in Los Angeles, west of Paramount Studios at 5625 Melrose Avenue in a bland concrete industrial building. Amy Harmon of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the &quot;not-quite-underground headquarters&quot; as &quot;a nondescript building&quot;.

===&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;===
A few months after founding Spümcø, Kricfalusi pitched five cartoon ideas to Nickelodeon. Geraldine Laybourne, the president of Nickelodeon at the time, picked two of these: &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and &quot;Jimmy the Idiot Boy&quot;, the former being initially rejected by three other major American television networks. Ultimately, Kricfalusi decided to sell &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; to Nickelodeon, which led to Spümcø&#x27;s first animated series production, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;.

Because Nickelodeon had no original cartoon material prior to the hiring of Kricfalusi, the network was unaware of the basic process of producing an animated cartoon. Kricfalusi volunteered to give Nickelodeon executives an informative background of cartoonists using storyboards for storytelling in animated cartoons, rather than a script. Vanessa Coffey, who became the executive for &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, listened to Kricfalusi&#x27;s lessons and background briefing of the animation industry, and was pleased to learn about how the process works. Coffey agreed with Kricfalusi that, &quot;If storyboards were good enough for Bugs Bunny, they were good enough for her.&quot;

Spümcø finished the pilot &quot;Big House Blues&quot; in October 1990 and it aired on August 11, 1991, premiering alongside &quot;Doug&quot; and &quot;Rugrats&quot;. Spümcø continued to produce the show for the next two years, while encountering issues with Nickelodeon&#x27;s standards and practices. Over the next couple of years, a number of episodes were censored.

Kricfalusi described Nickelodeon in the earliest period as being &quot;simple&quot; as there was one executive, Coffey, whom he said that he got along with. Kricfalusi said that another executive, who came during a later period in the show, tried to prevent some of the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; episodes from being produced. According to Kricfalusi, the episodes continued production since he had established a &quot;trade&quot; with Coffey of balancing &quot;really crazy&quot; episodes with &quot;heart-warming&quot; episodes.

===After Nickelodeon===
Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi in 1992, and Nickelodeon moved production from Spümcø to Games Animation. Kricfalusi confirmed that the primary reason for the Nickelodeon executives&#x27; decision seemed to be due to the level of violence in &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;. He specifically referred to the episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, which features Ren beating the character George Liquor with an oar, as the probable cause for his firing. Nickelodeon banned the episode from airing; the episode did not air in North America until &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot; began in 2003.

Bill Wray, a production artist for &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;, described the main issues regarding Kricfalusi&#x27;s conflict with Nickelodeon as not being able to meet deadlines for production. Wray stated that Kricfalusi attributed the delays to Nickelodeon &quot;not approving things fast enough&quot;, and Nickelodeon staff members &quot;changing their minds&quot; over what can or cannot be produced. Wray said that Kricfalusi believed that the product&#x27;s quality holds more importance than meeting deadlines, and that he perceived Nickelodeon as &quot;slowing him down&quot;. According to Wray, Kricfalusi believed, &quot;[E]very step after the storyboards weakens the process&quot;, and that he &quot;fought for the integrity of the storyboards&quot;, and lengthened production time because he wished to salvage the quality of the series. Wray stated, &quot;On some occasions Kricfalusi completed an episode in eight months. Other occasions, he completed an episode in two or three months.&quot; Wray described Kricfalusi&#x27;s ideal production period per episode as four half-hour cartoons per year, and added that the arrangement would not &quot;jibe with our production schedule&quot;.

Kevin Kolde became a key figure of the company, working as a vice president and general manager, enabling Spümcø to continue producing content for over a decade after the original run of &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;.

In 1997, Björk, a long-time fan of Kricfalusi&#x27;s work, insisted on him doing an animated music video for her when they met at one of her concerts. Kricfalusi subsequently directed the music video for &quot;I Miss You&quot;, a single that was released the same year. It premiered on MTV as well as Canada&#x27;s MuchMusic channel and Asia&#x27;s Channel V. &quot;I Miss You&quot; won an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject in 1997, from the International Animated Film Association, ASIFA-Hollywood.

A variety of techniques were used for the production of the video: traditional 2-D cel animation by Spümcø and Colorkey Productions; 3-D computer animation supervised by Charlie Gibson at Rhythm &amp; Hues; real-time motion capture animation by House of Moves; and blue screen mattes brought live-action into the mix. The live-action sequences with Björk were shot in a Los Angeles studio in one day. The entire music video took nine months to complete.

In 1997, Spümcø launched their very own website to distribute cartoons without television network censorship. Kricfalusi decided to use George Liquor, a cartoon character he created, to star in the Flash Internet cartoon series &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot;. The series premiered on October 15, 1997. &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot; was the first cartoon series to be produced exclusively for the Internet. George appeared on the series with: his nephew, Jimmy The Idiot Boy; Jimmy&#x27;s cousins, Slab and Ernie; Jimmy&#x27;s love interest, Sody Pop; and George and Jimmy&#x27;s pet dog, Dirty Dog. Spümcø produced eight one-minute shorts. In 1999, &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot; won an Annie Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Interactive Production&quot;.

In 1999, Spümcø created its second Internet-only cartoon series, &quot;Weekend Pussy Hunt&quot;. The series had 12 episodes, with 4 cartoons unfinished due to budget problems. The series starred Dirty Dog and Cigarettes the Cat. When asked about the style of the cartoon series, creator Kricfalusi stated:

In 1999, Spümcø produced and animated a Yogi Bear television special parody titled &quot;Boo Boo Runs Wild&quot;, which premiered on September 24, 1999, on Cartoon Network as part of the Yogi Bear marathon. The animated short focuses on Yogi Bear&#x27;s sidekick, Boo Boo Bear, who becomes fed up with the rules of man and decides to return to his natural bear roots. Though it focused primarily on Yogi and Boo Boo, it was titled as a &quot;Ranger Smith cartoon&quot;. A second Ranger Smith cartoon aired alongside it, titled &quot;A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith&quot;, as well as two &quot;Jetsons&quot; cartoons titled &quot;Father &amp; Son Day&quot; and &quot;The Best Son&quot;.

===Later years and closure===
After Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi from &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; in September 1992, he had plans to make a feature film starring the world&#x27;s &quot;manliest men&quot;. The feature film plan was scrapped, but the characters were then used in the 2001 animated series, &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot;. As early as a 1987 story session for the &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, Kricfalusi had proposed using a wad of gum as a character, an idea which was used to create the first villain for the new series, &quot;Indigestible Wad&quot;. &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; premiered on September 22, 2001, and ran until January 26, 2002.

During 2002, after &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; had been cancelled, Kricfalusi was contacted by cable network TNN (later Spike TV, now Paramount Network) which was struggling for ratings and needed a new audience. In June 2003, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot; premiered with three episodes, ones which used plots developed for &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. The entire show was produced by Spümcø, which had complete creative control over the content. The animation was produced by Carbunkle Cartoons and PiP Animation Services. The series also premiered along with a formerly censored episode from the first two seasons of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. The plot of &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; focused on the adventures of the duo from the original cartoon series. Six episodes were originally meant to air during the summer of 2003, but were delayed for a year along with the rest of Spike TV&#x27;s &quot;Strip&quot;, mainly because of the risqué &quot;Naked Beach Frenzy&quot; episode. Spike TV planned to bring the show back with the final remaining episodes on August 20, 2004, but delayed the series and cancelled it in early July 2003. On July 18, 2006, Paramount Home Entertainment released a DVD collection titled &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy: The Lost Episodes&quot;, which contained uncensored versions of all of the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot; episodes.

In these years, Spümcø co-produced three video games for which they provided character designs and animations. The first two games were &quot;Yoake no Mariko&quot; and &quot;Yoake no Mariko 2nd Act&quot;, two voice acting simulation games in which the goal is for the player to deliver fitting performances of lines from movie scenes of different genres that are playing on-screen. The games were developed in collaboration with Sony Computer Entertainment, and released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation 2 on December 6, 2001, and January 24, 2002, respectively. The third and final game was &quot;Go! Go! Hypergrind&quot;, a skateboarding game released on the GameCube by Atlus in North America on November 18, 2003. It features a crew of 11 animated characters who compete to become the next star of an upcoming Spümcø animated show on extreme skateboarding. The game&#x27;s story states that &quot;Toon World&quot; is helping Spümcø &quot;to renew interest in the medium and revive the struggling economy [of traditional cel animation]&quot;.

On July 18, 2005, Kricfalusi decided to shut down Spümcø shortly thereafter, following a lawsuit by Carbunkle which was filed against Spümcø in the Canadian court system over royalties and credit for Bob Jaques&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;. In the summer of 2008, Kricfalusi made a partial payment to Jaques after Jaques had ceased seeking legal action against him. The Spümcø trademark expired in 2007.

===Legacy===
Spümcø&#x27;s influence on Nickelodeon Animation Studio was immaculate, as basically every person of note who worked at Spümcø had varying involvement in productions by the studio. Doug Lawrence, a layout assistant on the show, became a key writer on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;; he would also do so for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Members who initially refused to join Games Animation, including Vincent Waller and Richard Pursel, co-founders Bob Camp and Lynne Naylor, Games Animation hires Chris Reccardi and William Wray as well as later Spümcø employees including Aaron Springer would work on &quot;SpongeBob&quot; of varying capacities; Waller serves as a showrunner on the series as of 2024. Jim Smith also joined the studio to work for &quot;The X&#x27;s&quot;, with Kricfalusi apparently allowed to return for a voice cameo.

In 2016, it was announced on Tumblr that Kricfalusi and former Cartoon Network storyboard artist Gabe Del Valle were starting a new studio based in the Los Angeles area and were seeking new employees. The name of the studio was not included in the announcement, but was inferred to be &quot;Spümtwø&quot; by the presence of &quot;spumtwo&quot; in the contact email. However, the announcement was removed from Del Valle&#x27;s Tumblr account sometime afterward, most likely due to Del Valle being rehired by Cartoon Network shortly afterward.

On March 4, 2017, Kricfalusi announced a second new studio to be based in Miami, Florida, named John K. Studios. The studio&#x27;s only project was an animated short for Adult Swim, which advertised the then-upcoming UFC 200 match on July 9, 2016, produced prior to the announcement of forming the company. The short was referred to as the &quot;big project&quot; in Del Valle&#x27;s previous announcement. However, as of July 2018, the studio website is offline.

==Documentary==
In 2013, a website was created to promote a documentary about the Spümcø animation studio. A teaser trailer was posted on Vimeo which included brief interviews with Kricfalusi, Spümcø staffer Eddie Fitzgerald and self-proclaimed Spümcø fan and singer-songwriter &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, and clips from &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and other former Spümcø series, giving the impression that it was authorized by Kricfalusi. However, sometime in 2014 or 2015 the website was taken down and the Vimeo account was deleted without notice or explanation. Many of Kricfalusi&#x27;s fans were left wondering if the people involved in the project were unable to get further funding or a distribution agreement or that they could not obtain the proper licensing to use clips.

On February 1, 2013, &quot;Sick Little Monkeys: The Unauthorized Ren and Stimpy Story&quot; was published by animation historian Thad Komorowski. The book contains the detailed history of Spümcø and the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; cartoons.

<text>Relayer is the seventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released in November 1974 by Atlantic Records. After keyboardist Rick Wakeman left the group in May 1974 over disagreements with the band&#x27;s direction following their double concept album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973), Yes entered rehearsals as a four-piece in Buckinghamshire. They auditioned several musicians, including Greek keyboardist and composer Vangelis, before settling with Swiss musician Patrick Moraz of Refugee who incorporated elements of funk and jazz fusion to the album. &quot;Relayer&quot; is formed of three tracks, with &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; on side one and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and &quot;To Be Over&quot; on side two.

&quot;Relayer&quot; received a mixed to positive reception from contemporary and retrospective critics. It reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A single of the closing section of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;, titled &quot;Soon&quot;, was released in January 1975. After touring in support of the album between November 1974 and July 1975, Yes went on a year-long hiatus. &quot;Relayer&quot; continued to sell, and is certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over 500,000 copies in the US. It was remastered in 2003 and in 2014, both with previously unreleased tracks; the latter includes new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes and additional tracks.

==Background==
In April 1974, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White wrapped their 1973–1974 tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973). The album had been a success for the band, reaching number one in the UK for two weeks, and became the first to be certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry based solely on pre-orders. Despite the success, Wakeman informed the band of his decision to leave midway into the tour, following his disagreements and frustration with the direction the band had taken with the album. His exit was made public on 8 June, and he resumed his already successful solo career.

Reduced to a four-piece, Yes retreated to Farmyard Studios, a rehearsal and recording facility owned by drummer Trevor Morais in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, and worked on new songs. After some material had been arranged, auditions for a new keyboardist began and around eight players were invited, including Jean Roussel, Eddie Jobson, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Greek musician and composer Vangelis. Others were flown in from the US and Germany. Anderson was a fan of Vangelis and visited his Paris flat several months earlier when Yes were in town performing &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;. Vangelis agreed to an audition and shipped his keyboards to the rehearsal studio, but the group discovered he was non-committal about the role and too strong a personality for a group. Atlantic Records vice president Phil Carson added that his fear of flying caused further complications, and a subsequent rejection from the Musicians Union ended the possibility of Vangelis joining the band. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter Chris Welch suggested that the band try Patrick Moraz, a Swiss musician and film composer with a background in jazz and classical music, and a member of the progressive and jazz fusion trio Refugee. Within a week Moraz accepted an invitation from Brian Lane, the band&#x27;s manager, to an audition. Moraz was a fan of the band and had met the original line-up in Switzerland in 1969.

Moraz arrived at Farmyard Studios in the first week of August 1974, and saw each band member arrive in his own expensive car. He said: &quot;Coming from Refugee, where we had been walking three miles to and from our rehearsal place ... it was quite a contrast!&quot; Vangelis&#x27;s keyboards were still situated in the studio, and Moraz used them for his audition. After tuning up he played some parts to display his ability, including a short section of &quot;And You and I&quot; from &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972), causing the band to stop talking and gather around him. Moraz&#x27;s first task was to devise a section to complement what they had written for the middle section of &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;. The band liked what he played, and on the following day, Lane informed Moraz that his audition was a success. Moraz accepted the offer, but felt some pressure to deliver, and drove from his flat in Earl&#x27;s Court near central London to the studio each day to record and learn the band&#x27;s repertoire.

==Writing and recording==
Having made the 80-minute &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; with such a &quot;tight&quot; musical structure, Anderson wanted to explore music that was &quot;so outrageously different&quot; on &quot;Relayer&quot;. He was particularly influenced by electronic music compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen and &quot;Wings of the Delirious Demon&quot; (1972) by Turkish-American musician İlhan Mimaroğlu. Anderson recalled that he and Moraz shared an interest to make something &quot;very modern&quot; at the time, and went as far to suggest the band make &quot;free form music without thought, which everybody thought I was going a little too far&quot;. &quot;Relayer&quot; takes the same form as &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972), which features one track occupying side one and two songs on side two. The band wrote two additional tracks during rehearsals but did not have enough time to record them in the studio; Anderson described one as &quot;absolutely crazy and intricate&quot;. For the majority of his keyboard parts, Moraz did not write the music on paper and instead relied on his memory except for some particularly precise sections. Howe&#x27;s main guitar on the album is a 1955 Fender Telecaster, marking a stylistic departure from his usual Gibson and Les Paul models that he had used on earlier albums. He also uses a pedal steel and electric sitar. Squire uses a Fender Jazz Bass on &quot;To Be Over&quot;, a departure from his usual Rickenbacker 4001.
Following rehearsals at Farmyard Studios, the band decided to record &quot;Relayer&quot; at Squire&#x27;s home at New Pipers in Virginia Water, Surrey, which he had purchased in Christmas 1972. This marked the first time Yes had made an album outside of London, and the location served as a cost-cutting measure by eliminating the need to pay for time in a professional studio, thus giving the band more time to work on the music. They were joined by Eddy Offord, who had worked with the band since 1970 as their engineer and later co-producer and live sound mixer. Offord installed a mobile 24-track recording machine and mixing desk in Squire&#x27;s basement, and enlisted Genaro Rippo as tape operator. &quot;Relayer&quot; was the final Yes album with Offord before he left in 1975 to work with other groups. He later stated that his time with the band had become &quot;a bit stale&quot;, but made brief returns during the recording of &quot;Drama&quot; (1980) and &quot;Union&quot; (1991). Recording sessions typically lasted for eight or nine hours. Moraz wished Offord was &quot;a little less stoned&quot; during recording as it affected the album&#x27;s production quality, ranking it inferior to Offord&#x27;s work on &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971) and albums with Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer. Mixing was completed at Advision Studios in London.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; is a 21-minute track that Anderson described as &quot;a war song, a battle scene, but it&#x27;s not to explain war or denounce it ... There&#x27;s a prelude, a charge, a victory tune, and peace at the end, with hope for the future.&quot; He originally planned to base the entire album on the literary work &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy, but instead opted for a side-long track inspired by its themes. Moraz recalled a discussion about the story with Anderson as they had both read it, after which Moraz presented him with a copy of &quot;Délirius&quot;, a French science fiction graphic novel by Philippe Druillet. Moraz said: &quot;He related to it immediately so I think that perhaps as a title &#x27;The Gates of Delirium&#x27; came from that&quot;.

The song originated from several short themes that Anderson had amassed in his head and played them to the group on a piano &quot;very badly&quot;; he was relieved when his bandmates understood what he was trying to do. Anderson and Howe kept track of its structure by recording sections of it on cassette tapes, leaving Anderson to figure out the next part as the group would develop what was put down prior. The song was recorded in sections at a time, though the group was familiar with the entire piece beforehand and spent several weeks recording takes of each section and selecting the ones the members felt were the strongest. Once picked, the sections were edited together and overdubs were then recorded. The battle section includes crashing sound effects that were created by White pushing over a tower of used car parts that he and Anderson had collected from a scrap yard. Howe remembered Anderson becoming too excited in what he envisaged the battle to be, leading the group to produce one mix that was &quot;too far gone&quot; and another &quot;too safe&quot;. Following the battle, the track concludes with a gentle song that later became known as &quot;Soon&quot;. Anderson later thought that &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; did not come across effectively on record, but fared better in concert.

===Side two===
&quot;Sound Chaser&quot; contains elements of jazz fusion and funk arrangements. Moraz was asked to devise an introduction to the song during his audition with the band; his contribution was finalised after &quot;one or two takes&quot; and used on the final version. He considered his Moog synthesizer solo at the end a highlight moment in his performance on the album, but felt that the keyboards overall were buried in the final mix. Howe thought the track was &quot;an indescribable mixture of Patrick&#x27;s jazzy keyboards and my weird sort of flamenco electric [guitar]&quot;, yet he disliked Moraz&#x27;s initial choice of chords he played during his guitar solo, causing Moraz to play it differently, which he disagreed with. Yes biographer Dan Hedges compared the track to the style of fusion group Return to Forever.
&quot;To Be Over&quot; originated when Anderson spent an afternoon at Howe&#x27;s house in London. As the two discussed what music to prepare for the album, Anderson told Howe of his fondness for a melody Howe had written and had sung to Anderson before. Anderson also had the initial lyric: &quot;We&#x27;ll go sailing down the stream tomorrow, floating down the universal stream, to be over&quot;. Howe gained inspiration for the track from a boat ride on The Serpentine lake in Hyde Park in London. From the beginning, he thought the song was &quot;really special&quot; and Anderson agreed to develop it further. Howe had come up with the music for this particular section in the late 1960s and took a riff from a track by his earlier group, Tomorrow. Anderson described &quot;To Be Over&quot; as &quot;Strong in content, but mellow in overall attitude ... It&#x27;s about how you should look after yourself when things go wrong.&quot; When the song&#x27;s lyric was being finalised, Howe suggested having the line &quot;She won&#x27;t know what it means to me&quot; follow &quot;We go sailing down the calming streams&quot;, but Anderson changed it to &quot;To be over, we will see&quot;, a change that Howe thought was &quot;creatively disguised&quot; to make a broader lyrical statement. Moraz felt constricted to perform an improvised keyboard solo for the song, so he wrote down a counterpoint solo &quot;exactly like a classical fugue&quot; to blend his keyboards with the guitar and bass. He had written an initial version on paper in an evening, yet the band expressed their wish to change the key of the song for the section, causing Moraz to spend several hours rewriting it overnight.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed and illustrated by English artist Roger Dean, who had designed artwork for the band since 1971, including their logo. In his 1975 book &quot;Views&quot;, Dean picked the cover as his favourite for Yes, and the recording he enjoyed the most. He revealed his intention of depicting &quot;a giant &#x27;gothic&#x27; cave&quot; for the sleeve, &quot;a sort of fortified city for military monks&quot;. The painting originated from a watercolour sketch Dean had done while studying in college. Speaking about the cover in 2004, he said: &quot;I was playing with the ideas of the ultimate castle, the ultimate wall of a fortified city. That was more of a fantastical idea. I was looking for the kinds of things like the Knights Templar would have made or what you&#x27;d see in the current movie &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The curving, swirling cantilevers right into space.&quot; The images depicted in many of Dean&#x27;s album covers set an otherworldly tone and are an identifiable part of the band&#x27;s visual style. For &quot;Relayer&quot;, the warriors on horseback reflect the lyrical themes of war present in &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;. The sleeve includes an untitled four-stanza poem by writer Donald Lehmkuhl dated October 1974, and features a band photograph taken by Moraz&#x27;s former Mainhorse bandmate, Jean Ristori. The album&#x27;s CD reissue features two additional paintings, and further unused designs are included in Dean&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dream&quot;. At the 1975 edition of the NME Awards, the album won Best Dressed LP.

Dean has said that &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; may be his favourite Yes track and that he felt the album should have been named after it. By 2020, the painting had been on sale for $6 million.

==Release==
&quot;Relayer&quot; was released in the UK in November 1974 on LP, audio cassette, and 8-track tape, followed by its release in the US on 5 December 1974. It continued the band&#x27;s commercial success during the 1970s, reaching number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. Less than two weeks after its release in the US, the album reached gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on 18 December 1974 for over 500,000 copies sold. A single of the closing section of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;, titled &quot;Soon&quot; (From &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;), was released as a single on 8 January 1975, with an edited version of &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; on its B-side.

===Reception===
====Critical reception====

&quot;Relayer&quot; received a mostly positive reaction from music critics. Music journalist and author Chris Welch gave a positive review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, praising the album as &quot;one of the most successful and satisfying Yes albums&quot;. He described &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; as a &quot;powerful piece ... and benefits by the time structures imposed by this single album.&quot; Welch continued to note the band &quot;at their best, creating tension and release with consummate ease, and preparing the way for Jon&#x27;s crystalline vocals&quot; at the end of the battle section which segues into &quot;Soon&quot;. In its December 1974 review, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine called &quot;Relayer&quot; &quot;another nearly flawless effort&quot; by Yes and noted Moraz &quot;fits in perfectly&quot;. It concluded with &quot;one of the simpler, yet at the same time, one of the most workable sets the band has come up with.&quot; Those who gave the album a negative review thought it was the follow-up to &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973), an album they felt was pretentious and overblown.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five, stating Yes had &quot;little incentive to curb their musical ambitiousness&quot; at the time, the album &quot;alternated abrasive, rhythmically dense instrumental sections featuring solos for the various instruments with delicate vocal and choral sections featuring poetic lyrics devoted to spiritual imagery.&quot;

====The band====
Howe described the music on &quot;Relayer&quot; as &quot;very modern, European style of music, and Patrick brought in a South American flavour as well. It was a very international record&quot;. Squire thought some of the interaction between his bass and White&#x27;s drums was better than anything heard on previous Yes albums at that point. Moraz summarised the album&#x27;s recording as &quot;pretty loose, but the energy is there&quot;. Upon its release, Wakeman was asked to review it for the BBC and felt pleased that the band had made it as it was &quot;far too jazzy and freeform, which I didn&#x27;t like&quot;. Had the group recorded music more melodic and thematic, he would have felt angry as it would have been the direction that he thought Yes should have adopted. &quot;I&#x27;m pleased I made the right decision to leave the band when I did&quot;.

===Reissues===
&quot;Relayer&quot; was first reissued on CD in 1988 on the Atlantic in Europe and the US. The CD mastering has been attributed to Zal Schreiber, one of Atlantic&#x27;s in-house CD mastering engineers at the time. In 1998, a mini-sleeve HDCD version mastered by Isao Kikuchi was released in Japan . In 2003, the album was digitally remastered on Rhino and Elektra Records by George Marino at Sterling Sound. This version included single edits of &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and a studio run-through of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; with less keyboards and alternate song structures in parts but an identical &quot;battle&quot; section as heard in the final version. 2009 saw the album remastered by Isao Kikuchi for the Japanese market. The 2003 remastered edition was included in the band&#x27;s &quot;The Studio Albums 1969–1987&quot; box set, released in 2013.

In November 2014, &quot;Relayer&quot; was reissued as CD/DVD-Audio and CD/Blu-ray disc packs on the Panegyric label with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson. The packs feature bonus tracks including an original master transfer and studio run-through versions of each track. The Blu-ray pack includes an instrumental mix of the album. This remaster does not include the sound effects heard in the middle section of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; as they were not part of the original multi-track masters. Wilson hypothesised that they were added during the final mixdown of the album from a separate tape source.

==Tour==
Yes supported &quot;Relayer&quot; with their 1974–1975 tour of North America and the UK that lasted from 8 November 1974 to 23 August 1975, with the album played in its entirety. The tour culminated with a headline spot at the 1975 Reading Festival. Most dates featured the English band Gryphon as the opening act. Rehearsals lasted for several weeks at Shepperton Studios, Surrey with Offord on sound, stage lighting by their longtime associate Michael Tait, and the set designed by Roger Dean and his brother Martyn.

The tour opened with a 31-date leg of the US, for which Moraz had about six weeks to familiarise himself with the setlist and made use of his 90-minute drive from his London flat to Squire&#x27;s home to learn it. Ristori assisted by transcribing Yes songs onto paper, forming what Moraz described as &quot;memory sheets&quot;, because of the amount and the complexity of some of his parts. He relied on the sheets for the first few shows on the tour, yet by the time the tour reached Madison Square Garden in New York City less than two weeks later, Moraz realised he had learned the set and stopped using them. The show was a highlight for him: &quot;We had a standing ovation for several minutes. The noise was absolutely unbelievable.&quot; His rig included 14 keyboards on stage, double the number he had previously worked with. Future Yes singer and producer Trevor Horn, a fan of the band, attended their show on the UK leg and recalled the performance of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;: &quot;It got to the end and Jon sang &#x27;Soon&#x27; ... I felt like crying. It got me so much. I loved that song so much&quot;.

Yes originally planned to conduct a European tour in 2020 that continued their Album Series Tour and featured &quot;Relayer&quot; performed in its entirety, but it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was rescheduled for 2022, but the band announced that they would instead dedicate the tour to the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. The &quot;Relayer&quot; tour was subsequently rescheduled a third time for 2023, but was once again postponed due to problems with insurance.

<text>The A1 is a major route in Northern Ireland. It runs from Belfast via Lisburn and Banbridge to the border with the Republic of Ireland south of Newry, from where the road continues to Dublin, becoming the N1 road and M1 motorway. Between Sprucefield and Carrickcarnan the road forms part of the European route E01.

==Recent developments==
The A1 is dual carriageway south from Sprucefield but some junctions remain relatively low specification as they necessitate right-turning movements across the central reservation. The busier junctions have been improved by the provision of bridges or underpasses.

A flyover was constructed at the busy Rathfriland Road junction in Banbridge and an underpass at the very dangerous Hillsborough road junction in Dromore was completed in June 2005.

Improved junctions at Banbridge and Hillsborough opened in September 2009, at Loughbrickland in December 2009 and at Banbridge Road, Dromore in February 2010.

The scheme involving the dualling of the A1 between Beech Hill and Cloghogue was completed in July 2010, five months ahead of schedule.
==Planned developments==
The Roads Service of Northern Ireland has planned to provide four further grade separated junctions. These schemes are located at:
* Listullycurran Road, between Dromore and Hillsborough
* Gowdystown Road, south of Dromore
* Skeltons Road, between Dromore and Banbridge
* Waringsford Road, north of Banbridge.

Further measures envisaged to improve safety include a central reservation safety barrier to be constructed from the A1&#x27;s junction with the M1 at Sprucefield to Loughbrickland. This will involve the closing of many of the dual carriageway&#x27;s central cross-over points.

The Road Service also plan to improve the link between the M1 and A1 at Sprucefield in a scheme that would include a flyover at Hillsborough, replacing the last remaining roundabout on the route between Dublin and Belfast.

<text>The Democratic Women&#x27;s League of Germany (, or DFD) was the mass women&#x27;s organisation in East Germany. It was one of the constituent members of the National Front and sent representatives to the Volkskammer. In 1988, membership was 1.5 million.

The DFD did not have much independence from the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED). Käte Selbmann, a member of the DFD&#x27;s executive board, complained that it was &quot;a pre-school for women, neither as central as the FDGB nor even more important than any other mass organization to women&#x27;s work, and absolutely subordinate to the SED&quot;, while historian Valerie Dubslaff writes that &quot;the role of the department was therefore neither to represent the interests of women nor to promote them within the party, but to execute the political will of its leaders&quot;.

==Organization==

The DFD was established in March 1947 and had the following official aims:

*Removal of fascist ideas
*Education for women
*Equal rights
*Fair social living conditions
*Education of children in the spirit of humanism and peace
*Co-operation with the international women&#x27;s movement

<doc id="336940" wikidata="Q830124" url="?curid=336940" title="Girsanov theorem">
<text>In probability theory, Girsanov&#x27;s theorem or the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov theorem explains how stochastic processes change under changes in measure. The theorem is especially important in the theory of financial mathematics as it explains how to convert from the physical measure, which describes the probability that an underlying instrument (such as a share price or interest rate) will take a particular value or values, to the risk-neutral measure which is a very useful tool for evaluating the value of derivatives on the underlying.

==History==
Results of this type were first proved by Cameron-Martin in the 1940s and by Igor Girsanov in 1960. They have been subsequently extended to more general classes of process culminating in the general form of Lenglart (1977).

==Significance==
Girsanov&#x27;s theorem is important in the general theory of stochastic processes since it enables the key result that if &quot;Q&quot; is a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to &quot;P&quot; then every &quot;P&quot;-semimartingale is a &quot;Q&quot;-semimartingale.

==Statement of theorem==
We state the theorem first for the special case when the underlying stochastic process is a Wiener process. This special case is sufficient for risk-neutral pricing in the Black–Scholes model.

Let formula_1 be a Wiener process on the Wiener probability space formula_2. Let formula_3 be a measurable process adapted to the natural filtration of the Wiener process formula_4; we assume that the usual conditions have been satisfied.

Given an adapted process formula_3 define

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the stochastic exponential of &quot;X&quot; with respect to &quot;W&quot;, i.e.

:formula_8

and formula_9 denotes the quadratic variation of the process &quot;X&quot;.

If formula_10 is a martingale then a probability 
measure &quot;Q&quot; can be defined on formula_11 such that Radon–Nikodym derivative

:formula_12

Then for each &quot;t&quot; the measure &quot;Q&quot; restricted to the unaugmented sigma fields formula_13 is equivalent to &quot;P&quot; restricted to

:formula_14

Furthermore, if formula_15 is a local martingale under &quot;P&quot; then the process

:formula_16

is a &quot;Q&quot; local martingale on the filtered probability space formula_17.

==Corollary==
If &quot;X&quot; is a continuous process and &quot;W&quot; is a Brownian motion under measure &quot;P&quot; then
:formula_18
is a Brownian motion under &quot;Q&quot;.

The fact that formula_19 is continuous is trivial; by Girsanov&#x27;s theorem it is a &quot;Q&quot; local martingale, and by computing

:formula_20

it follows by Levy&#x27;s characterization of Brownian motion that this is a &quot;Q&quot; Brownian
motion.

===Comments===
In many common applications, the process &quot;X&quot; is defined by

:formula_21

For &quot;X&quot; of this form then a necessary and sufficient condition for formula_7 to be a martingale is Novikov&#x27;s condition which requires that

:formula_23

The stochastic exponential formula_7 is the process &quot;Z&quot; which solves the stochastic differential equation

:formula_25

The measure &quot;Q&quot; constructed above is not equivalent to &quot;P&quot; on formula_26 as this would only be the case if the Radon–Nikodym derivative were a uniformly integrable martingale, which the exponential martingale described above is not. On the other hand, as long as Novikov&#x27;s condition is satisfied the measures are equivalent on formula_27.

Additionally, then combining this above observation in this case, we see that the process

formula_28

for formula_29 is a Q Brownian motion. This was Igor Girsanov&#x27;s original formulation of the above theorem.

==Application to finance==
This theorem can be used to show in the Black–Scholes model the unique risk-neutral measure, i.e. the measure in which the fair value of a derivative is the discounted expected value, Q, is specified by

:formula_30

== Application to Langevin equations ==
Another application of this theorem, also given in the original paper of Igor Girsanov, is for stochastic differential equations. Specifically, let us consider the equation

formula_31

where formula_32 denotes a Brownian motion. Here formula_33 and formula_34 are fixed deterministic functions. We assume that this equation has a unique strong solution on formula_35. In this case Girsanov&#x27;s theorem may be used to compute functionals of formula_36 directly in terms a related functional for Brownian motion. More specifically, we have for any bounded functional formula_37 on continuous functions formula_38 that

formula_39

This follows by applying Girsanov&#x27;s theorem, and the above observation, to the martingale process

formula_40

In particular, with the notation above, the process

formula_41

is a Q Brownian motion. Rewriting this in differential form as

formula_42

we see that the law of formula_32 under Q solves the equation defining formula_36, as formula_45 is a Q Brownian motion. In particular, we see that the right-hand side may be written as formula_46, where Q is the measure taken with respect to the process Y, so the result now is just the statement of Girsanov&#x27;s theorem.

A more general form of this application is that if both

formula_47 formula_48

admit unique strong solutions on formula_35, then for any bounded functional on formula_38, we have that

formula_51

<text>Arthur Kenneth Nortje (16 December 1942 – 11 December 1970) was a South African poet.

==Life==
Nortje was born in Oudtshoorn and went to school in Port Elizabeth, where he was taught by the writer Dennis Brutus. After school he studied at the University College of the Western Cape and later received a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford in the UK, where he obtained a BA degree.

He emigrated to Canada in 1967, teaching in Hope, British Columbia and Toronto but returned to Oxford in 1970 to work on a doctorate. He died shortly afterward of a drug overdose. In 2017, South African poet, Athol Williams located Nortje&#x27;s grave at section B3, Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. The small headstone reads &quot;Arthur Nortje, 1942-1970, South African Poet.&quot;

His poems were published posthumously in the collections &quot;Dead Roots&quot; (1973) and &quot;Lonely Against the Light&quot; (1973). They deal extensively with his own personal alienation, being classified as coloured in apartheid South Africa, and his experiences of exile. In 2000, the University of South Africa Press in Pretoria published &quot;Anatomy of Dark: Collected Poems of Arthur Nortje&quot;. His works have been dealt with extensively in Ralph Pordzik&#x27;s &quot;Die moderne englischsprachige Lyrik in Südafrika 1950-1980: Eine Darstellung aus funktions- und wirkungsgeschichtlicher Perspektive&quot; and in an article entitled: &quot;No Longer Need I Shout Freedom in the House: Arthur Nortje, the English Poetical Tradition and the Breakdown of Communication in South African English Poetry in the 1960s&quot;, published in &quot;English Studies in Africa&quot; 41.2 (1998) 35-53.

<doc id="336950" wikidata="Q1465456" url="?curid=336950" title="Visible Human Project">
<text>The Visible Human Project is an effort to create a detailed data set of cross-sectional photographs of the human body, in order to facilitate anatomy visualization applications. It is used as a tool for the progression of medical findings, in which these findings link anatomy to its audiences. A male and a female cadaver were cut into thin slices, which were then photographed and digitized. The project is run by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) under the direction of Michael J. Ackerman. Planning began in 1986; the data set of the male was completed in November 1994 and the one of the female in November 1995. The project can be viewed today at the NLM in Bethesda, Maryland. There are currently efforts to repeat this project with higher resolution images but only with parts of the body instead of a cadaver.

== Data ==

The male cadaver was encased and frozen in a gelatin and water mixture in order to stabilize the specimen for cutting. The specimen was then &quot;cut&quot; in the axial plane at 1-millimeter intervals. Each of the resulting 1,871 &quot;slices&quot; was photographed in both film and digital, yielding 15 gigabytes of data. In 2000, the photos were rescanned at a higher resolution, yielding more than 65 gigabytes. The female cadaver was cut into slices at 0.33-millimeter intervals, resulting in some 40 gigabytes of data.

The term &quot;cut&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, yet it is used to describe the process of grinding away the top surface of a specimen at regular intervals. The term &quot;slice&quot;, also a misnomer, refers to the revealed surface of the specimen to be photographed; the process of grinding the surface away is entirely destructive to the specimen and leaves no usable or preservable &quot;slice&quot; of the cadaver.

The data are supplemented by axial sections of the whole body obtained by computed tomography, axial sections of the head and neck obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and coronal sections of the rest of the body also obtained by MRI.

The scanning, slicing, and photographing took place at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, where additional cutting of anatomical specimens continues to take place.

== Donors ==
The male cadaver is from Joseph Paul Jernigan, a 39-year-old Texas murderer who was executed by lethal injection on August 5, 1993. At the prompting of a prison chaplain he had agreed to donate his body for scientific research or medical use, without knowing about the Visible Human Project. Some people have voiced ethical concerns over this. One of the most notable statements came from the University of Vienna, which demanded that the images be withdrawn with reference to the point that the medical profession should have no association with executions, and that the donor&#x27;s informed consent could be scrutinized.

The 59-year-old female donor remains anonymous. In the press she has been described as a Maryland housewife who died from a heart attack and whose husband requested that she be part of the project.

In 2000, Susan Potter—a cancer patient and a disability rights activist—became the third body donor to the project, spending the 15 following years until her death by pneumonia in 2015 as an outspoken advocate for medical education and a mentor of medical students at the University of Colorado. For nearly two decades, National Geographic documented the story of Susan Potter and Dr. Victor M. Spitzer, the director of the Center for Human Simulation at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus who led the NIH-funded project, releasing a video documentary in 2018. By the time Potter met Spitzer in 2000, she had gone through 26 surgeries and had been diagnosed with melanoma, breast cancer and diabetes: her participation in the Visible Human Project marked a significant departure from the original goals of the project, which up until then had only focused on the dissection and imaging of healthy bodies.

== Problems with the data sets ==
Freezing caused the brain of the man to be slightly swollen, and his middle ear ossicles were lost during preparation of the slices. Nerves are hard to make out since they have almost the same color as fat, but many have nevertheless been identified. Small blood vessels were collapsed by the freezing process. Tendons are difficult to cut cleanly, and they occasionally smear across the slice surfaces.

The male has only one testicle, is missing his appendix, and has tissue deterioration at the site of lethal injection. Also visible are tissue damage to the dorsum of each forearm by formalin injection and damage to the right sartorius from opening the right femoral vein for drainage. The male was also not &quot;cut&quot; while in standard anatomical position, so the cuts through his arms are oblique. The female was missing 14 body parts, including nose cartilage.

The reproductive organs of the woman are not representative of those of a young woman. The specimen contains several pathologies, including cardiovascular disease and diverticulitis.

== Discoveries ==
By studying the data set, researchers at Columbia University found several errors in anatomy textbooks related to males, regarding the shape of a muscle in the pelvic region and the location of the urinary bladder and prostate.

== License ==
The data may be bought on tape or downloaded free of charge; Currently no license agreement is required to access or download the dataset, however general terms and conditions apply requiring acknowledgement of the National Library of Medicine with any use. Prior to 2019, one had to specify the intended use and sign a license agreement that allows NLM to use and modify the resulting application. NLM can cancel the agreement at any time, at which point the user has to erase the data files.

== Applications using the data ==

Various projects to make the raw data more useful for educational purposes are under way. It is necessary to build a three-dimensional virtual model of the body where the organs are labeled, may be removed selectively and viewed from all sides, and ideally are even animated. Two commercial software products accomplish the majority of these goals, the VH Dissector from Touch of Life Technologies and from Voxel-Man the VOXEL-MAN 3D Navigator Inner Organs - now freely downloadable. NLM itself has started an open source project, the Insight Toolkit, whose aim is to automatically deduce organ boundaries from the data.

The data were used for Alexander Tsiaras&#x27;s book and CD-ROM &quot;Body Voyage&quot;, which features a three-dimensional tour through the body.

A &quot;Virtual Radiography&quot; application creates Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs and &quot;virtual surgery&quot;, where endoscopic procedures or balloon angioplasty are simulated: the surgeon can view the progress of the instrument on a screen and receives realistic tactile feedback according to what kind of tissue the instrument would currently be touching.

Several other educational applications utilized form the visible human project include: multiple interactive anatomy computer software programs (Primal Pictures/Anatomy.tv, Anatomage), multimodality image restoration for hospital patients, body system relationships, and volumetric data.

The male data set was used in &quot;Project 12:31&quot;, a series of photographic light paintings by Croix Gagnon and Frank Schott, and is the male Caucasian cadaver on the Anatomage Table 6.0 application.

<text>The A2 is a major road in south-east England, connecting London with the English Channel port of Dover in Kent. This route has always been of importance as a connection between London and sea trade routes to Continental Europe. It was originally known as the Dover Road. The M2 motorway has replaced part of the A2 as the strategic route.

Unlike the other single digit A-roads in Great Britain, the A2 does not form a zone boundary. The boundary between Zones 1 and 2 is the River Thames.

==History of the route==
The route of the current A2 follows a similar route to that of a Celtic ancient trackway. It was an important route for the Romans linking London with Canterbury and the three Channel ports of Rutupiae (now Richborough), Dubris (now Dover) and Portus Lemanis (in modern Lympne). It had river crossings at Rochester over the River Medway; Dartford (River Darent) and Crayford (River Cray). The Romans paved the road and constructed the first Rochester Bridge across the Medway. Access to London was via London Bridge which was first constructed by the Romans in AD 50. The road appeared in the Antonine Itinerary, a contemporary map of Roman roads in Britain, as &#x27;Item a Londinio ad portum Dubris&#x27;.

In Anglo-Saxon times it became part of a longer road known as Wæcelinga Stræt (&#x27;Watling Street&#x27; in modern English). Rochester Bridge was rebuilt in stone in 1391 and the &#x27;Wardens and Commonalty of Rochester Bridge&#x27; were created to maintain the bridge, the modern equivalent of which, the Rochester Bridge Trust, still manages the current crossing.

By the 17th century, the road had fallen into disrepair and sections were converted into turnpike roads by various Turnpike Acts passed by Parliament. The section between Gravesend and Rochester was turnpiked in 1712 and that from Chatham to Canterbury in 1730; the section from there to Dover was only turnpiked in the 19th century by which time it was known as the Great Dover Road. Rochester Bridge was rebuilt in cast iron in 1856 (and rebuilt again in 1914 with a second bridge in 1970). The London, Chatham and Dover Railway completed a railway route from London to Dover in the 1860s. Access to London from the A2 across the River Thames was improved with the completion of Tower Bridge (1894), Blackwall Tunnel (1897) and the Rotherhithe Tunnel (1908).

The road was given the reference A2 within the Great Britain road numbering scheme in the 1920s. The Dartford Southern By-pass, which relieved chronic congestion on the old route through Dartford, provided considerable local employment during the Post–World War I recession. It was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1924 and is now named Princes Road. It is estimated that the project provided 63,500 days work to local unemployed people.

The Dartford Crossing opened as a single tunnel in 1963, then a second tunnel opened in 1980 for additional traffic on the A2, and the M2 Motorway opened in stages between 1963 and 1965 providing an alternative faster route for long-distance traffic avoiding the A2 through Rochester and Chatham. The three-lane stretch of the A2 between Falconwood and Cobham was built in stages from around 1963 until 1973. A section of Ringway 3 (part of the proposed M16 motorway linking to the A2, which later formed part of the M25 motorway opened between 1974 and 1977.

The Strood to Swanscombe dualling was constructed from 1 June 1964, being seven miles, with a contract of £4,436,869 given to A. Monk Ltd of Padgate, near Warrington. The dualled section replaced a single-carriageway three-lane road. It was a dualled three-lane section, with hard shoulders (hardened verge), with four grade-separated junctions. It was to finish in the summer of 1966. Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son constructed the bridges. The section was opened at noon on Friday 29 July 1966, with the Bishop of Rochester, David Say, who said a prayer, and George Harris, the managing director of Monk Ltd.

The Rochester Way Relief Road, bypassing Kidbrooke and Eltham, was opened in 1988. The M20 motorway to Folkestone was constructed in stages from the 1960s and provided a faster route to Dover following extensions built in the early 1990s, after which traffic levels on the M2 and A2 reduced. The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge opened in 1991.

A new flyover for A2 westbound to M25 northbound traffic was completed in late 2007.

In 2008, a section of the A2 beside Gravesend was widened to 3 or 4 lanes between Pepperhill (a suburb of Northfleet) to Cobham. It was also rerouted away from the houses of Gravesend/Singlewell to make room for the new lanes and reduce the amount of noise and pollution from the widened roads. The old route of the A2 (the Roman road) has been made into a combined footpath and cycle path. The new road section opened in 2009. A section of the old road has been turned into Cyclopark, with footpaths, cycle paths and an equestrian route along the old road.

==Proposed developments==
A new Lower Thames Crossing down river from the Dartford Crossing linking to the A2 has been proposed by the Department for Transport in 2009.

==The route today==
Its original alignment roughly followed a mix of the ancient Celtic route and the turnpike road to Dover. The Roman alignment, however, is not easy to identify and much of the original A2 does not exactly follow what is known of the Roman route (the straightness of many long stretches is misleading). A section of the modern A2 from Rochester to the Roman settlement of &quot;Vagniacae&quot;, modern Springhead, is believed to roughly follow the Roman route.

===Borough to Shooter&#x27;s Hill===

The A2 starts at Borough in Central London, at a junction with the A3, near the church of St George the Martyr. The remains of a small Roman temple was excavated at Tabard Square in 2003. The A2 at this point is named Great Dover Street, and is the only part of the A2 within the congestion charging zone. At the end of the road, it meets the London Inner Ring Road and becomes a primary route. The A2 heads along Old Kent Road towards New Cross, where the A20 breaks away. The A2 continues east through Deptford and Blackheath until it arrives at the Shooter&#x27;s Hill Interchange with the A102 near Greenwich. A section of the Roman road has been identified running through Greenwich Park on an alignment with Vanbrugh Park.

===Shooter&#x27;s Hill to Three Crutches===

At Shooter&#x27;s Hill, Watling Street and the A2 part company, as Watling Street continues along the A207. At this point the A2 joins a dual carriageway, the Rochester Way Relief Road (the carriageways to the north of this junction being the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Approach) with a speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h).

The A2 meets traffic lights at Kidbrooke; this is the last set of traffic lights out of Greater London (the lights only apply to traffic turning right onto the A2213). Shortly after here, the A2 crosses the A205 South Circular Road and becomes a motorway in all but name, with 3 lanes and a hard shoulder in each direction. Within the London section the left hand lane is used for local traffic.
At Falconwood, the road becomes the East Rochester Way – this point was once the westbound terminus of the dual carriageway. There are exits for Bexleyheath, Black Prince (at Bexley), and other south east London suburbs. Motorists should be aware that the section between the Blackwall Tunnel Approach and Dartford Heath is monitored using average speed cameras. Just before the A2 reaches the junction with the A2018, the speed limit increases to the national speed limit (70 mph, 112 km/h) as the road crosses the Greater London boundary to head eastwards into Kent towards Dartford, bypassing the town to the south and cutting through Dartford Heath. The next junction links the road to the M25 London Orbital Motorway at Dartford; the next, (Bean Interchange), is for the B255 and A296 for Bluewater, where Watling Street rejoins the A2.

The A2 then bypasses Gravesend, before merging into the M2 at Three Crutches Interchange, near Strood.

This latter section, from the Pepper Hill Interchange (near Northfleet and the Ebbsfleet International railway station), to the Cobham Interchange underwent extensive works (2007–2009) to move the entire carriageway south to run parallel to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, so as to move the road away from residential housing – and continue using four lanes in each direction, with grade separated junctions.

===Three Crutches to Brenley Corner===

The A2 reverts to a non-primary single carriageway road at this point. The M2 now parts company to bypass the Medway Towns, while the A2 heads into them. It enters Strood before crossing the River Medway into Rochester. The A2 bypasses the old High Street, heading instead along Corporation Street alongside the railway lines. It crosses the old High Street, climbs Star Hill and heads east into Chatham where it meets the A230 and A231. There used to be one way ring road but it was changed to two way running in 2006 and was partially closed to all but buses and taxis in 2009, meaning the ring road was no more. The A2 heads to the south of Gillingham, where the A289 Medway Northern Bypass joins it. The A278 departs from the A2 to head south to meet the M2, whereas the A2 goes through Rainham and Newington before entering green country for the first time since Three Crutches.

The road meets the A249, now dualled, to the west of Sittingbourne, before going through the town itself (bypassing the now-pedestrianised High Street, as it does in Rochester and Chatham). Leaving Sittingbourne, the A2 continues east in an almost straight line, for it is still along the alignment of Watling Street at this point. At Ospringe it passes the Maison Dieu, now a museum of Roman artifacts but originally a wayside hospital commissioned by Henry III in 1234. The A2 continues to Faversham, but does not (and never has) go through the town, but almost bypasses it to the south. A mile (1.6 km) later, it arrives at Brenley Corner, junction 7 of the M2.

===Brenley Corner To Dover Docks===
At Brenley Corner, the A2 once again becomes a primary dual carriageway. Straight after the interchange, Dunkirk and Boughton are bypassed as the A2 continues towards Canterbury and Dover. Formerly it went through Canterbury city centre, this has now been bypassed and the original route is now called the A2050. It breaks off from the A2 at Harbledown – just after Gate Services – taking all Canterbury traffic with it. At Wincheap, the A28 meets the A2, although only westbound traffic can exit the A2 at this point. The A2050 rejoins the A2 at Bridge.

Traffic for the Channel Tunnel and Folkestone leaves at the junction with the A260, and shortly after this junction the A2 loses its dual carriageway status, regains it, and loses it again within a few miles. The A2 formerly ran through Lydden but was diverted in 1977. Now single carriageway, the A2 forms the Dover bypass. It meets the A256 for Sandwich and Ramsgate at a briefly dualled section, before reverting to single carriageway for the final time. The A2 breaks through the cliffs above Dover Docks before turning 180 degrees by way of a pigtail bridge and &quot;touching down&quot; on land again at the entrance to the Eastern Docks, where both it and the A20 terminate.

<text>The A4 is a major road in England from Central London to Avonmouth via Heathrow Airport, Reading, Bath and Bristol. It is historically known as the Bath Road with newer sections including the Great West Road and Portway. The road was once the main route from London to Bath, Bristol and the west of England and formed, after the A40, the second main western artery from London.

Although most traffic is carried by the M4 motorway today, the A4 still acts as the main route from Bristol to London for non-motorway traffic.

==History==

===Turnpikes===
The A4 has gone through many transformations through the ages from pre-Roman routes, Roman roads (such as the one passing Silbury Hill), and basic wagon tracks. During the Middle Ages, most byways and tracks served to connect villages with their nearest market town. A survey of Savernake Forest near Hungerford in 1228 mentions &quot;The King&#x27;s Street&quot; running between the town and Marlborough. This street corresponded roughly with the route of the modern A4. In 1632, Thomas Witherings was appointed Postmaster of Foreign Mails by Charles I. Three years later, the king charged him with building six &quot;Great Roads&quot; to aid in the delivery of the post, of which the Great West Road was one.

It was not until the 17th century that a distinct route between London and Bristol started to resemble today&#x27;s road. During the 17th century, the A4 was known as the Great Road to Bristol. When Queen Anne started patronising the spa city of Bath, the road became more commonly known as Bath Road. Over the years, the direction of the road has taken many detours depending on such factors as changes in tolls or turnpike patronage. For example, in 1750 the toll road from London was altered to go through Melksham; and in 1695 the map maker, John Ogilby, produced a map of the Hungerford area of the Great West Road showing two possible routes.

As Bath became more popular with the wealthy and famous, it was inevitable that turnpike trusts would be set up under the terms of the Turnpike Acts to pay for maintenance and improvements to the road. The first turnpike on this road was between Reading and Theale in 1714. Due to increasing traffic, sections of the road between Kensington, over Hounslow Hill, to Twyford were turnpike by 1717 with the remaining sections placed under turnpike trusts.

As turnpike trusts were individually run, there was the possibility for greatly differing road conditions, especially over the London Clay basin of Kensington, Brentford, Hounslow and Slough, where winter conditions left the way muddy and uneven. This was not always the case with the Bath Road, as many of the wealthy landowners along the route co-operated informally and exercised a large amount of control over feeder roads. As a result, control of the Bath Road was easy to maintain and many inns and towns became prosperous.

Tollhouses were established at Colnbrook, Maidenhead, Twyford, Castle Street Reading, Thatcham and Benham. During the 1820s, the employment of good surveyors improved the condition of the road and aided an increased flow of wealthy travellers. The tolls raised from such clientele ensured that when the turnpike trusts handed over the route to local highway boards, they had no financial liabilities. Justices of the peace were empowered by the Highway Act 1862 to combine turnpike trusts into highways districts. This meant that by the late 1860s trusts were either not renewing their powers or were being terminated by general Acts of Parliament. For example, most turnpikes in Berkshire, including the Bath Road, were officially wound up by 1878 when legislation transferred responsibility for dis-enturnpiked roads to the new county councils. The tollgate on the Bath Road west of Reading was removed in 1864 as the outward pressure of urban development made rates a more acceptable way of financing the maintenance of what was now a suburban road.

===Postal service and coaching===
With the improvement being made to the road systems, the business of moving mail became easier and thus more profitable as volumes were able to increase. In Bristol, a postal office had been well established by the 1670s. The journey time to London at this period was about 16 and three quarter hours. A letter from Bath in 1684 took about 3 days going via a postal office in Marshfield on the Bristol Road. (The route to Bristol did not yet go through Bath at this time). Journey times during the Turnpike era fell with the improvements from 2 days in 1752 to 38 hours in 1782 and 18 hours by 1836. Royal Mail coaches in 1836 were able to do the trip in 12 to 13 hours.

Further improvements to regional post services were made between 1719 and 1763 due to contracts with the London Inland Letter Office negotiated by Ralph Allen, the postmaster of Bath.

In the early part of the 19th century, coaching was at its height with six stagecoaches each day carrying passengers to and from London along the Bath Road in 1830, rising to ten by 1836. Hungerford is at about the midway point of the journey between London and Bristol and was ideally positioned to take advantage of the increase in coaching. In 1836, five companies operated a coaching service through Hungerford. This peak was to be short-lived following the construction of the Great Western Railway. The decline in coaching traffic in Hungerford coincided with the building of the Great Western Railway from London to Bath and Bristol, and the subsequent Berks and Hants Railway line from Newbury to Hungerford itself in 1847. By 1843, it was reported that the stage coaches had ceased running between Bristol and London.

==Route==

===Holborn Circus to Westminster (0.4 miles)===

The A4 begins as New Fetter Lane in the City of London at Holborn Circus on the A40. It goes in a southerly direction to join Fleet Street where many British national newspapers at one time had their head offices.

===Westminster to Hammersmith via Kensington (4.6 miles)===
The road heads west through the City of Westminster via Aldwych and the Strand, passing notable landmarks such as the Royal Courts of Justice, the Savoy and Adelphi theatres, and Charing Cross railway station.

From Charing Cross station to Green Park, the westbound and eastbound routes of the A4 are considerably different, due to one-way systems. Westbound, the A4 continues along the Strand up to Charing Cross itself, then along Cockspur Street and into Pall Mall, the location of many exclusive gentlemen&#x27;s clubs as well as the Institute of Directors, before turning right along St James&#x27;s Street to reach Piccadilly.

Eastbound from Green Park, the A4 runs along the full length of Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus, before turning right along Haymarket. It bears left along Pall Mall East, then right along the west side of Trafalgar Square, past the National Gallery and Canada House, to Charing Cross. Finally, it bears left along the east side of the Square, past South Africa House, then right along Duncannon Street to reach Charing Cross station.

The first part of Regent Street, from Waterloo Place to Piccadilly Circus, is also signed as the A4; all traffic here runs in a northbound direction.
From Green Park, the A4 enters a short tunnel under Hyde Park Corner, where Wellington Arch is located. Afterwards, the road continues along the first part of Knightsbridge, before bearing left onto Brompton Road. This is an affluent area of London, in which the Harrods and Harvey Nichols department stores are located as well as numerous embassies. At this point, the road enters the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

At the Brompton Oratory, the road bears right along Thurloe Place and Cromwell Gardens, past the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Ismaili Centre, and onto Cromwell Road, past the Natural History Museum. At Earls Court, the A4 becomes dual carriageway, and continues along West Cromwell Road, over the West London Line into West Kensington and the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

A section of the road from Knightsbridge to the Chiswick Flyover was the first section of Clearway designated in London. It introduced no stopping on the road during rush hours on 21 August 1961.

===Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport (10.7 miles)===

The A4 continues along Talgarth Road past the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. The road becomes elevated at the Hammersmith Flyover and heads towards Heathrow Airport as the Great West Road, passing Hammersmith&#x27;s two churches of St Paul and St Peter. At this point the road is close to the River Thames.

The road enters Chiswick and the Borough of Hounslow, passing Fuller&#x27;s Brewery. After Hogarth Roundabout, the road passes Hogarth&#x27;s House and is called Hogarth Lane, then Ellesmere Road and Cedars Road. It becomes the Great West Road again just a few yards short of the start of Chiswick Flyover, which is junction 1 of the M4. Gunnersbury&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Cathedral is clearly visible on the right.

The next major intersection is Chiswick Roundabout, which is the junction for both the North and South Circular Roads. The road then passes the Glaxo-Smith Kline premises in Brentford where it follows underneath its successor the M4 as far as the bridge over the River Brent. The stretch between Chiswick&#x27;s western border to Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) is known as the Golden Mile with some notable Art Deco factories. The road remains as the Great West Road through Osterley and Hounslow where it splits with the A30, which is known as the Great South West Road. Between the two world wars, the Great West Road was built as a bypass to relieve traffic congestion in Brentford and Hounslow.

After the A30, the A4 changes its name to Bath Road, enters Cranford, and crosses the River Crane into the Borough of Hillingdon. It then passes along the northern boundary of Heathrow Airport, before leaving the London suburbs over the M25 towards the west.

===Heathrow Airport to Slough (6.7 miles)===

After leaving Heathrow Airport, still the A4, it becomes the Colnbrook Bypass and climbs over the M25 motorway. This bypass for the narrow main road of Colnbrook was built after the Second World War across farmland between Harmondsworth and the outskirts of Langley.

The next major intersection is junction 5 of the M4 (Slough-East) known as the Langley junction. At this point the A4 loses its trunk road classification.

Continuing towards Slough town centre, the road, now named London Road, passes Kedermister Park on the right. Changing into Sussex Place, the architecturally impressive St Bernard&#x27;s former convent is on the right. Becoming the dual carriageway Wellington Street (a late 1960s bypass for the High Street), Tesco&#x27;s massive &quot;aircraft hangar&quot; supermarket is on the right and the Queensmere and Observatory Shopping Centres on the left.

The end of this section of the Great Western Road is in the centre of Slough at the junction of William Street and Wellington Street. This spot was formerly the site of Slough&#x27;s largest roundabout on the south-east corner of Thames Valley University. Nearby is Slough railway station, served by Great Western Railway.

The roundabout was removed in 2011 and the university&#x27;s Slough campus closed in 2011 after planning permission was granted for 1,598 flats.

===Slough to Maidenhead (6.0 miles)===

Continuing from the William Street / Wellington Street junction, in the centre of Slough, the road heads westwards towards Maidenhead. The short stretch of dual carriageway is Wellington Street, then briefly on the most western end of the High Street, over the railway bridge for the line between Slough and Windsor Central Station.

The Bath Road begins on the west side of the bridge. On the left is Slough&#x27;s 1936 Town Hall, now abandoned by the local council, and on the right Salt Hill Park.

The next major road intersection is by the Three Tuns Pub where the A4 crosses the A355. This road goes north towards Farnham Royal, Farnham Common, Beaconsfield and the M40 at junction 2. To the south, it goes towards the M4 (junction 6, Slough Centre) and Windsor.

The route at this point runs parallel to both the Great Western Main Line and the M4. The road continues past the southern fringe of Slough Trading Estate.
On Slough&#x27;s western boundary is the Huntercombe Spur roundabout linking the A4 to junction 7 of the M4 motorway. Here the dual carriageway ends. The road bends right at Taplow and passes under a high railway bridge, then over the River Thames flood prevention channel.

The road then goes over Maidenhead&#x27;s old bridge Maidenhead Bridge, spanning the River Thames, and into the eastern outskirts of Maidenhead.

Along Bridge Road, St Cloud Way and Bad Godesberg Way respectively. The centre of Maidenhead is reached at the roundabout that forms the junction with the A308. Turning northwards on the A308 would lead to the A404 towards Marlow and High Wycombe. Southwards, the A308 heads towards Windsor and provides an opportunity to branch off for junction 8/9 of the M4.

===Maidenhead to Reading (12.3 miles)===
Heading out of Maidenhead town centre, the road follows Castle Hill and then Bath Road. At the outskirts, the road forms part of junction 9b of the A404(M)/A404, which links junction 8/9 of the M4 with junction 4 of the M40 at Handy Cross. The A4 crosses open countryside before following New Bath Road on the outskirts of Twyford. This is a bypass, built in 1929, that deviates from the old route of the A4, and crosses the River Loddon on its way into the suburbs of Reading via the village of Charvil.

The A4 passes the King George&#x27;s Field in Sonning, which are used as playing fields, and the Reading Cricket and Hockey Club. As it enters Reading, along the London Road again, it crosses the junction of the A3290 next to Palmer Park, which leads to Junction 10 of the M4.
The A4 goes over the intersection with the A329 Cemetery Junction which links Wokingham with Pangbourne, passing the Royal Berkshire Hospital and the London Road Campus of the University of Reading. At London Street and again at Southampton Street, the A4 meets the A327 twice, since the latter loops round on two branches which meet at Whitley Street. Between the two junctions, the A4 becomes Crown Street for approximately 150 metres.

===Reading to Newbury (16.7 miles)===
On the other side of the intersection the A4 follows Pell Street and continues westward. Here it crosses the River Kennet, the Holy Brook and the A33 relief road, which goes towards Basingstoke. In West Reading, the A4 becomes Berkeley Avenue, and then the Bath Road. It passes Prospect Park, and the suburbs of Southcote, Horncastle and Calcot, before reaching Junction 12 of the M4. The A4 heads south westerly through Theale and over the roundabout connecting it to the A340 which heads towards Pangbourne.

Heading towards Thatcham, the road passes Aldermaston Wharf next to the Kennet and Avon Canal and through the villages of Woolhampton and Midgham. A large industrial estate is on the left as the road enters Thatcham. At the roundabout after the industrial Estate the route follows London Road and passes Thatcham towards Benham Hill and Newbury. At the Benham Hill roundabout it goes along Bath Road where it deviates from Turnpike Road. Bath Road is the original turnpiked road and the road now confusingly called Turnpike Road was originally called The Shaw Road. The turnpike then continues along London Road as it enters the outskirts of Newbury.

Heading towards the centre of Newbury, the route passes the West Berkshire Community Hospital on the right. To the North of the town centre the road becomes part of an unusual junction with the A339 that links the new A34 by-pass to the north with Basingstoke to the south. The junction is a combination of a figure of eight roundabout with an elevated section that used to be the old route of the A34.

===Newbury to Marlborough (18.8 miles)===

After the junction, the road heads out of town through Speenhamland along Western Avenue and Bath Road to the junction with the A34 Newbury bypass, which was opened, after some controversy, on 17 November 1998, at a cost of £104 million. The route heads over undulating countryside in a fairly straight westward direction towards Hungerford, parallel to the Kennet and Avon Canal and crossing the River Kennet on the outskirts of the town at the same time as intersecting with the A338. The route does not enter the town centre, but continues through the northern part of town on its way to Marlborough, via the village of Froxfield and the northern edge of Savernake Forest.

On entering the outskirts of Marlborough the road follows London Road. Crossing the River Kennet again it briefly shares the highway with the A346 which connects northwards to Swindon. It splits again at a roundabout along New Road and Oxford Street into the town centre on the High Street. The High Street is a traditional main thoroughfare for an English market town, in that it is wide, with space for market stalls on either side and in the middle, though these spaces are usually marked for car parking.

Until the late 1980s most of this section, and some of the following Wiltshire section, was configured as three lanes, with the central lane available for overtaking traffic in either direction. This is no longer considered safe so the road now has one wider-than-normal lane in each direction, with ghost islands at junctions to discourage overtaking at these points.

===Marlborough to Chippenham (18.9 miles)===

The A4 continues along the High Street on its way out of Marlborough via Bridewell Street and Bath Road. The road passes underneath a covered bridge that links Morris House of Marlborough College to the North Block of the same establishment. The college is an independent boarding school established in 1843 using some of the buildings that remained after the demise of the coaching trade, which saw the original Castle Inn Coaching House close.

The route continues westward through the village of Fyfield, across Overton Hill where there is a parking area at the start of the Ridgeway National Trail and through the village of West Kennett. On leaving West Kennett there are some lay-bys where visitors can walk a short distance from the road to the Neolithic West Kennet Long Barrow, which forms part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. One mile further along the A4 is Silbury Hill, which is also part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. A purpose built car park is located beyond the hill on the right travelling westward. As the route approaches the Beckhampton roundabout, which forms the intersection with the A361, it passes by the Waggon &amp; Horses Inn, built in 1669 to profit from the increasing trade along the old Bath Road. It is mentioned in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; by Charles Dickens.
The route continues past Cherhill. The Cherhill White Horse can be seen to the left, and nearby the Lansdowne Monument. The route then descends the Labour in Vain Hill through the village of Quemerford and into the market town of Calne. Heading towards the town centre, the road crosses a double mini roundabout, one exit forming the junction with the A3102 to Melksham. It follows New Road and passes by the old coaching inn of the Lansdowne Strand. On the way out of Calne, the road goes along Curzon Street, and then to Chilvester Hill at the roundabout where the northern part of the A3102 splits off towards Lyneham.

The A4 descends steeply before climbing again up Black Dog Hill past the Bowood House Estate. The old road used to pass through Derry Hill, but the New Road, as it is called at this point, indicates that the village was bypassed. There follows a steep descent to the junction with the A342 Devizes road and a right turn past the Lysley Arms towards Chippenham.

On the outskirts of Chippenham is a large roundabout, where the A4 used to carry straight on down London Road and The Causeway into the town centre, which has since been pedestrianised. Most traffic turns left to go round the Pewsham Estate relief road called Pewsham Way, which is now the classified A4 route. After four roundabouts, the A4 turns left in a southerly direction at another roundabout. The route heads downhill over the River Avon on the Avenue La Fleche, named after one of Chippenham&#x27;s twin towns, to the Bridge Centre roundabout.

===Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)===

The Bridge Centre roundabout forms a junction of the A4 with the A420 Bristol Road. The route heads over Rowden Hill past the Chippenham Community Hospital and down to the spot where musician Eddie Cochran was killed in a car crash on 17 April 1960. A plaque has been placed there in remembrance.

From there it passes under the railway arch built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the 1830s and on to its junction with the A350. From this point onwards it regains its trunk road status and heads up Chequers Hill towards Corsham. The road passes through Pickwick, which used to be a village in its own right. Charles Dickens stayed at the Hare &amp; Hounds Inn and used the village name for the title of his novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

After a series of roundabouts the A4 continues uphill, past what used to be the Ministry of Defence Naval Operations site at Copenacre (now a housing development) before descending steeply to the village of Box. From the road the Box Tunnel, built as part of the Great Western Railway, can be seen clearly. The road bears to the right at the junction with the A365 to Melksham, and criss-crosses with the main railway line as far as the roundabout at Bathford which forms a junction with the A363 towards Bradford-on-Avon. The road after this roundabout becomes a dual carriageway until the A4 diverts to the left down a slip road, and the remainder becomes the A46; this section, the £45 million dual-carriageway Batheaston/Swainswick Bypass, opened in summer 1996, was highly controversial both at planning and at construction stages.

The route enters the outskirts of Bath passing by the training grounds of Bath RFC. After a series of traffic light controlled junctions, the A4 continues straight ahead where it meets the A36. It passes Hedgemead Park and down The Paragon before crossing into George Street and to Queen Square.

===Bath to Bristol/Avonmouth (19.6 miles)===

In the original 1922 road numbering list, the A4 ended at the junction between George Street and Milsom Street in Bath. On 1 April 1935, it was extended over the A431 and B4044 to Newbridge, and the A36 to Avonmouth.

From Queen Square, Bath, the A4 carries on to Queen Square Place and Charlotte Street, before heading along the Upper Bristol Road by Royal Victoria Park to Newbridge Road. The road crosses the River Avon on its way to join the A36 and becomes a dual carriageway again until the roundabout that forms the junction with the A39 Wells Road at the Globe Inn and exit for the nearby Bath Spa University. It continues on through the village of Saltford towards Keynsham where a roundabout splits the road and the A4 continues as a dual carriageway by-passing the town, crossing over the River Chew in the process.

The end of the by-pass coincides with the junction of the Avon Ring Road, the A4174. The route goes through the suburb of Brislington, going past Arnos Court Park and Arnos Vale Cemetery. The road runs over a bridge over the New Cut and into Temple Gate where Bristol Temple Meads railway station is located. The A4 no longer has a defined route from this point to the start of Anchor Road at The Centre; originally it went along Victoria Street and Baldwin Street before turning left onto St Augustine&#x27;s Parade or, later, Broad Quay, but in more recent times it followed Redcliffe Way, via Redcliffe Roundabout (junction with the A38) across Queen Square to The Centre. From there it turns back towards Bristol Harbour via Anchor Road past the We The Curious science museum. After another roundabout the A4 follows along Hotwell Road and around a one-way system that merges the A4 with the A3029.

At this point the A4 regains trunk road classification and passes under the Clifton Suspension Bridge along the Portway. It heads out of the city into the suburbs of Sea Mills and Shirehampton before going under the M5 to end at the roundabout that feeds the motorway, the M49 and A403 in Avonmouth.

<doc id="336957" wikidata="Q67649265" url="?curid=336957" title="Fingerpaint">
<text>Fingerpaint is a kind of paint intended to be applied with the fingers; it typically comes in tubes and is used by small children, though it has occasionally been used by adults either to teach art to children, or for their own use.

==Finger paint for education and therapy==
American educator Ruth Faison Shaw is credited with introducing fingerpainting as an art education medium. She developed her techniques in Rome, Italy, before patenting a safe non-toxic paint in 1931. After developing her expressive medium for children, Shaw devoted her attention to its therapeutic benefits. At the request of Carl Menninger, she taught at the Southard School at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, United States. Later she served as a consultant to the Department of Psychiatry at Memorial Hospital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While working at Memorial Hospital, she met psychologist, John Thomas Payne. Payne became her successor in 1969 and continued her work until his death in 2000.

Today Shaw and Payne&#x27;s work continues at the Shaw School and Studio in Durham, NC. Founder and director, Bryan Carey apprenticed with Payne from 1986 to 1993. At the suggestion of Payne, Carey devoted an additional seven years to the study of Shaw as an historical figure—artist, teacher and therapist. Carey and his protégée Jennifer Falchi continue the Shaw-Payne tradition by traveling and teaching their method of artistic self-expression and emotional healing to people of all ages and abilities.

== Technique ==
Although the name implies that the paint is applied with the fingers, expert use of this medium makes use of the hands and lower arms too. Use of the entire arm smooths the paint on the paper prior to more detailed modeling with the fingers and other parts of the hand. Sometimes sponges, cloth, and other tools are used to obtain a specific texture.

Some artists are known to solely paint with their hands, as a way to become more intimate with the process. These artists do not use traditional fingerpaint. This style, &quot;Reckless Art&quot;, is most accurately categorized as a subgenre of outsider art. Painters like Tyler Ramsey have vowed never to touch a brush, but the use of surgical gloves for safety is common when using toxic oils. Tyler Ramsey claims that, &quot;Rejecting brushes gives a painter the opportunity to approach the craft from a fresh perspective.&quot; &quot;Reckless Art&quot; started in 2002 as a way to refute the idea that &quot;Everything has been done already.&quot;

Finger painting artist Nick Benjamin claims he &quot;prefers to paint using fingers as the technique results in a real bond between the artwork and artist and allows for some intricate blending not achievable with brushes&quot;. 

Another popular finger painting artist is Iris Scott, who only uses her hands because she follows her intuition.

Outsider artist Jimmy Lee Sudduth explained that he painted with his fingers because they &quot;never wore out&quot; the way brushes did.

Fingerpaint treated repeatedly by means of decalcomania on the same paper tends to generate fractals, as studied at Yale University.

== Materials ==
Fingerpaint is non-toxic and is usually sold in packages of six bright colors. The paints can also be prepared from non-toxic household products such as flour or cornstarch.

Some childcare facilities use instant pudding as fingerpaint, eliminating the need to keep the children&#x27;s fingers out of their mouths.

<doc id="336959" wikidata="Q84232" url="?curid=336959" title="Veronica Lake">
<text>Constance Frances Marie Ockelman (November 14, 1922 – July 7, 1973), known professionally as Veronica Lake, was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake was best known for her femme fatale roles in films noir with Alan Ladd during the 1940s, her peek-a-boo hairstyle, and films such as &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941) and &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942). By the late 1940s, Lake&#x27;s career began to decline, due in part to her alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s, but had several guest appearances on television. She returned to the big screen in the film &quot;Footsteps in the Snow&quot; (1966), but the role failed to revitalize her career.

Lake&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake&quot;, was published in 1970. Her final screen role was in a low-budget horror film, &quot;Flesh Feast&quot; (1970). After years of heavy drinking, Lake died at the age of 50 in July 1973, from hepatitis and acute kidney injury.

==Early life==
Lake was born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Her father, Harry Eugene Ockelman, was of German and Irish descent, and worked for an oil company aboard a ship. He died in an oil tanker explosion in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania in 1932. Lake&#x27;s mother, Constance Frances Charlotta (née Trimble; 1902–1992), of Irish descent, in 1933 married Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist also of Irish descent, and Lake began using his surname.

The Keanes lived in Saranac Lake, New York, where young Lake attended St. Bernard&#x27;s School. She was then sent to Villa Maria, an all-girls Catholic boarding school in Montreal, Canada, from which she was expelled. Lake later claimed she attended McGill University and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. This claim was included in several press biographies, although Lake later admitted it was bogus. Lake subsequently apologized to the president of McGill, who was simply amused when she explained her habit of self-dramatizing. When her stepfather fell ill during her second year, the Keane family later moved to Miami, Florida. Lake attended Miami High School, where she was known for her beauty. She had a troubled childhood and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to her mother.

==Career==
===Constance Keane===
In 1938, the Keanes moved to Beverly Hills, California. While briefly under contract to MGM, Lake enrolled in that studio&#x27;s acting farm, the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting (now the Beverly Hills Playhouse). She made friends with a girl named Gwen Horn and accompanied her when Horn went to audition at RKO. She appeared in the play &quot;Thought for Food&quot; in January 1939. A theatre critic from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;a fetching little trick&quot; for her appearance in &quot;She Made Her Bed&quot;.

Keane&#x27;s first appearance on screen was as an extra for RKO, playing a small role as one of several students in the film &quot;Sorority House&quot; (1939). The part wound up being cut from the film, but she was encouraged to continue. Similar roles followed, including &quot;All Women Have Secrets&quot; (1939), &quot;Dancing Co-Ed&quot; (also 1939), &quot;Young as You Feel&quot; (1940), and &quot;Forty Little Mothers&quot; (also 1940). &quot;Forty Little Mothers&quot; was the first time she let her hair down on screen.

===Name change and stardom===

Lake attracted the interest of Fred Wilcox, an assistant director, who shot a test scene of her performing from a play and showed it to an agent. The agent, in turn, showed it to producer Arthur Hornblow Jr., who was looking for a new girl to play the part of a nightclub singer in a military drama, &quot;I Wanted Wings&quot; (1941). Hornblow changed the actress&#x27;s name to Veronica Lake. According to him, her eyes, &quot;calm and clear like a blue lake&quot;, were the inspiration for her new name.

The film became a big hit, and made the teenage Lake a star overnight; even before the film came out, Lake was dubbed &quot;the find of 1941&quot;. During filming, Lake&#x27;s long blonde hair accidentally fell over her right eye during a take and created a &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; effect. &quot;I was playing a sympathetic drunk, I had my arm on a table ... it slipped ... and my hair – it was always baby fine and had this natural break – fell over my face ... It became my trademark and purely by accident&quot;, she recalled. The film&#x27;s success influenced women to copy the style, which became Lake&#x27;s trademark. However, Lake did not think this meant she would have a long career and maintained her goal was to be a surgeon. &quot;Only the older actors keep on a long time ... I don&#x27;t want to hang on after I&#x27;ve reached a peak. I&#x27;ll go back to medical school&quot;, she said.
Paramount announced Lake to star in &quot;China Pass&quot; and a remake of &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;. Instead, she was cast in Preston Sturges&#x27;s &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; with Joel McCrea; and film noir &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942) with Robert Preston and Alan Ladd. Her scenes with Ladd in the latter became popular with audiences, prompting Paramount to reteam them in &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, with Lake replacing Patricia Morison in the leading role. Lake was meant to be reunited with McCrea in the comedy &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, but his withdrawal from the project led to a delay in production; Fredric March was eventually cast as his replacement. Both films were highly successful, but also prevented a reunion with Hornblow for &quot;Hong Kong&quot; in which she was meant to co-star with Charles Boyer.
Upon the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II, Lake traveled throughout the United States to raise money for war bonds. She also became a popular pin-up girl for soldiers, and participated in awareness campaigns to help decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery. Lake&#x27;s only 1943 releases were both patriotic-themed. She made an appearance in Paramount&#x27;s all-star musical revue &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; performing &quot;A Sweater, Sarong and a Peek-A-Boo Bang&quot; with Paulette Goddard and Dorothy Lamour. Her only film of the year was &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; (1943) with Goddard and Claudette Colbert, in which she received acclaim for her role of a suicidal nurse. At the peak of her career, she was earning $4,500 a week.

===Personal struggles and box-office disappointments===
Despite her initial success, Lake suffered a series of setbacks that ultimately derailed her career. Her complex personality quickly led to her acquiring a reputation for being difficult to work with. On &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Lake did not disclose she was six months pregnant when filming began, upsetting director Preston Sturges to the point he had to be physically restrained. Lake also clashed with co-star McCrea to the point that he dropped out of &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, reportedly saying that &quot;Life&#x27;s too short for two films with Veronica Lake&quot; (although he did later go on to work with her in &quot;Ramrod&quot; (1947)). His replacement Frederic March also clashed with Lake after he made crude remarks about her during pre-production. Eddie Bracken was quoted as saying, &quot;She was known as &#x27;The Bitch&#x27; and she deserved the title.&quot; &quot;I Married A Witch&quot; director René Clair had a differing view of Lake, saying &quot;She was a very gifted girl, but she didn&#x27;t believe she was gifted.&quot; Lake&#x27;s behavior eventually spilt over into public view during a publicity stunt in which Lake&#x27;s services as a dishwasher and revue performer were auctioned off for war bonds. One paper claimed Lake&#x27;s &quot;talk was on the grim side&quot;, while columnist Hedda Hopper claimed that &quot;Lake clipped her own wings in her Boston bond appearance ... It&#x27;s lucky for Lake, after Boston, that she isn&#x27;t out of pictures&quot;.

With her role in &quot;The Hour Before the Dawn&quot; (1944), Lake changed her trademark hairstyle to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles. Lake had done so at the urging of the government to help decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery. The film was not a success; Lake&#x27;s image change and her unsympathetic role of Nazi spy Dora Bruckman earned negative reviews.

In late 1943, Lake took time off after undergoing a series of personal struggles. After tripping on a lighting cable while on the set of &quot;The Hour Before Dawn&quot;, Lake went into premature delivery and gave birth to a son who died shortly after birth. Within weeks, Lake had also filed for divorce from her husband. Lake also began drinking more heavily during this time.

Upon returning to work in 1944, Lake took stock of her career, claiming, &quot;I had to learn about acting. I&#x27;ve played all sorts of parts, taken just what came along regardless of high merit. In fact, I&#x27;ve been a sort of general utility person. I haven&#x27;t liked all the roles. One or two were pretty bad&quot;. Lake also expressed interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:

Lake returned with roles in the musical &quot;Bring On the Girls&quot; (1945) with Eddie Bracken and Sonny Tufts; and &quot;Hold That Blonde&quot; with Bracken. Lake enjoyed making the film, saying &quot;it&#x27;s a comedy, rather like what Carole Lombard used to do ... It represents a real change of pace&quot;. However, neither film was successful, as were minor roles in &quot;Out of This World&quot; and &quot;Miss Susie Slagle&#x27;s&quot; (1946).

===Final years at Paramount and freelance===

After her role in &quot;Miss Susie Slagle&#x27;s&quot;, producer John Houseman cast Lake in the film noir &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946). The film reunited her with Alan Ladd, who had become one of Paramount&#x27;s top stars since their last pairing in &quot;The Glass Key&quot;. Lake was pleased with the role, but her performance in the film did not impress its screenwriter Raymond Chandler, who referred to her as &quot;Moronica Lake&quot;. Nonetheless, it became her first success since &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; and the largest of her career.

For the first time in her career, Lake ventured outside of Paramount with the United Artists Western &quot;Ramrod&quot; (1947). The film was directed by her then-husband Andre de Toth, in their first collaboration. The film also reunited her with Joel McCrea, despite his earlier insistence that he would not work with her again. The film was also successful, continuing her comeback.

Following a cameo in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947), Lake and Ladd reunited again for the crime film &quot;Saigon&quot; (1948). Lake returned to her former peek-a-boo hairstyle for the film, which unlike their previous films was not a noir. Reaction to the film was mixed; although financial success, it received a more mixed critical reception in comparison to the couple&#x27;s earlier vehicles. Coupled with the flops &quot;The Sainted Sisters&quot; and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot;, Paramount opted not to renew Lake&#x27;s contract in 1948.

Following her release from Paramount, Lake took a top supporting role in &quot;Slattery&#x27;s Hurricane&quot; (1949). The film, directed by de Toth, was released by 20th Century Fox. She also appeared with Zachary Scott in the Western &quot;Stronghold&quot; (1951). Shot in Mexico for Lippert Pictures, Lake later described the film as &quot;a dog&quot; and sued for unpaid wages on the film.

Lake and de Toth announced plans to make &quot;Flanagan Boy&quot; and &quot;Before I Wake&quot;, the latter from a suspense novel by Mel Devrett. However, neither were made as the couple ran into financial difficulties. In April 1951, the IRS seized their home for unpaid taxes. Later that same year, Lake and de Toth filed for bankruptcy. Bankrupt and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Lake left de Toth and flew alone to New York. Reflecting on her departure years later, Lake said:

Lake performed in summer stock theatre and in stage roles in England. In October 1955, she collapsed in Detroit, where she had been appearing on stage in &quot;The Little Hut&quot;.

==Later years==
After her third divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. In 1962, a &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter found her living at the all-women&#x27;s Martha Washington Hotel in Manhattan, working as a waitress downstairs in the cocktail lounge. She was working under the name &quot;Connie de Toth&quot;. Lake said she took the job in part because &quot;I like people. I like to talk to them&quot;.

The reporter&#x27;s widely distributed story led to speculation that Lake was destitute. After the story ran, fans of Lake sent her money which she returned as &quot;a matter of pride&quot;. Lake vehemently denied that she was destitute and stated, &quot;It&#x27;s as though people were making me out to be down-and-out. I wasn&#x27;t. I was paying $190 a month rent then, and that&#x27;s a long way from being broke&quot;. The story did revive some interest in Lake and led to some television and stage appearances, including the 1963 off-Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;.

In 1966, she had a brief employment as a hostess on a tv show in Baltimore, Maryland, along with a largely ignored film role in &quot;Footsteps in the Snow&quot;. She also continued appearing in stage roles. She went to Freeport in the Bahamas to visit a friend and stayed on, living there for a few years.

Lake&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake&quot;, which she dictated to writer Donald Bain, were published in the United Kingdom in 1969 and in the United States the following year. In the book, Lake discusses her career, her failed marriages; romances with Howard Hughes, Tommy Manville and Aristotle Onassis; her alcoholism; and her guilt over not spending enough time with her children. In the book, Lake stated to Bain that her mother pushed her into a career as an actress. Bain quoted Lake, looking back at her career, as saying, &quot;I never did cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair&quot;. She also laughed off the term &quot;sex symbol&quot; and instead referred to herself as a &quot;sex zombie&quot;.

When she visited the UK to promote her book in 1969, she received an offer to appear on stage in &quot;Madam Chairman&quot;. Also in 1969, Lake essayed the role of Blanche DuBois in a revival of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; on the English stage; her performance won rave reviews. With the proceeds from her autobiography, after she had divided them with Bain, she co-produced and starred in her final film, &quot;Flesh Feast&quot; (1970), a low-budget horror movie with a Nazi-myth storyline.

==Personal life==
Lake&#x27;s first marriage was to art director John S. Detlie, in 1940. They had a daughter, Elaine (born in 1941), and a son, Anthony (born July 8, 1943). According to news from the time, Lake&#x27;s son was born prematurely after she tripped on a lighting cable while filming a movie. Anthony died on July 15, 1943. Lake and Detlie separated in August 1943 and divorced in December 1943.

In 1944, Lake married film director Andre de Toth with whom she had a son, Andre Anthony Michael III (known as Michael DeToth), and a daughter, Diana (born October 1948). Days before Diana&#x27;s birth, Lake&#x27;s mother sued her for support payments. After purchasing an airplane for de Toth, Lake earned her pilot&#x27;s license in 1946. She later flew solo between Los Angeles and New York when leaving him. Lake and de Toth divorced in 1952.

In September 1955, she married songwriter Joseph Allan McCarthy. They were divorced in 1959. In 1969, she revealed that she rarely saw her children.

==Death==
In June 1973, Lake returned from her autobiography promotion and summer stock tour in England to the United States and while traveling in Vermont, visited a local doctor, complaining of stomach pains. She was discovered to have cirrhosis of the liver as a result of her years of drinking, and on June 26, she checked into the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.

She died there on July 7, 1973, of acute hepatitis and acute kidney injury. Her son Michael claimed her body. Lake&#x27;s memorial service was held at the Universal Chapel in New York City on July 11.

She was cremated and, according to her wishes, her ashes were scattered off the coast of the Virgin Islands. In 2004, some of Lake&#x27;s ashes were reportedly found in a New York antique store.

==Legacy==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Lake has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Filmography==


==Selected stage credits==
==In popular culture==

Clips from her role in &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942) were integrated into the 1982 film &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; as character Monica Stillpond.

Lake was one of the models for the animated character Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&quot;, especially for her hairstyle.

In the 1997 film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, Kim Basinger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a prostitute who is a Veronica Lake look-alike.

A geographical feature called &quot;Lake Veronica&quot; was a recurring joke in the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; series and film.

In the video game &quot;BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea&quot; (2013–14), the visual style of the character Elizabeth was inspired by Veronica Lake&#x27;s femme fatale roles.

In April, 2023, Sparks released &quot;Veronica Lake&quot;, a single from their album &quot;The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte&quot;. The song describes how Lake was asked to change her hairstyle so that women on the war assembly lines who imitated it wouldn&#x27;t harm themselves by catching their hair in the machinery, and that, by agreeing to do so, she voluntarily gave up much of the popularity that she had gained by her distinctive hairstyle.

<doc id="336962" wikidata="Q357502" url="?curid=336962" title="Patrick Roy">
<text>Patrick Jacques Roy (; born October 5, 1965) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach, executive and former player who is the head coach for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). Roy previously served as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL, as well as the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history and was hailed in sports media as &quot;king of goaltenders&quot;.

Nicknamed &quot;Saint Patrick&quot;, Roy split his playing career in the National Hockey League (NHL) between the Montreal Canadiens, with whom he played for 11 years, and the Colorado Avalanche, with whom he played for eight years. Roy won the Stanley Cup four times during his career, two with each franchise.

In 2004, Roy was selected as the greatest goaltender in NHL history by a panel of 41 writers, coupled with a simultaneous fan poll. On November 13, 2006, Roy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is the only player in NHL history to win the Conn Smythe Trophy (the award given to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs) three times, the only one to do so in three different decades (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and the only one to do so for two different teams. Roy&#x27;s number 33 sweater is retired by both the Canadiens and Avalanche.

Roy is widely credited with popularizing the butterfly style of goaltending, which has since become the dominant style of goaltending around the world.

Roy was born in Quebec City but grew up in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. His parents are Barbara (Miller) and Michel Roy, and he has a younger brother, Stéphane. Roy became interested in being an ice hockey goaltender when he was seven years old. He played in the 1977 and 1978 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments on a minor ice hockey team from Quebec City, which included his brother in 1978. After playing for the local Sainte-Foy Gouverneurs, he played for the Granby Bisons of the QMJHL(Quebec Major Junior Hockey League). He then began his professional career with the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the American Hockey League (AHL).

==Playing career==
===Montreal Canadiens (1984–95)===
Roy was drafted in the third round, 51st overall, in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens, a team he disliked, being a fan of the rival Quebec Nordiques. His grandmother Anna Peacock was a big Canadiens fan, but died before seeing her grandson being drafted. Roy kept playing for the Granby Bisons of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) before being called up by the Canadiens. Despite the thoughts that he was not going to play for the team, on February 23, 1985, he made his NHL debut when he replaced the Canadiens&#x27; starting goaltender, Doug Soetaert, in the game&#x27;s third period. Roy played for 20 minutes and earned his first NHL win without allowing a goal. After the game, he was reassigned to the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the AHL. Despite starting as a backup, Roy replaced Greg Moffett after he had equipment troubles during a game. He earned a win, became the starting goaltender for the playoffs and led the team to a Calder Cup championship with ten wins in 13 games.

In the following season, Roy started playing regularly for the Canadiens and took over the starting goaltender&#x27;s job when incumbent Steve Penney was injured in January. He played 47 games during the regular season and won the starting job for the Stanley Cup playoffs, where he emerged as a star, leading his team to an unexpected Stanley Cup title and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy for the Most Valuable Player in the playoffs. As a 20-year-old, he became the youngest Conn Smythe winner ever and was chosen for the NHL All-Rookie Team.

Nicknamed St. Patrick after the victory, Roy continued playing for the Canadiens, who won the Adams Division in 1987–88 and in 1988–89, when they lost to the Calgary Flames in the Stanley Cup Finals. Roy, together with Brian Hayward, won the William M. Jennings Trophy in 1987, 1988, and 1989, as the Canadiens regularly allowed the fewest goals against. In 1989 and 1990, he won the Vezina Trophy for best goaltender in the NHL and was voted for the NHL first All-Star team. In 1991–92, the Canadiens won the Adams Division again, with Roy having a very successful individual year, winning the William M. Jennings Trophy, and Vezina Trophy and being selected for the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star team. Despite the successful regular season, the Canadiens were swept in the second round by the Boston Bruins, who stopped their playoff run for the fourth time in five years.

In the 1992–93 season, the Canadiens fell from first overall in March to finish the regular season third in their division behind title winner Boston Bruins and a resurgent second-place Quebec Nordiques. During the first round of the 1993 playoffs against the archrival Nordiques, Roy was in a goaltending duel against Ron Hextall; Hextall was also a Vezina and Conn Smythe winner with his previous team, the Philadelphia Flyers, when they had several ill-tempered postseason encounters with Roy&#x27;s Canadiens in the 1980s. The Canadiens lost the first two games of the series with Roy letting in soft goals, and a newspaper in Roy&#x27;s hometown district suggested that he be traded with the headline &quot;NORDIQUES WIN GAME, BATTLE OF GOALIES,&quot; while the subhead added (Quebec goaltender Ron) &quot;HEXTALL GETS BETTER OF ROY.&quot; Nordiques Goaltending Coach Dan Bouchard also proclaimed that his team had &quot;solved Roy.&quot; These comments seemed to fire up Roy, who responded by winning the next four games against the Nordiques (Roy was replaced for part of Game Five by backup André Racicot after being struck by a puck in the collarbone), sweeping the Buffalo Sabres in the next round and winning the first three against the New York Islanders to tie the record of an 11-game playoff winning streak. Roy also set a record with ten straight playoff overtime wins – two against Quebec, three against Buffalo, two against the New York Islanders (where he denied Benoît Hogue and Pierre Turgeon on breakaways during overtime), and three against the Los Angeles Kings in the Stanley Cup Finals. Roy had led his team, which did not have a player that finished in the top twenty regular season scoring, to the Stanley Cup championship and was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner.

In 1994, the Canadiens were the defending champions but they were knocked out in the first round by the Boston Bruins. Nonetheless, that seven-game series was notable in the eyes of Montreal fans as Roy came down with appendicitis and missed Game 3. He convinced doctors to let him return for Game 4 and led the Canadiens to a 5–2 victory, stopping 39 shots. Roy was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, finishing third in voting behind winner Dominik Hašek and runner-up John Vanbiesbrouck.

====Trade to Colorado====
Four games into the 1995–96 season, Mario Tremblay was hired as Montreal&#x27;s new head coach, replacing Jacques Demers who had been fired. Roy and Tremblay, who had roomed together while teammates, had a notably strained relationship, with Tremblay regularly mocking Roy for speaking broken English. Roy was a frequent target of Tremblay during the latter&#x27;s sports radio career. The two had almost come to blows in two incidents in 1995, one at a Long Island coffee shop before Tremblay was announced as head coach, and Roy snickered when Tremblay arrived in the dressing room for the first time. They almost fought again after Tremblay allegedly fired a shot at Roy&#x27;s throat during practice.

On December 2, 1995, in his 22nd game (and the team&#x27;s 24th) of the 1995–96 season, Roy was in net against the Detroit Red Wings during Montreal&#x27;s worst home game in franchise history, an 11–1 loss. Roy allowed nine goals on 26 shots, which was highly unusual, as star goaltenders are generally taken out of the game quickly when it is clear they are struggling. During the second period, when Montreal was trailing 7–1 in the game, the crowd provided mock applause after Roy made an easy save on Sergei Fedorov from centre ice, prompting him to sarcastically raise his arms in mock celebration. Tremblay finally pulled Roy in the middle of the second period in favour of Pat Jablonski.
During Molson Breweries&#x27; tenure as owner of the team, the rows of seats immediately behind the Canadiens&#x27; bench were under the exclusive control of Molson and as such were typically reserved for the use of executives of the Canadiens, Molson, or invited dignitaries. Since these seats were not available to the public, the standard glass partitions that separate hockey spectators from the team benches were not installed behind the home bench of the Forum. Because of this unusual arrangement, an enraged Roy had no time to regain his composure before approaching the team&#x27;s top brass who were in attendance and their usual seats. Upon reaching the bench, Roy immediately stormed past his coach and told Canadiens President Ronald Corey &quot;It&#x27;s my last game in Montreal&quot;, before storming past Tremblay again and sitting down. The next day, Roy was suspended by the Canadiens.

At the time, Tremblay told the media that he regretted not pulling Roy earlier in the game, but Roy later said that despite allowing five goals on 17 shots in the first, Tremblay kept him in the net to humiliate him. In later interviews, Roy cited a general distaste with what he thought was a loosening of standards with the team.

Four days after the incident, the Canadiens traded Roy and captain Mike Keane to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. The return for Roy was seen as uneven at the time it was made and eventually became known as one of the most one-sided deals in NHL history. Canadiens General Manager Réjean Houle at the time had been GM for only 40 days and faced criticism for making the trade instead of trying to resolve the tension between Roy and Tremblay.

===Colorado Avalanche (1996–2003)===
In the 1995–96 season, after his mid-season trade from the Canadiens, Roy helped the Avalanche win their first Stanley Cup in their first season after moving from Quebec. He was a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy to Jim Carey.

In the 1996 Western Conference Semifinals against the Chicago Blackhawks, Jeremy Roenick was stopped by Roy on a breakaway during overtime in Game 4, while being hauled down by Avalanche defenceman Sandis Ozolinsh. The referee did not call for a penalty shot on the play and the Avalanche won in triple overtime on Joe Sakic&#x27;s game-winning goal. Two days prior, Roenick had scored on an unchallenged breakaway to tie the game and send it to overtime, and the Blackhawks ended up winning Game 3. After Game 4, Roenick told the media, &quot;It should have been a penalty shot, there&#x27;s no doubt about it. I like Patrick&#x27;s quote that he would&#x27;ve stopped me. I&#x27;d just want to know where he was in Game 3, probably getting his jock out of the rafters in the United Center maybe.&quot; Roy retorted with: &quot;I can&#x27;t really hear what Jeremy says, because I&#x27;ve got my two Stanley Cup rings plugging my ears.&quot; Roy and the Avalanche beat the Blackhawks in six games and went on to win the Stanley Cup.

Roy was a large part of the Avalanche–Red Wings rivalry, which also involved players Adam Foote and Brendan Shanahan, among others. The Avalanche and Red Wings met in the playoffs five times from 1996 to 2002, with the Avs winning in 1996, 1999, and 2000. The heated competition between teams is linked to the 11–1 Montreal loss to Detroit that precipitated Roy&#x27;s midseason trade to Colorado in December 1995, and in that season&#x27;s 1996 Conference Finals Roy helped his new team eliminate first-place Detroit. During the Avalanche–Red Wings brawl in 1997, he fought the Wings&#x27; goaltender Mike Vernon. The next season, he fought another Red Wings goaltender, Chris Osgood. In what would be Roy&#x27;s final playoff meeting with Detroit, he was pulled after allowing six goals in Game 7 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals, a game Detroit won 7–0 to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.

In 2000–01, Roy&#x27;s Avalanche won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for the best regular season record. In the playoffs, his team advanced to the Finals, where they faced the defending champion New Jersey Devils, who were backstopped by Martin Brodeur, a star netminder who had idolized Roy as a child. In Game 4, while playing the puck behind his net, Roy could not make a clearing pass, allowing the Devils to score into an empty net to tie the game. Roy had his worst game of the Finals in a 4–1 loss during Game 5, which gave the Devils a 3–2 series lead but rebounded in Game 6 by stopping 24 shots for his then-record 19th career playoff shutout in a 4–0 victory. The Avalanche jumped to a three-goal lead in Game 7 before conceding one consolation goal to win their second Stanley Cup. Roy was named playoff MVP for the third time in his career, an NHL record. Roy has said that he and his teammates had wanted to win it for Ray Bourque, who finally won his first Cup after 22 seasons in the NHL; Bourque who had previously played 21 seasons with the Boston Bruins had numerous playoff encounters against Roy when he was with the Canadiens.

Roy&#x27;s final game was played against the Minnesota Wild on April 22, 2003, in a Game 7 overtime loss in the first round of the 2003 playoffs.

Patrick Roy announced his retirement on May 28, 2003.

==International play==
Roy was selected as Canada&#x27;s starting goaltender for the 1998 Winter Olympics. Roy played all six games, but Canada failed to win a medal after a shootout loss to the Czech Republic in the semifinal. Roy and Hašek both had save percentages above .950 entering into the game, and regulation ended in a 1–1 tie. After a scoreless overtime, the Czechs beat Canada 1–0 in the tiebreaking shootout. After the loss, their first of the tournament, the Canadians could not regain momentum for the bronze medal game and subsequently lost 3–2 to Finland, denying Roy his only chance at an Olympic medal. Roy had a 4–2 record with one shutout while averaging 1.46 goals against per game and stopping .935 percent of total shots faced.

Roy declined the opportunity to play for Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics before the team&#x27;s selection took place.

==Post-playing career==

After retiring from the NHL, Roy joined the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) as vice-president of hockey operations; he also became the owner and general manager, and on September 29, 2005, he was named head coach of the team.

On May 28, 2006, the Remparts won the 2006 Memorial Cup, the top Canadian Hockey League (CHL) tournament, beating the Moncton Wildcats 6–2 in the finals (although the Remparts were only the runner-up in the 2006 QMJHL championship, they were able to participate in the Memorial Cup since the QMJHL champions were the host city—see Memorial Cup, 1983 to present). Roy is the seventh coach to win the Cup in his rookie year, and the first to do so since Claude Julien with the Hull Olympiques in 1997.

On January 19, 2007, Saguenay Police investigated an incident involving Roy and the co-owner of the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, Pierre Cardinal. There were reports that Roy threw punches at the co-owner after he intervened to disperse a crowd of hockey fans that were blocking the Remparts&#x27; bus after a game between the two clubs. A complaint for assault had been filed against Roy, who faced possible assault charges in the matter. Montreal newspaper &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; reported that Roy later apologized to the victim via telephone. In a press conference following a Remparts game on January 21, 2007, Roy said that he was &quot;suffering prejudice on the part of the media,&quot; and believed that he was not guilty of the incident. He then questioned his future as head coach and co-owner of the team, even considering resigning from his duties. On January 25, 2007, Pierre Cardinal announced that he removed his complaint against Roy before Roy made a press conference about his future in the Remparts, where he announced he will stay coach and co-owner of the team.

On March 22, 2008, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Roy was involved in another on-ice incident during Game 2 of a first-round playoff series against the rival Saguenéens. Late in the second period, in which the Saguenéens were leading 7–1, a brawl started and Remparts goaltender Jonathan Roy, Roy&#x27;s son, charged towards opposing goaltender Bobby Nadeau. Jonathan hit Nadeau numerous times despite Nadeau indicating he did not want to fight. After knocking Nadeau down, Jonathan continued to hit Nadeau. Jonathan then fought a second Saguenéens player before skating off the ice while holding both middle fingers up to the crowd. Roy denied inciting his son Jonathan to fight, despite video evidence showing Roy making a gesture towards his son while he was advancing towards Nadeau. After an investigation by the League office, Patrick Roy was suspended for five games and fined $4,000, while his son Jonathan was suspended for seven games and fined $500. The Quebec Ministry of Public Safety has launched a police investigation into the matter. In late July 2008, Jonathan was charged with assault in Saguenay courts.

On November 21, 2008, Roy&#x27;s other son, Frederick Roy, found trouble playing for the Remparts when he cross-checked an opponent in the head after a stoppage in play. Frederick was ultimately suspended 15 games by the QMJHL for the incident, which occurred the night before Patrick Roy&#x27;s jersey retirement ceremony in Montreal.

In May 2009, several unnamed sources reported that Roy was offered the head coaching position with the Colorado Avalanche. He turned down the position, but expressed the possibility of becoming an NHL-level coach at some future date.

In September 2012, Roy started a new chapter in his career by becoming a permanent member of the French–Canadian hockey talk show &quot;l&#x27;Antichambre&quot;, where he worked as a hockey analyst. He was reunited on the set with his former head coach, Mario Tremblay, the man in part responsible for his departure from Montreal.

In January 2024, it was announced that Roy, in partnership with Canadian businessmen Jean Bédard and Jacques Tanguay (a former owner of the Remparts), had purchased a minority stake in Boxers de Bordeaux, a professional team playing in the French Ligue Magnus.

===NHL coaching career===

On May 23, 2013, Roy was named head coach and vice-president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche. TSN&#x27;s Bob McKenzie reported that Roy would have the final say in all hockey matters. Then Avalanche General Manager Greg Sherman retained his post, but was considered the general manager &quot;in name only.&quot; At the time, Roy was the only coach in the NHL who had the title or powers of General Manager. Before the season started, his former Avs teammate, Joe Sakic, was hired as Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations. Although the title nominally put him above Roy on the organization chart, Roy and Sakic shared most of the duties normally held by a general manager in the NHL–a practice that continued after Sakic was formally granted the title of General Manager in 2014.

Roy&#x27;s first regular season game with the Colorado Avalanche as coach was the home opener on October 2, 2013, a 6–1 win over the Anaheim Ducks, where Roy got into a shouting match with Ducks Head Coach Bruce Boudreau and nearly broke the partition separating the two teams&#x27; benches. Roy won his first six games as a rookie coach, coincidentally tying Mario Tremblay, his former coach with whom he had a feuding relationship, for the most consecutive wins at the beginning of an NHL coaching career.

In the 2013–14 season, Colorado racked up 112 points, won the Central Division title, tied a franchise record with 52 wins, posted the NHL&#x27;s best road record (26–11–4) and had zero regulation losses when leading after two periods (35–0–3). For his team&#x27;s success, Roy won the Jack Adams Award for the NHL&#x27;s top coach, winning the honour over the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Mike Babcock and the Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27;s Jon Cooper.

During the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, Roy became known for aggressively pulling goaltender Semyon Varlamov to set up a 6-on-5, empty-net scenario, sometimes with as much as three minutes remaining in the game. However, the heavily favoured #2 seed Avalanche ultimately lost in the first round to the #7 seed Minnesota Wild at home in Game 7.

The following season, the Avalanche regressed significantly, finishing last (seventh) in their division for only the third time in the history of the organization.

On August 11, 2016, Roy, citing a lack of input in personnel decisions, stepped down as the head coach and vice-president of hockey operations for the Avalanche, and was subsequently replaced by Jared Bednar.

On January 20, 2024, the New York Islanders fired Lane Lambert as head coach and named Roy as his successor. He made his Islanders debut on January 21, and earned his first win as Islanders head coach with a 3–2 overtime victory over the Dallas Stars.

==Personal life==
Patrick Roy married Michèle Piuze on June 9, 1990. They have three children: Jonathan, Frederick and Jana. His sons, Frederick and Jonathan, played for the Quebec Remparts during Roy&#x27;s tenure as head coach of the team. His son Jonathan has since left hockey to pursue a music career.

While playing for the Avalanche, Patrick Roy was arrested for domestic violence on October 22, 2000, and was released on $750 bail. Roy and his wife were in an argument, and his wife made a hangup call to 911. Police found physical damage to the house and took Roy into custody. The presiding judge dismissed the case, citing it did not meet the standard for criminal mischief in a case of domestic violence. Roy and Piuze divorced in early 2005; Roy has not remarried.

Since the 1980s, Roy has been a significant contributor to the Ronald McDonald House charity.

Roy was known for superstitious quirks. He often talked to the net posts, and he never talked to reporters on days in which he was scheduled to play. He also refused to let his skates touch the red and blue lines on the ice, stepping over them.

==Legacy==

In 1989, 1990, and 1992, Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best goaltender. He won the Jennings Trophy (fewest goals allowed) in 1987, 1988, 1989 (all shared with Brian Hayward), 1992 and 2002. He led the NHL in shutouts and goals against average twice, was named a First Team All-Star four times, a Second Team All-Star twice, and played in 11 National Hockey League All-Star Games. Roy has also won a record three Conn Smythe Trophies as NHL playoff MVP (1986, 1993 and 2001). Among the many goaltending NHL records Roy holds are career playoff games played (247) and career playoff wins (151).

The Avalanche retired Roy&#x27;s number 33 jersey on October 28, 2003, while the Montreal Canadiens retired Roy&#x27;s number 33 on November 22, 2008. This made Roy the sixth NHL player to have his number retired by two organizations. Roy was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2006, his first year of eligibility.

Roy won over 200 games with two franchises (Montreal and Colorado).

Along with Terry Sawchuk, Roy is directly credited with inspiring the jersey numbers that NHL goaltenders use; both are cited as the primary reason goaltenders have come to choose numbers in the 30s since their respective careers.

British Columbia-born baseball player and former American League MVP Justin Morneau wore number 33 in tribute to Roy.

<doc id="336964" wikidata="Q464120" url="?curid=336964" title="Melchora Aquino">
<text>Melchora Aquino (January 6, 1812 – February 19, 1919) was a Filipino revolutionary. She became known as &quot;Tandang Sora&quot; (&quot;tandang&quot; meaning &quot;old&quot;) because of her old age during the Philippine Revolution (1896-1899). She was also known as the &quot;Grand Woman of the Revolution&quot; and the &quot;Mother of Balintawak&quot; for her contributions.

==Early life and marriage==
Melchora Aquino was born on January 6, 1812, in Barrio Banlat, Caloocan (the present-day Barangay Tandang Sora, Quezon City). Having been born on the feast of the Epiphany, she was named after Melchior, one of the Three Wise Men.

Melchora, daughter of a peasant couple, Juan and Valentina Aquino, never attended school. However, she was apparently literate at an early age and talented as a singer and performed at local events as well as at Mass for her Church. She was also often chosen for the role of &quot;Reyna Elena&quot; during the &quot;Santacruzan&quot;, a processional pageant commemorating Empress Helen&#x27;s finding of the Cross of Christ, celebrated in the Philippines in May.

Later in life, she married Fulgencio Ramos, a &quot;cabeza de barrio&quot; (village chief), and bore six children. As his wife she was known as Melchora Aquino de Ramos (&quot;of Ramos&quot;). Her husband died when their youngest child was 7 and she was left as a single parent for their children. Tandang Sora continued her life as an &quot;hermana mayor&quot; active in celebrating &quot;fiestas&quot;, baptisms, and weddings. She worked hard in order to give her children education.

==Involvement in the revolution==
In her native town, Tandang Sora operated a store, which became a refuge for the sick and wounded revolutionaries. She fed, gave medical attention to and encouraged the revolutionaries with motherly advice and prayers. 

Secret meetings of the Katipuneros (revolutionaries) were also held at her house in August 1896. Due to the maternal nature of her help for the revolution, she received names such as &quot;Woman of Revolution&quot;, &quot;Mother of Balintawak&quot;, &quot;Mother of the Philippine Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Tandang Sora&quot; (&quot;Tandang&quot; is derived from the Tagalog word &quot;matandâ&quot;, which means old). She and her son, Juan Ramos, were present in the Cry of Balintawak and were witnesses to the tearing up of the &quot;cedulas&quot;.

When the Spaniards learned about her activities and her knowledge to the whereabouts of the Katipuneros, she was arrested by the &quot;guardia civil&quot; on August 29, 1896. She was held captive in the house of a &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot; of Pasong Putik, Novaliches and then transferred to Bilibid Prison in Manila. While in prison, she was interrogated but she refused to divulge any information. She was then deported to Guam, Marianas Islands by Governor General Ramón Blanco on September 2. In Guam, she and a woman named Segunda Puentes were placed under house arrest in the residence of a Don Justo Dungca.

After the United States took control of the Philippines in 1898, Tandang Sora, like other exiles, returned to the Philippines in 1903. She later became an active member of the Philippine Independent Church. 

==Death==
She died at her daughter Saturnina&#x27;s house in Banlat on February 19, 1919, at the age of 107. She received full state honors shortly after her death after years of being unnoticed for her efforts in the revolution. Her remains were first interred at the Mausoleum of the Veterans of the Revolution at the Manila North Cemetery. These were then transferred to the Himlayang Pilipino Memorial Park in Quezon City in 1970 and finally at the Tandang Sora National Shrine in 2012.

==Legacy==
As a token of gratitude, a Quezon City barangay and a road were named after Tandang Sora. Her profile was also placed in the Philippines&#x27; five-centavo coin from 1967 to 1994. She was the first Filipina who appears on a Philippine peso banknote, in this case, a 100-peso bill from the English Series (1951–1966). Tandang Sora Street in the city of San Francisco is named in her honor.

In 2012, on the celebration of her 200th birthday, the Quezon City local government decided to transfer Tandang Sora&#x27;s remains from Himlayang Pilipino Memorial Park to the Tandang Sora National Shrine. They also declared 2012 as be Tandang Sora Year.
Her descendants carry different surnames, with almost all living in Novaliches and Tandang Sora districts in Quezon City as well as in Guam such as Figueroa, Ramos (her husband&#x27;s surname), Geronimo, Eugenio, Cleofas and Apo.

A Philippine Coast Guard vessel was named after her, the BRP Melchora Aquino.

<doc id="336965" wikidata="Q1374916" url="?curid=336965" title="Luis Russell">
<text>Luis Carl Russell (August 5, 1902 – December 11, 1963) was a pioneering Panamanian jazz pianist, orchestra leader, composer, and arranger.

==Career==
Luis Carl Russell was born on Careening Cay, near Bocas del Toro, Panama, in a family of African-Caribbean ancestry. His father was a music teacher, and Russell learned to play guitar, piano, and violin. He had begun playing professionally, accompanying silent films by 1917 and later at a casino in Colón, Panama.

In 1919, he won $3,000 in a lottery and used it to move to the United States, with his mother and sister, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he worked as a pianist. He moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1925 and worked with Doc Cook and King Oliver. The Oliver band moved to New York City, and Russell left to form his own band. By 1929, Russell&#x27;s band became one of the leading jazz groups in New York City. It had several former Oliver sidemen. Performers in his band included trumpeter Red Allen, trombonist J. C. Higginbotham, and alto saxophonist Albert Nicholas. Louis Armstrong took over the band in 1935.

Between 1926 and 1934, Russell recorded 38 sides (mostly using his own name), plus those issued under Red Allen (1929) and a handful where Armstrong led his band. After the OKeh contract ended in September 1930, Russell recorded a handful of sessions for Melotone, Brunswick and Victor. After no recordings under his name between late 1931 and late 1934, Russell recorded a session for ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, Banner, Romeo) in 1934, which yielded six sides (three featured Sonny Woods&#x27;s novelty vocals, one featured the vocal group the Palmer Brothers).

The band returned to Russell&#x27;s name, while Armstrong played in California and Europe in the early 1930s; Russell and Armstrong were reunited in 1935. That same year, Armstrong took over the orchestra altogether, and for the next eight years they functioned as back-up band for Armstrong, with Russell acting as the musical director.

Russell led a new band from 1943 to 1948 that played at the Savoy and Apollo and made a few recordings. These included his 1946 version of the pop standard, &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;. In 1948, Russell retired from music and opened a notions shop, with irregular band gigs and teaching music on the side. In 1959, he visited Panama where he gave a piano recital of classical music.

He died in New York City at the age of 61. His daughter, Catherine Russell, is a jazz singer.

<doc id="336966" wikidata="Q229635" url="?curid=336966" title="Eileen Collins">
<text>Eileen Marie Collins (born 19 November 1956) is an American retired NASA astronaut and Air Force colonel. A flight instructor and test pilot, Collins was the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle and the first to command a Space Shuttle mission.

A graduate of Corning Community College, where she earned an associate degree in mathematics in 1976, and Syracuse University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and economics in 1978, Collins was commissioned as an officer in the USAF through Syracuse&#x27;s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program. She was one of four women chosen for Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. After earning her pilot wings, she stayed on at Vance for three years as a T-38 Talon instructor pilot before transitioning to the C-141 Starlifter at Travis Air Force Base, California. During the American invasion of Grenada in October 1983, her aircraft flew troops of the 82nd Airborne Division from (then) Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina to Grenada, and took thirty-six medical students back. From 1986 to 1989, she was an assistant professor in mathematics and a T-41 instructor pilot at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. She earned a Master of Science degree in operations research from Stanford University in 1986, and a Master of Arts degree in space systems management from Webster University in 1989. That year, she became the second woman pilot to attend the USAF Test Pilot School, graduating with class 89B.

In 1990, Collins was selected to be a pilot astronaut with NASA Astronaut Group 13. She flew the Space Shuttle as the pilot of the 1995 STS-63 mission, which involved a space rendezvous between and the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. She was also the pilot for STS-84 in 1997. She became the first woman to command a US spacecraft with STS-93, which launched in July 1999 and deployed the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. In 2005 she commanded STS-114, NASA&#x27;s &quot;return to flight&quot; mission after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, to test safety improvements, and resupply the International Space Station (ISS). During this mission she became the first astronaut to fly the Space Shuttle orbiter through a complete 360-degree pitch maneuver so astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of its belly to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage during re-entry. She retired from the USAF in January 2005 with the rank of colonel, and from NASA in May 2006.

==Early life==
Eileen Marie Collins was born in Elmira, New York, on 19 November 1956. Her parents were James Edward Collins and his wife Rose Marie O&#x27;Hara. Her father&#x27;s ancestors came to the United States from County Cork in Ireland in the mid-1800s, settling in Pennsylvania and Elmira, New York. She had three siblings: an older brother, a younger sister, and a younger brother. Her father served in the US Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After the war he managed the family bar, and then became a surveyor. Her parents separated when she was young, and her mother took a job as a stenographer at the Elmira Correctional Facility. As a child, Collins was shy and needed speech therapy for her stutter. She joined the Girl Scouts. She expressed an early interest in becoming a pilot, subscribing to &quot;Air Force Magazine&quot; and reading books about World War II-era military aviators such as &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; and &quot;God Is My Co-Pilot&quot;.

Collins attended St. Patrick&#x27;s School in Elmira up to the eighth grade and then Notre Dame High School, a Catholic high school, but was unhappy there. The family home was badly damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in June 1972, and with finances tight, she was able to convince her mother to allow her to transfer to Elmira Free Academy, a public high school. After graduating from Elmira Free Academy in 1974, Collins considered enlisting in the US Air Force, but her father was adamantly opposed. Instead, she attended Corning Community College, where she earned an associate degree in mathematics in 1976. She then entered Syracuse University, which she chose because it had an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program.

In 1975, the United States Air Force (USAF) changed its policy to allow women to train as pilots, although only for non-combat missions. The first ten women chosen for pilot training in September 1976 were all serving Air Force officers with four-year college degrees. They graduated in September 1977. Collins noted their names and followed their progress and subsequent careers with interest, hoping to soon follow in their footsteps.

Six weeks after graduating from Corning, Collins reported to (then) Rickenbacker Air Force Base for her basic training. Women had different fitness standards from men, but Collins was granted permission to do the morning run with the men, who had to run in less than 12 minutes. The training included classes on the history of the USAF and the theory of flight, a ride in a Fairchild C-123 Provider, and a flight in a Cessna T-37 Tweet with an instructor. She took flying lessons in a Cessna 150 at Elmira Corning Regional Airport, eventually flying solo, but did not have time to complete all the requirements for a private pilot license.

In January 1978, Collins received orders to report to Offutt Air Force Base upon graduation from Syracuse, to become a computer systems engineer. Before this could occur, the Syracuse AFROTC commander, Colonel Vernon Hagen, informed her that the USAF was now accepting up to ten women from AFROTC programs for pilot training; the first ten women graduated on 2 September 1977. He offered to put her name forward. Collins eagerly accepted the offer, but a physical examination at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base revealed that although she had 20/20 visual acuity in her right eye, she had only 20/25 in the left, leading to her being rejected. Hagen told her to rest her eyes, and ordered a re-test, which she passed. She graduated later that year with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics.

==Air Force career==
Upon graduation from Syracuse, Collins was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the USAF. She received orders to report to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas for the Flight Screening Program (FSP) In August 1978. She was one of four women in the class; there were ten men. The purpose of the FSP was to screen out unsuitable pilots before sending them to the more expensive Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) program. Collins was almost eliminated on medical grounds due to her left eye and a suspected heart murmur, but was cleared to fly. Training flights were conducted from nearby Hondo Municipal Airport in Cessna T-41 Mescalero aircraft.
For her UPT, Collins requested that she be assigned to Williams Air Force Base in Arizona, where the first ten women had trained, but the USAF personnel office decided to send her to Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma. There were three other women in her class, 79–08. She decorated her helmet with the logo E = mc2, an allusion to both her initials and Albert Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equivalence equation. Flight training was conducted in the T-37 Tweet. On 24 November 1978, she became the first member of her class to fly solo.

The second phase of instruction began in March 1979 in the Northrop T-38 Talon, a jet trainer. She received her pilot wings at the conclusion of this training, and was selected to become a flight instructor. There remained some training before she could join an operational unit. First, there was a week of Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training. The top-ranking members of the class went on to fly single-pilot aircraft, while the others became co-pilots. Most single-pilot aircraft were combat aircraft, which woman could not yet fly, so she stayed on at Vance as a T-38 Talon instructor pilot. This involved four weeks of pilot instructor training, which was conducted at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was the first woman to become a T-38 instructor pilot, and the only woman flight instructor at Vance between September 1979 and December 1982.

Now a captain, Collins set her sights on becoming an astronaut. To achieve this goal, she aimed to graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School. Entry required at least one year as an aircraft commander in an operational aircraft and over one thousand hours flying time. She had already accumulated over a thousand hours flying as an instructor at Vance, but the USAF does not consider a trainer an operational aircraft, unlike a fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, transport, or refueling aircraft. Collins requested an assignment flying the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, or Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, but women were still not permitted to fly combat aircraft, so she was assigned to Travis Air Force Base in California, to fly the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, a transport aircraft that had been her 21st choice, as a co-pilot. She flew long-range missions such as the &quot;Double Diego&quot; run to Diego Garcia via Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, and Clark Air Base in the Philippines. The aircraft then flew to Clark and Diego Garcia again, before heading homeward via Singapore, Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, Yokota Air Base in Japan and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. She also flew the &quot;coral run&quot; to Kwajalein Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll, and Midway Atoll, and to European destinations in Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey, and the United Kingdom in support of the annual Reforger exercises.
During the American invasion of Grenada in October 1983, her aircraft flew troops of the 82nd Airborne Division from (then) Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina to Grenada, and took thirty-six medical students back. Although women were not supposed to fly in combat, the USAF gave her combat pay for the mission, and awarded her the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. After nine months as a co-pilot, she was upgraded to first pilot. After attending aircraft commander school at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, and aerial refueling training, she was upgraded to aircraft commander in June 1984.

From August 1986 to June 1989, Collins was assigned to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado, where she was an assistant professor in mathematics, teaching courses on calculus and linear algebra, and a T-41 instructor pilot. Through the Air Force Institute of Technology, she earned a Master of Science in operations research from Stanford University in 1986, and a Master of Arts in space systems management from Webster University in 1989. She had begun dating a fellow C-141 pilot, James P. (Pat) Youngs, in August 1983. Youngs was also posted to the Air Force Academy, as a golf instructor. They were married on 1 August 1987. Youngs eventually left the USAF to fly as a commercial pilot for Delta Air Lines, thereby giving himself the flexibility to follow Collins as her career progressed.

Earning an advanced degree improved her chances of being selected for the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California, but USAF rules required officers to pay back their tuition by serving with the duty assignment that provided the funding. This meant that she was supposed to remain at the Air Force Academy for three years. She hoped that this rule would be waived, but her first two applications for the USAF Test Pilot School were rejected on these grounds. When she applied for a third time in 1989, she had been in the USAF for longer than the ten-year maximum allowed before entering the USAF Test Pilot School, but this time a waiver was granted. In the meantime, Captain Jacquelyn Susan &quot;Jackie&quot; Parker became the first woman to graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School in 1988.

Collins became the second woman pilot to attend when she joined Class 89B in June 1989. She was also the most senior member of the class, as she was the only one with the rank of major, which made her the class leader. At Edwards she flew several types of aircraft, including the Lockheed TR-1, P-3 Orion, and C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada UV-18 Twin Otter, the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, Learjet 24, Beechcraft King Air, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-111, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Vought A-7 Corsair II, and the Goodyear Blimp. She graduated in June 1990.

==Astronaut career==

===Selection and training===

On 17 April 1989, the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) announced that it was selecting another class of astronauts. Collins&#x27;s application was one of nearly 2,500 received by the 30 June 1989 deadline, of which 1,945 met the minimum requirements for pilots or mission specialists. Because she had not yet graduated from the USAF Test Pilot School, the USAF submitted her application as one for a mission specialist. NASA convened a selection board chaired by the Director of Flight Crew Operations, Don Puddy, which also included Carolyn Huntoon, the Director of Life Sciences; Joseph Atkinson, the Chief of Equal Opportunity Programs; and astronauts John Young, Charles Bolden, Hoot Gibson, Rhea Seddon, Jerry Ross, and Mary Cleave.

In September 1989, Collins received a call from Duane Ross, the selection board&#x27;s administrative officer, inviting her to come to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) with the second of five groups of hopefuls for a week of interviews, examinations, medical evaluations, and orientation, commencing on 2 October 1989. Once again, her eyesight proved a problem; she failed the depth perception test, but the doctor allowed her to take an alternative test, which she passed. On 16 January 1990, she saw a note on the message board asking her to call Duane Ross. When she called she was put through to John Young, who informed her that she had been selected. When he asked if she had any questions, she asked if she was to be a pilot or a mission specialist. Young laughed and told her: &quot;Pilot! Yes, pilot. You will be the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle!&quot;
Collins&#x27;s selection as one of the twenty-three astronaut candidates (ASCANs) in NASA Astronaut Group 13 was publicly announced on 17 January 1990. The group called themselves the &quot;Hairballs&quot;. She reported for duty at JSC on 16 July 1990, after graduating from the USAF Test Pilot School. She knew one other member of the group well: Susan Helms had been a fellow assistant professor at the Air Force Academy and graduate student at Stanford. Pilot ASCANs honed their skills flying the T-38, an aircraft with which Collins was already familiar. They attended classes on the Space Shuttle and its systems, and trained in a low-fidelity simulator. Land survival training was conducted at Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington, water survival training at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, and parachute training at Vance Air Force Base. Although their training was intended to take a year, the ASCANs were moved on to operational roles after nine months. Collins was assigned to orbiter systems, with particular responsibility for the auxiliary power units.

After nine months in this assignment, Collins was sent to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida as an astronaut support person (ASP), also known as a Cape Crusader. This was another routine assignment that astronauts did to familiarize them with the Space Shuttle&#x27;s systems and procedures. ASPs handled the checkout of the systems in the hangar and on the launch pad. As members of the KSC closeout crew, they strapped the astronauts into their seats before takeoff, and helped them out again after landing. Collins spent sixteen months as an ASP, assisting with ten Space Shuttle missions between February 1992 and June 1993. After so long away from JSC, her skills in the simulator had become rusty, so the Chief of the Astronaut Office, Hoot Gibson, returned her to JSC for duty as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM).

===STS-63===

Collins first flew the Space Shuttle as pilot in 1995 aboard STS-63. This was the first time a woman had piloted the Space Shuttle. Delays in the flight schedule meant that she was the second-last member of her class to fly in space. Two more women pilots joined the Astronaut Corps in 1995 with NASA Astronaut Group 15: Pamela Melroy and Susan Still. They would be the only other women to pilot the Space Shuttle in its thirty-year history.

The STS-63 mission included a space rendezvous between the and the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. This was the first time a Space Shuttle made an approach and flyaround of &quot;Mir&quot;, although it did not dock. The crew included a cosmonaut, Vladimir Georgiyevich Titov, who had lived on &quot;Mir&quot; for a year. He became the second cosmonaut to fly on the Space Shuttle.

In preparation for the mission, Collins flew over 500 approaches and landings in the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA), a NASA training vehicle that duplicated the orbiter&#x27;s approach profile and handling qualities. The crew paid a visit to Russia and visited Star City and aircraft and spacecraft museums in the Moscow area, and sat in the cockpit of the &quot;Buran&quot; spacecraft, the Russian equivalent of the Space Shuttle. On Collins&#x27;s invitation, seven of the surviving members of the Mercury 13 attended the launch on 3 February 1995.

A series of thruster burns brought &quot;Discovery&quot; into line with &quot;Mir&quot;. The mission plan called for an approach to no less than of &quot;Mir&quot;, followed by a flyaround. This was delayed by problems with three of the orbiter&#x27;s 44 Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, which sprang leaks. Some thrusters could be shut off, but one thruster, R1U, was required for rendezvous, and could not. Eventually all its contents leaked into space and it was safe to approach &quot;Mir&quot;.

As well as rendezvousing with &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot; carried the Spacehab module and the SPARTAN-204 astronomy satellite. Collins had never experienced airsickness, but felt nauseous. This was remedied by a Phenergan shot, but she only ate Chex on the first three days, taking dinner for the first time on the fourth. Her responsibilities included running the Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-1 (FGBA-1), a Coca-Cola dispensing machine. Astronauts rated control samples before and after flight. &quot;Discovery&quot; landed back at KSC on 11 February 1995, after 8 days, 6 hours, and 28 minutes in flight.

Soon after returning from space, Collins became pregnant. Her first child, Bridget, was born nine months later.

===STS-84===

In August 1995, Collins was assigned to her second mission, STS-84. This mission would dock with &quot;Mir&quot;, leave astronaut Michael Foale behind for a four-month stay, and return with astronaut Jerry Linenger at the conclusion of his stay on &quot;Mir&quot;. Foale had been with Collins on the STS-63 mission. This time the cosmonaut on the mission would be Yelena Kondakova, who had spent 169 days on &quot;Mir&quot; between October 1994 to March 1995 as part of the &quot;Mir&quot; EO-17 mission. Collins had glimpsed her during the STS-63 mission. The mission commander, Charles Precourt, spoke Russian fluently. The crew also included a French ESA astronaut, Jean-François Clervoy.
The STS-84 mission used the , which had a reputation as the least troublesome orbiter, and for this mission carried two Spacehab modules instead of just one. In preparation for the mission, Collins completed one hundred hours of Russian language classroom training, but she usually relied on Precourt translating for her. The crew traveled to Star City to study &quot;Mir&quot;″s systems and had dinner at the home of Kondakova and her husband, cosmonaut Valeri Ryumin, now the president of Energia, the Russian space agency.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from KSC on 15 May 1997. For Collins, it was the first and only time a launch had occurred without delays. Nor were there any leaking thrusters; &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with &quot;Mir&quot; without incident the next day. This time, Collins felt no nausea. Crew members were exchanged, and of equipment, spare parts, experiments, and supplies were transferred to &quot;Mir&quot;, of which was water.

Collins spent most of the time filling bags with drinking water. She also carried out a photographic survey of the exterior of &quot;Mir&quot; through portholes on &quot;Mir&quot; and the overhead windows on &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s flight deck. The &quot;Mir&quot; EO-23 mission commander, Vasily Tsibliyev produced a small bottle of Courvoisier cognac, and everyone had a couple of sips. Alcohol consumption was banned on the Space Shuttle, but not on &quot;Mir&quot;. The rest of the mission was taken up conducting experiments. Collins photographed Comet Hale–Bopp, the brightest comet seen in the sky for many years. &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to KSC on 24 May after a flight lasting 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes.

===STS-93===

The usual practice at this time was for a pilot astronaut to fly two missions as a pilot and then go on to command a mission. Collins had heard of the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) and indicated to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, Bob Cabana, that she was interested in flying the mission to deploy it. A few months later, JSC deputy director Jim Wetherbee and director George Abbey informed her that she was to be assigned to the mission, which was designated STS-93. This would be the first time that a woman commanded a Space Shuttle mission, so the official announcement of her assignment was made by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on 5 March 1998.
Jeffrey Ashby, a rookie astronaut, was assigned as Collins&#x27;s pilot. To deploy the AXAF, she had NASA mission specialist astronaut Cady Coleman and French CNES astronaut Michel Tognini. Originally, Winston Scott was to be the second mission specialist, but NASA headquarters wanted an astronomer with experience with the inertial upper stage (IUS) that would deploy the AXAF. Steven Hawley was the only available astronaut who met both these requirements. Hawley was a very senior astronaut who had been selected with NASA Astronaut Group 8 in 1978, and had helped deploy the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and service it in 1997. Collins was apprehensive that Hawley would attempt to command the mission. Her fears proved groundless; Hawley offered wisdom and advice but made no attempt to interfere with Collins&#x27;s command of the mission.

The STS-93 mission was not routine. The had to be used because its airlock was inside the crew compartment instead of the payload bay. This meant that it was the only orbiter that could accommodate the AXAF and the IUS. Initially scheduled for January 1999, the launch date was delayed due to an investigation of a failed USAF Titan IV launch using the IUS and problems that were discovered during testing of the AXAF (now named the Chandra X-ray Observatory). This pushed the launch date back to April and then to July, when &quot;Columbia&quot; was scheduled for fifteen months&#x27; maintenance in Palmdale, California.

Because the AXAF weighed and the IUS weighed , this was the heaviest payload ever launched by the Space Shuttle. To save weight, the crew was reduced to five members, and consumables to those needed for a five-day mission. This made it the shortest scheduled mission since 1990. Two of the five pairs of tanks holding hydrogen and oxygen for the fuel cells were removed, as was the robotic arm, so any problems had to be resolved in the payload bay, as the Chandra could not be retrieved. The large mass shifted &quot;Columbia&quot;″s center of gravity, rendering a landing after an emergency abort extremely hazardous.
The launch day of 20 July 1999, coincided with the thirtieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission, so former astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins were at KSC to watch the launch. Observers also included Hillary Clinton and the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team, who had recently won the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The launch countdown proceeded smoothly until &quot;Columbia&quot;″s hazardous gas detection system highlighted an unacceptably high hydrogen concentration in the aft engine compartment, and the countdown was halted less than half a second before the Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were to have started. Had they been started, they would have had to be replaced, which would have taken a month, pushing it into the scheduled maintenance window.

There was no fuel leak; the sensor was faulty. The launch was rescheduled for two days later. It then had to be postponed a further day due to bad weather. On the third launch attempt, there was a seven-minute delay due to a communications problem, but &quot;Columbia&quot; lifted off at last on 23 July. One of the main engine controllers failed during takeoff, and one of the main engines cut out prematurely. As a result, the orbit reached was lower than intended but the situation could have been much worse; the engine problem was caused by a pin that had come loose and struck the nozzle, rupturing three liquid hydrogen coolant tubes. Had the controller not been faulty, it might have pumped more liquid oxygen and caused the engine to explode. After the flight, faults were found not just in &quot;Columbia&quot;, but in &quot;Discovery&quot; and as well, and the whole Space Shuttle fleet was grounded until December.

&quot;Columbia&quot; eventually reached the proper orbit and the Chandra X-ray Observatory was successfully deployed. For the remainder of the mission, the crew used the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS) to take ultraviolet images of the Earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter. Collins used the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) to talk to children on amateur radio stations with her call sign KD5EDS. On 27 July, Collins brought &quot;Columbia&quot; in for a night landing, the twelfth of the Space Shuttle program. The flight had lasted 4 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes. She was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission.

After a flight astronauts usually carried out a publicity tour. Collins appeared with Coleman on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on 16 August. She opened the New York Stock Exchange on 7 January 2000, and appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show on 25 April 2000. She had a miscarriage in November 1999, but a son, Luke, was born in November 2000.

===STS-114===
After the STS-84 mission, Collins had become the head of the Vehicle Systems Branch of the Astronaut Office, which she had renamed the Spacecraft Systems Branch, as the scope of its work now included the International Space Station (ISS) as well as the Space Shuttle. She relinquished this position on being assigned to command STS-93. After returning from that mission, she became the chief information officer at the Astronaut Office. In that role she automated the scheduling system, an initiative of the new Chief of the Astronaut Office, Charles Precourt. She then became the chief of the Space Shuttle Branch, remaining in this role until November 2000, when she left on maternity leave. On returning to work in January 2001, she became the chief of the Safety Branch, replacing Rick Husband, who left to command the STS-107 mission. In turn, Collins handed over the position to Dom Gorie when she was assigned to command STS-114 in late 2001.

The STS-114 mission involved docking &quot;Atlantis&quot; with the ISS to transfer crewmen and supplies. Jim Kelly was assigned as the mission&#x27;s pilot and Stephen Robinson and Japanese JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi were assigned as mission specialists. The mission would take Expedition 7 to the ISS and bring Expedition 6 back. Some of supplies would be transferred to the ISS from the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, which would then be filled with experiments, equipment that was no longer required, and garbage to be returned to Earth. Three spacewalks were scheduled, to install an external stowage platform on the ISS &quot;Quest&quot; Joint Airlock and to replace a gyroscope that had failed. Collins was concerned about the proposed workload; she knew from her experience on STS-93 that a hectic schedule and pressure to get things done often resulted in mistakes.

Problems discovered with the propellant feed lines on &quot;Atlantis&quot; and then on &quot;Discovery&quot; in June 2002 led to the entire Space Shuttle fleet being grounded again until October, pushing the launch date back to 6 March 2003. The fleet was then grounded again after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003. STS-114 now became NASA&#x27;s &quot;return to flight&quot; mission to test safety improvements in addition to resupplying the ISS. The crew remained the same, but instead of the ISS expedition crew members, STS-114 would take three additional mission specialists to handle the greater workload: Andy Thomas to coordinate the spacewalks and Wendy Lawrence to operate the robotic arm, which was equipped with specialized cameras so that the Space Shuttle could be surveyed for damage. STS-114 was already scheduled to be the next mission flown, but it is unlikely that it would have remained so if Collins and Kelly had not already flown a mission as commander and pilot respectively. Collins advocated for at least one rookie astronaut to be assigned to the flight, and Charles Camarda was added.

Rick Hauck, who had commanded the return to flight mission after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, advised her to visit the contractors where the Space Shuttle components were made. She visited the Rockwell International plant in Canoga Park, California, where the SSMEs were refurbished, the Thiokol factory in Brigham City, Utah, where the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) were made, and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the Space Shuttle external tank was assembled. Asked if she felt afraid after the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;, Collins replied: &quot;I would have to say no. I want to fly again. I am very mentally ready to go fly again.&quot; Then pausing, noting that she wanted to be precise, she added &quot;I am mentally ready to go fly again when the shuttle is cleared to fly.&quot;
She expressed reservations about the studs that held the Space Shuttle in place on the launch pad. The bolts holding them were supposed to be ruptured by explosive charges on lift off, but not all had done so on every mission; nuts had failed to rupture on one in five missions. If too many failed to separate, the result could be catastrophic. A new detonator system was devised, but would not be available for STS-114. She also had concerns about the booster separation motors that separated the SRBs from the orbiter. These were redesigned for STS-114. Finally, she expressed concern about rudder/speed brake (RSB) actuators. An inspection of the RSB actuators on &quot;Discovery&quot; revealed problems; these were rectified by taking parts from &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Since it would take a month to inspect &quot;Atlantis,&quot; &quot;Discovery&quot; was substituted for &quot;Atlantis&quot; for the STS-114 mission.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was rolled out to the launch pad on 6 April 2005, but problems with the sensors in the external tank led to it being taken back to the Vehicle Assembly Building at KSC to swap the external tank. This pushed the launch date back to 13 July. Then the same problem recurred, causing another postponement. The mission was launched on 26 July 2005, after a flawless countdown. Although &quot;Discovery&quot; was not damaged, video of the launch revealed that the problem with debris striking the Space Shuttle had not been resolved. Ten pieces of foam had broken off the external tank during liftoff, including a piece that was the largest ever recorded. This was the problem that had doomed &quot;Columbia&quot;, and it had evidently not been fixed. Collins blamed herself for not pushing Michoud harder to effect changes.

The STS-114 mission continued, as &quot;Discovery&quot; was already in orbit, but the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded again. Collins became the first astronaut to fly an orbiter through a complete 360-degree pitch maneuver. This was necessary so the astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of &quot;Discovery&quot;″s belly to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage to the orbiter upon reentry. It was a difficult maneuver, but one that she had practised many times in the simulator. She then flew under the ISS and docked with it. The inspections revealed some concerns: gap fillers were protruding between some of the tiles, which could cause them to pop out during re-entry. The three spacewalks and the transfer of supplies were carried out without problems. On the third spacewalk, Robinson rode the robotic arm to the underside of &quot;Discovery&quot; and removed the two most prominent protruding gap fillers.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was supposed to land at KSC on 8 August but unfavorable weather led to a postponement until the next day, and the landing site was changed to Edwards Air Force Base. &quot;Discovery&quot; touched down after a mission lasting 13 days, 21 hours, and 33 minutes. This time, Collins was unhappy with her landing, feeling that it was slightly fast. She was relieved to find that the tires were in good shape. Although she had felt well in space on this mission, her feet hurt as the bones moved back into position back on the ground, and the pain took two weeks to subside.

==Later life==

Collins retired from the U.S. Air Force in January 2005 with the rank of colonel. On 1 May 2006, NASA announced that she was leaving NASA to spend more time with her family and pursue other interests. She had flown 6,751 hours in thirty different types of aircraft, and logged over 872 hours in space flights.

After her retirement from the USAF and NASA, Collins served on the Board of Directors of USAA, a San Antonio banking and insurance company, from 2006 to 2021. She remained involved with NASA, as chair of the Space Operations Committee of the NASA Advisory Council from 2007 to 2011.

Collins also made occasional public appearances as an analyst covering Shuttle launches and landings for CNN. She was the commencement speaker at the 148th commencement of Syracuse University in May 2001. She addressed the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, on 20 July 2016, leading to speculation that Donald Trump might appoint her NASA administrator.

==Awards and honors==
As well as USAF Command Pilot (Astronaut) wings, Collins&#x27;s awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with an oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Commendation Medal with an oak leaf cluster, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and four NASA Space Flight Medals. She received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2001, the Free Spirit Award, National Space Trophy, and Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2006, the Space Foundation Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in 2007, the Harmon Trophy in 2020, and the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy in 2022.

Collins was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall Of Fame in 1995, the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2009, the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame on 19 April 2013, and the Texas Aviation Hall Of Fame at the Lone Star Flight Museum in Houston, Texas, on 6 May 2020. She was recognized by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as one of 300 women who have changed the world.

An astronomical observatory—the Eileen Collins Observatory run by Corning Community College—is named in her honor, as is the main entrance boulevard to Syracuse Hancock International Airport. One of her graduate school alma maters, Webster University, awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science in 1996, and in 2021, she received Syracuse University&#x27;s highest alumni honor, the George Arents Award. University College Dublin of the National University of Ireland also conferred an honorary Doctor of Science degree on her on 14 June 2006. She was awarded with Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy in 2022.

<text>The Carians (; , &quot;Kares&quot;, plural of , &quot;Kar&quot;) were the ancient inhabitants of Caria in southwest Anatolia, who spoke the Carian language.

==Historical accounts==
=== Karkisa ===

It is not clear when the Carians enter into history. The definition is dependent on corresponding Caria and the Carians to the &quot;Karkiya&quot; or &quot;Karkisa&quot; mentioned in the Hittite records. Bronze Age Karkisa are first mentioned as having aided the Assuwa League against the Hittite King Tudhaliya I. Later in 1323 BC, King Arnuwandas II was able to write to Karkiya for them to provide asylum for the deposed Manapa-Tarhunta of &quot;the land of the Seha River&quot;, one of the principalities within the Luwian Arzawa complex in western Anatolia. This they did, allowing Manapa-Tarhunta to take back his kingdom. In 1274 BC, Karkisa are also mentioned among those who fought on the Hittite Empire side against the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh. Taken as a whole, Hittite records seem to point at a Luwian ancestry for the Carians and, as such, they would have lost their literacy through the Dark Age of Anatolia.

The relationship between the Bronze Age &quot;Karkiya&quot; or &quot;Karkisa&quot; and the Iron Age Caria and the Carians is complicated, despite having western Anatolia as common ground, by the uncertainties regarding the exact location of the former on the map within Hittite geography. Yet, the supposition is suitable from a linguistic point-of-view given that the Phoenicians were calling them &quot;KRK&quot; in their abjad script and they were referred to as in Old Persian.

=== Homer ===
The Carians next appear in records of the early centuries of the first millennium BC; Homer&#x27;s writing about the golden armour or ornaments of the Carian captain Nastes, the brother of Amphimachus and son of Nomion, reflects the reputation of Carian wealth that may have preceded the Greek Dark Ages and thus recalled in oral tradition.

=== Old Testament ===
In some translations of Biblical texts, the Carians are mentioned in 2 Kings 11:4 and 19 (; כָּרִי, in Hebrew, literally &quot;like fat sheep/goat&quot;, contextually &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;honored&quot;), and perhaps alluded to in 2 Samuel 8:18, 15:18, and 20:23 (; כְּרֵתִי, probably unrelated due to the &quot;t&quot;, may be Cretans). They are also named as mercenaries in inscriptions found in ancient Egypt and Nubia, dated to the reigns of Psammetichus I and II. They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cari&quot; or &quot;Khari&quot;. Carian remnants have been found in the ancient city of Persepolis or modern Takht-e-Jamshid in Iran.

=== Greek and Roman Antiquity ===
The Greek historian Herodotus recorded that Carians themselves believed to be aborigines of Caria but they were also, by general consensus of ancient sources, a maritime people before being gradually pushed inland. Plutarch mentions the Carians as being referred to as &quot;cocks&quot; by the Persians on account of their wearing crests on their helmets; the epithet was expressed in the form of a Persian privilege when a Carian soldier responsible for killing Cyrus the Younger was rewarded by Artaxerxes II (r. 405/404–359/358 BC) with the honor of leading the Persian army with a golden cock on the point of his spear.

According to Thucydides, it was largely the Carians who settled the Cyclades prior to the Minoans. The Middle Bronze Age (MMI–MMII) expansion of the Minoans into this region seems to have come at their expense. Intending to secure revenue in the Cyclades, Minos of Knossos established a navy with which he established his first colonies by taking control of the Hellenic sea and ruling over the Cyclades. In doing so, Minos expelled the Carians, many of which had turned to piracy as a way of life. During the Athenian purification of Delos, all graves were exhumed and it was found that more than half were Carians (identified by the style of arms and the method of interment).

According to Strabo, Carians, of all the &quot;barbarians&quot;, had a particular tendency to intermingle with the Greeks,
&quot;This was particularly the case with the Carians, for, although the other peoples were not yet having very much intercourse with the Greeks nor even trying to live in Hellenic fashion or to learn our language ... yet the Carians roamed throughout the whole of Greece serving on expeditions for pay. ... and when they were driven thence [from the islands] into Asia, even here they were unable to live apart from the Greeks, I mean when the Ionians and Dorians later crossed over to Asia.&quot; (Strabo 14.2.28)

Indeed, the term barbarian was coined by Homer in reference to the Carians speaking an unintelligible language.

==Greek mythology==
According to Herodotus, the Carians were named after an eponymous Car, a legendary early king and a brother of Lydus and Mysus, also eponymous founders respectively of Lydians and Mysians and all sons of Atys.

Homer records that Miletus (later an Ionian city), together with the mountain of Phthries, the river Maeander and the crests of Mount Mycale were held by the Carians at the time of the Trojan War and that the Carians, qualified by the poet as being of incomprehensible speech, joined the Trojans against the Achaeans under the leadership of Nastes, brother of Amphimachos (&quot;he who fights both ways&quot;) and son of Nomion. These figures appear only in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and in a list in Dares of Phrygia&#x27;s epitome of the Trojan War.

Classical Greeks would often claim that part of Caria to the north was originally colonized by Ionian Greeks before the Dorians.

The Greek goddess Hecate possibly originated among the Carians. Indeed, most theophoric names invoking Hecate, such as Hecataeus or Hecatomnus, the father of Mausolus, are attested in Caria.

==Carians and Leleges==
The Carians were often linked by Greek writers to the Leleges, but the exact nature of the relationship between Carians and Leleges remains mysterious. The two groups seem to have been distinct, but later intermingled with each other. Strabo wrote that they were so intermingled that they were often confounded with each other. However, Athenaeus stated that the Leleges stood in relation to the Carians as the Helots stood to the Lacedaemonians. This confusion of the two peoples is found also in Herodotus, who wrote that the Carians, when they were allegedly living amid the Cyclades, were known as &quot;Leleges&quot;.
==Language==
The Carian language belongs to the Luwic group of the Anatolian family of languages. Other Luwic languages besides Luwian proper are Lycian and Milyan (Lycian B). Although the ancestors of Carian and Lycian must have been very close to Luwian, it is probably incorrect to claim that they are linear descendants of Luwian. It is possible that the speakers of Proto-Carian, or the common ancestor of Carian and Lycian, supplied the elites of the Bronze Age kingdom of Arzawa, the population of which partly consisted of Lydians.

An important evidence of the Carians&#x27; own belief in their blood ties and cultural affinity with the Lydians and Mysians is the admittance, apart from theirs, exclusively of Lydians and Mysians to the temple of the &quot;Carian Zeus&quot; in their first capital that was Mylasa.

==Religion==
One of the Carian ritual centers was Mylasa, where they worshipped their supreme god, called &quot;the Carian Zeus&quot; by Herodotus. Unlike Zeus, this was a warrior god.

It is possible that the goddess Hecate, the patron of pathways and crossroads, originated among the Carians. Herodotus calls her Athena and says that her priestess would grow a beard when disaster pended.

On Mount Latmos near Miletus, the Carians worshipped Endymion, who was the lover of the Moon and fathered fifty children. Endymion slept eternally, in the sanctuary devoted to him, which lasted into Roman times.

There is at least one named priestess known to us from this region, Carminia Ammia who was priestess of Thea Maeter Adrastos and of Aphrodite.

==Archaeology==
Throughout the 1950s, J.M. Cook and G.E. Bean conducted exhaustive archaeological surveys in Caria. Cook ultimately concluded that Caria was virtually devoid of any prehistoric remains. According to his reports, third millennium finds were mostly confined to a few areas on or near the Aegean coast. No finds from the second millennium were known aside from the Submycenean remains at Asarlik and the Mycenaean remains at Miletus and near Mylasa. Archaeologically, there was nothing distinguishing about the Carians since the material evidence so far only indicated that their culture was merely a reflection of Greek culture.

During the 1970s, further archaeological excavations in Caria revealed Mycenean buildings at Iasus (with two &quot;Minoan&quot; levels underneath them), as well as Protogeometric and Geometric material remains (i.e. cemeteries and pottery). Archaeologists also confirmed the presence of Carians in Sardis, Rhodes, and in Egypt where they served as mercenaries of the Pharaoh. In Rhodes, specifically, a type of Carian chamber-tomb known as a &quot;Ptolemaion&quot; may be attributed to a period of Carian hegemony on the island. Despite this period of increased archaeological activity, the Carians still appear not to have been an autochthonous group of Anatolia since both the coastal and interior regions of Caria were virtually unoccupied throughout prehistoric times.

As for the assumption that the Carians descended from Neolithic settlers, this is contradicted by the fact that Neolithic Caria was essentially desolate. Though a very small Neolithic population may have existed in Caria, the people known as &quot;Carians&quot; may in fact have been of Aegean origin that settled in southwestern Anatolia during the second millennium BC.

<text>The A5, the London-Holyhead trunk road, is a major road in England and Wales. It runs for about from London to the Irish Sea at the ferry port of Holyhead. In many parts the route follows that of the Roman Iter II route which later took the Anglo-Saxon name Watling Street.

==History==
===Roman road===

The section of the A5 between London and Shrewsbury is roughly contiguous with one of the principal Roman roads in Britain: that between &quot;Londinium&quot; (modern-day London) and &quot;Deva&quot; (modern-day Chester), which diverges from the present-day A5 corridor at Wroxeter (&quot;Viroconium Cornoviorum&quot;) near Shrewsbury.

===Telford&#x27;s Holyhead Road===


The Act of Union 1800, which unified Great Britain and Ireland, gave rise to a need to improve communication links between London and Dublin. A parliamentary committee led to an act of Parliament, the (55 Geo. 3. c. 152) that authorised the purchase of existing turnpike road interests and, where necessary, the construction of new road, to complete the route between the two capitals. This made it the first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since Roman times. Responsibility for establishing the new route was awarded to the famous engineer, Thomas Telford.

Through England, the road largely took over existing turnpike roads and mainly following the route of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Wæcelinga Stræt&quot; (Watling Street), much of which had been historically the Roman road &quot;Iter II&quot;. However between Weedon, Northamptonshire and Oakengates, Telford&#x27;s Holyhead Road eschews the Watling Street corridor, picking up instead the major cities of Coventry, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton; this routing being far more useful for communications.

From Shrewsbury and through Wales, Telford&#x27;s work was more extensive. In places he followed existing roads, but he also built new links, including the Menai Suspension Bridge to connect the mainland with Anglesey and the Stanley Embankment to Holy Island.

Telford&#x27;s road was complete with the opening of the Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826, which had been authorised by the (59 Geo. 3. c. 48).

====Notable features of Telford&#x27;s road====
The road was designed to allow stagecoaches and the mail coach to carry post between London and Holyhead, and thence by mailboat to Ireland. Therefore, throughout its length the gradient never exceeds 1:17 (5.9%).

The route through Wales retains many of the original features of Telford&#x27;s road and has, since 1995, been recognised as a historic route worthy of preservation. An 18-month survey by Cadw in 19982000 revealed that about 40% of the original road and its ancillary features survives under the modern A5, much more than previously thought. These features include the following:
* many surviving and distinctive toll houses
* &#x27;depots&#x27; along the route, being roadside alcoves to store grit and materials
* distinctive milestones at each mile – many originals having survived and been restored, others now replaced by replicas
* distinctive gates in a &#x27;sunburst&#x27; design, a few of which have survived
* a weighbridge at Lon Isaf, between Bangor and Bethesda

====Tŷ Nant cutting====
In 1997, a section of bends on Telford&#x27;s road between Tŷ Nant and Dinmael was by-passed by a modern cutting. However, investigation in 2006 revealed that the rock face in the cutting had become unstable, and the A5 was closed from the end of May 2006. Traffic was diverted onto the old A5 route, on a stretch known as the Glyn Bends, while the rock face was made safe. This involved the removal of 230,000 tonnes of rock and alluvial deposits. In July 2007, the A5 through the reconstructed cutting was reopened.

==Route==
===London–Milton Keynes===
Starting at Marble Arch in London, the A5 runs northwest on the Edgware Road through Kilburn and Cricklewood. The A5 number disappears at the A41 near Edgware but the original road continues as the A5183 through Elstree, Radlett, St Albans, Redbourn and Dunstable. A few miles north of Dunstable, the A5 regains its identity at the M1 motorway junction 11A, rejoining the old Roman Road and passing through Hockliffe before becoming a dual carriageway as it approaches Milton Keynes.

===Milton Keynes–Hinckley===
On entering the City of Milton Keynes, the road becomes an (almost) fully grade-separated dual carriageway and passes through Milton Keynes. This stretch was opened in 1980, replacing the original route along Watling Street. From just north of the city, after entering Northamptonshire, the road resumes as a single carriageway that continues through Towcester where it crosses the A43 dual carriageway just north of the town. The road accompanies the Grand Union Canal and the M1 motorway through the Watford Gap. It then bridges the M45 motorway and continues to Kilsby. As it passes close to Rugby, the road is diverted slightly around the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal and then passes the remains of the Rugby Radio Station.

The next phase north-west-bound takes it under the M6 motorway and passing close to Lutterworth. Along this stretch, the road frequently alternates between being a single and a dual carriageway. After meeting the M69 motorway at a roundabout, with the motorway passing above, the A5 runs between Nuneaton and Hinckley.

===Hinckley–Shrewsbury===
After this section the road continues to run through the northern fringes of Nuneaton and then on to Tamworth. At Tamworth, the road follows a more recent dual carriageway bypass, permitting the original alignment to become a local road in the town. From this point the road is a grade separated dual carriageway up until its junction with the A38 and M6 toll. After this junction it passes just to the south of Cannock and then, after its final junction with the A41, enters Telford, where it loses its identity and route-shares with the M54 motorway from junction 5. At junction 7 the motorway ends and the A5 continues to Shrewsbury as dual carriageway, on its new alignment. (The original route through Telford, and then via Atcham to Shrewsbury, is unclassified through Oakengates and as the B5061 through Wellington and the B4380 through Atcham). Continuing from the end of the M54, the route runs around Shrewsbury as the town&#x27;s southern bypass (still as dual carriageway), combining for a stretch with the A49. (The route once ran through the town, but was first bypassed in the 1930s, then by-passed again in the early 1990s).

===Shrewsbury–Bangor===
After Shrewsbury, the A5 continues as single-carriageway except for the Nesscliffe bypass. It then multiplexes with the major South Wales North Wales road A483 and forms part of the Oswestry bypass, running to the east of that town. Shortly after, it crosses the River Ceiriog and enters Wales to continue from Chirk. The A5 continues through to Snowdonia via Llangollen, Corwen, Capel Curig and through the centre of Bangor.

===Bangor–Holyhead===
From Bangor the road crosses the Menai Suspension Bridge to Anglesey and then runs roughly parallel to the A55 expressway to the outskirts of the village of Valley where the A5 continues onto the Stanley Embankment. The A5 from Valley to Holyhead is named London Road running through to the Port of Holyhead. The A5 traditionally terminated at Admiralty Arch (1822–24) on Salt Island, which was designed by Thomas Harrison to commemorate a visit by King George IV in 1821 en route to Ireland and marks the zenith of Irish Mail coach operations. The A5 currently terminates at the junction of the A55 near the Port of Holyhead.

==Road safety==
In June 2008, a stretch of the A5 between Daventry and Rugby was named as the most dangerous road in the East Midlands. This single carriageway stretch had 15 fatal and serious injury collisions between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as &#x27;red&#x27;the second highest risk bandin the EuroRAP report published by the Road Safety Foundation.

<text>Fulgence Charpentier, OC (June 29, 1897 – February 6, 2001) was a French Canadian journalist, editor and publisher.

Born in Sainte-Anne-de-Prescott, Ontario, Charpentier&#x27;s career included diplomatic, political and bureaucratic positions, but his first love had been journalism ever since he began his reporting career at Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Le Devoir&quot; in 1915, during which he earned $20 a week.

In 1918, Charpentier joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force, but the war ended before he could be sent overseas. He stayed in the army after the Armistice to work in a military hospital on the campus of McGill University in Montreal.

Charpentier began covering Parliament for Ottawa&#x27;s &quot;Le Droit&quot; (the city&#x27;s largest newspaper) in 1922. He got the job because his father built &quot;Le Droit&quot;&#x27;s first offices. The newspaper sent him to law school in Toronto for two academic years before he began his parliamentary reporting.

Charpentier was the longest-serving member of the Parliamentary Press Gallery. His early stories on the then-unilingual English environment of Parliament were believed to be instrumental in getting federal authorities to increase the visibility of French in the Canadian public service. Over the course of his career, Charpentier also wrote for Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; and Quebec City&#x27;s &quot;Le Soleil&quot;.

He was also head of the French section of the Canadian Censorship Branch through most of the Second World War, assuming full control of the Censorship Branch in January 1945, when chief censor Wilfrid Eggleston resigned. He was appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;Le Droit&quot; following his diplomatic career in 1968 at the age of 71.

His resume included serving as a media spokesman for ambassador Georges Vanier in Paris and working as a diplomat from 1946 until 1968 in some francophone African nations and South America. While serving in Africa, Charpentier met Dr. Albert Schweitzer and became an advocate for his work.

Charpentier was still writing weekly columns on his trusty typewriter for &quot;Le Droit&quot; until 1999, when he had to stop due to chronic bronchial pneumonia at the age of 101. The Canadian Parliamentary Press gallery held a celebration for him shortly after Charpentier&#x27;s retirement.

In 1978, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1998.
He died at age 103 of pneumonia on February 6, 2001.

Charpentier served on the Ottawa Board of Control, and ran for mayor in 1935, but lost.

<text>TaleSpin is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It first aired in 1990 as a preview-run on The Disney Channel before beginning its main run in syndication later that year as part of the programming block The Disney Afternoon. It features anthropomorphized versions of characters adapted from Disney&#x27;s 1967 animated feature &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which was theatrically rereleased in the summer before this show premiered in the fall, notably Baloo the Bear, Louie the orangutan, and Shere Khan the tiger, along with new characters created for the show. The name of the show is a play on &quot;tailspin&quot;, the rapid descent of an aircraft in a steep spiral, and on the fact that &quot;tale&quot; is another word for &quot;story&quot;. The show is one of nine &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; shows to use established Disney characters as the main characters, with the other eight being &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, &quot;Bonkers&quot;, &quot;Quack Pack&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;. It is also one of two animated television series based on the book &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, the second being &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;.

A reboot of the series from Point Grey Pictures is in development for Disney+

==Background==
===Development===
The series was largely developed by writers Jymn Magon and Mark Zaslove, who were also the supervising producers on the series as well as story editors. There were four production teams, each one headed by a producer/director: Robert Taylor, Larry Latham, Jamie Mitchell, and Ed Ghertner.

Initially, Disney simply commissioned Magon and Zaslove with creating a thirty-minute animated program for them, with no requirements as to what the show should be about. Nearing the deadline for a pitch without having come up with anything, Magon hit upon the idea of making the story about Baloo, one of the central characters of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which had recently been theatrically rereleased. The show &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; was an inspiration according to creator/supervising producer, Jymn Magon. Similar to the main character in that show, they decided to have Baloo work for an air cargo delivery service, a concept also occasionally featured on Disney&#x27;s successful &quot;DuckTales&quot;. In order to add dramatic tension, they decided to maintain the impressionable son / bad father dynamic which had driven part of the plot of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, replacing the human Mowgli with the anthropomorphic bear Kit. Inspired by &quot;Cheers&quot; — then one of the most popular programs on television — Magon and Zaslove created the character Rebecca (voiced by actress Sally Struthers), basing her on the character Rebecca Howe and giving her that character&#x27;s arc of being an intelligent and headstrong yet inexperienced manager put in charge of a fledgling business. Deciding to make the show a period piece, the pair lastly decided to make one of the show&#x27;s primary locations a neutral zone inspired by Rick Blaine&#x27;s bar in &quot;Casablanca&quot;, where they inserted the character of Louie in place of Rick. The decision to add Shere Khan to the cast was not made until later in the show&#x27;s development. Magon and Zaslove also took inspiration from Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 1989 manga &quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot;, about a pigheaded man who flies a seaplane and fights air pirates. Two years after &quot;TaleSpin&quot; premiered, Miyazaki released an anime adaptation called &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, which Zaslove felt took cues from &quot;TaleSpin&quot;. Phil Harris, who voiced Baloo for the film, was initially hired to reprise the role; at age 85, however, Harris had lost some of his comic timing and had to be chauffeured from his home in Palm Springs for each recording session. His work was discarded and Ed Gilbert took over the role for the rest of the series.

Famed Uncle Scrooge comic writer and artist Don Rosa wrote episode 6, &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea Duck&quot;, and episode 9, &quot;I Only Have Ice for You&quot;.

The series was animated by Walt Disney Animation (Japan) Inc., Hanho Heung-Up Co., Ltd., Jade Animation, Tama Productions, Walt Disney Animation (France) S.A., Sunwoo Entertainment, and Wang Film Productions.

Gilbert would continue to voice Baloo in other Disney projects, commercials, promos, miscellaneous, until his death.

Harris, who continued to do occasional voice acting until 1991, died of a heart attack on August 11, 1995, five years after &quot;TaleSpin&quot; premiered. Three years later, in August 1998, Gilbert fell ill from lung cancer and never recovered, and died on May 8, 1999, nine years after &quot;TaleSpin&quot; premiered.

===Broadcast===
After a preview-run of &quot;TaleSpin&quot; aired on The Disney Channel from May 5 to July 15, 1990, the series began its main syndicated run in September of the same year. The original concept was embodied in the pilot episode and introductory television movie &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot; which was the sole nominee for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming More Than One Hour) in 1991. After its premiere on September 7, 1990, &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot; was re-edited into four half-hour episodes for reruns. The show was often seen either on its own as a half-hour show, or as part of the two-hour syndicated programming block &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;. &quot;TaleSpin&quot; ended on its 65th episode which aired on August 8, 1991, but reruns continued to be shown on &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; until September 1994. On October 2, 1995, &quot;TaleSpin&quot; began reruns on The Disney Channel as part of a two-hour programming block called &quot;Block Party&quot; which aired on weekdays in the late-afternoon/early-evening and which also included &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;. Later, the show was aired on Toon Disney, where it was first aired from April 1998 until January 2006 (with a hiatus between 2001 and 2002) and later from January 2007 until May 2008. Throughout its broadcast history, the series has been subjected to numerous edits.

==Synopsis==
&quot;TaleSpin&quot; is set in the fictional city of Cape Suzette (a pun on the dish Crêpe Suzette). The city lies on an unnamed island, in an unspecified body of water, on a large harbor or bay enclosed by a high cliff wall. A single cleft in the wall is the harbor&#x27;s only means of access. The cleft is guarded by anti-aircraft artillery, preventing flying rabble-rousers or air pirates from entering the city. The characters in the world of &quot;TaleSpin&quot; are anthropomorphic animals, though normal wild and domestic animals exist as well. The time frame of the series is never specifically addressed, but the helicopter, television, and jet engine are experimental devices. In the episode &quot;Bygones&quot;, Baloo comments that &quot;The Great War ended 20 years ago&quot;, thus suggesting that the series takes place around 1938. Radio is the primary mass medium and the episode &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Molly&quot; briefly alludes to the characters having never heard of television.

The series centers on the adventures of bush pilot Baloo the bear, whose air cargo freight business &quot;Baloo&#x27;s Air Service&quot; is taken up by Rebecca Cunningham who has a young daughter named Molly. Upon his default on delinquent bills with the bank and his perceived irresponsibility in running a business by Rebecca, she takes over the business and renames it &quot;Higher for Hire&quot;, making her Baloo&#x27;s boss. An orphan boy and former air pirate, the ambitious grizzly bear cub Kit Cloudkicker, attaches to Baloo and becomes his navigator. He sometimes calls Baloo &quot;Papa Bear&quot;. Together, they are the crew of Higher for Hire&#x27;s only aircraft, a 20-year-old modified Conwing L-16 (a fictitious twin-boom cargo plane using elements from the Fairchild C-82 transport, Grumman G-21 Goose amphibian, and a Consolidated PBY-3) named the &quot;Sea Duck&quot;. The series follows the ups and downs of Higher for Hire and its staff, sometimes in the vein of old action-adventure film serials of the 1930s and 1940s, like the &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; films, and contemporary variations, such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

Their adventures often involve encounters with a gang of air pirates led by Don Karnage, as well as with representatives of Thembria, inhabited by anthropomorphic boars, or other, often even stranger obstacles. There is no equivalent of the Nazis in the series, although one story in &quot;Disney Adventures Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Dogs of War!&quot;, had the heroes encounter members of the &quot;Houn&quot; nationality, a menacing militaristic nationality of dogs from &quot;Hounsland&quot; who wear uniforms that are based on German ones and who speak in a mock-German accent.

The relationship between Baloo and Rebecca owes something to the screwball comedy films of the Great Depression. More precisely, according to Jymn Magon (co-creator of the series), the two characters were fashioned after Sam Malone and Rebecca Howe from the then-popular sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;.

There is no confirmation on whether these episodes will be released, along with the final 11 episodes of the series.
====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom had only two releases, each containing 3 discs per set, the sets do skip over episodes that were present on the North American sets. The first collection came out on February 11, 2013 and the second collection was released on May 20 of the same year.
====Australia====
The sets from Germany and the United Kingdom have also been released in Australia. The first collection came out on August 17, 2012. The second collection was released on March 15, 2013, followed by the third on October 11 of the same year.
====India====
In India, &quot;TaleSpin&quot; was dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu for TV broadcast in the 90s along with &quot;DuckTales&quot;. In 2012, 63 Hindi dubbed episodes out of the total 65 episodes were released by Disney India on 21 DVD volumes in PAL format. These discs support DVD Region 2, Region 4 and Region 5, but due to limited number of copies, they quickly went out of stock. Each DVD contained only 3 episodes.

===Video on demand===
The entire series is currently available for purchase in standard definition on Amazon Prime Video and the iTunes Store in the United States.

As of November 12, 2019, the series is available to stream on Disney+, with the exception of the banned episodes &quot;Last Horizons&quot; and &quot;Flying Dupes&quot;.

==Reception==
IGN listed &quot;TaleSpin&quot; as the 81st best cartoon in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.

==Reboot==
A &quot;TaleSpin&quot; reboot is in development for Disney+. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg will executive produce the project via Point Grey Pictures. Jymn Magon and Mark Zaslove revealed that he is involved in the reboot series as a creative consultant.

==Comics==
A monthly comic book based on the show was published by the Disney subsidiary W. D. Publications, Inc. as part of their Disney Comics line in 1991, running for eleven issues, including a four-issue limited series called &quot;Take Off&quot; based on the series premiere episode &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot;, which was published between January and April, followed by a series of seven regular issues published between June and December. Bobbi J.G. Weiss was the writer for regular issues 1–4 and 6–7, while &quot;Take Off&quot; was adapted from &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot; and regular issue 5 was adapted from episode 35, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea Duck&quot;, for both of which Weiss is credited for adaptation.

The comic&#x27;s cancellation at the end of 1991 terminated several planned stories that would have revealed pieces of background for the main characters. This one seems to be an exception though: issue #7, &quot;The Long Flight Home&quot;, explored Kit&#x27;s past, and how he joined up with the pirates. According to the letter page in #3, a planned story for the comic&#x27;s annual would have explored the origin of the &quot;Iron Vulture&quot;. In addition, #4–7 would have letters &#x27;answered&#x27; by the characters. A collected edition called &quot;Disney&#x27;s Cartoon Tales&quot; featuring &quot;TaleSpin&quot; came out in 1991 (). It reprints #4 and 6 from the regular comic book series. Subsequent comic stories were also printed in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; from 1990 to 1995, and then re-appeared in the Summer 2006 issue of &quot;Disney Adventures Comic Zone Magazine&quot;, as well as in &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; comic book published by Marvel Comics.

Although issue #8 of the monthly comic series never made it to print, the end of issue #7 included a preview for it: &quot;Spies in Cape Suzette?! There are some mighty mysterious folk sniffing around Shere Khan Industries. When Special Agent Booker shows up to handle the problem he finds that battling foreign agents is easier than dealing with Baloo as an assistant in... THE SPY WHO BUGGED ME!&quot;

==Video games==
Three different &quot;TaleSpin&quot; video games were produced. One game was a scrolling shooting game published by Capcom for the NES and Game Boy. The other two were platform games; one developed by Sega for the Genesis and Game Gear, and the other by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16. Rebecca, Kit, Baloo, Don Karnage and Shere Khan from &quot;Talespin&quot; also appeared on cards in the 1993 puzzle game &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Memory Challenge&quot;, released for Amiga and MS-DOS compatible operating systems, developed by Infogrames.

===TailSpin (&quot;War Thunder&quot; parody game)===
Although not an official &quot;TaleSpin&quot; game, Gaijin&#x27;s &quot;War Thunder&quot; 2021 April Fools&#x27; Day event called &quot;TailSpin&quot; is apparently related to or inspired by the show.

This became a game mode for &quot;War Thunder&quot; again from March 10–30, 2022.

====Content====
A number of aircraft in the game appear to be inspired by those in the original show. Players start with the &quot;Nimble&quot; biplane seaplane fighter, and progress to more advanced aircraft by shooting down or getting &quot;assists&quot; on shooting down enemy aircraft, until reaching the mighty &quot;Sly Duck&quot; seaplane (which closely resembles the &quot;Sea Duck&quot; from the show). The game also includes a &quot;Bear&quot; pilot icon resembling Baloo and a &quot;Fox&quot; pilot icon. Every aircraft in the event besides the &quot;Nimble&quot; is from &quot;TaleSpin&quot; or heavily based on one seen in the show.

Gameplay is air arcade, and players are randomly allocated to a side. Both sides have the same aircraft.

Other content includes:
* Airship aircraft carriers. 
* Custom muzzle flash, tracer, explosion, fire and smoke effects. 
* A dragged art style combined with a hard gloss on all aircraft which glint when they are in the sun. 
* A floating airborne map reminiscent of Ming the Merciless&#x27; cloud empire from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; or &quot;Avatar&quot;.

==Cameos and parodies==

* &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1992): In the episode &quot;Film Flam&quot;, the front of Darkwing Duck&#x27;s uniform is ripped open, revealing the &quot;TaleSpin&quot; logo on the shirt he wears underneath.
* &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; (1992): In the episode &quot;Sheerluck Bonkers / All Potato Network / The Puck Stops Here&quot;, Don Karnage hosts the episode, teaches viewers how to look for treasure, finds a lunchbox with a picture of Baloo on it, and sword fights with Captain Hook.
* &quot;Bonkers&quot; (1993–1994): In the episode &quot;Of Mice and Menace&quot;, Shere Khan appears in a mugshot.
* &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994–1995): In the episode &quot;When Chaos Comes Calling&quot;, there is a scene where the Genie transforms into a figure resembling and dressed like Baloo and is flying the &quot;Sea Duck&quot;, while Iago is dressed like Kit Cloudkicker, Jasmine has Rebecca Cunningham&#x27;s clothes and hairstyle, and Abu is dressed like Louie.
* &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (2014): In the episode &quot;Batman Forever 21&quot;, Baloo is seen in the jungle with Mowgli and Bagheera, where he has dreams of his former life as a bush pilot, only to find out he was one and was forced into a life as a &#x27;lazy bear&#x27;. Only Louie and Rebecca know, whereas Bagheera is hired to hide the fact. Kit Cloudkicker is only shown in flashbacks.
* &quot;Pickle and Peanut&quot; (2016): The episode &quot;90&#x27;s Adventure Bear&quot; parodies &quot;TaleSpin&quot; with the title character being a stand-in for Baloo that leads a team consisting of characters based on King Louie and Kit as well as fellow Disney Afternoon characters Gadget and Zipper. An over-the-hill star of a long-ended show, 90&#x27;s Adventure Bear has become bitter in his retirement and laments the show&#x27;s lack of a DVD release, reflecting the incomplete status of many Disney Afternoon DVD releases.
* &quot;DuckTales&quot; (2017): In the premiere episode &quot;Woo-oo!&quot;, Dewey Duck mentions Cape Suzette while trying to take his uncle Donald Duck&#x27;s boat for a joyride and a newspaper in the episode references air pirates. Don Karnage and his Sky Pirates make appearances in the episodes &quot;Sky Pirates...In the Sky!&quot;, &quot;GlomTales!&quot;, &quot;The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker!&quot;, and &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot;, voiced by Jaime Camil. In addition, adult versions of Kit Cloudkicker (voiced by Adam Pally) and Molly Cunningham (voiced by Eliza Coupe) also appear in &quot;The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker!&quot; and &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot;, along with a cameo by Baloo in a Higher for Hire commercial in the former.
* &quot;War Thunder&quot; (2021): In an update published on April 1, 2021, as an April Fools&#x27; Day event, &quot;War Thunder&quot; introduced a limited time availability game mode called &quot;TailSpin&quot;, which takes artistic inspiration from the &quot;TaleSpin&quot; cartoon series.
* &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; (2022): During the Fancon event portrayed in the film, Baloo is a guest of honor who performs &quot;Bare Necessities&quot;. Both the announcer of said show and Dale mention that Baloo was part of the Disney Afternoon only for him to return to the spotlight in 2016. During the end credits, a poster for &quot;Disney Afternoon Fight Fest&quot; is shown that includes art of Baloo, Kit Cloudkicker and Rebecca.

==Award==
* Emmy Award
** 1991 – &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming More Than One Hour)&quot; – Jymn Magon, Larry Latham, Robert Taylor, Mark Zaslove, Alan Burnett, and Len Uhley for &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot; (juried award; did not receive enough votes to win).

<text>In pre-Columbian Mayan civilization, ceremonial dance had great importance. However, since dance is a transient art, it is inherently difficult for archeologists to find and evaluate evidence of its role. There is little material information left behind, beyond a few paintings on murals and vases. This lack of direct evidence leads to several different archaeological interpretations.

Dance was a central component of social, religious, and political endeavors for the ancient Maya. The entire community danced, including kings, nobles, and common people. Dance served many functions such as creating sacred space, closing the gap between here and the otherworld, and releasing the dead from the grasp of the Xibalbans (see Xibalba).

==Overview==
Dance from pre-Columbian Maya culture still exists in various altered forms today. However, dancing in the ancient world carried a much deeper significance in their sophisticated culture. Records of these dances have come to light through various murals, codices, and especially the Spaniards who first recorded their observations. 
Spirits of the super-natural world and their relationship with Maya culture played an important role in ritual dance. Just as well, beasts were usually mimicked in ceremonial dance. The attire worn to some dances as depicted in murals show the links Maya dancers make to the natural world and to their worshipped gods who often took the form of animals. This is evident especially in the frescoes of Bonampak.
The elements as well were worshipped through Maya dance. In the Tzutujil Maya culture, it was believed that a spirit controlled the power of volcanoes. When the mountain began to grumble and shake, the Tzutujil priests would pick young women and girls who would partake in a large dance ceremony before being sacrificed into the burning mountain. Maya dance rituals often included sacrifice. For instance, the Tun-teleche¬ dance included victims whose hearts were removed before they died as a gift to underworld demons. On the other hand, some public ritual dances were even erotic in nature. Common throughout most all dances though was the importance of deities and the relationship between man and god. 
Dancing includes many different aspects of other rituals into the moves and actions they do during them. Blood-letting was used to help demonstrate the bravery of the warriors. They would also put their captives in their dances; the captives would be killed in a public ritual normally after the bloodletting. Ball games were also involved in dances. Some ball players would be in similar positions as dancers&#x27; sometimes confusing people analyzing them . Instruments were also including in depictions of ball games further supporting the connection of dancing, ball games, and warfare are connected in the life style as they all share very similar depictions of what they are. 
In the book of creation, &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, it is recounted that the dances of the Twin Brothers were part of a miracle ceremony. Just as well, the dances of &#x27;The Armadillo&#x27;, &#x27;the Poorwill&#x27;, and &#x27;the Weasel&#x27; pleased the lords of death immensely.
Dance in Maya culture has also acted as a bridge between the ancient and post-Columbian eras. Spanish missionaries and lords as late as the 18th century were trying to eliminate the practice of ancient dance; however, natives maintained roots with their ancestors by practicing in secret. Even after the relatively complete conversion to Catholicism after the Spanish influence arrived, Maya people still respect their ancient deities through ceremonial dance, which has persisted through the generations since the golden age of ancient Maya.

==Research==
In 1966, Michael D. Coe and Elizabeth P. Benson described a dancing scene showing several important lords standing with one heel raised. In 1992, Nikolai Grube deciphered the glyph for &quot;dance&quot; (read as &quot;akʼot&quot;) in Maya script. Some interesting depictions of Maya dance of the Classic era are found on Maya ceramics and in the famous murals of Bonampak.

The word was in a picture that depicts Bird Jaguar IV, a Yaxchilan ruler, in a pose that would be described as dancing holding a writhing snake. The words around the man read chan chan or &quot;celestial snake&quot;. Many of the texts or stelae would be installed on places that the performance the picture had captured would be ideally done at like platforms, plazas or stairways.

Dancing on designs has been hard to find at first. It has been discovered that pictures of people dancing have been found to be standing still in the pictures or with a leg raised and just barely touching the ground. The physical location of where the image is gives hints to its reason. Symbols around and in the image also give helpful hints to the decoding of the image. Some depictions of dances come in a story like format around temples, like the 40 days after Bird Jaguar IV&#x27;s accession which spans many panels and includes a few different temples.

==Technique==
Ancient Maya dance is often characterized by transformations of human beings into supernatural (god like) beings by means of visionary trance. Some think that hallucinogenic drugs or medicines were used to put the performer into an altered state of mind. Once in this state of mind the participants were transformed into their &quot;wayob&quot; or soul companions. These soul companions were depicted through the masks and the costumes people wore in the dance. Some scenes are painted on pottery such as that from the myriad ritual meals of Classic festivals. These vessels depict humans, both kings and nobles, dressed in costumes. Their human faces are shown in cutaway view inside the costumes of the fantastic creatures they have become through the transformation of the dance. Some of these &quot;wayob&quot; are recognizable as animals like jaguars and birds of prey, but others just look like strange monsters.

For the Maya, dance was a very public affair. It induced visionary trances where either individuals or groups went into an altered state of mind that allowed them to communicate with the other world. Those who were strong enough to travel there, told stories about how the land had things like rivers and trees in this world. Some of the great lords depicted themselves dancing out over the abyss that leads into the otherworld.

The distinction between the humans and supernatural beings was never sharply made. Through dance, people became gods and gods became people even if it were only for a moment. These were more than just acts of civic pride or piety. They were considered to be direct connections to the otherworld.

With the written form of dance poses play a big part on how they describe and depict the dance. The gesture of holding the double headed serpent would be described as a gesture of concentration, calm and tranquility. The pose to dancing was discovered to be a lifted heel while still touching the ground. This was discovered in 1911 but was not brought to questions till 1981 by Virginia Miller who defined the pose. This pose was started in the Early Classic period on a small scale while in the eight century started to appear in large scale depiction. This pictures show one heel raised, very rarely is both raised, and the arms in a dynamic pose with the body gazing outwards.

== Writing of dance ==
The &quot;stepping&quot; pose is also closely connected to dance. This pose is a profile of the person with their right foot on the ground while the left is bent with the ball if the foot on the ground. This pose uses much context to discover the meaning. This pose could also be used for walking but the presence of instruments and dance costumes distinguish the two from each other.

The legs are not the only part of the body that mattered when it comes to dance poses. The arm and elbow were used while the hand and fingers are not always shown while almost all people are shown with arms. One dance position of the arms is the arms out towards the way the person is facing or next to the face while another one is a hand by the head with the other on the hip. The arms would be used of the artist did not want to raise the heel of the person while still giving the symbol of dance. The use of just arms as a form of dance is used to show the dancing of someone who is not normally a dancer, like a baby or a god.

With all things there are situations that break the pattern. If the poses for dance are used without certain contexts the meanings of these poses changes. A lifted heel without instruments or dance costumes could be used to describe drunkenness. Warriors and battles also use this pose as a sign to capture enemies as well as to signal a spear being thrown.

==Meanings within dances==
The Snake Dance was also celebrated by the lords of Palenque. This time the dance was done with a male who has an ax in one hand and a serpent in the other, and a woman who is grasping the lower body of the snake. These dancers wore costumes of First father and First Mother, the deities whose actions enabled the final creation and the birth of all the gods. This depiction is thought to point toward the role of dance in the story of Creation.

The most important instrument of Mayan music is the rain stick.

The story of the Popol Vuh exhibits examples of this idea. After the Hero Twins are killed they come back to life as vagabonds and quickly enchant the people of Xibalba with their dancing and magic. The Twins danced such dances as the Dance of the Poorwill, the Weasel and the Armadillo and they are able to bring things back to life. All of this fame caught the attention of the Lords of Death who command the Twins to perform. As the twins perform, the Lords are amazed by their powers and finally ask the Twins to sacrifice them. The Twins do, but this time they do not bring them back to life, limiting the Xibalbans power over humans forever.

Dancers are very specific on where they do their rituals. Certain dances are more private while other are public events that fill stadiums. One Spanish explorer describes a performance he watched as eight hundred heavy warriors danced in a giant stadium. Not one of the warriors were off beat as they danced all day with food and drink brought to them as they danced. Diego Garcia de Palacio compared a courtyard enclosed by stairways in Copan to the Colosseum in Rome. Dances were mostly public rituals showing community by people being different social classes on stage. These stages were normally large centers, public zones or palace compounds which the elites would use more.

Much of Mayan ceremonial architecture contains pieces of art containing figures doing ritual dances. The architect of these building holds figures of what the rooms are normally used for. Some set of staircase contain pictures of captives walking down them giving the idea the rooms here were used to store prisoners. The East Court of the Acropolis in Copan is believed to have been used for dance rituals. The room was used by a dictionary of colonial Yucatec described the acropolis as a community house where they learned to discuss public interest and well as learn to dance.

<doc id="336975" wikidata="Q2113197" url="?curid=336975" title="Candidate key">
<text>A candidate key, or simply a key, of a relational database is any set of columns that have a unique combination of values in each row, with the additional constraint that removing any column could produce duplicate combinations of values.

A candidate key is a minimal superkey, 
i.e., a superkey that does not contain a smaller one. Therefore, a relation can have multiple candidate keys, each with a different number of attributes.

Specific candidate keys are sometimes called &quot;primary keys&quot;, &quot;secondary keys&quot; or &quot;alternate keys&quot;.
The columns in a candidate key are called prime attributes, and a column that does not occur in any candidate key is called a non-prime attribute.

Every relation without NULL values will have at least one candidate key: Since there cannot be duplicate rows, the set of all columns is a superkey, and if that is not minimal, some subset of that will be minimal.

There is a functional dependency from the candidate key to all the attributes in the relation.

The superkeys of a relation are all the possible ways we can identify a row. The candidate keys are the minimal subsets of each superkey and as such, they are an important concept for the design of database schema.

==Example==
The definition of candidate keys can be illustrated with the following (abstract) example. Consider a relation variable (relvar) &quot;R&quot; with attributes (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) that has only the following two legal values &quot;r1&quot; and &quot;r2&quot;:

Here &quot;r2&quot; differs from &quot;r1&quot; only in the A and D values of the last tuple.

For &quot;r1&quot; the following sets have the uniqueness property, i.e., there are no two distinct tuples in the instance with the same attribute values in the set:
: {A,B}, {A,C}, {B,C}, {A,B,C}, {A,B,D}, {A,C,D}, {B,C,D}, {A,B,C,D}
For &quot;r2&quot; the uniqueness property holds for the following sets;
: {B,C}, {B,D}, {C,D}, {A,B,C}, {A,B,D}, {A,C,D}, {B,C,D}, {A,B,C,D}
Since superkeys of a relvar are those sets of attributes that have the uniqueness property for &quot;all&quot; legal values of that relvar and because we assume that &quot;r1&quot; and &quot;r2&quot; are all the legal values that &quot;R&quot; can take, we can determine the set of superkeys of &quot;R&quot; by taking the intersection of the two lists:
: {B,C}, {A,B,C}, {A,B,D}, {A,C,D}, {B,C,D}, {A,B,C,D}
Finally we need to select those sets for which there is no proper subset in the list, which are in this case:
: {B,C}, {A,B,D}, {A,C,D}
These are indeed the candidate keys of relvar &quot;R&quot;.

We have to consider &quot;all&quot; the relations that might be assigned to a relvar to determine whether a certain set of attributes is a candidate key. For example, if we had considered only &quot;r1&quot; then we would have concluded that {A,B} is a candidate key, which is incorrect. However, we &quot;might&quot; be able to conclude from such a relation that a certain set is &quot;not&quot; a candidate key, because that set does not have the uniqueness property (example {A,D} for &quot;r1&quot;). Note that the existence of a proper subset of a set that has the uniqueness property &quot;cannot&quot; in general be used as evidence that the superset is not a candidate key. In particular, note that in the case of an empty relation, every subset of the heading has the uniqueness property, including the empty set.

==Determining candidate keys==
The set of all candidate keys can be computed
e.g. from the set of functional dependencies.
To this end we need to define the attribute closure formula_1 for an attribute set formula_2.
The set formula_1 contains all attributes that are functionally implied by formula_2.

It is quite simple to find a single candidate key.
We start with a set formula_2 of attributes and try to remove successively each attribute.
If after removing an attribute the attribute closure stays the same,
then this attribute is not necessary and we can remove it permanently.
We call the result formula_6.
If formula_2 is the set of all attributes,
then formula_6 is a candidate key.

Actually we can detect every candidate key with this procedure
by simply trying every possible order of removing attributes.
However there are many more permutations of attributes (formula_9)
than subsets (formula_10).
That is, many attribute orders will lead to the same candidate key.

There is a fundamental difficulty for efficient algorithms for candidate key computation:
Certain sets of functional dependencies lead to exponentially many candidate keys.
Consider the formula_11 functional dependencies
formula_12
which yields formula_10 candidate keys:
formula_14.
That is, the best we can expect is an algorithm that is efficient with respect to the number of candidate keys.

The following algorithm actually runs in polynomial time in the number of candidate keys and functional dependencies:

 function find_candidate_keys(A, F)
 /* A is the set of all attributes and F is the set of functional dependencies */
 K[0] := minimize(A);
 n := 1; /* Number of Keys known so far */
 i := 0; /* Currently processed key */
 while i &lt; n do
 for each α → β ∈ F do
 /* Build a new potential key from the previous known key and the current FD */
 S := α ∪ (K[i] − β);
 /* Search whether the new potential key is part of the already known keys */ 
 found := false;
 for j := 0 to n-1 do
 if K[j] ⊆ S then found := true;
 /* If not, add it */
 if not found then
 K[n] := minimize(S);
 n := n + 1;
 i := i + 1
 return K

The idea behind the algorithm is that given a candidate key formula_15
and a functional dependency formula_16,
the reverse application of the functional dependency yields
the set formula_17,
which is a key, too.
It may however be covered by other already known candidate keys.
(The algorithm checks this case using the &#x27;found&#x27; variable.)
If not, then minimizing the new key yields a new candidate key.
The key insight is that all candidate keys can be created this way.

<doc id="336976" wikidata="Q4649590" url="?curid=336976" title="A6 road (England)">
<text>The A6 is one of the main north–south roads in England. It runs from Luton in Bedfordshire to Carlisle in Cumbria, although it formerly started at a junction with the A1 at Barnet in north London, and is described as running from London to Carlisle.

Running north-west from Luton, the road passes through Bedford, bypasses Rushden, Kettering and Market Harborough, continues through Leicester, Loughborough, Derby and Matlock before passing through the Peak District to Bakewell, Buxton, Stockport, Manchester, Salford, Chorley, Preston, Lancaster, Kendal and Penrith before reaching Carlisle.

South of Derby, the road runs approximately parallel to the M1 motorway; between Manchester and Preston, it is close to the M6 and M61 motorways; and from Preston to its northern terminus in Carlisle, it is close to the M6. 

==Route==
The A6, which runs from Luton to Carlisle is known as the London to Carlisle trunk road.
===Luton–Kettering===
The A6 begins as a short stretch of Crawley Green Road at an elongated roundabout with the A505 roadpart of the Luton inner ring road. The A6 follows Crescent Road past Luton railway station into New Bedford Road. It meets the A5228 outer ring road at a roundabout. On the outskirts of Luton, now Barton Road, it meets the Icknield Way Path. Leaving Luton, it enters Central Bedfordshire after a roundabout with Quantock Rise.
A roundabout at Streatley, where the road becomes the dual-carriageway Luton Road, passing through the Bartonhill Cutting, the road becomes single carriageway at the roundabout with the B655 at the other end of the Barton-le-Clay bypass. It meets the A507 at a roundabout at Clophill, crossing the River Flit. It passes by Maulden Wood as the dual-carriage up Deadman&#x27;s Hill then passes Haynes West End. It enters the district of Bedford and bypasses Wilstead. It meets the A421 at the Elstow Interchange grade-separated junction (GSJ). The A6 meets the A5134 at a large signal-controlled junction.

The road crosses the Marston Vale Line and enters Bedford as Ampthill Road. There is a roundabout with the A5141, then it crosses the railway again near Bedford St Johns railway station. It meets the A600 and A5140 at a roundabout, then passes Bedford College and crosses the River Great Ouse as King Street. It takes two one-way routes (Tavistock Street–High Street and Horne Lane–Union Street) through the town centre, which meet at a roundabout, then continues for around 700 yards. It meets the A5141 again at a roundabout near Bedford Modern School and a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket and becomes the dual-carriageway Paula Radcliffe Way; it formerly passed through Clapham itself before the construction of the Paula Radcliffe Way Bypass in 2001.

The A6 crosses the River Great Ouse twice more, and is crossed by the John Bunyan Trail, near a GSJ for Clapham and Oakley. There is another GSJ for Highfield Parc Industrial Estate. At the end of the bypass, the road loses the broad expanse of tarmac and looks like a minor B road and becomes Bedford Road where there are speed cameras. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen&#x27;s Head pub and the exit for Yarl&#x27;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre. It then continues for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near Bletsoe then passes Sharnbrook at a roundabout. Around a mile later it crosses into Northamptonshire and enters the district of North Northamptonshire. It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the Santa Pod Raceway, bypasses the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers, arriving at the Chown&#x27;s Mill roundabout with the A45. From here the road bridges the River Nene and the Nene Way before bypassing Irthlingborough. The A6 then passes through the town of Finedon and intersects the A510 at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road passes the Burton Wold Wind Farm and bypasses Burton Latimer and arrives at junction 10 of the A14 at Barton Seagrave.

===Kettering–Leicester===
Kettering was bypassed when sections of the east–west corridor A14 were built. The A6 reappears at junction 3 of the A14, from there it continues north bypassing Rothwell and Desborough until it meets a roundabout with the B576 (the pre-bypass former A6 route through Desborough and Rothwell). The road enters Leicestershire and the district of Harborough as Harborough Road at the start of the five-mile (8 km) Market Harborough Bypass. It briefly re-enters Northamptonshire where there is a roundabout with the A427 (for Stoke Albany) and A4304 (former A427), and an exit for Great Bowden.
The road is crossed by the Leicestershire Round. There is a turn for Foxton and Foxton Locks. It is crossed by the Midland Main Line. The A6 passes through Kibworth. The road becomes Leicester Road. It crosses the River Sence and there is a roundabout. The bypass ends with a roundabout, just before the road enters the district of Oadby and Wigston.

===Leicester–Peak District===
On the outskirts of Leicester the road becomes London Road. There is a roundabout with Florence Wragg Way, where the road becomes Glen Road. It then becomes Leicester Road before reaching the outer ring-road (A563), next to Leicester Racecourse. It becomes London Road, where the dual-carriageway ends, and it enters the city of Leicester, passing Leicester High School for Girls. There is a crossroads, for Stoughton Road (A6030) at Stoneygate, and a roundabout with the Victoria Park Road (B568). It passes close to Leicester University and many take-away shops. It crosses the Midland Main Line near Leicester railway station. In the centre of Leicester, it is subsumed into Leicester&#x27;s inner ring-road, the A594.
The A6 crosses the Grand Union Canal and the River Soar as St Margarets Way. It becomes dual-carriageway on the northern outskirts of Leicester and passes the National Space Centre in Belgrave as Abbey Lane. Later, it meets a roundabout with the A563 outer ring-road entering the borough of Charnwood. North of Leicester, as Loughborough Road, it meets the A46 Leicester Western Bypass just south of Rothley and the start of the four-mile (6.4 km) dual-carriageway Quorn-Mountsorrel Bypass. The road at this point follows the Soar Valley, and is mostly on embankment or viaduct, crossing the river four times. From here the road passes through Loughborough. North of Hathern is a dual-carriageway section that skirts the Leicestershire–Nottinghamshire border (the River Soar). The road becomes London Road and enters the district of North West Leicestershire. To the south of Kegworth the road heads west along a bypass avoiding the village. It joins the A453 at the East Midlands Gateway industrial park. The A453 then joins the M1 at the roundabout at junction 24, which is where the A50 Derby to Stoke-on-Trent Link begins. The road follows one of the former A6 dual-carriageway sections, passing Lockington, before meeting traffic from the south-bound M1 at junction 24a. The three-laned A6 overlaps the A50 for a couple of miles, and there is a junction with the B6540 (former A453). The road crosses the Trent and Mersey Canal and River Trent, where it enters Derbyshire and the district of South Derbyshire.

Elvaston Castle is to the east. The road enters Derby along London Road and at Alvaston it meets the A5111 Derby Ring Road (Raynesway). It enters Crewton and just after a hump-backed bridge it passes St Osmund&#x27;s Church. There is a roundabout with Ascot Drive near the Derby Conference Centre, and the road exits as Pride Parkway, which is connected to the adjacent Pride Park Business Park and Pride Park Stadium, home of Derby County F.C. It reaches Litchurch near Derby College&#x27;s Roundhouse site; the land on which it was built was a former gas works. This section from the first roundabout to Station Approach (B6000) includes a viaduct with spans over the Midland Main Line. The A6 meets a former route beside the Derbion shopping centre, a former roundabout that was replaced with traffic lights with a multi-storey car park in the centre. The road overlaps the A601, Derby&#x27;s inner ring-road and the A52, crossing the River Derwent, then leaving as King Street at an intersection on St Alkmund&#x27;s Way near the former site of St Alkmund&#x27;s Church. This section to the A38 has a weight limit. As Garden Street, it splits in two at an elongated roundabout surrounding a service station and a pub. At a roundabout known locally as the Five Lamps, it becomes Duffield Road. North of Derby, there is the Palm Court roundabout (named after the former Palm Court café which closed in 2005), a junction with the A38. It follows the Derwent Valley, entering the district of Amber Valley through Duffield and Belper. At Whatstandwell it meets the B5035 (for Crich and Wirksworth), then enters the district of Derbyshire Dales. At Cromford, it meets the A5012 (Via Gellia) before passing Matlock Bath. Entering Matlock, the road passes under the railway and along a new bypass and then over the River Derwent, meeting the A615 at a roundabout. The road then continues on Bakewell Road into Darley Dale, where the road, as Dale Road, passes the hospital, and crossroads with the B5057.

===Peak District–Manchester===
From Matlock the road enters the Peak District National Park. From Rowsley, it follows the River Wye, meeting the B5056 near the endpoint of the River Lathkill. It passes Haddon Hall and enters Bakewell, meeting the B5055 and A619 at a roundabout. At Ashford-in-the-Water, there is a junction with the A6020 (for Baslow). The road passes through Taddington Dale. Taddington has a dual-carriageway bypass. There are junctions with the B6049 (for Blackwell) and A5270, and it enters the district of High Peak and passes under four railway bridges. It enters Buxton as Bakewell Road and meets the B5059 at a roundabout. It leaves Buxton as Fairfield Road, and heads towards Stockport slightly north-east to Dove Holes and to a roundabout with the A623.
The four-mile (6.4 km) part-dual-carriageway Chapel-en-le-Frith and Whaley Bridge bypass passes a roundabout with the A624 to Glossop on the left and ends with a roundabout with the A5004 for Whaley Bridge and Macclesfield (via the B5470). It crosses the Peak Forest Canal and the B6062 leads to Chinley, then goes under the Buxton Line. At Furness Vale it passes the railway station and the primary school. It meets the A6015 at New Mills (Newtown) for the town centre, near the railway station and primary school, where the road enters Cheshire. At Disley on Market Street, the road passes the police station then crosses the Buxton Line near the railway station. At High Lane, the road enters the Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester.
Towards Stockport, the road becomes Buxton Road. In Stepping Hill, it goes near the hospital. At Mersey Square, Stockport just before the road crosses the M60, the road becomes Wellington Road North and crosses the Stockport to Stalybridge Line. At Heaton Chapel, there are crossroads with the B5169 (for Reddish), and the A626 joins to the right. It enters the city of Manchester just before it meets the B6178 and becomes Stockport Road. Near the junction with the B5093 is Levenshulme railway station. It goes under the railway and meets the A5079 (Slade Lane) from the south. There are crossroads with the A6010, and the A5184 leaves. In Longsight, it meets the A665 Manchester inner ring road and the A57 at a roundabout, which it overlaps until it goes under the A57(M)/A635(M), passing the University of Manchester. 

===Manchester city centre–Chorley===
As it passes Manchester Piccadilly station it is called London Road, the previous name of the station, before becoming Piccadilly at Ducie Street. It continues north-west towards Piccadilly Gardens, a major public square and bus station. To the immediate right of this point is the Northern Quarter, an eclectic and bohemian neighbourhood containing cafes, bars and alternative stores. Here, Piccadilly becomes Market Street, a pedestrian commercial avenue, and the A6 designation is discontinued. It then resumes at Chapel Street after crossing the River Irwell. The road crosses the River Irwell at the A56, besides the medieval quarter of Manchester, containing Manchester Cathedral, Chetham&#x27;s Library, the oldest free public library in the world, and Victoria station. Here the road is called Chapel Street as it leaves Manchester City Centre and enters Salford. Where the original Salford Royal Hospital stands (now flats) at its junction with Adelphi Street, its name changes to the Crescent. Along this stretch the road passes the University of Salford, and Salford Museum and Art Gallery, and the Working Class Movement Library, as well as Salford Crescent railway station near the junction with Albion Way. It then continues as the dual carriageway Broad Street through Pendleton and past the junction with Langworthy Road (A5186). At Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height it departs from the dual carriageway, at the terminus of the A580 East Lancashire Road, at the border of Pendlebury. It becomes Manchester Road through Pendlebury for a short distance passing both the site of the former Royal Manchester Children&#x27;s Hospital and Hospital Road. The road enters Swinton and passes Victoria Park opposite the junction with Barton Road. Along Chorley Road the road passes Swinton Post Office and Salford Civic Centre, at the town centre&#x27;s crossroads with the B5231. The road heads north-west towards Linnyshaw and Walkden.

The road passes under the M60 near the junction with the M61, near the Worsley Braided Interchange and Wardley Hall (home of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford) and enters Whittle Brook and Walkden as Manchester Road, passing the Linnyshaw Industrial Estate on the right. The A6 meets the A575 (for Worsley and Farnworth) and B5232 (for Boothstown) at crossroads where the road is dual-carriageway as High Street. It becomes Manchester Road East and continues towards Little Hulton. It meets the A5082 (for Tyldesley and Farnworth) at crossroads near St Paul&#x27;s Church, Peel, becoming Manchester Road West.

On leaving Little Hulton, the road enters the Borough of Bolton near the Chloride Battery Works. Near Farnworth, the road meets the M61, at junction 4, which closely follows parallel with the A6 up to Preston. The road is now the primary route Salford Road and meets the A579 at crossroads at Hulton Lane Ends becoming Manchester Road. It meets the A58 at a roundabout at Chequerbent and is no longer a trunk road. Close to M61 junction 5, the A6 enters Westhoughton. Then it crosses the Manchester to Southport railway line and meets the B5236 at Wingates near St John&#x27;s Primary School and the St. John the Evangelist Church. On leaving Westhoughton, the road becomes Chorley Road. At Four Gates, there is the B5239 for Aspull. It meets the A6027 roundabout close to the M61 junction 6 for Horwich. It passes through Hilton House, at Scot Lane End, it meets the B5408 for Blackrod, becoming the Blackrod By-Pass Road. It meets the B5238, for Horwich, at crossroads near Blackrod railway station. Close by on the M61 is the Rivington services (formerly Bolton West services). It rejoins the old route where it meets the B5408.

Leaving Greater Manchester, it enters Adlington, Lancashire, and the district of Chorley where it crosses the River Douglas as Chorley Road, becoming Market Street. In the centre of Adlington it meets the B6227 near Adlington railway station, and the police station, becoming Church Street then Westhoughton Road. It crosses the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and meets the A673 from Bolton and A5106 from Standish.

It crosses the River Yarrow and passes the Albany Science College as Bolton Road. In Chorley, the central section is dual-carriageway with many roundabouts. It meets the B6228 at a roundabout, passes the railway station, then meets the A581 and B6229. It passes a hospital and meets the B5252 at a roundabout where it crosses the railway. The dual-carriageway A674 goes to Blackburn via the nearby junction 8 of the M61 and the Preston England Temple, a Mormon temple.

===Chorley–Carnforth===
From Chorley, it meets the B6229 and B5248 at Whittle-le-Woods, passing the St John the Evangelist Church and crossing the River Lostock. It enters Clayton-le-Woods and meets the B5256 (for Leyland) at a roundabout near Cuerden Hall. It passes through Clayton Brook and crosses the M65, entering the South Ribble district, near its western terminus. There are two roundabouts for the Walton Summit Industrial Estate, either of which lead to the Walton Summit Motorway. Next is a roundabout with the M6 at junction 29, which is now shared with the M65 where it becomes a trunk road. The roundabout was formerly the southern end of the Preston Bypass, Britain&#x27;s first motorway. The road becomes dual-carriageway as it passes Bamber Bridge. There are crossroads with the northern terminus of the A49 then a roundabout with the A582 – where the road heads north as London Way, built in the 1980s to bypass Bamber Bridge and later widened. The start of the M65 is accessible only from this roundabout at junction 1a. It crosses the East Lancashire Line and meets the B5257 at a roundabout. It meets the B6230 at a roundabout at Dog Kennel Wood, crosses the River Darwen and meets the A675 at Walton-le-Dale, where the bypass ends.
The A6 crosses the River Ribble and the Ribble Way, entering Preston district. It enters Preston as a single carriageway, meeting the A59 (for Blackburn), B6243 (for Ribbleton), and A6063. It passes through the centre of Preston, becoming North Road, meeting the A5071 (Moor Lane), then becoming Garstang Road. The A6 passes Moor Park and crosses the A5085 Blackpool Road. At Fulwood, it meets the B6242 at crossroads, then passes Sharoe Green. North of junctions with the B6241 Preston ring road, junction 1 of the M55 is a roundabout on the A6 connected by slip roads with the motorway above. This was formerly the northern end of the Preston bypass.

After the motorway, a bypass opened in 2017 takes the A6 east of Broughton, where it formerly met the B5269 at crossroads; the bypass, James Towers Way, is dual carriageway as far as the roundabout where the roads now cross and meets the former A6 at another roundabout. Through Barton, still as Garstang Road, it runs along the Preston and Wyre district boundary, converging with the West Coast Main Line and crossing the railway on a bridge. The district boundary crosses to the other side of the road and it enters the Borough of Wyre. It passes through Bilsborrow before leaving the district boundary, crosses the River Brock at Brock, and passes the site of a former railway station; a bridge carries the road over the Lancaster Canal. At Catterall, it meets the B6430 – the original A6 route – and crosses the River Wyre, and as Preston Lancaster New Road meets the A586 (for Churchtown). It enters Garstang and crosses the Lancaster Canal again. It meets the B5272 and B6430 – the original A6 coming back to meet us – and enters Cabus. At Forton, it passes close to the Forton service station on the M6. At Potters Brook, it meets a crossroads and enters the City of Lancaster. It meets the M6 at junction 33 and goes through Galgate as Main Road, passing under the West Coast Main Line, which it then runs adjacent to. The University of Lancaster lies in the separation between the A6 and the M6, where there is a short section of dual-carriageway on the A6 alongside the West Coast Main Line. The road enters Lancaster as Scotforth Road then Greaves Road.

It meets the A588 Ashton Road for Preesall at a roundabout, continues past the Royal Lancaster Infirmary on the left, then crosses the Lancaster Canal. It splits in two as it passes through the centre of Lancaster. It rejoins and splits again to cross the River Lune on the Greyhound Bridge and older Skerton Bridge. The A589 crosses for Morecambe and Caton and M6 junction 34. The road rejoins as Owen Road near Skerton Community High School and there is the B5231 for Morecambe, and a road for Halton. It crosses the Lancaster Canal and meets the A683 Heysham to M6 Link Road, and then heads through Hest Bank as Lancaster Road passing Bolton-le-Sands. It crosses the Lancaster Canal and meets the A5105 Coastal Road (from Morecambe) to the left at Bolton-le-Sands. Here the road is at its closest point to Morecambe Bay. It follows the Lancaster Canal and enters Carnforth as Lancaster Road and meets the B6254 which leads to M6 junction 35.

===Carnforth–Carlisle===

Leaving Carnforth, the A6 follows Scotland Road across the River Keer. It meets the former A601(M) at junction 35a of the M6 near Warton. There is a roundabout with the A6070, and the road, which has a short section of dual-carriageway, crosses the West Coast Main Line near Yealand Conyers. It enters Cumbria and the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority area near the Lakeland Wildlife Oasis Centre and Hale Moss. Nearby on the M6 is the Burton-in-Kendal services. It passes through Hale. At Beetham, it crosses the River Bela then passes through Milnthorpe as Beetham Road and Church Street, meeting the B5282 and B6385. It by-passes Heversham as Princes Way (built in 1927), passing by Levens Hall, crosses the River Kent at the old Levens Bridge. The A6 then meets the A590 and overlaps the A591 becoming a trunk road, the dual-carriageway Kendal bypass. It passes Sizergh Castle before leaving at a GSJ becoming the single carriageway Milnthorpe Road. It passes through Kendal, splitting in two, where it meets the northern end of the A65.

In Kendal, it passes Kendal College and the Queen Katherine School. It crosses the River Kent on the Nether Bridge and Miller Bridge. It passes under the Windermere Branch Line near Kendal railway station then meets the A685 (to Kirkby Stephen), passes over the River Mint as Shap Road and is crossed by the Dales Way. It briefly passes through the Lake District National Park. It crosses Borrowdale Beck (a tributary of the River Lune) and Huck&#x27;s Bridge at Borrowdale, Westmorland, it enters the Eden district.
The road climbs to over at Shap Summit, and heads over the Shap Fells into Wasdale where it leaves the National Park and passes the RMC granite works. A spur of the A6 meets the B6261 and joins the M6 at junction 39. The road is no longer a trunk road and passes the Corus lime kilns on Hardendale Fell and enters Shap where it is crossed by the Coast to Coast Walk, and over the West Coast Line. It passes under then over the M6, then passes close to Hackthorpe Hall and the Lowther Castle Inn. It passes over the M6 near Lowther, which is near the Lakeland Bird of Prey Centre. It passes over the railway at Clifton near Penrith. There is a turn for Brougham and it crosses the River Lowther at Eamont Bridge where it meets the B6262 and crosses the River Eamont over a narrow bridge. It meets the A66 at Kemplay roundabout next to Penrith Hospital.
The A6 takes a central route through Penrith, entering the town as Bridge Lane then Victoria Road and leaving as &#x27;Stricklandgate then Scotland Road. North of Penrith, it meets the B5305 (which heads to Wigton) at the Stoneybeck roundabout situated on a new section of the A6 built for junction 41 of the M6. The next section of the A6 is one of the most dangerous roads in the county and follows a former Roman road, having seen several deaths in the past few years.

This section through Inglewood Forest in Hesket civil parish follows a parallel path to the M6, and passes through Plumpton where it meets the B6413; an old Roman fort, Voreda, at Castlesteads Farm; High Hesket which it bypasses; Low Hesket; enters the City of Carlisle near Cotehill; and meets the M6 (and the B6263) at junction 42: the start of the Carlisle bypass. Entering Carlisle, it crosses the River Petteril (near a large radio mast) then the Tyne Valley railway line. The A6 travels through south-eastern Carlisle as London Road, before finishing at Botchergate in the centre of Carlisle where it transforms into the A7 which runs out of Carlisle and across the Anglo-Scottish border terminating at Scotland&#x27;s capital city of Edinburgh.

==History==
===Former route south of Luton===
The route of the old A6 south of Luton is now the A1081 for most of its length. In the initial road numbering scheme, the A6 started in Barnet where it joined what was then the A1 Great North Road. From Barnet the road went to London Colney, St Albans, Harpenden to join the current start of the road at Luton. At St Albans, the road met the then A5 at a crossroads: going north on both roads, the A5 arriving from the south-west, and leaving the crossroads north-west, and the A6 arriving from the south-east and leaving to the north-east.

==Incidents==
* A6 murder – the August 1961 murder of Michael Gregsten at a lay-by on the A6 in Bedfordshire, and the controversial trial and execution of James Hanratty for the crime.

<text>The representation of jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures has a long history, with iconographic examples dating back to at least the mid-Formative period of Mesoamerican chronology.

The jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;) is an animal with a prominent association and appearance in the cultures and belief systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies in the New World, similar to the lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) and tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;) in the Old World. Quick, agile, and powerful enough to take down the largest prey in the jungle, the jaguar is the biggest felid in Central or South America, and one of the most efficient and aggressive predators. Endowed with a spotted coat and well-adapted for the jungle, hunting either in the trees or water, making it one of the few felines tolerant of water, the jaguar was, and remains, revered among the Indigenous Americans who live in its range.

All major Mesoamerican civilizations prominently featured a jaguar god, and for many, such as the Olmec, the jaguar was an important part of religious practice. For those who resided in or near the tropical jungle, the jaguar was well known and became incorporated into the lives of the inhabitants. The jaguar&#x27;s formidable size, reputation as a predator, and its evolved capacities to survive in the jungle made it an animal to be revered. The Olmec and the Maya witnessed this animal&#x27;s habits, adopting the jaguar as an authoritative and martial symbol, and incorporated the animal into their mythology. The jaguar stands today, as it did in the past, as an important symbol in the lives of those who coexist with this felid.

==Jaguars and the Maya==

Integration of the jaguar into the sacred and secular realms of the Maya peoples is proven in the archaeological record. The Maya, whose territory spanned the Yucatán Peninsula all the way to the Pacific coast of Guatemala, was a literate society who left documentation of their lives (mostly the lives of the aristocracy) and belief system in the form of books and bas-relief sculpture on temples, stelae, and pottery. Often depicted on these artifacts are the gods the Maya revered and it is no coincidence that these gods often have jaguar attributes. As stated earlier, the jaguar is said to have the ability to cross between worlds, and for the Maya daytime and nighttime represented two different worlds. The living and the earth are associated with the day, and the spirit world and the ancestors are associated with the night. As the jaguar is quite at home in the nighttime, the jaguar is believed to be part of the underworld; thus, &quot;Maya gods with jaguar attributes or garments are underworld gods&quot; (Benson 1998:64). One such god is Xbalanque, one of the Maya Hero Twins who descended to the underworld, and whose entire body is covered with patches of jaguar skin. Another is God L, who is &quot;the primary lord of the underworld&quot; and often is shown with a jaguar ear or jaguar attire, and atop a jaguar throne (Benson 1998: 64-65). Not only is the underworld associated with the ancestors, but it also is understood as, where plants originate. In addition, the Maya&#x27;s source of fresh water comes from underground pools in the porous limestone that makes up the Yucatán, called &quot;cenotes&quot;. These associations with water and plants further reinforce the notion of the jaguar as a god of fertility.

The jaguar is further associated with vegetation and fertility by the Maya with what is known as the Waterlily jaguar, which is depicted as having water lilies sprouting from its head (Benson 1998:64-67).

No doubt, the jaguar&#x27;s brilliant coat made it quite desirable, however, not all were allowed to don the jaguar pelt as it became the identification of the ruling class for the Maya. Not only did Maya kings wear jaguar pelts, but they also adopted the jaguar as part of their ruling name, as a symbol of their might and authority. One such ruling family to incorporate the jaguar into their name is known as, Jaguar Paw, who ruled the Maya city of Tikal in the fourth century. Jaguar Paw I was ousted by central Mexicans from Teotihuacán, and it was not until late in the fifth century that the Jaguar Paw family returned to power (Coe 1999: 90). Other Maya rulers to incorporate the jaguar name include, Scroll Jaguar, Bird Jaguar, and Moon Jaguar, just to name a few (Coe 1999: 247-48). In addition to the ruling class, the jaguar also was associated with warriors and hunters. Those who excelled in hunting and warfare often adorned themselves with jaguar pelts, teeth, or claws and were &quot;regarded as possessing feline souls&quot; (Saunders 1998: 26).

Archeologists have found a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600-900 AD), which depicts a musical instrument that has been reproduced and played. This instrument is astonishing in at least two respects. First, it is the only stringed instrument known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments. Second, when played, it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar&#x27;s growl. A sample of this sound is available at the Princeton Art Museum website.

== Jaguars and Teotihuacan ==
In the city-state of Teotihuacan jaguar bones have been found in caches of precious or significant objects, including obsidian and greenstone, in both the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. These caches were placed in the pyramids as they were being built, likely as part of a ceremony to dedicate the pyramids. Analysis of the animal bones has shown that while some of the jaguars had been wild shortly before burial, many had lived in captivity for a long time prior to being placed in the dedicatory cache.
==Jaguars and the Olmecs==

The Olmec civilization was first defined as a distinctive art style at the turn of the nineteenth century. The various sculpture, figurines, and celts from what now is recognized as the Olmec heartland on the southern Gulf Coast, reveal that these people knew their jungle companions well and incorporated them into their mythology.

In the surviving Olmec archaeological record, jaguars are rarely portrayed naturalistically, but rather with a combination of feline and human characteristics. These feline anthropomorphic figures may range from a human figure with slight jaguar characteristics to depictions of figures in the so-called transformative pose, kneeling with hands on knees, to figures that are nearly completely feline.

One of the most prominent, distinctive, and enigmatic Olmec designs to appear in the archaeological record has been the &quot;were-jaguar&quot;. Seen not only in figurines, the motif also may be found carved into jade &quot;votive axes&quot; and celts, engraved onto various portable figurines of jade, and depicted on several &quot;altars&quot;, such as those at La Venta. Were-jaguar babies are often held by a stoic, seated adult male.

The were-jaguar figure is characterized by a distinctive down-turned mouth with fleshy lips, almond-shaped eyes, and a cleft head similar – it is said – to that of the male jaguar which has a cleft running vertically the length of its head.

It is not known what the were-jaguar represented to the Olmec, and it may well have represented different things at different times.

== Other instances of the jaguar in Mesoamerican cultures ==

=== Tecuanes dances in present-day Mexico ===
&quot;Tēcuani&quot; (and its variants tekuani, tekuane, tecuane) means &quot;jaguar&quot; in Nahuatl. In the south-center of Mexico the &quot;danza de los tecuanes&quot; is performed in at least 96 communities. In this region jaguar dances are very popular. There are many variants of jaguar dances. Some of the most popular are the &quot;tecuanes dances&quot;, &quot;tlacololeros dances&quot; and &quot;tlaminques dances&quot; 

=== Jaguars and naguals ===
The jaguar is important for certain religious authorities in many Mesoamerican cultures, who often associate the jaguar as a spirit companion or &quot;nagual&quot;, which will protect the religious figures from evil spirits and while they move between the earth and the spirit realm. In order for the religious authorities to combat whatever evil forces may be threatening, or for those who rely on the religious authorities for protection, it is necessary for some religious authorities to transform and cross over to the spirit realm. The jaguar is often a &quot;nagual&quot; because of its strength, for it is necessary that the religious authorities &quot;dominate the spirits, in the same way as a predator dominates its prey&quot; (Saunders 1998:30). The jaguar is said to possess the transient ability of moving between worlds because of its comfort both in the trees and the water, the ability to hunt as well in the nighttime as in the daytime, and the habit of sleeping in caves, places often associated with the deceased ancestors. The concept of the transformation of a religious authority is well-documented in Mesoamerica and South America and is in particular demonstrated in the various Olmec jaguar transformation figures (Diehl, p. 106).

<text>Lake Nasser ( &quot;&quot;, ) is a large reservoir in southern Egypt and northern Sudan. It was created by the construction of the Aswan High Dam and is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Before its creation, the project faced opposition from Sudan as it would encroach on land in the northern part of the country, where many Nubian people lived who would have to be resettled. In the end Sudan&#x27;s land near the area of Lake Nasser was mostly flooded by the lake. The lake has become an important economic resource in Egypt, improving agriculture and touting robust fishing and tourism industries.

Strictly speaking, &quot;Lake Nasser&quot; refers only to the much larger portion of the lake that is in Egyptian territory (83% of the total), with the Sudanese preferring to call their smaller body of water Lake Nubia ( &quot;&quot;, ). 
==Physical characteristics==

The lake is some long and across at its widest point, which is near the Tropic of Cancer. It covers a total surface area of and has a storage capacity of some of water.

== History ==

=== Before the Aswan High Dam and Lake Nasser ===
Before the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the consequent creation of the Lake Nasser, the area that the lake now occupies was a significant part of the region of Nubia, home to several pharaohs of Egypt and empires such as that of the Kush.

=== Construction of the Aswan High Dam 1960–1970 ===

The construction of the Aswan High Dam began in 1960 at the behest of Lake Nasser&#x27;s namesake and the second president of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser. It was President Anwar Sadat who inaugurated the lake and dam in 1971. Finished in 1970, the Aswan High Dam across the Nile was built to replace the insufficient Aswan Low Dam built in 1902. The goals of the High Dam and the reservoir it created, Lake Nasser, were to create a more stable source of water, to increase agricultural production, and to produce electricity for Egypt.

=== Controversies ===
The construction of the Aswan High Dam and Nasser Lake was host to several controversies related to its effects on the environment and those living in the effected area.

==== Displacement of Nubians ====
As a result of the construction and Aswan High Dam and the subsequent filling of Nasser Lake, tens of thousands of native Nubians were forced to relocate from their homes and migrate elsewhere. Though some have been able to resettle on the shores of the new lake, their original homes have been flooded and lost to the lake.

==== Flooding of ancient ruins and monuments ====
The construction of the Aswan High Dam and Nasser Lake sparked an international movement to preserve the history of the region. Due to the filling of the new Lake Nasser, much of the region would be flooded and as such, the ancient monuments and artifacts that lay there would have been lost. Due to this, an international effort was made to rescue and relocate many of the ancient sites and artifacts that were threatened which culminated in the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia led by UNESCO. Though a great many sites were saved and relocated such as the temples of Kalabsha, Wadi es-Sebua, and Amada, some sites such as the fortress of Buhen were unable to be rescued and now rest underwater in the lake. The most famous of those that were rescued were temples at Abu Simbel which were broken down and relocated safely off the coast of Lake Nasser.

==== Ecological ramifications ====
The damming of the Nile has come with several ecological consequences as the natural flow and processes of the river have been interrupted. One effect has been the interruption of the flow of sediments downstream of the dam, which since ancient times had provided many of the needed nutrients for agriculture downstream. Consequently, Egyptian farmers have been forced to resort to mineral fertilizers to maintain arable land for growing crops. The habitat of several native animal species past Lake Nasser and the Aswan High Dam, such as that of the Nile crocodile, have also been greatly affected as the reduction of water levels that came with the construction of the dam rendered these habitats uninhabitable.

==Economic impacts==
By providing a reliable source of water for irrigation and agriculture year-round instead of the seasonal and unpredictable floods of the Nile River, Lake Nasser has provided a large boon to the agricultural industry of the Egyptian economy. The agricultural industry employs about 25% of Egypt&#x27;s population and is a vital sector of the Egyptian economy. With the creation of a more stable water supply in Lake Nasser, the agricultural productivity of farmers in Egypt has increased in existing arable land. In the years immediately following the filling of the lake, Egypt&#x27;s arable land increased by about 30%.

Being home to 52 different species of fish which are dominated by several different species of tilapia which make up the vast majority of catches, as well as the popular Nile perch, Lake Nasser has developed a robust fishing industry with thousands of fishing boats sailing the lake and fish processing facilities dotting its shores. In addition to commercial fishing, the rich aquatic life of the lake has attracted many recreational fishers to the lake as well.

Lake Nasser has become a popular tourist destination for recreational fishing as well sightseeing cruises on the lake itself. The many relocated monuments saved from the initial filling of Lake Nasser have become a major tourist attraction for the region, especially examples such as the Abu Simbel temples.

The Aswan High Dam which holds Lake Nasser produces about 2.1 gigawatts of hydroelectricity, providing a significant percentage of Egypt&#x27;s electricity needs (up to half when it was completed in 1970).

== Current and future issues ==

=== Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam ===
With the beginning of construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in 2011, Egypt faces the threat of water shortage as the new upstream dam would reduce the amount of water flowing downstream to Lake Nasser. As this flow of water from the Nile into Egypt and Sudan constitutes a major part in their economy, its reduction due to the construction of the GERD could potentially be devastating for the nations. The project was about 90% completed by 2023; staged filling of the reservoir began in 2020. The GERD has already begun affecting Egypt as it has reduced the flow of water down the Nile River and decreased available agricultural land for the country. If Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia are unable to come together to work out possible solutions or compromises for this water problem, The GERD could possibly pose an existential threat to Lake Nasser and could have a great destabilizing effect on Egypt and Sudan who rely on it so greatly in many sectors of the economy.

<doc id="336986" wikidata="Q49754" url="?curid=336986" title="Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)">
<text>The Christian Democratic Union of Germany (, CDU) was an East German political party founded in 1945. It was part of the National Front with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and a bloc party until 1989.

It contested the free elections in 1990 as an arm of the West German Christian Democratic Union, into which it merged after German reunification later that same year.

==Party politics==

The CDU was originally very similar to its West German counterpart. Like the West German CDU, its support came mostly from devout middle class Christians. However, it was a little more left-leaning than the West German CDU.

Its first chairman was Andreas Hermes, who had been a prominent member of the Centre Party during the Weimar Republic and a three-time minister. He fled to the West in 1946 and was replaced by Jakob Kaiser, another former Centre Party member and a leading member of the resistance movement during World War II. Kaiser had been a prominent member of the Centre&#x27;s left wing, and favoured nationalisation of heavy industries and a land distribution programme suggested by the Communists. However, his criticism of the Communists resulted in him being pushed out in 1947 in favour of the more pliant Otto Nuschke, a former member of the German Democratic Party (DDP). 

Nuschke and his supporters gradually pushed out those CDU members who were not willing to do the Communists&#x27; bidding. This culminated at the Sixth Party Congress in 1952, at which it formally transformed itself into a loyal partner of the Communists. At this gathering, it declared itself &quot;a Socialist party without any limitations&quot; in accordance with the new line of &quot;Christian realism&quot;.

In the 22 &quot;Theses on Christian Realism&quot;, the CDU committed itself to the &quot;Socialist reorganisation of Society&quot; (1st edition, 1951). Emphasising the &quot;exemplary realisation&quot; of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;teaching on building a new, better social order&quot; in the USSR, it was declared that Socialism offered at the time &quot;the best opportunity for the realisation of Christ&#x27;s demands and for exercising the practical Christianity&quot;. The programme also asserted the CDU&#x27;s support for the working class&#x27; leading role in establishing socialism, a development which the party regarded from its 6th Congress onward as &quot;historically necessary and consistent&quot;.

Its deputies, like all other East German parties, consistently voted for the government&#x27;s proposals in the Volkskammer. The only exception was the vote on 9 March 1972 on the abortion law, when there were 14 &#x27;nays&#x27; and 8 absentees among the CDU deputies.

After Nuschke&#x27;s death, August Bach, another former DDP member, led the party for the remainder of the 1950s. In 1966 long-time general secretary Gerald Götting was elected chairman. Götting, who was chairman of the Volkskammer (and &quot;de facto&quot; vice president of the GDR) from 1969 to 1976, carried on and elaborated the pro-government line.

Götting remained chairman and an SED ally until Erich Honecker was deposed in favour of Egon Krenz in October 1989. On 2 November 1989, Götting was deposed by inner party reformers. In December 1989 Lothar de Maizière, a lawyer and deputy chairman of the Evangelical Church Synod of East Germany, was elected chairman. From that point on the party deposed (and later expelled) its former top figures, and became the strongest proponent of speedy reunification with West Germany.

In March 1990, the CDU became the main element of the Alliance for Germany, a centre-right coalition. It won the first (and as it turned out, only) free general election and became the biggest party in the People&#x27;s Chamber. In April de Maizière became Prime Minister of the GDR, heading a grand coalition that immediately set about reuniting the country with the West.

In August 1990, the Democratic Awakening, a minor member of the governing coalition, merged into the East German CDU. The merger brought Democratic Awakening spokeswoman and future Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel into the party.

In October 1990, the East German CDU merged into the West German CDU.

==Newspaper==
The official newspaper of the party was &quot;Neue Zeit&quot;, published by Union: Verlag.

== International relations ==
The CDU maintained close relations with other Christian democratic parties in the Soviet bloc. Relations with the state-sponsored and -controlled Catholic PAX Association in Poland and the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party (CSL) were especially close. There were some contacts with individual members of the Italian Christian Democracy party (DC), the Belgian Christian People&#x27;s Party (CVP) and Christian Social Party (PSC) and the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

Although the East German CDU and its West German counterpart were often at odds with each other, they maintained official relations.

The East German Christian Democrats also had close relations with the Russian Orthodox Church.

<doc id="336988" wikidata="Q2261810" url="?curid=336988" title="Peter Gzowski">
<text>Peter John Gzowski (July 13, 1934 – January 24, 2002), known colloquially as &quot;Mr. Canada&quot;, or &quot;Captain Canada&quot;, was a Canadian broadcaster, writer and reporter, most famous for his work on the CBC radio shows &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Morningside&quot;. His first biographer argued that Gzowski&#x27;s contribution to Canadian media must be considered in the context of efforts by a generation of Canadian nationalists to understand and express Canada&#x27;s cultural identity. Gzowski wrote books, hosted television shows, and worked at a number of newspapers and at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. Gzowski was known for a friendly, warm, interviewing style.

==Life and career==
Gzowski was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Margaret McGregor (née Young) and Harold Edward Gzowski. His paternal great-great-grandfather was Sir Casimir Gzowski, of Polish nobility, who became a prominent engineer in Canada, noted in particular for his work on the Grand Trunk Railway and the Welland Canal. Sir Casimir Gzowski was an aide de camp of Queen Victoria - who knighted him - and briefly acted as the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, when his predecessor died in office.

The marriage of Gzowski&#x27;s parents ended shortly after Gzowski was born, with Harold Gzowski leaving the marriage for a Depression-era vagabond life. Gzowski and his mother were supported by Harold Gzowski&#x27;s family, following Harold Gzowski&#x27;s departure. Gzowski&#x27;s mother then married Reg Brown, a sales manager of a local textile mill, and the family relocated to Galt, Ontario, in 1939, when Gzowski was five.

Gzowski encountered difficulties succeeding in high school in Galt. During the Christmas break in his Grade 11 year, Gzowski reconnected with his father in Toronto, living with him for a short period, before his father encouraged him to attend Ridley College boarding school, in St. Catharines, Ontario, which Gzowski&#x27;s father had also attended. Gzowski&#x27;s mother died the summer following the commencement of Gzowski&#x27;s studies at Ridley College. Gzowski&#x27;s mother was 40; Gzowski was 16.

Gzowski attended the University of Toronto but never graduated; he was later awarded 11 honorary degrees. Midway through university, he took time off to work for the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot;. During his last year, 1956–57, at the U of T, he edited the student newspaper &quot;The Varsity&quot;. In the spring of 1957, he became city editor of the &quot;Moose Jaw Times-Herald&quot;. After a few months in Moose Jaw, he was hired by the Chatham Daily News. In September 1958, he joined the staff of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. When he was 28 he became the youngest-ever managing editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. In the 1960s he moved to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and became the last editor of &quot;The Star Weekly&quot; magazine until it was sold in 1968.

His first regular radio show was Radio Free Friday, 1969–1970. In 1971 he became the radio host of CBC&#x27;s &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot;. From 1976 to 1978 he hosted the television show &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot; on CBC Television. In 1982 he returned to his former morning radio program, which had by now been renamed &quot;Morningside&quot;, where he remained until 1997. He also narrated a few Heritage Minutes. He returned to Moose Jaw, to host his last episode of Morningside from the Temple Gardens Mineral Spa Resort.
In 1986, Gzowski held the first fundraising golf tournament for literacy, a cause that was very important to him. That tournament has evolved and is now held in every province and territory of Canada and has raised more than $13-million for volunteer-based literacy programs.
As part of its activities, it honours a Canadian each year with the Peter Gzowski Award for contributions to adult literacy in Canada. Gzowski indirectly contributed through his journalism to matters of national importance, such as in his 1995 CBC Radio coverage of the 30th anniversary of the Canadian Maple Leaf flag, a contrubution that was re-aired in part on 15 February 2025.

Throughout most of his life, Gzowski had been a heavy smoker of cigarettes, consuming up to 75 cigarettes per day. In 2000, Gzowski stopped smoking through attending a treatment centre for persons with addictions. A few months following the completion of treatment, Gzowski developed emphysema, following a chest infection. By the fall of 2001, he was largely confined to his home, breathing with the assistance of an oxygen tank. In 2001, he contributed the essay &quot;How to Quit Smoking in Fifty Years or Less&quot; to &quot;Addicted: Notes from the Belly of the Beast&quot;, edited by Lorna Crozier and Patrick Lane, and published by Greystone Books. The essay was reprinted in September 2001 by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as &quot;Out of breath&quot;. He also wrote the essay &quot;Life after smoking&quot;, which was published in &quot;50+ Magazine&quot; in June 2001 and included in &quot;A Peter Gzowski Reader&quot;, published by McClelland and Stewart in October, 2001. The book is a collection of Gzowski&#x27;s written works, commencing from his time as a writer for &quot;The Varsity&quot; at the University of Toronto, collected and with commentary by Gzowski. Gzowski died of emphysema in Toronto on January 24, 2002.

Gzowski was divorced from his first wife, Jennie Lissaman, from Brandon, Manitoba, whom he met while residing in Moose Jaw and with whom he had five children (Alison, Maria, Peter, John and Mick). He was survived also by two common-law partners, Jan Walter and Gillian Howard, whom he called his &quot;Partner for Life&quot;. Gzowski was the father of a son (Robert Lawrence Perkins), born in 1961, from an extra-marital relationship.

Following his death, his remains were placed in the family tomb at St. James Cemetery in Toronto.

<doc id="336991" wikidata="Q6122857" url="?curid=336991" title="Jaguar (Insurgent Comix)">
<text>The Jaguar is a fictional character, a comic book superheroine created by artist Laura Molina and published under her privately owned Insurgent Comix imprint. The character, created in response to California&#x27;s 1994 passage of proposition 187, made her first appearance in &quot;Cihualyaomiquiz, The Jaguar&quot; #1 (1996).

The Jaguar&#x27;s secret identity is that of Linda Rivera, an East Los Angeles law student. Linda lives in an alternate timeline in which proposition 187 has transformed California in to a police state ruled by right-wing fundamentalist groups, which enact the removal of equal employment and affirmative action policies. People of color are consistently denied civil rights while racist hate groups are allowed to proliferate throughout the state. Tired of seeing her people persecuted, Rivera dons the mantle of Cihualyaomiquiz, a term from the Aztec language translated as &quot;Woman ready to die in battle&quot; and becomes a vigilante known as the Jaguar. She is assisted by local activists groups and makes use of her fighting ability, detective skills and knowledge of the law in her pursuit of social justice.

==Publication history==
Molina first conceived the Jaguar as a response to California&#x27;s proposition 187 which was designed to deny illegal immigrants social services, health care, and public education. The proposition would later pass with 58.8% of the vote before being overturned by the United States federal court. Molina viewed the proposition as a license to discriminate and a direct attack on human rights, as explained in her 1996 introduction to the character:

The Jaguar made her first published appearance in &quot;Cihualyaomiquiz, The Jaguar #1&quot;, written and illustrated in 1996 by Laura Molina, with Tomás Benitez assisting with additional story editing and dialogue. The series is on hiatus, but Molina promised further installments.

==Fictional character history==
Shortly after the passing of proposition 187, the rightwing backlash brings a new attack on civil rights, equal employment and affirmative action. Soon politicians are pushing for a national proposition 187. The right wing becomes corrupted by corporate media conglomerates and super rich while racist hate groups begin to grow more vocal and violent. The dignity of minority groups is assaulted on a daily basis with increasing violence against Chicano activist groups.

After witnessing the racist authority of California firsthand, Linda Rivera reclaims her heritage by reuniting with her native history. Adopting the mantle of Cihualyaomiquiz, dedicates her vigilante activities to Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of war. Every night she performs an ancient ritual in which copal is lit and calls upon her nahual (spirit guide) to transform into her alter ego as The Jaguar. During one of her first adventures, she is shown to have received important information from an unnamed activist group in order to steal some important legal documents. Along the way she encountered two neo-nazis in a back alley doing drugs. They attempted to overpower her, but she easily dispatches of the two of them. Before leaving she concludes the altercation by congratulating them for being so lucky, because &quot;after all, my ancestors used to eat their enemies.&quot;

==Literary analysis==
Since the character&#x27;s debut, the Jaguar has been interpreted and discussed in other forms. One notable example appears in Laura E. Pérez&#x27; &quot;Chicana Art: The Politics of Spiritual and Aesthetic Altarities&quot;, in which the comic book was compared to Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;:

<doc id="336994" wikidata="Q17074524" url="?curid=336994" title="Engines of Creation">
<text>Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology is a 1986 molecular nanotechnology book written by K. Eric Drexler with a foreword by Marvin Minsky. An updated version was released in 2007. The book has been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Chinese.

==Synopsis==
The book features nanotechnology, which Richard Feynman had discussed in his 1959 speech &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.&quot; Drexler imagines a world where the entire Library of Congress can fit on a chip the size of a sugar cube and where universal assemblers, tiny machines that can build objects atom by atom, will be used for everything from medicinal robots that help clear capillaries to environmental scrubbers that clear pollutants from the air. In the book, Drexler proposes the gray goo scenario—one prediction of what might happen if molecular nanotechnology were used to build uncontrollable self-replicating machines.

Topics also include hypertext as developed by Project Xanadu and life extension. Drexler takes a Malthusian view of exponential growth within limits to growth. He also promotes space advocacy, arguing that, because the universe is essentially infinite, life can escape the limits to growth defined by Earth. Drexler supports a form of the Fermi paradox, arguing that as there is no evidence of alien civilizations, &quot;Thus for now, and perhaps forever, we can make plans for our future without concern for limits imposed by other civilizations.&quot;

==&quot;Nanosystems&quot; (1992)==
Drexler&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computation&quot; is a technical treatment of similar material. &quot;Nanosystems&quot; addresses chemical, thermodynamic, and other constraints on nanotechnology and manufacturing.

==&quot;Engines of Creation 2.0&quot; (2007)==
An updated version of the book, &quot;Engines of Creation 2.0&quot;, which includes more recent papers and publications, was published as a free ebook on February 8, 2007.

==Reception==
The book and the theories it presents have been the subject of some controversy. Scientists such as Nobel Laureate Richard Smalley and renowned chemist George M. Whitesides have been particularly critical. Smalley has engaged in open debate with Drexler, attacking the views presented for what he considered both the dubious nature of the science behind them, and the misleading effect on the public&#x27;s view of nanotechnology.

<text>The Persian Tobacco Protest () was a Twelver Shia Muslim revolt in Qajar Iran against an 1890 tobacco concession granted by Emperor Naser al-Din Shah Qajar to the British Empire, granting control over growth, sale, and export of tobacco to an Englishman, Major G. F. Talbot. The protest was held by merchants in major cities such as Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan in solidarity with the clerical establishment. It climaxed in a widely obeyed December 1891 fatwa against tobacco use issued by Grand Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi.

==Background==
Beginning in the 19th century, Qajar Iran found itself in a precarious situation due to an increasing foreign presence. Reeling from defeats in wars against the Russian Empire in 1813 and 1828, as well as the British Empire in 1857, not only was the Qajar government forced to grant countless concessions to foreign powers, but Iranian bazaaris (merchants) were left in a highly vulnerable position as they were unable to compete with the numerous economic advantages gained by merchants from Europe. According to the accounts of foreigners living in Iran at the time, the Qajar dynasty was highly unpopular among the populace and was perceived as having little concern for the welfare of its subjects. Later accounts by British eyewitnesses suggest that the reason why the dynasty had not been overthrown sooner in the face of widespread discontent was due to British and Russian intervention that essentially propped up the emperor.

In 1872, Emperor Naser al-Din negotiated a concession with Paul Reuter, a British citizen, granting him control over the roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The Reuter concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests, but also opposition from the Russian government. Under immense pressure, Naser al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers.

==The Tobacco Régie and subsequent protests==

On 20 March 1890, Emperor Naser al-Din granted a concession to Major G. F. Talbot for a full monopoly over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, Talbot paid the emperor an annual sum of £15,000 (present-day £1.845 million; $2.35 million) in addition to a quarter of the yearly profits after the payment of all expenses and a dividend of five percent on the capital. By the fall of 1890, the concession had been sold to the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia, a company which some have speculated was essentially Talbot himself as he heavily promoted shares in the corporation. At the time of the concession, the tobacco crop was valuable not only because of the domestic market but because Iranians cultivated a variety of tobacco &quot;much prized in foreign markets&quot; that was not grown elsewhere. The Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco in the Qajar Empire were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco at a price that was mutually agreed upon by the company and the sellers with disputes settled by compulsory arbitration.

At the time, the tobacco industry in Iran employed over 200,000 people and therefore the concession represented a major blow to farmers and bazaaris, whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Now they were forced to seek permits from the Tobacco Régie as well as required to inform the concessionaires of the amount of tobacco produced. In essence the concession not only violated the long-established relationship between Persian tobacco producers and tobacco sellers, but also threatened the job security of a significant portion of the population.

In September 1890, the first resounding protest against the concession manifested, however it did not emerge from the Persian merchant class or ulama but rather from the Russian government who stated that the Tobacco Régie violated freedom of trade in the region as stipulated by the Treaty of Turkmanchai. Despite disapproval from the Russian Empire, Naser al-Din Shah was intent on continuing the concession. In February 1891, Major G. F. Talbot traveled to Iran to install the Tobacco Régie, and soon thereafter, the Emperor made news of the concession public for the first time, sparking immediate disapproval throughout the country.

Despite the rising tensions, director of the Tobacco Régie Julius Ornstein arrived in Tehran in April and was assured by Prime Minister Amin al-Sultan that the concession had the full support of the House of Qajar. In the meantime, anonymous letters were being sent to high members of the government while placards were circulating in cities such as Tehran and Tabriz, both displaying public anger towards the granting of concessions to foreigners.

During the spring of 1891, mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities. Initially, it was the bazaaris who led the opposition under the conviction that it was their income and livelihood which were at stake. Affluent merchants such as Hajji Mohammad Kazem Malek el-Tojjar, the &quot;king of the merchants&quot;, played a vital role in the tobacco movement by organizing bazaari protests as well as appealing to well-known mujtahids for their support in opposing the Régie.

The ulama proved to be a highly valuable ally of the bazaaris as key religious leaders sought to protect national interests from foreign domination. Since the Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam after 1501, the ulama played a paramount role in society – they ran religious schools, maintained the charity of endowments, acted as arbiters and judges, and were seen as the intermediaries between God and Muslims in the country. If such exorbitant concessions were given to non-Muslim foreigners, the ulama believed the community under their supervision would be severely threatened. Furthermore, the ulama had ties with various merchant families and guilds while holding an economic interest in tobacco that was grown on waqf land. Finally, as the clergy pointed out, the concession directly contradicted sharia, because individuals were not allowed to purchase or sell tobacco of their own free will and were unable to go elsewhere for business. Later, during the tobacco harvest season of 1891, tobacco cultivator Mahmud Zaim of Kashan coordinated with two other major tobacco cultivators the burning of their entire stock.

The cities of Shiraz, Tabriz, and Tehran would subsequently develop into the most prominent centers of opposition to the tobacco concession. In May 1891, Sayyid Ali Akbar, a prominent mullah of Shiraz, was removed from the city by orders of the Emperor due to his preaching against the concession. During his departure, Ali Akbar met with prominent pan-Islamist activist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, and at Akbar&#x27;s request, al-Afghani wrote a letter to the leading cleric, Mirza Shirazi, asking the mujtahids to &quot;save and defend [the] country&quot; from &quot;this criminal who has offered the provinces of the land of Iran to auction amongst the Great Powers.&quot; Though Shirazi would later send a personal telegram to the shah warning the leader about the pitfalls of giving concessions to foreigners, this personal appeal did nothing to put an end to the Régie.

Government intervention may have helped in mitigating the hostilities in Shiraz following Akbar&#x27;s removal, however other regions of Iran still saw a proliferation in protests. Bazaaris in Tehran were among the first groups of people to protest against the concession by writing letters of disapproval to the emperor even before the concession was publicly announced. It has been argued that this initial opposition stemmed from a Russian attempt to stir up frustration within the merchant community of Tehran. Although Azarbaijan, the northwestern region, was not a tobacco-growing area, it saw tremendous opposition to the concession due to the large concentration of local merchants and retail traders in the region. In Isfahan, a boycott of the consumption of tobacco was implemented even before Shirazi&#x27;s fatwa, while in the city of Tabriz, the bazaar closed down and the ulama stopped teaching in the madrasas. The cities of Mashhad and Kerman also experienced demonstrations in opposition to the concession, yet historian Mansoor Moaddel argues that these latter movements were relatively ineffective. Other cities around the country such as Qazvin, Yazd, and Kermanshah were also involved in opposing the emperor and the Tobacco Régie.

==Shirazi&#x27;s fatwa and the repudiation of the concession==
In December 1891, a fatwa was issued by the most important religious authority in Iran, the &quot;marja&#x27;-i taqlid&quot; Mirza Shirazi: &quot;In the name of God, the Merciful, the Beneficent. Today the use of both varieties of tobacco, in whatever fashion is reckoned war against the Imam of the Age – may God hasten his advent.&quot; The reference to the Hidden Imam, a critical person in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, meant that Shirazi was using the strongest possible language to oppose the Régie.

Initially, there was skepticism over the legitimacy of the fatwa; however, Shirazi would later confirm the declaration.

Residents of the capital of Tehran refused to smoke tobacco and this collective response spread to neighboring provinces. In a show of solidarity, Iranian merchants responded by shutting down the main bazaars throughout the country. As the tobacco boycott grew larger, Naser al-Din Shah and Prime Minister Amin al-Sultan found themselves powerless to stop the popular movement fearing Russian intervention in case a civil war materialized.

Before the fatwa, tobacco consumption had been so prevalent in Iran that it was smoked everywhere, including inside mosques. European observers noted that &quot;most Iranians would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.&quot; Despite the popularity of tobacco, the religious ban was so successful that it was said that women in the Qajar harem quit smoking and his servants refused to prepare his water pipe.

By January 1892, when the shah saw that the British government &quot;was waffling in its support for the Imperial Tobacco Company,&quot; he canceled the concession. On 26 January 1892, &quot;the public crier in Tehran announced that Sheikh Shirazi had lifted the fatva.&quot;

The fatwa has been called a &quot;stunning&quot; demonstration of the power of the marja&#x27;-i taqlid, and the protest itself has been cited as one of the issues that led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution a few years later.

==Aftermath==
Following the cancellation of the concession, there were still difficulties between the Qajar government and the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia in terms of negotiating the amount of compensation that would be paid to the company. Eventually, it was decided that the sum was to be £500,000 ( , corresponding to 72,000,000$ ). While many Iranians were happy about preventing foreign commercial influence in the country, the tobacco movement had far greater implications than they would even realize. Historian Nikki Keddie notes that the movement was significant because &quot;Iranians saw for the first time that it was possible to win out against the Shah and foreign interests… there is a direct line from the coalition which participated in the tobacco movement… culminating in the Constitutional Revolution&quot; and arguably the Iranian Revolution as well.

For Naser Al-Din Shah, the protest left him both financially handicapped and publicly humiliated. Iran was forced to contract a loan from Russia and became a debtor state. At the end of his rule, Naser Al-Din became much more hostile towards the West, preventing any form of European education or travel.

<text>The NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) is an aeronautical research center operated by NASA. Its primary campus is located inside Edwards Air Force Base in California and is considered NASA&#x27;s premier site for aeronautical research. AFRC operates some of the most advanced aircraft in the world and is known for many aviation firsts, including supporting the first crewed airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight (Bell X-1), highest speed by a crewed, powered aircraft (North American X-15), the first pure digital fly-by-wire aircraft (F-8 DFBW), and many others. AFRC operated a second site next to Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, known as Building 703, once the former Rockwell International/North American Aviation production facility. There, AFRC housed and operated several of NASA&#x27;s Science Mission Directorate aircraft including SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy), a DC-8 Flying Laboratory, a Gulfstream C-20A UAVSAR and ER-2 High Altitude Platform. In 2024, following the retirements of SOFIA and the DC-8, NASA vacated Building 703, as the continued lease of the large hangar was no longer justified or a prudent use of taxpayer dollars. As of 2023, Bradley Flick is the center&#x27;s director.

Established as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Muroc Flight Test Unit (1946), the center was subsequently known as the NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station (1949), the NACA High-Speed Flight Station (1954), the NASA High-Speed Flight Station (1958) and the NASA Flight Research Center (1959). On 26 March 1976, the center was renamed the NASA Ames-Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) after Hugh L. Dryden, a prominent aeronautical engineer who died in office as NASA&#x27;s deputy administrator in 1965 and Joseph Sweetman Ames, who was an eminent physicist, and served as president of Johns Hopkins University. The facility took its current name on 1 March 2014, honoring Neil Armstrong, a former test pilot at the center and the first human being to walk on the Moon. 

AFRC was the home of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to Kennedy Space Center if one landed at Edwards.

The center long operated the oldest B-52 Stratofortress bomber, a B-52B (dubbed Balls 8 after its tail number, 008) that had been converted to a drop test aircraft. 008 dropped many supersonic test vehicles, from the X-15 to its last research program, the hypersonic X-43A, powered by a Pegasus rocket. Retired in 2004, the aircraft is on display near Edwards&#x27; North Gate.

== Location ==
Though Armstrong Flight Research Center has always been located on the shore of Rogers Dry Lake, its precise location has changed over the years. It currently resides on the northwestern edge of the lake bed, just south of North Gate. Visitors must obtain access to both Edwards AFB and NASA AFRC. 

The Rogers Dry Lake bed offers a unique landscape well suited for flight research: dry conditions, few rainy days per year, and large, flat, open spaces in which emergency landings can be performed. At times, the bed can host a runway length of over 40,000 feet. It is home to a compass rose that measures 5,200 feet across, and where aircraft can land into the wind in any direction.

== Historic projects ==

===Douglas Skyrocket===
NASA&#x27;s predecessor, the NACA, operated the Douglas Skyrocket. A successor to the Air Force&#x27;s Bell X-1, the D-558-II could operate under rocket or jet power. It conducted extensive tests into aircraft stability in the transsonic range, optimal supersonic wing configurations, rocket plume effects, and high-speed flight dynamics. On November 20, 1953, the Douglas Skyrocket became the first aircraft to fly at over twice the speed of sound when it attained a speed of Mach 2.005. Like the X-1, the D-558-II could be air-launched using a B-29 Superfortress. Unlike the X-1, the Skyrocket could also takeoff from a runway with the help of JATO units.

===Controlled Impact Demonstration===
The Controlled Impact Demonstration was a joint project with the Federal Aviation Administration to research a new jet fuel that would decrease the damage due to fire in the crash of a large airliner. On 1 December 1984, a remotely piloted Boeing 720 aircraft was flown into specially built &quot;wing openers&quot; which tore the wings open, fuel spraying everywhere. Despite the new fuel additive, the resulting fireball was huge; the fire still took an hour to fully extinguish.

Even though the fuel additive did not prevent a fire, the research was not a complete failure. The additive still prevented the combustion of some fuel which flowed over the fuselage of the aircraft, and served to cool it, similar to how a conventional rocket engine cools its nozzle. Also, instrumented crash test dummies were in the airplane for the impact, and provided valuable research into other aspects of crash survivability for the occupants.

===Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment===
LASRE was a NASA experiment in cooperation with Lockheed Martin to study a reusable launch vehicle design based on a linear aerospike rocket engine. The experiment&#x27;s goal was to provide in-flight data to help Lockheed Martin validate the computational predictive tools they developed to design the craft. LASRE was a small, half-span model of a lifting body with eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine. The experiment, mounted on the back of an SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, operated like a kind of &quot;flying wind tunnel.&quot;

The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle&#x27;s engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting-body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching approximately . The interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume could create drag; design refinements look to minimize that interaction.

===Lunar Landing Research Vehicle===
The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle or LLRV was an Apollo Project era program to build a simulator for the Moon landing. The LLRVs, humorously referred to as &quot;Flying Bedsteads,&quot; were used by the FRC, now known as the Armstrong Flight Research Center, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, to study and analyze piloting techniques needed to fly and land the Apollo Lunar Module in the moon&#x27;s airless environment.

<text>The Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party of Germany (, DBD) was an East German political party. The DBD was founded in 1948. It had 52 representatives in the Volkskammer, as part of the National Front. The DBD participated in all GDR cabinets (with the exception of the last GDR cabinet). The founding of the DBD was an attempt by the SED to weaken the influence of CDU/LDPD in the rural community by establishing a party loyal to the SED. The leadership cadre came mainly from the ranks of the SED. In the late 1980s, the party had 117,000 members.

After the fall of Berlin Wall, the party initially tried to find itself a niche as ecological agrarian party, but the first free Volkskammer election (1990) netted it only nine seats. In 1990 the DBD merged with the Christian Democratic Union.

==International contacts==

The DBD had friendly relations with peasants&#x27; parties in other Eastern Bloc countries. It had close contacts with the Polish United People&#x27;s Party (Zjednoczone Stronnictwo Ludowe, ZSL) and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (Bǔlgarski Zemedelski Naroden Sǔyuz, BZNS). Besides that, there were some contacts with farmers&#x27; associations in West Germany. They had also some contacts with agrarian parties in Finland (Centre Party) and in Sweden (Centre Party).

== Electoral history ==

=== Volkskammer elections ===

==Chairmen of the DBD==
* Ernst Goldenbaum, 1948–1982
* Ernst Mecklenburg, 1982–1987
* Günther Maleuda, 1987–1990
* Ulrich Junghanns, 1990
