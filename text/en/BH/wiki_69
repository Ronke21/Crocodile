<text>Maria Ellen Cantwell (; born October 13, 1958) is an American politician who is the junior United States senator from Washington since 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993, and in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995.

Born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cantwell graduated from Miami University before moving to Seattle to work on Alan Cranston&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign. In 1986, she was elected to the state house of representatives, where she served until her election to Congress in 1992. Cantwell served one term in Congress before losing her seat to Republican Rick White in the 1994 election. She then briefly worked in the private sector as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks.

Despite having vowed to remain out of politics, Cantwell ran for the United States Senate in 2000. She defeated Republican incumbent Slade Gorton in one of the closest elections in the state&#x27;s history. Cantwell was reelected in 2006, 2012, 2018, and 2024. After Jeff Sessions resigned from the Senate in February 2017 to become United States Attorney General, Cantwell became the most senior junior senator. She is the second female senator from Washington, after Patty Murray.
==Early life, education, and early political career==
Cantwell was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in a predominantly Irish American neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis. Her father, Paul Cantwell, served as county commissioner, city councilor, state legislator, and chief of staff for U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr.; he was the Democratic nominee for Mayor of Indianapolis in 1979. Her mother, Rose, was an administrative assistant. Her ancestry includes Irish and German.

Cantwell attended Emmerich Manual High School, and was inducted into the Indianapolis Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2006. After high school, Cantwell attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in public administration.

A year after graduating, Cantwell worked on Jerry Springer&#x27;s unsuccessful 1982 Ohio gubernatorial campaign. Cantwell moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1983, to campaign for U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace, because it reminded her of Indianapolis, and led a successful campaign in 1986 to build a new library there. As of 2000, Cantwell lived in Edmonds, Washington with her mother.

==Washington House of Representatives (1987–1993)==
===Elections===
In 1986, Cantwell was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives at the age of 28. She defeated George Dahlquist 54%–46%. In 1988, she was reelected with 66% of the vote. In 1990, she was reelected to a third term with 61% of the vote.

===Tenure===
As a state representative, Cantwell helped write Washington&#x27;s Growth Management Act of 1990, which required cities to develop comprehensive growth plans, and she negotiated its passage. She also worked on legislation regulating nursing homes. Cantwell resigned on January 3, 1993, in preparation to be sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–1995)==
===Elections===
;1992
In the November election, Cantwell defeated Republican State Senator Gary A. Nelson 55%–42%. She became the first Democrat elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington&#x27;s first congressional district in 40 years.

;1994
Republican Rick White defeated Cantwell 52%–48% in the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections. Before that year&#x27;s &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;, eight of the nine representatives from the Washington state delegation were from the Democratic Party. After the election, five Democratic representatives from Washington state lost their positions, despite running for re-election, including Cantwell, future governor Jay Inslee, and Speaker of the House Tom Foley.

===Tenure===
Cantwell was called a &quot;savvy, pro-business Democrat&quot;. She supported President Clinton&#x27;s 1993 budget, which raised taxes and passed without the votes of many Democrats. During her only term, she helped persuade the Clinton administration to terminate its support of the Clipper chip. She wrote a letter to Vice President Al Gore and staunchly opposed it because Microsoft Inc. was in her district. She voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

===Committee assignments===
*Public Works
*Foreign Affairs
*Merchant Marine and Fisheries

==Private sector employment (1995–1999)==
After her defeat, Cantwell vowed to leave politics. Political ally Rob Glaser offered her a job as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks. Among her accomplishments was the live internet streaming broadcast of a Mariners-Yankees baseball game in 1995, which marked the start of internet broadcasts of Major League Baseball games.

In 1998, the company was criticized by privacy groups, which alleged that the RealJukebox software program incorporated spyware to track unsuspecting users&#x27; listening patterns and download history. In response, RealNetworks amended its privacy policy to fully disclose its privacy practices regarding user listening patterns. Subsequently, RealNetworks submitted to independent outside audits of its privacy practices. Several lawsuits regarding alleged privacy violations were settled out of court. This incident has shaped her views on privacy and her opposition to the Bush administration&#x27;s post-9/11 policies.

==U.S. Senate (2001–present)==
===Elections===

==== 2000 ====
At the urging of party activists and officials, Cantwell formed an exploratory committee in October 1999 to consider a run for U.S. Senate against Democrat Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn and incumbent Republican Senator Slade Gorton. She committed to the race on January 19, 2000. Cantwell entered the campaign a year after Senn, who was endorsed by the Washington State Labor Council and NARAL, and used her personal wealth to fund television advertisements. Early on, privacy became an issue; Senn cited her record protecting medical privacy as insurance commissioner, while Cantwell promoted internet privacy and cited her opposition to the Clipper chip. Senn later used television advertisements to accuse Cantwell of avoiding debates, as she had agreed to two debates while Senn preferred more. They participated in three debates, during which they attacked each other. Senn attacked RealNetworks and Cantwell&#x27;s role in the company; Cantwell accused Senn of wanting to run against RealNetworks, and said that Senn was uninformed on internet issues. Cantwell was endorsed by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, and &quot;The News Tribune&quot;. She easily won her party&#x27;s nomination, defeating Senn by a 3–1 margin in the primary. Although he won re-nomination, Gorton got fewer votes than Cantwell and Senn&#x27;s combined total.

Social security, prescription drugs, dams, gun control, and campaign finance reform were among the most important issues in Cantwell&#x27;s race against Gorton, which drew national attention. Cantwell also adopted the slogan &quot;Your voice for a change&quot;, a veiled reference to Gorton&#x27;s campaign theme in 1980, challenging incumbent Warren Magnuson&#x27;s age. She said Gorton supported &quot;19th-century solutions to 21st-century problems&quot;. Cantwell was endorsed by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; and the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, the state&#x27;s two biggest newspapers. Gorton was endorsed by the smaller &quot;The News Tribune&quot; and two of the largest Eastern Washington newspapers, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; and &quot;Tri-City Herald&quot;. At times, the campaign was accused of pettiness as national PACs and groups funded television attack advertisements. After a Cantwell campaign worker deep-linked to a humorous photo on Gorton&#x27;s website, he accused Cantwell&#x27;s campaign of hacking, and Senn accused Cantwell of hypocrisy. &quot;Fiddling with people&#x27;s websites and calling it good fun ... adds a very childish and unworthy character to the race&quot;, Senn&#x27;s campaign spokeswoman Barbara Stenson said. Cantwell spent over $10 million of her own money on her campaign, pledging not to accept money from PACs. When RealNetworks stock declined at the end of 2000, she spent time raising funds for debt retirement, but kept her pledge not to accept PAC money. In the waning weeks of the campaign, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Cantwell violated federal campaign finance law by securing $3.8 million in bank loans for her campaign and failing to properly disclose the loans until January 30, 2001. The complaint alleged that she had received a $600,000 line of credit without sufficient collateral, and another $1,000,000, all at a preferential interest rate. After review, the Federal Election Commission sent a letter of admonishment, saying that the loans were &quot;made on a basis that assures repayment, and that each loan bore the usual and customary interest rate&quot;.

The election was among the closest in Washington history. Cantwell held a tiny lead in the initial returns on election night, but the race remained too close to call. Gorton overtook her the next day, amassing a lead of 12,500 votes by the second week of absentee ballot counting. The election result was certified on November 22 with a lead of 1,953 votes for Cantwell out of 2.5 million cast, credited to support from the Puget Sound region. The 0.08% margin triggered an automatic recount, which increased her lead to 2,229 votes, or 0.09%. It was the last Senate race to be called in the 2000 election, which resulted in a 50–50 tie ahead of a contentious presidential election recount. Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan became the third and fourth women to defeat incumbent senators, following Kay Bailey Hutchison&#x27;s 1993 and Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s 1992 special-election victories.

==== 2006 ====
The close 2004 gubernatorial race between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi suggested to many that the 2006 contest might go either way. Both Cantwell and her opponent Republican Mike McGavick dominated their primaries; initial speculation favored a Republican victory. &quot;At one point&quot;, wrote analyst Larry Sabato, &quot;all the talk in this race concerned Cantwell&#x27;s cool relations with anti-war Democratic elements and McGavick&#x27;s relatively united base. But Democrats appear to have closed ranks behind their junior senator.&quot; Cantwell was reelected by a 17-point margin, even winning several traditionally Republican counties in Eastern Washington, including Spokane County. 

During the 2006 campaign, Cantwell received heavy criticism for declining most of the invitations she received to debate McGavick in public fora. Media outlets across the state, including &quot;The Olympian&quot; and the &quot;Yakima Herald-Republic&quot;, rebuked her, claiming she was afraid to confront McGavick, calling it &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;simply not fair&quot;. Cantwell agreed to two debates with McGavick in Seattle and Spokane, lasting 60 and 30 minutes, respectively. When she ran for Senate in 2000 against Gorton, Gorton also agreed to only two debates of a similar format. Similarly, when Washington&#x27;s senior senator, Patty Murray, ran for reelection in 2004, she agreed to only two debates with George Nethercutt, although each debate lasted an hour.

==== 2012 ====

Cantwell was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican State Senator Michael Baumgartner.

==== 2018 ====

Cantwell was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican Susan Hutchison.

==== 2024 ====

Cantwell was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Republican Raul Garcia.

===Tenure===
Cantwell was a proponent of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill of 2002, and co-sponsored the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act of 2001. In 2005, she wrote a letter in support of the Perkins Loan program, and told the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; in July 2006 that she opposed Social Security privatization. Cantwell co-sponsored the &quot;Pension Fairness and Full Disclosure Act of 2005&quot;.

Also in 2005, Cantwell voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which angered many who opposed free trade agreements. Others argued that due to the state&#x27;s unique economy, any senator from Washington almost had to vote for free trade pacts.

Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote not to confirm United States Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, citing his potential views on abortion and the environment, . In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, Cantwell, 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion. The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster Alito&#x27;s confirmation led by Senators John Kerry and Ted Kennedy. Alito was confirmed the next day by a vote of 58–42, with most Democrats, including Cantwell, voting against confirmation.

In 2010, Cantwell voted to invoke cloture to begin debate on the Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy in the military.

In the 2016 United States presidential election, Cantwell received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.

Cantwell has led efforts to improve internet privacy laws.

In 2024, Cantwell crafted legislation to require airline passengers to request a refund for a canceled flight rather than automatically receiving one.

====Abortion and contraceptives====
Cantwell has expressed support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she co-sponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to family planning and preventative methods as a means to reduce unwanted pregnancies. It included giving women access to Plan B, as well as expanding Medicaid to cover family planning. As an advocate of increasing access to family planning and sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary to reduce unwanted pregnancies. She was criticized by her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that she was too extreme and too far to the left of Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds getting these drugs without a prescription.

Cantwell calls herself &quot;100% pro-choice&quot;, and consistently supports the pro-choice movement&#x27;s positions. She was one of 34 senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which President George W. Bush signed into law. She also voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which made it an additional crime to kill or harm a fetus during a criminal assault upon the mother. That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 61–38, and was signed into law by Bush in 2004.

====Environment and energy====
Cantwell opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and was one of the most vocal critics of the increase of oil and gasoline prices during 2008. Advocating increased regulation of futures markets and windfall profits taxes on oil profits, she has drawn scathing criticism from the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. In 2005, Cantwell scored what many perceived as one of the biggest victories of her first term when she blocked Senator Ted Stevens&#x27;s efforts to allow drilling in ANWR. Stevens attached the measure to a bill that provided money for defense spending and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Cantwell rounded up the votes of 41 Democrats and three Republicans, enough to block a final vote. Stevens removed the ANWR drilling measure from the larger bill, promising to bring the matter up at a later date.

In 2004, Cantwell received the highest rating possible from the League of Conservation Voters for her environmental voting record. As of 2020, she has a lifetime score of 93% on the League&#x27;s National Environmental Scorecard. She is known for supporting alternative energy research and for protecting Washington&#x27;s forests from logging and the construction of paved roads and has been endorsed by various prominent environmental advocacy groups. She has opposed drilling in ANWR on multiple occasions, has voted to reduce oil usage by 40% by 2025, and has opposed legislation to relax or terminate CAFE standards. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; has called Cantwell&#x27;s environmental record &quot;pristine&quot;, and the Wilderness Society has called her an &quot;environmental champion&quot;.

In 2009, Cantwell introduced the Carbon Limits and Energy for America&#x27;s Renewal (CLEAR) Act (S. 2877), also called the Cantwell-Collins bill, a &quot;cap and dividend&quot; emissions trading proposal. Senator Susan Collins co-sponsored it. The bill died in the Senate Finance Committee without debate or votes.

Cantwell chaired the Senate Democrats 20/20 Energy Independence campaign and co-chaired the Apollo Alliance in 2006. One of her main accomplishments was the passage of an amendment &quot;To prevent energy market manipulation&quot;, which passed 57–40 in the Senate in November 2006; a previous effort was defeated by a vote of 50–48.

In 2011, The Humane Society of the United States praised Cantwell&#x27;s no-tolerance policy and effective removal of the practice of shark finning, which kills an estimated 73 million sharks per year.

In February 2019, in response to reports that the EPA intended to decide against setting limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in drinking water as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Cantwell was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).&quot;

In September 2019, Cantwell was one of eight senators to sign a bipartisan letter to congressional leadership, requesting full and lasting funding of the Land and Water Conservation Act, in order to aid national parks and public lands, benefit the $887 billion American outdoor recreation economy, and &quot;ensure much-needed investment in our public lands and continuity for the state, tribal, and non-federal partners who depend on them&quot;.

====Foreign policy====
=====Criticism of Amanda Knox&#x27;s wrongful conviction=====
On December 4, 2009, the day that an Italian court wrongly convicted 22-year-old Washingtonian Amanda Knox of the murder of Meredith Kercher, Cantwell released a statement expressing her dismay, saying she had &quot;serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted [the] trial.&quot; She called the evidence against Knox insufficient, said Knox had been subjected to &quot;harsh treatment&quot; after her arrest, and said there had been &quot;negligence&quot; in the handling of evidence. She also complained that jurors had not been sequestered, allowing them to view &quot;negative news coverage&quot; about Knox, and that one of the prosecutors had a misconduct case pending in relation to another trial. Cantwell said she would seek assistance from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A State Department spokesman said in December 2009 that the department had followed the case closely and would continue to do so. He added: &quot;It is still in the early days but ... we haven&#x27;t received any indications necessarily that Italian law was not followed.&quot; Knox was later exonerated.

=====Iraq War=====
On October 11, 2002, Cantwell voted in favor of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. Her October 10, 2002, press release, quotes her as stating on the floor of the U.S. Senate, &quot;Mr. President, my vote for this resolution does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all the questions. I believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action.&quot; Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: &quot;First: Continued Multilateral Approach ... Second: Successful Military Strategy ... Third: A Post-War Commitment Strategy ... Fourth: Fighting the Broader War on Terrorism ... Fifth: Maintaining Middle East Stability ... Sixth: Protecting Iraqi Civilians.&quot;

In 2006, Cantwell voted against the Kerry-Feingold Amendment to S. 2766, which would have set a timetable for al, but for the Levin-Reed Amendment, which would encourage beginning a phased withdrawal by the end of the year, with no timetable for completion.

=====Israel=====
In April 2017, Cantwell co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which would have made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

====Health care reform====
Cantwell supports health care reform in the United States, and was a co-sponsor of Senator Ron Wyden&#x27;s Healthy Americans Act. In her role as a member of the Finance Committee, she had an influential role in crafting health care reform legislation. On September 29, 2009, when the Finance Committee considered health care reform legislation, Cantwell supported amendments to establish a public health care option that would compete with private insurers.

In 2009, &quot;The Stranger&quot; ran an article on Cantwell&#x27;s opposition to the inclusion of a public option in the health-care reform plan. They reported: &quot;Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative &quot;Seattle Times&quot; editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to a recent poll. So what&#x27;s going on with Washington&#x27;s junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn&#x27;t she want Congress to include a public option — a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone, and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs — in its health-care-reform package?&quot; Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the Senate as the reason for her opposition.

==== LGBTQ+ Rights ====
In 2022, Cantwell voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.

====Immigration====
In 2006, Cantwell, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611). This legislation included provisions to improve border security, increased fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, created a guest worker program (which included a near doubling of the number of H1-B visas), and created a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country. The bill, with support from Republican leadership, passed 62–36. Debate would have also commenced on the DREAM Act, but was halted by a Republican filibuster.

==== Minimum wage ====
In March 2021, Cantwell was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a $15 hourly minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan.

====Sexual abuse in Olympic sports====
Cantwell chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC), the United States Center for SafeSport (SafeSport), and the issue of sexual abuse in Olympic sports. She has praised the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, crafted to protect athletes from emotional and physical abuse and harassment, which created SafeSport to prevent and respond to misconduct.

====Support for fellow Democrats====
Cantwell is a major supporter of fellow Democratic candidates for public office. In 2006, facing her own challenging race, she used ActBlue to raise $100,000 for Darcy Burner, Peter J. Goldmark, and Richard Wright, all of whom were facing difficult House races in Washington. In the 2008 cycle, Cantwell was particularly committed to supporting Senator Mary Landrieu&#x27;s reelection.
On December 31, 2007, Cantwell became the 10th senator to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. She supported Clinton throughout the primaries, but vowed to vote for the winner of the pledged delegates. After Clinton conceded on June 7, Cantwell endorsed Obama. At the Washington State Democratic Convention on June 15, she said: &quot;I do want to see a strong Democratic woman in the White House ... That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so glad Michelle Obama will be the next first lady.&quot;

On October 20, 2013, Cantwell was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.

==Personal life==
In 2006, it emerged that court files concerning a loan Cantwell made in 2001 to her former boyfriend, boss, and campaign manager, lobbyist Ron Dotzauer, to help him through his divorce litigation, had been sealed. A Sound Politics reporter had the file unsealed and discovered that Cantwell was identified in the divorce records &quot;as the &#x27;other woman&#x27;&quot;.

Cantwell was also formerly in a relationship with Seattle-based track and cross country star Scott Daggatt, then serving as a stockbroker of a Seattle-based National Securities Corporation.

Owing to a sharp decrease in the value of her RealNetworks stock, Cantwell&#x27;s personal fortune had declined significantly by 2011.

<doc id="333606" wikidata="Q925643" url="?curid=333606" title="List of chicken breeds">
<text>There are hundreds of chicken breeds in existence. Domesticated for thousands of years, distinguishable breeds of chicken have been present since the combined factors of geographical isolation and selection for desired characteristics created regional types with distinct physical and behavioral traits passed on to their offspring.

The physical traits used to distinguish chicken breeds are size, plumage color, comb type, skin color, number of toes, amount of feathering, egg color, and place of origin. They are also roughly divided by primary use, whether for eggs, meat, or ornamental purposes, and with some considered to be dual-purpose.

In the 21st century, chickens are frequently bred according to predetermined breed standards set down by governing organizations. The first of such standards was the British Poultry Standard, which is still in publication today. Other standards include the Standard of Perfection, the Australian Poultry Standard, and the standard of the American Bantam Association, which deals exclusively with bantam fowl. Only some of the known breeds are included in these publications, and only those breeds are eligible to be shown competitively. There are additionally a few hybrid strains which are common in the poultry world, especially in large poultry farms. These types are first generation crosses of true breeds. Hybrids do not reliably pass on their features to their offspring, but are highly valued for their producing abilities.

==By primary use==
All chickens lay eggs, have edible meat, and possess a unique appearance. However, distinct breeds are the result of selective breeding to emphasize certain traits. Any breed may be used for general agricultural purposes, and all breeds are shown to some degree. But each chicken breed is known for a primary use.

===Eggs===

Many breeds were selected and are used primarily for producing eggs, these are mostly light-weight birds whose hens do not go broody often.
===Meat===
Most farms and homesteads use dual-purpose breeds for meat production. Some breeds are raised mainly for meat:
===Dual-purpose===

The generalist breeds used in barnyards worldwide are adaptable utility birds good at producing both meat and eggs. Though some may be slightly better for one of these purposes, they are usually called &quot;dual-purpose&quot; breeds.

===Exhibition===
Since the 19th century, poultry fancy, the breeding and competitive exhibition of poultry as a hobby, has grown to be a huge influence on chicken breeds. Many breeds have always been kept for ornamental purposes, and others have been shifted from their original use to become first and foremost exhibition fowl, even if they may retain some inherent utility. Since the sport of cockfighting has been outlawed in the developed world, most breeds first developed for this purpose, called game fowl, are now seen principally in the show ring rather than the cock pit as fighting cocks.

==Bantams==

Most large chicken breeds have a bantam counterpart, sometimes referred to as a &quot;miniature&quot;. Miniatures are usually one-fifth to one-quarter the size of the standard breed, but they are expected to exhibit all of the standard breed&#x27;s characteristics. A &quot;true bantam&quot; has no large counterpart, and is naturally small. The true bantams include:

==Crossbreeds==
Many common strains of crossbred chickens exist, but none breed true or are recognized by poultry breed standards; thus, though they are extremely common in flocks focusing on high productivity, crossbreeds do not technically meet the definition of a breed. Most crossbreed strains are sex linked, allowing for easy chick sexing.

<text>Russell Louis &quot;Rusty&quot; Schweickart (also Schweikart; born October 25, 1935) is an American aeronautical engineer, and a former NASA astronaut, research scientist, U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, as well as a former business executive and government executive.

Schweickart was selected in 1963 for NASA&#x27;s third astronaut group. He was the Lunar Module Pilot on the 1969 Apollo 9 mission, the first crewed flight test of the lunar module, on which he performed the first in-space test of the portable life support system used by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon. As backup commander of the first crewed Skylab mission in 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of the Skylab station. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA&#x27;s Office of Applications.

Schweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years as California Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown to California&#x27;s Energy Commission for five and a half years, serving as chairman for three.

In 1984–85, Schweickart co-founded the Association of Space Explorers and later in 2002 co-founded the B612 Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts, along with fellow former astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chair emeritus.

== Early life and education ==

Rusty Schweickart was born October 25, 1935, in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and grew up on a &quot;hardscrabble&quot; farm of producing hay and vegetables plus raising poultry and cows. As a youth his ambition was to be a pilot and a cowboy. After graduating from Manasquan High School in 1952, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering on scholarship (1956) and a Master of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics (1963) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class. His hobbies include golf, bicycling, and hiking. He was married twice and has seven children.

His family&#x27;s stated annual income when he received his Massachusetts Institute of Technology scholarship after graduating high school was listed as $1800 ().

== Military and NASA career ==
Schweickart served in the U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard (101st Tactical Fighter Squadron) from 1956 to 1963, with over 4,000 hours of flight time, including 3,500 hours in high performance jet aircraft.

Prior to joining NASA, Schweickart was a research scientist at the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work there involved research upper atmospheric physics, star tracking and stabilization of stellar images. His thesis for a master&#x27;s degree at MIT concerned stratospheric radiance.

Schweickart was chosen as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in October 1963. He was the youngest in the group. The third group of astronauts performed jungle training. Schweickart partnered with Clifton Williams. On March 21, 1966, he was named as the backup pilot for Roger B. Chaffee on Apollo 1—which was to have been the first crewed Apollo flight but was destroyed during a ground test accident. His fellow crewmen were backup Command Pilot James McDivitt and Senior Pilot David Scott, both veterans of Project Gemini. In December 1966, this crew was promoted to fly the first crewed Earth orbital test of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), with Schweickart as Lunar Module Pilot.

=== Spaceflight experience ===

Apollo 9 was flown in March 1969. Schweickart spent just over 241 hours in space, and performed the first extravehicular activity (EVA) of the Apollo program, testing the portable life support system that was later used by the twelve astronauts who walked on the Moon. The flight plan called for him to demonstrate an emergency transfer from the lunar module to the command module (CM) using handrails on the LM, but he began to suffer from space adaptation syndrome on the first day in orbit, forcing the postponement of the EVA.

Eventually, he improved enough to perform a relatively brief EVA with his feet restrained on the LM &quot;porch&quot; (a platform used in transferring to the descent ladder), while Command Module Pilot Scott performed a stand-up EVA through the open hatch of the CM. During a five-minute pause tethered outside his spacecraft, Schweickart felt he underwent a metaphysical experience as he stared at the Earth, contemplating its place in the universe. He subsequently practiced Transcendental Meditation based on his experience.

=== Skylab and beyond ===
Although Deke Slayton (who was responsible for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart &quot;would have been a logical lunar module pilot&quot; on subsequent lunar missions—indeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew for Apollo 12 and the prime crew of Apollo 15 —&quot;that bout of space sickness had everybody worried ... it didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea to put him back in ... at this point.&quot; Following his mission, Schweickart &quot;basically called the shot that I really didn&#x27;t want to be assigned to a flight until we knew more about motion sickness&quot; and became &quot;[a] motion sickness guinea pig&quot; for six months; while &quot;[he] didn&#x27;t learn that much&quot; during the testing, it is now accepted that as many as half of space travelers suffer from space adaptation syndrome to some extent.

The protracted testing period also contributed to Schweickart not being assigned to the Apollo 12 backup crew. When he returned to Houston, &quot;Al Shepard [Slayton&#x27;s deputy], for whatever reason, instead of putting me back on Apollo, put me on to Skylab ... Al had his own agenda of who went where and whatnot. So I cycled into Skylab at the time.&quot; Schweickart has also observed that he was &quot;not one of Al&#x27;s boys&quot;, alluding to the political liberalism that he shared with his then-wife, Clare; Slayton felt that her fervent political stances (including civil rights activism) &quot;caused him a few problems with his colleagues.&quot; During this period, a Houston radio broadcaster characterized Schweickart as &quot;the closest thing to a freak astronaut&quot; after he was photographed escorting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a tour of NASA&#x27;s headquarters.

Along with backup science pilot Story Musgrave and backup pilot Bruce McCandless II, Schweickart was assigned as backup commander of Skylab 2, the first crewed American space station mission, which flew during the spring of 1973. Following the loss of the space station&#x27;s thermal shield during launch, he assumed responsibility for the development of hardware and procedures for erecting an emergency solar shade and deploying a jammed solar array wing, operations that saved the space station.

After serving on the support crew of Skylab 4, Schweickart was more interested in cultivating managerial skills than &quot;[going] over to the Space Shuttle development work which was under way ... by that time, I had, you know, done a lot of work on Gemini in a support role, and then, of course, everything on Apollo, and now all of this on Skylab, and to go cycle back into the very beginning of the Space Shuttle, which was not going to fly for, at that point, something like six years and best guess of anybody in the business was maybe eight years, I figured, you know, another eight years of basically going to the same kinds of meetings, making the same kinds of decisions, going to the same places ... it was like &#x27;been there, done that.&#x27;&quot;

While retaining his flight status, he was reassigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as Director of User Affairs in the Office of Applications in 1974. In this capacity, he was responsible for transferring NASA technology (primarily Landsat 1 applications) to the outside world and working with technology users (including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and water resources managers) to bring an understanding of their needs into NASA. He came to regard this as a &quot;thankless position&quot; and a &quot;very hard sell&quot; to potential clients due to their intrinsic resistance to new processes; this and the dearth of immediate flight opportunities ultimately precipitated his departure from NASA in 1977.

== Post-NASA career ==
Schweickart then served for two years as California Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s assistant for science and technology before being appointed by Brown to the California Energy Commission for five and a half years.

Inspired by his friendship with Michael Murphy and involvement in the Esalen Institute&#x27;s Soviet-American Exchange Program, Schweickart established the Association of Space Explorers (ASE) in 1984–85 along with cosmonauts Alexei Leonov, Vitaly Sevastyanov, and Georgi Grechko; the organization is open to all people who have flown in orbit around the Earth. He also chaired the ASE&#x27;s near-Earth object committee, which produced a benchmark report and submitted it to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) on &quot;Asteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response&quot;.

Schweickart retired from ALOHA Networks, Inc. in 1998 where he served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1996 through 1998. ALOHA was a data communications company specializing in high performance, wireless internet access equipment.

Schweickart was formerly the Executive Vice President of CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems. Schweickart led CTA&#x27;s efforts in developing the GEMnet system, a second generation LEO communication satellite constellation designed to provide regular commercial electronic messaging services on a global basis. Prior to his CTA work, Schweickart founded and was President of Courier Satellite Services, Inc., a global satellite communications company that developed LEO satellites to provide worldwide affordable data services.

Schweickart&#x27;s satellite and telecommunications work involved him in the development of international communications regulations and policies, including participation in the 1992 and 1995 World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). He served at the 1995 WRC as a U.S. delegate. He also worked extensively in Russia and the former Soviet Union on scientific and telecommunications matters.

In 2002 he co-founded the B612 Foundation along with fellow former-astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists, also serving as its Chair. The B612 Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts.

In May 2005 Schweickart testified before the U.S. Congress on the dangers of an asteroid impact related to 99942 Apophis. and in 2010 served as the co-chairman, along with astronaut Tom Jones, NASA Advisory Council&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; Task Force on Planetary Defense. He has been an advocate of increasing NASA&#x27;s annual budget by $250M–$300M over a 10-year period to more fully catalog the NEOs that can pose a threat to Earth and also provide a deflection capability.

Schweickart has also spoken and taught at the Esalen Institute, and currently serves as the B612 Foundation&#x27;s Chair Emeritus.

== Organizations ==
Schweickart is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the International Academy of Astronautics, and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is also an honorary trustee and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.

== Awards and honors ==
He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1969) and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale De la Vaulx Medal (1970) for his Apollo 9 flight. He also received the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award (Emmy Award) in 1969 for transmitting the first live TV pictures from space. In 1973, Schweickart was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for his leadership role in the Skylab rescue efforts. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983 and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. Main-belt asteroid was named in his honor.

In 2012, Schweickart was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

In 1892, his grandfather Jacques Schweickart emigrated from Lembach, a small town located in Alsace, France, to the United States. After visiting Lembach several times, Schweickart has been awarded honorary citizenship of the town.

== Biographies and portrayals ==
In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Schweickart is portrayed by Kieran Mulroney. He also appeared in the television series &quot;The Universe&quot; in the episodes &quot;The End of the Earth: Deep Space Threats to Our Planet&quot; and &quot;Stopping Armageddon&quot;.

<doc id="333614" wikidata="Q12512922" url="?curid=333614" title="History of homosexuality">
<text>Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place. Attitudes to male homosexuality have varied from requiring males to engage in same-sex relationships to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. In addition, it has varied as to whether any negative attitudes towards men who have sex with men have extended to all participants, as has been common in Abrahamic religions, or only to passive (penetrated) participants, as was common in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Female homosexuality has historically been given less acknowledgment, explicit acceptance, and opposition. 

Homosexuality was generally accepted in many ancient and medieval eastern cultures such as those influenced by Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. Homophobia in the eastern world is often discussed in the context of being an import from the western world, with some contending that definitions of &quot;progress&quot; on homosexuality (e.g. LGBT rights) as being Western-centric. 

It is thought that ancient Assyria (2nd millennium BC to 1st millennium AD) viewed homosexuality as negative and at least criminal, with the religious codes of Zoroastrianism forbidding homosexuality, and the rise of Judaism, Christianity and Islam leading to homophobia in much of the western world; the majority of the ancient sources prior to the onset of the Abrahamic religions present homosexuality in the form of male domination or rape. Abrahamic religions played a key role in the spread of homophobia in further Asia, such as Islam through the Mongol Empire (where homosexuality was banned) to parts of Central Asia, Southern Asia and the Sinosphere, or Christianity through the numerous colonial adventures of European nations.

European Enlightenment ideas contributed to the French revolutionaries indirectly decriminalising gay sex in 1789 as part of the separation of secular and religious laws, though homophobia remained rampant in both secular and religious governments in an attempt to uphold the &quot;highest moral standards&quot;. The 19th century later saw the first homosexual movement in Germany, particularly in the aftermath of World War I. The modern LGBTQ rights movement emerged in the 20th century with the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York.

Many male historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian, have had terms such as &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;bisexual&quot; applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary social construct of sexuality foreign to their times, though others challenge this. A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

==The Americas==
=== Pre-colonization Indigenous societies ===
Among Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary Native American and First Nations communities, these roles still exist. While each Indigenous culture has their own names for these individuals, a modern, pan-Indian term that was adopted in 1990 is &quot;Two-Spirit&quot;. This new term has not been universally accepted, having been criticized by traditional communities who already have their own terms for the people being grouped under this &quot;urban neologism&quot;, and by those who reject what they call the &quot;western&quot; binary implications, such as implying that Natives believe these individuals are &quot;both male and female&quot;. However, it has generally met with more acceptance than the anthropological term it replaced.

Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, and the Tupinambá of Brazil.
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the &quot;berdaches&quot; (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public execution, burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.

=== Post-colonization ===
==East Asia==
In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

=== China ===
Homosexuality is widely documented in ancient China and attitudes towards it varied through time, location, and social class. Chinese literature recorded multiple anecdotes of men engaging in homosexual relationships. In the story of &quot;the leftover peach&quot;(余桃), set during the Spring and Autumn Era, the historian Han Fei recorded an anecdote in the relationship of Mi Zixia (彌子瑕) and Duke Ling of Wei (衛靈公) in which Mizi Xia shared an especially delicious peach with his lover. The story of the cut sleeve(断袖) recorded the Emperor Ai of Han sharing a bed with his lover, Dongxian (董賢); when Emperor Ai woke up later, he carefully cut off his sleeve, so as not to awake Dongxian, who had fallen asleep on top of it. Scholar Pan Guangdan (潘光旦) came to the conclusion that many emperors in the Han dynasty had one or more male sex partners. However, except in unusual cases, such as Emperor Ai, the men named for their homosexual relationships in the official histories appear to have had active heterosexual lives as well.

With the rise of the Tang dynasty, China became increasingly influenced by the sexual mores of foreigners from Western and Central Asia, and female companions began to replace male companions in terms of power and familial standings. The following Song dynasty was the last dynasty to include a chapter on male companions of the emperors in official documents. During these dynasties, the general attitude toward homosexuality was still tolerant, but male lovers started to be seen as less legitimate compared to wives and men are usually expected to get married and continue the family line.

During the Ming Dynasty, it is said that the Zhengde Emperor had a homosexual relationship with a Muslim leader named Sayyid Husain. In later Ming Dynasty, homosexuality began to be referred to as the &quot;southern custom&quot; due to the fact that Fujian was the site of a unique system of male marriages, attested to by the scholar-bureaucrat Shen Defu and the writer Li Yu, and mythologized by in the folk tale, The Leveret Spirit.

The Qing dynasty instituted the first law against consensual, non-monetized homosexuality in China. However, the punishment designated, which included a month in prison and 100 heavy blows, was actually the lightest punishment which existed in the Qing legal system. Homosexuality started to become eliminated in China by the Self-Strengthening Movement, when homophobia was imported to China along with Western science and philosophy.

=== Japan ===
Homosexuality in Japan, variously known as &quot;shudo&quot; or &quot;nanshoku&quot;, has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the Buddhist monastic life and the samurai tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of painting and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships. 

=== Siam ===
Similarly, in Thailand, &quot;kathoey&quot;, or &quot;ladyboys,&quot; have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While &quot;kathoey&quot; may encompass simple effeminacy or transvestism, it most commonly is treated in Thai culture as a third gender. They are generally accepted by society. 

==Europe ==
=== Antiquity ===
The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and mythographic materials) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from ancient Greece.

The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or freedman) adult male and a free-born adolescent, was valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of population control, though occasionally blamed for causing societal disorder. Plato praised its benefits in his early writings but in his late works proposed its prohibition. In the &quot;Symposium&quot; (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with democracy, and its suppression with despotism, saying that homosexuality &quot;is shameful to barbarians because of their despotic governments, just as philosophy and athletics are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce&quot;.

Aristotle, in his &quot;Politics&quot;, dismissed Plato&#x27;s ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the Celts accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the Cretans used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).

Little is known of female homosexuality in antiquity. Sappho, born on the island of Lesbos, was included by later classical Greek people in the canonical list of nine lyric poets. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (&quot;sapphic&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot;) came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century. Sappho&#x27;s poetry centers on passion and love for various personages and both genders. The narrators of many of her poems speak of infatuations and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various women, but descriptions of physical acts between women are few and subject to debate. 

In ancient Rome, the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous. However, after the transition to Christianity, by 390 A.D., Emperor Theodosius I made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: &quot;All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man&#x27;s body, acting the part of a woman&#x27;s to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&quot; In 558, toward the end of his reign, Justinian expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the &quot;wrath of God&quot;. Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on brothels of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of Anastasius I in 518.

=== The Middle Ages ===

Through the medieval period in Europe, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as Edward II, Richard the Lionheart, Philip II Augustus, and William Rufus were engaged in same-sex relationships.

Also during the medieval period, there were legal arrangements called adelphopoiesis (&quot;brother-making&quot;) in the Eastern Mediterranean or &quot;affrèrement&quot; (&quot;embrotherment&quot;) in France that allowed two men to share living quarters and pool their resources, sharing &quot;one bread, one wine, one purse.&quot; Historians such as John Boswell and Allan A. Tulchin have argued that these arrangements amounted to an early form of same-sex marriage. This interpretation of these arrangements remains controversial.

=== The Renaissance ===
During the Renaissance, wealthy cities in northern Italy—Florence and Venice in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along with the classical pattern of Greece and Rome. But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the Officers of the Night, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population. Many of the prominent artists who defined the Renaissance such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci are believed to have had relationships with men. The decline of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk Girolamo Savonarola.
In England, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; centered around an enigmatic and deceptive character who is also at one point described as &quot;a gelding or a mare&quot;, suggesting that the narrator thought the Pardoner to be either a eunuch (&quot;gelding&quot;) or a homosexual.

=== Modernity ===
==== Early Modernity ====
The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as King James I and the Duke of Buckingham, served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: &quot;The world is chang&#x27;d I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov&#x27;d Ganimede&quot; 

The anonymous &quot;Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson&quot; was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel.

The 1749 edition of John Cleland&#x27;s popular novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition. Also in 1749, the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English, &quot;Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified&quot;, written by Thomas Cannon, was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage: &quot;Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts.&quot; Around 1785 Jeremy Bentham wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978. Executions for sodomy continued in the Netherlands until 1803 and in England until 1835.

==== Late Modernity ====
Between 1864 and 1880 Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled &quot;Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.&quot; In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws. &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; by Havelock Ellis, published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement. Although medical texts like these (written partly in Latin to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s Scientific Humanitarian Committee, which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against anti-sodomy laws in Germany, as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds. Beginning in 1894 with &quot;Homogenic Love&quot;, Socialist activist and poet Edward Carpenter wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and &quot;came out&quot; in 1916 in his book &quot;My Days and Dreams&quot;. In 1900, Elisar von Kupffer published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, &quot;Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur&quot;. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one. Sigmund Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called &quot;bisexuality&quot; is the normal human condition thwarted by society.

These developments suffered several setbacks, both coincidental and deliberate. For example, in 1895, famed playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of &quot;gross indecency&quot; in the United Kingdom, and lurid details from the trials (especially those involving young male sex workers) led to increased scrutiny of all facets of relationships between men. The most destructive backlash occurred when the Third Reich specifically targeted LGBT people in the Holocaust. 

==Middle East==
There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa&#x27;ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad al-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young woman, to maintain their social norms and morals.

Among modern Middle Eastern countries, same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during his 2007 speech at Columbia University, asserted that there were no gay people in Iran. Gay people may live in Iran, however they are forced to keep their sexuality veiled from the society, funded and encouraged by government legislation and traditional norms.

===Mesopotamia===
Some ancient religious Assyrian texts may have contained prayers for divine blessings on homosexual relationships, though the same source acknowledges that homosexuality was regarded as reprehensible, and no less than criminal. Freely pictured art of anal intercourse, practiced as part of a religious ritual, dated from the 3rd millennium BC and onwards. Homosexual relationships with royal attendants, between soldiers, and those where a social better was submissive or penetrated were treated as rape or seen as bad omens, and punishments were applied.

==South Asia==
South Asia has a recorded and verifiable history of homosexuality going back to at least 1200 BC. Hindu medical texts written in India from this period document homosexual acts and attempt to explain the cause in a neutral/scientific manner. Numerous artworks and literary works from this period also describe homosexuality. The Pali Cannon, written in Sri Lanka between 600 BC and 100 BC, states that sexual relations, whether of homosexual or of heterosexual nature, is forbidden in the monastic code, and states that any acts of soft homosexual sex (such as masturbation and interfemural sex) does not entail a punishment but must be confessed to the monastery. These codes apply to monks only and not to the general population. The Kama Sutra written in India around 200 AD also described numerous homosexual sex acts positively.

The &quot;Laws of Manu&quot;, the foundational work of Hindu law, mentions a &quot;third sex&quot;, members of which may engage in nontraditional gender expression and homosexual activities. The Kama Sutra, written in the 4th century, describes techniques by which homosexuals perform fellatio. Further, such homosexual men were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: &quot;There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached to one another and with complete faith in one another, who get married together.&quot; (KS 2.9.36).

==South Pacific==
In many societies of Melanesia, especially in Papua New Guinea, same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The Etoro and Marind-anim for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would &quot;inseminate&quot; him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries.

===Egypt===

Homosexuality in ancient Egypt is a passionately disputed subject within Egyptology: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptian society fostered about homosexuality. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 2494–2345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships. Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, even possibly conjoined twins. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.

It remains unclear what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexually orientated stories never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.

===Uganda===

In the 19th century Mwanga II (1868–1903) the Kabaka of Buganda regularly had sex with his male page.

== Post–World War II ==
=== The Western world ===
After World War II, the history of homosexuality in Western societies progressed on very similar and often intertwined paths.

In 1948, American biologist Alfred Kinsey published &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;, popularly known as the Kinsey Reports. In 1957, the UK government commissioned the Wolfenden report to review the country&#x27;s anti-sodomy laws; the final report advised decriminalizing consensual homosexual conduct, though the laws were not actually changed for another ten years.

Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the United Kingdom. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association.

==== LGBT rights movements ====

During the Sexual Revolution, the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.

The Stonewall riots were a series of violent conflicts between New York City police officers and the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a gay hangout in Greenwich Village. The riot began on Friday, June 27, 1969, during a routine police raid, when trans women and men, gay men, lesbians, street queens, and other street people fought back in the spirit of the civil rights movements of the era. This riot ended on the morning of 28 June, but smaller demonstrations occurred in the neighborhood throughout the remainder of the week. In the aftermath of the riots, many gay rights organizations formed such as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). A year later the first gay pride march was held to mark the anniversary of the uprising.

== Historiographic considerations ==
In an 1868 letter to Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, the terms &quot;homosexual&quot; and &quot;heterosexual&quot; were coined by Karl-Maria Kertbeny and then published in two pamphlets in 1869. These became the standard terms when used by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; (1886). The term &quot;bisexuality&quot; was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominant sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions.

Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;queer&quot;. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities.

However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like &quot;queer&quot;. Other academics acknowledge that, for example, even in the modern day not all men who have sex with men identify with any of the modern related terms, and that terms for other modern constructed or medicalized identities (such as nationality or disability) are routinely used in anachronistic contexts as mere descriptors or for ease of modern understanding; thus they have no qualms doing the same for sexual orientation. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above.

=== Ancient Greece ===

Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was.

Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex pederastic relationships, which come from Ancient Greece. Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate (though there were exceptions, among whom Alexander the Great); he would be the &quot;erastes&quot; (lover) to a young &quot;eromenos&quot; (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover&#x27;s theory suggests that questioned in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge.

=== Ancient Rome ===

The &quot;conquest mentality&quot; of the ancient Romans shaped Roman homosexual practices. In the Roman Republic, a citizen&#x27;s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile. As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have same-sex relations, without a perceived loss of his masculinity or social standing. Sex between male citizens of equal status, including soldiers, was disparaged, and in some circumstances penalized harshly. The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the &quot;Lex Scantinia&quot; imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime &quot;(stuprum)&quot; against a freeborn male minor. Male slaves, prostitutes, and entertainers or others considered &quot;infames&quot; (of no social standing) were acceptable sex partners for the dominant male citizen to penetrate.

&quot;Homosexual&quot; and &quot;heterosexual&quot; were thus not categories of Roman sexuality, and no words exist in Latin that would precisely translate these concepts. A male citizen who willingly performed oral sex or received anal sex was disparaged. In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of effeminacy and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at &quot;democratic&quot; politicians &quot;(populares)&quot; such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Until the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against men who were presumably &quot;homosexual&quot; in the modern sense.

<doc id="333618" wikidata="Q561901" url="?curid=333618" title="Gaius Cestius Gallus (governor of Syria)">
<text>Gaius Cestius Gallus (d. 67 AD) was a Roman senator and general who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul for the second &quot;nundinium&quot; of the year 42 as the colleague of Gaius Caecina Largus. Gallus was the son of Gaius Cestius Gallus, ordinary consul in 35.

==Governor of Syria==
Gallus was proconsul of Syria from 63 to 65. He marched into Judea with a force of over 30,000 men in September 66 in an attempt to restore order at the outset of the First Jewish-Roman War. As assembled at Antioch, Gallus&#x27; army comprised &quot;Legio XII Fulminata&quot;, detachments from the three other legions based in Syria, six cohorts of auxiliary infantry, and four alae of cavalry. These regular troops were supported by 14,000 allies provided by Agrippa II and other client rulers.

==Jewish Revolt==
With his force reduced by detachments sent to occupy Galilee and the Judean coast, Gallus turned inland to subdue Jerusalem. After suffering losses amongst his baggage train and rearguard, Gallus reached Mount Scopus and penetrated the outer city, but was apparently unable to take the Temple Mount. After a siege of nine days, Gallus decided to fall back to the coast. His decision appears to have been based on the loss of siege equipment by ambush and the threatened cutting of his supply lines as the October rains began.

The war-like faction in Jerusalem, under Shimon bar Giora, rose up against the Roman contingent, pursuing them as far as Antipatris, via Beit Horon.

Josephus initially estimated the number of Roman losses at 515, but in the ensuing rout, the dead among the Imperial Roman army numbered 5300 infantrymen and 380 cavalrymen. This incident befell the Roman army in the lunar month of Heshvan, during the 12th year of the reign of Nero, and marked the beginning of the war with Rome.

==Death==
Soon after his return to Syria, and before the spring of 67, Gallus died. According to Titus Flavius Josephus the legate was broken by shame at a major and unexpected Roman defeat. Gallus was succeeded in the governorship of Syria by Licinius Mucianus. Emperor Nero appointed the future Emperor Vespasian as commander of the Roman forces assembled in the province to crush the rebellion in Judea.

<text>The University of Toronto Scarborough (abbreviated as U of T Scarborough or UTSC) is a satellite campus of the University of Toronto located in Scarborough district, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The campus is set upon suburban parkland next to Highland Creek. It was established in 1964 as Scarborough College, a constituent college of the Faculty of Arts and Science. The college expanded following its designation as an autonomic division of the university in 1972 and gradually became a more independent institution. It ranks last in enrolment size among the three University of Toronto campuses, the other two being the St. George campus in Downtown Toronto and the University of Toronto Mississauga.

Academics of the campus are centred on a variety of undergraduate studies in the disciplines of management, arts and sciences, whilst also hosting limited postgraduate research programs. Its neuroscience program was the first to be offered in the nation. The campus is noted for being the university&#x27;s sole provider of cooperative education programs, as well as the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Through affiliation with the adjacent Centennial Science and Technology Centre of Centennial College, it also offers enrolment in joint programs.

The campus has traditionally held the annual F. B. Watts Memorial Lectures, which has hosted internationally renowned scholars since 1970. Its nuclear magnetic resonance laboratory was the first of its kind in Canada, allowing the campus to conduct influential research in the environmental sciences. The original building of the campus was internationally acclaimed for its architectural design. The Dan Lang Field, home to the baseball team of the Toronto Varsity Blues, is also situated at the campus.

==History==
The land along the valley of the Highland Creek was purchased in 1911 by Toronto-based businessman Miller Lash, who developed the site into his summer estate with a mansion, today known as the Miller Lash House. The mansion included 17 rooms, a barn, a coach house, and three houses for his staff to dwell. Over the following years, over 100 acres of the estate was also used as farmland. Following the death of Miller Lash in 1941, the estate was acquired by E. L. McLean, an insurance broker, in 1944 for $59,000. He made new additions to the estate, including a swimming pool and change room, and a retaining wall made in stone.

About of property was later purchased from McLean, just before his death, by the University of Toronto for about $650,000 in 1963, as part of the university&#x27;s regional expansion. The groundskeeper of the land would continue to reside in the Highland Creek valley for the next 29 years. McLean&#x27;s additions to the Miller Lash House, which would eventually become the residence of the campus&#x27;s principal, were modernized and of surrounding land north of the estate were also acquired. The University of Toronto established the Scarborough College as part of the institution&#x27;s collegiate university system and declared the campus a branch of the Faculty of Arts and Science. D. C. Williams was appointed as the principal of Scarborough College and the planned Erindale College, as well as vice-president of the university. The college&#x27;s faculty, consisting of 16 members, was also established and headquartered at the main campus in Downtown Toronto. First classes were held at Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute and Old Biology Building at the St. George campus. Designed by John Andrews, the first building of the campus began construction the following year. Due to delays in construction after a strike among workers, the Scarborough College opened in temporary classes at the main campus to 191 full-time students in 1965. The first building was completed in time for the following academic year.

The college included a television production studio. This was for a unique video lecturing system the college was initially planned to have, that relies on the use of closed-circuit television for teaching purposes. The system grabbed international media attention, and was complimented in the 1967 edition of &quot;Time&quot;. However, the video lecturing system was abandoned after it was condemned for the lack of communicability of students with instructors. In 1972, the campus was reorganized as a separately governed division of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Science, developing its own curriculum. In 1973, it became the first post-secondary institution to adopt a course credit system in Ontario and the first cooperative education program was established. The campus adopted its present official name in 2006 after being renamed University of Toronto Scarborough Campus in 1983 and University of Toronto at Scarborough in 1996. The initials UTSC comes from the former name and continue to be used by the university to distinguish the campus from University of Toronto Schools (UTS).

==Grounds==
===Campus===
For much of its existence, the University of Toronto Scarborough was described as a &quot;mid-sized university campus&quot;. It sits on of land, forming the west side of the Highland Creek neighbourhood. It is bounded entirely by Morningside Avenue to the west. Its eastern, northern and southern borders are not definite, however; the campus grounds extend north slightly south of Highway 401 and south slightly north of Old Kingston Road. Its eastern boundary is Military Trail while south of Ellesmere Road and slightly further east while north of Ellesmere Road. Unlike the university&#x27;s downtown campus, the University of Toronto Scarborough is located in a suburban area, consisting of residential houses along its eastern side and urban forestry on its southern and western side. The neighbourhood&#x27;s namesake river runs through the southern portion of the grounds and its valley consists of pedestrian trails that link the campus to nearby parks and neighbourhoods.

Transit bus service by the Toronto Transit Commission, GO Transit, and Durham Region Transit connect the campus to nearby transportation hubs.

===Architecture===

The Andrews Building, the first completed building of the campus named after its designer, John Andrews, was built in a brutalist architectural style and completed in 1964. Andrews objected to the term &quot;brutalist,&quot; since the architecture was built with human needs and logic in mind, aiming to create a connected space that limited outdoor exposure in the winter. The interiors were made to mimic streets of a city, with wide hallways and balconies on upper floors. The building is divided into two wings, known as the Science Wing and the Humanities Wing. The Meeting Place, a large atrium at the center of both wings, is often used to hold events. The design of the Andrews Building, along with its unique closed-circuit television teaching system, were targets of international acclaim during the decade.

The 1970s and onward saw new buildings being designed in a modernist style. The Recreational Wing, now known as the Bladen Wing (named after Vincent Bladen, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science) was completed in 1972. The Recreation Wing (R-Wing) housed the University of Toronto Scarborough Library, then known as the Vincent W. Bladen Library. The N&#x27;Sheemaehn Child Care Centre, one of the university&#x27;s non-profit child day care facilities, opened in 1990. An underground corridor completed in 1995, known as the Hall of Excellence, connects the R-Wing (Bladen Wing) and the H-Wing (Humanities Wing).

Double cohort brought challenges to the teaching, study and residence spaces at the campus due to increase in first-year enrollment. In response, the Academic Research Centre (ARC) and Joan Foley Hall were constructed. The ARC was built in 2003 as an extension of the Bladen Building with a copper finish. It allowed for the relocation and expansion of the library to its present state and introduced the campus&#x27;s first 300-seat lecture theatre, which has since held the Watts Lecture series, after formerly being held in the Meeting Place. The Doris McCarthy Gallery, also found in the ARC, exhibits works by local artist and campus alumni, Doris McCarthy. The Student Centre was opened in 2004 through a project that was initiated and funded by students. Constructed using 18 tonnes of recycled steel from a demolished gallery at the Royal Ontario Museum, the three-storey Student Centre earned a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification as well as a Green Design Award from the City of Toronto. The Social Sciences Building, home of the Department of Social Sciences, also opened in 2004 as the Management Wing but took its present name after the completion of the Instructional Centre in 2011, which became the new home of the Department of Management, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and offices of cooperative education programs. Brick and limestone were used to create the Arts and Administration Building, completed in 2005, which holds the principal&#x27;s office. The Science Research Building, where post-graduate research facilities and a lecture hall are located, is an extension of the Science Wing that was completed in 2008.

===Expansion===
Since 2009, the university has undertaken a proposal to substantially expand the campus north of Ellesmere Road, starting with the construction of the Instructional Centre, funded by Canada&#x27;s Economic Action Plan, completed in 2011. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre (built 2014) was one of the main venues of the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre brought pool facility to campus and significantly expanded the size of the gym. The Parapan American Games also brought an addition of seven accessible tennis courts to the Highland Creek valley. The Environmental Science and Chemistry Building, completed in summer 2015, was the third building to open in the north grounds. The most recent addition to campus architecture is Highland Hall, built on the footprint of the old gym and athletic centre. Highland Hall houses the Registrar&#x27;s Office, Admissions &amp; Recruitment, and an Event Centre. Plans for expansion in the near future include a second Instructional Centre, a new student residence, and an indigenous house.

In 2022, the Ontario government announced that University of Toronto Scarborough would provide medical training as well. The campus will receive 30 undergraduate seats and 45 postgraduate positions. The medical facility will train approximately 300 doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and physical therapists in total each year.

==Student life==
===Student centre===

The Student Centre is a three-story building, where the office of the Scarborough Campus Students&#x27; Union (SCSU), office of Student Affairs of the University of Toronto Scarborough, as well as other offices of student clubs and organizations, are located. It also contains a television lounge, food court, health and wellness centre, and multifaith prayer room. The Rex&#x27;s Den is a pub and dine-in restaurant located in the first floor of the Student Centre. It was formerly operated as &quot;The Bluffs&quot;, which opened subsequently after the opening of the Student Centre but re-opened with its present name and improved service in 2009.

===Media and Greek life===
Student media on the campus include Radio Forward (formerly Fusion Radio), the campus&#x27;s student-run internet radio station (predated by CSCR 90.5 Cable FM), and &quot;The Underground&quot;, the campus&#x27;s official student news outlet. The campus also receives distributions of &quot;The Varsity&quot;.

Greek life at University of Toronto Scarborough includes two sororities: Chi Sigma Xi multicultural sorority and Delta Alpha Theta - Gamma chapter. In addition to this there is also one fraternity Xi Alpha Pi multicultural fraternity. None of these organizations has a house. As per their policy, the University of Toronto does not officially recognize fraternities or sororities.

===Residences===
Student residence is located primarily in the southernmost part of the campus, consisting mostly of townhouse-style homes and the Student Centre. The first residence area, the Student Village, which was able to accommodate 250 students, was opened in 1973 after pressure from traveling students. The townhouses are split into different halls, each bearing a different type of wood&#x27;s name, in alphabetical order. These &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; houses, the ones originally part of the Student Village, include Aspen, Birch, Cedar, Dogwood, and Elm hall. The next &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; halls erected include Fir, Grey Pine, Hickory, and Ironwood hall. &#x27;Phase 3&#x27; are the townhouses located north of the main campus, near the Science Research building, include Juniper, Koa, Larch, and Maple Hall. Over 600 people can live in the townhouses. The townhouses feature shared common areas, kitchens, and bathrooms for students.

The four-story-high Joan Foley Hall, opened in 2003, is the first apartment-style residence complex on campus, named after the campus&#x27;s first female principal. It accommodates 230 people. It is a suite-style dorm with shared common areas, kitchens, and bathrooms per unit. The building is equipped with an elevator. It is located in the Southern Residence area.

The Student Residence Centre, a white building located next to Joan Foley Hall, is where the administration for the housing is run, and acts as a common area for all residence students. It handles all mail for students, and has some supplies such as garbage bags and light bulbs available for students to use.

All housing has both shared and single bedrooms available, as well as housing periods dependent upon semester. Student housing has a &#x27;first-year guarantee&#x27; where first-years who apply before a certain deadline are guaranteed to find housing.

<doc id="333620" wikidata="Q712663" url="?curid=333620" title="Richard Li">
<text>Richard Li Tzar-kai is a Hong Kong businessman and philanthropist. The founder and chairman of the private investment group Pacific Century Group (PCG), 
Li started his career in the 1990s with the founding of STAR TV, a pan-Asian television network. After founding PCG in 1993, he went on to establish PCCW and HKT Trust. 

In 2010, PCG acquired the asset management business of AIG Investments and renamed it to PineBridge Investments. In 2013, PCG founded FWD Group. Richard Li currently serves as chairman of PCG, PCCW Ltd. and HKT Limited. He is also on the boards of companies including Pinebridge Investments. &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his net worth in 2020 at $4.5 billion, ranking him 20th on its list of the richest businesspeople in Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1966 in Hong Kong, Richard Li Tzar-kai is the son of businessman Li Ka-shing. Li and his older brother Victor spent their childhoods in Hong Kong, where Li attended St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College. He left Hong Kong at age thirteen to be educated at Menlo School in Atherton, California. In high school, he worked at McDonald&#x27;s and as a caddy at the local golf course. He studied computer engineering at Stanford University until 1987. Citing personal reasons, he withdrew from university after three years.

==Career==
===Founding PCG===
For the first three years of his career, Li managed funds at an investment bank in Toronto, Canada, acquiring Canadian citizenship in the 1980s. In 1990 he began working in the fund-management department at Hutchison Whampoa in Hong Kong. At Hutchison Whampoa, he was an executive director from 1992 until 1993 and deputy chairman from 1993 until 2000. 

In 1990, Li began building his own company, STAR TV, a pan-Asian satellite-television network that streamed American television. According to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, the service &quot;triggered a vast cultural shift, injecting a massive dose of Western popular entertainment into... more than 50 countries [by 2005].&quot; STAR TV proved lucrative, and in 1993 and 1995 Li sold the network to Rupert Murdoch for a total of USD$950.5 million.

Using the funds raised from the sale of STAR TV, in 1993 Li founded Pacific Century Group (PCG), an Asia-based investment group with Li serving as CEO and chairman. Li subsequently oversaw PCG&#x27;s investments in real estate, financial services, technology, and media &amp; telecommunications. 

He was an executive director at Hongkong Electric Holdings from 1993 until 2000, and chairman of Singapore-based Pacific Century Regional Developments Limited starting in 1994, a role he still held in 2020.

===PCCW and HKT Trust===
In 1996, Li established Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW). Serving as the company&#x27;s chairman starting in 1999, he remained chairman when the company changed its name to PCCW Ltd. in 2002. 

In his early financial dealings with PCCW, his Canadian citizenship allowed him to bid on companies such as Air Canada and Bell Canada Enterprises without running afoul of restrictions on foreign ownership. PCCW acquired Cable &amp; Wireless HKT for US$38 billion in 2000, in &quot;what was then Asia&#x27;s largest corporate takeover.&quot; The acquisition made PCCW the largest fixed-lined network and wireless operator in Hong Kong. Li joined the board of the Bank of East Asia in 2001, retaining the role until 2017. 

In 2004, he created the property company PCPD, or Pacific Century Premium Developments, as a spinoff from PCCW, and was chairman of PCPD from 2004 until 2019.
As chairman of both PCCW and PCCW&#x27;s executive committee, in 2011 Li was involved in the spinoff and initial public offering of PCCW&#x27;s telecommunications assets on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. With the spinoff named HKT Trust, the listing plan was approved by the exchange in June 2011 and PCCW shareholders on 12 October 2011, allowing for the creation of Hong Kong&#x27;s first publicly traded business trust. The IPO ultimately raised around $1.2 billion. with PCCW maintaining a majority interest in both HKT Trust and HKT Limited. In November 2011, Li became chairman of HKT Trust, HKT Limited, and HKT&#x27;s executive committee.

With Li as chairman, in December 2013 HKT agreed to acquire CSL New World Mobility, a subsidiary of Telstra, for HK$18.8 billion. The transaction was completed in early 2014. In March 2015, PCCW Media acquired the mobile video provider Vuclip, and launched the streaming service Viu. Viu was rolled out to 24 markets globally over the next two years, and, by 2017, Viu, Vuclip, and the music streaming service MOOV had been bundled into the company PCCW OTT. That August, PCCW OT secured new investors including Hony Capital, Foxconn Ventures and Temasek. Li was 15th in the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of Hong Kong&#x27;s 50 richest people for 2017. The same publication named him 385th in the list of the world&#x27;s billionaires, with an estimated fortune of $4.3 billion.

===PineBridge and FWD Group===

In September 2009, Li oversaw PCG&#x27;s acquisition of AIG Investments for around $500 million, renaming the asset management company PineBridge Investments.

Re-entering the insurance business, in March 2013, Li&#x27;s PCG acquired the Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand insurance business of ING Groep N.V. for $2.1 billion, renaming it FWD Group. With backing by Swiss Re, Li expanded FWD Group through acquisitions, appointing Ronald Arculli as FWD chairman in October 2013. In 2015, Li then appointed former Canadian foreign affairs minister John Baird as a non-executive director to both FWD and PineBridge. By 2016, Li had overseen FWD&#x27;s expansion into Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan.

===Recent developments===
After Li purchased the Hanazono resort in Niseko, Hokkaido in 2007 through his company Pacific Century Premium Developments, development was delayed by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster. 

By 2018, he had invested a total of US$930 million in the project, with an onsen, apartments, and two hotels including a Park Hyatt nearing completion by late 2019. 

In 2018, Li was quoted stating that his insurance businesses took up &quot;70% to 80% of his time,&quot; with Li focused on expanding FWD in the Southeast Asian markets. In 2019, FWD had around $30 billion in assets under management. Also in 2019, Li&#x27;s HKT announced it was establishing one of the first licensed virtual banks in Hong Kong, and in 2020 launched 5G wireless services. Under Li, the insurance group bolttech was launched in early 2020.

He continued to chair Pacific Century Group in 2020, and remained chairman of PCCW Ltd. and HKT Limited. Also on the boards of companies such as PineBridge, Li oversees PCCW subsidiaries such as PCCW Media and the IT and business process outsourcing company PCCW Solutions. As of December 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion, ranking him 20th on its list of the richest businesspeople in Hong Kong, and 401st on its list of the world&#x27;s billionaires.

==Boards and public positions==
Li is currently a member of the Global Information Infrastructure Commission, the United Nations, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies&#x27; International Councillors Group in Washington DC. He was previously the Governor of the World Economic Forum for Information Technologies and Telecommunications, as well as a representative of the Hong Kong government at the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) from 2009 to 2014. He was praised by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Rita Lau, for &quot;helping [to] raise Hong Kong&#x27;s profile in this important regional business forum&quot;.

Li served as a council member of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, but his association with the university has since ended. He is a full member of the Hong Kong Computer Society.

==Philanthropy==

In 2006, Li donated CA$1 million to the Canadian National Arts Centre Foundation in Ottawa, which led to the establishment of the Annual Richard Li Young Artist Chair, putting young musicians each year under the mentorship of musical maestros.

Through PCCW, Li has overseen a number of relief efforts and charity programs. During the 2002–03 SARS outbreak, PCCW provided telecommunication services to patients, medical staff, and fundraisers. Li also established a story time program for children kept home to prevent infection, and call centre support for charity fundraisers and community activists. Under Li, PCCW also donated $1 million to the Business Community Relief Fund for Victims of SARS, with employees volunteering man-hours as well. Later in 2007, PCCW volunteers participated in the District Elderly Campaign, which delivers gift packages to the elderly.

After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Li&#x27;s PCG donated surgical masks to health care workers and NGOs in Hong Kong in February 2020.

==Recognition==
Li was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Association of Asia in November 2011. He has also been presented with a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal for &quot;outstanding business and charitable contributions to Canada.&quot;

==Personal life==
Li&#x27;s girlfriend Isabella Leong, a former Hong Kong singer, gave birth to their son Ethan in April 2008, followed by twin sons in June 2010. Leong announced in March 2011 that the couple had amicably ended their relationship and that both would be caring for the children. Li is a licensed pilot in the United States and Canada, as well as a licensed divemaster. In 2016, Li bought his own top-level domain (.richardli) for $250,000.

<text>Bus rapid transit (BRT), also referred to as a busway or transitway, is a trolleybus, electric bus and public transport bus service system designed to have much more capacity, reliability, and other quality features than a conventional bus system. Typically, a BRT system includes roadways that are dedicated to buses, and gives priority to buses at intersections where buses may interact with other traffic; alongside design features to reduce delays caused by passengers boarding or leaving buses, or paying fares. BRT aims to combine the capacity and speed of a light rail transit (LRT) or mass rapid transit (MRT) system with the flexibility, lower cost and simplicity of a bus system.

The world&#x27;s first BRT system was the Runcorn Busway in Runcorn New Town, England, which entered service in 1971. , a total of 166 cities in six continents have implemented BRT systems, accounting for of BRT lanes and about 32.2 million passengers every day.

The majority of these are in Latin America, where about 19.6 million passengers ride daily, and which has the most cities with BRT systems, with 54, led by Brazil with 21 cities. The Latin American countries with the most daily ridership are Brazil (10.7 million), Colombia (3.0 million), and Mexico (2.5 million).

In the other regions, China (4.3 million) and Iran (2.1 million) stand out. Currently, TransJakarta is the largest BRT network in the world, with about of corridors connecting the Indonesian capital city.

== Terminology ==
Bus rapid transit is a mode of mass rapid transit (MRT) and describes a high-capacity urban public-transit system with its own right of way, vehicles at short headways, platform-level boarding, and preticketing.

The expression &quot;BRT&quot; is mainly used in the Americas and China; in India, it is called &quot;BRTS&quot; (BRT System); in Europe it is often called a &quot;busway&quot; or a &quot;BHLS&quot; (stands for &quot;Bus with a High Level of Service&quot;). The term transitway was originated in 1981 with the opening of the OC Transpo transitway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Critics have charged that the term &quot;bus rapid transit&quot; has sometimes been misapplied to systems that lack most or all the essential features which differentiate it from conventional bus services. The term &quot;bus rapid transit creep&quot; has been used to describe severely degraded levels of bus service which fall far short of the BRT Standard promoted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and other organizations.

== Reasons for use ==
Compared to other common transit modes such as light rail transit (LRT), bus rapid transit (BRT) service is attractive to transit authorities because it does not cost as much to establish and operate: no track needs to be laid, bus drivers typically require less training and less pay than rail operators, and bus maintenance is less complex than rail maintenance.

Moreover, buses are more flexible than rail vehicles, because a bus route can be altered, either temporarily or permanently, to meet changing demand or contend with adverse road conditions with comparatively little investment of resources.

== History ==

The first use of a protected busway was the East Side Trolley Tunnel in Providence, Rhode Island. It was converted from trolley to bus use in 1948. However, the first BRT system in the world was the Runcorn Busway in Runcorn, England. First conceived in the Runcorn New Town Masterplan in 1966, it opened for services in October 1971 and all were operational by 1980. The central station is at Runcorn Shopping City where buses arrive on dedicated raised busways to two enclosed stations. Arthur Ling, Runcorn Development Corporation&#x27;s Master Planner, said that he had invented the concept while sketching on the back of an envelope. The town was designed around the transport system, with most residents no more than five minutes walking distance, or , from the Busway.
The second BRT system in the world was the Rede Integrada de Transporte (RIT, &quot;integrated transportation network&quot;), implemented in Curitiba, Brazil, in 1974. The Rede Integrada de Transporte was inspired by the previous transport system of the National Urban Transport Company of Peru (In Spanish: ENATRU), which only had quick access on Lima downtown, but it would not be considered BRT itself. Many of the elements that have become associated with BRT were innovations first suggested by Carlos Ceneviva, within the team of Curitiba Mayor Jaime Lerner. Initially just dedicated bus lanes in the center of major arterial roads, in 1980 the Curitiba system added a feeder bus network and inter-zone connections, and in 1992 introduced off-board fare collection, enclosed stations, and platform-level boarding. Other systems made further innovations, including platooning (three buses entering and leaving bus stops and traffic signals at once) in Porto Alegre, and passing lanes and express service in São Paulo.

In the United States, BRT began in 1977, with Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Busway, operating on of exclusive lanes. Its success led to the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway in 1983, a fuller BRT deployment including a dedicated busway of , traffic signal preemption, and peak service headway as low as two minutes. After the opening of the West Busway, in length in 2000, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Busway system is today over 18.5 miles long.

The OC Transpo BRT system in Ottawa, Canada, was introduced in 1983. The first element of its BRT system was dedicated bus lanes through the city centre, with platformed stops. The introduction of exclusive separate busways (termed &#x27;Transitway&#x27;) occurred in 1983. By 1996, all of the originally envisioned 31 km Transitway system was in operation; further expansions were opened in 2009, 2011, and 2014. As of 2019, the central part of the Transitway has been converted to light rail transit, due to the downtown section being operated beyond its designed capacity.

In 1995, Quito, Ecuador, opened MetrobusQ its first BRT trolleybuses in Quito, using articulated trolleybuses.

The TransMilenio in Bogotá, Colombia, opening in 2000, was the first BRT system to combine the best elements of Curitiba&#x27;s BRT with other BRT advances, and achieved the highest capacity and highest speed BRT system in the world.

In January 2004 the first BRT in Southeast Asia, TransJakarta, opened in Jakarta, Indonesia. , at , it is the longest BRT system in the world.

Africa&#x27;s first BRT system was opened in Lagos, Nigeria, in March 2008 but is considered a light BRT system by many people. Johannesburg, South Africa, BRT Rea Vaya, was the first true BRT in Africa, in August 2009, carrying 16,000 daily passengers. Rea Vaya and MIO (BRT in Cali, Colombia, opened 2009) were the first two systems to combine full BRT with some services that also operated in mixed traffic, then joined the BRT trunk infrastructure.

In 2017 Marrakesh, Morocco, opened its first BRT Marrakesh trolleybus system (BHNS De Marrakesh) trolleybuses Corridors of 8 km (5.0 mi), of which 3 km (1.9 mi) of overhead wiring for operation as trolleybus.

== Main features ==

BRT systems normally include most of the following features:

=== Dedicated lanes and alignment ===

Bus-only lanes make for faster travel and ensure that buses are not delayed by mixed traffic congestion. A median alignment bus-only keeps buses away from busy curb-side side conflicts, where cars and trucks are parking, standing and turning. Separate rights of way may be used such as the completely elevated Xiamen BRT. Transit malls or &#x27;bus streets&#x27; may also be created in city centers.

=== Off-board fare collection ===
Fare prepayment at the station, instead of on board the bus, eliminates the delay caused by passengers paying on board. Fare machines at stations also allow riders to purchase multi-ride stored-value cards and have multiple payment options. Prepayment also allows riders to board at all doors, further speeding up stops.

=== Bus priority, turning and standing restrictions ===
Prohibiting turns for traffic across the bus lane significantly reduces delays to the buses. Bus priority will often be provided at signalized intersections to reduce delays by extending the green phase or reducing the red phase in the required direction compared to the normal sequence. Prohibiting turns may be the most important measure for moving buses through intersections.

=== Platform-level boarding ===

The station platforms for BRT systems should be level with the bus floor for quick and easy boarding, making it fully accessible for wheelchairs, disabled passengers and baby strollers, with minimal delays.

High-level platforms for high-floored buses makes it difficult to have stops outside dedicated platforms, or to have conventional buses stop at high-level platforms, so these BRT stops are distinct from street-level bus stops. Similar to rail vehicles, there is a risk of a dangerous gap between bus and platform, and is even greater due to the nature of bus operations. Kassel curbs or other methods may be used to ease quick and safe alignment of the BRT vehicle with a platform.

A popular compromise is low-floor buses with a low step at the door, which can allow easy boarding at low-platform stops compatible with other buses. This intermediate design may be used with some low- or medium-capacity BRT systems.

The MIO system in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, pioneered in 2009 the use of dual buses, with doors on the left side of the bus that are located at the height of high-level platforms, and doors on the right side that are located at curb height. These buses can use the main line with its exclusive lanes and high level platforms, located on the center of the street and thus, boarding and leaving passengers on the left side. These buses can exit the main line and use normal lanes that share with other vehicles and stop at regular stations located on sidewalks on the right side of the street.

== Additional features ==
Groups of criteria form the BRT Standard 2016, which is updated by the Technical Committee of the BRT Standard.

=== High capacity vehicles ===
High-capacity vehicles such as articulated or even bi-articulated buses may be used, typically with multiple doors for fast entry and exit. Double-decker buses or guided buses may also be used. Advanced powertrain control may be used for a smoother ride.

=== Quality stations ===

Bottleneck BRT stations typically provide loading areas for simultaneous boarding and alighting of buses through multiple doors coordinated via displays and loudspeakers.

An example of high-quality stations include those used on TransMilenio in Bogotá since December 2000, the MIO in Cali since November 2008, Metrolinea in Bucaramanga since December 2009, Megabús in Pereira since May 2009. This design is also used in Johannesburg&#x27;s Rea Vaya.

The term &quot;station&quot; is more flexibly applied in North America and ranges from enclosed waiting areas (Ottawa and Cleveland) to large open-sided shelters (Los Angeles and San Bernardino).

=== Prominent brand or identity ===
A unique and distinctive identity can contribute to BRT&#x27;s attractiveness as an alternative to driving cars, (such as Viva, Max, TransMilenio, Metropolitano, Metronit, Select) marking stops and stations as well as the buses.

Large cities usually have big bus networks. A map showing all bus lines might be incomprehensible, and cause people to wait for low-frequency buses that may not even be running at the time they are needed. By identifying the main bus lines having high-frequency service, with a special brand and separate maps, it is easier to understand the entire network.

Public transit apps are more convenient than a static map, featuring services like trip planning, live arrival and departure times, up-to-date line schedules, local station maps, service alerts, and advisories that may affect one&#x27;s current trip. Transit and Moovit are examples of apps that are available in many cities around the world. Some operators of bus rapid transit systems have developed their own apps, like Transmilenio. These apps even include all the schedules and live arrival times and stations for buses that feed the BRT, like the SITP (Sistema Integrado de Transporte Público or Public Transit Integrated System) in Bogotá.

=== In tunnels or subterranean structures ===

A special issue arises in the use of buses in metro transit structures. Since the areas where the demand for an exclusive bus right-of-way are apt to be in dense downtown areas where an above-ground structure may be unacceptable on historic, logistic, or environmental grounds, use of BRT in tunnels may not be avoidable.

Since buses are usually powered by internal combustion engines, bus metros raise ventilation issues similar to those of motor vehicle tunnels. Powerful fans typically exchange air through ventilation shafts to the surface; these are usually as remote as possible from occupied areas, to minimize the effects of noise and concentrated pollution.

A straightforward way to reduce air quality problems is to use internal combustion engines with lower emissions. The 2008 Euro V European emission standards set a limit on carbon monoxide from heavy-duty diesel engines of 1.5 g/kWh, one third of the 1992 Euro I standard. As a result, less forced ventilation will be required in tunnels to achieve the same air quality.

Another alternative is to use electric propulsion, which Seattle&#x27;s Metro Bus Tunnel and Boston&#x27;s Silver Line Phase II implemented. In Seattle, dual-mode (electric/diesel electric) buses manufactured by Breda were used until 2004, with the center axle driven by electric motors obtaining power from trolley wires through trolley poles in the subway, and with the rear axle driven by a conventional diesel powertrain on freeways and streets. Boston is using a similar approach, after initially using trolleybuses pending delivery of the dual-mode vehicles that was completed in 2005.

In 2004, Seattle replaced its &quot;Transit Tunnel&quot; fleet with diesel-electric hybrid buses, which operate similarly to hybrid cars outside the tunnel and in a low-noise, low-emissions &quot;hush mode&quot; (in which the diesel engine operates but does not exceed idle speed) when underground. The need to provide electric power in underground environments brings the capital and maintenance costs of such routes closer to those of light rail, and raises the question of building or eventually converting to light rail. In Seattle, the downtown transit tunnel was retrofitted for conversion to a shared hybrid-bus and light-rail facility in preparation for Seattle&#x27;s Central Link Light Rail line, which opened in July 2009. In March 2019, expansion of the light rail in the tunnel moved busses back to surface streets.

Bi-articulated battery electric buses cause no problems in tunnels anymore but provide BRT capacity.

== Performance ==

A BRT system can be measured by a number of factors. The BRT Standard was developed by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) to score BRT corridors, producing a list of rated BRT corridors meeting the minimum definition of BRT. The highest rated systems received a &quot;gold&quot; ranking. The latest edition of the standard was published in 2016.

Other metrics used to evaluate BRT performance include:
* The vehicle headway is the average time interval between vehicles on the same line. Buses can operate at headways of 10 seconds or less, but average headways on TransMilenio at busy intersections are 13 seconds, 14 seconds for the busiest section of the Metrobus (Istanbul), 7 seconds in Belo Horizonte, 6 seconds in Rio de Janeiro.
* Vehicle capacity, which can range from 50 passengers for a conventional bus up to some 300 for a bi-articulated vehicle or 500.
* The effectiveness of the stations to handle passenger demand. High volumes of passengers on vehicles require large bus stations and more boarding areas at busy interchange points. This is the standard bottleneck of BRT (and heavy rail). 
* The effectiveness of the feeder system: can these deliver people to stations at the required speed?
* Local passenger demand. Without enough local demand for travel, the capacity will not be used.

Based on this data, the minimum headway and maximum current vehicle capacities, the theoretical maximum throughput measured in passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD) for a single traffic lane is some 150,000 passengers per hour (250 passengers per vehicle, one vehicle every 6 seconds). In real world conditions BRT Rio (de Janeiro, BRS Presidente Vargas) with 65.000 PPHPD holds the record, TransMilenio Bogotá and Metrobus Istanbul perform 49,000 – 45,000 PPHPD, most other busy systems operating in the 15,000 to 25,000 range.
Research of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) shows a capacity ranking of MRT modes, based on reported performance of 14 light rail systems, 14 heavy rail systems (just 1-track + 3 2-track-systems &quot;highest capacity&quot;) and 56 BRT systems.

The study concludes, that BRT-&quot;capacity on TransMilenio exceeds all but the highest capacity heavy rail systems, and it far exceeds the highest light rail system.&quot;

Performance data of 84 systems show

# 37,700 passengers in peak hour per direction (PPHPD) in the best BRT system
# 36,000 in the best 1-track-heavy rail system
# 13,400 in the best light rail system

More topical are these BRT data

* 45,000 PPHPD in a 1-lane-system using articulated buses (2020 in Istanbul) 
* 320 busses per hour per direction in the corridor Nossa Senhora de Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro for the year 2014 meaning a bus every 11 seconds. 
* 65,400 PPHPD in 600 buses in the corridor Presidente Vargas in Rio de Janeiro for the years 2012 resp. 2014, which means 10 buses per minute or a bus every 6 seconds.

=== Comparison with light rail ===

After the first BRT system opened in 1971, cities were slow to adopt BRT because they believed that the capacity of BRT was limited to about 12,000 passengers per hour traveling in a given direction during peak demand. While this is a capacity rarely needed in the US (12,000 is more typical as a total daily ridership), in the developing world this capacity constraint (or rumor of a capacity constraint) was a significant argument in favor of heavy rail metro investments in some venues.

When TransMilenio opened in 2000, it changed the paradigm by giving buses a passing lane at each station stop and introducing express services within the BRT infrastructure. These innovations increased the maximum achieved capacity of a BRT system to 35,000 passengers per hour. The single-lane roads of Istanbul Metrobus had been frequently blocked by Phileas buses breaking down, causing delays for all the buses in a single direction. After focusing on Mercedes-Benz buses, capacity increased to 45,000 pph. Light rail, by comparison, has reported passenger capacities between 3,500 pph (mainly street running) to 19,000 pph (fully grade-separated).

There are conditions that favor light rail over BRT, but they are fairly narrow. These conditions are a corridor with only one available lane in each direction, more than 16,000 passengers per direction per hour but less than 20,000, and a long block length, because the train cannot block intersections. These conditions are rare, but in that specific instance, light rail might have a minimal operational advantage.

The United States Government Accountability Office (U.S. GAO) summarized in the report &quot;Mass Transit – Bus Rapid Transit Shows Promise&quot;, the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provided funding for the construction of heavy rail and of light rail at that time, but not of BRT. The FTA funding of BRT &quot;rather focuses on obtaining and sharing information on projects being pursued by local transit agencies&quot;. In spite of this different funding the capital costs of BRT systems were lower in many US communities than those of light rail systems and performance often similar. The GAO stated, BRT systems were generally more flexible compared to light rail and faster. &quot;While transit officials noted a public bias toward Light Rail, research has found that riders have no preference for rail over bus when service characteristics are equal.&quot;

===Comparison with heavy rail===
Fjellstrom/Wright distributed a map of the mid-term goal to expand Bogota&#x27;s BRT system, TransMilenio, so that 85% of the city&#x27;s 7 million inhabitants live within 500m distance to a TransMileneo line. Such an expansion program would be unrealistic for a rail-based MRT-system, according to Bogota&#x27;s mayor.

An additional use of BRT is the replacement of heavy rail services, due to infrastructure damage, reduced ridership, or a combination of both where lower maintenance costs are desired while taking advantage of an existing dedicated right of way. One such system in Japan consists of portions of the JR East Kesennuma and Ōfunato Lines, which were catastrophically damaged during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and later repaired as a bus lane over the same right of way, providing improved service with much lower restoration and maintenance costs. Another system set to open in August 2023 is a portion of the JR Kyushu Hitahikosan Line, which was damaged due to torrential rain in 2017. In both cases, ridership had dropped considerably since the lines opened, and the higher capacity of a rail line is no longer needed or cost-effective compared to buses on the same alignments.

=== Comparison with conventional bus services ===

Conventional scheduled bus services use general traffic lanes, which can be slow due to traffic congestion, and the speed of bus services is further reduced by long dwell times. 

In 2013, the New York City authorities noted that buses on 34th Street, which carried 33,000 bus riders a day on local and express routes, traveled at , only slightly faster than walking pace. Even despite the implementation of Select Bus Service (New York City&#x27;s version of a bus rapid transit system), dedicated bus lanes, and traffic cameras on the 34th Street corridor, buses on the corridor were still found to travel at an average of 4.5 mph.

In the 1960s, Reuben Smeed predicted that the average speed of traffic in central London would be without other disincentives such as road pricing, based on the theory that this was the minimum speed that people will tolerate. When the London congestion charge was introduced in 2003, the average traffic speed was indeed which was the highest speed since the 1970s. By way of contrast, typical speeds of BRT systems range from .

== Cost ==
The capital cost of implementing BRT is lower than for light rail: A study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 2000 found that the average capital cost per mile for busways was $13.5 million while light rail average cost was $34.8 million. The total investment varies considerably due to factors such as cost of the roadway, amount of grade separation, station structures and traffic signal systems.

In 2003, a study edited by the German GTZ compared various MRT systems all over the world and concluded ″Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) can provide high-quality, metro-like transit service at a fraction of the cost of other options″.

In 2013, the analysis of a database of nineteen LRT projects, twenty-six HRT projects, and forty-two BRT projects specified &quot;In higher income countries ... an HRT alternative is likely to cost up to 40 times as much as a BRT alternative&quot;. and a surface LRT alternative about 4 times that of a BRT alternative.

Operational cost of running a BRT system is generally lower than light rail, though the exact comparison varies, and labor costs depend heavily on wages, which vary between countries. For the same level of ridership and demand, higher labor costs in the developed world relative to developing countries will tend to encourage developed world transit operators to prefer operate services with larger but less frequent vehicles. This will allow the service to achieve the same capacity while minimizing the number of drivers. This may come as a hidden cost to passengers in lower demand routes who experience significantly lower frequencies and longer waiting times and limit gain of ridership.

In the study done by the U.S. GAO, BRT systems usually had lower cost as well based on &quot;operating cost per vehicle hour&quot;, as on &quot;operating cost per revenue mile&quot;, and on &quot;operating cost per passenger trip&quot;, mainly because of lower vehicle cost and lower infrastructure cost.

An ambitious light rail system runs partly grade separated (e.g. underground), which gives free right-of-way and much faster traffic compared to passing the traffic signals needed in a surface level system. Underground BRT was suggested as early as 1954. As long as most buses still run on diesel, air quality can become a significant concern in tunnels, but the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is an example of using hybrid buses, which switch to overhead electric propulsion while they are underground, eliminating diesel emissions and reducing fuel usage. Alternatives are elevated busways or - more expensive - elevated railways.
== Criticism ==
BRT systems have been widely promoted by non-governmental organizations such as the Shell-funded EMBARQ program, Rockefeller Foundation and Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), whose consultant pool includes the former mayor of Bogota (Colombia), Enrique Peñalosa (former president of ITDP).

Supported by contributions of bus-producing companies such as Volvo, the ITDP not only established a proposed &quot;standard&quot; for BRT system implementation, but developed intensive lobby activities around the world to convince local governments to select BRT systems over rail-based transportation models (subways, light trains, etc.).

=== &quot;Fake&quot; BRT systems (BRT creep) ===

Bus rapid transit creep is a phenomenon commonly defined as a bus rapid transit (BRT) system that fails to meet the requirements to be considered &quot;true BRT&quot;. These systems are often marketed as a fully realized bus rapid transit system, but end up being described as more of an improvement to regular bus service by proponents of the &quot;BRT creep&quot; term. Notably, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) published several guidelines in an attempt to define what constitutes the term of &quot;true BRT&quot;, known as the BRT Standard, in an attempt to avert this phenomenon.

The most extreme versions of BRT creep lead to systems that cannot even truly be recognized as &quot;Bus Rapid Transit&quot;. For example, a rating from the ITDP determined that the Boston Silver Line was best classified as &quot;Not BRT&quot; after local decision makers gradually decided to do away with most BRT-specific features. The study also evaluates New York City&#x27;s Select Bus Service (which is supposed to be BRT-standard) as &quot;Not BRT&quot;.

=== Environmental issues ===

Unlike electric-powered trains commonly used in rapid transit and light rail systems, bus rapid transit often uses diesel- or gasoline-fueled engines. The typical bus diesel engine causes noticeable levels of air pollution, noise and vibration. It is noted however that BRT can still provide significant environmental benefits over private cars. In addition, BRT systems can replace an inefficient conventional bus network for more efficient, faster and less polluting BRT buses. For example, Bogotá previously used 2,700 conventional buses providing transportation to 1.6 million passengers daily, while in 2013 TransMilenio transported 1.9 million passengers using only 630 BRT buses, a fleet less than a quarter in size of the old fleet, that circulates at twice the speed, with a huge reduction in air pollution.

To reduce direct emissions some systems use alternative forms of traction such as electric or hybrid engines. BRT systems can use trolleybuses to lower air pollution and noise emissions such as those in Beijing and Quito. The price penalty of installing overhead lines could be offset by the environmental benefits and potential for savings from centrally generated electricity, especially in cities where electricity is less expensive than other fuel sources. Trolleybus electrical systems can be potentially reused for future light rail conversion. TransJakarta buses use cleaner compressed natural gas-fueled engines, while Bogotá started to use hybrid buses in 2012; these hybrid systems use regenerative braking to charge batteries when the bus stops and then use electric motors to propel the bus up to 40 km/h, then automatically switching to the diesel engine for higher speeds, which allows for considerable savings in fuel consumption and pollutant dispersion.

=== Overcrowding and poor quality service ===

Many BRT systems suffer from overcrowding in buses and stations as well as long wait times for buses. In Santiago de Chile, the average of the system is six passengers per square meter () inside vehicles. Users have reported days where the buses take too long to arrive, and are too overcrowded to accept new passengers. As of June 2017, the system has an approval rating of 15% among commuters, and it has lost 27% of its passengers, who have turned mostly to cars.

In Bogotá the overcrowding was even worse; the average of TransMilenio was eight passengers per square meter (). Only 29% felt satisfied with the system. The data also showed that 23% of the citizens agreed with building more TransMilenio lines, in contrast of the 42% who considered that a rapid transit system should be built. Several cases of sexual assault had been reported by female users in TransMilenio. According to a 2012 survey made by the secretary of the woman of Bogota, 64% of women said they had been victims of sexual assault in the system. The system had even been ranked as the most dangerous transport for women. The poor quality of the system had occasioned an increment in the number of cars and motorcycles in the city; citizens preferred these transport means over TransMilenio. According to official data, the number of cars increased from approximately 666,000 in 2005 to 1,586,700 in 2016. The number of motorcycles was also growing, with 660,000 sold in Bogota in 2013, two times the number of cars sold.&lt;br&gt;At the end of 2018 Transmilenio ordered 1383 new buses as a replacement of the older ones in service. 52% were compressed natural gas (CNG) buses made by Scania with Euro 6 emission rating, 48% were diesel engine made by Volvo with Euro 5 emission rating. More (or renewed?) orders have produced an impressive result: &quot;To improve public and environmental health, the City of Bogotá has assembled a fleet of 1,485 electric buses for its public transportation system - placing the city among the three largest e-bus fleets outside of China.&quot;&lt;br&gt;In the year 2022 Bogotá has won the Sustainable Transport Award, an award given out by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, which is partially funded by bus manufacturers. Reasons stated include the TransMilenio system and its urban cycling strategy.

The system in Jakarta had been experiencing issues, with complaints of overcrowding in buses and stations and low frequency of the routes. There were extensive safety concerns as well; rampant sexual harassment has been reported, and the fire safety of the buses has been under scrutiny after one of the buses, a Zhongtong imported from China, suddenly and spontaneously caught on fire. The quality of the service was so bad that the then-governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, in March 2015 publicly apologized for the poor performance of the system.

=== Failures and reversals ===

The temporary unpopularity of Delhi&#x27;s BRT(2016) and the riots and spontaneous user demonstrations in Bogotá(2016) raised doubts about the ability of BRTs to keep pace with increased ridership. On the other hand the speed of increased BRT ridership confirmed the research finding no general preference for rail over bus, see the end of chapter &quot;Comparison with light rail&quot;. Bogota has regained trust and safety according to the Sustainable Transport Award 2022.

A lack of permanence of BRT has been criticized, with some arguing that BRT systems can be used as an excuse to build roads that others later try to convert for use by non-BRT vehicles. Examples of this can be found in Delhi, where a BRT system was scrapped, and in Aspen, Colorado, where drivers are lobbying the government to allow mixed-use traffic in former BRT lanes as of 2017, although in other US cities, such as Albuquerque, New Mexico, just the opposite is true. Such exuse might be a side effect of the advantages connected with the flexibility of BRT. 

Experts have considered a failure of BRT to land use structure. Some cities that are sprawled and have no mixed use have insufficient ridership to make BRT economically viable. In Africa, the African Urban Institute criticized the viability of ongoing BRTs across the continent.

== Impact ==
A 2018 study found that the introduction of a BRT network in Mexico City reduced air pollution, as measured by emissions of CO, NOX, and PM10.

<text>The B612 Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation headquartered in Mill Valley, California, United States, dedicated to planetary science and planetary defense against asteroids and other near-Earth object (NEO) impacts. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry.

As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. It also assisted the Association of Space Explorers in helping the United Nations establish the International Asteroid Warning Network, as well as a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group to provide oversight on proposed asteroid deflection missions.

In 2012, the foundation announced it would design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space observatory, the Sentinel Space Telescope, to be launched in 2017–2018. Once stationed in a heliocentric orbit around the Sun similar to that of Venus, Sentinel&#x27;s supercooled infrared detector would have helped identify dangerous asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth. In the absence of substantive planetary defense provided by governments worldwide, B612 attempted a fundraising campaign to cover the Sentinel Mission, estimated at $450 million for 10 years of operation. Fundraising was unsuccessful, and the program was cancelled in 2017, with the Foundation pursuing a constellation of smaller satellites instead.

The B612 Foundation is named for the asteroid home of the eponymous hero of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

== Background ==

When an asteroid enters the planet&#x27;s atmosphere it becomes known as a &#x27;meteor&#x27;; those that survive and fall to the Earth&#x27;s surface are then called &#x27;meteorites&#x27;. While basketball-sized meteors occur almost daily, and compact car-sized ones about yearly, they usually burn up or explode high above the Earth as bolides, (fireballs), often with little notice. During an average 24-hour period, the Earth sweeps through some 100 million particles of interplanetary dust and pieces of cosmic debris, only a very minor amount of which arrives on the ground as meteorites.

The larger in size asteroids or other near-Earth objects (NEOs) are, the less frequently they impact the planet&#x27;s atmosphere—large meteors seen in the skies are extremely rare, while medium-sized ones are less so, and much smaller ones are more commonplace. Although stony asteroids often explode high in the atmosphere, some objects, especially iron-nickel meteors and other types descending at a steep angle, can explode close to ground level or even directly impact onto land or sea. In the U.S. State of Arizona, the Meteor Crater (officially named Barringer Crater) formed in a fraction of a second as nearly 160 million tonnes of limestone and bedrock were uplifted, creating its crater rim on formerly flat terrain. The asteroid that produced the Barringer Crater was only about in size; however it impacted the ground at a velocity of and struck with an impact energy of —about 625 times greater than the bomb that destroyed the city of Hiroshima during World War II. Tsunamis can also occur after a medium-sized or larger asteroid impacts an ocean surface or other large body of water.

The probability of a mid-sized asteroid (similar to the one that destroyed the Tunguska River area of Russia in 1908) hitting Earth during the 21st century has been estimated at 30%. Since the Earth is currently more populated than in previous eras, there is a greater risk of large casualties arising from a mid-sized asteroid impact. However, as of the early 2010s, only about a half of one per cent of Tunguska-type NEOs had been located by astronomers using ground-based telescope surveys.

The need for an asteroid detection program has been compared to the need for monsoon, typhoon, and hurricane preparedness. As the B612 Foundation and other organizations have publicly noted, of the different types of natural catastrophes that can occur on our planet, asteroid strikes are the only one that the world now has the technical capability to prevent.

B612 is one of several organizations to propose detailed dynamic surveys of NEOs and preventative measures such as asteroid deflection. Other groups include Chinese researchers, NASA in the United States, NEOShield in Europe, as well as the international Spaceguard Foundation. In December 2009 Roscosmos Russian Federal Space Agency director Anatoly Perminov proposed a deflection mission to the asteroid 99942 Apophis, which at the time had been thought to pose a risk of collision with Earth.

=== Asteroid deflection workshop ===
The Foundation evolved from an informal one-day workshop on asteroid deflection strategies during October 2001, organized by Dutch astrophysicist Piet Hut along with physicist and then-U.S. astronaut Ed Lu, presented at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Twenty researchers participated, principally from various NASA facilities plus the non-profit Southwest Research Institute, but as well from the University of California, University of Michigan, and the Institute for Independent Study. All were interested in contributing to the proposed creation of an asteroid deflection capability. The seminar participants included Rusty Schweickart, a former Apollo astronaut, and Clark Chapman, a planetary scientist.

Among the proposed experimental research missions discussed were the alteration of an asteroid&#x27;s spin rate, as well as changing the orbit of one part of a binary asteroid pair. Following the seminar&#x27;s round-table discussions the workshop generally agreed that the vehicle of choice (needed to deflect an asteroid) would be powered by a low-thrust ion plasma engine. Landing a nuclear-powered plasma engined pusher vehicle on the asteroid&#x27;s surface was seen as promising, an early proposal that would later encounter a number of technical obstacles. Nuclear explosives were seen as &quot;too risky and unpredictable&quot; for several reasons, warranting the view that gently altering an asteroid&#x27;s trajectory was the safest approach—but also a method requiring years of advance warning to successfully accomplish.

== B612 Project and Foundation ==
The October 2001 asteroid deflection workshop participants created the &quot;B612 Project&quot; to further their research. Schweickart, along with Drs. Hut, Lu and Chapman, then formed the B612 Foundation on October 7, 2002, with its first goal being to &quot;significantly alter the orbit of an asteroid in a controlled manner&quot;. Schweickart became an early public face of the foundation and served as chairman on its board of directors. In 2010, as part of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; task force on planetary defense, he advocated increasing NASA&#x27;s annual budget by $250M–$300 million over a 10-year period (with an operational maintenance budget of up to $75 million per year after that) in order to more fully catalog the near-Earth objects (NEOs) that can pose a threat to Earth, and to also fully develop impact avoidance capabilities. That recommended level of budgetary support would permit up to 10–20 years of advance warning in order to create a sufficient window for the required trajectory deflection.

Their recommendations were made to a NASA Advisory Council, but were ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining Congressional funding due to NASA, lacking a legislated mandate for planetary protection, not being permitted to request it. Feeling it would be imprudent to continue waiting for substantive government or United Nations action, B612 began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to cover the approximate US$450 million cost for the development, launch and operations of an asteroid-finding space telescope, to be called Sentinel, with a goal of raising $30 to $40 million per year. The space observatory&#x27;s objective would be to accurately survey NEOs from an orbit similar to that Venus, creating a large dynamic catalog of such objects that would help identify dangerous Earth-impactors, deemed a necessary precursor to mounting any asteroid deflection mission.

In March and April 2013, several weeks after the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion injured some 1,500 people, the U.S. Congress held hearings for &quot;...the Risks, Impacts and Solutions for Space Threats&quot;. They received testimony from B612 head Ed Lu (see video at right), as well as Dr. Donald K. Yeomans, head of NASA&#x27;s NEO Program Office, Dr. Michael A&#x27;Hearn of the University of Maryland and co-chair of a 2009 U.S. National Research Council study on asteroid threats, plus others. The difficulty of quickly intercepting an imminent asteroid threat to Earth was made apparent during the testimony:

As a result of a set of hearings by the NASA Advisory Committee following the Chelyabinsk explosion in 2013, in conjunction with a White House request to double its budget, NASA&#x27;s Near Earth Object Program funding was increased to $40.5 M/year in its FY2014 (Fiscal Year 2014) budget. It had previously been increased to $20.5 M/year in FY2012 (about 0.1% of NASA&#x27;s annual budget at the time), from an average of about $4 M/year between 2002 and 2010.

=== Asteroid hazard reassessment ===
On Earth Day, April 22, 2014, the B612 Foundation formally presented a revised assessment on the frequency of &quot;city-killer&quot; type impact events, based on research led by Canadian planetary scientist Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s (UWO) Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration. Dr. Brown&#x27;s analysis, &quot;A 500-Kiloton Airburst Over Chelyabinsk and An Enhanced Hazard from Small Impactors&quot;, published in the journals Science and Nature, was used to produce a short computer-animated video that was presented to the media at the Seattle Museum of Flight.

The nearly one and a half minute video displayed a rotating globe with the impact points of about 25 asteroids measuring more than one, and up to 600 kilotons of blast force, that struck the Earth from 2000 to 2013 (for comparison, the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was equivalent to about 16 kilotons of TNT blast force). Of those impacts between 2000 and 2013, eight of them were as large, or larger, than the Hiroshima bomb. Only one of the asteroids, 2008 TC3, was detected in advance, some 19 hours before exploding in the atmosphere. As was the case with the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, no warnings were issued for any of the other impacts.

At the presentation, alongside former NASA astronauts Dr. Tom Jones and Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, Foundation head Ed Lu explained that the frequency of dangerous asteroid impacts hitting Earth was from three to ten times greater than previously believed a dozen or so years ago (earlier estimates had pegged the odds as one per 300,000 years). The latest reassessment is based on worldwide infrasound signatures recorded under the auspices of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors the planet for nuclear explosions. Dr. Brown&#x27;s UWO study used infrasound signals generated by asteroids that released more than a kiloton of TNT explosive force. The study suggested that &quot;city-killer&quot; type impact events similar to the Tunguska event of 1908 actually occur on average about once a century instead of every thousand years, as was once previously believed. The 1908 event occurred in the remote, sparsely populated Tunguska area of Siberia, Russia, and is attributed to the likely airburst explosion of an asteroid or comet that destroyed some 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometres (830 sq mi) of forests. The higher frequency of these types of events is interpreted as meaning that &quot;blind luck&quot; has mainly prevented a catastrophic impact over an inhabited area that could kill millions, a point made near the video&#x27;s end.

=== 99942 Apophis ===
During the first decade of the 2000s, there were serious concerns the 325 metres (1,066 ft) wide asteroid 99942 Apophis posed a risk of impacting Earth in 2036. Preliminary, incomplete data by astronomers using ground-based sky surveys resulted in the calculation of a Level 4 risk on the Torino Scale impact hazard chart. In July 2005, B612 formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid&#x27;s post-2029 orbit could be in orbital resonance with Earth, which would increase the likelihood of a future impact. The Foundation also asked NASA to investigate whether a transponder should be placed on the asteroid to enable more accurate tracking of how its orbit would be changed by the Yarkovsky effect.

By 2008, B612 had provided estimates on a 30 kilometers-wide corridor, called a &quot;path of risk&quot;, that would extend across the Earth&#x27;s surface if an impact were to occur, as part of its effort to develop viable deflection strategies. The calculated risk-path extended from Kazakhstan across southern Russia through Siberia, across the Pacific, then right between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, crossing northern Colombia and Venezuela, and ending in the Atlantic just before reaching Africa. At that time, a computer simulation estimated Apophis&#x27;s hypothetical impact in countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, could have resulted in more than 10 million casualties. Alternately, an impact in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans could produce a deadly tsunami over 240 metres (about 800 ft) in height, capable of destroying many coastal areas and cities.

A series of later, more accurate observations of 99942 Apophis, combined with the recovery of previously unseen data, revised the odds of a collision in 2036 as being virtually nil, and effectively ruled it out.

=== International involvement ===
B612 Foundation members assisted the Association of Space Explorers (ASE) in helping obtain United Nations (UN) oversight of NEO tracking and deflection missions through the UN&#x27;s Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) along with COPUOS&#x27;s Action Team 14 (AT-14) expert group. Several members of B612, also members of the ASE, worked with COPUOS since 2001 to establish international involvement for both impact disaster responses, and on deflection missions to prevent impact events. According to Foundation &quot;Chair Emeritus&quot; Rusty Schweickart in 2013, &quot;No government in the world today has explicitly assigned the responsibility for planetary protection to any of its agencies&quot;.

In October 2013, COPUOS&#x27;s Scientific and Technical Subcommittee approved several measures, later approved by the UN General Assembly in December, to deal with terrestrial asteroid impacts, including the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) plus two advisory groups: the Space Missions Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), and the Impact Disaster Planning Advisory Group (IDPAG). The IAWN warning network will act as a clearinghouse for shared information on dangerous asteroids and for any future terrestrial impact events that are identified. The Space Missions Planning Advisory Group will coordinate joint studies of the technologies for deflection missions, and as well provide oversight of actual missions. This is due to deflection missions typically involving a progressive movement of an asteroid&#x27;s predicted impact point across the surface of the Earth (and also across the territories of uninvolved countries) until the NEO is deflected either ahead of, or behind the planet at the point their orbits intersect. An initial framework of international cooperation at the UN is needed, said Schweickart, to guide the policymakers of its member nations on several important NEO-related aspects. However, as asserted by the Foundation, the new UN measures only constitute a starting point. To be effective they will need to be enhanced by further policies and resources implemented at both the national and supernational levels.

At the time of the UN&#x27;s policy adoption in New York City, Schweickart and four other ASE members, including B612 head Ed Lu and strategic advisers Dumitru Prunariu and Tom Jones participated in a public forum moderated by Neil deGrasse Tyson not far from the United Nations Headquarters. The panel urged the global community to adopt further important steps for planetary defense against NEO impacts. Their recommendations included:
* UN delegates briefing their home countries&#x27; policymakers on the UN&#x27;s newest roles;
* having each country&#x27;s government create detailed asteroid disaster response plans, assigning fiscal resources to deal with asteroid impacts, and delegating a lead agency to handle its disaster response in order to create clear lines of communication from the IAWN to the affected countries;
* having their governments support the ASE&#x27;s and B612&#x27;s efforts to identify the estimated one million &quot;city-killer&quot; NEOs capable of impacting Earth, by deploying a space-based asteroid telescope, and
* committing member states to launching an international test deflection mission within 10 years.

== Sentinel Mission ==
The Sentinel Mission program was the cornerstone of the B612 Foundation&#x27;s earlier efforts, with its preliminary design and system architecture level reviews planned for 2014, and its critical design review to be conducted in 2015. The infrared telescope would be launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, to be placed into a Venus-trailing Heliocentric orbit around the Sun. Orbiting between the Sun and Earth, the Sun&#x27;s rays would always be behind the telescope&#x27;s lens and thus never inhibit the space observatory&#x27;s ability to detect asteroids or other near-Earth objects (NEOs). From the vantage of its inner-solar system orbit around the Sun, Sentinel would be able to &quot;pick up objects that are currently difficult, if not impossible, to see in advance from Earth&quot;, such as occurred with the Chelyabinsk meteor of 2013 that went undetected until its explosion over Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. The Sentinel Mission was planned to provide an accurate dynamic catalog of asteroids and other NEOs made available to scientists worldwide from the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Minor Planet Center, the data collected would calculate the risk of impact events with our planet, allowing for asteroid deflection by the use of gravity tractors to divert their trajectories away from Earth.

In order to communicate with the spacecraft while it is orbiting the Sun (at about the same distance as Venus), which can be at times as far as 270 million kilometres (170 million miles) from Earth, the B612 Foundation entered into a Space Act Agreement with NASA for the use of their deep space telecommunication network.

=== Design and operation ===
Sentinel was designed to perform continuous observation and analysis during its planned -year operational life, although B612 anticipates it may continue to function for up to 10 years. Using its telescope mirror with sensors built by Ball Aerospace (makers of the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s instruments), its mission would be to catalog 90% of asteroids with diameters larger than . There were also plans to catalog smaller Solar System objects as well.

The space observatory would measure by with a mass of and would orbit the Sun at a distance of approximately the same orbital distance as Venus, employing infrared astronomy to identify asteroids against the cold of outer space. Sentinel would scan in the 7- to 15-micron wavelength band across a 5.5 by 2-degree field of view. Its sensor array would consist of 16 detectors with coverage scanning &quot;a 200-degree, full-angle field of regard&quot;. B612, working in partnership with Ball Aerospace, was constructing Sentinel&#x27;s 51 cm aluminum mirror, designed for a large field of view with its infrared sensors cooled to using Ball&#x27;s two-stage, closed-Stirling-cycle cryocooler.

B612 aimed to produce its space telescope at a significantly lower cost than traditional space science programs by making use of space hardware systems previously developed for earlier programs, rather than designing a brand new observatory. Schweickart stated that about &quot;80% of what we&#x27;re dealing with in Sentinel is Kepler, 15% Spitzer, 5% new, higher-performance infrared sensors&quot;, thus concentrating its R&amp;D funds on the critical area of cryogenically-cooled image sensor technology, producing what it terms will be the most sensitive type of asteroid-finding telescope ever built.

Data gathered by Sentinel would be provided through existing scientific data-sharing networks that include NASA and academic institutions such as the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Given the satellite&#x27;s telescopic accuracy, Sentinel&#x27;s data may have proven valuable for other possible future missions, such as asteroid mining.

=== Mission funding ===
B612 was attempting to raise approximately $450M to fund the development, launch and operational costs of the telescope, about the cost of a complex freeway interchange, or approximately $100M less than a single Air Force Next-Generation Bomber. The $450 million cost estimate is composed of $250 million to create Sentinel, plus another $200 million for 10 years of operations. In explaining the Foundation&#x27;s bypassing of possible governmental grants for such a mission, Dr. Lu stated their public fundraising appeal is being driven by &quot;[t]he tragedy of the commons: When it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s problem, it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s problem&quot;, referring to a lack of ownership, priority and funding that governments have assigned to asteroid threats, also stating on a different occasion &quot;We&#x27;re the only ones taking it seriously.&quot; According to another B612 board member, Rusty Schweickart, &quot;The good news is, you can prevent it—not just get ready for it! The bad news is, it&#x27;s hard to get anybody to pay attention to it when there are potholes in the road.&quot; After providing earlier Congressional testimony on the issue Schweickart was dismayed to hear from congressional staff members that, while U.S. lawmakers involved in the hearing understood the seriousness of the threat, they would likely not legislate funding for planetary defense as &quot;making the deflection of asteroids a priority might backfire in [their] reelection campaigns&quot;.

The Foundation intended to launch Sentinel in 2017–2018, with initiation of data transfer for on-Earth processing anticipated no later than 6 months afterwards.

In the aftermath of the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion—where an approximate asteroid entered the atmosphere undetected at about Mach 60, becoming a brilliant superbolide meteor before exploding over Chelyabinsk, Russia—the B612 foundation experienced a &quot;surge of interest&quot; in its project to detect asteroids, with a corresponding increase in funding donations. After providing Congressional testimony Dr. Lu noted that the many online videos recorded of the asteroid&#x27;s explosion over Chelyabinsk made a significant impact on millions of viewers worldwide, saying &quot;There&#x27;s nothing like a hundred YouTube videos to do that.&quot;

== Staff ==

=== Leadership ===
In 2014 eight key staff positions were designated, covering the offices of the chief executive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO), Sentinel Program Architecture (SPA), Sentinel Mission Direction (SMD), Sentinel Program Management (SPM), Sentinel Mission Science (SMS) and the Sentinel Standing Review Team (SSRT), plus Public Relations.

==== Ed Lu, Co-founder, B612 Foundation. Executive Director, Asteroid Institute ====
Edward Tsang &quot;Ed&quot; Lu (; born July 1, 1963) is a co-founder and the chief executive officer of the B612 Foundation, and as well, a U.S. physicist and a former NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions and an extended stay aboard the International Space Station which included a six-hour spacewalk outside the station performing construction work. During his three missions he logged a total of 206 days in space.

== Deflection methods ==

A number of methods have been devised to &#x27;deflect&#x27; an asteroid or other NEO away from an Earth-impacting trajectory, so that it can entirely avoid entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Given sufficient advance lead time, a change to the body&#x27;s velocity of as little as one centimetre per second will allow it to avoid hitting the Earth. Proposed and experimental deflection methods include ion beam shepherds, focused solar energy and the use of mass drivers or solar sails.

Initiating a nuclear explosive device above, on, or slightly beneath, the surface of a threatening NEO is a potential deflection option, with the optimal detonation height dependent upon the NEO&#x27;s composition and size. In the case of a threatening &quot;rubble pile&quot;, the stand off, or detonation height above the surface configuration has been put forth as a means to prevent the potential fracturing of the rubble pile. However, given sufficient advance warning of an asteroid&#x27;s impact, most scientists avoid endorsing explosive deflection due to the number of potential issues involved. Other methods that can accomplish NEO deflections include:

=== Gravity tractor ===

An alternative to an explosive deflection is to move a dangerous asteroid slowly and consistently over time. The effect of a tiny constant thrust can accumulate to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. In 2005 Drs. Ed Lu and Stanley G. Love proposed using a large, heavy uncrewed spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The method will function due to the spacecraft&#x27;s and asteroid&#x27;s mutually gravitational attraction. When the spacecraft counters the gravitational attraction towards the asteroid by the use of, for example, an ion thruster engine, the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated, or moved, towards the spacecraft and thus slowly deflected from the orbital path that will lead it to a collision with Earth.

While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of an asteroid&#x27;s composition. It would even be effective on a comet, loose rubble pile, or an object spinning at a high rate. However, a gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years stationed beside and tugging on the body to be effective. The Sentinel Space Telescope&#x27;s mission is designed to provide the required advance lead time.

According to Rusty Schweickart, the gravitational tractor method also has a controversial aspect because during the process of changing an asteroid&#x27;s trajectory, the point on Earth where it would most likely hit would slowly be shifted temporarily across the face of the planet. It means the threat for the entire planet might be minimized at a temporary cost of some specific states&#x27; security. Schweickart recognizes that choosing the manner and direction the asteroid should be &quot;dragged&quot; may be a difficult international decision, and one that should be made through the United Nations.

An early NASA analysis of deflection alternatives in 2007, stated: &quot;&#x27;Slow push&#x27; mitigation techniques are the most expensive, have the lowest level of technical readiness, and their ability to both travel to and divert a threatening NEO would be limited unless mission durations of many years to decades are possible.&quot; But a year later in 2008 the B612 Foundation released a technical evaluation of the gravity tractor concept, produced on contract to NASA. Their report confirmed that a transponder-equipped tractor &quot;with a simple and robust spacecraft design&quot; can provide the needed towing service for a 140-meters-diameter equivalent, Hayabusa-shaped asteroid or other NEO.

=== Kinetic impact ===

When the asteroid is still far from Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its momentum by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid. The further away from the Earth, the smaller the required impact force becomes. Conversely, the closer a dangerous near-Earth Object (NEO) is to Earth at the time of its discovery, the greater the force that is required to make it deviate from its collision trajectory with the Earth. Closer to Earth, the impact of a massive spacecraft is a possible solution to a pending NEO impact.

In 2005, in the wake of the successful U.S. mission that crashed its Deep Impact probe into Comet Tempel 1, China announced its plan for a more advanced version: the landing of a spacecraft probe on a small NEO in order to push it off course. In the 2000s the European Space Agency (ESA) began studying the design of a space mission named Don Quijote, which, if flown, would have been the first intentional asteroid deflection mission ever designed. ESA&#x27;s Advanced Concepts Team also demonstrated theoretically that a deflection of 99942 Apophis could be achieved by sending a spacecraft weighing less than a tonne to impact against the asteroid.

ESA had originally identified two NEOs as possible targets for its Quijote mission: and (10302) 1989 ML. Neither asteroid represents a threat to Earth. In a subsequent study, two different possibilities were selected: the Amor asteroid 2003 SM84 and 99942 Apophis; the latter is of particular significance to Earth as it will make a close approach in 2029 and 2036. In 2005, ESA announced at the 44th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference that its mission would be combined into a joint ESA-NASA Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, proposed for 2019–2022. The target selected for AIDA will be a binary asteroid, so that the deflection effect could also be observed from Earth by timing the rotation period of the binary pair. AIDA&#x27;s new target, a component of binary asteroid 65803 Didymos, will be impacted at a velocity of 22,530 km/h (14,000 mph)

A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: &quot;Non-nuclear kinetic impactors are the most mature approach and could be used in some deflection/mitigation scenarios, especially for NEOs that consist of a single small, solid body.&quot;

== Funding status ==
The B612 Foundation is a California 501(c)(3) non-profit, private foundation. Financial contributions to the B612 Foundation are tax-exempt in the United States. Its principal offices are in Mill Valley, California; they were previously located in Tiburon, California.

Fund raising has not gone well for B612 as of June 2015. With an overall goal to raise for the project, the foundation raised only approximately in 2012 and in 2013.

== Foundation name ==

The B612 Foundation is named in tribute to the eponymous home asteroid of the hero of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s best-selling philosophical fable of &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; (&quot;The Little Prince&quot;). In aviation&#x27;s early pioneer years of the 1920s, Saint-Exupéry made an emergency landing on top of an African mesa covered with crushed white limestone seashells. Walking around in the moonlight he kicked a black rock and soon deduced it was a meteorite that had fallen from space.

That experience later contributed, in 1943, to his literary creation of Asteroid B-612 in his philosophical fable of a little prince fallen to Earth, with the home planetoid&#x27;s name having been adapted from one of the mail planes Saint-Exupéry once flew, bearing the registration marking A-612.

Also inspired by the story is an asteroid discovered in 1993, though not identified as posing any threat to Earth, named &quot;46610 Bésixdouze&quot; (the numerical part of its designation represented in hexadecimal as &#x27;B612&#x27;, while the textual part is French for &quot;B six twelve&quot;). As well, a small asteroid moon, &quot;Petit-Prince&quot;, discovered in 1998 is named in part after &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC; ), often shortened to the Ontario PC Party (or simply the PCs), colloquially known as the Tories, is a centre to centre-right political party in Ontario, Canada.

During its uninterrupted governance from 1943 to 1985, the Ontario PC Party adhered to the ideology of Red Toryism, favouring government intervention in the economy, increased spending on infrastructure, education and health care and being progressive on social issues such as equal pay for women, anti-discrimination laws, voting rights for First Nations people and French-language services. In the 1990s, the party underwent a shift to Blue Toryism after the election of Mike Harris as leader, who was premier from 1995 to 2002 and favoured a &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; platform of cutting taxes and government spending while balancing the budget through small government. The PCs lost power in 2003; however, they came back to win a majority government in 2018 under Doug Ford. They were reelected in 2022 and 2025.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The first Conservative Party in Upper Canada was made up of United Empire Loyalists and supporters of the wealthy Family Compact that ruled the colony. Once responsible government was granted in response to the 1837 Rebellions, the Tories emerged as moderate reformers who opposed the radical policies of the Reformers and then the Clear Grits.

The modern Conservative Party originated in the Liberal-Conservative coalition founded by Sir John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier in 1854. It is a variant of this coalition that formed the first government in Ontario with John Sandfield Macdonald as premier.

Until becoming the Progressive Conservatives in 1942, the party was officially known as the &quot;Liberal-Conservative Association of Ontario&quot;, reflecting its liberal-conservative origins, but became widely known as the Conservative Party.

=== Confederation ===
John Sandfield Macdonald was actually a Liberal and sat concurrently as a Liberal Party of Canada member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada but he was an ally of John A. Macdonald (though not a relative). His government was initially a true coalition of Liberals and Conservatives under his leadership but soon the more radical Reformers bolted to the opposition and Sandfield Macdonald was left leading what was essentially a conservative coalition that included some Liberals under the Liberal-Conservative banner. After losing power in 1871, this conservative coalition began to dissolve. What was originally a party that included Catholics and Protestants became an almost exclusively English and Protestant party, more and more dependent on the Protestant Orange Order for support, and even for its leadership. The party became opposed to funding for separate (Catholic) schools, opposed to language rights for French-Canadians, and distrustful of immigrants. Paradoxically, an element of the party gained a reputation for being pro-labour as a result of links between the Orange Order and the labour movement.

===Pre-war dynasty===
After 33 years in Opposition, the Tories returned to power under James P. Whitney, who led a progressive administration in its development of the province. The Whitney government initiated massive public works projects such as the creation of Ontario Hydro. It also enacted reactionary legislation (such as Regulation 17) against the French-Canadian population in Ontario. The Tories were in power for all but five years from 1905 to 1934. After the death of Whitney in 1914, however, they lacked vision and became complacent. The Tories lost power to the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1919 election but were able to regain office in 1923 election due to the UFO&#x27;s disintegration and divisions in the Ontario Liberal Party. They were defeated by Mitch Hepburn&#x27;s Liberals in 1934 due to their inability to cope with the Great Depression.

===Post-war dynasty===
Late in the 1930s and early in the 1940s, the Conservatives re-organized and developed new policies. Rather than continue to oppose government spending and intervention, a policy which hurt the party politically in the time of the Great Depression, the Conservatives changed their policies to support government action where it would lead to economic growth.

The party changed its name to the &quot;Progressive Conservative&quot; party after its federal counterpart changed its name to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in December 1942 on the insistence of its new leader, John Bracken, whose roots were in the populist Progressive Party.

The Progressive Conservatives took advantage of Liberal infighting to win a minority government in the 1943 provincial election, reducing the Liberals to third-party status. Drew called another election in 1945, only two years into his mandate, to get a majority government. The PCs played up Cold War tensions to win a landslide majority, though it emerged several years later that the PC government had set up a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police to spy on the opposition and the media. The PCs would dominate Ontario politics for the next four decades.

Under Drew and his successor, Leslie Frost, the PCs were a strong champion of rural issues but also invested heavily in the development of civil works throughout the province, including the construction of the 400 series of highways, beginning with the 401 across Toronto. On social issues, Frost&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government passed anti-discrimination laws such as the Fair Employment Practices Act of 1951, the Fair Accommodation Practices Act of 1954 and the Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission Act of 1958, advocated equal wages for women with the Act to Ensure Fair Remuneration for Female Employees, and granted First Nations people the right to vote in 1955. Frost improved health care access to Ontarians through the passing of the Hospital Services Commission of Ontario Act of 1956 and the launching of the Ontario Hospital Insurance Plan program in 1959. In 1961, John Robarts became the 17th premier of Ontario. He was one of the most popular premiers in years. Under Robarts&#x27;s leadership, the party epitomized power, continuing Drew and Frost&#x27;s policies on health care, education, infrastructure and social issues, introducing the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1962. He was an advocate of individual freedoms and promoted the rights of the provinces against what he saw as the centralizing initiatives of the federal government, while also promoting national unity against Quebec separatism. He hosted the 1967 &quot;Confederation of Tomorrow&quot; conference in Toronto in an unsuccessful attempt to achieve an agreement for a new Constitution of Canada.

Robarts opposed Canadian Medicare when it was proposed, but later endorsed it fully, and the party implemented the public health care system that continues to this day. He led the party towards a civil libertarian movement. As a strong believer in the promotion of both official languages, he opened the door to French education in Ontario schools.

===Big Blue Machine===
In 1971, Bill Davis became party leader and the 18th premier. Anti-Catholicism became an issue again in the 1971 election, when the Tories campaigned strenuously against a Liberal proposal to extend funding for Catholic separate schools until Grade 13. Davis reversed himself in 1985, and enacted the funding extension as one of his last acts before leaving office.

Davis governed until 1985 with a team of advisers known as the &quot;Big Blue Machine&quot; because of their reputed political and strategic skills. Their stamp on the party was so strong that many refer to the Tories&#x27; long rule over Ontario as the &quot;Big Blue Machine era&quot;.

During its 43 years of domination, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario was seen as a centrist party, with the Liberals being to its right and the New Democratic Party to its left. However, its base of support remained with socially conservative voters in rural Southern Ontario. Davis largely reconciled these differences and emerged one of the most popular politicians in Ontario&#x27;s history. Other conservatives in the federal PC Party accused him of damaging the conservative image in Canada by moving to the left on some issues. Davis continued the rapid expansion of community colleges, universities, and highways across Ontario.

===1980s to 1995: in Opposition===

Davis retired in 1985. At a leadership convention, he was succeeded by Industry and Trade Minister Frank Miller. A Blue Tory, Miller was considerably more conservative than Davis, and shifted the Progressive Conservatives to the right. Soon after taking office, he called an election in which the PCs were reduced to a minority government, and actually finished behind the Liberals in the popular vote for the first time in 42 years.

Soon afterward, the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) of Bob Rae reached an agreement with David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals in which the NDP would support a Liberal minority government. Miller was defeated in a no-confidence motion on June 18. Peterson was asked to form a government later in the day, ending the longest period of one-party rule in Canadian provincial history. Miller was replaced as leader by Larry Grossman at a second leadership convention.

When the Liberal-NDP Accord expired, an election was held in 1987 in which the Tories were reduced to third place in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. They only won 16 seats, their worst showing in over half a century. Grossman was personally defeated in his downtown Toronto riding and resigned immediately. Andy Brandt was the party&#x27;s interim leader until a leadership election was held in 1990 in which Mike Harris defeated Dianne Cunningham.

Three months after the election of Harris, and only three years into the, typically, four-year term of the Liberal government, David Peterson called a provincial election, in which the PCs failed to improve their standing, but which resulted in the defeat of the Liberals by Rae&#x27;s NDP.

===Mike Harris and the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;===
In the 1995 election, Harris catapulted his party from third place to an election victory, running on a small government platform called the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;. The platform promised tax cuts (including 30% cuts to provincial personal income tax), and adopted wedge issues including deficit reduction, welfare cuts, the introduction of workfare, and the repeal of an employment equity law Harris characterized as &quot;the quota law.&quot;

Public opinion on the Harris government was polarized. The government was criticized on issues such as health care, the environment, education, and social policies. Strikes and protests including a 1997 teacher&#x27;s strike beleaguered its first term. But it won a second majority in the 1999 general election, and held generally stable support until Harris&#x27;s departure as party leader in 2002.

A slide in PC support began in early 2000 according to Ipsos-Reid, when the Tories fell behind the Liberals in the public opinion polls for the first time since the 1999 election, with 36% support of those polled, compared to 42% for the Liberals and 17% for the NDP. Later in 2000, Liberal support rose to about half of those polled, while PC support remained in the low 30s. This pattern held through to the 2002 leadership campaign, when PC support rose to 37%, while the Liberals retained the support of about half of those polled.

===Ernie Eves: distancing the party from Harris and 2003 defeat===
With the resignation of Mike Harris in 2002, the PCs held a leadership election. Ernie Eves, who had been Harris&#x27;s minister of finance, and who had the backing of almost all PC members of provincial parliament (MPPs), won the campaign, defeating his successor as minister of finance, Jim Flaherty.

Eves was a Red Tory, unlike Harris. He&#x27;d tried to blunt some of the edges of the more radical elements of Harris&#x27;s platform while in Cabinet. His distancing from the Common Sense Revolution continued after he became premier. He killed plans to sell off Hydro One and re-imposed retail price controls on electricity, capping the price at 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and vowing to keep it capped until at least 2006.

During the summer after Eves&#x27;s election as leader, the PCs closed the gap in popular support considerably, placing only two percentage points behind the Liberals in two summer public opinion polls. By the autumn of 2002, however, Eves&#x27;s &quot;honeymoon&quot; with the voters was over, and the party fell back in the polls, hovering in the mid-to-high 30s, while the Liberals scored in the mid-to-high 40s.

Despite his attempt to recast the Tory government as a moderate one, Eves was unable to reverse the slide in the polls the Tories had suffered in the last years of Harris&#x27;s tenure.

Eves asked Flaherty&#x27;s campaign chairman, Jaime Watt, to co-manage the PC election campaign, along with the rest of the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; team that had previously worked for Harris. Only Tom Long, the central organizer in Harris&#x27;s campaigns, refused to work for Eves.

The &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; reputation for competence was marred by publicity stunts such as handing down his government&#x27;s second budget at the headquarters of Magna International instead of in the provincial legislature. Voter backlash against this break with parliamentary tradition forced the delay of a planned spring election in 2003.

In May 2003, Eves released the party&#x27;s platform, &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;. The document promoted an aggressive hard-right agenda, and was closer in spirit to Harris and Flaherty&#x27;s agenda than to Eves&#x27;s own. In releasing this document, Eves reversed his earlier positions on banning teacher&#x27;s strikes, jailing the homeless, private school tax credits and same-sex marriage. The platform also called for mortgage interest deductibility.

The PC election campaign was riddled with mistakes and miscues, and Eves appeared uncomfortable trying to sell a platform he had opposed only a year earlier. In contrast, the Liberals had spent the last four years positioning themselves as the government in waiting, and ran on the simple platform of &quot;Choose Change&quot;. PC television ads which attacked Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty as &quot;still not up to the job&quot; were received poorly by the voting public, and allowed the Liberal campaign to portray the Tories as needlessly confrontational.

A critical point in the campaign was when a member of the Eves team jokingly referred to McGuinty as an &quot;evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet&quot;, a comment that made the Tories appear desperate to vilify their opponents. In the final days leading up to the vote, Eves was further criticized for saying that McGuinty just says &quot;whatever comes into his pointy little head&quot;. On election day, the Tories were routed, falling to 24 seats.

===Opposition under John Tory (2004 to 2009)===
In early 2004, Eves announced his intention to step down as leader. A leadership convention to replace him was called for the fall.

Jim Flaherty was the first to enter the race, campaigning on the same right wing platform as in 2002. He was soon opposed by John Tory, a former executive with Rogers Cable and a Toronto mayoral candidate in 2003 (a position he would ultimately win in 2014), sometimes viewed as a Red Tory due to his association to former premier Bill Davis. MPP Frank Klees, the third candidate in the race, was a supporter of the Common Sense Revolution and campaigned for a parallel private health care system.

The 2004 leadership election was held on September 18, 2004, electing John Tory as the party&#x27;s new leader. Tory, who had first worked as an aide to Premier Bill Davis, was elected to the Ontario legislature in a by-election in March, 2005, in the seat that Eves held.

In polling prior to the 2007 general election, the PCs&#x27; support rose after the first Liberal budget in 2004. The party was virtually tied with the Liberals, as Tory has experimented with several different orientations. During his first year as leader, Tory attempted to rise above partisan politics, openly contemptuous of partisan moves and pledging to improve decorum in the legislature. In his second year as leader, Tory adopted a more traditional approach to the issues, sharply opposing the Liberal plans on taxes, spending, deficits and cuts. Heading into the election year, Tory put most of his emphasis on criticizing the government&#x27;s handling of a standoff with Mohawk aboriginals in Caledonia in order to portray the government as weak. He also emphasized traditional right-wing issues like taxes, crime and government spending.

During the 2006 PC Policy Convention, Tory introduced his plan for shaping up the PCs&#x27; platform for the 2007 election campaign. His ideas were stated in what have been called &quot;The White Papers&quot;.

The party experienced a drop in popularity, however, after Tory pledged to provide government funding for faith-based schools. The proposal, which proved to be unpopular with voters, contributed largely to the party&#x27;s loss. The Liberals won a second majority government, and the PCs made negligible gains in the legislature (one more seat, but a 3 per cent drop in the popular vote). Tory, who had left his Dufferin–Peel–Wellington–Grey seat to run in Don Valley West, would lose to Liberal incumbent Kathleen Wynne.

==== 2008 party convention and the leadership review question====

As a result of the election loss, the party decided to hold a leadership review vote at its 2008 General Party Meeting in London. The Ontario PC Party&#x27;s constitution requires that the party hold a leadership review vote at the first party convention after an election defeat.

From the election day until the 2008 General Meeting, party members were divided into two &quot;camps&quot;: those who supported John Tory&#x27;s position as party leader and those who opposed his leadership. Several campaigns to oust John Tory as leader of the party, most notably by a party activist group led by former party president Rueben Devlin called &quot;Grassroots PC&quot;. John Tory had the public support of the PC legislative caucus, and most notably, support from former premiers and predecessors Ernie Eves and Bill Davis.

The lead-up to the review vote was marked by high emotions on both sides of the debate and allegations of rule breaking. Such allegations were risen when caucus members sent letters on party letterhead seeking support for Tory. The letters signed by Tory MPPs Bob Runciman and Toby Barrett were a clear violation of the rules of the party, as the party in general is supposed to be neutral on the leadership review question. Tory responded by stating that he and his supporters will reimburse the party for the letters that the caucus members had sent in support of Tory&#x27;s position as leaders. As a result, the party&#x27;s president, Blair McCreadie, had stated that the matter is closed. A supporter of Tory&#x27;s, PC Youth President Andrew Brander, launched a series of last-minute challenges of delegates on the grounds that they are representing ridings where they neither live nor work.

Tory received 66.9% support, lower than internal tracking which showed him more comfortably in the 70 per cent range - appeared to come as a shock to Tory. The percentage of support received by Tory was nearly identical to Joe Clark&#x27;s 1983 support when he was federal PC leader, which resulted in Clark resigning as leader, and is often seen as the benchmark for Canadian party leaders to get to stay on as leader.

Three hours after the leadership review vote, John Tory announced to the delegates at the Ontario PC&#x27;s general meeting that he would stay on as leader of the Party. Tory came under heavy criticism from several party members following this delay, with his opponents signalling that they would continue to call for an end to what they called his &#x27;weak&#x27; leadership. Other party members, such as former Mike Harris&#x27;s chief of staff Guy Giorno and interim leader of the opposition Bob Runciman, supported John Tory, saying that his opponents should accept the results and move on.

===Opposition under Tim Hudak (2009 to 2014)===


John Tory announced his pending resignation as leader on March 6, 2009; the day following his defeat in a by-election for Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock. On June 27, 2009, party members elected Tim Hudak as the party&#x27;s new leader. Christine Elliott, Frank Klees, and Randy Hillier were the unsuccessful candidates.

Hudak led the PCs through two elections. In the 2011 provincial election, the McGuinty Liberal government was reduced to a minority. Hudak&#x27;s Tories were widely expected to win the 2014 provincial election but the Liberals, now led by Kathleen Wynne, were returned with a majority government largely due to Hudak&#x27;s campaign pledge to cut 100,000 public service jobs by attrition rather than by layoffs. Hudak resigned in the aftermath. On July 2, 2014, Jim Wilson was chosen by the Progressive Conservative caucus to be its interim leader until the 2015 leadership election.

===Opposition under Patrick Brown (2015 to 2018)===


On May 9, 2015, the membership elected Patrick Brown, a federal Conservative MP from Barrie, as the leader of the party. Christine Elliott was the unsuccessful candidate with Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, and Monte McNaughton withdrawing prior to the vote.

Since he did not hold a seat in the Legislature, the party requested that MPP Garfield Dunlop resign his seat in Simcoe North so that Brown could run. Brown was elected as MPP for Simcoe North in a by-election held September 3, 2015.

At the party&#x27;s 2016 Annual General Meeting (the first since the leadership election) Brown announced that the PCs would take on a more inclusive and compassionate tone, shifting to the political centre by reach out to groups that do not typically support the party including trade unions, and pursue &quot;sensible&quot; carbon pricing. He also unveiled a new logo to represent the commitment to &quot;inclusion, renewal, openness and change&quot;. Brown stated his intention to change the party by moving away from past campaigns where one particular issue often cost them support, such as Tim Hudak&#x27;s proposed public sector job cuts in the 2014 election or John Tory&#x27;s proposal to extend public funding to all faith-based schools in 2007.

At the PC&#x27;s weekend policy convention on November 25, 2017, their &quot;People&#x27;s Guarantee&quot; platform was released. Brown&#x27;s platform was described as centrist on many issues, and included proposals such as opting-in to the federal carbon tax &quot;backstop&quot; (while criticizing the Liberal&#x27;s cap-and-trade system) and providing child care subsidies. Brown&#x27;s platform also included more traditional PC platform items relating to cutting taxes and user fees, such as a 12 percent reduction in hydro bills, cutting &quot;middle-class taxes by 22 per cent&quot;, and a commitment to balancing the provincial budget. Brown also attempted to distance himself from socially conservative policies, declaring himself pro-choice, and refusing to discuss abortion and gay marriage issues at the policy convention, stating that he believed the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the party was on board with socially progressive policies.

Led by the Campaign Life Coalition, a socially conservative anti-abortion organization that had supported Brown&#x27;s leadership bid and disapproved of his move to the centre a breakaway party called &quot;Ontario Alliance&quot; was formed to represent disaffected social conservatives. Similarly, the Trillium Party of Ontario aimed to represent conservative libertarians who have been left out. In particular, Brown expelled Carleton—Mississippi Mills MPP and former Ontario Land Association president Jack MacLaren out of the party after he made negative disparaging comments about Francophone language rights. MacLaren subsequently crossed the floor to become the Trillium Party&#x27;s first member in the Ontario Legislature. As well, some conservatives in Northern Ontario who have felt unrepresented by the Tories and alienated by the party leadership have joined the Northern Ontario Party.

On January 24, 2018, Brown was accused by two women of engaging in sexual misconduct. Brown denied the allegations and initially refused to step down. After pressure from within the party caucus, including calls for his resignation by deputy PC leaders Sylvia Jones and Steve Clark, he resigned as leader in the early hours of January 25, with some aspects of the allegations later proving to be false or unconfirmed.

===Transition under Vic Fedeli (January to March 2018)===
With Brown&#x27;s resignation occurring less than five months before the next provincial election, the party executive met on January 25, 2018, to determine whether to have the next Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election before the provincial election, and if so how it will proceed, or whether to have the interim leader lead the party into the election. Vic Fedeli, Nipissing MPP and former mayor of North Bay, was chosen as interim leader by caucus on January 26, 2018. The Party held a leadership convention on March 10, 2018.

Fedeli&#x27;s first major task as interim leader was to investigate the allegations of questionable spending on lawsuits and unsubstantiated favours to allies during Brown&#x27;s tenure. Party president Rick Dykstra resigned on January 28, 2018. He indicated that it was time for &quot;someone else to lead us through the hard work&quot;. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine revealed allegations of sexual assault against Dykstra, stemming from a 2014 incident when Dykstra was a federal MP. Several other key party and campaign staffers were dismissed or their positions eliminated due to a &quot;reorganization&quot; in the days after Brown&#x27;s resignation.

=== Government under Doug Ford (March 2018 to present) ===

On March 10, 2018, former Toronto city councillor Doug Ford, the brother of the late former mayor of Toronto Rob Ford and son of the late former MPP Doug Ford Sr., was elected as leader of the PC Party, narrowly defeating runner-up Christine Elliott on the third ballot with 50.6% of allocated points, although Elliot had more votes. Due to not having a seat in the legislature, Ford chose to have Vic Fedeli remain as leader of the opposition prior to the 2018 election.

On June 7, 2018, Ford led the PCs to a majority government. The Tories won 76 of 124 seats and 40.5% of the vote.

In the 2022 Ontario general election, Ford led the PCs to another victory winning with an increased majority.

<text>The Sea Hawk is a 1915 novel by Rafael Sabatini. The story is set over the years 1588–1593 and concerns a retired Cornish seafaring gentleman, Sir Oliver Tressilian, who is villainously betrayed by a jealous half-brother. After being forced to serve as a slave on a galley, Sir Oliver is liberated by Barbary pirates. He joins the pirates, gaining the name &quot;Sakr-el-Bahr&quot; (the hawk of the sea), and swears vengeance against his brother.
==Plot summary==
Sir Oliver Tressilian lives at the estate of Penarrow with his brother, Lionel. Oliver is betrothed to Rosamund Godolphin, whose hot-headed brother, Peter, detests the Tressilians due to an old feud between their fathers. Peter and Rosamund&#x27;s guardian, Sir John Killigrew, also has little love for the Tressilians.

Peter&#x27;s manipulations drive Oliver into a duel with Sir John. The scheme backfires: Sir John is seriously wounded, further stoking Peter&#x27;s hatred. Peter attempts to bait Oliver into a violent confrontation, but Oliver is mindful of Rosamund&#x27;s warning never to meet her brother in an affair of honor. One evening, Lionel returns home, bloodied and exhausted. He has killed Peter in a duel, but there were no witnesses. Oliver is widely believed to be Peter&#x27;s killer, and Lionel does nothing to disprove the accusations. To avoid repercussions for Peter&#x27;s death, Lionel has Oliver kidnapped and sold into slavery to ensure that he never reveals the truth. En route to the New World, the slave ship is boarded by the Spanish, and her crew are added to the slaves.

For six months Oliver toils at the oars of a Spanish galley. He befriends a Moorish slave, Yusuf-ben-Moktar. Oliver, Yusuf and the other slaves are freed when the galley is boarded by Muslim corsairs. They offer to fight for the Muslims. Oliver&#x27;s fighting skills and the testimony of Yusuf, the nephew of the Basha of Algiers, grants Oliver special privileges in Muslim society. He becomes the corsair known as &quot;Sakr-el-Bahr&quot;, &quot;the Hawk of the Sea&quot;. In this new role, Oliver rescues English slaves by purchasing them himself and releasing them in Italy.

Oliver captures a Spanish vessel and discovers his one-time kidnapper, Jasper Leigh, as a slave at the oars. He gives Jasper the opportunity to convert to Islam and join his corsairs. With Jasper&#x27;s navigational skills, Sakr-el-Bahr sets sail for England to take revenge on Lionel.

Lionel has taken possession of Penarrow. He is now betrothed to Rosamund, who believes that Oliver murdered her brother. Sakr-el-Bahr carries them off to Algiers to be sold as slaves. The Basha takes a fancy to Rosamund, and plans to buy her himself. The Basha does not have enough ready cash to meet the high bid, and Sakr-el-Bahr wins her instead. The Basha threatens to take her by force, but Sakr-el-Bahr marries her, foiling the Basha&#x27;s efforts. He also buys Lionel and tricks him into revealing the truth about Peter&#x27;s death.

==Film adaptations ==
*Frank Lloyd directed and produced &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1924), a silent film adaptation of the novel, which was fairly faithful to Sabatini&#x27;s original plot.
*The well-known film &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940), starring Errol Flynn, was originally planned as an adaptation of the novel, but an entirely different story was substituted under the same title. Still a swashbuckling tale, however, the film used some footage taken directly from the 1924 adaptation.

<text>Pal Engjëlli (; 1416–1470) was an Albanian Roman Catholic cardinal, clergyman, scholar, and Archbishop of Durazzo who in 1462 wrote the first known sentence retrieved so far in Albanian. Pal Engjëlli was a part of the Engjëlli family. His father was Andrea Engjëlli and his mother was Dorothea Arianiti. Pauli Angeli is reported to have been a friend, co-worker and close counselor of Skanderbeg. As his envoy, he frequently traveled abroad, seeking for aid in the war against the Ottoman Empire. 

Angeli managed to convince Lekë Dukagjini to leave Ottomans and later reconcile with Skanderbeg, and also to convince Skanderbeg to violate an armistice signed with the Ottomans.

==The Baptism Formula Document==

The sentence was the baptismal formula in the Gheg Albanian (): &quot;Un&#x27;te paghesont&#x27; pr&#x27;emenit t&#x27;Atit e t&#x27;Birit e t&#x27;Spertit Senit.&quot; () and in the Tosk-based standard: ).

The formula was found in a pastoral letter written in the Latin script by Angeli after his visit to the Church of Holy Trinity in Mat. The letter is dated 8 November 1462. The formula was meant to be used by Albanian priests to render the ritual understandable for people ignorant of Latin. Probably it was meant also to be used by Albanian people in the countryside, unable to take their children to be baptized to a church. The formula was approved by a synod in Mat, Albania, in 1462.

The document containing the baptismal formula is held in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence, Italy. It was discovered in 1915 by the Romanian scholar Nicolae Iorga.

<text>Hau Pei-tsun (, 8 August 1919 – 30 March 2020) was a Chinese politician and military officer who was the Premier of the Republic of China (ROC) from 1 June 1990 to 27 February 1993, and the longest-serving Chief of the General Staff of the Republic of China Armed Forces from 1 December 1981 to 4 December 1989. On 6 July 2017, Hau attended an academic meeting in Nanjing about the history of the Second Sino-Japanese War, making him the first former ROC premier to visit Mainland China since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He died in March 2020 at age 100.

==Biography==
Born to an upper-class family in Yancheng, Jiangsu, on 8 August 1919, Hau received a military education from the Republic of China Military Academy, National Defense University, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the War College, Armed Forces University. Hau was appointed an artillery officer in 1938, and served in the Chinese expeditionary forces in India during World War II. In the subsequent Chinese Civil War he was a staff officer.

As commander of the 9th Infantry Division from 1958 to 1961, Hau presided over handling the 44-day bombardment of Quemoy by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. He commanded the 3rd Corps from 1963 to 1965 and served as Chief Aide to Chiang Kai-shek from 1965 to 1970. He continued his army career as Commander of the 1st Field Army from 1970 to 1973, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the ROC Army from 1975 to 1977, Executive Vice Chief of the General Staff in the Ministry of National Defense from 1977 to 1978, Commander-in-Chief of the ROC Army 1978 to 1981, and Chief of the General Staff in the Ministry of National Defense from 1981 to 1989. whereas he received the instruction of President Chiang Ching-kuo to investigate the Lieyu Massacre in May 1987.

He was a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang from 1984 to 1993 and served as Minister of National Defense from 1989 until 1990 when he was appointed Premier. He was appointed by President Lee Teng-hui in part to mollify the conservative mainlander faction within the KMT that had threatened to run a rival presidential ticket in the March 1990 election. Hau&#x27;s appointment sparked protests by those who believed it marked retrogression toward military rule, while President Lee defended his decision by saying he valued Hau&#x27;s tough stance on crime. As premier he held high approval ratings (even higher than Lee&#x27;s)—he was tough on crime and promoted a multibillion-dollar economic development plan to industrialize Taiwan. Hau submitted his resignation in January 1993 after the KMT&#x27;s poor showing in the 1992 Legislative Yuan election.

Appointed as one of four vice-chairmen of the KMT in the 14th Party Congress (immediately following the defection of the New Kuomintang Alliance) in another effort by Lee to pacify the mainlander faction, Hau served from 1993 to 1995.

He was expelled from the Kuomintang for his support of New Party candidates in the 1995 legislative elections, and was named Lin Yang-kang&#x27;s running mate in the 1996 presidential election. Hau rejoined the KMT in 2005.

==Personal life==
He married Kuo Wan-hua and had two sons and three daughters. One of his sons is politician Hau Lung-pin, the former chairman of the New Party, and former Mayor of Taipei. Kuo Wan-hua died on 12 September 2018, aged 96. Hau was baptized as a Christian on 31 December 2017.

Hau Pei-tsun died of multiple organ failure at Tri-Service General Hospital on 30 March 2020, aged 100. He was posthumously awarded a presidential citation.

<doc id="333668" wikidata="Q6634083" url="?curid=333668" title="List of poetry collections">
<text>A poetry collection is often a compilation of several poems by one poet to be published in a single volume or chapbook. A collection can include any number of poems, ranging from a few (e.g. the four long poems in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;) to several hundred poems (as is often seen in collections of haiku). Typically the poems included in single volume of poetry, or a cycle of poems, are linked by their style or thematic material. Most poets publish several volumes of poetry through the course of their life while other poets publish one (e.g. Walt Whitman&#x27;s lifelong expansion of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;).

The notion of a &quot;collection&quot; differs in definition from volumes of a poet&#x27;s &quot;collected poems&quot;, &quot;selected poems&quot; or from a poetry anthology. Typically, a volume entitled &quot;Collected Poems&quot; is a compilation by a poet or an editor of a poet&#x27;s work that is often both published and previously unpublished, drawn over a set span of years of the poet&#x27;s work, or the entire poet&#x27;s life, that represents a more complete or definitive edition of the poet&#x27;s work. Comparatively, a volume titled &quot;selected poems&quot; often includes a small but not definitive selection of poems by a poet or editor drawn from several of the poet&#x27;s collections. A poetry anthology differs in concept because it draws together works from multiple poets chosen by the anthology&#x27;s editor.

==By title in alphabetical order==
Because there is often confusion as to what constitutes a &quot;collection&quot;, the list below only includes single volumes of poetry that were published at the direction of the author as a stand-alone collection and not any compiled editions of &quot;collected works&quot; or &quot;selected works.&quot;

<doc id="333672" wikidata="Q1652799" url="?curid=333672" title="Video Recordings Act 1984">
<text>The Video Recordings Act 1984 (c. 39) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was passed in 1984. It states that commercial video recordings offered for sale or for hire within the UK must carry a classification that has been agreed upon by an authority designated by the Home Office. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), which had been instrumental in the certification of motion pictures since 1912, was designated as the classifying authority in 1985. Works are classified by the BBFC under an age-rated system (see motion picture rating systems); it is an offence under the Act to supply video works to individuals who are (or appear to be) under the age of the classification designated. Works that are refused classification cannot, under the Act, be legally sold or supplied to anyone of any age unless it is educational, or to do with a sport, religion or music and does not depict violence, sex or incite a criminal offence. The BBFC may also require cuts to be made, either to receive a certain age rating, or to be allowed a classification at all.

==History==

===Leadup===

The act was a legislative reaction to a moral panic concerning &quot;video nasties&quot; that was sparked by tabloid newspapers in Britain during 1982 and 1983.

===Early history and follow-ups===

Sport, music, religious, and educational works are exempt from classification under the Act. Exemption may be forfeited if the work depicts excessive human sexual activity or acts of force or restraint associated with such activity, mutilation or torture of humans or animals, human genital organs or urinary or excretory functions, or techniques likely to be useful in the perpetration of criminal acts or illicit activity.

The Act was accompanied by the Video Recordings (Labelling) Act 1985, which set out regulations governing the display of certificates awarded by the BBFC on published recordings.

The act was amended in the Video Recordings Act 1993 but underwent no significant changes. It was amended again in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to deal with the growing issue of &quot;video violence&quot;. In addition, the amendment extended the definition of a video recording to any device capable of storing electronic data, which invariably includes works available on DVD as well as CD and CD-ROM, although the amendment exempts video games (except if they depict criminal activity which is likely to any significant extent to stimulate or encourage the commission of offences). The current labelling regulations are The Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations 2012.

===Discovery of loophole and replacement===

In August 2009 it was discovered that the Act was unenforceable as the European Commission was not notified about it, as required by Directive 83/189 (see now Directive 98/34). Directive 83/189 had to be implemented by 31 March 1984 (12 months after its notification to the member states). Until this situation was rectified, it was legal to sell and supply unclassified videos and computer games, although many retailers had agreed to observe the regulations voluntarily. Then pending prosecutions under the Act were abandoned, but the government claimed that past convictions could not be challenged. The government&#x27;s view was upheld in 2010 when two appeals against earlier convictions were dismissed. 

In December 2009 the government introduced new legislation, the Video Recordings Act 2010, which repealed and immediately revived the Video Recordings Act 1984, after the required notification was provided to the European Commission in October 2009. This legislation, which was enacted under the &quot;fast-track&quot; procedure (and therefore was expedited through Parliament), made the 1984 Act enforceable once again, as well as allowing it to be amended by the Digital Economy Act 2010. In December 2014 streaming and on-demand services were brought under the remit of this act via the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014.

<doc id="333674" wikidata="Q855688" url="?curid=333674" title="2000 Summer Paralympics">
<text>The 2000 Summer Paralympic Games or the XI Summer Paralympics were held in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, between 18 and 29 October. The Sydney Paralympics was the last time that the Summer Paralympics were organized by two different Organizing Committees. In this edition, a record 3,801 athletes from 120 National Paralympic Committees participated in 551 events in 18 sports. The 2000 Summer Paralympics were the second largest sporting event ever until that date held in Australia and in the Southern Hemisphere. Sydney was the eighth city to jointly host the Olympic and Paralympic Games. However, it was only the fourth to jointly organize both events with the in complete conjunction with the Olympics. This edition was also the first time that the Paralympics were held in Australia and Oceania.

== Host city bid process ==

=== The last time the Olympics and Paralympics could go their separate ways ===
This was the last time to date that the Paralympics host city was chosen in a process that was not linked to the Olympic Games. Starting with the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, the IOC demanded that the applicants cities submitted their plans to host the Paralympic Games as a part of their Olympic proposals. As it was selected as host in different process, this was the last time in history that the Summer Olympics and Paralympics were organized by separate enties.However,diverses circumstances led to a series of common organizational decisions mediated by Olympic Coordination Authority, an institution created to mediate the common demands of the two organizationsand which resulted in an event of excellence organized without any type of historical precedent.

=== Different process, same results ===

Shortly after the huge success of the 1992 Summer Paralympic Games, held in Barcelona, the then International Sports Coordination Committee for Disabilities (ICC) was dissolved and from 1993 the International Paralympic Committee was responsible for managing and organizing the global parasports movement. And while the situation was going very well for Lillehammer as host of the 1994 Winter Paralympic Games, which would be the first to be fully managed by the IPC, the situation regarding Atlanta as host of the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games placed the newly created entity in a nebulous situation. Since until then it was not mandatory for cities that demonstrated their intentions related to the Olympic Games to demonstrate the same goodwill towards the Paralympic Games. Attempts at financial and institutional boycotts and judicialization of the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games in Atlanta forced the International Olympic Committee in 1993 to turn IPC as one of the stakeholders of the bidding process to host the Olympic Games host city starting in 1993.This inclusion placed IPC in a very prominent role in the process. However, it was only as a consultation body, as the two processes were carried out separately with each institution doing it in its own way. This is exemplified by what happened in the process that took the XI edition of the Summer Paralympic Games to Sydney, Australia.

As the IOC evaluations were progressively released, Sydney and Beijing were showing a certain favoritism, but to date, this had been the most disputed and undefined Olympic host selection process in history with all five remaining cities fully capable of receiving the Olympic Games.
But, as the IPC was carrying out its process separately, the Evaluation Committee decided to eliminate Istanbul and the winner would be chosen during the tenth session of its Executive Board meeting, held in Berlin, Germany the IPC evaluated in a independent process the candidatures of the five cities remaining in the selection process to host the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, with four (Beijing, Berlin, Manchester and Sydney) of the five finalist cities for the 2000 Summer Olympics had met the specific conditions to host the Paralympic Games. However, even with technical flaws, three of them (Beijing, Berlin and Manchester) offered to organize the Paralympics in a model very similar to that of Barcelona and Lillehammer in which the same Organizing Committee took over both events. This did not happen with Sydney, which initially did not demonstrate intentions related to the Paralympic Games, but throughout the process, its delegates observed that this could be a weakness in the Olympic bid. As this would be a very complicated process, the Olympic bid delegates decided to accept the Paralympic bid late. However, as Australian legislation at that time did not allow the two projects to merge, two separate Committees had to participate in the respective processes. However, this was not a problem for the two bids, as the SOBC (Sydney Olympic Bid Committee) provided several professionals for the assembly/execution of the SPBC (Sydney Paralympic Bidding Committee) in a very limited time. While there were technical uncertainties and other issues that weakened the other three bids, it was Sydney&#x27;s that, even though it was the simplest, stood out for its excellence in these issues putting Sydney as the only viable bid. Which made the delegates from the 94 National Paralympic Committees present unanimously decide that the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games would be held in Sydney.

Sydney wins the bidding process to for the XI Summer Paralympics on 11 September 1993.However, this decision had to be taken in secret, as in 12 days the IOC would make its final decision at a meeting held in Monaco. The IPC had to wait 4 days to officially announce that the Australian city had been chosen to protect itself from any decision other than the IPC and to begin new rounds of negotiations with the eventual winner if another city won the Olympic process. However, this was not necessary. Even with this facilitation and happy coincidence, the IPC would still have to wait a few months to sign the host city contract. If there was no progress, &quot;plan B&quot; would be activated and negotiations with Great Britain would begin immediately. The conditions for Sydney to host the Paralympic Games were stricter than those presented for Barcelona to host the 1992 Summer Paralympic Games and they involved certain clauses that would become controversial years later and all of them involved much more restricted and rigid financial issues and requirements, largely because of what happened in relation to Atlanta when the city was near to host the 1996 Games, with clear conditions given to Sydney that negotiations with Manchester would be initiated if the Australian stakeholders proved that they really had the guarantees and conditions to given a true financial security to the games, and these were fulfilled following several rounds of negotiations between the Federal Government of Australia and the Government of the State of New South Wales.

This was not the last time that the Olympics and Paralympics had different organizations. Five years later, When preparing to host the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, the city of Turin and its Organizing Committee had to spin off, for financial reasons, its Paralympic department into another institution that was financed by a public-private partnership that gave rise to ComParTo, but which nevertheless had all its sectors in common and worked together until the two were dissolved.

==Background to the bid process==
=== Context before the Games ===
United States and Australia are very traditional countries in the Paralympic movement,always actively participating in the international Paralympic movement since its early days.Despite this, these historical characteristics did not help to raise awareness among local authorities when civil society movements in both understood during the late 1980s and early 1990s that the Olympic and Paralympic Movements were already going hand in hand and its two main events could no longer be held separately and despite the acceptance of their local societies, the Paralympics were seen as a second-class event or something of potential financial loss. While the organization of the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games was almost a &quot;perfect storm&quot;, due to various administrative and financial issues as a result of the existence of two separate Organizing Committees that were always in conflict, result of several disagreements since the beginning of the Olympic bid in 1987.When Atlanta developed our Olympic project in a example of excellence. However, this did not open the door to any type of flexibility or any extra expenses due to the option of a 100% private financing model very similar to what Los Angeles had done during the organization of the 1984 Summer Olympics which put her ahead of all other competitors for the 1996 Summer Olympics.Although the IOC sees this as a gigantic and safe advantage, the possibilities for any other event scheduled for the city in 1996 and thisand this put the Paralympics on this &quot;black list&quot;.
When Sydney won the internal process of the Australian Olympic Committee held in 1990,there were serious proposals for this model to be repeated.But,there&#x27;s a huge public interest from all spaces, given the need to build public spaces and accelerate a re-urbanization process of the city.As the project progressed,the higher interest began to gather new groups, increasingly reaching a larger space, reaching all levels of government resulting in a project funded by 3 interested parties (federal government, city and private investitures) financing 33% of the Games budget. 

=== History of the Paralympic Movement in Australia ===
Despite having a historical tradition in the Paralympics and having participated (and won gold medals) in the previous eight summer editions, Australia had traditionally looked down or had little interest on Paralympic sport, to the point that during the 2000 Summer Olympics host city bid process. After won the Australian internal process, Sydney had showed little or no interest in hosting the Paralympics and had not submitted any proposal about hosting the event. As the Olympic bid process progressed and Sydney positioned itself as the favorite, the lack of interest in the Paralympics began to be seen as a weakness in relation to Manchester and Berlin, which propose a management and organization model similar to that was used in Barcelona.Along Australia,Germany and Great Britain are traditional countries in the Olympic and Paralympic movement. However,between 1989 to 1993,the europeans had much greater strength and reputation than Australia. Between 1960 to 1992, was normal on local media that the accomplishments and performances of local athletes were little noticed or ignored. Not even expressive results, such as fifth place in the medal table at the 1992 Summer Paralympics and the expressive second place in 1996, drew in a small attention that the Paralympic sport deserved and was treated in other countries and some sectors of society stayed give the same treat and conceptions that the Paralympics &quot;were an event of second class&quot;.

===The impact of Barcelona and Atlanta at the bids for the 2000 Games===

*&quot;See also&quot;: 1984 Summer Olympics, 1996 Summer Olympics, 1996 Summer Paralympics.

If the joint management of the 1992 Summer Paralympics opened up new possibilities for the Paralympic Games, the confusion and discredit surrounding the 1996 Games could cause enormous damage to the image of the Paralympics. As the events in Atlanta they had no relation, and were planned to held with two separate Organizing Committees, functioning simultaneously and without any communication and inexistent relations. Even Nagano, which would host the 1998 Winter Paralympics, was further ahead than Atlanta and provided more security for the International Paralympic Committee, that despite having two separate organizations, the stakeholders were the same.

After the financial success of the 1984 Summer Olympics, &quot;Olympic Fever&quot; swept the United States, and their bids became common in the following years. Anchorage, Alaska applied to host the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics without success, and Salt Lake City also applied for the 1998 Winter Olympics, before the Utah capital &quot;bought&quot; the bidding process and won the rights to host the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995: three years later, the ensuing bribery scandal became public, leading to the biggest crisis in the history of the Olympic movement until the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed. Considered short-term bids, both Atlanta and Salt Lake City had used as a guide the financing model of the 1984 Summer Olympics, when no public funds were invested in the organization of the Games. Unlike Sydney, all the competition venues were ready and were mostly from private institutions. During the bid, all sponsors and interested parties financed all the necessary works.

By choosing this model, however, the Atlanta Olympic Bid Committee, caused the Paralympic Games to be &quot;forgotten&quot;, as seen from the loss of funding and low market potential, closing the door to any kind of damage to the image of the AOCOG. However, when this situation was discovered, this led to a severe public outcry. As Salt Lake City was already in the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee changed the process and signed a strategic partnership with the International Paralympic Committee in 1994, making the compromise to host the Paralympics under the same umbrella and Organizing Committee.

===Two committees, too much confusion===

Initially, the fact was raised that ACOG had purposely forgotten about the Paralympics, and the reasons became clear: the event lacked the potential economic returns, visibility and appeal of the Olympics. After this led to a civil movement led by the Shepherd Center, it became possible that the 1996 Summer Paralympics would be held in Great Britain, with an unknown city having already signed a pre-contract as a reserve if Atlanta chose not to, or was unable to, host the Paralympic Games.

The Shepherd Center&#x27;s effort worked despite pressure from the USOC and its sponsors, who thought the Paralympics were taking advantage of the Olympics, and also forced a boycott from them: to that end, major local companies had threatened to withdraw funding to the event.

Despite all this, the Atlanta experience turned out to be disastrous for everyone involved, with all the money raised being used to outsource the essential services at the venues to the ACOG.

===The Olympic bidding process===
While all this confusion was going on, the process of choosing the host city for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games was already open, and eight National Olympic Committees showed their initial intentions to participate in the process: Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Turkey and Uzbekistan, with six of them also showing interest in hosting the Paralympics, having &quot;open arms and hearts&quot; to the Paralympics in their bidding documents.

Throughout the process, and for several reasons, Brazil, Italy and Uzbekistan withdrew, with the other five bids being automatic finalists. When publishing this list, the IPC evaluated these candidates in parallel and announced that Turkey did not satisfy the conditions to host the Paralympic Games. However, the remaining four still faced different technical and feasibility requirements.

====Sydney&#x27;s reluctance to host the Paralympics====

The Sydney 2000 Olympic Bidding Committee (SOBC) was initially not concerned with the Paralympic Games, and with several plausible arguments from the Australians:

* Firstly, the risk of costs related to an eventual victory at the respective process to host the Olympic Games and two weeks later, the Paralympic Games.
* Secondly, the city and the country did not have the practical conditions to host two events of the same size in such a short time.
* Thirdly, concerns that the same situation was happening in Atlanta, when the city hosted the two events, but with two completely different organizing committees that did not communicate with each other and turned both into disasters for all parties involved.

The low cooperation between the 1996 Summer Olympics Organizing Committee and its Paralympic counterpart also spilled over into the logistical and financial aspects. In Atlanta, several competition venues were more than 50 km from the Olympic Village and hotels and were outside the Olympic Ring, within universities that did not host any events at the Olympic Games.

Several forecasts by experts at the time said that this organizational model would not work, which was proven during the Games, particularly in the areas of logistics, ticket sales and marketing.

Confusion also reached in terms of financial support, even in the sale of corporate sponsorship quotas, while the Games suffered a boycott and numerous lawsuits filed by both the USOC and by the Olympic sponsors who alleged misuse of trademarks.

This alienation of sponsors forced the Organizing Committee of the Olympics to buy a small part of its counterpart for US$5 million, and to oblige the Paralympic Committee not to contract sponsorship quotas from competitors - who were the Olympic sponsors - which was judicially proven the differences between the events.

Things significantly improved after the International Olympic Committee intervened and also bought a sponsorship share, as the remaining quotas of corporate sponsorship were bought by multinationals which had their world headquarters in the city (i.e. Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and The Home Depot).

After the diabolical situation that the Atlanta Paralympic Committee was in became public, the IOC changed the rules to prevent a repeat: starting with the bid process for the 2002 Winter Olympics host city, it was required that each city interested in participating in the hosting process for the Olympic Games commit to publicizing its plans for the Paralympic Games, as the 1992 Summer Paralympics had been a success without precedence.

After extensive marketing research, those responsible for Sydney&#x27;s bid also considered the fact that the reach of the Paralympic Games were small and limited, given the local public were not likely to receive the event positively. As there was no obligation at the time to also host the Paralympic Games, Sydney would only consider applying for the simultaneous organization of the two events if it won the Olympic bid.

This possibility did not interest the newly created Australian Paralympic Federation (APF), led by former athlete Ron Finneran, who was delighted with what had happened in recent editions of the Paralympic Games, where the same cities were hosting the Olympic Games. At the same time, the Atlanta Paralympics situation could help the rising importance and knowledge of the Paralympíc Movement around the world.

The Bid Committee did not trust the APF to the same level as the organizational capabilities of the IPC, because of the short time it had been in operation, the lack of administrative and financial experience, the lack of experience and structure, and because of what was going on in Atlanta.

The financial difficulties encountered by Atlanta had repercussions since the beginning of Sydney&#x27;s plans: the APC was small, but had money to survive from its members and the Australian Government, though this would not be able to raise sufficient resources to promote the bid during 1992 and 1993.

Some time after this situation was resolved, new questions regarding the reliability of the APF were raised by Australian public opinion. There were so many doubts and uncertainties that TV networks in the country had no potential interest in broadcasting promotional videos or involvement in marketing functions.

At the same time, the Bid Committee was asked about sources of funding for the event, since the Paralympics did not have the market appeal of the Olympic Games and also, how the APF would be able to get other sources of private funding.

===The beginning of the dream===
With the successful integration in Barcelona, where the two events were marketed as a &quot;60-day sporting celebration&quot;, the first contacts between the APF and the Sydney 2000 Bid Committee (SOBC) were made in 1991 and again in the first half of 1992.

However, like all previous Olympics host cities, the SOBC had no plans to bid for the Paralympics unless Sydney won the Olympic counterpart. The lack of knowledge of local legislation also hindered the planning of the APF.

Under Australian law, the SOBC was constituted as a &quot;specific purpose entity&quot;, which barred any change in its composition. The SOBC operated as a joint venture company with a 100% of its composition divided into three equal parts: 33.3% owned by the Australian Olympic Committee, 33.3% owned by the Government of New South Wales and 33.3% owned by the Commonwealth of Australia.

Under the current Australian legislation at the time, regardless of winning or losing the candidacy, at the end of the process it would have to be dissolved. Thus, these rules blocked any change in the composition, structure and functioning of the SOBC. As a result of this, the bid committee created by the APF had to do all the work alone.

After the announcement that of the five finalists, four satisfied the conditions to host the Paralympic Games (Beijing, Berlin, Manchester and Sydney) – technical infeasibility eliminated Istanbul – the IPC breathed a sigh of relief at that moment as three of these cities were proposing to &quot;jointly organize the Olympic and Paralympic Games to save human and financial resources&quot;: the only bidding city that didn&#x27;t propose this was Sydney.

After the decision was made by the IOC, Berlin was seen as favorites, as it was &quot;considered the perfect proposal to celebrate the entry of the third millennium&quot; as they wanted to celebrate the ten years of the German reunification and the Games were seen a perfect opportunity. But the support of its bid was marred after anti-Olympic protesters marched through the city just four days before the final voting in Monaco, claiming that the Games would be using funds to further domestic reconstruction efforts.

The Manchester&#x27;s bid book was believed to be one of the most strong, but was harmed by recurring delays in the regeneration process and the ongoing works at the historic centre of the city, by criticism within Britain when its promotional videos and material featured videos and photos of the main tourist attractions London city, such as Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge, instead of Manchester&#x27;s tourist attractions.

The first reactions in the UK were one of disbelief and embarrassment when the final presentation was taken in Monaco: many opinions in the editorials in national and local newspapers the following day concluded &quot;Manchester is in a severe identity crisis&quot;, and even with Great Britain being the &quot;spiritual home of Paralympic sport&quot;, Manchester&#x27;s candidacy was being rejected by political force, along with several failures - the most glaring being their proposal to hold the Paralympic Games over 15 days, whereas the maximum allowed at the time was 12.

A review of the failed project in a smaller scale was submitted two years later to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), and the city was eventually named as the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

Along Berlin, the city was seen as a favourite due to the bid book stating &quot;The Paralympic Games will be jointly financed with the Olympic Games and athletes will have the same opportunities and conditions offered to their Olympic counterparts&quot;.

Beijing had very weak arguments, similar to those of Milan (who withdrew in February 1993 due to a scandal involving overpricing for the project and involving environmental risks related to the Po River), though Beijing stated that &quot;the city would accept the mission of organizing and hosting the Paralympic Games, and that the financing would be the same&quot;.

However, the entire project would be developed jointly between BOBICO and the IPC, respecting all international rules and legislation. Despite this, the Chinese bid was still frowned upon because of issues relating to the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, along with weak legislation related to the disabled and accessibility in public places.

With all these problems seeing the other candidates eliminated, only the APF candidacy remained, which also faced serious problems: despite being the only viable candidate, the risks were still present, as there were no financial and structural guarantees for the project.

During the first phase of feasibility studies, the Sydney 2000 Olympic Bid Committee (SOBC) had rejected the holding of the Paralympics, haunted by the perfect storm that was brewing in Atlanta. That made perfect sense, because after so many conflicts both events would happen, but being organized by two totally different and disconnected organizations.

Since from the beginning, the Organizing Committee of the 1996 Summer Olympics ignored any possibility of helping the organization of the Paralympic Games, the IPC had to consider a &quot;plan B&quot;, which would be to hold the games in Great Britain or maintain them in Spain. However, the efforts of civil society in the city of Atlanta led to the main managers of the world know-Shepherd Center, to hold the project in a record three years&#x27; time. But unlike Seoul and Barcelona, there were financial and budget uncertainties which were only resolved at the last minute when large companies and multinationals based in the city bought the sponsorship when attempts to boycott and sabotage by Olympics and United States Olympic Committee sponsors become public through complaints made by the Paralympic organizers themselves.

===The Sydney affair===

Sydney did not originally submit any documents regarding the holding of the Paralympic Games, which angered the Paralympics Australia, as the funding for the Olympics was secured: it seemed there was no realistic prospect of any funding for the Paralympics.

A few days later, when the application documents were released and the applications were accepted, it was reported that all cities except Sydney had given guarantees to host the Paralympics. Berlin and Manchester were still committed to financing and organizing the Paralympic Games with the same Organizing Committee and joint investment.

This triggered a red light for the SOBC: the bid planning needed to be redone, and a chapter on the Paralympic Games was included at the last minute.

However, it was clear that the two events would be organized by two separate Organizing Committees. Immediately, the bid consultants advised the SOBC to reconsider its decision, and reluctantly they accepted this: it was claimed that the &quot;rejection of the Paralympic Games could be considered a crucial weakness for Sydney&quot; and that &quot;important votes for the end could be lost&quot;.

Against its will, the SOBC approached the APF and tried to change its statute and the entire project to include the plans for the Paralympic Games, but the legislation in force in Australia at that time barred this structural change.

While the possibility of what was happening in Atlanta could repeat were real, the Australian Paralympic athletes and managers resilience was what kept their hopes alive.

===Third phase: the fight continues===
While the period of presentations was approaching, SPBC was structured. With a simpler and more modest structure than the other candidates as consequences of the lack of financial, organizational and structural support. As the final evaluations approached, the Sydney bidding committee for the 2000 Summer Paralympics was structured in a simpler and more modest way than the other bidders as a consequence of it being operating separately and also because there was not the structural, financial and organizational support of the Olympic Committee. Despite being there competing, Sydney&#x27;s candidacy had more work than her competitors because of this lack of support.

===The APF&#x27;s resilience===
The APF presented throughout the process a surprising level of articulation, willpower and organization for an institution that had only been in operation for two and half years. In its first months of operation, the APF formally assumed the functions of the Bid Committee for the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games (SBPG).

After the Australian Confederation of Sports for the Disabled (ACSD) ceased operations on 31 December 1989, the APF had the same functions and attributions that today belong to the Australian Paralympic Committee (APC).

In addition to these roles, they took on the duties and the matters of Sydney&#x27;s bid for the 2000 Summer Paralympics. The APF also had the tasks of organizing its staff and interested parties, convincing sceptics about Australia&#x27;s ability to host, organize and manage the Paralympic Games after the Olympics (hosted at a level of excellence never before seen), and show that a potential Paralympic edition on Australian soil could be a perfect opportunity to demonstrate that parathletes are part of Australian society, and that they have enormous potential to demonstrate their inclusion and diversity.

The APC&#x27;s arguments had previously been used successfully when they convinced former Prime Minister Bob Hawke to sponsor the foundation of the APF: nobody imagined that Australia would consolidate itself in the Paralympic movement in the same way as in the Olympic movement, or even that this would be done in just six years. As a courtesy from the NSW Government, APC would gain an office at the New South Wales Sport House.

===Third phase: &quot;We are on this&quot;===
The activities and the work of the Bid Committee gained greater intensity as 1992 drew to a close: the APC would have to present its project to external and interested parties.

At the same time that the engagement and involvement of the population in the Olympic bid increased, the rejection of the Paralympics grew in the same way. For many, the work of the APF was considered &quot;opportunistic&quot; and &quot;rude&quot;, while others understood that there was an &quot;obligation for pity&quot;. With this negativity growing, the APF continued to do its job, while the difficulties continued to increase every day.

Taking advantage of this and the increasingly shorter deadline for sending the necessary documentation - this was to be delivered to the IPC by 21 March 1993.

The late Adrienne Smith, who was then working as the executive secretary of the APC, sat down at a table with several consultants of the SOBC: in just eight weeks, Smith and the SOBC drew up the bid project that would be handed over to the IPC executive board in a meeting scheduled for Lillehammer, Norway. In a surprise action, the APF managed to add the letters of intent signed by the prime minister, the governor of NSW, and the mayor of Sydney.

At this meeting, the four candidate cities were aware of what their competitors were proposing to the IPC and, for the first time, face-to-face meetings between the members of these candidacy committees took place.

Some of the Australian journalists who were accompanying the Sydney delegation reported that &quot;the APF Committee made a functional and realistic presentation, but which in comparison was much simpler and more modest than the others&quot;. As a sign of courtesy, approach and recognition, the SOBC paid the expenses for the trip to Norway and integrated the delegation and its executive manager, though the SBPC was responsible for printing all its promotional material, the necessary documentation and the application book (which were scarce compared to that of other cities).

Same sources that reported that the other three candidates &quot;were very well represented&quot; and all had &quot;convincing and more strong arguments&quot;: a member of the Australian delegation even declared that &quot;if we had a small team, all the work would be more difficult to do&quot;, scolding the local society by declaring that &quot;there was an implicit lack of respect for the importance of the event, as it equated to the choice of the Olympic host city&quot;.

During the Lillehammer presentation, it was announced that the first estimated budget for the Paralympic Games was expected to be more than AU$84 million and this would be financed by the sale of sponsorship quotas, tickets, licensed products, marketing actions, and contributions from the Governments of New South Wales and Australia. It was not reported at the time how much was intended to be gained from the sale of media rights.

===1993: almost everything collapses===

1993 was the most important year for the ambitions of SOBC and SBPC: January could not have started better, as the APF was able to confirm that it had obtained the formal and official support of the governmental spheres involved.

A few days before the trip to Norway, the Federal Minister of Sports of Australia, Ros Kelly, confirmed that formal and official support from the SOBC was ratified and they would be partners for whatever the APC needed. Kelly also confirmed that letters of intent were being sent by these government levels.

It seemed that with this public support, everything would be solved. But after several denials, the most worrying issues would resurface: even with all the accepted and well-structured arguments, the APF still had not obtained the financial guarantees and it was feared that any request for financial assistance would be seen as a provocation.

Since at that time, the APF was not in a position to support itself financially - nor would its members be able to raise funds and finance all the costs of the bid and the Games itself - if Sydney was the winner.

The concern was valid because the choice of the Paralympics host would be before the Olympic host, and any eventual failure it could spill over into the Olympic candidacy. Further to this, there were studies that reported that the Paralympic Games had &quot;low marketing potential&quot; and did not have &quot;the same commercial attraction as the Olympic Games&quot;.

In this letter there was relevant information that &quot;in the first months, the SOBC had guided the APF to look for other forms of financing that were not public&quot; and &quot;we cannot finance you in any way&quot;. This thinking was gradually changing, and the SOBC became ready some time later to help the SPBC in whatever it needed. The SOBC had even guided the APF to look for other sources of income for its candidacy.

This statement came at the same time that the APF admitted that it did not even have the capacity to pay the US$50,000 if Sydney did win the hosting rights.

After becoming aware of this dire situation, Finneran sent a letter informing the minister that their recent studies determined that the costs to host the Paralympic Games would be AU$82.67 million, of which the SOBC would provide AU$15 million from the ticket sales. The sales of sponsorship, tickets, related events such as fundraising and licensed products were expected to generate another AU$14.49 million, leaving a deficit of AU$53.18 million.

Finnegan raised an even more urgent situation, the difficulty of carrying out a separate marketing campaigns for the two events, as required by the SOBC and the IOC itself, and announced a joint campaign by the two bids, understanding that the function would be to maximize opportunities to acquire unified actions as same sponsors as well as private sector funding.

However, the dice had already been rolled and the main challenge now was the candidacy itself, and the city&#x27;s preparation for the IPC inspection visits that were scheduled for May and June of that year, as it had already been announced that the city&#x27;s bid proposal had been accepted. As per the rules of the final process, the final report would be released and the members of APF would have to make a final presentation before the then 94 National Paralympic Committees members of the IPC in Berlin, Germany, on 12 September 1993.

This selection was made eleven days before the 101st Session of the International Olympic Committee that was to be held in Monte Carlo, Monaco. However, the signing of the city contract would have to wait, as this depended on the decision of the Olympic host: on 23 September, Sydney won the hosting rights in an upset, beating the favorite, Beijing, by just two votes. Thus, for the eighth time in history, the same city would host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the same year: the SOBC had chosen 16 September – 1 October to hold the Olympic Games, while the APF chose 14–26 October to hold the Paralympic Games.

After the win, Smith – now executive manager of the SPBC – commented that &quot;we couldn&#x27;t go public because if we did it would have ruined the Olympic bid. We had no acknowledgement of financial support from the government until the day of the bid in September 1993.&quot;

Between these actions, Smith, Finneran, and members of SOBC also ensured in a letter to the IOC, IPC and Australian and New South Wales authorities that if Sydney won both bids, the Paralympic athletes would have the same treatment, conditions and support as their Olympic counterparts as happened in Barcelona, but in a better and innovative way. This was unprecedented and would become a turning point for the Paralympic Games.

=== After the elections: first innovative proposal ===
A few days after taking office, on 19 April 1993, Finneran wrote a new letter to the Minister explaining that either the APF or the Australian disability sports community were unable to accept responsibility for the financial contributions or otherwise for organizing the Games, even if they are submitting a bid. In the same letter, he further proposed that al the organization and the marketing of the Olympic and Paralympic Games was done under a same banner and this would be the best solution to ensure a successful delivery of the 2000 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.

At the first days of May 1993, a small Committee was organized by the APF and during the first meetings, a document described as a &quot;white paper&quot; was written. This document had the function of guiding all the actions that would be taken from there in the Australian bid. Another main objective was also to base its clear foundations with the government and consolidate the bid arguments during the hard process. After the ending of those meetings, Finneran sent the White Paper to his board on 12 May 1993, drawing attention with the following written statement made at the beginning message &quot;this white paper … clearly states to all directors involved, the position of the Australian Paralympic Federation and therefore the position of the Paralympic Bidding Committee (SPBC) in relation to the conditions under which the Paralympic Games will be held if Sydney wins the bid.&quot;

Even with the victory on two fronts, new rounds of negotiations,the amount of uncertainty and lack of guarantees was so great that new rounds of negotiations needed to be carried out, reaching the point that in 1995, when legislation surrounding the Games had to be approved in the Australian parliament, the Sydney Paralympic Games Organizing Committee (SPOC) reaching the point that in 1995, when legislation surrounding the Games needed to be approved in the Australian parliament, the Sydney Paralympic Games Organizing Committee was created within the structure of SOCOG.

== Costs ==
The Sydney 2000 Paralympic Bidding Committee (SPBC) outlined that a budget of AU$84 million (near AU$188 million in 2022) would be required to stage the games, largely coming from revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship quotas, licensed products, charities and marketing, with smaller contributions expected from the federal and New South Wales state governments. The initial budget had not forecast possible income relating to the sale of media rights to the games. Market research at the time indicated that the Paralympic Games had &quot;little potential&quot; compared to its Olympic counterpart and it was &quot;uncertain and risky to invest in an event with no certain return&quot;, making the games a difficult sell to potential sponsors.

In 1993, the head of the Australian Paralympic Federation (APF) Ron Finneran presented the Federal Government with a revised budget of AU$82.67 million (AUD $185.48 million in 2023). Of this, the SOBC were prepared to commit $15 million, with a further $14.49 million expected from ticket sales, quotas and sponsorship partnerships and other actions, leaving a budget shortfall of AU$58.33 million. On 1 October 1993, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that AU$65 million (AU$145.83 million in 2023) had been allocated for the budget of the Sydney Paralympic Games. Around AU$40 million (AU$100.96 million) was committed from the New South Wales Government, after the state Premier committed to recover more than 50% of the money from other budget sources. The Federal Government allocated another AU$25 million (AU$56.06 million).

The final estimates for the games came to AU$157 million (AU$325.25 million in 2023), with the NSW Government and Commonwealth Government contributing AU$25 million each (AU$56.09 million in 2023 values). The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) contributed AU$18 million (AU$40.38 million in 2023 values), within the bid estimates. The Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC) signed the host city contract with the recently formed International Paralympic Committee in 1993, a few days after the city had been chosen to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. This contract outlined the SPOC&#x27;s obligations in hosting the Paralympic Games. To cover the remaining costs, revenue was raised via sponsorships quotas shared with SOCOG and ticket sales. The 110,000-seat Stadium Australia was completed three months early in February 1999, this stadium was funded mainly by the private sector at an estimated cost of AU$690 million (AU$1.548.090.000 in 2023 values), the Government contributed AU$124 million (AU$278.210 million in 2023) to this project. Though there was no budgeted profit, repayments to the State and Federal Governments were prioritised in the event of profit being made. In October 1998, governing bodies of the Olympics and Paralympics initiated a joint call for volunteers. An estimated total of forty-one thousand Australians answered this call, non-including those sourced from specialist community groups.

==Environment==
In an innovative way, the Olympic and Paralympic project had as the major focus, the completion of the first stage of the Millennium Parklands. This is composed of 450 hectares of landscape, with up to 40 kilometres of pedestrian and cycle trails. This major first stage included focus on the surrounding Olympic and Paralympic facilities, providing a beautiful landscape for recreational activities, conservation and environmental education/preservation. During this time work on the Water Reclamation and Management Scheme (WRAMS) will continue to progress. The WRAMS will be in use during the games with the first stage (recycled water to be used for flushing and irrigation) to be implemented. This system will continue after the games, and will be fully developed after the games has been completed. The WRAMS system is only one of the many water saving management strategies to be used during the games period. Plans to use stormwater runoff from Newington to be used as irrigation and a requirement for Olympic venues to utilise water saving techniques and devices are also some of the other water saving plans. Stormwater from the Stadium Australia roof is to be collected and used to irrigate the central stadium. An environmental education program is also delivered throughout 1999–2000 to ensure that Homebush Bay and the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympics continues to be recognised for their commitment to the environment after their end.

==Administration==
As the host city contract signed in September 1993, the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games were governed and overseen by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), led by them-President Robert Steadward. The Games were organised by the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC) led by President Dr John Grant and chief executive officer Lois Appleby. The Sydney 2000 Summer Olympic Games Organizing Committee (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Games Organizing Committee (SPOC) were established on November 12, 1993, by the same creation act. Even though it had a different history, SPOC was absorbed as a subsidiary of SOCOG but with a bigger autonomy with separate budget forecasts and subsidies. In its first year of operation SOCOG and SPOC actions were carried out independently.
However, during 1994, the authorities realized that both had several characteristics in common and motivated by incidents prior to the organization of the Atlanta Games, it was decided in the second half of that year to merge both organizations.in a movement mediated by the Australian government. This form was born in January 1995, the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) was born. A body created by the city&#x27;s three spheres of government to mediate relations between all parties involved. After the fusion, SPOC and SOCOG became two different public companies controlled by the Sydney local Government, receiving support by both State and Commonwealth Governments. Despite being legally different apart the same structure, the composition of the boards of directors of the two Committees was practically made up of the same people with the same functions with members appointed by New South Wales Premier, the Federal and State Ministers for the Olympics, the Federal Treasurer and the Federal and State Ministers for Sports and Recreation who conducted the joint planning. Within OCA, SOCOG and SPOC had the same administrative and legal duties and responsibilities related to the management, planning and execution of the Games. But SPOC responsibilities included almost all their relative marketing actions, the sale and distribution of tickets, the information systems and services, the disability classification, the converting Olympic venues to Paralympics, conducting the test events, facilitating drug testing, arranging broadcasting conditions, the housing for athletes, arranging all the ceremonies, transporting athletes and conducting and take the Paralympic Torch Relay. Along the IPC, the SPOC also had the responsibilities to regulate the use of Paralympic Games brand and images.

After the merger of the two entities, the OCA realized that the two Organizing Committees had actions and problems in common. But, while the organizers of the Olympics had more experience due to being involved with previous editions, those of the Paralympics had much greater difficulties, due to several factors. The OCA decided that it would be better to mediate the potential conflicts that would occur, creating a Joint Risk Management Committee for those areas in common between the two events, who started to work in June 1997. On 29 November of the same the Sydney 2000 Games Administration was passed at the parliament. This specific legislative act forced the dissolution of the SOCOG and SPOC from 1 January 2001, and their assets and liabilities were transferred to the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) who was the from that moment on, she became responsible for managing the legacy of both events.

Even with this innovative organizational measure, there was a need for the IPC to intervene in small elements and moments, as the aaus such as the separation of theEven with the extensive experience of the people involved in the organization, the IPC realized that there were some specific needs, such as the creation of a specific sports and competitions department for the Paralympic Games. Thus, in 1997, the Spaniard Xavier Gonzalez was appointed to the portfolio, who had performed the same role in the two previous summer editions. The Gonzalez department supervised more than 3 thousand athletes in 21 competition venues including the supplementary and auxiliary places involving all sports management and competitions under your orientation. This subdivision was also responsible for finalizing the sporting program and make the final calendar.

==Educational program==
As part of the Educational Program, developed with all spheres of government and civil society, a multitude of monitoring and participation programs were developed with a view to helping the Games organization raise the AU$20 million that was needed for the Games account to be closed.

=== &quot;Set No Limits&quot; kits ===
The first educational initiative started in July 1998, SPOC distributed 10,000 free information resource kits to public and private schools and also to universities and libraries across Australia an educational material called &quot;Set No Limits&quot;. Designed to raise awareness and build anticipation of the Paralympic Games among students through a series of playing and learning activities based on the Paralympic sport and a collective healthy lifestyle. In this material there were also several questions related to the performance of para-athletes and what motivated them to practice the sport. Together with the function of encouraging the participation of young people in order to spark their curiosity so that they would assist them during the preparation period. This series of guides and proposed activities were developed by teachers, educators and Paralympic athletes such as the wheelchair basketball player Liesl Tesch. The &quot;Set No Limits&quot; was a multidisciplinary project and included technical sheets, videos, spreadsheets and other lot of class and work materials, activity proposals for physical education classes and official posters. The exercises and activities were all related to the athletes&#x27; personal life stories, health and quality of life issues and also specific focus at the venues on Sydney Olympic Park and had Lizzie, the Games mascot also a protagonist. Mainly aimed at students aged 8 to 15, the kit helps young Australians value and respect the commitment and performance of elite athletes with disabilities and encourages them to attend the Paralympic Games to see the athletes compete.

=== LEAP (Link Elite Athletes Program) ===
When a school finished all the stages from the &quot;Set No Limits&quot;, the institution was invited to be part of LEAP (Link Elite Athletes Program). Schools interested in being part of LEAP received a series of documents that had to be sent to the SPOC education department confirming their intentions to participate. In these documents, the institution was consulted about their characteristics and what type of athlete they wanted to be chosen to carry out the project. Exchanges between schools and athletes took place three times a year between 1998 and 2000 and they collected letters, faxes, cards, emails, drawings and photographs as they learned from each other realities. If this athlete lived or trained less than 200 km from the school where he was communicating, he could, in one of these opportunities, adopt the school and, visit the students in person in special events or during the school year. The students learned about the lifestyle, routine and specificities of each athlete with their training schedules and training methods. They also shared their experiences and dreams in view of the Paralympic Games. The exchange also allowed students to break down ideas and paradigms about what is necessary to be a Paralympian the standards so that each athlete can qualify for the Paralympic Games, together with the understanding of what &quot;disability is&quot; and what sport is Paralympic or adapted and how it is practiced.

The original goals of the LEAP program were to reach more than 1000 schools by April 2000, with 60 of them in a special category.Because they were &quot;schools that are more than 3000km from Sydney&quot;. SPOC aimed to attract more than 2,500 schools as members and encourage more than 170,000 students to be at the Olympic Park during the 12-day Games, a goal that was made easier with the introduction of a specific grant from the Australian Federal Government, which helped schools that were more than 200 km or more away from Sydney Olympic Park.

This donation of AU$1.3 million was specifically for those schools that were within the LEAP program.
Those schools beyond 200 km of Sydney Olympic Park that participate in the Paralympic Games received AU$10 per student; Those who were ‘beyond 400km’ category received AU$20; Those in the ‘beyond 1000km’ category received AU$40; Those who were more than 2,000 km away or in Tasmania received AU$100 and those who are more than 3,000 km away received AU$200.

Schools could also take advantage of the Day Pass system, which was adapted from large resorts and theme parks and could choose which sports or events could be attended. The value of the Day Pass was AU$15 per person and each student paid half, which was AU$8.As an incentive for their participation, schools that completed the LEAP program had access to advance purchase of daily passes and had a different condition for purchasing them. For every 100 passes sold, each school received another 10 free passes as a bonus. the federal government and SPOC encouraged schools to use these bonus passes for parents, teachers or coordination assistants to accompany their students to the Games. Children under five do not pay for any type of day pass and they were admitted with any type of fee.

&quot;As many Australian children as possible should witness the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games — our athletes are among the best in the world. Our children should be encouraged to experience first hand the triumph of our athletes who overcome their disabilities to excel.&quot; The Federal Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly upon announcing the LEAP Subsidy.

Given the gigantic success of LEAP, the Organizing Committee decided to reward those schools with the greatest engagement in the program, selecting around 900 students from 120 schools that were taking part in the program to assist authorities and security forces during the award ceremonies by loading trays with bouquets of flowers and medals.The students should be among the Year Five and the Year Six in 2000 and be between the ages of 10 and 12.

On February 29, 2000, SPOC announced that the number of schools involved in LEAP exceeded more than 2000 institutions involved in all Australian states and territories.Applications for the LEAP scholarship ended on April 30, 2000 and had no cost for the schools involved and covered all types of primary and secondary school institutions.By that date, approximately 272 LEAP participating schools in 5 states had purchased approximately 80,000 Day Passes..

===Paralympic Voice ===
As part of the educational program,the SPOC also developed a program of lectures and face-to-face actions called Paralympic Voice,which had several similarities to LEAP. But now it was developed with companies, commercial and community associations and other types of institutions.In this case, in addition to the possibility of communications and exchange of previous experiences, Paralympic athletes and other partners could visit these institutions in person through lectures and other institutional events when available..

==Public reception==
The incidents that happened before Atlanta forced Australian organizers to rethink the way in which the Paralympic Games would be promoted.and this involved work related to local communities and across the country. A big novelty was the development of a marketing campaign in which the issue of disability was abandoned and there was a focus on the trajectory of each athlete.and this ended up resulting in something unprecedented, as around more than 1 million people were present in the Olympic Park during the Games, namely some 340,000 basic education students. Public and private schools were provided with free day tickets for students and teachers to attend, as a conclusion for the schools education project which ran before the games.This was also results of the envolviment from a diverse range of areas and groups from the third sector. 

=== Volunteers ===
As they were jointly managing several areas, SOCOG and SPOC were also responsible for joint management of the volunteer program resulting in a total number of more than 62.000 volunteers who were divided between the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games themselves. 

Training for this gigantisc number of the volunteers, contractors and headquarters staff working during the Olympic and Paralympic Games was tottaly integrated and involved specific actions for people with disabilities.Those actions were developed by TAFE NSW tasking Team and included a focus on disability awareness.In the period before the Games, TAFENSW was a reference in Australia on the issue of Education and Training of People with Disabilities or Learning Difficulties (VET). At the time, around 6000 students were part of the VET program.In order to complement these efforts, SOCOG&#x27;s internal training team, which was made up of highly prestigious employees from the Olympic Organizing Committee and TAFE NSW, were no complemented by other outstanding employees from TAFE NSW. However, now with specific knowledge and experience in the VET area.

=== Service Clubs ===
Part of the local community involvement program also took place in the third sector through service clubs or associations.In this group were Rotary International, Apex Clubs of Australia, Lions Clubs International, Freemasonry, Soroptimist International and Zonta International worked together with the SPOC on projects to send groups of spectators.It is noteworthy that they also helped finance the logistics so that schools and socially vulnerable groups could go to venues during the Games.Another groups such as Probus Clubs and Legacy Australia 
were encouraged to take actions and led their members to the be present at the Games.These actions also encompassed national scout and guide groups across Australia.As part of the education programs,they also received training about the Paralympic Games and their families also participated in the entire process, which culminated in active participation in several actions that took place in Sydney during the Games.

=== Multiculturalism ===
Just like the Olympic Games, the issue of multiculturalism in Australia was part of the planning of actions related to the Paralympic Games. Alongside SOCOG, SPOC developed several actions related to these delicate issues.This led a encouraging links between Australian ethnic groups and the visitors from other countries.and these communities worked alongside the organization to reach a new level of spectator support, raise funds and also provide a specific group of volunteers specialized in translation.

=== Spheres of Local Government ===
All spheres of federal, state and locals government in Australia contributed to help and held the financial and promotional support to the Paralympic Games. It was observed that the effort regarding education programs also involved councilors, mayors, members of the state and federal parliaments and also the respective residents locals who also helped SPOC raise funds for the Games.

==Fundraising and Partnerships==
A number of connections and partnerships were made in unique ways and valuable Special Projects were made with particulars,business, professional and industrial groups. The main focus along the fundraising actions and raising awareness among the australian population to help to raise the necessary financial amounts in the final stretch of preparations for the Games.As the Games approached this list was progressively increased to the point that in the final remainder this number reached almost 45 partners and sponsors and in many cases sponsorships related to the Olympic Games were expanded. This is a list of those who first got involved with the financing actions. 

=== Partnerships Program ===
The Paralympic Partnerships Fund was a unique program that offered individuals, organisations, trusts and foundations, local councils, community groups and associations the opportunity to make a tax-deductible specific and abrangente donation towards the successful staging of the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. started at amounts above AUS
$3,000 and were made appropriately and in proportion to the donated amounts made at various levels, from framed certificates and lapel pins to VIP status during the Games.On the shared list were Telstra, IBM, supermarket chain Franklins which was responsible for the exclusive sale of licensed products from the Paralympic Games, Westpac, AMP, Bonds which supplied the uniforms for the volunteers and also various products licensees EnergyAustralia, Ansett Australia as the international logistics partner, Fuji Xerox, John Fairfax &amp; Sons, Swatch Group and Coca-Cola Amatil.On the list of exclusive sponsors were 2UE, Otto Bock, Shell and Boise Cascade.The following were already on the list of suppliers Woolcott Research, Rogen and Gerflor.

=== Seniors Card NSW ===
One of these partnerships was with Seniors Card NSW (which is an institutional elderly benefit card from the state of New South Wales).Creating a specific fundraising program called &quot;One Million Smiles&quot;, committing to raising an amount over more than AUD$ 1 million in small charitable actions. This partnership was also responsible for guaranteeing the registration of more than 10,000 potential volunteers.
=== Quilts 2000 ===
Some of Australia&#x27;s best and largest quilt makers have embarked on a project involving potentially more than 40,000 people who have created specific designs to be sold at auctions or other events to raise funds for the Paralympics.In total around 650 quilts were made and displayed in all major Australian cities with around 50 being sold in the pre-sale process raising around AUD$50,000.The mayor of the Paralympic Village, former prime minister Tim Fischer, announced that 60 of them were chosen to be displayed in the offices and international zone areas of the village during the Olympic and Paralympic Games within a decision that made sense, as these were the two busiest areas during both events.
=== St. Andrew&#x27;s Student Business Club ===
Between 1999 and 2000, the Student Business Club of St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney School organized a number of activities to raise more than AUD$100,000 for the Paralympic Games, organizing an annual Celebrity Golf Day and a series of Gala Dinners and Auctions.

=== Participation of Contractors ===
Another partnership developed was with the joint venture between the Transfield Holdings and the French company Bouygues, which was responsible for the construction of Airport Link, Sydney and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel supported the Paralympic Games through public fundraising events at various public and private events. They also purchased some sponsorship shares months before the Games took place.

=== NSWM Real Estate Institute (REI) ===
NSW real estate agents were encouraged by REI to consolidate their annual fundraising initiatives and this led to some groups to sending part of these funds to the management of the Paralympic Games. A number of additional fundraising initiatives and Games involvement opportunities were promoted by REI in the run-up to the Games.

=== Holy Grail: The Official Album ===
Another initiative that helped to finance the Games was the sale of the official album called &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and which was released on October 18, 1999, exactly one year before the opening ceremony.This album is a compilation of several songs that inspired Australia&#x27;s Paralympic athletes to achieve their greatest triumphs. The main goal of this album is to highlight and promote the Paralympic Games (held in Sydney, 18–29 October 2000) through the entertainment industry, as well as fundraising for the Paralympic Games.The concept of an official Paralympic Games CD was brought to Warner Music Australia by a member of the 2000 Paralympic Ceremonies Production Team, Michael Chugg, as part of an inclusive idea to consult with Australian athletes regarding those songs that inspired and motivated them.During the release of the album, Chugg mentioned that Louise Sauvage had chosen a song by Jimmy Barnes, called &quot;No second prize&quot;.In addition to the two official themes of the Games &quot;Being Here&quot; by Graeme Connors and &quot;Dots on the shells&quot; performed by Yothu Yindi &amp; Jim Kerr.Ten of Australia&#x27;s champion Paralympians have each chosen a piece of music which reflects their pride in the Games and their passion in performing. It is an emotion shared by the artists who perform their song.The CD was available at all australian record stores and a percentage from each CD sold was go towards staging the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games.Songs by Hunters &amp; Collectors, Van Halen, Barenaked ladies,The Whitlams,Cold Chisel,Richard Clapton,Icehouse,Pretenders, The Superjesus,Marie Wilson,Marcia Hines and Goanna are part of this soundtrack.

==Transport and logistics operations==
Logistics management during the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games were a big disaster and were a key result of the lack of collaboration between the organizers, the city of Atlanta and the Georgia state government. As the services did not communicate with each other, this led to huge traffic jams and other problems during competitions. In Atlanta, the majority of venues were outside the Olympic Ring and very far from the Paralympic Village. Since the bid projects, Sydney treated this issue in a different way, which practically transformed this issue into something much calmer and easier. As 20 of the 25 competition venues were all practically centralized in the same region neighbouring the Paralympic Village, Paralympic athletes could reach them on foot or by their wheels. In this way the joint planning from the beginning ended the possibilities of different logistics for the two events, leading the reduction of these operations. However, the distances between the Homebush Bay precinct to the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, the city Downtown and the most populated neighbourhoods and their suburbs. Ended up leading to the expansion of the actions of the Sydney Olympic Transport and Roads Authority (SORTA), which also assumed the responsibilities of planning, managing and executing all logistics activities during the two events. SORTA was responsible for developing specific and differentiated actions for each one. Among this group was the hiring of 27 buses adapted to transport the blind and wheelchair athletes during the Paralympics in the daily routes between the airport and the Paralympic Village and also those competition and tourist and other sites further away from the Games epicentre. In addition to the roads management and the logistic operations during the Games, SORTA was also owned the responsibility to monitor, organize and prepare all transport routes that would take the public to watch the events. This involved cars, buses, the subway and surface trains, since most of the public arrived during the games using the Olympic Park railway line stations.

==Political context==
With a few months to go until the opening ceremony, SOCOG was taken by surprise, when they found out behind the scenes that the pop diva Kylie Minogue and group Yothu Yindi were going to headline the Paralympic opening ceremonies. Some hours before this announcement becomes public, the Olympic organisers, quickly made an invitation to Minogue and Yothu Yindi to participate at the Opening Ceremonies. But, it was already known in Australia that Minogue was not able to be at the country on that week, because she had a full schedule in Europe to promote the upcoming release from the &quot;Light Years&quot; album scheduled for the upcoming week and wouldn&#x27;t have time to get to Sydney before the ceremony. Kylie and the rock band performed at the Olympics Closing Ceremonies instead.

Despite 5 years of mediation and collaboration by the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), relations between the two Organizing Committees strained in the so-called transition period between the two events that lasted 16 days
(2 to 18 October 2000). Lead by OCA, there&#x27;s a common commitment to make Sydney 2000 a joint-success. But, after the Olympics Closing Ceremonies, some attitudes on the part of some Olympic authorities caused a lot of embarrassment to the locals. A few hours after the end of the Olympic Games, SOCOG and Sydney City Council announced in a joint statement that the giant Olympic rings that were hanging on the Harbour Bridge during the 16-day Olympic Games would be immediately removed. And this decision ended up overshadowing the ritual of lighting the Paralympic fire at the gardens of Australian Parliament Hill in Canberra. that would take place days later. A few hours later, the chairman of SOCOG, Michael Knight, that he would no longer participate in all those public events that were related to the Paralympic Games. To the public opinion, this decision was frowned upon and was also seen as an insensitive, authoritarian, and self-centred attitude in 
being also seen as a retaliation for some actions by the Paralympics organization that &quot;ended up attracting more attention than the organization of the Olympic Games&quot;. Hours after this announcement, SOCOG scheduled a party for October 17th as a way of celebrating the help of volunteers in making the 2000 Summer Olympic Games a success. However, this chosen date clashed with the date on which the Paralympic torch would arrive in Sydney and refused to re-mark this celebration. 

==Controversies==
The Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games were marred by a scandal which saw a Intelectual Disability athletes removed from the next two Summer Paralympics. Fernando Vicente Martin, former head of the Spanish Federation for Mentally Handicapped Sports, allowed athletes without disabilities to compete at the Games in order to win the biggest possible number of gold medals. The distrust regarding this issue began during the first games of the Basketball ID tournament when some of the players&#x27; gestures, postures and behaviors did not match the type of disability they claimed to have. It was claimed that at least 10 of the 12 Spanish players had no disability, rather were recruited to improve the team&#x27;s performance and guarantee future funding. Martin was later suspended by the IPC and expelled by the Spanish Paralympic Committee.The ID athletes were quickly exposed and after some studies, the International Paralympic Committee decided that starting at the 2002 Winter Paralympics which were scheduled for Salt Lake City,USA events for ID athletes were removed from the program. This decision was overturned only in 2009, when they could be back to games during the 2012 Summer Paralympics. 

Along with the controversies surrounding the Spanish basketball team. Sydney recorded the highest number of positive doping cases in the history of the Paralympics to date. Out of 630 tests carried out, 11 athletes tested positive for various substances.

==Mascot==

The mascot for the 2000 Paralympics was &quot;Lizzie&quot; the Frill-necked Lizard.

== Look of the Games ==
Despite all the approximation and development in common through the development of shared actions. The two events had different visual and corporate identities at the beginning, and this caused a differentiation of colour palettes, logos and other secondary characteristics, and led to the development of a specific department to look after the Paralympic Look of the Games. This group was responsible for providing a decoration, wayfinding and a common mark and identification program for some 20 competition venues, five major non-competition venues, the Sydney Olympic Park (SOP), and the touristic and common places in Sydney and Parramata. However, this group operated on an extremely smaller budget than its Olympic counterpart. This led in actions that led to the maximum reuse of several elements that were used during the Olympic Games. However, there was an audit to see which ones were in condition to be reused and were not discarded. Thus, a huge number of plaques and kits of parts were recovered or kept while those that were discarded were replaced by the Paralympic brand/identity along the specific graphics. Thus, those elements in which the &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; brand was used were maintained, with a view to maintaining the festive atmosphere experienced at the Olympic Games and also to demonstrate the similarity of the two events. The aim was to give the venues a fresh Paralympic identity, while maintaining the atmosphere of festivity and a similar level of presentation as the Olympic Games.

=== Overlay time ===

The situations experienced in Atlanta and Nagano regarding the visual identities of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in which they clashed and led to numerous problems and lawsuits and a lack of identification and differentiation by athletes, local communities and spectators. Due to these issues, for the first time a games overlay program was developed.

Between 1997 and 1999 a specific and different visual identity for the Paralympics was developed, but due to internal administrative and financial issues at the Olympic Organizing Committee who that made the applications simpler and integrated them with the Paralympic Games. An example of this integration was the creation of eight new specific paralympic sporting pictograms. Another integration in common was the use of the blue colour, the mark &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; and the graphics works called &quot;fluid energy&quot;. However, with new elements now in eucalyptus green. A survey with managers of competitions and arenas about possible changes in the visual identity during the Paralympics. The vast majority opted for maintaining the one used during the Olympics. However, minor changes had to be made in almost all marks and elements on all playing fields and information boards, which gave the impression that the two events were part of the same. Only in drastic cases, such as the three basketball and wheelchair rugby arenas, there was a need to change the floors of the courts that had the Olympic brand.

The solution for the changes of marks was simple due the low budget used. They covered with stickers in which the SOCOG and IOC brands were covered by the SPOC and IPC brands, lowering costs. Another plan was relocating that elements who were in good conditions to using in another areas. For this action, a list of priority locations was created, based on the profile of each sport and also on their maintenance costs. On average, each received AU$5,000, with the most expensive amount invested in the Olympic Stadium being AU$80,000. The original values were stipuled because of the reuse of most of the visual aspects of the Olympic Games, which were mostly made of recycled fabrics, cardboard and another flexible materials. Soon after adjustments, the final requirements were made in some specific and common festive areas, who were made after the execution of Olympic conversion and the technical-operational requirements, they were handed over to the respective operational managers. The planning also managed to produce results in the 5 venues outside the Olympic Park that managed to fully maintain the visual elements of the Olympic Games and also received others that came from other locations and that in some cases there was a need to cover Olympic symbols and change the brands. However, the Olympic Park became a problem during the event conversion period. In order for their Paralympic mode to be implemented and executed a last moment. Nearly 2/3 of the plates and identification signs were removed in its conversion in an intention to facilitate the operations during the Paralympics. Several new demands appeared due to the fact that 2/3 of the material that would be used ended up being discarded or having some type of related problems.

===Logo===
The Sydney 2000 Summer Paralympics logo and Paralympic torch were developed by marketing agency FHA Image Design from Melbourne and went public on 18 October 1996, four years before the opening ceremony, in a special event held at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.It is observed that despite being initially different visual identities, Sydney&#x27;s Olympic and Paralympic identities complement each other and are personified by the same elements and graphic traces.

The Victorian agency was already involved with all the visual planning for both the Olympics and the Paralympics and unified several visual elements of the two events such as the pictograms, the street signals and the trademarks under the name of &quot;Sydney 2000&quot;. The 2000 Summer Paralympic Games logo was a representative of a dynamic human form leaping triumphantly forward and &#x27;breaking through&#x27; towards the games.

The logo came to life, three years after its launch, with the announcement of the Paralympic torch that it was in fact the Paralympic spirit in action. As the visual identity of the event that was focused on the energy dissipated by the paralympic athletes. It represented the energy dissipated by a paralympic athlete when &quot;breaking a barrier&quot; or a &quot;wall of bricks, concrete or glass&quot;. This is also reflected in the Paralympic fire and the spirit, composed at the time by the motto of &quot;body, mind and spirit&quot;.

Another image that can be seen in it is the Paralympic torch that is in a handover position for the next carrier in inspiring views to the world and the future with the use of Futura Typeface to write the games, host city&#x27;s and year&#x27;s names. The host&#x27;s unique characteristics are seen in the fact that it also refers to the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour with its sea and the boats that are part of the most famous cityscape around the world, through the use of three exclusive graphic shapes who refer to this feature. The agency even developed unique tones of the 3 colours of the Paralympic flag to represent unique characteristics of the host country: the ocean blue represented the two oceans that bathe Australia: the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, the warm red of the Outback and a lush forest green which represent the Australia&#x27;s endemic plants and animal species. The logo also embodies the host city vitality, Australia&#x27;s spirit, and the achievements of a Paralympic athlete.

===Ticket design===
The comprehensive signage strategy, a design application specifically for the Paralympic Games, was fully connected to ticket design and layout and used a much simpler visual system, based on the Games logo, where the graphics were much larger.

== Invincible Summer:Paralympic Arts Festival==
As Atlanta and Nagano,Sydney had a Cultural Paralympiad,curated by Leo Schofield
A film festival with ducks, aerial acrobatics and dances in the middle of the street, giant puppets, giant dancing cows and singing sharks, Senegalese drummers and syncopated Australian singers raised the level of excitement at Sydney Olympic Park during the Games.This program, which was listed as innovative.This program, which was considered innovative, began with a Paralympic Games Gala Concert at the Sydney Opera House, the Sea 2000 Choir and a notable theater and dance program involving artists with disabilities around the world at the University of Sydney&#x27;s Seymour Theater Centre.

Spread across the city, several visual arts exhibitions are held, with multimedia experiences, visitors were able to experience works of art from the United States, France, Mexico, United Kingdom, Sweden, Brazil, Vietnam, Japan, Egypt and the Czech Republic, as well as one of the main artistic main names in Australia.

==Ceremonies==
=== Opening Ceremonies ===



The opening ceremony commenced on Wednesday 18 October at 8.00 pm with over 6000 performers and volunteers taking part. The show started by the Australian wheelchair artist Jeffrey St. John sang the national anthem &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; and &quot;The Challenge&quot;. The 2-hours and half ceremonies ended when Kylie Minogue take the stage with a special acapella version of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, her rendition of Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Celebration&quot; and her current hit &quot;Spinning Around&quot;.World-known Australian actor Bryan Brown acted as the narrator for the event. Among Yothu Yindi performers for the Opening Ceremony included the bands Taxiride, with Nathan Cavaleri, Melissa Ippolito, Billy Thorpe, Jack Thompson, the singers Renee Geyer, Tina Harris, Vanessa Amorosi and the cultural part was opened by Christine Anu. Australian country artist Graeme Connors sang &quot;Being Here&quot;, as the event&#x27;s official theme song. Addresses were given by John Grant, president of the SPOC, and Robert Steadward, president of the IPC, prior to Sir William Deane declaring the official opening of the games. This was followed by Tracey Cross, a blind swimmer, taking the oath on behalf of the athletes and Mary Longden, an Equestrian referee, taking the oath on behalf of the officials.

The Paralympic torch relay final leg ended with Louise Sauvage, who lit the cauldron.

=== Closing ceremonies ===
The closing ceremony took place as planned on the evening Sunday, 29 October. The event started at 7:30 pm and was 
a party filled with fireworks, emotions and celebrations. After the last finals, all the athletes met for the last time to say goodbye to the Games. While Sydney was making history, the future of the Summer Paralympic Games was uncertain and obscure. This concern made sense because the host city contract and a multitude of issues turned the holding of the next edition into something totally uncertain and insecure. This issue was a result of the fact that negotiations between the International Paralympic Committee and the Greek authorities had stalled for a few months. and this could remove the Paralympic Games from Athens and transfer them to any other place, putting at risk any type of planning made by athletes, managers and other stakeholders. The crisis between the IPC and the Greek authorities was another chapter in the tense relationship between the IOC and them, which was revealed at the beginning of that year and it became so serious that the then president of the Olympic entity, the Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch, had to intervene directly in the ATHOC because of the higher number of delays and bureaucratic obstacles that put the holding of the Olympic Games at risk.


Although the IOC&#x27;s intervention at ATHOC was unprecedented, the lethargy of the Greek organizers in signing the documentation relating to the guarantees for the 2004 Summer Paralympic Games, irritated and embarrassed the International Paralympic Committee, to the point that during its first press conference held in Sydney, the then president of the IPC, Canadian Robert Steadward, made days before the opening ceremony made public that negotiations with Athens &quot;had not progressed as expected in 1997&quot; and &quot;that until that moment the host city contract for the next summer edition had not been signed&quot;. Which reflected &quot;the treatment that people with disabilities were treated in Greece, placing them as second-class people&quot;. Furthermore, his criticisms made a lot of sense, since the Paralympic Games were relatively unknown to the majority of the Greek population and the local authorities &quot;did not stand by&quot;. Since the resumption of holding the Olympics and Paralympics in the same host city in 1988, this type of situation had not happened and as the uncertainties were real there was a risk that any reference to Athens or Greece would be removed from the closing ceremonies official protocol. This also probably involved a performance of the Greek anthem, the mention of Athens in the closing declaration and even the cancellation of the Paralympic flag handover with the expected cultural demonstration in the so-called Antwerp ceremony. This slowness in the process and also some embarrassing situations due to the ill will of the then Greek Organizing Committee encouraged other cities around the world that wanted to host the Paralympic Games in Athens&#x27; place. Rumors suggested that the Games in could stay in Sydney, due to the resounding success of this edition or that Stockholm, Cape Town (which lost the right to host the 2004 Summer Olympics to Athens), in addition to Barcelona and a joint project London and Manchester could already be in secret negotiations.

Stedward&#x27;s scolding did not go down very well with the authorities of the Greek government and the city of Athens, who the following day countered the criticism. made public that &quot;due to the intervention made by the International Olympic Committee since May 9 of this year, all negotiations between ATHOC and the International Paralympic Committee are suspended indefinitely. The city of Athens publicly commits to hosting the 2004 Summer Paralympics, but it still cannot give real guarantees for this, as it does not agree with some terms proposed in the host city contract proposed by the IPC. Further details will be provided soon when these issues are resolved in the progress of these negotiations. &quot;Due to complete ignorance of these issues, Athens city hall was left in a &quot;crossfire&quot; situation, as it was in the middle of exchanging accusations between the Organizers and the Costas Simitis cabinet.

The issues of stress regarding these issues that could not be made public until that moment reached the ears of the IOC, which began to try to mediate the situation. But, even before the conclusion, the Athens city council, as a sign of goodwill in negotiating these &quot;controversial&quot; terms, decided to send a last-minute small informal delegation to Sydney to participate in the closing ceremony and receive the Paralympic flag. This delegation was led by the then-deputy mayor Nikos Yiatrakos to receive the Paralympic flag on behalf of the city during the closing ceremony. Confirming the real intentions of the Greeks in hosting the Paralympic Games. A few days later it emerged that the issue itself was related to the fact that the IPC was demanding that the Greeks would have to pay a guarantee of USD3 million, more than double what the Australians had paid. Sometime later it was discovered that these 3 million dollars were related to the cost of registration fees for Paralympic athletes and that they were only guaranteed after the IOC injected part of this money through the first mutual collaboration agreement signed during the Sydney Games.

The IPC has expressed its concern, noting that Greek organizers have shown little interest in the Games. This was the case from the beginning. When Athens won the bid for the 2004 games they expressed surprise when they were told afterwards that this also meant they would host the Paralympic Games. The IPC has expressed its concern, noting that Greek organizers have shown little interest in Paralympics. But later they were shocked when they discovered that this would also take into account that they had the responsibility of jointly hosting the Paralympics.

Since until that date there was no official Hellenic Paralympic Committee and the host city contract was not signed. The surprise arrival of the delegation was seen by the Australians and by the IPC itself as a sign of acceptance of criticism and also of humility and goodwill and as a sign of this, SPOC agreed to produce a more simpler Paralympic handover ceremony than usual. To ensure this gap, the Australian producers invited the Millennium Choir of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia to made a special performance from the Mikis Theodorakis song &quot;Tis Dikaiosinis Ilie &quot; (&quot;Sun of Justice&quot;, from the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;). To close the ceremonies, the first Australian group to make international success outside the country, The Seekers, closed the games with their world know hit song &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;. The band was originally meant to be the last act of the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics, but due to an accident some days before the event resulting in a broken hip, they moved their performance to the Paralympics and the lead singer Judith Durham sang the song sitting in a wheelchair.

A dispute with the Greeks would only be resolved in April 2001 when the host city contract was finally signed.

==Torch relay==
===Torch Design===
How the Games logo became something real and physical, the theme of the relay was &quot;Lighting the Way&quot; because in addition to lighting the way to the Olympic Stadium, SPOC wanted this relay to also be an event to raise awareness about the culture of safe traffic, as this is still the biggest cause of paraplegia around the world.

Made from the same material and with the same combustion system as its Olympic counterpart The Sydney 2000 Paralympic torch,was a real representation of the games logo and when fully assembled it weighed around 1.5 kg and was 72 cm tall, being minimally smaller than its Olympic sister.
The torch was drafted in 1997 by one of the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee&#x27;s (SPOC) in-house designers, who designed the first torch shell, referencing the layered, arched logo of the Sydney Paralympic Games.Between July 1998 and March 1999, the torch&#x27;s design was refined and minimally changed by Sydney toolmakers and metal pressing specialists, G.A.&amp; L. Harrington (GALH), which resolved issues relating to the interlocking shells, choke, filtering system, colours, surface textures and other elements. Following the media launch, on 8 March 1999, the company started torch production, making 1000 Paralympic torches (around 100 were made as a reserve supply) and 14,000 Olympic torches by early 2000.

===The relay===
The 2000 Summer Paralympic torch was born from a ritual carried out by the people Ngunnawal at Australian Parlament House gardens held on 5 October 2000. In this ritual was also present the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and the first torchbearer, the wheelchair tennis player David Hall, who, along the present public, witnessed the lighting of the flame on the forecourt of Parliament House, Canberra, and the performance of traditional and contemporary indigenous dance. In this ritual, three generations of the community, who are the original inhabitants of the Australian Capital Territory area, were involved today in creating the flame to fuel the MAA Sydney 2000 Paralympic Torch Relay as it travels around Australia. The Ngunnawal dancers, painted in ochre, then joined the three generations of the Ngunnawal community, who passed the firestick from the eldest to the youngest generation who lit the cauldron as dawn broke. The smoking then continued, with ceremonial smoking bowls of burning eucalyptus leaves used to welcome strangers and protect them. But, in this case, the smoke and the fire personify the Paralympic spirit, providing protection to athletes and all those who would be arriving at the next days.

It was up to SPOC&#x27;s first specific partner, the Motor Accidents Authority of NSW (MAA) (who acted in a similar way which operated in a similar way to the Shepherd Center in 1996), all the responsibility for sponsorship, logistics operations and other actions relative to the Paralympic torch relay as part of a public awareness campaign regarding safe traffic. MAA strengthened its relations with SPOC in June 1997, when evolved to the first the first specific sponsor for the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games. Since the start, the Authority was extensively involved in sport for people with a disability. At the same time as investing in the promotion and organization of the event, MAA was responsible for carrying out a campaign and an awareness program focused on 13 to 25 year students about safe traffic and the catastrophic consequences of not respecting its rules. For this to be done, 16 Australian para-athletes who were victims of accidents were recruited to form a team of ambassadors in which they &quot;were living proof that accidents can happen&quot; and that if there was conscious responsibility on the part of those who are driving, these accidents would not even happen.Later,9 other athletes who were born with some other disability joined the team. MAA also gave 300 people a chance to carry the torch in the Torch Relay competition. In order for a person to apply, they must be over 12 years old during October 2000 and also be a permanent resident of Australia.

The function of the relay was to maintain the level of excitement and engagement of the Australian population during the transition period between the two events. His role was also to raise awareness among the population about the issue of integrating people with disabilities into society, traffic safety and several other issues. However, the land route was centred in New South Wales because it was there that the organization decided focus on ticket sales due to the close distance from Sydney.

The Paralympic Torch Relay succeeded in generating community and media support for the Games, with crowds in many areas and significant crowds lining the Sydney metropolitan route in the final two days of the relay and was the conclusion of a project that began through an educational process that began in 1997, when a totally different strategy was developed.

====Torch Relay Route====

The then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, announced his government&#x27;s support of the MAA Sydney 2000 Paralympic Torch Relay at a launch of the torch design and route in Canberra on 28 July 1999.But originally, this would be a relay exclusively within the state of New South Wales, with the torch going exclusively overland between the Australian capital Canberra to Sydney, passing only through the state&#x27;s roads.
However, in September 1999, the Federal Government of Australia announced that it was allocating an extra amount of around AU$500.0000 for the relay to visit other Australian states in their capitals
The first phase of the relay route involved the capitals of the six Australian states and the two contiguous territories, where the torch passed in a clockwise way. At the first morning the fire spent the morning in the Canberra area visiting the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and passing nearby Duntroon before it boarded in a Royal Australian Air Force Falcon 900 executive jet in way for Melbourne. This air route covered 11,500 km by air and after Melbourne the torch visited: Hobart (6 October), Adelaide (7 October), Perth (8 October), Darwin (9 October) and Brisbane (10 October) before starting a 750 km journey by road in New South Wales starting at the Moss Vale on 12 October. During the land component, the torch travelled about 7.5 kilometres per hour and covered around 65 kilometres per day. On average, each bearer ran with the torch for 1 km each. With each day of the relay ending at night in a major center, the torch travelled through 30 cities and towns during the 14 days of its route. The last two major urban centres in which the torch made its way were Newcastle and Wollongong, where it entered the Sydney Metropolitan Region, where it spent approximately two days before it makes its way to the Opening Ceremony. The route was developed so that each community makes the most of the torch&#x27;s stay in its territory. It was also highlighted that there were several differences between the Olympic torch route and the Paralympic torch route in different aspects and points of interest. It is also noteworthy that each day of the relay lasted an average of 10 hours and during each night, members of the NSW Police Service were responsible for keeping the flame inside the lantern.

The comeback journey in New South Wales had legs at the Southern Highlands, Illawarra, Campbelltown, Penrith, Windsor, Hunter and Central Coast areas, before heading to Sydney on 16 October 2000 when the torch visited the city mainland marks. Also on October 17, the Paralympic flame was carried across the main arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge by four torchbearers.

The then Motor Accidents Authority of New South Wales was responsible for the planning, logistics and execution of the relay alongside the Australian State Security Forces and at the same time, 
== Sports and impairment groups ==
The final program of the Games was presented by the Executive Council of the IPC in a meeting that took place between 12 and 16 March 1997 in Sweden. At this same meeting, SPOC presented its sustainability policies that were developed in a connected way and mirrored those implemented by SOOCOG. This program proposals needed to be independently approved by both the IPC and SPOC.

The first version of this edition&#x27;s sports program was approved in September 1996, when the IPC Executive Board decided in a session held during the Atlanta Games that at the same time as lawn bowls would leave the program, wheelchair rugby and sailing would evolve into sports included in the official program, after being demonstration sports that year.The preliminary number of events planned for the Games was impressive because it was planned to hold 582 finals in 18 sports.However, this number fell at the beginning of 2000 to 551, as 31 events were discarded from the program for various reasons such as a low number of registrants, low or insuficient technical level recorded during the process of classification, review and merger of functional classes.

==Games highlights==

The amount of advances and the strategy of transforming the event into something unprecedented, caused the then president of the International Paralympic Committee,the canadian Robert Stedward declared that Sydney had so far been the &quot;best Paralympics in history&quot; and the commitment of an entire society was reflected in more than 1.2 million tickets sold (exceeding the organizers&#x27; expectations by more than 100.000), well more than twice as many as were sold four years earlier in Atlanta.and it was very common to observe, during the 12 days of the Games, crowded arenas with a totally different audience than that seen at the Olympic Games.And such excitement from the public was reflected in the athletes resulting in the breaking of more than 300 world and Paralympic records.

The organizers proved that the risky proposal,resulted in a impacted success, with no type of differentiation in the basic services offered in the Paralympic Village. The information technologics, medical care and logistics systems were extended to the Games.There was not even any differentiation in services offered to the public present in the arenas.During the Games, the Paralympic Village housed near 7000 people. There were 3,824 athletes, 2,315 team officials and 804 technical officials. For the hosts, this edition is even more historic, because from the first day they remained in first place in the medals table and consolidated this position with 63 gold, 39 silver and 47 bronze medals, for a total of 149.Birth of the Paralympic Moviment, Great Britain took the 41 gold medals most silver medals, with 43, and tied Australia for the most bronze medals, with 47,reaching 131.

There were numerous athletes who contributed multiple medals to their national tally. In the pool these included Béatrice Hess of France who won seven golds, Mayumi Narita of Japan who won six golds and a silver, Siobhan Paton of Australia who won six golds in individual events, and Stéphanie Dixon of Canada and Hong Yan Zhu of China who each won five golds. On the track Tim Sullivan of Australia won five golds, and Tanni Grey-Thompson of Great Britain won four.

However, it stands out that in individual terms, the greatest performances came from Australian athletes.The host team had a number of notable gold and historial medal-winning performances. Individual achievements included swimmer Siobhan Paton&#x27;s six gold medals in the 200m SM14 individual medley, and S14 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly, 50m backstroke, 200m freestyle, and 50m freestyle. She set nine world records in the process.

Tim Sullivan topped the athletics medal tally with five gold medals. Sullivan won three gold medals in the T38 200m, 100m, and 400m events, and won the two gold medals at their relays Darren Thrupp, Adrian Grogan and Kieran Ault-Connell (T38 4X400m and 4X100m races). The top performing female track and field athlete was Lisa Llorens, who won three gold medals from the F20 high jump, long jump and T20 200m. Llorens also won a silver medal in the T20 100m.

Other track medallists included Neil Fuller won two golds in the T44 200m, and 400m events, as well as one individual bronze medal in the T44 100m. Fuller later combined with Tim Matthews, Stephen Wilson and Heath Francis to win another two gold medals in the T45 4X100m relay and T46 4X400m relay. Francis also went on to win a total of three golds and one silver after also winning an individual gold and silver in the T46 400m and T46 200m events respectively. Other track medallists were Amy Winters with two golds in the T46 200m and 100m T46, and a bronze in the T46 400m. Greg Smith also won three gold medals in the 800m, 5,000m and 1,500m T52 events.

In cycling, Matthew Gray won two golds in the velodrome in the individual cycling mixed 1 km time trial LC1, and a gold in the mixed team sprint with Paul Lake and Greg Ball. Sarnya Parker and Tania Morda also won two golds in the women&#x27;s cycling tandem 1 km time trial and women&#x27;s tandem cycling individual pursuit open.

=== Views ===
An example of this change in perception is cited by the British para-athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson,a multiple Paralympic gold winner, later said of the Sydney Games:

==Medal count==


A total of 1657 medals were awarded during the Sydney games: 550 gold, 549 silver, and 558 bronze. The host country, Australia, topped the medal count with more gold medals and more medals overall than any other nation. Great Britain took the most silver medals, with 43, and tied Australia for the most bronze medals, with 47.

In the table below, the ranking sorts by the number of gold medals earned by a nation (in this context a nation is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

== Participating delegations ==
Originally, organizers expected 136 countries to participate in the Games, but only 123 sent their delegations to the Sydney Paralympics. Included among them was a team of &quot;Individual Paralympic Athletes&quot; from East Timor. The newly independent country had not yet established a National Paralympic Committee in time for send a delegation to Sydney, so the International Paralympic Committee invited East Timorese athletes to compete at the games under the title of Individual Paralympic Athletes.

Afghanistan did not participate in the 2000 Summer Paralympics, having been banned from the Games due to its treatment of women under Taliban rule.

El Salvador and Turkey were the only countries that were present in Barcelona and returned to compete in Sydney.

Barbados, Benin, Cambodia, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia, Palestine, Rwanda, Samoa, Turkmenistan, Vanuatu and Vietnam competed for the first time.

Cameroon,Cote D&#x27;Ivoire,
Guatemala,Guinea, Iraq,Nicaragua,Niger, Sierra Leone and Sudan classified athletes or won wildcards, but due to financial reasons they were unable to send their delegations to Sydney,and it was because of these denials that the IPC changed several clauses regarding the charging of registration fees in the contract relating to the 2004 Summer Paralympic Games and led to delays in the signing of the host city contract. Dominican Republic, Luxembourg, and Mauritius,who send delegations to Atlanta, did not classify athletes to compete in Sydney.

== Media coverage ==
Media coverage of the Paralympic Games has steadily increased over the years.

In the table below, the approximate number of accredited media at the Paralympic Summer Games from 1992 to 2008 has been listed.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had approximately 200 staff in Sydney for the Olympic games, 6 of whom stayed on to cover the Paralympic games. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired four one-hour shows of the Paralympic Games after the event was finished.

TV New Zealand also aired four one-hour highlights of the event after their ending.

In the United States, CBS broadcast a special called &quot;Role Models for the 21st Century: The Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games&quot;. The special was two hours long and aired in November.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) allowed their viewers the opportunity to express their opinions towards the games. Comments were posted under the heading &quot;Has the Sydney Paralympics been a success?&quot; on their website. One viewer, Carole Neale from England, was cited as posting: &quot;I am so disappointed to find the coverage limited to less than an hour per evening, on at a time when most people are still travelling home from work, and dismissed to BBC2, unlike the Olympics which had a prime time evening slot on BBC1 as well as constant live coverage&quot;.

<doc id="333677" wikidata="Q93430594" url="?curid=333677" title="Nowhere continuous function">
<text>In mathematics, a nowhere continuous function, also called an everywhere discontinuous function, is a function that is not continuous at any point of its domain. If formula_1 is a function from real numbers to real numbers, then formula_1 is nowhere continuous if for each point formula_3 there is some formula_4 such that for every formula_5 we can find a point formula_6 such that formula_7 and formula_8. Therefore, no matter how close it gets to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.

More general definitions of this kind of function can be obtained, by replacing the absolute value by the distance function in a metric space, or by using the definition of continuity in a topological space.

==Examples==

===Dirichlet function===
One example of such a function is the indicator function of the rational numbers, also known as the Dirichlet function. This function is denoted as formula_9 and has domain and codomain both equal to the real numbers. By definition, formula_10 is equal to formula_11 if formula_3 is a rational number and it is formula_13 otherwise. 

More generally, if formula_14 is any subset of a topological space formula_15 such that both formula_14 and the complement of formula_14 are dense in formula_18 then the real-valued function which takes the value formula_11 on formula_14 and formula_13 on the complement of formula_14 will be nowhere continuous. Functions of this type were originally investigated by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

===Non-trivial additive functions===
A function formula_23 is called an if it satisfies Cauchy&#x27;s functional equation:
formula_24 
For example, every map of form formula_25 where formula_26 is some constant, is additive (in fact, it is linear and continuous). Furthermore, every linear map formula_27 is of this form (by taking formula_28). 

Although every linear map is additive, not all additive maps are linear. An additive map formula_23 is linear if and only if there exists a point at which it is continuous, in which case it is continuous everywhere. Consequently, every non-linear additive function formula_30 is discontinuous at every point of its domain. 
Nevertheless, the restriction of any additive function formula_23 to any real scalar multiple of the rational numbers formula_32 is continuous; explicitly, this means that for every real formula_33 the restriction formula_34 to the set formula_35 is a continuous function. 
Thus if formula_23 is a non-linear additive function then for every point formula_37 formula_1 is discontinuous at formula_3 but formula_3 is also contained in some dense subset formula_41 on which formula_1&#x27;s restriction formula_43 is continuous (specifically, take formula_44 if formula_45 and take formula_46 if formula_47).

===Discontinuous linear maps===

A linear map between two topological vector spaces, such as normed spaces for example, is continuous (everywhere) if and only if there exists a point at which it is continuous, in which case it is even uniformly continuous. Consequently, every linear map is either continuous everywhere or else continuous nowhere.
Every linear functional is a linear map and on every infinite-dimensional normed space, there exists some discontinuous linear functional.

===Other functions===

The Conway base 13 function is discontinuous at every point.

==Hyperreal characterisation==

A real function formula_1 is nowhere continuous if its natural hyperreal extension has the property that every formula_3 is infinitely close to a formula_6 such that the difference formula_51 is appreciable (that is, not infinitesimal).

==See also==

* Blumberg theoremeven if a real function formula_23 is nowhere continuous, there is a dense subset formula_53 of formula_54 such that the restriction of formula_1 to formula_53 is continuous.
* Thomae&#x27;s function (also known as the popcorn function)a function that is continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers.

<doc id="333680" wikidata="Q232047" url="?curid=333680" title="Elizabeth Perkins">
<text>Elizabeth Perkins (born November 18, 1960) is an American actress. She is known for her roles in films including &quot;About Last Night&quot; (1986), &quot;From the Hip&quot; (1987), &quot;Big&quot; (1988), &quot;Enid Is Sleeping&quot; (1990), &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994), &quot;Moonlight and Valentino&quot; (1995), &quot;The Ring Two&quot; (2005) and &quot;Hop&quot; (2011). She is also well known for her role as Celia Hodes in the Showtime TV series &quot;Weeds&quot;, for which she received three Primetime Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations.

== Early life ==
Perkins&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Greek immigrants from Salonika who anglicized their surname from &quot;Pisperikos&quot; to &quot;Perkins&quot; when they moved to the United States. 

Perkins was raised in Colrain, Massachusetts; her parents divorced in 1963. She began working in theatre with Arena Civic Theatre, a non-profit community theatre group based in Greenfield, Massachusetts. Perkins attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, an elite preparatory school, and then spent 1978 to 1981 in Chicago attaining her Certificate in Acting from the Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University. In 1984, she made her theatrical debut on Broadway in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; and afterward, worked in a number of ensemble companies, including The New York Shakespeare Festival and the Steppenwolf Theater.

== Career ==
Perkins was listed as one of the 12 &quot;Promising New Actors of 1986&quot; in John Willis&#x27; Screen World. She made her film debut in 1986 in Edward Zwick&#x27;s &quot;About Last Night...&quot; and had a career breakthrough co-starring with Tom Hanks in &quot;Big&quot;. She received critical acclaim for her performance in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Avalon&quot;, and was a standout opposite William Hurt in &quot;The Doctor&quot; (1991), receiving critical acclaim for her performance as a terminal cancer patient. In 1993, Perkins appeared in the television project &quot;For Their Own Good&quot;. She later starred in the comedy series &quot;Battery Park&quot; and has appeared in television and films, including 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (starring as Wilma Flintstone) and &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (starring as Dorey Walker), and 2000&#x27;s &quot;28 Days&quot; (starring as Sandra Bullock&#x27;s sister). Perkins also played a small voice role in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; as Coral, a clownfish who is Marlin&#x27;s wife and Nemo&#x27;s mother who is killed and eaten by a barracuda at the beginning of the film. Perkins also appeared as a psychiatrist in 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Ring Two&quot;, starring Naomi Watts.

From 2005 to 2009, Perkins played Celia Hodes, an alcoholic and image-obsessed parent–teacher association (PTA) mother, alongside Mary-Louise Parker and Justin Kirk on the Showtime series &quot;Weeds&quot;. For her work on &quot;Weeds&quot;, Perkins received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series, Miniseries or Made for TV Motion Picture (in 2006 and 2007). She was also nominated three times for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on &quot;Weeds&quot;. At a screening of the season 2 finale of &quot;Weeds&quot;, at the Museum of TV and Radio on October 25, 2006, Perkins said that she considers Celia Hodes her favorite role in her career. On May 6, 2010, she announced that the fifth season of &quot;Weeds&quot; was her last despite the cliffhanger her character had in the season finale.

She starred in the ABC comedy series &quot;How to Live with Your Parents (For the Rest of Your Life)&quot;. She played Birdie in the Netflix original series &quot;GLOW&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Perkins married Terry Kinney in 1984; they divorced in 1988. She has one daughter with Maurice Phillips. In 2000, she married Argentine-born cinematographer Julio Macat, gaining three stepsons: Maximillian, Alexander and Andreas.

In 2005, at the age of 44, she learned that she had latent autoimmune diabetes, a form of type 1 diabetes that is most often diagnosed in middle age.

In 2017, Perkins held a sign naming actor James Woods above the hashtag #MeToo during a rally against sexual harassment in Los Angeles.

<text>Star Wars Galaxies (&quot;Galaxies&quot;) is a discontinued &quot;Star Wars-&quot;themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows, developed by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) and published by LucasArts.

The open world Star Wars game was released in stores on 26 June 2003. &quot;Galaxies&quot; spawned several expansions and updates through 2005.

The servers shut down on 15 December 2011 due to contract expiration. There are several private emulator projects in various stages of development that intend to allow users to experience &quot;Galaxies&quot; in different incarnations of the game&#x27;s existence.

==Gameplay==
=== Races and Character Creation ===
The ten species that were available to players included: Human, Twi&#x27;lek, Zabrak, Wookiee, Trandoshan, Rodian, Mon Calamari, Bothan, Sullustan and Ithorian.

Players could hire Entertainers to change their appearance in-game, with even more options than those available at creation. Many visual aspects of a character were changeable after character creation except species and gender.

=== In-Game Professions ===
Before the New Game Enhancements (commonly referred to as the &quot;NGE&quot;), players had access to 34 professions, with six basic professions: Artisan, Brawler, Entertainer, Marksman, Medic, and Scout. There were a total of 24 advanced professions.

Each profession had advanced tier options, including hybrids that combined traits of two professions. Each profession consisted of a tree-like structure of skills, with a single Novice level, four independent branches with four levels, and a Master level which required completion of all four branches. Characters purchased these skills with experience points gained through a related activity. After the NGE, the developers added nine new professions: Jedi, Bounty Hunter, Smuggler, Commando, Spy, Officer, Medic, Entertainer, and Trader. Progress in these professions was divided into three separate experience source groups: combat, crafting, and entertaining. In addition to these professions, a character could also pursue three optional side professions: Pilot, Chronicler, and Politician.

Players could specialize in three different areas of their primary professions by selecting &quot;expertise&quot; options, including Beast Mastery (BM). The Trader profession shared not only BM expertise but also general expertise. All professions could specialize through expertise and items. The only role requiring a single profession was healer.

=== Spacecrafts ===
The &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot; expansion made individual ships attainable by players for the first time. This allowed players to acquire and pilot ships of various sizes. Ships ranged in size from fighter crafts to gunships with up to three decks. This gave players the option between space-based or planet-based gameplay.

=== Combat ===
Each character and creature possessed three &quot;pools&quot; (called Health, Action, and Mind; or &quot;HAM&quot;) that represented his or her physical and mental reserves. When any one of those pools was fully depleted, the character would faint. Combat required the player to carefully manage his or her actions to avoid depleting a pool.

With the NGE, ground combat was changed to real-time and similar to a first-person shooter. The player would aim a targeting reticule and left-click the mouse to fire. Auto-aim and auto-fire features were available, but players who eschewed those options were rewarded with an increased chance of maximum damage. As characters&#x27; levels increased, they gained access to additional combat abilities called &quot;specials&quot; which were activated by the right mouse button or by accessing the ability on a toolbar. In addition to providing high-damage attacks, specials were also used to heal, buff, debuff, and crowd control enemies. Players gained the ability to use more powerful weapons as they advanced in level. Players also earned &quot;Expertise Points&quot; as they leveled up, which were used to advance their professions. The player could allot 45 points to various abilities and attributes, from weapons specialties to healing and armor proficiency. Once a character reached level 90, they would gain access to collaborative &quot;Heroic&quot; missions. The five heroic missions were: Tusken Invasion, IG88, Axkva Min, Imperial Star Destroyer, and Exar Kun.

=== In-Game Economy, Infrastructure, and Political Structure ===
Characters could erect, own, and decorate a variety of communal, personal, and governmental buildings. These buildings, when grouped, could be organized into cities. Players held elections via ballot box for Mayor. Elected mayors granted city members permission to place structures within the city. Elections were held every three weeks. If another player wished to run for mayor, they would add their name to the ballot box to run against the incumbent. As cities grew in population, they became eligible to add services and facilities such as vehicle repair garages, shuttle ports, cloning facilities, hospitals, cantinas, and garden displays. They could show up on planet maps alongside canonical cities such as Theed and Mos Eisley.

The gameplay design aimed towards realistic social institutions like a dynamic virtual economy and other real-life social phenomena like a complicated division of labor. In this virtual economy, players were responsible for creating many in-game items including blasters, starships, clothing, armor, food, housing, furniture and even a wide variety of droids. According to &quot;Star Wars Galaxies and the Division of Labor&quot;, the division of labor in &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; produced in-game results similar to those in real life.

==Setting==
The game events were set following the destruction of the Death Star in &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;, but before the beginning of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

The game launched with 10 planets: Tatooine, Naboo, Corellia, Talus, Rori, Dantooine, Lok, Yavin 4, the Forest Moon of Endor, and Dathomir. The paid expansions added Kashyyyk and Mustafar. There were 12 space zones, encompassing approximately 3400 cubic kilometers of navigable space. Nine space zones were associated with one or more of the playable planets, but Kessel, Ord Mantell, and Deep Space were solely used for space gameplay and player-versus-player combat. The planet Hoth was added in November 2008, but could only be explored during the events of the Battle of Echo Base.

=== Notable Characters and Locations ===
Players could meet many characters from the main and expanded universe of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

The main characters include: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Emperor Palpatine, Admiral Ackbar, Jan Dodonna, Boba Fett, Jabba, Borvo the Hutt, Bib Fortuna, Salacious Crumb, General Otto, Captain Panaka (appears as Colonel Panaka), Max Rebo, Wedge Antilles, Gavyn Sykes, Watto, Boss Nass, Grand Inquisitor Ja&#x27;ce Yiaso, the &quot;reincarnation&quot; of General Grievous as NK-Necrosis, Taga Olak, Jefa Bowa, and the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Other characters and locations that players could visit within the game include: R2-D2, C-3PO, their escape pod on Tatooine, the Naboo Royal Palace, the abandoned Rebel bases on Dantooine and Yavin 4, Ewoks, and Rancors.

==Production==
The game was announced in 2000, when LucasArts Entertainment began a partnership with EverQuest creators Verant Interactive Inc. and Sony Online Entertainment to create a massively multiplayer &quot;Star Wars&quot; online role-playing game. The announcement included an expected release date of 2001 and that the game would take place during the original trilogy era.

On 17 May 2001, before the game went into public beta testing, the first expansion&#x27;s development was announced. The release date of the base game was delayed to the second half of 2002. The creators announced a staggered released schedule for the space-based gameplay A new official website was also released on the same day. It included screenshots, movies, an updated frequently-asked questions section, concept art, development team member&#x27;s profiles, features about the game, and a forum. The site reached 100,001 users by December 2001. Throughout the next year, new content would be posted on the website. This content included information on species and locations, new images and movies of game elements, and 360-degree QuickTime VR panoramas of different in-game locations.

The closed beta test began in July 2002. SOE shared information about the game on the website as the beta progressed. LucasArts also stated in 2002 that both the Xbox and PlayStation 2 would get a version of the game; however, both versions were cancelled.

The game was intended to be released on 15 April 2003. The creators announced on 20 December 2002, that the base game of &quot;Galaxies&quot; would be called An Empire Divided and that the game&#x27;s online community had grown to over 400,000 users since its inception in November 2000. At the time, this represented one of the largest ever fan communities amassed for any game prior to retail availability.

==Release and continued development==
The base game, titled &quot;Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided&quot;, was released on 26 June 2003, in the US and on 7 November 2003, in Europe. A localized version for the Japanese market was published by EA Japan on 23 December 2004. Japanese acceptance of the game was low, and in November 2005 the servers were shut down and existing accounts migrated to US servers.

===Server closures===
On 16 September 2009, SOE informed all current and past account holders of the forthcoming closure of 12 servers (galaxies): Corbantis, Europe-Infinity, Intrepid, Kauri, Kettemoor, Lowca, Naritus, Scylla, Tarquinas, Tempest, Valcyn and Wanderhome. Character creation on these servers was disabled on 15 September 2009, with the final closure of the servers on 15 October 2009. Players with characters on the affected servers were offered free character transfer to one of the 13 remaining servers.

===Hacking incident===
On 3 May 2011, SOE issued a press release stating that all SOE had been isolated from the Internet, due to massive and widespread security infiltrations of various games, servers, and databases. Security teams (and the FBI) were called. Initial reports indicated personal data and of 20-30 million customers outside of the United States from 2007 had potentially been compromised. On 14 May 2011, SOE declared data was safe and reopened all servers. SOE offered a free 30-day membership for established members, an in-game decoration, and a 1:1 ratio of days lost.

===Closure===
On 24 June 2011, SOE and LucasArts announced that they had mutually agreed to shut down &quot;Galaxies&quot; on 15 December 2011. According to the SOE announcement, &quot;If you are an active subscriber in good standing as of September 15, 2011, then you can play for free for the final months. Players wishing to play through the end of the game and participate in the galaxy-ending event planned for the last week of live service in December will need to re-activate or join the game on or before September 15. No new or reactivated accounts will be accepted after September 15, 2011.&quot;

On 15 December 2011, at 9:01 PM Pacific time, the servers of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; shut down, disconnecting those still playing and preventing entry into the game. The final five hours were broadcast in a live stream by Giant Bomb, with Kotaku reporting events as they happened. The final in-game events included a final player versus player finale between the Galactic Empire and The Rebels, as well as an appearance from the Force Ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi as depicted in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

==Reception and subscriptions==
In the United States, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided&quot; sold 370,000 copies ($16.1 million) by August 2006, after its release in June 2003. It was the country&#x27;s 43rd best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;-related games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 720,000 units in the United States.

Reviews for the initial launch of the game in 2003 were mostly positive. The game was praised for its graphics, use of the movie soundtracks, massive world size, character customization, creative creature ecology, complex skill system, player economy interdependencies, and its sandbox approach. Reviewers criticized the overwhelming complexity of the game, combat imbalances of the professions, bugginess, and lack of quest content.

The first player to unlock a &#x27;Jedi slot&#x27; did so on 7 November 2003, four months after the release of the game. Players criticized SOE for the substantial time commitment to unlock a Jedi, penalties for in-game death of a Jedi character (permanent character death after three in-game deaths), and monotonous game play required to acquire the Jedi. Developers responded by changing the penalty for death to skill loss in January 2004 and creating a quest system to unlock the character.

Media outlets criticized the changes of the &quot;Combat Upgrade&quot; while subscription cancellations rose. After the New Game Enhancements were implemented in November 2005, various media outlets criticized the reduced depth and complexity of the game. John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, defended the decision claiming it necessary to revamp the game in order to reverse the deterioration they were seeing in the subscriber base. SOE offered refunds on the &quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot; expansion due to it being released two days before the New Game Enhancement was announced.

Subscriber numbers were originally expected to exceed 1,000,000. In August 2005, SOE reported that they had sold 1,000,000 boxed copies of the game. In early 2006, unconfirmed reports showed that only 10,363 subscribers were playing on a particular Friday night, but Smedley denied that subscriptions had fallen this low.

In an online interview with Reddit in July 2012, John Smedley admitted to &quot;stupid decisions&quot; regarding &quot;Galaxies&quot;&#x27; combat upgrade and new gaming enhancement policies. He acknowledged player led emulator projects seeking to restore a free-to-play &quot;Galaxies&quot; circa April 2005, Publish 14.1, pre-Combat Upgrade, such as the SWGEmu project or Project SWG.

==Legacy==
===Expansions===
====&quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot;====
This first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was released on 27 October 2004. In many ways, this is the spiritual successor to the hit LucasArt&#x27;s space combat flight simulation game &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter&quot;, as the theme, interface and objectives are quite similar.

The reviews for the first expansion, &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot;, praised the new space combat but criticized the base game for its lack of sufficient improvement.

====&quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot;====
The second expansion, Episode III Rage of the Wookiees, was announced on 9 March 2005, and released on 5 May 2005. It added the Wookiee planet of Kashyyyk and its corresponding space sector. Kashyyyk is different from the previous 10 planets: rather than being 16 square kilometers of openly navigable area, it is divided into a small central area with several instanced &quot;dungeon&quot; areas. Other content added in this expansion included: the ability to add cybernetic limbs to a character, resource mining in space, quests for two new creature mounts, and three new starships. A substantial portion of the content for this expansion was adapted from the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; which was released to theaters in the U.S. on 19 May 2005, two weeks after the expansion release.

Customers who purchased the expansion also received a limited-edition Varactyl pet as a player mount. &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot; expansion also added a few quests, one allowed the player to obtain a pet Bolotaur after going through several tasks. The Bolotaur is similar to the Veractyl but larger and brown.

The reviews for the second expansion, &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot;, lauded the new quest content for current subscribers, but lamented the combat gameplay updates and the continued bugginess of the game.

====&quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot;====
The third expansion, Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, was announced on 19 August 2005, and released on 1 November 2005. This expansion added the ground planet of Mustafar to the game. Like the previous expansion, the content is related to &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, which was released to DVD on the same day as the expansion was released. Additional content, including the presence of the droid HK-47, is based on the &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; games.

One week after its release, the character development process was revamped through the New Game Enhancements (NGE). This led to a number of players demanding their money back for the expansion. After a week or two of protests, Sony offered refunds to anyone who asked for it, but many players left the game.

===&quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; compilations===
On top of the expansions, SOE released several compilations of their games:

;&quot;Star Wars Galaxies - The Total Experience&quot;
:This pack included the original &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; (&quot;An Empire Divided&quot;), &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot; and the &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot; expansion packs. Customers who bought this pack also received a BARC speeder as a gift.

;&quot;Star Wars Galaxies - Starter Kit&quot;
:The kit was the first version of the New Game Enhancement (NGE). It contained &quot;An Empire Divided&quot; and &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot;. Customers who bought this pack also received an X-wing or TIE fighter instant transport vehicle as a gift.

;&quot;Star Wars Galaxies - The Complete Online Adventures&quot;
:This included the original game with the first three expansion packs, a DVD of never-before released bonus features, a slide show of more than 800 pieces of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; concept art, screenshots, excerpts from the popular &quot;From Pencil to Pixel&quot; book that chronicles the art of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; and interviews with the producers, and all the cinematic trailers for the game. It also included an exclusive in-game item for use while playing: a personal AT-RT vehicle as seen in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. This version was the first to be released in Australia, instead of &quot;An Empire Divided&quot;.

;&quot;Star Wars Galaxies - The Complete Online Adventures Premium Digital Download&quot;
:This included &quot;An Empire Divided&quot;, &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot;, &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot;, &quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot;, and players who purchase it also receive a bonus instant travel vehicle, the Queen Amidala Transport Ship and an AT-RT walker. No disc media is provided as it is an Internet download, which later came with a Queen Amidala Transport Ship (one per character), a General Grievous Wheel Bike, a Double seated Bike for the player and a friend (one per character), a Lava Flea mount (one per account), an Underground Mustafar Bunker player house (one per account), an AT-RT walker mount (one per account), a Varactyl mount (one per account).

===Novelization===
&quot;Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine&quot; is a novel based in part on places and events in the game. It was authored by Voronica Whitney-Robinson and Haden Blackman, the LucasArts producer of the game. It was released in December 2003.

===&quot;Trading Card Game&quot;===
On 27 August 2008, following the success of SOE&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Norrath&quot;, LucasArts and SOE released &quot;Champions of the Force&quot;, an online trading card game based on &quot;Galaxies&quot;. In the game, players could collect, battle, and trade with each other they could also buy new cards and get in-game items. Over one hundred cards were created for players to find and play against others with new artwork featured on each card.

=== Emulation ===

In 2004, the SWGEmu project was founded with the intention of re-creating the Pre-Combat Upgrade version of &quot;Galaxies&quot; from scratch through emulation. The goal of SWGEmu is to emulate the game to its entirety as it was on the live servers through patch 14.1. In 2020, the SWGEmu project announced it was near completion of the base game (colloquially referred to as version 1.0). They also announced that Jump to Lightspeed may no longer be included in version 1.0 due to the complexities of implementing the system. SWGEmu is an open source project distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License. The server code base, known as Core3, has been open source since before 2010, allowing for volunteers to easily contribute to its development. In 2019, SWGEmu also open sourced its engine, known as Engine3. Because SWGEmu is open source, any members are able to easily launch their own server for their own community. There are several community-run servers which develop content beyond the 14.1 publish goal of SWGEmu, such as Awakening, Dark Rebellion, Empire in Flames, Infinity and Reckoning. Other projects like CUEmu look to use SWGEmu&#x27;s Core3 code base to emulate the publish 15 era of &quot;Galaxies&quot;, also known as the Combat Upgrade.

In 2011, after SOE announced the intention of shutting down Star Wars Galaxies, Project SWG was founded to emulate the NGE version of Star Wars Galaxies. Project SWG has not been as objectively successful as SWGEmu and has undergone multiple refactors of their code since conception. Their current server, Holocore, is still under development by a small team and is several years away from completion.

Both SWGEmu and Project SWG are regarded as the primary emulation projects for &quot;Galaxies&quot; with other communities utilizing their source code to run their own server, sometimes contributing specific code to create their own content or by using shared content from resources such as ModTheGalaxy, a game modification distribution forum. Some player-made tools created while &quot;Galaxies&quot; was live, such as SWGCraft and GalaxyHarvester, and are running with connections to hosted servers.

=== Source code leak ===
In 2013, a former SOE employee leaked a copy of the 2010 production release source code for the &quot;Galaxies&quot; client, server, 3rd party libraries, and development tools to a few former players involved with the NGE &quot;Galaxies&quot; emulator Project SWG. The code was later leaked beyond its intended recipients and made available online.

<text>Andrzej Biegalski (5 March 1953 – 14 March 2017) was a Polish heavyweight amateur boxing champion. He reached the quarterfinal round in the World Championships in Havana, 1974.

Biegalski&#x27;s greatest success came with gold in European Championship in Katowice, Poland, June 1975 when he beat Peter Hussing from Germany by a heavy KO. However, he was not able to follow that success with more achievement due to overexploitation. During 1976 Summer Olympics, he lost his first bout to John Tate. He also participated in the European Championship in 1979.

Biegalski was a three time national champion in 1974 and in 1978 in a heavyweight division, and in 1979 in a superheavyweight competition.

Later in life he was also involved in politics.

<text>Radiation protection, also known as radiological protection, is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as &quot;The protection of people from harmful effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, and the means for achieving this&quot;. Exposure can be from a source of radiation external to the human body or due to internal irradiation caused by the ingestion of radioactive contamination.

Ionizing radiation is widely used in industry and medicine, and can present a significant health hazard by causing microscopic damage to living tissue. There are two main categories of ionizing radiation health effects. At high exposures, it can cause &quot;tissue&quot; effects, also called &quot;deterministic&quot; effects due to the certainty of them happening, conventionally indicated by the unit gray and resulting in acute radiation syndrome. For low level exposures there can be statistically elevated risks of radiation-induced cancer, called &quot;stochastic effects&quot; due to the uncertainty of them happening, conventionally indicated by the unit sievert.

Fundamental to radiation protection is the avoidance or reduction of dose using the simple protective measures of time, distance and shielding. The duration of exposure should be limited to that necessary, the distance from the source of radiation should be maximised, and the source or the target shielded wherever possible. To measure personal dose uptake in occupational or emergency exposure, for external radiation personal dosimeters are used, and for internal dose due to ingestion of radioactive contamination, bioassay techniques are applied.

For radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) publish recommendations and data which is used to calculate the biological effects on the human body of certain levels of radiation, and thereby advise acceptable dose uptake limits.

==Principles==

The ICRP recommends, develops and maintains the International System of Radiological Protection, based on evaluation of the large body of scientific studies available to equate risk to received dose levels. The system&#x27;s health objectives are &quot;to manage and control exposures to ionising radiation so that deterministic effects are prevented, and the risks of stochastic effects are reduced to the extent reasonably achievable&quot;.

The ICRP&#x27;s recommendations flow down to national and regional regulators, which have the opportunity to incorporate them into their own law; this process is shown in the accompanying block diagram. In most countries a national regulatory authority works towards ensuring a secure radiation environment in society by setting dose limitation requirements that are generally based on the recommendations of the ICRP.

===Exposure situations===
The ICRP recognises planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, as described below;
* Planned exposure – defined as &quot;...where radiological protection can be planned in advance, before exposures occur, and where the magnitude and extent of the exposures can be reasonably predicted.&quot; These are such as in occupational exposure situations, where it is necessary for personnel to work in a known radiation environment. 
* Emergency exposure – defined as &quot;...unexpected situations that may require urgent protective actions&quot;. This would be such as an emergency nuclear event. 
* Existing exposure – defined as &quot;...being those that already exist when a decision on control has to be taken&quot;. These can be such as from naturally occurring radioactive materials which exist in the environment.

===Regulation of dose uptake===
The ICRP uses the following overall principles for all controllable exposure situations. 
* Justification: No unnecessary use of radiation is permitted, which means that the advantages must outweigh the disadvantages. 
* Limitation: Each individual must be protected against risks that are too great, through the application of individual radiation dose limits.
* Optimization: This process is intended for application to those situations that have been deemed to be justified. It means &quot;the likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses&quot; should all be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (or Reasonably Practicable) known as ALARA or ALARP. It takes into account economic and societal factors.

===Factors in external dose uptake===

There are three factors that control the amount, or dose, of radiation received from a source. Radiation exposure can be managed by a combination of these factors:
#Time: Reducing the time of an exposure reduces the effective dose proportionally. An example of reducing radiation doses by reducing the time of exposures might be improving operator training to reduce the time they take to handle a radioactive source.
#Distance: Increasing distance reduces dose due to the inverse square law. Distance can be as simple as handling a source with forceps rather than fingers. For example, if a problem arises during fluoroscopic procedure step away from the patient if feasible.
#Shielding: Sources of radiation can be shielded with solid or liquid material, which absorbs the energy of the radiation. The term &#x27;biological shield&#x27; is used for absorbing material placed around a nuclear reactor, or other source of radiation, to reduce the radiation to a level safe for humans. The shielding materials are concrete and lead shield which is 0.25 mm thick for secondary radiation and 0.5 mm thick for primary radiation

===Internal dose uptake===
Internal dose, due to the inhalation or ingestion of radioactive substances, can result in stochastic or deterministic effects, depending on the amount of radioactive material ingested and other biokinetic factors.

The risk from a low level internal source is represented by the dose quantity committed dose, which has the same risk as the same amount of external effective dose.

The intake of radioactive material can occur through four pathways:
*inhalation of airborne contaminants such as radon gas and radioactive particles
*ingestion of radioactive contamination in food or liquids
*absorption of vapours such as tritium oxide through the skin
*injection of medical radioisotopes such as technetium-99m

The occupational hazards from airborne radioactive particles in nuclear and radio-chemical applications are greatly reduced by the extensive use of gloveboxes to contain such material. To protect against breathing in radioactive particles in ambient air, respirators with particulate filters are worn.

To monitor the concentration of radioactive particles in ambient air, radioactive particulate monitoring instruments measure the concentration or presence of airborne materials.

For ingested radioactive materials in food and drink, specialist laboratory radiometric assay methods are used to measure the concentration of such materials.

=== Recommended limits on dose uptake ===
The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of ICRP report 103. These limits are &quot;situational&quot;, for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for certain exposed groups;
* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public exposure. The occupational exposure limit of effective dose is 20 mSv per year, averaged over defined periods of 5 years, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. The public exposure limit is 1 mSv in a year.
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – reference levels for all persons exposed

The public information dose chart of the USA Department of Energy, shown here on the right, applies to USA regulation, which is based on ICRP recommendations. Note that examples in lines 1 to 4 have a scale of dose rate (radiation per unit time), whilst 5 and 6 have a scale of total accumulated dose.

===ALARP &amp; ALARA===

ALARP is an acronym for an important principle in exposure to radiation and other occupational health risks and in the UK stands for As Low As Reasonably Practicable. The aim is to minimize the risk of radioactive exposure or other hazard while keeping in mind that some exposure may be acceptable in order to further the task at hand. The equivalent term ALARA, As Low As Reasonably Achievable, is more commonly used outside the UK.

This compromise is well illustrated in radiology. The application of radiation can aid the patient by providing doctors and other health care professionals with a medical diagnosis, but the exposure of the patient should be reasonably low enough to keep the statistical probability of cancers or sarcomas (stochastic effects) below an acceptable level, and to eliminate deterministic effects (e.g. skin reddening or cataracts). An acceptable level of incidence of stochastic effects is considered to be equal for a worker to the risk in other radiation work generally considered to be safe.

This policy is based on the principle that any amount of radiation exposure, no matter how small, can increase the chance of negative biological effects such as cancer. It is also based on the principle that the probability of the occurrence of negative effects of radiation exposure increases with cumulative lifetime dose. These ideas are combined to form the linear no-threshold model which says that there is not a threshold at which there is an increase in the rate of occurrence of stochastic effects with increasing dose. At the same time, radiology and other practices that involve use of ionizing radiation bring benefits, so reducing radiation exposure can reduce the efficacy of a medical practice. The economic cost, for example of adding a barrier against radiation, must also be considered when applying the ALARP principle. Computed tomography, better known as CT scans or CAT scans have made an enormous contribution to medicine, however not without some risk. The ionizing radiation used in CT scans can lead to radiation-induced cancer. Age is a significant factor in risk associated with CT scans, and in procedures involving children and systems that do not require extensive imaging, lower doses are used.

==Personal radiation dosimeters==

The radiation dosimeter is an important personal dose measuring instrument. It is worn by the person being monitored and is used to estimate the external radiation dose deposited in the individual wearing the device. They are used for gamma, X-ray, beta and other strongly penetrating radiation, but not for weakly penetrating radiation such as alpha particles. Traditionally, film badges were used for long-term monitoring, and quartz fibre dosimeters for short-term monitoring. However, these have been mostly superseded by thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) badges and electronic dosimeters. Electronic dosimeters can give an alarm warning if a preset dose threshold has been reached, enabling safer working in potentially higher radiation levels, where the received dose must be continually monitored.

Workers exposed to radiation, such as radiographers, nuclear power plant workers, doctors using radiotherapy, those in laboratories using radionuclides, and HAZMAT teams are required to wear dosimeters so a record of occupational exposure can be made. Such devices are generally termed &quot;legal dosimeters&quot; if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes.

Dosimeters can be worn to obtain a whole body dose and there are also specialist types that can be worn on the fingers or clipped to headgear, to measure the localised body irradiation for specific activities.

Common types of wearable dosimeters for ionizing radiation include:
* Film badge dosimeter
* Quartz fibre dosimeter
* Electronic personal dosimeter
* Thermoluminescent dosimeter

==Radiation protection==

Almost any material can act as a shield from gamma or x-rays if used in sufficient amounts. Different types of ionizing radiation interact in different ways with shielding material. The effectiveness of shielding is dependent on stopping power, which varies with the type and energy of radiation and the shielding material used. Different shielding techniques are therefore used depending on the application and the type and energy of the radiation.

Shielding reduces the intensity of radiation, increasing with thickness. This is an exponential relationship with gradually diminishing effect as equal slices of shielding material are added. A quantity known as the halving-thicknesses is used to calculate this. For example, a practical shield in a fallout shelter with ten halving-thicknesses of packed dirt, which is roughly , reduces gamma rays to 1/1024 of their original intensity (i.e. 2−10).

The effectiveness of a shielding material in general increases with its atomic number, called &quot;Z&quot;, except for neutron shielding, which is more readily shielded by the likes of neutron absorbers and moderators such as compounds of boron e.g. boric acid, cadmium, carbon and hydrogen.

Graded-&quot;Z&quot; shielding is a laminate of several materials with different &quot;Z&quot; values (atomic numbers) designed to protect against ionizing radiation. Compared to single-material shielding, the same mass of graded-&quot;Z&quot; shielding has been shown to reduce electron penetration over 60%. It is commonly used in satellite-based particle detectors, offering several benefits:
* protection from radiation damage
* reduction of background noise for detectors
* lower mass compared to single-material shielding

Designs vary, but typically involve a gradient from high-&quot;Z&quot; (usually tantalum) through successively lower-&quot;Z&quot; elements such as tin, steel, and copper, usually ending with aluminium. Sometimes even lighter materials such as polypropylene or boron carbide are used.

In a typical graded-&quot;Z&quot; shield, the high-&quot;Z&quot; layer effectively scatters protons and electrons. It also absorbs gamma rays, which produces X-ray fluorescence. Each subsequent layer absorbs the X-ray fluorescence of the previous material, eventually reducing the energy to a suitable level. Each decrease in energy produces Bremsstrahlung and Auger electrons, which are below the detector&#x27;s energy threshold. Some designs also include an outer layer of aluminium, which may simply be the skin of the satellite. The effectiveness of a material as a biological shield is related to its cross-section for scattering and absorption, and to a first approximation is proportional to the total mass of material per unit area interposed along the line of sight between the radiation source and the region to be protected. Hence, shielding strength or &quot;thickness&quot; is conventionally measured in units of g/cm2. The radiation that manages to get through falls exponentially with the thickness of the shield. In x-ray facilities, walls surrounding the room with the x-ray generator may contain lead shielding such as lead sheets, or the plaster may contain barium sulfate. Operators view the target through a leaded glass screen, or if they must remain in the same room as the target, wear lead aprons.

===Particle radiation===
Particle radiation consists of a stream of charged or neutral particles, both charged ions and subatomic elementary particles. This includes solar wind, cosmic radiation, and neutron flux in nuclear reactors.
* Alpha particles (helium nuclei) are the least penetrating. Even very energetic alpha particles can be stopped by a single sheet of paper.
* Beta particles (electrons) are more penetrating, but still can be absorbed by a few millimetres of aluminium. However, in cases where high-energy beta particles are emitted, shielding must be accomplished with low atomic weight materials, &quot;e.g.&quot; plastic, wood, water, or acrylic glass (Plexiglas, Lucite). This is to reduce generation of Bremsstrahlung X-rays. In the case of beta+ radiation (positrons), the gamma radiation from the electron–positron annihilation reaction poses additional concern.
* Neutron radiation is not as readily absorbed as charged particle radiation, which makes this type highly penetrating. In a process called neutron activation, neutrons are absorbed by nuclei of atoms in a nuclear reaction. This most often creates a secondary radiation hazard, as the absorbing nuclei transmute to the next-heavier isotope, many of which are unstable.
* Cosmic radiation is not a common concern on Earth, as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorbs it and the magnetosphere acts as a shield, but it poses a significant problem for satellites and astronauts, especially while passing through the Van Allen Belt or while completely outside the protective regions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. Frequent fliers may be at a slightly higher risk because of the decreased absorption from thinner atmosphere. Cosmic radiation is extremely high energy, and is very penetrating.

===Electromagnetic radiation===
Electromagnetic radiation consists of emissions of electromagnetic waves, the properties of which depend on the wavelength.
* X-ray and gamma radiation are best absorbed by atoms with heavy nuclei; the heavier the nucleus, the better the absorption. In some special applications, depleted uranium or thorium are used, but lead is much more common; several cm are often required. Barium sulfate is used in some applications too. However, when the cost is important, almost any material can be used, but it must be far thicker. Most nuclear reactors use thick concrete shields to create a bioshield with a thin water-cooled layer of lead on the inside to protect the porous concrete from the coolant inside. The concrete is also made with heavy aggregates, such as Baryte or Magnetite, to aid in the shielding properties of the concrete. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray.
* Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is ionizing in its shortest wavelengths but is not penetrating, so it can be shielded by thin opaque layers such as sunscreen, clothing, and protective eyewear. Protection from UV is simpler than for the other forms of radiation above, so it is often considered separately.
In some cases, improper shielding can actually make the situation worse, when the radiation interacts with the shielding material and creates secondary radiation that absorbs in the organisms more readily. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding photons, using them to shield beta particles may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of Bremsstrahlung x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using a material with a high neutron activation cross section to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.

== Personal protective equipment==
Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and accessories which can be worn to prevent severe illness and injury as a result of exposure to radioactive material. These include an SR100 (protection for 1hr), SR200 (protection for 2 hours). Because radiation can affect humans through internal and external contamination, various protection strategies have been developed to protect humans from the harmful effects of radiation exposure from a spectrum of sources. A few of these strategies developed to shield from internal, external, and high energy radiation are outlined below.

=== Internal contamination protective equipment ===
Internal contamination protection equipment protects against the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Internal deposition of radioactive material result in direct exposure of radiation to organs and tissues inside the body. The respiratory protective equipment described below are designed to minimize the possibility of such material being inhaled or ingested as emergency workers are exposed to potentially radioactive environments.

Reusable air purifying respirators (APR)
* Elastic face piece worn over the mouth and nose
* Contains filters, cartridges, and canisters to provide increased protection and better filtration

Powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR)
* Battery powered blower forces contamination through air purifying filters
* Purified air delivered under positive pressure to face piece

Supplied-air respirator (SAR)
* Compressed air delivered from a stationary source to the face piece

Auxiliary escape respirator
* Protects wearer from breathing harmful gases, vapours, fumes, and dust
* Can be designed as an air-purifying escape respirator (APER) or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) type respirator
* SCBA type escape respirators have an attached source of breathing air and a hood that provides a barrier against contaminated outside air

Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)
* Provides very pure, dry compressed air to full facepiece mask via a hose
* Air is exhaled to environment
* Worn when entering environments immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) or when information is inadequate to rule out IDLH atmosphere

=== External contamination protective equipment ===
External contamination protection equipment provides a barrier to shield radioactive material from being deposited externally on the body or clothes. The dermal protective equipment described below acts as a barrier to block radioactive material from physically touching the skin, but does not protect against externally penetrating high energy radiation.

Chemical-resistant inner suit
* Porous overall suit—Dermal protection from aerosols, dry particles, and non hazardous liquids.
* Non-porous overall suit to provide dermal protection from: 
** Dry powders and solids
** Blood-borne pathogens and bio-hazards
** Chemical splashes and inorganic acid/base aerosols
** Mild liquid chemical splashes from toxics and corrosives
** Toxic industrial chemicals and materials

Level C equivalent: Bunker gear
* Firefighter protective clothing
* Flame/water resistant
* Helmet, gloves, foot gear, and hood

Level B equivalent: Non-gas-tight encapsulating suit
* Designed for environments that are immediate health risks but contain no substances that can be absorbed by skin

Level A equivalent: Totally encapsulating chemical- and vapour-protective suit
* Designed for environments that are immediate health risks and contain substances that can be absorbed by skin

=== External penetrating radiation ===
There are many solutions to shielding against low-energy radiation exposure like low-energy X-rays. Lead shielding wear such as lead aprons can protect patients and clinicians from the potentially harmful radiation effects of day-to-day medical examinations. It is quite feasible to protect large surface areas of the body from radiation in the lower-energy spectrum because very little shielding material is required to provide the necessary protection. Recent studies show that copper shielding is far more effective than lead and is likely to replace it as the standard material for radiation shielding.

Personal shielding against more energetic radiation such as gamma radiation is very difficult to achieve as the large mass of shielding material required to properly protect the entire body would make functional movement nearly impossible. For this, partial body shielding of radio-sensitive internal organs is the most viable protection strategy.

The immediate danger of intense exposure to high-energy gamma radiation is acute radiation syndrome (ARS), a result of irreversible bone marrow damage. The concept of selective shielding is based in the regenerative potential of the hematopoietic stem cells found in bone marrow. The regenerative quality of stem cells make it only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the body with unaffected stem cells after the exposure: a similar concept which is applied in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is a common treatment for patients with leukemia. This scientific advancement allows for the development of a new class of relatively lightweight protective equipment that shields high concentrations of bone marrow to defer the hematopoietic sub-syndrome of acute radiation syndrome to much higher dosages.

One technique is to apply selective shielding to protect the high concentration of bone marrow stored in the hips and other radio-sensitive organs in the abdominal area. This allows first responders a safe way to perform necessary missions in radioactive environments.

==Radiation protection instruments==
Practical radiation measurement using calibrated radiation protection instruments is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of protection measures, and in assessing the radiation dose likely to be received by individuals. The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both &quot;installed&quot; (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable).

===Installed instruments===
Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed &quot;area&quot; radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne particulate monitors.

The area radiation monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations that can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area.

Gamma radiation &quot;interlock monitors&quot; are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present. These interlock the process access directly.

Airborne contamination monitors measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the ambient air to guard against radioactive particles being ingested, or deposited in the lungs of personnel. These instruments will normally give a local alarm, but are often connected to an integrated safety system so that areas of plant can be evacuated and personnel are prevented from entering an air of high airborne contamination.

Personnel exit monitors (PEM) are used to monitor workers who are exiting a &quot;contamination controlled&quot; or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any radioactive contamination has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

The UK National Physical Laboratory publishes a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.

===Portable instruments===
Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable. The hand-held instrument is generally used as a survey meter to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations.

In the United Kingdom the HSE has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide.

===Instrument types===
A number of commonly used detection instrument types are listed below, and are used for both fixed and survey monitoring.
*ionization chambers
*proportional counters
*Geiger counters
*semiconductor detectors
*scintillation detectors
*airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring

==Radiation related quantities==
The following table shows the main radiation-related quantities and units.

==Spacecraft radiation challenges==
Spacecraft, both robotic and crewed, must cope with the high radiation environment of outer space. Radiation emitted by the Sun and other galactic sources, and trapped in radiation &quot;belts&quot; is more dangerous and hundreds of times more intense than radiation sources such as medical X-rays or normal cosmic radiation usually experienced on Earth. When the intensely ionizing particles found in space strike human tissue, it can result in cell damage and may eventually lead to cancer.

The usual method for radiation protection is material shielding by spacecraft and equipment structures (usually aluminium), possibly augmented by polyethylene in human spaceflight where the main concern is high-energy protons and cosmic ray ions. On uncrewed spacecraft in high-electron-dose environments such as Jupiter missions, or medium Earth orbit (MEO), additional shielding with materials of a high atomic number can be effective. On long-duration crewed missions, advantage can be taken of the good shielding characteristics of liquid hydrogen fuel and water.

The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory makes use of a particle accelerator that produces beams of protons or heavy ions. These ions are typical of those accelerated in cosmic sources and by the Sun. The beams of ions move through a 100 m (328-foot) transport tunnel to the 37 m2 (400-square-foot) shielded target hall. There, they hit the target, which may be a biological sample or shielding material. In a 2002 NASA study, it was determined that materials that have high hydrogen contents, such as polyethylene, can reduce primary and secondary radiation to a greater extent than metals, such as aluminum. The problem with this &quot;passive shielding&quot; method is that radiation interactions in the material generate secondary radiation.

Active Shielding, that is, using magnets, high voltages, or artificial magnetospheres to slow down or deflect radiation, has been considered to potentially combat radiation in a feasible way. So far, the cost of equipment, power and weight of active shielding equipment outweigh their benefits. For example, active radiation equipment would need a habitable volume size to house it, and magnetic and electrostatic configurations often are not homogeneous in intensity, allowing high-energy particles to penetrate the magnetic and electric fields from low-intensity parts, like cusps in dipolar magnetic field of Earth. As of 2012, NASA is undergoing research in superconducting magnetic architecture for potential active shielding applications.

==Early radiation dangers==
The dangers of radioactivity and radiation were not immediately recognized. The discovery of x‑rays in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of Vanderbilt University performed an experiment involving x-raying Dudley&#x27;s head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, of his severe hand and chest burns in an x-ray demonstration, was the first of many other reports in &quot;Electrical Review&quot;.

Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Thomas Edison&#x27;s lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and experienced pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects, including ultraviolet rays and ozone were sometimes blamed for the damage. Many physicists claimed that there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.

As early as 1902 William Herbert Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in careless use of x-rays was not being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time Rollins had proved that x-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a fetus. He also stressed that &quot;animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light&quot; and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of x-rays.

Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicists and corporations began marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine in the form of glow-in-the-dark pigments. Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died from aplastic anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium-containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market (radioactive quackery).

<text>Guy Damien Lafleur (September 20, 1951 – April 22, 2022), nicknamed &quot;the Flower&quot; and &quot;Le Démon Blond&quot;, was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He was the first player in National Hockey League (NHL) history to score 50 goals in six consecutive seasons as well as 50 goals and 100 points in six consecutive seasons. Between 1971 and 1991, Lafleur played right wing for the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Quebec Nordiques in an NHL career spanning 17 seasons, and five Stanley Cup championships in 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 (all with the Canadiens). Lafleur was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988, named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history in 2017, and was named to the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2022.

==Early life==
Lafleur was born on September 20, 1951, in Thurso, Quebec. He started playing hockey at the age of five after receiving his first hockey stick as a Christmas present.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career===
As a youth, he played at the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament three consecutive years from 1962 to 1964, and scored a tournament record of 64 points. In his teens, Lafleur gained considerable recognition for his play as a member of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he led his team to the Memorial Cup in 1971, scoring 130 regular season goals. At the time, Lafleur idolized Jean Béliveau and Bobby Orr. He gained the nickname &quot;Le Turbo de Thurso&quot; while playing with the Remparts, coined by Radio Canada broadcaster Jean-Bernard Rainville.

===Montreal Canadiens===

====1971 NHL Entry Draft====
With Lafleur and fellow Quebecer Marcel Dionne among the top prospects in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft, the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; general manager, Sam Pollock, was keen to find a way to trade to obtain one of the top two picks. He persuaded California Golden Seals owner Charlie Finley to trade the Seals&#x27; 1971 first-round pick and François Lacombe in return for Montreal&#x27;s 1970 first-round pick and veteran Ernie Hicke. Oakland finished last, leaving Montreal with the first overall pick. Pollock hesitated between Lafleur and Dionne, but chose Lafleur with the first draft choice.

====Dynasty (1971–1979)====
Lafleur wore No. 10, as Beliveau originally asked Lafleur to take his No. 4, then had second thoughts, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t try to be a second Jean Beliveau. Be the first Guy Lafleur. Take a number and make it your own.&quot; Lafleur received little ice time in his rookie season, as the Canadiens were deep in veteran players. During his first three seasons, Lafleur struggled to live up to expectations in the league as he posted average statistics—the more so in that Dionne became an immediate star in Detroit who led his team in scoring over his first three seasons.

By his fourth season, 1974–75, Lafleur had developed his trademark smooth skating style and scoring touch, making him one of the most popular players on a very popular team; fans chanted &quot;Guy, Guy, Guy!&quot; whenever he touched the puck. Lafleur&#x27;s obituary on Sportsnet described him as a &quot;Jackson Pollock painting on ice, a frenetic innovator who pushed the boundaries of his art beyond what had ever been conceived, a singularly dynamic force that turned an everyday sight as simple as a man on skates with a puck on his stick into a masterpiece — something you had seen before, perhaps, but never quite like that&quot;. Opposing players often hooked and slashed Lafleur, but he never retaliated. 
Former teammate Réjean Houle said that “Guy lived 100 miles an hour. One hundred miles an hour everywhere. One hundred miles an hour when he went to Quebec in his car. One hundred miles an hour on the rink. One hundred miles an hour on Crescent St. Besides his on-ice artistry, Lafleur was also known for his charisma as he was frequently in demand with the press and fans, with former Montreal Gazette sports columnist Michael Farber saying “Jean Béliveau was magisterial. Jean Béliveau was our father — and Guy Lafleur was our cool older brother. Lafleur wasn’t a quiet guy and if you look at his era, that was not a quiet time. Lafleur was a product of the ’70s. There were loud colours, loud clothing — we’ve seen pictures of the sideburns&quot;. Those who encountered Lafleur personally lauded his down-to-earth persona and humility. Lafleur became known among English-speaking fans as &quot;the Flower&quot; due to his literal translation of his surname, while among French fans he was dubbed &quot;le Démon Blond&quot; (the Blond Demon). He was one of several players nicknamed &quot;the Flying Frenchman&quot;.

Lafleur was a cornerstone of the Canadiens&#x27; four straight Stanley Cup championships from 1976 to 1979, including being named playoff MVP in 1977. During the 1978 Stanley Cup finals, Boston Bruins head coach Don Cherry ordered his players to put their sticks up and hit Lafleur whenever they encountered him. At the end of the series, Lafleur&#x27;s head was swathed in bandages after numerous slashes from Bruin players. After Montreal won the Stanley Cup, he borrowed it for the weekend without telling anyone to show his friends back home in Thurso, where he set it out on his front lawn for all his neighbours to see.

In 1979, Lafleur released the album &quot;Lafleur!&quot;, consisting of Guy Lafleur reciting hockey instructions, accompanied by disco music.

====Decline and first retirement (1980–1985)====
With Ken Dryden, Jacques Lemaire, and several other key players retiring after the conclusion of the 1979 season, the Canadiens&#x27; dynasty came to an end with the team losing in the second round of the 1980 playoffs to the Minnesota North Stars in seven games. Injuries shortened Lafleur&#x27;s 1980–81 season and his production dropped significantly (during the previous six seasons, Lafleur had reached or exceeded 100 points and 50 goals). In the following seasons, he was overshadowed by Mike Bossy and Wayne Gretzky.

While driving home on March 24, 1981, Lafleur fell asleep at the wheel of his Cadillac and crashed into a highway fence. A metal post pierced the windshield, missing his head by an inch while grazing his right ear. During the 1980–81 season, Lafleur appeared in only 51 games and scored 27 goals. It was the first time since the 1973–74 season that he failed to score 50 goals or more in a season. The Canadiens&#x27; next three seasons would all end with shock first round exits: a first round sweep by Gretzky&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers, a loss in the fifth and deciding game to Montreal&#x27;s provincial rival Quebec Nordiques, and another three-game sweep at the hands of the Buffalo Sabres.

The 1983–84 season produced Montreal&#x27;s first losing record of the expansion era, and resulted in coach Bob Berry being replaced 63 games into the season by Lafleur&#x27;s former teammate Jacques Lemaire. At first, Lemaire&#x27;s hiring was seen as a success as he guided the Canadiens to their first playoff series victories since 1980 and reached the Wales Conference Final. Though the Canadiens&#x27; new coach had been Lafleur&#x27;s centreman during many of the glory years of the 1970s, the former linemates quickly struggled to transform their relationship to an amicable one between coach and player. In time, Lemaire became renowned as one of the NHL&#x27;s finest defensively-minded coaches. Lafleur was always an offensive-minded player who believed his productivity overshadowed any defensive weaknesses. Lemaire&#x27;s insistence that everyone on his teams contribute defensively promptly caused a rift between him and Lafleur that never healed. By 1985, due to a rocky relationship with Lemaire, Lafleur felt this had become intolerable and requested a trade. General manager Serge Savard refused Lafleur&#x27;s request, as trading one of the most popular players in Canadiens history would have incurred a severe backlash from fans and the media. With no other options, Lafleur decided to retire, and his departure from the Canadiens was considered acrimonious.

===Return to the NHL (1988–1991)===
After being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, Lafleur came out of retirement to return to the NHL for three more seasons, from 1988 through 1991, with the New York Rangers and the Quebec Nordiques. Lafleur remained one of the few players who did not wear protective helmets due to a grandfather clause. According to Wayne Gretzky, Lafleur &quot;was quicker and faster without wearing full shoulder pads&quot;.

In July 1988, Yves Tremblay, Lafleur&#x27;s agent and best friend, had an idea. He called Michel Bergeron, New York Rangers&#x27; coach, to ask him if he was interested to get Guy on his team. He contacted also The Penguins, the Red Wings and the Kings. But Bergeron and Phil Esposito, Rangers&#x27; General Manager, called back Tremblay to organize a meeting 2 days later in New York. Lafleur and Tremblay convinced Esposito to sign Lafleur to a one-year contract. During his first game back in the Montreal Forum, he received a standing ovation when he came on the ice, and as in his heyday with the Canadiens, the crowd chanted &quot;Guy! Guy! Guy!&quot; every time he touched the puck. Lafleur scored twice against Patrick Roy, to heavy applause, during the Rangers&#x27; 7–5 loss to the Canadiens, and was awarded the first star of the game. Although his high-scoring days were well behind him, his stint with the Rangers was moderately successful, and he helped the team to first place in the Patrick Division until being knocked out by a knee injury.

Lafleur then followed dismissed Rangers head coach and close friend Michel Bergeron to the Nordiques for his final seasons. Intending to finish his hockey career in Quebec where he had started, Lafleur reportedly turned down a $1 million offer from the Los Angeles Kings which would have allowed him to play alongside Wayne Gretzky. Lafleur managed 24 goals in 98 games with the Nordiques over two seasons, while also mentoring emerging star center Joe Sakic, Despite Lafleur&#x27;s presence, the Nordiques owned the NHL&#x27;s worst record in both seasons Lafleur played with them. During Lafleur&#x27;s final NHL game he was cheered every time he touched the puck and leapt over the boards and received a long standing ovation; the referee for that contest was Paul Stewart (coincidentally Stewart&#x27;s final NHL game as a player was when his Nordiques played against Lafleur&#x27;s Canadiens on April 6, 1980).

The Minnesota North Stars selected Lafleur with the final pick in the 1991 Expansion Draft. Lafleur had decided to retire for a second and last time as a player, and he had already agreed to an off-ice job with the Nordiques. The league&#x27;s bylaws prevented him from accepting a job with a team that did not own his playing rights. The North Stars solved Lafleur&#x27;s quandary by trading him back to Quebec. In exchange, they received the rights to a former Nordique who had been playing in Switzerland for two years, Alan Haworth. Haworth played just one more year of professional hockey, and never returned to the NHL.

==Life after hockey==
Lafleur was a licensed helicopter pilot. He was part owner of a helicopter transportation company. He was the copilot when the Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27;s André Roy proposed to his fiancée, the Stanley Cup serving as the engagement ring bearer.

In the 1990s, Lafleur had his own brand of fruit juice energy drink, &quot;Flower Power&quot;.

Lafleur also owned a restaurant in Berthierville, Quebec, &quot;Guy Lafleur Mikes Signature&quot;, which opened in 2002. He opened a new restaurant, called &quot;Bleu, Blanc, Rouge!&quot; in Rosemère, Quebec, in 2008. Lafleur sold the &quot;Bleu, Blanc Rouge&quot; in December 2012. The restaurant closed on December 22, 2012.

From 2005 to 2008 Lafleur was appointed honorary colonel of 12 Radar Squadron, an air force unit in Bagotville, Quebec. In February 2013 he was appointed honorary colonel of 3 Wing Bagotville, the parent formation of 12 Radar Squadron. Honorary colonels generally serve for three years.

In 2007 Lafleur&#x27;s son Mark was arrested for assault, forcible confinement, and other charges, and remained at his father&#x27;s house as part of his bail conditions. In 2009, Lafleur was charged with giving contradictory testimony about whether Mark had respected his curfew. Lafleur was convicted in 2009, but in August 2010, he was unanimously acquitted of all charges by the Quebec Court of Appeal. He filed a $2.8 million civil suit against police and prosecutors, claiming that his rights were violated and his reputation damaged but did not win his case.

==Illness and death==
In September 2019, Lafleur began having health issues and had open heart surgery with five bypasses. In November 2019, he had a cancerous lobe removed from his left lung. In October 2020, cancer was diagnosed in his right lung.

Lafleur died on April 22, 2022, at age 70, exactly one week after Mike Bossy, who also succumbed to lung cancer (both smoked heavily during their playing days); both were Quebec natives whose contemporary careers as star right-wingers were often compared.

He was given a national funeral on May 3, 2022, in Montreal, Quebec.

==Accolades and legacy==
Lafleur is the all-time leading scorer in Canadiens history, notching 1,246 points, made up of the club&#x27;s second highest (behind Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard) all-time goals, with 518, and the most all-time assists, with 728, in his 14 years with Montreal. He led the NHL in points in 1976, 1977, and 1978. He tied for a Montreal club record with Steve Shutt for goals in a season with 60 in 1977–78 and holds the franchise record for points in a season with 136 in 1976–77. Lafleur became the first player in NHL history to score at least 50 goals and 100 points in six consecutive seasons, all as a Hab. Lafleur was also the fastest player (at the time) to reach 1,000 points, doing so in only 720 games. That record has since been broken by Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and three others.

He was a member of the Canadian team in the 1976 and 1981 Canada Cup tournaments, winning the Cup in 1976. He was the recipient of the Lou Marsh Trophy in 1977.

On February 16, 1985, Lafleur became the fifth player from the Montreal Canadiens to have his sweater number retired. Lafleur was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. Along with Gordie Howe before him and Mario Lemieux after him, Lafleur is one of only three players to have returned to the NHL after being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

In April 2001, Lafleur sold most of his personal hockey memorabilia in a silent auction. 122 items were sold, including miniature replicas of NHL trophies, jerseys, pucks, sticks, and skates. Included in the sale were his 1977 Conn Smythe Trophy, 1977 Hart Trophy, the puck for his first goal, and four of his five Stanley Cup rings. The items&#x27; selling prices totalled approximately US$400,000, with Lafleur donating $20,000 to $25,000 to the Montreal Canadiens Foundation.

Besides the honours received during his playing career, in 1980 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 2005, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

In 1979, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

The Guy Lafleur Award of Excellence was introduced in 1985.

In 1998, he was ranked number 11 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players by the NHL as part of its centennial celebration.

The QMJHL retired Lafleur&#x27;s number 4 league-wide at the start of the 2021–22 season.

Lafleur was named to the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2022. Quebec Autoroute 50, which passes through his hometown of Thurso, was renamed in his honor on May 4, 2023.

<text>The Network is an American six-piece new wave band. A secret side project of rock band Green Day, they released their debut album &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; on Adeline Records on September 30, 2003. After a 15-year hiatus, the band became active again in 2020, releasing a follow-up album titled &quot;Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!&quot; in December 2020.

==History==
Formed in the summer of 2003, the band consisted of lead vocalist Fink, bassist Van Gough, and drummer Snoo, as well as additional members Captain Underpants and Z on keyboards and rhythm guitarist Balducci. They claimed they were &quot;brought together by an ancient prophecy&quot;.

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; was released in September 2003 on Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s record label Adeline Records. The Network concealed their identities by using accents and wearing masks. They frequently released press statements denouncing Green Day.

There is also an unsubstantiated rumor that members of the band Devo were involved, but their alleged participation has not been acknowledged by anyone in either band.

Shortly before the release of the debut album, Green Day&#x27;s then in the works album &quot;Cigarettes and Valentines&quot; was reportedly stolen. Due to the timeframe of the theft and the release of this album, many people speculated that they were related, however, Billie Joe Armstrong has denied connections between the two projects in various interviews, and in fact, that album was recovered and Armstrong and Mike Dirnt stated they had plans for it.

&quot;Money Money 2020&quot; was remastered and rereleased by Reprise Records on November 9, 2004, with two additional tracks, &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot; and a cover of The Misfits &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot;, which can also be heard on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; while &quot;Roshambo&quot; is on the &quot;NHL 2005&quot; soundtrack. The original &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; release came with a companion DVD with music videos directed and produced by Roy Miles of AntiDivision.

In October 2005, the group opened for Green Day for several shows. After this, they became inactive.

In October 2020, after 15 years of inactivity, the band released a teaser trailer entitled &quot;The Prophecy&quot;. In the video&#x27;s description, the band announced the release of their forthcoming album &quot;Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!&quot;. On November 2, 2020, the band released a song entitled &quot;Ivankkka Is A Nazi&quot; to their YouTube page with an accompanying music video. On November 20, 2020, the band released an EP entitled &quot;Trans Am&quot; to promote their upcoming album, which is when they revealed the full title of their new album. Following music videos for the songs &quot;Flat Earth&quot; and &quot;Fentanyl,&quot; the band released one-minute teaser videos for each group of songs (based upon the vinyl tracklisting) every day of the week of the album&#x27;s release. On December 4, 2020, &quot;Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!&quot; was released on streaming worldwide. On February 26, 2021, the band performed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

===Identities===

At the time, Armstrong denied the involvement of any Green Day members in The Network, saying &quot;All I gotta say is fuck The Network. These guys are totally spreading rumors.&quot; 

However, the three members of Green Day are cited as songwriters for &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; by the group&#x27;s publisher. Several journalists also noted that many songs from the band contained vocals that were unmistakably that of Armstrong. Additionally, it was shown that Armstrong owns a guitar amplifier with the logo of The Network featured on it.

In a 2013 interview, bassist Mike Dirnt finally revealed that the group was in fact Green Day, mentioning that &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; was worked upon alongside other Green Day projects in the mid-&#x27;00s.

URNs cannot be used to directly locate an item and need not be resolvable, as they are simply templates that another parser may use to find an item.

==URIs, URNs, and URLs==
URNs were originally conceived to be part of a three-part information architecture for the Internet, along with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs), a metadata framework. As described in , and later in , URNs were distinguished from URLs, which identify resources by specifying their locations in the context of a particular access protocol, such as HTTP or FTP. In contrast, URNs were conceived as persistent, location-independent identifiers assigned within defined namespaces, typically by an authority responsible for the namespace, so that they are globally unique and persistent over long periods of time, even after the resource which they identify ceases to exist or becomes unavailable. 

URCs never progressed past the conceptual stage, and other technologies such as the Resource Description Framework later took their place. Since in 2005, use of the terms &quot;Uniform Resource Name&quot; and &quot;Uniform Resource Locator&quot; has been deprecated in technical standards in favor of the term Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which encompasses both, a view proposed in 2001 by a joint working group between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

A URI is a string of characters used to identify or name a resource on the internet. URIs are used in many Internet protocols to refer to and access information resources. URI schemes include the codice_1 and codice_2 protocols, as well as hundreds of others.

In the &quot;contemporary view&quot;, as it is called, all URIs identify or name resources, perhaps uniquely and persistently, with some of them also being &quot;locators&quot; which are resolvable in conjunction with a specified protocol to a representation of the resources.

Other URIs are not locators and are not necessarily resolvable within the bounds of the systems where they are found. These URIs may serve as names or identifiers of resources. Since resources can move, opaque identifiers which &quot;are not&quot; locators and are not bound to particular locations are arguably more likely than identifiers which &quot;are&quot; locators to remain unique and persistent over time. But whether a URI is resolvable depends on many operational and practical details, irrespective of whether it is called a &quot;name&quot; or a &quot;locator&quot;. In the contemporary view, there is no bright line between &quot;names&quot; and &quot;locators&quot;.

In accord with this way of thinking, the distinction between Uniform Resource &quot;Names&quot; and Uniform Resource &quot;Locators&quot; is now no longer used in formal Internet Engineering Task Force technical standards, though the latter term, URL, is still in wide informal use.

The term &quot;URN&quot; continues now as one of more than a hundred URI &quot;schemes&quot;, codice_3, paralleling codice_4, codice_5, and so forth. URIs of the codice_3 scheme are not locators, are not required to be associated with a particular protocol or access method, and need not be resolvable. They should be assigned by a procedure which provides some assurance that they will remain unique and identify the same resource persistently over a prolonged period. Some namespaces under the codice_3 scheme, such as codice_8 assign identifiers in a manner which does not require a registration authority, but most of them do. A typical URN namespace is codice_9, for International Standard Book Numbers. This view is continued in (2017).

There are other URI schemes, such as codice_10, codice_11 (now largely deprecated), and codice_12 which are similar to the codice_3 scheme in not being locators and not being associated with particular resolution or access protocols.

==Syntax==
The syntax of a codice_3 scheme URI is represented in the augmented Backus–Naur form as:
namestring = assigned-name
 [ rq-components ]
 [ &quot;#&quot; f-component ]
assigned-name = &quot;urn&quot; &quot;:&quot; NID &quot;:&quot; NSS
NID = (alphanum) 0*30(ldh) (alphanum)
ldh = alphanum / &quot;-&quot;
NSS = pchar *(pchar / &quot;/&quot;)
rq-components = [ &quot;?+&quot; r-component ]
 [ &quot;?=&quot; q-component ]
r-component = pchar *( pchar / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;?&quot; )
q-component = pchar *( pchar / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;?&quot; )
f-component = fragment

; general URI syntax rules (RFC3986)
fragment = *( pchar / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;?&quot; )
pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / &quot;:&quot; / &quot;@&quot;
pct-encoded = &quot;%&quot; HEXDIG HEXDIG
unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot; / &quot;.&quot; / &quot;_&quot; / &quot;~&quot;
sub-delims = &quot;!&quot; / &quot;$&quot; / &quot;&amp;&quot; / &quot;&#x27;&quot; / &quot;(&quot; / &quot;)&quot; / &quot;*&quot; / &quot;+&quot; / &quot;,&quot; / &quot;;&quot; / &quot;=&quot;

alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT ; obsolete, usage is deprecated
or, in the form of a syntax diagram, as:

* The leading scheme () is case-insensitive.
* is the namespace identifier, and may include letters, digits, and codice_15.
* The NID is followed by the namespace-specific string , the interpretation of which depends on the specified namespace. The NSS may contain ASCII letters and digits, and many punctuation and special characters. Disallowed ASCII and Unicode characters may be included if percent-encoded.

In 2017, the syntax for URNs was updated:

* The slash character (codice_16) is now allowed in the NSS to represent names containing slashes from non-URN identifier systems.
* The q-component was added to enable passing of parameters to named resources.
* The r-component was added to enable passing of parameters to resolvers. However, the updated specification notes that it should not be used until its semantics are defined via further standardization.

==Namespaces==
In order to ensure the global uniqueness of URN namespaces, their identifiers (NIDs) are required to be registered with the IANA. Registered namespaces may be &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;informal&quot;. An exception to the registration requirement was formerly made for &quot;experimental namespaces&quot;, since rescinded by RFC 8141.

===Formal===
Approximately sixty formal URN namespace identifiers have been registered. These are namespaces where Internet users are expected to benefit from their publication, and are subject to several restrictions. They must:

* Not be an already-registered NID
* Not start with 
* Be more than two letters long
* Not start with , where XY is any combination of two ASCII letters
* Not start with (see &quot;Experimental namespaces&quot;, below)

===Informal===
Informal namespaces are registered with IANA and assigned a number sequence (chosen by IANA on a first-come-first-served basis) as an identifier, in the format
:codice_17

Informal namespaces are fully fledged URN namespaces and can be registered in global registration services.

===Experimental===
An exception to the registration requirement was formerly made for &quot;experimental namespaces&quot;. However, following the deprecation of the &quot;X-&quot; notation for new identifier names, did away with experimental URN namespaces, indicating a preference for use of the codice_18 namespace where appropriate.

<text>North Greenwich is a London Underground station at the northernmost tip of the Royal Borough of Greenwich.


The tube station opened on 14 May 1999. It is adjacent to The O2 (originally the Millennium Dome) at the northern end of the Greenwich Peninsula, on the south bank of the Thames, and is the easternmost below-ground station on the line.

It is served by the Jubilee line between and stations, in Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

==History==
An Underground station was first proposed for the Greenwich Peninsula in a government report on the redevelopment of London&#x27;s Docklands published in 1973. The proposal, part of the then unbuilt Fleet line, proposed a line running from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Beckton, with stations on each side at Millwall and Custom House. The proposal was developed during the 1970s as the Fleet line developed into the Jubilee line. The route was approved in 1980, but financial constraints meant that the route was not proceeded with. 

In the early 1990s, the Jubilee Line Extension was proposed to serve the growing Docklands developments. A station was originally planned at Blackwall north of the river, but the line was diverted between Canary Wharf and Stratford underneath the Thames to serve the Greenwich peninsula. The line would therefore serve Port Greenwich, a planned housing development on the site of disused gasworks. It was initially unclear whether or not a station would be built on the site, with British Gas plc contributed £25 million towards the opening of the station. 

Architects Alsop, Lyall and Störmer were chosen by Roland Paoletti to design the station, with initial proposals of the station box open to the air as a sunken garden, with ticket hall suspended above the tracks. To allow for future development above the station, a decision was made to put a roof on the station instead.

Construction began in 1993, with the site on the Greenwich peninsula used for tunnelling under the River Thames. In 1996, Greenwich was chosen as the site for the Millennium Experience, with the under construction station considered to be a key part of the transport infrastructure. The station was opened on 14 May 1999, by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. During 2000, thousands of visitors used the station to visit the Millennium Experience at the Millennium Dome. In May 2001, the station car park was opened. Originally with 800 spaces, it now has 509 parking spaces for use by Underground customers.

On 20 October 2016, the military conducted a controlled explosion on an improvised explosive device at North Greenwich after a passenger spotted an unattended bag filled with &quot;wires and an alarm clock&quot; aboard a Jubilee line train. No injuries were reported, and a suspect was later detained. The man, Damon Smith, was convicted of possession of an explosive substance with intent and was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Station design==
North Greenwich is one of the largest stations on the Jubilee line, capable of handling around 20,000 passengers an hour, having been designed to cope with the large number of visitors expected at the Millennium Dome (now The O2 Arena).

The striking blue-tiled and glazed interior, with raking concrete columns rearing up inside the huge underground space, was designed by the architects practice Alsop, Lyall and Störmer. The blue tiles on walls were inspired by the design of MTR stations in Hong Kong, where every station adopts a livery in order to help passengers to recognise their alighting stop. As with other stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, all platforms are equipped with platform screen doors.

The track layout allows trains from both Stanmore and Stratford to terminate at North Greenwich. A number of trains from Stanmore terminate here during peak and off-peak times, and enter platform 2 instead of the usual platform 3. Trains head back towards central London from platform 2. During times of disruption and engineering work, trains from and back to Stratford can be routed into and out of platform 2.

The track layout at North Greenwich was designed to allow a branch off the line from this station. A branch towards Thamesmead was planned; however this has not been developed beyond the initial proposal, and is not currently in Transport for London&#x27;s investment programme.

==Connections==
The bus station is interconnected and above the tube station on the surface for direct transfer with London Buses routes 108, 129, 132, 161, 180, 188, 335, 422, 472 and 486 serving the station. Additionally, routes 108, 188, 472 and 486 provide a 24-hour service.

The IFS Cloud Cable Car opened nearby on 28 June 2012, providing a link between the Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Victoria Dock and ExCeL London.

<doc id="333703" wikidata="Q176288" url="?curid=333703" title="Angelo Dundee">
<text>Angelo Dundee (born Angelo Mirena; August 30, 1921February 1, 2012) was an American boxing trainer and cornerman. Internationally known for his work with Muhammad Ali (1960–1981), he also worked with 15 other world boxing champions, including Sugar Ray Leonard, Sean Mannion, José Nápoles, George Foreman, George Scott, Jimmy Ellis, Carmen Basilio, Luis Manuel Rodríguez, and Willie Pastrano.

==Early life==
Dundee was born Angelo Mirena on 30 August 1921 in Philadelphia, to Italian recent immigrant parents Filomena Cianelli, mother of seven children, and Angelo Merenda, a railway construction worker, an Italian native from Roggiano Gravina. (The name of the father was erroneously transcribed as Mirena at the time of immigration.) In the early 1940s he changed his surname to &#x27;Dundee&#x27;, after the United States champion boxer Johnny Dundee. During World War II he served as an aircraft mechanic in the United States Air Force, including an active service deployment to England in 1944–45. His first experience of cornerman work was in U.S.A.F. boxing tournaments, and after leaving the Air Force in late 1945 at the war&#x27;s end he headed to New York City where he was employed as a bucket-guy at Stillman&#x27;s Gym as an apprenticeship as a boxing trainer.

==Boxing trainer career==
After completing his apprenticeship in New York City, Dundee relocated to Miami Beach, Florida, where he worked with his brother Chris Dundee, founder and owner of the Fifth Street Gym. Carmen Basilio was the first World Champion for whom Dundee acted as a cornerman, when Basilio defeated Tony DeMarco for the world welterweight crown in 1955, and Sugar Ray Robinson for the World Middleweight Crown in 1957.

===Career with Muhammad Ali===

Dundee traveled around the world with Ali, and he was the cornerman in all but two of Ali&#x27;s fights (Tunney Hunsaker in 1960 and Jimmy Ellis in 1971). Dundee trained the young Cassius Clay, as Ali was then known, in most of his early bouts, including those with Archie Moore (who had trained Clay before his partnering with Dundee) and Sonny Liston, where Clay won the heavyweight title. Dundee continued to train Ali in all of his fights until Ali&#x27;s exile from boxing, and upon Ali&#x27;s return to the sport Dundee trained him in almost all of his fights, including Ali&#x27;s famed bouts with fighters such as Jerry Quarry, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Frazier, Floyd Patterson, George Foreman, Ken Norton and, later, Leon Spinks. One exception was in Ali&#x27;s 1971 fight with Jimmy Ellis, where Dundee was in Ellis&#x27;s corner. Ali knocked Ellis out in the 12th round. Dundee was accused by Foreman of loosening the ring ropes before his 1974 &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight with Ali to help Ali win the fight by using the rope-a-dope technique. Dundee consistently denied tampering with the ropes.

In 1998, after decades, Dundee reunited with Muhammad Ali and appeared alongside him in a sentimental Super Bowl commercial. The two men were friends until Dundee&#x27;s death and the veteran trainer would always refer to Ali as &quot;my kid&quot;.

===Other work===
Dundee saw a future emerging star in Sugar Ray Leonard, whom he called &quot;a smaller version of Ali&quot;. Dundee acted as cornerman for Leonard in many of his biggest fights, including those with Wilfred Benítez, Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler. In Leonard&#x27;s first bout with Hearns, Dundee, thinking that his protégé was behind on the scorecards, quipped the now famous words, &quot;You&#x27;re blowing it, son! You&#x27;re blowing it!&quot; before the start of round 13. Leonard went on to score a fourteenth round win when the referee stopped the fight.

Dundee frequently went to other matches during his career to scout other boxers. During the first Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman bout in Kingston, Jamaica, on January 22, 1973, he sat near Howard Cosell, who was recording a call for ABC for a tape delay re-broadcast. He was overheard on the call noting that Frazier had been hurt before he was knocked down by Foreman the first time in the first round; Cosell mentioned it immediately before his famous &quot;Down goes Frazier!&quot; call. Later in the bout, Dundee was overheard pleading for the fight to be stopped as Frazier was repeatedly knocked down. The fight was finally stopped after Frazier was knocked down for the sixth time, with Foreman winning the bout—and the lineal World Heavyweight Championship—by technical knockout.

He later teamed up with George Foreman, including his 1991 Heavyweight title fight against Evander Holyfield and his 1994 Heavyweight title win against then-undefeated Michael Moorer.

In addition, Dundee also trained world champions Luis Rodriguez, Willie Pastrano, Ralph Dupas, José Nápoles, Pinklon Thomas, Trevor Berbick, Jimmy Ellis, Wilfredo Gómez, Michael Nunn and Sugar Ramos, as well as other boxers including Bill Bossio, David Estrada, Douglas Vaillant, Jimmy Lange, Tom Zbikowski, Troy Darrell, Adilson Rodrigues, James Tillis,Pat O&#x27;Connor and Sean Mannion.

===Reputation===
Throughout his career, Dundee was widely respected as a decent, honorable man in an often corrupt sport. Perhaps the greatest tribute to Dundee was paid by Howard Cosell who said &quot;If I had a son who wanted to be a fighter and I couldn&#x27;t talk him out of it, the only man I would let train him is Angelo Dundee&quot;.

==Retirement==

In 2005, Dundee was hired to train Russell Crowe for Crowe&#x27;s characterization of James J. Braddock in &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;. To that end, Dundee traveled to Australia to work with the Oscar-winning actor and appeared in the film as &quot;Angelo&quot; the corner man. In November 2008, he was hired as a special consultant for Oscar De La Hoya&#x27;s fight with Manny Pacquiao.

==Death==
Dundee died peacefully in his sleep at his senior resident apartment at the age of 90 on February 1, 2012, in Tampa, Florida. A funeral was held on 10 February 2012 at the Countryside Christian Center in Clearwater, Florida, attended by a crowd of several hundred mourners, among them Muhammad Ali. Dundee&#x27;s body was buried in Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park cemetery in Clearwater, Florida.

==Honors==
Dundee was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.

The eventual outcome was the accession of the Angevins in the person of Henry II.
# First Barons&#x27; War (1215–1217) – a civil war in the Kingdom of England in which a group of rebellious barons, led by Robert Fitzwalter and supported by a French army under the future Louis VIII of France, made war on King John of England.

William the Conqueror paid Sweyn and his Danish fleet to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires using scorched earth tactics.

<text>Maze Hill railway station is in Greenwich, London, and is situated on the Greenwich Line connecting suburbs (e.g.: Deptford, Greenwich, Charlton, Woolwich, to Dartford, Kent) along the south side of the River Thames with central London stations (London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross). The station is in the Maze Hill area of Greenwich, and is the closest station to Greenwich Park, being about 150m east of the north-east corner of the park. It is down the line from London Bridge.

==History==
Maze Hill station opened in 1873 by the South Eastern Railway (SER) and for five years functioned as a terminus on a line linked to the North Kent Line just west of Charlton. On 1 February 1878 a cut-and-cover tunnel link between Greenwich and Maze Hill was opened, completing a through line from the original London &amp; Greenwich Railway to the North Kent Line.

In 1899 the SER handed over its operations to a new organisation co-owned with the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway (LCDR), which traded as the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway (SECR); the line and station continued to be owned and maintained by the SER.

In the 1923 Grouping, the SER and LCDR amalgamated with other railways to form the Southern Railway (SR). Three years later in 1926 the line through Maze Hill was electrified using the 750 V DC third rail system. A limited electric service started on 10 May with a full electric service being operated from 19 July.

In 1948 following nationalisation the station became part of the Southern Region of British Railways.

On 4 July 1958 there was a collision between two trains at Maze Hill. The 09.41 electric passenger train from Gravesend Central to Charing Cross ran past the Up Home signal at danger and collided head-on with a nine-coach empty steam passenger stock train which was being shunted slowly from the Up Sidings across the Up line towards the Down line. The accident occurred as the empty train was entering the crossover leading from the Up to the Down line. The passenger train was approaching the station at about 40 mph when the motorman (driver), who had failed to observe the home signal, saw the obstruction ahead and applied the brakes. His action was too late to be effective and the collision occurred at a speed of about 25 mph. Forty-three people were injured although none seriously.

Following a fire, the station was rebuilt with a glass-walled booking hall as a prototype for the rebuilding of similar Southern suburban stations. The new building was opened by the Mayor of Greenwich on 14 July 1972.

In 1982 following the establishment of three passenger business sectors, Maze Hill was part of the London &amp; South Eastern business sector which became Network SouthEast in 1986. Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1994 operation of the infrastructure became the responsibility of Railtrack, whilst passenger services were operated by Connex South Eastern. In 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority terminated the Connex franchise and for the next three years the train service was run by a state owned company South Eastern Trains. Operation then transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006. Following financial problems Network Rail took over operation of the infrastructure in 2002.

In April 2002 the station was the scene of a fight between Charlton Athletic and Southampton football hooligans that became known as The Battle of Maze Hill.

== Location ==
The station lies at the eastern end of a tunnel underneath the grounds of the National Maritime Museum – itself only a 5- to 10-minute walk away through the park.

The station allows passengers to board west-bound trains to Greenwich and Deptford and then on to central London, and east-bound trains towards Dartford and north Kent.

==Services==
Services at Maze Hill are operated by Southeastern and Thameslink using , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to London Cannon Street
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to , returning to London Cannon Street via and 
* 2 tph to via 

Additional services, including trains to and from London Cannon Street via call at the station during the peak hours.


== Connections ==
London Buses routes 129, 177, 188, 286, 386 and night route N1 serve the station, running along Trafalgar Road, approximately 100m north of the station.

Born in Kingstree, South Carolina, Mouzon moved as a child to Philadelphia, long considered one of the best &quot;boxing school&quot; cities in the United States. In Philadelphia, he learned how to box.

Mouzon is better known in the boxing world for his results against two former world champions: Ike Williams and Bob Montgomery. He drew with Williams, and beat Montgomery by knockout. His career had a sudden finish, however, when rematched with Montgomery: He lost by knockout in their second bout, and suffered a detached retina. At the time, detached retinas meant automatic retirement for fighters, and Mouzon had to retire at the young age of 19. He had a record of 23 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw, with 9 wins by knockout.

Mouzon went on to train some recognizable boxing figures, such as the former two time world champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi (whom he also managed), Roy Jones Jr. title challenger Tony Thornton and Vinnie Burgese, the latter of whom called Mouzon the best trainer he had.

On July 1, 2003, he died from kidney cancer.

<text>Westcombe Park station is in Greenwich, London, and is situated on the Greenwich Line connecting suburbs (e.g.: Deptford, Greenwich, Charlton, Woolwich, to Dartford, Kent) along the south side of the River Thames with central London stations (London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross).

It is down the line from .

== History ==

The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1879, the year after the through line from Greenwich to Maze Hill was finally completed. This connected the original London and Greenwich Railway to the North Kent Line just west of Charlton. The section between Charlton and Maze Hill had opened in 1873, with Maze Hill functioning as a terminus until 1878.

== Location ==
The station lies at the northern end of a conservation area (Westcombe Park), 5–10 minutes walk down Westcombe Hill from the Blackheath Standard area of Blackheath. It is the closest station to Woodlands House (once the home of John Julius Angerstein and later an art gallery and history archives centre), and is also close to the southern approach to the Blackwall Tunnel, a notorious traffic bottleneck.

== Services ==
Services at Westcombe Park are operated by Southeastern and Thameslink using , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to London Cannon Street
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to , returning to London Cannon Street via and 
* 2 tph to via 

Additional services, including trains to and from London Cannon Street via call at the station during the peak hours.


==Connections==

<doc id="333719" wikidata="Q2750075" url="?curid=333719" title="Northern Football League">
<text>The Northern League is a British men&#x27;s football league in north east England. Having been founded in 1889, it is the second-oldest football league in the world still in existence after the English Football League.

It contains two divisions; Division One and Division Two. Division One sits on the ninth tier of the English football league system, five divisions below the Football League. These leagues cover the historic counties of Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire&#x27;s North Riding. The champion club of Division One is promoted to the lower division of the Northern Premier League.

==History==
The Northern league was one of many leagues formed the year after the Football League. In its first season, it consisted of ten clubs that were a mixture of professional and amateur organisations. During its early years, the competition included clubs such as Newcastle United, Middlesbrough and Darlington that would go on to play in the Football League. In 1905, the league split into two divisions, one professional and one amateur. The next year, however, the Northern League made the decision to abolish the professional division and restrict itself to amateur clubs, or at least clubs that claimed to be amateur.

Between the World Wars and in the early years following World War II, the Northern League&#x27;s amateur status meant that they and their equivalent in the London area, the Isthmian League, dominated the old FA Amateur Cup. The two Leagues continued to be separate from the professional game which was dominated by the Football League, Southern League and, from 1968, the Northern Premier League.

The Northern League and Isthmian League (with its feeder leagues) continued to claim amateur status right up until, following pressure, amateur status was abandoned by the Football Association in 1974. This left amateur leagues like the Northern to find a place in the overall structure of non-League football. Unlike its southern equivalent, the Isthmian League, who became a feeder to the Alliance Premier League in 1982, the Northern League rejected repeated invitations. Ultimately, the Northern League remained out of the football pyramid until 1991. The league declined throughout the 1980s as its leading clubs defected to other leagues within the football pyramid, such as the Northern Counties East Football League. When the Northern League finally joined the pyramid, it was as a feeder league to the lower division of the Northern Premier League (Level 9).

Since 1995, Northern League clubs have competed for the FA Vase, with some success, having won 11 finals, losing 4 finals. There were two all Northern League finals in 2012 (Dunston UTS beat West Auckland Town) and 2020 (Hebburn Town beat Consett).

The League had an unusual sponsorship deal put in place by Brooks Mileson, owner of the Albany Group, who were its sponsors in 2003. In that year, Mileson announced that he had created a trust which would continue to sponsor the league throughout his lifetime and that of his sons. In 2008, however, the league announced that this sponsorship had come to an end, and it held a raffle to determine its next sponsor. Interested parties were invited to buy a stake in the raffle for £250. The winning stake was held by a local training company and the league was known as the skilltrainingltd Northern League from the 2008–09 season until the 2011–12 season. The league is currently sponsored by dehumidifier manufacturer Ebac.

Level 11 clubs from the North Riding Football League, Northern Football Alliance and Wearside Football League may apply for promotion into the Northern League&#x27;s Second Division (level 10).

<doc id="333720" wikidata="Q880946" url="?curid=333720" title="Blackwall Tunnel">
<text>The Blackwall Tunnel is a pair of road tunnels underneath the River Thames in east London, England, linking the London Borough of Tower Hamlets with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and part of the A102 road. The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall; the southern entrances are just south of The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula. The road is managed by Transport for London (TfL).

The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the Prince of Wales as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London&#x27;s East End. It carried a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate. A second bore opened in 1967 to relieve congestion, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound traffic.

The northern approach takes traffic from the A12 and the southern approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. 

It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until their controversial removal in 2007. Given the very high traffic volumes at the crossing (and the height restrictions of the Victorian bore) the crossing is being supplemented by the Silvertown Tunnel, nearing completion. When the Silvertown Tunnel opens on 7 April 2025, both it and the Blackwall Tunnels will be tolled.

The tunnels are no longer open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic, and the northbound tunnel has a height limit. The London Buses route 108 between Lewisham and Stratford runs through the tunnels.

==History==

===Old tunnel===

A tunnel in the Blackwall area was originally proposed in the 1880s. A bridge was not feasible due to shipping in the River Thames in East London. According to Robert Webster, then MP for St Pancras East, a tunnel would &quot;be very useful to the East End of London, a district representing in trade and commerce a population greater than the combined populations of Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham.&quot; By this time, all road bridges in London east of the ferry at Chiswick were toll-free, but these were of little use to the two fifths of London&#x27;s population that lived to the east of London Bridge. 
The (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. clxxii) was enacted in August 1887. It provided the legal framework necessary to construct the tunnel. The initial proposal, made by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, called for three parallel tunnels, two for vehicular traffic and one for foot, with an expected completion date of works within seven years. It was originally commissioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works but, just before the contract was due to start, responsibility passed to the London County Council (LCC) when the former body was abolished in 1889 and Bazalgette&#x27;s work on the tunnel ended.
The original tunnel as built was designed by Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson &amp; Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It has an external diameter of 27 feet | 8.23 metres and was constructed using a Greathead tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The workforce was largely drawn from outside London; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.

The tunnel was formally opened by the Prince of Wales on 22 May 1897. The total cost of the tunnel was £1.4 million, and 800 men were employed in its construction, during which seven deaths were recorded.

The southern entrance gateway to the tunnel, also known as Southern Tunnel House, was designed by LCC architect Thomas Blashill and was built just before the tunnel was completed. It comprises two floors with an attic.

Today the western bore is only used for northbound traffic and is not accessible to vehicles taller than . The tunnel has several sharp bends, in order that the tunnel could align with Northumberland Wharf to the north and Ordnance Wharf to the south, and avoid a sewer underneath Bedford Street. Some sources, such as PJ Thomas (circa 1899), state that an additional purpose was to prevent horses from bolting once they saw daylight. The tunnel carries two lanes of traffic, though higher vehicles need to keep to the left-hand lane so that they do not hit the tunnel&#x27;s inner lining.

===New tunnel===

Due to the increase in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act in 1938, the London County Council (Tunnel and Improvements) Act 1938 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 6. c. lxxxi), allowing them to construct a new tunnel, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with preliminary work on the northern approach road. By this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.

The new eastern tunnel, in diameter, was accepted into the roads programme in March 1959, and construction started in March 1960. It was opened on 2 August 1967 by Desmond Plummer, Leader of the Greater London Council (GLC). It is wider than the western tunnel, carries two lanes of traffic and is usable by vehicles up to in height. During construction, transport minister Ernest Marples clarified that unlike the Dartford Tunnel, also then under construction, tolls would not be imposed as the tunnel was already an established route. 

At the time of opening, the strip lighting in the tunnel was commended as &quot;a big improvement&quot; on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends, and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re-opened on 4 April 1969 with a new overheight vehicle detection system.

In the late 1960s, proposals were made to connect the tunnel with a free-flow, grade-separated motorway system as part of the London Ringways project. The only parts of this project completed were the A102(M) Blackwall Tunnel approach roads in 1973.

The entrance gateway to the northbound tunnel was Grade II listed in 1973, while the ventilation towers were listed in 2000. In April 1986, the tunnel became part of the UK trunk road network. It was detrunked and control handed to TfL in September 1999.

===Provisional IRA bombing===
On 18 January 1979, an anonymous caller to the Press Association informed them that the Provisional IRA had planted a bomb in the tunnel that was scheduled to detonate at midnight. While the Metropolitan Police were searching the tunnel, the bomb detonated at 12:40 a.m., causing an explosion in a gas holder near the southern exit. This resulted in a fire on another gas holder approximately an hour later. No injuries were reported. Speaking in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Merlyn Rees hoped &quot;the House will join me in condemning these attacks and will support the Government in their determination not to be swayed by such methods&quot;. A Belfast man was jailed in May 1983 for his role in the bombing, and was eventually released at the end of his sentence some 17½ years later, still professing pride in his IRA participation.

==Nearest alternative crossings==
TfL states that one of the major issues with the Blackwall Tunnels is the lack of resilience in the event of an incident—as the nearest alternative road crossings are the Rotherhithe Tunnel to the west, Tower Bridge to the west, and the Dartford Crossing to the east. The Woolwich Free Ferry is to the east, but is closed overnight, often reduced to one boat in operation, or completely closed at weekends. Variable message signs (VMS) near the tunnel inform drivers if the ferry is available. When open, queuing for the ferry causes significant congestion around Woolwich town centre.

Underground railway links include the Jubilee line from North Greenwich (TfL) to Canning Town on the east and Canary Wharf on the west. The Docklands Light Railway also passes under the Thames between Island Gardens at the southern end of the Isle of Dogs and Cutty Sark in the centre of Greenwich.

Horse-drawn traffic was partially banned from the tunnel during peak hours in July 1939 and completely banned in August 1947. Pedestrians have been banned from using the Blackwall Tunnels since May 1969.

The London Buses route 108 (Stratford–Lewisham) runs through the tunnels and there are bus priority gates at both entrances to allow buses to avoid traffic congestion. On occasion in the past, buses have been escorted through the tunnel when it has been closed to other traffic.

==Traffic management==
The northbound Blackwall Tunnel is a traffic bottleneck with tailbacks. A TfL study in 2009 revealed that the approach to the northbound tunnel took around 19 minutes in rush hour traffic, or a delay of approximately 11 minutes per kilometre. To relieve the congestion, a tidal flow system was introduced in 1978, allowing northbound traffic to use the western lane of the eastern tunnel. The congestion is not limited to weekday rush hours. There is often congestion with tailbacks at the weekends, especially on Sunday evenings.
Due to its sharp turns with restricted headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane of the western tunnel, so it was not possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. In April 2007, the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.

In November 2007, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone responded to complaints from Greenwich Council about congestion in the area, with the possibility of setting up a small congestion charging zone. He clarified that this would not extend to the Blackwall Tunnel, stating &quot;I have given that commitment right the way through my period as Mayor, and there cannot be anything that impacts on the A2 because the impact then on Lewisham is unacceptable.&quot; In 2012, TfL announced their intention to toll the tunnels to pay for the Silvertown Link crossing, suggesting it was the &quot;most appropriate way&quot;. Responding to this, Paul Watters from the AA said &quot;We’ve already seen the Western extension of the congestion charge dropped because it was hugely unpopular and I think tolling on the Blackwall Tunnel will be as controversial as that.&quot;

In June 2013, TfL announced they would send registration details of any broken-down or over-height commercial vehicle in the tunnel to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA), and set up a new automatic recognition system to detect unsuitable heavy goods vehicles heading towards it. TfL commissioner Sir Peter Hendy said that &quot;this partnership working will help improve traffic flow on one of the busiest routes in the capital.&quot;

==Maintenance and closures==

The Blackwall Tunnel has attracted criticism in the past for its perceived lack of safety. In 2002, a survey by major motoring organisations rated the tunnel&#x27;s safety record as &quot;very poor&quot;, and concluded it was one of the least safe tunnels in Europe. In 2010, the northbound tunnel was refurbished in order to meet current safety standards. Fire detection systems have been installed in response to new European regulations in the light of recent tunnel fires.

In 2010, the southbound tunnel was affected by planned closures for maintenance from 10 pm to 5 am, Thursday to Sunday inclusive, and over a number of whole weekends. The tunnel was only closed six full weekends instead of the planned ten.

The tunnel also suffers regular problems with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles running out of fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to the north end of the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; magazine reported it shut 1,448 times in 2010. To try to prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.

During the 2010s the tunnel has been closed to motor traffic to provide cyclists access to the RideLondon event, although this arrangement is no longer in place.

==Future==

The Blackwall Tunnel is the only major road crossing of the Thames in East London, and consequently has very high traffic volumes. Furthermore, the limitations of the western bore of the tunnel (not accessible to vehicles taller than ), mean that larger HGV and double decker buses cannot pass through the tunnel in both directions. Given this, an expansion of the crossing has been proposed for many years—such as a third bore of the tunnel, proposed in 1989—however none of these proposals have come to fruition. 

Following the cancellation of the Thames Gateway Bridge in 2008, a new crossing from the Greenwich Peninsula to Silvertown—the Silvertown Tunnel—was proposed by TfL. Following a public inquiry, the government approved the proposal in May 2018, and the contract to build the tunnel was awarded in November 2019. Construction began in March 2021. 

===Charges=== 
Charging for the Blackwall Tunnel will begin when the Silvertown Tunnel opens on 7 April 2025. Charges for the Blackwall tunnel will be same as for the Silvertown tunnel, and will apply between 06:00 and 22:00. Use of the tunnel will be free overnight. Peak times are Monday to Friday, 06:00 to 10:00 northbound and 16:00 to 19:00 southbound. Users must use TfL&#x27;s Auto Pay system to benefit from off-peak tolls.

* Cars and small vans: £4 peak, £1.50 off-peak
* Motorcycles: £2.50 peak, £1.50 off-peak
* Large vans: £6.50 peak, £2.50 off-peak
* Heavy goods vehicles: £10.00 peak, £5.00 off-peak
Taxis, blue badge holders, wheelchair-accessible and &#x27;zero-emission capable&#x27; private hire vehicles licensed by TfL will be exempt. Discounts are available to low income drivers in 12 boroughs, and for small businesses in Tower Hamlets, Newham and Greenwich.

<doc id="333723" wikidata="Q1450285" url="?curid=333723" title="Rotherhithe Tunnel">
<text>The Rotherhithe Tunnel, designated the A101, is a road tunnel under the River Thames in East London, connecting Limehouse in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets north of the river to Rotherhithe in the London Borough of Southwark south of the river. It was formally opened in 1908 by George, Prince of Wales (later King George V), and Richard Robinson, Chairman of the London County Council. It is a rare example of a road tunnel where road traffic, pedestrians and cyclists all share the same tunnel bore. Transport for London took over ownership and maintenance of the tunnel in 2001.

It should not be confused with the nearby earlier Thames Tunnel, designed and built under the supervision of Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel, used by London Overground for the East London Line.

==Construction==

Following the success of the Blackwall Tunnel, opened in 1897, the London County Council (LCC) decided to construct another toll-free road crossing of the River Thames located in the heart of the then flourishing London Docks, midway between Tower Bridge and the Blackwall Tunnel. When originally opened the route served the Surrey Commercial Docks on the south side and Limehouse and West India Docks on the north side. The tunnel was authorised by the &quot;Thames Tunnel (Rotherhithe and Ratcliff) Act 1900&quot;. Designed by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, the engineer for LCC, it copied closely the Blackwall Tunnel; however it is of larger diameter. At the time of its construction, the tunnel was said to be &quot;the largest subaqueous tunnel in existence&quot;. The tunnel&#x27;s construction, especially the long approach ramps, displaced nearly 3,000 local residents and generated considerable local opposition. In 1903, the LCC built new tenement blocks in Swan Lane (now Swan Road), Clarence Street and Albion Street in Rotherhithe and Brightlingsea Buildings on Ropemaker&#x27;s Field in Limehouse. These blocks had more modern facilities but the rents charged were significantly higher and many soon moved out of the area.

The tunnel was constructed between 1904 and 1908 by resident engineer Edward H. Tabor and contractors Price and Reeves, at a cost of about £1 million (equivalent to around £ in ). It was excavated partly using a tunnelling shield and partly by cut-and-cover. Two tunnelling shields were employed. The first was used in the very challenging and difficult ground conditions encountered on the south side and under river sections, whilst a second lighter, shorter shield was employed on the north side where the ground conditions were better. The first shield was only able to be used in a straight line, whilst the second one could be steered through gentle curves. The tunnelling was constructed under compressed air and the river-bed lined with puddle clay. No construction workers were killed owing to the extensive safety precautions undertaken; a rarity at that time for a project of this size and complexity. The entrance arches have been formed from cutting edges from the second tunnelling shield, which measured in diameter, forming in effect a loading gauge for the tunnel.

==Physical characteristics==
The tunnel consists of a single bore, long, carrying a two-lane carriageway below the high-water level of the Thames, with a maximum depth of below the surface. Four shafts were sunk alongside the tunnel to aid construction, later ventilation and entrance shafts. The shafts are numbered 1 to 4, south to north.

Shaft 1 is located on the corner of Brunel Road and Canon Beck Road in Rotherhithe. It contains ventilation fans that supply fresh air to the tunnel. It is a single storey circular redbrick building, originally constructed without a roof. It now has a high roof containing three large vents. Also within the shaft is a floodgate dating from 1939 which protects the nearby London Overground.

Shaft 2 is located along the river front close to Rotherhithe Street Bascule Bridge on the south side of the river. Shaft 3 is the corresponding shaft on the north side located by the river in King Edward VII Memorial Park. They are both single storey circular redbrick buildings with ornate ironwork grilles in the large side openings and granite dressings. Each contain an iron spiral staircases that were originally pedestrian access points but were closed in the 1970s due to low usage and security concerns. The shaft buildings were originally capped with a dome glass roof (similar to that at Greenwich Foot Tunnel) however these were removed in the 1930s in a bid to improve ventilation within the tunnel. New roofs were added in 2007 to a different design. The staircases having been open to the elements for more than 70 years suffered extensive corrosion and were fully refurbished the same year. The shaft buildings and staircases for these two shafts were Grade II heritage listed in 1983. Both shafts contain ventilation fans which are primarily used to extract foul air from the tunnel however the low height of these shaft buildings prevents efficient dilution and dispersal of pollutants.

Shaft 4 is located on the corner of The Highway and Heckford Street. The original redbrick circular building was demolished in 1967 to allow widening of The Highway to four lanes which now extends over half the shaft. A plain surface building was constructed to house the fresh air supply fans.

Pedestrian access to the tunnel is now limited to the portals; however there are granite staircases topped with ornate lighting columns close to each portal as an alternative to the footpaths on the approach ramps.

The tunnel is entered via a sloping brick-lined cutting at each end leading to the entrance portal. Both portals are faced with pink granite and were given Grade II heritage listing in 1983. On the Rotherhithe side (south side) the approach road spans over the platforms of Rotherhithe London Overground station. It was originally planned the tunnel would commence before the railway was reached however during construction this was changed to be north of this instead thus shortening the tunnel by . It is followed by a short cut-and-cover section until the first of the four shafts is reached. The tunnelled section is between shafts 1 and 4, measures long and is lined with cast iron segments.

The tunnel bore was sized to the maximum that the technology of the time allowed. Even then it was recognised this would result in less than ideal lane widths with each lane only in width (modern equivalent road width is ) and footways typically wide on each side of the roadway. The tunnel is shallow, with a maximum gradient of 1 in 36 (2.8%), to cater for non-mechanised traffic. It includes sharp bends at the location of the shafts. This allowed the sections between the shafts to be straight, thus reducing the complexity of construction and avoiding the foundations of the docks. An urban myth is that the bends were installed to prevent horses from seeing daylight at the end of the tunnel too early, which might make them bolt for the exit.

The sharp bends and narrow lanes do however make the tunnel unsuitable for large vehicles. Due to this, and issues with vehicle emissions, Transport for London enforces a ban on vehicles more than 2 metres high or wide. Also banned are vehicles with a maximum authorised mass of over 2 tonnes. In the first eight months of 2021, a total of 75,387 violations were issued, generating over £5m of revenue for TfL.

The speed limit is and is enforced using average speed cameras.

The tunnel bore was originally lined throughout with white glazed tiles, installed by two separate contractors, Boote&#x27;s installed the tiling for north half and Edwards for the south. A band of brown tiles at the centre point of the tunnel demarcated the boundary. After repeated failures of the tiling in the southern half, these were removed in 2011 and replaced with a sprayed gunite surface, detracting significantly the look and feel of the tunnel. The shafts are lined with white glazed bricks, Shaw&#x27;s installing them for shafts 3 and 4 on the north side and Stourbridge for shafts 1 and 2 on the south side. White glazed brickwork is used externally on the approach roads.

A 2003 survey rated the tunnel the tenth most dangerous tunnel in Europe due to its poor safety features. Its proximity to the river also makes it vulnerable to flooding, as happened in the 1928 Thames flood.

==Usage==
Like many other London tunnels and bridges, the tunnel carries far more traffic than it was designed for. Shortly after opening 2,600 vehicles a day, mostly horse-drawn, and 14,000 pedestrians a day were using the tunnel – figures which were seen as easily justifying the expense of its construction. By 1955, usage had quadrupled to 10,500 vehicles a day and by 1997 usage had tripled again, to over 34,000 vehicles a day. The heavy usage, particularly during rush hours, can lead to significant congestion and tailbacks.

The junctions at either side of the tunnel constrain further growth and therefore current traffic levels have remained at 1997 levels. Pedestrian numbers are now very low at around 20 per day, whilst cyclists number between 150 and 200 per day.

The launch of the Ford Model T car only months after the tunnel opened initiated a rapid increase in car ownership and by the late 1920s motor vehicles had all but replaced horse-drawn vehicles, which were banned from the tunnel in 1952. The original ventilation system consisted of two fans supplying fresh air in each of shafts 1 and 4 to a duct below the roadway which in turn feed via 28 grilles spaced evenly along the road into the tunnel. In 1930, following several incidents, including one where 49 people were taken to hospital, the ventilation was upgraded with more powerful fans and extract fans were added in shafts 2 and 3. As traffic has increased, periodically the ventilation fans have been upgraded however the underlying concept has remained the same.

Alternative crossings include Tower Bridge to the west or the Greenwich foot tunnel to the east. Rotherhithe station is almost adjacent to the southern tunnel entrance, and Limehouse (in Ratcliffe Lane) is the closest station to the northern entrance.

Local buses used to pass through the tunnel. Route 82 ran between Stepney East Station (now Limehouse) and St. Marychurch Street in Rotherhithe, before being withdrawn in 1968. The tunnel remained unserved until route P14 commenced in 1988 from Surrey Quays and the Isle of Dogs. This route was withdrawn and partially replaced by a new 395 route in 1999, running from Limehouse (Burdett Road) instead of the Isle of Dogs. The 395 route was withdrawn without replacement on 28 April 2006 due to low passenger usage. By this time, it was the only Transport for London bus route that still used minibuses, in the form of three Mercedes-Benz Sprinters operated by First London, which were necessary due to the tunnel&#x27;s width restriction.

One iteration of the opening credits of the 1970s TV series &quot;The Professionals&quot; feature the Rotherhithe Tunnel whilst the 1951 film &quot;Pool of London&quot; features a police chase scene in the tunnel and shoot-out up and around the shafts. The video for The Specials&#x27; song &quot;Ghost Town&quot; was partially filmed in the tunnel.

<text>Mamaia () is a resort on the Romanian Black Sea shore and a district of Constanța.

Considered to be Romania&#x27;s most popular resort, Mamaia is situated immediately north-east of Constanța&#x27;s city center. It has almost no full-time residents, being populated mostly during the summer.

Mamaia lies on a strip of land in length and only in width, between the Black Sea and Lake Siutghiol.

The beach season is at its best between mid June and early September, when average daytime temperatures range between . The water stays warm until mid autumn.

With an investment of approximately €3.5 million, a gondola lift system was inaugurated in 2004 connecting the entrance from Constanta to the resort and the casino area, spanning 2 km.

Hotels range from mid-end to exclusive 4- and 5-star hotels and private clubs. There are also camping sites in the north.

The 11th reunion of the Central European heads of state took place in Mamaia on 27–28 May 2004.

==Climate==
The district of Mamaia has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with slightly semi-arid influences. The winters are cool with occasional frost in the dawn.
The summers are warm with temperatures seldom exceeding 32°C. 
The rain is regular all year round.

<text>The Greenwich Foot Tunnel crosses beneath the River Thames in East London, linking Greenwich (Royal Borough of Greenwich) on the south bank with Millwall (London Borough of Tower Hamlets) on the north. Approximately 4,000 people use the tunnel (open 24/7) each day. It opened in 1902.

==Design and construction==

The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Sir Alexander Binnie for London County Council and constructed by contractor John Cochrane &amp; Co. The project started in June 1899 and the tunnel opened on 4 August 1902. The tunnel replaced an expensive and sometimes unreliable ferry service allowing workers living south of the Thames to reach their workplaces in the London docks and shipyards in or near the Isle of Dogs. Its creation owed much to the efforts of working-class politician Will Crooks, who had worked in the docks and, after chairing the LCC&#x27;s Bridges Committee responsible for the tunnel, later served as Labour MP for Woolwich.
The entrance shafts at both ends are beneath glazed domes. Lifts, installed in 1904, were upgraded in 1992 and again in 2012, and helical staircases allow pedestrians to access the tile-lined tunnel, which slopes gently from both sides down to a midway lowpoint beneath the river. The cast-iron tunnel is long, deep and has an internal diameter of about . The cast-iron rings are coated with concrete and surfaced with some 200,000 white glazed tiles. The northern end was damaged by bombs during the Second World War and repairs included a thick steel and concrete inner lining that substantially reduces the diameter for a short distance. The northern shaft staircase has 87 steps; the southern one has 100.

===Upgrade works===
Before renovations from 2010 onwards, the attendant-operated lift service was only open from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, and 10 am to 5.30 pm on Sundays, with no service on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. Staff shortages and other problems meant that even during these times the lifts were often unavailable. Since 1999, if the lift was not functioning, anyone unable to use the stairs could take the Docklands Light Railway between Island Gardens DLR station (close to the northern end of the tunnel) and Cutty Sark DLR station (close to the southern end). However, non-folding bicycles are not permitted on the Docklands Light Railway system at peak times.

Greenwich Council started work to upgrade the tunnel on 19 April 2010, intending to reduce leakage, improve drainage and install new lifts, CCTV, communication facilities and signage. Completion was planned for March 2011 but this slipped to September 2011. The tunnel was supposed to be accessible throughout most of the renovations, but it closed completely in February 2011. Stair use was soon regained but lifts remained out of service until early 2012, and remained subject to occasional brief closures during 2012. In October 2012 Greenwich Council acknowledged that the upgrade work had not been completed on time and had run over budget. The work was finally completed and included new customer-operated lifts with surface level availability signs, CCTV coverage, upgraded lighting and renewal or replacement of vital structural components.

The lifts were out of action for a long period in 2021-22 which Greenwich Council attributed to an international supply chain problem affecting the supply of spare parts.

==Location==

The tunnel links
* Greenwich town centre on the south bank of the Thames. Its entrance is close to the prow of the restored clipper &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;.
with
* parts of Docklands including Canary Wharf on the north bank. The tunnel&#x27;s northern entrance is within Island Gardens, a park on the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs, with views across the river to the former Greenwich Hospital, the Queen&#x27;s House and the Royal Greenwich Observatory.

===Coordinates===

* Tower Hamlets entrance: 

==Usage==

A notice at the tunnel entrance states that the tunnel is private property (the Royal Borough of Greenwich manages the Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels on joint behalf of two other partners, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the London Borough of Newham) and not a public right of way. Ordnance Survey maps do not show a right of way on the route of the tunnel. The tunnel is also part of the UK&#x27;s National Cycle Route 1 linking Inverness and Dover. A National Trail, the Thames Path, uses the tunnel to rejoin the southbound part of the path.

A 2016 survey showed that around 4,000 people use the tunnel each day.

The &#x27;Friends of Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels&#x27; (FOGWOFT) was established in September 2013. Following encouragement from FOGWOFT and information from the Institution of Civil Engineers, on 5 July 2016 an interpretative plaque was unveiled near the tunnel&#x27;s Greenwich entrance by the deputy leader of Greenwich council.

===Cycling===

Local bylaws require cyclists to dismount and push their bikes through the tunnel, although plans to remove this requirement have been considered. In 2016, an &#x27;active mobility&#x27; system was installed in the tunnel to monitor and actively manage tunnel usage. The system used computer vision to count and measure the speed of bicycles and pedestrians, and displayed messages on electronic signs to encourage considerate behaviour. The system (also installed in the Woolwich foot tunnel) displayed two messages: &quot;No cycling allowed&quot; (in red text) during busy periods, and &quot;Please consider pedestrians&quot; (in green text) during quiet periods, aiming to make urban shared spaces safer and more pleasant to use for all. The shared spaces trial was supported by Greenwich council but Tower Hamlets refused permission to update the bylaws and the sign system was discontinued; while some cyclists do ride in the tunnel, cycling is still not permitted.

With a continuing impasse in updating the bylaws, FOGWOFT disbanded in March 2021.

<text>Greenwich Park is a former hunting park in Greenwich and one of the largest single green spaces in south-east London. One of the eight Royal Parks of London, and the first to be enclosed (in 1433), it covers , and is part of the Greenwich World Heritage Site. Surrounding the hilltop Royal Observatory (opened in 1676) and straddling the Greenwich Prime Meridian, it commands elevated views over the River Thames, the Isle of Dogs and the City of London.

The park is open year-round, and incorporates flower gardens as well as grassy spaces, a children&#x27;s playground, cafés and other amenities, a bandstand, a boating lake, a pond, wooded areas, and a wildlife habitat called &#x27;The Wilderness&#x27;. The park also contains Roman and Anglo-Saxon remains, and is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens; in 2020, it was awarded a National Lottery grant to restore historic features and add new visitor facilities. It hosted Olympic and Paralympic equestrian events during the London 2012 Summer Olympics, and accommodates runners prior to the start of the annual London Marathon. 

== History ==
===15th–18th centuries===
The estate of some was originally owned by Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Ghent, but reverted to the Crown in 1427 and was given by Henry VI to his uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. He built a house by the river, Bella Court, and a small castle, called Greenwich Castle or Duke Humphrey&#x27;s Tower, on the hill. The former evolved first into the Tudor Palace of Placentia and then into the Queen&#x27;s House and Greenwich Hospital. Greenwich Castle, by now in disrepair, was chosen for the site of the Royal Observatory by Charles II in 1675, on the advice of Sir Christopher Wren.

As a result of this decision, the Greenwich Prime Meridian crosses Greenwich Park, passing due north and south of the Royal Observatory. A stainless steel strip in the Observatory&#x27;s courtyard marks the line; it is also marked on the wall of a path just north of the Observatory and there are wall plaques just outside the park, in Chesterfield Walk to the south and Park Vista to the north. In 1884 it was agreed to be the official Prime Meridian of the world, a status it held for a century until it was superseded by the related IERS Reference Meridian, which runs parallel to the Greenwich Meridian some 102 metres to its east.

In the 15th century the park was mostly heathland and probably used for hawking. In the next century, deer were introduced by Henry VIII for hunting, and a small collection of deer was maintained in an area to the south east. James I enclosed the park with a brick wall, high and two miles (3 km) long at a cost of £2000, much of which remains and defines the modern boundary. A small section of the boundary wall in the southwest corner of the park was formerly part of Montagu House, one time residence of Caroline of Brunswick, demolished in 1815, though Queen Caroline&#x27;s bath (c. 1806) is preserved inside the park. James I also commissioned the first modern ice house in 1619 in the Park.

In the 17th century, the park was landscaped, possibly by André Le Nôtre who is known at least to have designed plans for it. The public were first allowed into the park during the 18th century. Samuel Johnson visited the park in 1763 and commented &quot;Is it not fine?&quot;. From 1730 to 1857, around 250,000 Londoners would attend the bi-annual Greenwich fair (held on May Day and Whitsun); Observatory Hill and nearby One Tree Hill were used on public holidays for mass &#x27;tumbling&#x27;.

===1800–present day===
In the 1830s a railway was nearly driven through the middle of the lower park on a viaduct but the scheme was defeated by intense local opposition. However, the London and Greenwich Railway was later extended beneath the ground via a cut-and-cover tunnel link between Greenwich and Maze Hill which opened in 1878 (the tunnel alignment is on the north side of the park&#x27;s northern boundary wall, running beneath the gardens of the National Maritime Museum and Queen&#x27;s House).

In 1888 the park got a station of its own when Greenwich Park railway station was opened. The station was not successful, with most passengers preferring the older Greenwich station, and in 1917 Greenwich Park station and the associated line closed.

On 15 February 1894, a man died after a bomb explosion in Greenwich Park, close to the Observatory. The victim, Martial Bourdin, was a 26-year-old Frenchman with links to the anarchist Club Autonomie, and was carrying the device when it exploded prematurely. The incident inspired Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;.

During the two World Wars, allotments were sited on the northern edge of the park, south of the Queen&#x27;s House. Agreement for 139 plots for local families to grow vegetables was reached in March 1918, with tenants paying 7s 6d a year each for their plots. Tenants kept their allotments until February 1921 when the park returned to its former use. From 1939, the park was again used for wartime allotments. During World War II anti-aircraft guns were positioned in the park’s flower garden with some tree tops removed to clear the line of fire.

During the London 2012 Summer Olympics, Greenwich Park was the venue for the Olympic equestrian events and for the riding and running parts of the modern pentathlon events. It was also the venue for the Paralympic equestrian events. The use of Greenwich Park for Olympic equestrian events had earlier caused some tension between the London Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games 2012 (LOCOG) and some local area residents. A community action group, NOGOE (No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrian Events), believed Greenwich Park was not a suitable venue for the events and started an (ultimately unsuccessful) petition to get the equestrian events relocated; by February 2009 this had gathered over 12,000 signatures. Olympic use of the park was approved by Greenwich Council in March 2010, with test events held the following year.

In 2021, a £12 million four-year project, &#x27;Greenwich Park Revealed&#x27;, was instigated to reveal, restore, protect and enhance the park&#x27;s past and current features, enhance the park&#x27;s biodiversity, and provide better access for people with disabilities. Supported by a grant of £4,517,300 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the National Lottery Community Fund, the project will remodel the area around the General Wolfe statue viewpoint, restore the &#x27;Grand Ascent&#x27; (a series of giant grass steps, north of the Wolfe statue), restore other landscape features, replant tree avenues, and add a £1.2m learning centre (designed by Architype), a café and other visitor facilities. Several archaeological investigations have been undertaken in parallel with the work, including 2021 and 2022 digs of a Saxon burial mound, a 2023 dig on the site of the &#x27;Grand Ascent&#x27;, a community excavation of a World War II air-raid shelter east of One Tree Hill, and exploration of the remains of John Pond’s Magnetic Observatory, an enclosure built in 1817 to analyse Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

== Geography ==

The park is roughly rectangular in plan with sides 1000 metres by 750 metres and oriented with the long sides lying NNW to SSE. In what follows this direction is taken to be N to S for ease of exposition. It is located at grid reference .

The park is on two levels, with a number of dips and gullies marking the transition between them. The lower level (closest to the National Maritime Museum, Queen&#x27;s House and, beyond them, the Thames) lies to the north; from there a steep walk uphill reveals the southern part – a flat expanse that is, essentially, an enclosed extension of the plateau of Blackheath.

Roughly in the centre, on the top of the hill, is the Royal Observatory and a statue of General James Wolfe (Simon Jenkins rated the view of the Royal Hospital with Canary Wharf in the distance as one of the top ten in England). At the northern edge is the National Maritime Museum and Queen&#x27;s House, and beyond those Greenwich Hospital. To the east is Vanbrugh Castle. To the south is Blackheath and in the south-western corner is the Ranger&#x27;s House, looking out over the heath. To the west lie the architecturally fine streets of Chesterfield Walk and Croom&#x27;s Hill.

==Royal Observatory==
The Observatory is on the top of the hill. Outside is a statue of General James Wolfe (buried in St Alfege Church, Greenwich) in a small plaza from which there are views across to the former Greenwich Hospital (the Old Royal Naval College, now the University of Greenwich) and then towards the river, the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, the City of London to the northwest and The O2 Arena to the north.

==Amenities==

On the lower level of the park there is a popular children&#x27;s playground (north-east corner, close to Maze Hill railway station), an adjacent boating lake, and a small orchard (&#x27;The Queen&#x27;s Orchard&#x27;). There is also a herb garden (close by entrance to Greenwich town centre).

On the upper level, there is an extensive flower garden with a large duck pond, a rose garden, a cricket pitch, tennis courts, a bandstand, Roman remains, an ancient oak tree (known as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Oak, associated with Queen Elizabeth I) many 17th-century sweet chestnut trees with gnarled, swirling trunks, an enclosure (&#x27;The Wilderness&#x27;) used to house wild deer, and an avenue of cherry trees renowned for their spring blossoms.

West of the Observatory is the garden of the former Astronomer Royal, a peaceful secluded space which is good for picnics and also sometimes used by theatre groups (&quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, etc.). On the opposite side (southeast of the Wolfe statue) is the Pavilion Café. There is another, smaller café by the north-west gate, and a snack bar in the children&#x27;s playground; in March 2024, as part of the &#x27;Greenwich Park Revealed&#x27; programme, the Ignatius Sancho Café was opened in a refurbished building by the Vanbrugh Gate on the east side of the park.

It is possible to park (pay and display) in areas along the main roads entering from Blackheath (though it can be busy). Cycle routes criss-cross the park (as do runners, roller-bladers, dog-walkers, etc.). Until 2020, other road traffic (cars and motor-cycles) could use the park road linking Blackheath and Greenwich at peak periods on weekdays. After a trial closure, the road was permanently closed to through traffic in 2022.

==Sport==

One of three start points for the London Marathon, the &#x27;red start&#x27;, is located just south of Greenwich Park, in Charlton Way, with runners held in the park before they start. A London half marathon, Run to the Beat, passed through the park from 2008 to 2012; in 2013, the last running of the 13.1-mile event started and finished in the park. Since 2018 the park has also accommodated some of the finish facilities of The Big Half, a half marathon run each September. A 2.62-miles charity &#x27;mini marathon&#x27; for children is held each May, and the park also hosts occasional commercially organised 5km and 10km running events.

The park also staged the start of the final stage of the 2006 Tour of Britain cycle race (3 September).

A cricket pitch is maintained in the southwest corner of the park, with an adjacent pavilion. Tennis courts are located to the north of the cricket pitch.

==Greenwich Park in popular culture==
Greenwich Park was used for outdoor London scenes including representing the Constitution Hill thoroughfare in the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; starring Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend.

<doc id="333733" wikidata="Q1476445" url="?curid=333733" title="Saab Granturismo">
<text>The Saab Granturismo (also Monte Carlo and Sport) was a series of up-powered sedans sold by Saab Automobile AB from 1958 to 1968. They were powered by three-cylinder, two-stroke engines until the 1967 model year. Most variants were distinguished from the standard model by twin metal stripes along the rocker panels.

==Saab 93-based variant==
The Granturismo 750 was a performance version of the Saab 93, which was introduced at the New York International Auto Show in 1956 and produced until 1960. The Saab 93 offered seat belts in 1958, which only became required on US models in 1973.

The Granturismo model shared multiple features in common with the standard model, including front drum brakes. Upgraded features included a wood-rim steering wheel, a Halda Speedpilot timing device (used in rally racing), sport seats, driving lamps and metal trim along the rocker panels. Rear-hinged doors were offered on the 1958 model year only. Of the 600 Granturismo 750s built in 1958 and 1959, 546 were exported to the US.

Its augmented-output Saab two-stroke engine featured a 9:1 compression ratio, a two-barrel Solex carburetor, a tuned exhaust system, and twin fuel pumps to develop . An optional twin-carburetor Saab Competition tuning kit boosted engine power boosted to . The engine gave most power at high revs, 3400 to 5000 rpm. Engine lubrication was supplied by mixing two-stroke oil with the gasoline in the fuel tank at a three-percent ratio. The gearbox had three speeds. In order to overcome the problem of lubrication for the two-stroke engine when the rpm exceeded that required by the throttle setting (owing to the reduction of oil being delivered with the fuel), a freewheel device was fitted.

==Saab 96-based variants==
Swedish rally champion, Erik Carlsson, won three Royal Automobile Club rallies in a 1960 Saab 96, which became the basis for the 1960 and 1961 Granturismo 750. The Saab 96-based model had a four-speed transmission with freewheeling, and chrome wheel trim and venting rear quarter windows.

It was succeeded by the Saab Sport in 1962, also based on the Saab 96, with slight modifications and with a different interior configuration and equipment. The engine was upgraded to an 841 cc two-stroke three-cylinder engine with one Solex carburetor per cylinder, giving . The engine was lubricated via an oil injection system, fed from a separate tank for two-stroke oil, obviating the need to mix oil with gasoline in the fuel tank. The car also used disc brakes at the front, something that was unusual at the time, and the wheels had four studs instead of the five used on the 96 and were of a stronger build, to withstand the extra workload.

* From 1963 on, the model for the USA market was named Granturismo 850.
* In the 1965 model year power output was raised to .

<doc id="333735" wikidata="Q1538902" url="?curid=333735" title="Pirates (2005 film)">
<text>Pirates is a 2005 American action-adventure film written, produced, and directed by Joone, and produced by Digital Playground and Adam &amp; Eve. The film, starring Jesse Jane, Carmen Luvana, Janine Lindemulder, Devon, Jenaveve Jolie, Teagan Presley, and Evan Stone, features many references to the mainstream Hollywood film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;.

Producer Samantha Lewis stated in an interview that &quot;Pirates&quot; was the most expensive pornographic film made to date, with a reported budget of well over $1 million.

A sequel, &quot;Pirates II: Stagnetti&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was made on an even bigger budget of $8 million, and it is considered the most expensive porn film ever produced.

==Plot==
In 1763, Captain Edward Reynolds is hunting pirates, or at least trying to do so. He does not consider himself a great commander, and neither does most of his crew. Only his first officer Jules believes in him. When they save a young woman named Isabella from drowning, she tells them that her husband&#x27;s ship has been destroyed by the feared Captain Victor Stagnetti and his crew of cutthroat pirates.

Reynolds and his crew go hunting for Stagnetti, who tries to find a map that leads to a powerful secret on an island somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. Stagnetti finds the secret &quot;staff&quot; unlocked by Isabella&#x27;s husband Manuel.

After the crew escapes the spawn of darkness summoned by Stagnetti, their ship engages Stagnetti&#x27;s in battle, ending Stagnetti&#x27;s reign as a pirate.

==Production==
The production was shot using high-definition digital video cameras and featured over 300 special effects shots. It also included an original music score, later released on a separate soundtrack CD, and was mastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Several scenes were shot on board , a replica of , in St. Petersburg, Florida. The owners of the ship were not aware of the true nature of the film, as they were advised that the film being made was a &quot;Disney-type pirate film for families&quot;, a mistaken notion that would continue in video stores after its release.

The film was initially released as a three-disc DVD set (the movie on a standard video DVD, the movie again in a high definition (720P) Windows Media format, and a special features disc) priced as high as $70. An edited R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on July 11, 2006. Digital Playground also released an Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD, a rarity among adult video releases.

The film was also released on Blu-ray Disc (containing only the X-rated version) and HD DVD as one of the first high-definition adult releases on an optical disc format.

== Sequel ==
Evan Stone reported on the extra DVD that there was going to be a sequel. In January 2007, it was reported that a sequel would be produced, directed by Joone and entitled &quot;Pirates II&quot;. A first teaser trailer was presented during the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In March 2008, Digital Playground announced that the sequel would star Belladonna along with Jesse Jane, Evan Stone and many other performers from the first movie, and that it would be released in September 2008.
The second movie was released on September 26, 2008, under the title &quot;Pirates II: Stagnetti&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

==Critical reception==
RogReviews called it &quot;the most talked about adult movie of the year&quot;.

The film set a record by winning 11 AVN Awards (see section below).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a relatively high-budget story of a group of ragtag sailors who go searching for a crew of evil pirates who have a plan for world domination. Also, many of the characters in the movie have sex with one another.&quot;

<text>Thomas Montgomery Newman is an American composer, conductor and orchestrator best known for his many film scores. In a career that has spanned over four decades, he has scored numerous films including &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994), &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; (1998), &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001), &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; and &quot;White Oleander&quot; (both 2002), &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003) and its sequel &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016), &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004), &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (2005), &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), the &quot;James Bond&quot; films &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012) and &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (2015), &quot;1917&quot; (2019), and &quot;Elemental&quot; (2023).

Newman also composed the music for the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2001) and 2003 miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot;. Throughout his career, he has collaborated with directors such as Robert Altman, Jon Avnet, Martin Brest, Frank Darabont, Todd Field, John Lee Hancock, John Madden, Sam Mendes, Andrew Stanton, and Steven Soderbergh.

==Early life and education==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Thomas Montgomery Newman is the youngest son of composer Alfred Newman (1900–1970), who won the Academy Award for Best Original Score nine times, and Martha Louis Montgomery (1920–2005). He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in Hollywood that includes his father Alfred, older brother David Newman, younger sister Maria Newman, uncles Lionel Newman and Emil Newman, cousin Randy Newman, and his first cousin once removed, Joey Newman. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his mother was from Mississippi.

During their upbringing, Martha Newman took her sons to violin lessons in the San Fernando Valley every weekend. 

Newman later studied composition and orchestration for two years at the University of Southern California, before transferring to Yale University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1977 and a Master of Music in 1978. While at Yale, he met composer Stephen Sondheim, who became an early mentor.

==Career==
=== 1983–1992 ===
At first, Newman was more interested in musical theater than in film composition, working with Sondheim in Broadway plays. Lionel, who succeeded Alfred as music director for 20th Century Fox, gave Thomas his first scoring assignment on a 1979 episode of the series &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. In 1983, John Williams, who was a friend of both Alfred and Lionel, invited Newman to work on &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; orchestrating the scene in which Darth Vader dies. Afterward Newman met producer Scott Rudin in New York City and Rudin invited him to compose the score for &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984). Newman said that he thought &quot;it was a tough job, at first&quot; for requiring him to &quot;develop vocabularies and a sense of procedure&quot;, only getting comfortable with writing scores &quot;and not fraudulent in my efforts&quot; after eight years. In 1992, Newman composed the scores for &quot;The Player&quot; and &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;.

=== 1994–1999 ===
In 1994, he received his first Academy Award nominations with the scores for &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Little Women&quot;. He also scored &quot;The War&quot;. In 1996, he scored &quot;Unstrung Heroes&quot;, receiving yet another Oscar nomination. In 1998, he scored &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; as well as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;. In 1999, Newman composed the score to &quot;American Beauty&quot;, created using mainly percussion instruments; this was the first of several collaborations with director Sam Mendes. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the &quot;moral ambiguity&quot; of the script, saying &quot;It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that.&quot;. He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to John Corigliano for &quot;The Red Violin&quot;), he did receive a Grammy and a BAFTA.

=== 2000–2011 ===
His critical and commercial success continued in the years to follow, which included scores for films directed by celebrated independent filmmakers such as Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;), and Todd Field (&quot;In the Bedroom&quot;). He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002; his second collaboration with Sam Mendes), &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), and &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004). However, he lost on each occasion, to Elliot Goldenthal (for &quot;Frida&quot;), Howard Shore (for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;), and Jan A. P. Kaczmarek (for &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;).

In 2006, he teamed once again with Todd Field for &quot;Little Children&quot; and Steven Soderbergh for &quot;The Good German&quot; (and was nominated for latter). At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by Errol Morris, who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times. Newman replied: &quot;No, I&#x27;ve failed seven but this will be my eighth&quot;, and indeed, he again lost, this time to Gustavo Santaolalla for &quot;Babel&quot;.

His first score since &quot;The Good German&quot; was for &quot;Towelhead&quot;. In 2008, he scored the animated film &quot;WALL-E&quot;, collaborating for the second time with director Andrew Stanton (with the first collaboration being &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;). The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had &quot;Nemo&quot;). Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, which he co-wrote with Peter Gabriel. He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, James Newton Howard and Danny Elfman, both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully. Newman lost both the score and song nominations to A. R. Rahman for his work on &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;. He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

In 2008, he also scored &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, a further collaboration with Mendes. In 2009, he scored &quot;Brothers&quot; (the remake of the Susanne Bier film). In 2011, he scored &quot;The Help&quot;, &quot;The Debt&quot;, &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, and &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot;.

=== 2012–present ===
In 2012, Newman scored &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot;, a second collaboration with John Madden after &quot;The Debt&quot;. He also scored the 23rd James Bond movie &quot;Skyfall&quot;, released on the film franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary. His work on this film earned him his eleventh Oscar nomination and a second BAFTA win. During 2013, he scored &quot;Side Effects&quot; (working again with director Steven Soderbergh) and &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;. The latter score was very well received by film music critics, earning Newman BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the second consecutive year, both of which he lost to Steven Price for &quot;Gravity&quot;.

Newman&#x27;s 2014 projects included &quot;The Judge&quot; and &quot;Get on Up&quot;. In 2015, he scored &quot;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot;, marking the first time Newman has scored a sequel to a film he also wrote the score for. Also that year, Newman returned to score the 24th James Bond movie &quot;Spectre&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Skyfall&quot; and a continuation of his longtime collaboration with Sam Mendes. He also worked with Steven Spielberg for &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, marking Newman&#x27;s first collaboration with Spielberg and the first Spielberg film not to feature a musical score from his long-time composer John Williams, since the production of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; in 1985. For his score on &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, Newman garnered additional Oscar and Grammy nominations.

In 2016, Newman scored &quot;Passengers&quot;, for which he received his 14th Oscar nomination. Three years later, Newman reunited with Sam Mendes for his war film &quot;1917&quot;, for which Newman received his 6th BAFTA and 15th Oscar nominations.

Newman likes to vary the instrumentation in his scores, ranging from full orchestra to percussion-only music. He is also fond of incorporating unusual instruments such as the zither, hurdy-gurdy, psaltery and hammered dulcimer, or unexpected sounds, like Aboriginal chants and the chirping of cicadas. The composer declared that he has &quot;an interest in mundane experimentation.&quot;

==Discography==

==Awards and nominations==

Newman has been nominated for fifteen Academy Awards, tying him with fellow composer Alex North for the most nominations without a win. He has also been nominated for four Golden Globes, and has won two BAFTAs, six Grammys and an Emmy Award. Newman was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2000 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music. His achievements have contributed to the Newmans being the most nominated Academy Award extended family, with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.
