<text>Mary Jo Kopechne (; July 26, 1940 – July 18 or 19, 1969) was an American secretary, and one of the campaign workers for U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign, a close team known as the &quot;Boiler Room Girls&quot;. In 1969, she asphyxiated when a car driven by U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy left a narrow road on Chappaquiddick Island and overturned into Poucha Pond after they had left a party. According to reports, Kennedy left the party at 11:15 p.m. Kopechne&#x27;s body and the car were not reported until the next morning, approximately nine to ten hours later.

==Early life and education==
Kopechne was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, although she is sometimes described as being from nearby Forty Fort, Pennsylvania. She was the only child of homemaker Gwen (née Jennings) and insurance salesman Joseph Kopechne. Kopechne was of part-Polish heritage through her father. Her grandfathers both worked as coal miners in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Her family history in the Wyoming Valley area of northeastern Pennsylvania traces back 250 years on her maternal side.

When Kopechne was an infant, her family moved to Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. She was raised Catholic and attended parochial schools, graduating in 1958 from Our Lady of the Valley High School in Orange, New Jersey. She graduated with a degree in business administration from Caldwell College for Women in 1962.

==Career==
Kopechne was inspired by President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural command &quot;Ask what you can do for your country&quot;. After graduation, Kopechne moved to Montgomery, Alabama, for a year at the Mission of St. Jude, which participated in the Civil Rights Movement. She also taught business classes in typing and shorthand at Montgomery Catholic High School, and was an advisor to the school newspaper. One former student recalled her as 
&quot;a petite strawberry blonde with pep in her step. She had confidence and a zest for life that was intriguing. ... She was humble and kind, and stood firm in her beliefs. ... Tough, but fun in the classroom, creating speed challenges, expecting accuracy, and rewarding generously.&quot; 

By 1963, Kopechne relocated to Washington, D.C., to work as secretary for United States Senator George Smathers (D-FL). She joined the secretarial staff of Senator Robert F. Kennedy (D-NY), following his election in November 1964. For that office, she worked as a secretary to the senator&#x27;s speechwriter, and as a legal secretary to one of his legal advisers. Kopechne was a loyal worker. Once, during March 1967, she stayed up all night at Kennedy&#x27;s Hickory Hill home, to type a major speech against the Vietnam War, while the senator and his aides such as Ted Sorensen made last-minute changes to it. She enthusiastically played on the Kennedy office softball team, playing catcher.

During the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Kopechne helped with the wording of Kennedy&#x27;s March speech that announced his presidential candidacy. During his campaign, she worked as one of the Boiler Room Girls; the affectionate nickname given to six young women whose office area was in a hot, loud, windowless location in Kennedy&#x27;s Washington campaign headquarters. They were vital in tracking and compiling data and intelligence on how Democratic delegates from various states were intending to vote; Kopechne&#x27;s responsibilities included Pennsylvania. Kopechne and the other staffers were knowledgeable politically, and were chosen for their ability to work skillfully for long, hectic hours on sensitive matters. They talked daily with field managers, and also helped distribute policy statements to strategic newspapers. She has been described as hero-worshiping the senator.

Kopechne was devastated emotionally by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in June 1968. After working briefly for the Kennedy proxy campaign of George McGovern, she said that she could not return to work on Capitol Hill, saying: &quot;I just feel Bobby&#x27;s presence everywhere. I can&#x27;t go back because it will never be the same again.&quot; But as her father later said, &quot;Politics was her life&quot;. In September 1968, she was hired by Matt Reese Associates, a Washington, D.C., firm that helped establish campaign headquarters and field offices for politicians, and was one of the first political consulting companies. In the fall elections of 1968, Kopechne did work on the re-election campaign of Senator Joseph S. Clark, Jr. (D-PA), who eventually lost. 

She was also assigned to recruit volunteers in Colorado for former Governor Stephen McNichols&#x27;s run for the Senate against incumbent Senator Peter H. Dominick (R). McNichols lost his run, and Kopechne returned to Washington, D.C. By mid-1969, she had completed work for the eventually successful mayoral campaign of Thomas J. Whelan in Jersey City, New Jersey. She was on her way to a successful professional career; one of the political professionals who worked with her in Jersey City characterized her as &quot;an exceptionally hard-working and skillful professional who knew her craft&quot;.

Kopechne lived with three other women in the Washington neighborhood of Georgetown. She was a fan of the Boston Red Sox, and of fellow Polish American Carl Yastrzemski. She was a devout Roman Catholic, with a demure, serious, &quot;convent school&quot; demeanor, and rarely drank much.

==Death==

On July 18, 1969, Kopechne attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island, off the east coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The celebration was in honor of the dedicated work of the Boiler Room Girls, and was the fourth such reunion of Robert Kennedy campaign workers. Robert&#x27;s surviving brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, was there. Kopechne reportedly left the party with Kennedy at 11:15 p.m.; according to his account, he had offered to drive her to catch the last ferry back to Edgartown, where she was staying. She did not tell her close friends at the party that she was leaving, and she left her purse and keys behind. Kennedy drove the 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88 off a narrow, unlit bridge, which lacked guardrails and was not on the route to Edgartown. The vehicle landed on its roof in Poucha Pond. Kennedy extricated himself from the vehicle and survived, but neglected to inform authorities of the accident until the next day.

Assistant Medical examiner Donald Mills signed a death certificate, listing cause of death as accidental drowning. A private funeral for Kopechne was held at St. Vincent&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, on July 22, 1969. The service was attended by Kennedy, his wife Joan, his sister-in-law Ethel, and hundreds of onlookers. Kopechne was buried in St. Vincent&#x27;s Cemetery in Larksville, Pennsylvania, in the parish cemetery on the side of Larksville Mountain. She was among the fifth generation of her family interred in that cemetery.

The exact time and cause of Kopechne&#x27;s death is not positively known, due to conflicting witness testimony at the January 1970 inquest, and lack of an autopsy.
* Kennedy claimed the accident occurred shortly after he left the party at 11:15p.m. on July 18. But part-time Deputy Sheriff Christopher &quot;Huck&quot; Look testified that he saw Kennedy&#x27;s car, with Kopechne and Kennedy in it, around 12:40a.m. on July 19.
* John Farrar, the fire rescue captain who retrieved the body on July 19, testified he believed that Kopechne stayed alive for up to half an hour in an air pocket, and ultimately suffocated in the submerged vehicle. A petition to exhume the body for autopsy was denied by a Pennsylvania court.

Kennedy failed to report the incident to the authorities until the car and Kopechne&#x27;s body were discovered the next morning. Kopechne&#x27;s parents said that they learned of their daughter&#x27;s death from Kennedy, before he informed authorities of his involvement. They learned that Kennedy had been the driver from wire press releases some time later.

==Aftermath==
A week after the incident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident after causing injury. He received a two-month suspended sentence. On a national television broadcast that night, Kennedy said that he had not been driving &quot;under the influence of liquor&quot;, nor had he ever had a &quot;private relationship&quot; with Kopechne. Massachusetts officials pressed for weeks to have Kopechne&#x27;s body exhumed for an autopsy, but in December 1969, a Pennsylvania judge sided with the parents&#x27; request not to disturb her burial site.

The Chappaquiddick incident and Kopechne&#x27;s death became the topic of at least 15 non-fiction books, as well as a novella by Joyce Carol Oates. Even otherwise sympathetic, mainstream biographers believed there were outstanding serious questions about Kennedy&#x27;s timeline of events that night, specifically his actions following the incident. The quality of the investigation has been scrutinized, particularly whether official deference was given to a powerful and influential politician and his family. The events surrounding Kopechne&#x27;s death damaged Kennedy&#x27;s reputation, and are regarded as a major reason why he was never able to mount a successful campaign for President of the United States and essentially chose not to pursue the office.
Kennedy would eventually overcome this and some lesser personal scandals to have a very long career as a Senator and to achieve a lengthy list of major legislative accomplishments.

Kennedy expressed his remorse over his role in Kopechne&#x27;s death in his posthumously published memoir, &quot;True Compass&quot; (2009). But the disparity of the outcomes remained; Kennedy biographer Peter Canellos has written of the aftermath: &quot;Every day that he lived was one that Kopechne – a talented woman with political interests of her own – would not. It seemed cosmically unfair that he should have a second act when she couldn&#x27;t even complete her first.&quot;

Kopechne&#x27;s parents received a $141,000 settlement from Kennedy&#x27;s insurance company. They subsequently moved to Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. On the 25th anniversary of her death, in 1994, they said that Kennedy had never apologized directly to them over his role in it, but that other members of the Kennedy family had written letters to them. With their only child gone, they never felt that justice had really been done in the case.

Kopechne&#x27;s father died in a nursing home in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, in 2003. Her mother died in a nursing home in Plains Township, Pennsylvania, in 2007.

==Legacy==
In 2015, two cousins of Kopechne&#x27;s in Pennsylvania self-published the book &quot;Our Mary Jo&quot;, which sought to emphasize the influence of her life, rather than discuss Kennedy or Chappaquiddick. It also includes some of the hundreds of condolence letters that Kopechne&#x27;s parents received. Because Kopechne had been a strong believer in education and was deeply Catholic, family members started a scholarship fund in Kopechne&#x27;s name at nearby Misericordia University.

In 2017, Kopechne was portrayed by actress Kate Mara in John Curran&#x27;s film &quot;Chappaquiddick&quot;. Mara gives Kopechne a sympathetic interpretation, although much of the film takes place after her death.

A full biography, &quot;Before Chappaquiddick: The Untold Story of Mary Jo Kopechne&quot; (2020), was written by William C. Kashatus and published by Potomac Books. Kashatus has said that he spent more than a decade researching the work, inspired by Kopechne as an exemplar of the culture of the Wyoming Valley area, 
&quot;where the people have a strong work ethic, very strongly Catholic at that period of time, and they raised their kids to respect themselves, respect other people, and work hard. And she really represented that to me.&quot;

<doc id="325612" wikidata="Q3716949" url="?curid=325612" title="Twilight sleep">
<text>Twilight sleep (English translation of the German word ) is an amnesic state characterized by insensitivity to pain with or without the loss of consciousness, induced by an injection of morphine and scopolamine, with the purpose of pain management during childbirth. The obstetric method originated in Germany and gained large popularity in New York City in the early 20th century.

==Effects and usage==
In the Freiburg technique, considered the gold standard of twilight birth, patients were first given an intramuscular injection of of scopolamine and of morphine. Forty five minutes later, a second scopolamine injection of the same dosage was administered. A memory test was then given, and subsequent smaller doses of scopolamine were given based on the individual&#x27;s performance on the memory tests. When performed properly, the drug combination caused a drowsy state and relieved the pain only partially, whilst creating amnesia such that the woman giving birth sometimes would not remember any pain, although these results were variable. Because of how variable the scopolamine dosages are between patients, and the need for accurate assessment of performance on the memory test, the twilight sleep method required skillful, well-trained practitioners for proper execution.

To effectively keep women in an amnesic state, sensory isolation was necessary. Women gave birth in a darkened room, and the birth attendants wore uniforms designed to minimize noise. Women were sometimes blind-folded, had their ears plugged with oil-soaked cotton, or were tied to padded beds with leather straps to &quot;promote sleep.&quot; Sensory deprivation also prevented delirium, one of the adverse side effects of scopolamine.

==History==

=== Pain management in labor ===
Prior to the 20th century, childbirth predominantly happened in the home, without access to any medical interventions for pain management. Doctors (primarily, if not all men) were now managing the vast majority of childbirths as opposed to midwives or Doulas. Many women were fearful of the process of giving birth, creating a large desire for pain management. But despite the demands of female patients, little relief was offered before the mid-19th century. Chemical anesthesia during labor was first introduced in 1847, receiving support from women and reluctance from physicians. The legacy of the Bible in the Anglo-American medical community was clear. While pain relief was seen as a necessary part of surgery, many physicians viewed painful childbirth as a natural, divinely ordained punishment for Eve’s behavior in the Garden of Eden. Anesthesia&#x27;s use was popularized in 1853 by Queen Victoria’s decision to use chloroform for pain relief during the birth of her eighth child, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.

=== Germany ===
In 1899, a Dr Schneiderlin recommended the use of hyoscine and morphine for surgical anesthesia, and it began to be used as such sporadically. The use of this combination to ease birth was first proposed by Austrian physician Richard von Steinbuchel in 1902, before being picked up and further developed by Carl Gauss and Bernhardt Kronig in Freiburg, Germany, beginning in 1903. The method came to be known as (&quot;twilight sleep&quot;) or the &quot;Freiburg method&quot; when performed according to Gauss and Kronig&#x27;s specific technique. Gauss and Kronig&#x27;s research showed that the use of scopolamine during childbirth resulted in fewer complications and a faster recovery. The two presented their findings on the use of scopolamine during childbirth at the 1906 National Obstetrics Conference in Berlin, Germany. They recorded preferred dosages and adverse side effects of scopolamine, which included slowed pulse, bradypnea, delirium, dilated pupils, flushed skin, and thirst.

Its usage spread slowly, and different clinics experimented with different dosages and ingredients. By 1907, Gauss was performing the Freiburg method on all of his pregnant patients, and wealthy German women began to travel to Freiburg for childbirth to receive Kronig and Gauss&#x27;s twilight sleep method. The Women&#x27;s Clinic of the State University of Baden, where Gauss was a physician, had the city&#x27;s lowest rates of maternal and neonatal mortality, further increasing the procedure&#x27;s popularity. Eventually, wealthy pregnant women from the United States began traveling to Germany to receive twilight sleep during childbirth.

=== Popularity in New York City ===
A June 1914 &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article titled, &quot;Painless Childbirth&quot; published by Marguerite Tracy and Constance Leupp about twilight sleep was instrumental in increasing awareness of the procedure in the United States. The article garnered a massive public response, prompting thousands of women to write the magazine asking for information about doctors able to perform the method. In the year after the publication of the &quot;McClure&quot; article, several books such as &quot;Motherhood without Pain&quot; were published that universally praised the procedure. Newspapers and magazines began pressuring American obstetricians to adopt the method of pain management in their own clinics. Twilight sleep gained a &quot;faddish&quot; popularity in New York City from 1914 to 1916.

In 1915, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an article on twilight sleep and the work of Hanna Rion Ver Beck, who had recently written a book entitled &quot;The Truth About Twilight Sleep&quot;. In that article, Beck said that the consensus of 69 medical reports she had looked at said that &quot;scopolamin-morphin is without danger to the child&quot;.

Despite its popularity among patients, twilight sleep faced serious resistance from American doctors. Many physicians accused Gauss and Kronig of propagandizing women for financial gain. Because the treatment&#x27;s greatest popularity overlapped with World War I, women who advocated for the German technique were also accused of being disloyal to the United States.

=== Decline ===
The use of twilight sleep began to decline in the United States after 1916 due to a number of factors. In the setting of New York City, it was extremely difficult to perform properly according to the Freiburg method. The dosages of morphine and scopolamine needed to be precise to avoid overdose, and NYC hospitals typically lacked the private, quiet birthing rooms like those used in Freiburg for sensory isolation. At its peak, there was such demand from women for twilight sleep that many physicians who were not adequately trained in the technique felt that the success of their obstetric practices depended on offering it. Thus, many untrained nurses and physicians were administering morphine and scopolamine at improper dosages, leading to a high rate of errors. Also contributing was the fact that twilight sleep did not actually cause a painless childbirth—the scopolamine produced amnesia, so the user did not remember the pain.

== Relationship with first-wave feminism ==
Twilight sleep spread in popularity in New York through a grassroots female-led campaign that was closely connected to the first-wave feminism movement. Many of those active in the campaign were also suffragists, and they used techniques learned in the suffrage movement to increase awareness of twilight sleep.

The procedure was initially heralded as the dawning of &quot;a new era for woman and through her for the whole human race.&quot; Advocates of twilight birth, including Hanna Rion, saw the fight for pain management in childbirth as strongly connected to the fight for gender equality. They described childbirth as &quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;unnecessary&quot; and believed that male physicians did not adequately recognize the difficulties of maternity. Twilight sleep was seen as liberating women from the danger and pain imposed on them by their own bodies.

Early feminists in Manhattan formed the National Twilight Sleep Association in 1914, which advocated for wider use. They organized pro-twilight sleep materials, lectures, and encouraged local New York physicians to offer the practice; articles appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; praising twilight birth. A moving picture showing the procedure, one of the first medical movies, was also created and screened for interested women. Prominent NTSA member Mary Boyd&#x27;s lectures about twilight sleep would draw crowds of nearly 300 women. She would end her lectures with the campaign&#x27;s popular saying: “You women… will have to fight for it, for the mass of doctors are opposed to it.” Boyd and Tracy saw twilight sleep as a turning point in medicine, describing it as the “first time… that the whole body of patients have risen to dictate to the doctors.”

The campaign dwindled after one of its leaders, Frances X. Carmody, died of hemorrhage giving birth while using twilight sleep, though her husband and doctor asserted that her death was unrelated to the use of twilight sleep.

== Long-term impacts on obstetrics ==
While twilight sleep began to wane in popularity after 1915, it permanently altered obstetric care and created irrevocable changes in the role of obstetricians in the United States. Obstetricians could no longer have a financially viable practice that did not include pain management during childbirth. The use of morphine and scopolamine in twilight birth also positioned drug intervention as the main measure used in pain management during labor. Because twilight birth was performed in a hospital setting, it greatly contributed to changing childbirth from a home event to a medicalized hospital procedure. The twilight birth fad accelerated the decrease in perceived importance of midwives and presented male physicians as those best qualified to assist in delivery, giving doctors more control over the birthing process. The twilight birth movement also illustrates the power of public demand and media coverage in shaping the popularity of certain obstetric techniques.

<text>Panzerschreck ( &quot;tank&#x27;s dread&quot; or &quot;tank&#x27;s bane&quot;) was the popular name for the &quot;Raketenpanzerbüchse&quot; 54 (&quot;Rocket Anti-armor Rifle Model 54&quot;, abbreviated to RPzB 54), an 88 mm reusable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by Nazi Germany in World War II. Another earlier, official name was &quot;Ofenrohr&quot; (&quot;stove pipe&quot;).

The &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; was designed as a lightweight infantry anti-tank weapon and was an enlarged copy of the American bazooka. The weapon was shoulder-launched and fired a fin-stabilized rocket with a shaped-charge warhead. It was made in smaller numbers than the &quot;Panzerfaust&quot;, which was a light, disposable anti-tank weapon that used a system akin to recoilless rifles.

==History==


The &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; development was initially based on the American &quot;bazooka&quot;, captured during the Tunisian campaign, November 1942. The &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; was larger and heavier than its American counterpart – the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; had an 88 mm calibre, compared to the 57 mm calibre of the bazooka – allowing it to penetrate thicker armour, but also required a larger motor, creating more smoke when firing.

Calibre 88 mm was selected as the existing RPzB. Gr. 4312 for &quot;8.8 cm Raketenwerfer 43&quot; was reused for &quot;Panzerschreck&quot;. Warhead and fuzing was carried over, but the rocket motor&#x27;s housing needed lengthening from to to accommodate the longer rocket motor. &quot;Raketenwerfer 43&quot; had percussion firing, whereas for the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; an electrical priming was selected, forming standard grenade RPzB. Gr. 4322. Other munitions were developed, including drill dummy, practice live rocket with inert warhead and standard grenade with improved contact system.

The earliest production model of the RPzB 54 was long and weighed about when empty. Unlike the rockets used in American bazookas which extinguished before leaving the tube, the RPzB rockets kept burning for about after exiting the tube. Users were instructed to wear heavy gloves, a protective poncho and a gas mask without a filter to protect them from the heat of the backblast when the weapon was fired. Improvised shields were made to protect the user and in February 1944, the RPzB 54 was fitted with an official blast shield to protect the operator which made the weapon heavier, weighing empty. Small numbers of the shortened &quot;RPzB 54/1&quot; were later produced. It had an improved rocket, a shorter barrel, and a range increased to about .

Firing the RPzB generated copious amounts of smoke both in front of and behind the weapon. Because of the weapon&#x27;s tube and smoke produced, official documentation named the weapon the &quot;Ofenrohr&quot; (&quot;stove pipe&quot;). This also meant that anti-tank teams were revealed once they fired, making them targets and, therefore, required them to shift positions after firing. This type of system also made it problematic to fire the weapon from inside closed spaces (such as bunkers or houses), filling the room with toxic smoke and revealing the firing location immediately.

Late war German tactical doctrine called for &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; and/or &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; teams to set up in staggered trenches no further than apart. In this way, attacking armor would face anti-tank fire from multiple directions at a distance of no more than . Anti-tank teams were instructed to aim for the thinner side or rear armor whenever possible. Allied armored units frequently attempted to add improvised protection to their tanks, e.g., sandbags, spare track units, logs and so on to protect against HEAT rounds. Another defense was to rig metal mesh and netting around the tank, resembling the German &quot;Schürzen&quot; auxiliary plates. In practice about 1 meter of air gap were required to substantially reduce the penetrating capability of RPzB, thus skirts and sandbags were entirely ineffective against RPzB and Panzerfaust.

In 1944, Germany provided the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; to Finland, which used it to great effect against Soviet armour. The Finnish name for the weapon was &quot;Panssarikauhu&quot; (literal translation of the German name).

The Italian Social Republic and Hungary also used the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot;. Several Italian units became known as skilled anti-tank hunters and the Hungarians used the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; extensively during Operation Spring Awakening.

<doc id="325617" wikidata="Q191031" url="?curid=325617" title="Mob rule">
<text>Mob rule or ochlocracy or mobocracy is a pejorative term describing an oppressive majoritarian form of government controlled by the common people through the intimidation of more legitimate authorities. Ochlocracy is distinguished from democracy or similarly legitimate and representative governments by the absence or impairment of a procedurally civil process reflective of the entire polity.
== Names ==
Ochlocracy comes from Latin , from Greek (&quot;okhlokratía&quot;), from (&quot;ókhlos&quot;, &quot;mass&quot;, &quot;mob&quot;, or &quot;common people&quot;) and (&quot;krátos&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;). An ochlocrat is one who is an advocate or partisan of ochlocracy. The adjective may be either ochlocratic or ochlocratical.

Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to mob rule or , which was coined in the 18th century from the sense of &quot;mob&quot; meaning the common rabble that arose from the Latin phrase (&quot;the fickle crowd&quot;) in the 1680s during disputes over the United Kingdom&#x27;s Glorious Revolution.

== Origin ==
Polybius appears to have coined the term ochlocracy in his 2nd century BC work &quot;Histories&quot; (6.4.6). He uses it to name the &quot;pathological&quot; version of popular rule, in opposition to the good version, which he refers to as democracy. There are numerous mentions of the word &quot;ochlos&quot; in the Talmud, in which &quot;ochlos&quot; refers to anything from &quot;mob&quot;, &quot;populace&quot;, to &quot;armed guard&quot;, as well as in the writings of Rashi, a Jewish commentator on the Bible. The word was first recorded in English in 1584, derived from the French &quot;ochlocratie&quot; (1568), which stems from the original Greek &quot;okhlokratia&quot;, from &quot;okhlos&quot; (&quot;mob&quot;) and &quot;kratos&quot; (&quot;rule&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;strength&quot;).

Ancient Greek political thinkers regarded ochlocracy as one of the three &quot;bad&quot; forms of government (tyranny, oligarchy, and ochlocracy) as opposed to the three &quot;good&quot; forms of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. They distinguished &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; according to whether the government form would act in the interest of the whole community (&quot;good&quot;) or in the exclusive interests of a group or individual at the expense of justice (&quot;bad&quot;).

Polybius&#x27; predecessor, Aristotle, distinguished between different forms of democracy, stating that those disregarding the rule of law devolved into ochlocracy. Aristotle&#x27;s teacher, Plato, considered democracy itself to be a degraded form of government and the term is absent from his work.

The threat of &quot;mob rule&quot; to a democracy is restrained by ensuring that the rule of law protects minorities or individuals against short-term demagoguery or moral panic. However, considering how laws in a democracy are established or repealed by the majority, the protection of minorities by rule of law is questionable. Some authors, like the Bosnian political theoretician Jasmin Hasanović, connect the emergence of ochlocracy in democratic societies with the decadence of democracy in neo-liberal Western societies, in which &quot;the democratic role of the people has been reduced mainly to the electoral process&quot;.

==History==
During the late 17th and the early 18th centuries, English life was very disorderly. Although the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s rising of 1685 was the last rebellion, there was scarcely a year in which London or the provincial towns did not see aggrieved people breaking out into riots. In Queen Anne&#x27;s reign (1702–14) the word &quot;mob&quot;, first heard of not long before, came into general use. With no police force, there was little public order. Several decades later, the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots swept through London and claimed hundreds of lives; at the time, a proclamation painted on the wall of Newgate prison announced that the inmates had been freed by the authority of &quot;His Majesty, King Mob&quot;.

The Salem Witch Trials in colonial Massachusetts during the 1690s, in which the unified belief of the townspeople overpowered the logic of the law, also has been cited by one essayist as an example of mob rule.

In 1837, Abraham Lincoln wrote about lynching and &quot;the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country – the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice.&quot;

Mob violence played a prominent role in the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement. Examples include the expulsions from Missouri, the Haun&#x27;s Mill massacre, the death of Joseph Smith, the expulsion from Nauvoo, the murder of Joseph Standing, and the Cane Creek Massacre. In an 1857 speech, Brigham Young gave an address demanding military action against &quot;mobocrats.&quot;

<doc id="325618" wikidata="Q6074210" url="?curid=325618" title="Irven DeVore">
<text>Irven DeVore (October 7, 1934 – September 23, 2014) was an anthropologist and evolutionary biologist, and Curator of Primatology at Harvard University&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. He headed Harvard&#x27;s Department of Anthropology from 1987 to 1992. He taught generations of students at Harvard both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. He mentored many young scientists who went on to prominence in anthropology and behavioral biology, including Richard Lee, Robert Trivers, Sarah Hrdy, Peter Ellison, Barbara Smuts, Henry Harpending, Marjorie Shostak, Robert Bailey, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, Richard Wrangham and Terrence Deacon.

==Early life and career==

DeVore grew up in Joy, Texas, and attended the University of Texas for his undergraduate studies. He later pursued his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago upon receiving the Danford Scholarship, which paid the full costs for his and his wife&#x27;s, Nancy DeVore, graduate education. DeVore went on to do field research on the behavior and ecology of baboons in 1959, at the same time Jane Goodall was doing her research on chimpanzees and Robert Ardrey was writing &quot;African Genesis&quot; (1961), a book that DeVore used to use as an example of how not to explain human evolution scientifically. DeVore&#x27;s own mentor was Sherwood Washburn, a distinguished physical anthropologist and primatologist whom DeVore followed from the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1962, to the University of California at Berkeley, where he held a prestigious Miller Fellowship. Under Washburn&#x27;s wing, he carried out pioneering studies of baboon behavior and ecology, and in 1965 published a collection of research chapters on various primates, a volume under DeVore&#x27;s editorship that helped define the field of behavioral primatology. His many field trips to the baboons were a natural focus for a young man who, growing up in and around Joy, Texas, had steeped himself in nature. Throughout life he was known for delightedly adopting odd pets, and his trips to Africa put him back in touch with the natural world he had loved since childhood.

==Ethnographic work==

However, by the mid-&#x27;60s he had turned his attention to humans, through his collaboration with Richard B. Lee. Together they organized (despite their youth) an influential international conference called &quot;Man the Hunter&quot;, which included Claude Lévi-Strauss in cultural anthropology, Lewis Binford in archeology, and other experts in disciplines relevant to hunter-gatherer studies, a sub-field Lee and DeVore helped create. The conference led to a landmark book in 1968; although the title seemed anachronistic within a few years, the book posited that women were the main breadwinners in that type of society.

Meanwhile, Lee and DeVore had also made their first, exploratory visit to northwestern Botswana, where they contacted San (or &quot;Bushman&quot;) people who were still hunting and gathering for a living. Together they mounted a years-long, multidisciplinary project to study the way of life of the group known as the !Kung or Ju/&#x27;hoansi, involving a number of graduate students and visiting scientists. The study became a model for multidisciplinary anthropological field work, which DeVore often contrasted with the classic approach of &quot;one ethnographer with his people against the sky.&quot; He did not shrink from making barbed statements and he cast a narrow critical shadow, but for those whose work he liked, his support was legendary. DeVore&#x27;s kind of field research was more expensive, but he was vigorous and successful in raising grant funds for research that he believed in, by himself and others.

In the late 1970s he began another major multidisciplinary study, together with Robert Bailey and Nadine Peacock, among the small-stature hunter-gatherers of the Ituri rain forest. This too produced a stream of monographs and scientific papers that contributed to our understand of this way of life, which DeVore believed shed light on the human past. This claim became widely accepted. DeVore was sometimes accused of treating the San and Ituri people as relics of that past, but he always explained that they were people like us who happened to still be subsisting in this very old way.

==Evolutionary theory==

DeVore, not one to shy away from controversy, was also an early enthusiast of the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, fostering their development through mentoring and teaching as well as through interviews, lectures, debates, and writing for scientific and popular audiences. He became an advocate for the evolutionary biological approach after being one of the few to listen to the ideas of Robert Trivers, who was shunned due to his mental illness. Several years into this new way of looking at animal and human behavior, DeVore was asked whether the data were really supporting it. He liked to say, &quot;The data are sitting up and begging.&quot; By the turn of the millennium sociobiology and evolutionary psychology had become normal science, although still controversial. One of the painful consequences for DeVore in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s was that his mentor and close friend, &quot;Sherry&quot; Washburn, was a bitter opponent of the new approach. They eventually reconciled, but never agreed.

DeVore had a sometimes caustic but compelling personality and intellect that worked their influence in and out of the classroom. He appeared on many television programs as an expert or narrator. He played an instrumental role in developing supplementary school curricula, one of which, &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS) became a subject of Congressional debate because of its emphasis on evolution. The son of an itinerant Methodist preacher in East Texas, DeVore had sold Bibles door-to-door for a time as a very young man, but when he became convinced of the validity of Darwin&#x27;s theory, he taught and defended it with what many said was a compelling art of persuasion.

He suggested that, due to sexual selection, &quot;Males are basically a breeding experiment run by females&quot; and that &quot;Males are the safest, most consistent way to contribute variation to the system...&quot;

Irven DeVore once said that &quot;There is no excuse for boring students when you&#x27;re talking about human nature. It&#x27;s too interesting.&quot; He taught in large lecture halls that were perennially full as well as in the smaller but influential &quot;Simian Seminar,&quot; which met in his living room on Wednesday evenings, in his rambling, comfortable home on a quiet wooded street in Cambridge. Leading or rising figures in the fields he was interested in came to address the seminar, which was a center of intellectual ferment in those fields for decades.

Through these seminars, the ideas of evolutionary biology rose to prominence as group selection (with regard to explaining behaviour) faded, albeit not directly through Irven&#x27;s work. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, two attendees of the seminars, stated &quot;DeVore&#x27;s intellectual impact is less well known because his ideas were realized through his students and colleagues.&quot;

==Personal life and awards==

He was an avid and widely published photographer, and his photos became part of the core collection of AnthroPhoto, an agency founded by his wife, Nancy DeVore, and now managed by his daughter, Claire. The agency is known for the scientific authenticity of the photos and accompanying information. DeVore also made or helped to make numerous documentary and educational films about baboons and other subjects.

DeVore was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Anthropological Association. He won the Walker Prize for Science of the Museum of Science, Boston, and the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Institute of Human Origins. He helped lay the foundations of Harvard&#x27;s Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, which became independent of the Department of Anthropology in 2009, some years after DeVore&#x27;s retirement.

On September 3, 2014, DeVore died of heart failure. He lived through the death of his son, Gregory, in 2003. His wife, Nancy, died several months after her husband. DeVore is survived by his daughter, Claire, and his four grandchildren who remain in Massachusetts.

<doc id="325620" wikidata="Q753499" url="?curid=325620" title="WWV (radio station)">
<text>WWV is a shortwave (&quot;high frequency&quot; or HF) radio station, located near Fort Collins, Colorado. It has broadcast a continuous time signal since 1945, and implements United States government frequency standards, with transmitters operating on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 MHz. WWV is operated by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), under the oversight of its Time and Frequency Division, which is part of NIST&#x27;s Physical Measurement Laboratory based in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

WWV was established in 1919 by the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., making it one of the oldest continuously-operating radio stations in the United States. NIST celebrated WWV&#x27;s centennial on October 1, 2019.

In 1931, the station relocated to the first of three suburban Maryland sites, before moving to a location near Fort Collins in 1966. WWV shares this site with longwave (also known as &quot;low frequency&quot; or LF) station WWVB, which transmits carrier and time code (no voice) at 60 kHz. NIST also operates shortwave station WWVH on Kauai, Hawaii. Both WWV and WWVH announce the time of day each minute in Coordinated Universal Time, and make other recorded announcements of general interest on an hourly schedule, including the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation status. Because they simultaneously transmit on the same frequencies, WWV uses a male voice in order to differentiate itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice.

==Service==

Since 1945, WWV has disseminated &quot;official U.S. time&quot; provided by government entities NIST and the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. WWV provides a public service by making time information freely available at all hours.

The time signals generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as radio-controlled clocks, weather stations and wristwatches to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accurate time plays a vital role in daily operations including shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and telecommunications. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as amateur radio operators, who use the station&#x27;s transmissions to test their equipment.

===Transmission system===


WWV broadcasts over six transmitters, each one dedicated to a single frequency. The transmitting frequencies and time signals of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, along with the four atomic (cesium) clocks from which their time signals are derived, are maintained by NIST&#x27;s Time and Frequency Division, which is based in nearby Boulder, Colorado. WWVB&#x27;s carrier frequency is maintained to an accuracy of 1 part in 1014 and can be used as a frequency reference. The broadcast time is accurate to within of UTC and of the national time standard.
The transmitters for 2.5 MHz and 20 MHz have an ERP of 2.5 kW, while those for the other three frequencies use 10 kW of ERP. Each transmitter has a dedicated antenna, with a height corresponding to one-half of its wavelength, and an omnidirectional signal radiation pattern. The top half of each antenna tower has a quarter-wavelength radiating element, and the bottom half uses nine guy wires, connected to the midpoint of the tower and sloped at one-to-one from the ground—with a length of times the wavelength—as additional radiating elements.

===Telephone service===
WWV&#x27;s time signal can be accessed by telephone by calling +1 (303) 499-7111 (WWV). Telephone calls are limited to 2 minutes, and the signal is delayed by an average of 30 milliseconds due to telephone network propagation time.

==History==
===Establishment===
The earliest formal record of WWV&#x27;s existence is in the October 1, 1919 issue of the Department of Commerce&#x27;s &quot;Radio Service Bulletin&quot;, where it was listed as a new &quot;experimental station&quot; assigned to the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., with the randomly issued call letters of WWV. However, there were also earlier reports of radio demonstrations by the Bureau, starting the previous February.

As of May 1920 the Bureau&#x27;s Radio Laboratory was reported to be conducting weekly Friday evening concerts from 8:30 to 11:00, transmitting on 600 kHz. That same month, the Bureau demonstrated a portable radio receiver, called the &quot;portaphone&quot;, which was said to be capable of receiving broadcast programs up to away. A newspaper article the following August reported that the weekly concerts could be heard up to from Washington. It also noted that &quot;The bureau has been experimenting with the wireless music for several months, and has reached such an advanced stage of development that further investigation to them is useless, and they are going to discontinue the concerts.&quot; However, the station continued to make occasional broadcasts, and in January 1921 a new distance record was announced when a listener in Chattanooga, Tennessee reported hearing the &quot;jazzy waves whirling out from the Bureau of Standards&quot;.

On December 15, 1920, WWV began broadcasting 500-word &quot;Daily Radio Marketgrams&quot;, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Markets, in Morse code on 750 kHz, which reportedly could be heard up to from Washington. However, on April 15, 1921 responsibility for the reports was transferred to four stations operated by the Post Office Department, including its WWX in Washington, D.C.

===Standard frequency transmissions===
At the end of 1922, WWV&#x27;s purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals. These were an important aid to broadcasting and amateur stations, because their equipment limitations at the time meant they had difficulty staying on their assigned frequencies. Testing began on January 29, 1923. Regularly scheduled operations began on March 6, 1923, consisting of seven transmitting frequencies ranging from 550 to  kHz (wavelengths of 545 to 200 meters). The frequencies were accurate to &quot;better than three-tenths of one percent&quot;. At first, the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next, using a wavemeter. The first quartz resonators (that stabilized the frequency generating oscillators) were invented in the mid-1920s, and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV&#x27;s frequency broadcasts. 
In 1926, WWV was nearly shut down. Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States, and other stations located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station&#x27;s impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5 MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.

WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6, 1940. The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered, and the station was back on the air (with reduced power) on November 11. Congress funded a new station in July 1941, and it was built south of the former location, still referred to as Beltsville (although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt, Maryland). WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 MHz on August 1, 1943.

===Time signal transmissions===
Beginning in 1913 the primary official time station broadcasting in the eastern United States was the Navy&#x27;s NAA in Arlington, Virginia. NAA was decommissioned in 1941. WWV began broadcasting second pulses in 1937, but these were not initially synchronized to actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO clock as a source for its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Audio frequencies of 600 Hz and 440 Hz were employed during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 MHz. The 30 and 35 MHz broadcasts ended in 1953.

A binary-coded decimal time code began testing in 1960, and became permanent in 1961. This &quot;NASA time code&quot; was modulated onto a  kHz audio tone at 100 Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated &quot;baaga-bong&quot;. The code was also described as sounding like a &quot;buzz-saw&quot;. On July 1, 1971, the time code&#x27;s broadcast was changed to 100 Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder).

WWV moved to a location near Fort Collins on December 1, 1966, enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States. WWVB had signed on in that location three years earlier. In April 1967, WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site (Eastern Time until 1966, and Mountain Time afterwards) and switched to broadcasting Greenwich Mean Time or GMT. The station switched again, to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), in 1974.

The 20 and 25 MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977, but the 20 MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year. Starting on April 4, 2014, the 25 MHz signal was back on the air in an &#x27;experimental&#x27; mode.

The voice used on WWV was that of professional broadcaster Don Elliott Heald until August 13, 1991, when equipment changes required re-recording the voice of another professional broadcaster, John Doyle, but was soon switched to the voice of KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers. Since then John Doyle&#x27;s voice has been returned to the broadcast.

WWV, along with WWVB and WWVH, was recommended for defunding and elimination in NIST&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2019 budget request. However, the final 2019 NIST budget preserved funding for the three stations.

===WWV and Sputnik===
WWV&#x27;s 20 MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the disintegration of Russian satellite Sputnik 1 after the craft&#x27;s onboard electronics failed. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV&#x27;s signal was noticeably strengthened for a duration lasting over a minute. The strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik&#x27;s last orbits. Using this information, Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik&#x27;s disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.

==Broadcast format==

On top of the standard carrier frequencies, WWV carries additional information using standard double-sideband amplitude modulation. WWV&#x27;s transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute. They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them. Because they are so similar, both are described here.

===Date and time===
WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows:
# English-language voice announcements of time.
# Binary-coded decimal time code of date and time, transmitted as varying length pulses of 100 Hz tone, one bit per second.

In both cases the transmitted time is given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

===Per-second ticks and minute markers===

WWV transmits audio &quot;ticks&quot; once per second, to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization. These ticks are always transmitted, even during voice announcements and silent periods. Each tick begins on the second, lasts 5 ms and consists of 5 cycles of a  Hz sine wave. To make the tick stand out more, all other signals are suppressed for 40 ms, from 10 ms before the second until 30 ms after (25 ms after the tick). As an exception, no tick (and no silent interval) is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute. In the event of a leap second, no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute, either.

On the minute, the tick is extended to a 0.8 second long beep, followed by 0.2 s of silence. On the hour, this minute pulse is transmitted at  Hz rather than  Hz. The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute.

Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute, the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling some of the once-per-second ticks, transmitting a second tick 100 ms after the first. (The second tick preempts other transmissions, but does not get a silent zone.) The absolute value of this difference, in tenths of a second, is determined by the number of doubled ticks. The sign is determined by the position; if the doubled ticks begin at second one, UT1 is ahead of UTC; if they begin at second nine, UT1 is behind UTC.

WWVH transmits similar 5 ms ticks, but they are sent as 6 cycles of  Hz. The minute beep is also  Hz, except on the hour, when it is  Hz.

The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100% modulation (−3 dBc for both sidebands).

===Voice time announcements===
Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute, giving the time of the following minute beep. The format for the voice announcement is, &quot;At the tone, X hour(s), Y minute(s), Coordinated Universal Time.&quot; 
The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7.5 seconds before the minute tone.

WWVH makes an identical time announcement, starting 15 seconds before the minute tone, in a female voice.

When voice announcements were first instituted, they were phrased as: &quot;National Bureau of Standards, WWV; when the tone returns, Eastern Standard Time is [time in 12-hour format, e.g. four ten p.m.]&quot; followed by 4-digit GMT sent in Morse code. After the 1967 switch to GMT, the announcement changed to &quot;National Bureau of Standards, WWV, Fort Collins, Colorado; next tone begins at X hours, Y minute(s), Greenwich Mean Time.&quot; However, this format would be short-lived. The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971. &quot;At the tone, X hour(s), Y minute(s), Greenwich Mean Time.&quot; The name &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; was changed to &quot;Coordinated Universal Time&quot; in 1974.

Voice time announcements are sent at 75% modulation (−1.25 dBc), &quot;i.e.&quot;, the carrier varies between 25% and 175% of nominal power.

===Other voice announcements===
WWV transmits 44-second official announcements from various government departments (in lieu of the standard frequency tones) on an hourly schedule: 
* A station identification at :00 and :30 past each hour;
* At :04 past the hour (:03 for WWVH), NIST broadcasts any announcements regarding a manual change in the operation of WWV and WWVH, such as leap second announcements. , NIST is currently broadcasting a description of the experimental signal being sent at :08.
* At :08 past the hour (:48 for WWVH), some special atmospheric propagation test signals are broadcast, consisting of &quot;several seconds each of Gaussian white noise, chirps varying up and down in frequency, and tones varying in amplitude, frequency and length.&quot; This signal began on 15 November 2021.
* At :18 past, a special &quot;geophysical alert&quot; report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is transmitted, containing information on solar activity and shortwave radio propagation conditions. Here is an example of this announcement from May 24, 2018 at 0905 UTC:
* At :47 and :52, WWVH (only) broadcasts an announcement about the telephone time service.

Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone, but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary:
* At :10 past the hour WWV transmits a Department of Defense message if any exists; WWVH does the same at :50 past the hour.
* :16 minutes past the hour is used for additional NIST announcements, if necessary.

WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule. WWV and WWVH&#x27;s voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk; WWV airs dead air when WWVH airs voice announcements, and vice versa.

Announcements formerly carried by WWV, but now discontinued, include:
* Marine storm warnings, provided by the National Weather Service, for the Atlantic Ocean at :08 and :09 minutes past the hour, for the Pacific Ocean at :10 past, with :11 past available for additional warnings if necessary. WWVH&#x27;s storm warnings were broadcast from :48 to :51, and covered the area around the Hawaiian islands and the Far East rather than North America. WWV and WWVH discontinued all weather content on February 7, 2019, and the time slots they previously occupied are now classified as &quot;NIST Reserved.&quot;
* At :14 and :15 past, GPS satellite health reports from the Coast Guard Navigation Center (:43 and :44 for WWVH).
* Prior to the shutdown of the OMEGA navigation system in 1997, an OMEGA status report was broadcast at :16 past the hour.
* There was a proposal to discontinue the geophysical alerts on September 6, 2011. However, as of June 17, 2011, WWV announced that the decision has been retracted and that the geophysical alert reports &quot;will continue for the foreseeable future&quot;.

====Half-hourly station identification announcement====

WWV identifies itself twice each hour, at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour. The text of the identification is as follows:

WWV accepts reception reports sent to the address mentioned in the station ID, and responds with QSL cards.

===Standard audio tone frequencies===
WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tones during most minutes. They begin after the 1-second minute mark and continue until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute.

Even-numbered minutes (except for minute 2) transmit 500 Hz, while 600 Hz is heard during odd-numbered minutes. The tone is interrupted for 40 ms each second by the second ticks. WWVH is similar, but exchanges the two tones. This makes it easier to distinguish the two stations; the two tones are in opposite arrangement between each station over 10 milliseconds.

WWV also transmits a 440 Hz tone, a pitch commonly used in music (A440, the musical note A above middle C) during minute 2 of each hour, except for the first hour of the UTC day. Since the 440 Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour, many chart recorders may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day, and likewise, the omission of the 440 Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty-four-hour period. WWVH transmits the same tone during minute 1 of each hour.

No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH; the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes 43 through 51 (inclusive) and minutes 29 and 59 of each hour. Likewise, WWVH transmits no tone during minutes 0, 8, 9, 10, 14 through 19, and 30.

Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50% modulation (−3 dBc).
===Digital time code===
Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital time code, interpretable by radio-controlled clocks. The time code uses a 100 Hz subcarrier of the main signal. That is, it is an additional low-level 100 Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals.

This code is similar to, and has the same framework as, the IRIG H time code and the time code that WWVB transmits, except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first. Like the IRIG timecode, the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute. Also like the IRIG timecode, numeric data (minute, hour, day of year, and last two digits of year) are sent in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format rather than as simple binary integers: Each decimal digit is sent as two, three, or four bits (depending on its possible range of values).

==== Bit encoding ====
The 100 Hz subcarrier is transmitted at −15 dBc (18% modulation) beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second (the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick), and then reduced by 15 dB (to −30 dBc, 3% modulation) at one of three times within the second. The duration of the high amplitude 100 Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0, a data bit of 1, or a &quot;marker&quot;, as follows:

* If the subcarrier is reduced 800 ms past the second, this indicates a &quot;marker.&quot;
* If the subcarrier is reduced 500 ms past the second, this indicates a data bit with value one.
* If the subcarrier is reduced 200 ms past the second, this indicates a data bit with value zero.

A single bit or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first (second :00). The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker, previously described.

In the diagram above, the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100 Hz subcarrier, with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier (−15 dB referenced to 100% modulation) and red the lower strength subcarrier (−30 dB referenced to 100% modulation). The widest yellow bars represent the markers, the narrowest represent data bits with value 0, and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value 1.

==== Interpretation ====
It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code. Most of the bits encode UTC time, day of year, year of century, and UT1 correction up to ±0.7 s.

Like the WWVB time code, only the tens and units digits of the year are transmitted; unlike the WWVB time code, there is no direct indication for leap year. Thus, receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year (correct for year 2000) will be incorrect in the year 2100. On the other hand, receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through 2399.

The table below shows the interpretation of each bit, with the &quot;Ex&quot; column being the values from the example above.

The example shown encodes day 86 (March 27) of 2009, at 21:30:00 UTC. DUT1 is +0.3, so UT1 is 21:30:00.3. Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00:00 UTC (DST1=0), and will not be in effect at the next 00:00 UTC (DST2=0). There is no leap second scheduled (LSW=0). The day of year normally runs from 1 (January 1) through 365 (December 31), but in leap years, December 31 would be day 366, and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27.

====Daylight saving time and leap seconds====
The time code contains three bits announcing daylight saving time (DST) changes and imminent leap seconds.

* Bit :03 is set near the beginning of the month which is scheduled to end in a leap second. It is cleared when the leap second occurs.
* Bit :55 (DST2) is set at UTC midnight just before DST comes into effect. It is cleared at UTC midnight just before standard time resumes.
* Bit :02 (DST1) is set at UTC midnight just after DST comes into effect, and cleared at UTC midnight just after standard time resumes.

If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ, DST is changing during the current UTC day, at the next 02:00 local time. Before the next 02:00 local time after that, the bits will be the same. Each change in the DST bits happens at 00:00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16:00 (PST) and 20:00 (EDT), depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end. A receiver in the Eastern time zone (UTC−5) must therefore correctly receive the &quot;DST is changing&quot; indication within the seven hours before DST begins, and six hours before DST ends, if it is to change the local time display at the correct time. Receivers in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones have one, two, and three more hours of advance notice, respectively.

During a leap second, a binary zero is transmitted in the time code; in this case, the minute will not be preceded by a marker.

<text>This is a list of countries by rail usage. Usage of rail transport may be measured in tonne-kilometres (tkm) or passenger-kilometres (pkm) travelled for freight and passenger transport respectively. This is the number of tonnes or passengers multiplied by the average distance of their journeys in kilometres.

== Overview ==
Globally, rail freight is transported to the extent of almost 10,000 billion tonne-kilometres (9.842 billion long ton-miles or 11.023 billion short ton-miles) per year, of which about one-third occurs in India and a quarter each in the United States and China.

Of the 3,000 bn passenger-kilometres travelled across the world each year, 1,346 bn are travelled in China and 1,150 bn in India. Thus China and India together contribute almost half of world&#x27;s passenger travel.

The average Swiss person travels 2,430 km by train each year (the highest in the world), almost 500 more than the average Japanese person (the second highest).

In 2014, there were about 1 million kilometres (621,400 miles) of railway in the world, a decrease of 3% compared to 2013.
* 350,000 km (218,000 mi) were in Europe and mainly used for passenger service.
* 370,000 km (230,000 mi) were in North America and mainly used for freight.
* 230,000 km (140,000 mi) were in Asia and used for both freight and passenger service.

In America and Europe, many low-fare airlines and motorways compete with rail for passenger traffic. Asia has experienced a large growth in high-speed rail: its 257bn passenger-kilometres represent 72% of total world high-speed rail passenger traffic.

== Passenger rail ==
These figures do not include metro railway systems; see &quot;Lists of rapid transit systems&quot; for metro rail statistics.

=== Passenger-kilometres of rail transport per year ===

&quot;Countries with more than five billion passenger-kilometres (pkm) travelled per year. Unless otherwise specified, data come from the Railway Statistics 2015 Report by the International Union of Railways (UIC).&quot;

=== Passengers carried in rail transport per year ===
&quot;Countries with more than 20 million passengers per year. Unless otherwise specified, data come from the Railway Statistics 2019 Report by the International Union of Railways.&quot;

As mentioned in the notes, many of these figures are very incomplete, as they exclude metro/rapid transport rail services.
=== Passenger modal share for rail ===
The modal share of railway transport (excluding tram &amp; metro) as compared to other modes of transport, based on Passenger-km.

=== Passenger rail by passenger-kilometres per capita ===

&quot;Countries with more than five billion passenger-kilometres travelled per year.&quot;

== Freight rail ==
=== Tonne-kilometres of rail transport per year ===
&quot;Countries with more than one billion tonne-kilometres (tkm) travelled per year. Unless otherwise specified, data come from the Railway Statistics 2014 Report by the International Union of Railways.&quot;

=== Tonnes carried in rail transport per year ===
&quot;Countries with more than ten million tonnes carried per year. Unless otherwise specified, data come from the Railway Statistics 2014 Report by the International Union of Railways.&quot;
=== Freight modal share for rail ===
The modal share carried by rail of all freight in a given country.
=== Freight rail by tonne-kilometres per capita ===

<text>WWVH is the callsign of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s shortwave radio time signal station located at the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands, in Kekaha, on the island of Kauai in the state of Hawaii. 

WWVH is the Pacific sister station to WWV, and has a similar broadcast format. Like WWV, WWVH&#x27;s main function is the dissemination of the official U.S. Government time and frequency standard.

Due to ionospheric conditions, at certain times and locations some listeners may receive both WWV and WWVH on the same frequency at the same time. The information modulated on the carrier is modified to reduce confusion if both are received simultaneously. In particular, voice announcements on one correspond to silent periods on the other. WWVH uses a female voice (Jane Barbe) to distinguish itself from WWV, which uses a male voice.

WWVH time signals can also be accessed by telephone at +1 (808) 335-4363.

== Transmission system ==


WWVH broadcasts its signal on four transmitters, one for each frequency. The 2.5 MHz transmitter puts out 5 kW, while the other transmitters provide 10 kW. The 2.5 MHz antenna is one quarter-wavelength tall, and radiates in an omnidirectional pattern. The 10 and 15 MHz antennas are omnidirectional half-wave antennas. The 5 MHz antenna consists of two elements one half-wavelength tall and horizontally separated by one quarter-wavelength. This phased-array directional antenna produces a broad cardioid radiation pattern with a maximum gain directed west.

Emergency stand-by transmitters and antennas are provided for each frequency.
== Broadcast format ==


The WWVH signal is extremely similar to the WWV signal, but some changes have been made to reduce confusion if both are heard at once:
* The 5 ms second ticks are 6 cycles of rather than 5 cycles of 1,000 Hz. The 800 ms minute beep is also 1,200 Hz. (Like WWV, this is omitted during minutes 29 and 59, and changed to 1,500 Hz at the top of each hour.)
* The voice announcements use a female voice (that of Jane Barbe) and last 7.5 seconds starting 15 seconds before the minute. (WWV broadcasts in a male voice during the last 7.5 seconds of each minute.)
* The audio tones sent during the first 45 seconds of most minutes are swapped: is played during even minutes, and is played during odd minutes. (Receiving both simultaneously gives the listener a sound similar to a continuously ringing chime.)
* The A440 tone marking the hour is sent during minute 1 (as opposed to minute 2 for WWV). Like WWV, it is omitted during the first hour of each UTC day.
* The audio tones are suppressed while WWV is transmitting voice announcements: minutes 00, 08–10, 14–19, and 30.
* The voice announcements are rescheduled relative to WWV:
** Station identification is made during minutes 29 and 59 (vs. 00 and 30)
** GPS satellite health reports are transmitted during minutes 43 and 44 (vs. 14 and 15)
** NOAA space weather geoalerts are transmitted during minute 45 (vs. 18)
** National Weather Service storm warnings for all sections of the Pacific Ocean are broadcast during minutes 48–51, overflowing to minute 52 when necessary (vs. Atlantic and northeast Pacific information during 08–10 and 11).
** Minutes 03 and 47 are used for NIST special announcements when necessary (vs. 04 and 16). Like WWV, prior to the OMEGA Navigation System shutdown in 1997, the OMEGA status report was broadcast at :47 past the hour.

== Half-hourly station identification announcement ==
WWVH identifies itself twice each hour, at 29 and 59 minutes past the hour. The text of the identification is as follows:
Reception reports sent to that address will on request be answered with a QSL card.

== Telephone service ==
WWVH&#x27;s time signal can also be accessed by calling +1 (808) 335-4363.

<doc id="325627" wikidata="Q1584311" url="?curid=325627" title="Malinalco">
<text>Malinalco () is the municipality inside of Ixtapan Region, is a town and municipality located 65 kilometers south of the city of Toluca in the south of the western portion of the State of Mexico. Malinalco is southwest of Mexico City.

Malinalco has always been associated with magic or sorcery due to the legend that it was the home the goddess Malinalxóchitl. The municipality is home to the famed village of Chalma, where according to legend, an image of a Black Christ miraculously appeared in a cave that was devoted to the god Oxtoteotl. It is the second-most visited shrine in Mexico, after the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

The Aztecs conquered the area in the 1470s, and established a sanctuary for their military elite, the Eagle and Jaguar warriors. The complex was built on the Cerro de los Idolos (Hill of the Idols), over an older ceremonial site. The main attraction of this archeological site is the Cuauhcalli or House of Eagles, which is a building carved out of the side of the mountain.

The name Malinalco comes from the Nahuatl word &quot;malinalli&quot;, which is a kind of grass (Poaceae) called &quot;zacate del carbonero&quot; in Spanish, the word &quot;xóchitl&quot;, which means flower and &quot;co&quot;, which means place, which a translation of “where they worship the goddess Malinalxóchitl, the malinalli flower”. The name also refers to one of the time periods on the Aztec calendar, marked by the malinalli plant, according to the Quauhtinchan Annals. In Aztec and early colonial times, the area was represented by a number of glyphs, often with elements of the malinalli plant and/or a human skull to indicate sacrifice.

Unlike most other municipalities in the state of Mexico, Malinalco does not use an Aztec glyph or coat of arms. Instead, it has a logo that was designed by Ernesto Romero Tetazin in 1985. It consists of the seal of the nation of Mexico, from which rises a figure that simulates a low mountain under a malinalli flower. This includes the motto “Your archeology is the perseverance of our race, culture and work” (&quot;Tu arqueología constancia de nuestra raza cultura y trabajo&quot;). To the left is the word Malinaltepetl.

==Geography==
As municipal seat, the town of Malinalco is the governing authority over 54 other named communities, which covers an area of 186.28km2. The municipality, which shares its name with the seat, has a population of 22,970 of which only 6,523 live in the town of Malinalco. It has an average elevation of 1750 meters above sea level and is bordered by the municipalities of Joquicingo, Ocuilan, Zumpahuacán, Tenancingo and the state of Morelos. Malinalco is wedged between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Norte of the state of Morelos, Elevations are higher in the north with the highest being the Cerro de la Loma at approximating 2700 meters above sea level. The major river is the Chalma River, also called the Ocuilan River. Another river is the Colapa, which flows into the Chalma. There are also a number of fresh-water springs such as the San Miguel, Ateopa and Cuatzonco, most of which are the source of potable water for the communities of the municipality. The climate is warm but not hot with rains mostly in the summer. The landscape is bright green in the summer and a golden color in the winter. Average temperatures vary between 20C in the higher elevations to 35C in the lower ones. The higher elevations mostly have mixed pine forests, with more tropical vegetation in the lowlands. Wildlife includes deer, various small mammals, a number of reptile species and birds.

The San Miguel River is part of the Chalma-Malinalco sub-basin. It is an intermittent river and crosses the entire municipality, including the town itself. It has been used to dump trash so that the river produces disease, fetid odors and environmental damage. This has discouraged tourism to the town, and prevented the town from becoming a “Pueblo Mágico.” Plans to rescue the river include reforestation around the river’s source, improving drainage systems in Malinalco and other communities, eliminating liquid discharges into the river and better solid waste management in the municipality. A recycling facility has been built in Malinalco, in order to better handle the waste generated, sending less to the landfill.

===Biodiversity===
Malinalco has some of the widest biodiversity in Mexico. Its tropical deciduous, pine, and gallery forests accommodate a huge variety of flora and fauna. Dozens of mammals such as civet, armadillos, foxes, coyotes, squirrels and deer are common. Jaguars may live in the region, according to the UAEMEX. There are also many species of insects, crustaceans, birds, and edible mushrooms. There are very few dangerous animals, such as coral snakes, rattlesnakes, and scorpions. There are a number of myths that have demonized some animals like the scorpion vinagrillo or nana, the salamanquesca, a blue-tailed lizard, the Matip night and many others. The Living Museum &quot;The Malinalco Bugs&quot; and the turtle camp Mali-Xanat display some of the local species. 

==History==
According to mythology, the god Huitzilopochtli abandoned his sister Malinalxóchitl because she was practicing evil witchcraft. While she slept, he left her in the middle of the forest. When she woke, she was furious at having been abandoned by her brother. She gathered people loyal to her and marched off to settle in what is now Malinalco. Another version of the story has Malinalxóchitl as the leader of a dissident Mexica tribe, who left to settle in what is now Malinalco and intermarried with the people already there.
Since far in the pre-Hispanic past, Malinalco was considered a magical place, filled with gods and sorcerers. The area shows influences from the Teotihuacan culture, the Toltecs, Matlatzincas and Aztecs, but little is known of the area’s pre-Aztec history. Remains of an earlier ceremonial center exist at the summit of the Cerro de los Idolos (Hill of the Idols), but this center and its associated residential zones have not been excavated. The first settlements in this part of Mexico State date back to the early post-Classic and the beginning of the late post-Classic. This was a time when many populations were on the move in the highlands of Mexico, with new peoples moving south from what is now northern Mexico. The first people to arrive were probably the Culhuas, led by a chief named Cuauhtepexpetlatzin, after this group had already settled in the Valley of Mexico. Other peoples to arrive include the Matlazincas, the Ocuiltecos and the Otomi. By the time the Aztecs arrived, the area was dominated by the Matlazincas, who had settled earlier in the Toluca Valley by 8th century CE, then migrated. By the mid-15th century, the Aztecs and the Matlazincas had something of an understanding. However, in 1476, the Aztecs subjected this area to their empire under the rule of Axayacatl. While Axayacatl conquered this area, it was a successor, Ahuizotl who had most of the Aztec shrines, temples and other constructions built. including the fort and sanctuary for Aztec military elite. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of Malinalco resisted the conquistadors. Andrés de Tapia was in charge of subduing the populations of Malinalco and Ocuilán. Once this was achieved, the area was organized into encomiendas. Malinalco was first under the jurisdiction of Cristobál Rodriguez de Avalos and then the Spanish Crown itself.

The Franciscans were the first to arrive and begin the evangelization process, followed by the Dominicans. However, it was the Augustinians who stayed and built the monastery from which evangelization would center. This monastery was originally called San Cristobál but later the named was changed to Divino Salvador. After the construction of the Temple of the Divino Salvador, neighborhood chapels were constructed in the various parts of town. It is likely that these chapels started out as simple thatched roof structures. During the colonial period, a communal water supply system was developed, taking advantage of the natural water flows in the box canyon that surrounds the town. The Jalmolonga Hacienda was one of the economic focuses of the area, which was part of the Rodriguez encomienda. Later, when the Jesuits came, they took over this hacienda, which was productive enough to support many of the expenses of the San Pedro and San Pablo College located in Mexico City. When the Jesuits were expelled in the 18th century, this land was eventually sold to the Count of Regla, Manuel Romero de Terreros.

During the Mexican War of Independence, José María Morelos y Pavon passed through in 1813, signing a document acknowledging the local indigenous laws regarding agricultural practices, and demanding the withdrawal of an ecclesiastical request to send money to Spain to fight the French. While Benito Juárez and the liberals won the Reform War in 1861 against the conservatives, conservatives in the Malinalco area continued to fight for a while from the mountains. When the Reform Laws were applied against the Monastery of the Divino Salvador, it continued to operate as a monastery for a while, although the state owned the land and buildings.

Due to its proximity to the state of Morelos, Malinalco was Zapatista territory during most of the Mexican Revolution. Malinalco put itself under the command of General Genovevo de la O starting in 1911. By 1913, Zapatistas and troops loyal to Venustiano Carranza both claimed this area. During the regime of Victoriano Huerta, Malinalco stayed loyal to the Zapatistas, despite government efforts to eradicate the rebels.

=== Populated places in Malinalco ===
===The town===
Malinalco is set in a semi-enclosed valley, surrounded by cliffs. The houses are mostly made of adobe with red tile roofs, some of which are painted bright colors. Almost all the houses from the finest to the most humble have fruit trees in their yards, The streets are paved in cobblestones and on these donkeys can still be found hauling firewood and other burdens. Breads are often still baked in clay ovens that are heated with wood, and homemade pulque is often sold by street vendors. Malinalco&#x27;s traditional culinary specialty is trout. This dish became popular with the many pilgrims who stayed while visiting the nearby shrine of Chalma. Many restaurants and street stands serve the fish in a variety of ways: wrapped in paper and steamed, fried, highly spiced or &quot;a la diabla&quot; and covered in garlic butter. Other well-known dishes include iguana, stewed rabbit and tamales make with frog and ajolote meat. The south of the municipality produces mezcal, while the north produces pulque. The center of town has numerous vendors selling lime, sapote, mamey and soursop sherbets. Two km to the south of the city center is the El Molino trout farm, where you can choose your fish and have it prepared to order. Between the town of Malinalco and Chalma is another large trout farm and may be the only one in the world where trout are raised in cold mountains water under banana trees. A traditional drink to have with the meal is pineapple juice prepared with tequila, vodka or mezcal. Market day is Wednesday, when vendors come into town from the outlying villages to sell. This market sells regional produce, traditional food and wood crafted in different forms such as animals and musical instruments. Malinalco was named a Pueblo con Encanto (Town with Charm) by the state of Mexico.

At la Casa Mia, handcrafts, particularly alebrijes are for sale.

Tecorrales

Malinalco is characterized by a number of unique architectural elements that are in response to its being located in a tight canyon. Chief amongst them are the many dry stack stone walls that are located throughout the town. Known as &quot;tecorrales&quot;, these walls are widely recognized as a part of the history of Malinalco dating back to its prehispanic origins. The walls function in many ways that are beneficial, including erosion control and creating habitat for flora and fauna. The word &quot;tecorral&quot; is a portmanteau combing the Spanish word &quot;corral&quot; with the Nahuatl word &quot;te&quot;. The prefix &quot;te&quot; conveys a range of ideas including place as well as evoking an essence, related to the word &quot;teotl&quot;. It is this latter word conveying the sacred embodiment of place that makes the tecorrales in Malinalco so important to appreciating the long history of the region and its connection to Malinalxóchitl.

While the design and architecture of Malinalco continues to employ many distinctive vernacular walls including adobe and rocks, the historical presence of the original tecorrals give the city a distinctive quality. Unfortunately, due to natural erosion as well as changing attitudes about their significance, the remaining tecorrales are under threat and need better protection. 

An important example of how the tecorrales remain an important aspect of local culture is the arts and community center El Tecorral that hosts diverse classes for both children and adults as well as a popular green market on Saturdays. Under the auspices of El Tecorral Los Angeles based artist Nick Herman along with local artist Bernardo Orihuela have begun the process of mapping the remaining tecorrales as a first step in their protection. It is hoped this becomes an ongoing project that links families within the pueblo to their important historical home.

==Economy==
Despite being in one of Mexico’s most populated regions, the municipality is still quite rural as it is located in an isolated valley, with farmland on the valley floor, and forests in the elevations. Most of the land in the municipality is used for forestry, followed by fish farming then agriculture. However, agriculture is the most important economic activity, harvesting corn, flowers and rice. There is some livestock but very little industry. Trout farming is also an important economic activity. Commerce centers on the needs of the local population and tourism in the case of the towns of Malinalco and Chalma. Sixty-three percent of the population makes its living through agriculture, livestock and trout-farming. A study done on peasant households in the municipality show that these families depend on multiple economic activities, including temporary migration to nearby cities or the United States.
 
The best-known community outside of the municipal seat is Chalma, which is famous for being the sanctuary of the Lord of Chalma, an apparition of a crucified black Christ. Its small population is almost entirely dedicated to meeting the needs of pilgrims who come throughout the year. According to legend, the Christ figure miraculously appeared at a cave where the pre-Hispanic local people used to worship a deity named Oxtoteotl. Pilgrimages to this Christian sanctuary follow many of the patterns of the old pagan rituals, including walking the narrow paths to the town itself, bathing in the waters of a special fresh-water spring and dancing at the sanctuary. Between Malinalco and Chalma there are large boulders, which according to legend, are people who have been turned to stone because they disobeyed this god. Near Chalma, because of the sanctuary, many famous people have bought ranches and other property. These include Verónica Castro, Daniela Romo, ex regent of Mexico City Oscar Espinoza Villareal and many politicians from Mexico State.

In addition to the Cerro de los Idolos, there are 35 archeological sites in the municipality including those found in Matlalac, Rincon de Techimalco, Rincon de San Miguel, Cerro Orquemil, Rincon del Pozo and others. These also include sites that contain cave paintings and petroglyphs, some of which are at least 2,000 years old. One of the best-known of these sites is Las Caritas, east of town on the other side of the highway. Here small faces are carved to the cave&#x27;s rockface. Two other sites that contain small cave paintings are Los Diablitos and El Coyotito Rojo, both to the north of Malinalco proper.

== Communication and transport ==
The state ways cross by Malinalco, the first connect with Chalma to Tenango del Valle, the second connect Malinalco with Tenancingo. There is other municipal ways, connect Chalma with Miacatlán, in the state of Morelos. In Chalma there is a Bus terminal with connections to Mexico City, Toluca and Cuernavaca.

=== Monuments ===
*Sanctuary of the Lord of Chalma consists of the church, the 17th century ex-monastery, caves and lodgings on the ridges around the town. The lodgings are primarily used during feast days when the area is packed with pilgrims. A stucco gate marks the entrance to the sacred precinct. Here is a concrete plaza in front of the church where mariachi players wait for requests and pilgrims on their knees can be seen. The facade and the interior of the sanctuary church are of Neoclassic design as a result of the last round of modifications. The inscription on the portal of the church reads &quot;Venid a mi todos los que estáis trabajados y cansados y yo os aliviaré&quot; (Come to me all you who are working and tired and I will give you rest). The church is filled with a number of paintings and sculptures with religious themes, most done in the 18th century, but the three main attractions are the image of the Christ of Chalma image itself, a sculpture of the Archangel Michel and a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe.(1408mexdes) Other notable paintings include scenes from the lives of Saint Augustine and Saint Nicolas Tolentino and one of the Passion of Christ. The image of the Christ of Chalma inside the church contains silver offerings placed in 1534 by silversmith Agustin Villaseñor.
*The major attraction is the Cuauhtinchan Archeological Zone, located just west of the town center on a hill called Cerro de los Idolos, which rises 215 meters above the town. On its sides are a number of pre-Hispanic structures built on terraces built into the hill. The main structures are at the top. This is one of the most important Aztec sites and was discovered in 1933, and explored by José Garía Payón in 1935. The visible complex dates from the Aztec Empire but the site’s use as a ceremonial center appears to be much older. The sanctuary complex was built from the mid 15th century to the beginnings of the 16th. To get to the Cerro de los Idolos one must climb 426 stairs up 125 meters. Along the stairway leading to the site, there are signs with area’s history written in Spanish, English and Nahuatl. The site contains six buildings. The Cuauhcalli or House of the Eagles, which dates from 1501, is the main building, which is significant in that it is carved out of the hill itself. The building is in the shape of a truncated pyramid, built this way due to the lack of space on the hill. The monolithic Cuauhcalli has been compared to the Ellora in India, Petra on the shores of the Dead Sea and Abu Simbel in Egypt. This was a sanctuary for the Eagle Warriors for rites such as initiation. A thirteen-step staircase leading into this temple is flanked by side struts. and two feline sculptures that face the plaza in front. The Cuauhcalli consists of two rooms, one rectangular and the other circular, with an opening in the wall between the two. After being carved out of the rock, the walls and ceiling were covered in stucco and painted with murals, most of which are almost completely gone. In the upper part, the entrance is symbolized by the open jaws of a serpent, complete with fangs, eyes and a forked tongue, which was painted red. This upper portion is covered by a thatched roof of the grass the area is named for.

*The Temple and ex-monastery of the Divino Salvador was built between 1540 and 1560. This was an Augustine monastery, which was built to be the center of evangelization work in this area. It is located in the center of town and has a medieval look, with thick, coarse walls. The decoration is sober with square columns. The facade of the temple is a simple Plateresque and is quite high for a rural church. The Plateresque elements include angels, rose windows and the conch shell friezes. The interior of the monastery is covered in murals, which are the original from the 16th century, and is one of the earliest examples of mestizo art, done by indigenous artists. On the first level of the monastery, the murals depict the Garden of Eden story in an Aztec codex style. The atrium of the monastery maintains its original dimensions, and the courtyard is filled with medicinal and alimentary plants. Animals such as monkeys, iguanas and opossums can be found as well. From the courtyard lead remnants of the paths that led to processional chapels. At the south of the property, there are seven arches. Some experts claim this was an open air chapel but others state they were simply entrance arches. Local legend links these arches to the first seven Augustine friars to arrive to New Spain.


*The Doctor Luis Mario Schneider University Museum is named after an Argentine humanist and literary who was enamored by Malinalco, living there for 30 years. He founded the museum, although it is the property of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México. It contains seven halls dealing with the geography, mythology and history of Malinalco and temporary exhibitions. The permanent collection is divided into exhibitions on festivals, the rainy season, the geological strata of the area, the underworld, the dry season and the House of the Eagle Warriors. The last is a reproduction of the main building of the Cerro de los Idolos, which is closed to visitors. The garden is a replica of that of the Cuauhcalli, which is also not open to visitors. The university opened a Department of Philology specializing in the history and criticism of Latin American literature. The department has a collection of 17,000 books, 3,000 magazines and 250 cases of documents for research and will have both graduate and undergraduate degree programs.
*The Casa de Cultura or Cultural Center is located in the center of town in front of the Municipal Palace. It is decorated with replicas of the murals found at the archeological zone and old photographs of native cultures. It also hosts dances, expositions and other cultural events.
*The Tlakuikani Gallery hosts expositions of contemporary arts done by artists from Malinalco and other parts of the State of Mexico. This gallery is located in the Barrio de Santa Maria Norte and specializes in the exposition and sale of oil paintings and wood carvings.

Outside of the center of town, there are many small neighborhoods, each having its own chapel. Most of these chapels were built between the 16th and the 17th centuries and many of these, such as those of Santa Maria, San Martin, San Guillermo, San Pedro, San Andres and La Soledad are considered to be works of art. For example, the chapel of San Juan has reliefs of Augustinian monks and the head of the encomendero of Malinalco, Cristobàl Romero. All of the chapels in the town face west with the exception of the Chapel of Santa Mónica. This one is dedicated to the mother of the founder of the order and faces the convent. Each one is unique in some way, and each has its own feast day. Most of these are located south of the town center following Benito Juarez Street out of town. Chapels include those of Santa María, San Martín, San Guillermo, San Pedro, San Andrés and the Virgin of Soledad. One to the north is the Chapel of San Juan, which has reliefs of Augustine friar Cristobal Romero. To the west is the Chapel of Santa Mónica, which has been quite altered in the last two centuries.

==Sports and entertainment==
The first sport practiced in Malinalco was football. The town has a second division club named &quot;Colibríes de Malinalco&quot;. Swimming and basketball facilities are also available. 

The hills of Malinalco are grazed by cows and sheep; the Spanish had very large &quot;haciendas&quot; and found it necessary to employ indigenous people as &quot;vaqueros&quot; or herdsman, who soon became experienced horsemen. 

The area is popular with tourists, with several nightclubs and other venues popular on weekends.

== Notable people ==
*José Maria de Yermo y Parres, philosopher and Roman Catholic Saint, was born in Xalmolonga hacienda in Malinalco.

<text>Life on Earth: A Natural History by David Attenborough is a British television natural history series made by the BBC in association with Warner Bros. Television and Reiner Moritz Productions. It was transmitted in the UK from 16 January 1979.

During the course of the series presenter David Attenborough, following the format established by Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;Civilisation&quot; and Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (both series which he designed and produced as director of BBC2), travels the globe in order to trace the story of the evolution of life on the planet. Like the earlier series, it was divided into 13 programmes (each of around 55 minutes&#x27; duration). The executive producer was Christopher Parsons and the music was composed by Edward Williams.

At a cost exceeding £1 million ($1.2 million), it was an immense project that involved filming over 100 locations around the world and took three years in the making by a team of 30 people with the help of more than 500 scientists. Highly acclaimed as a milestone in the history of British wildlife television, it established Attenborough as not only the foremost television naturalist, but also an iconic figure in British cultural life. It is the first in Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; series of programmes and was followed by &quot;The Living Planet&quot; (1984).

==Filming techniques==
Several special filming techniques were devised to obtain some of the footage of rare and elusive animals. One cameraman spent hundreds of hours waiting for the fleeting moment when a Darwin&#x27;s frog, which incubates its young in its mouth, finally spat them out. Another built a replica of a mole rat burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the mole rat ran along the tunnel, the wheel could be spun to keep the animal adjacent to the camera. To illustrate the motion of bats&#x27; wings in flight, a slow-motion sequence was filmed in a wind tunnel. The series was also the first to include footage of a live (although dying) coelacanth.

The cameramen took advantage of improved film stock to produce some of the sharpest and most colourful wildlife footage that had been seen to date.

The programmes also pioneered a style of presentation whereby David Attenborough would begin describing a certain species&#x27; behaviour in one location, before cutting to another to complete his illustration. Continuity was maintained, despite such sequences being filmed several months and thousands of miles apart.

==Gorilla encounter==
The best remembered sequence occurs in the twelfth episode, when Attenborough encounters a group of mountain gorillas in Dian Fossey&#x27;s sanctuary in Rwanda. The primates had become used to humans through years of being studied by researchers. Attenborough originally intended merely to get close enough to narrate a piece about the apes&#x27; use of the opposable thumb, but as he advanced on all fours toward the area where they were feeding, he suddenly found himself face to face with an adult female. Discarding his scripted speech, he turned to camera and delivered a whispered ad lib:

When Attenborough returned to the site the next day, the female and two young gorillas began to groom and play with him. In his memoirs, Attenborough describes this as &quot;one of the most exciting encounters of my life&quot;. He subsequently discovered, to his chagrin, that only a few seconds had been recorded: the cameraman was running low on film and wanted to save it for the planned description of the opposable thumb.

In 1999 viewers of Channel 4 voting for the 100 Greatest TV Moments placed the gorilla sequence at number 12—ranking it ahead of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation and the wedding of Charles and Diana.

==Critical and commercial reception==
The series attracted a weighted average of 15 million viewers in the UK, an exceptionally high figure for a BBC documentary back in the late 1970s. It was also a major international success, being sold to over 100 territories and watched by an estimated audience of 500 million people worldwide. However, &quot;Life on Earth&quot; did not generate the same revenue for the BBC as later Attenborough series because the corporation signed away the American and European rights to their co-production partners, Warner Bros. and Reiner Moritz.

It was nominated for four BAFTA TV awards and won the Broadcasting Press Guild Award for Best Documentary Series. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Life on Earth&quot; was placed 32nd.

==Episodes==
==1997 revision==
A shortened series, using the footage and commentary from the original, was aired in 1997, edited down to three episodes: early life forms, plants, insects, and amphibians in the first; fish, birds and reptiles in the second; and mammals in the third.

==DVD, Blu-ray and book==
The series is available in the UK for Regions 2 and 4 as a four-disc DVD set (BBCDVD1233, released 1 September 2003) and as part of &quot;The Life Collection&quot;.
In 2012 the series was released as a four-disc Blu-ray set (released 12 November 2012).

A hardback book, &quot;Life on Earth&quot; by David Attenborough, was published in 1979 and became a worldwide bestseller. Its cover image of a Panamanian red-eyed tree frog, was taken by Attenborough himself, became an instantly recognisable emblem of the series. It is currently out of print.

A revised and updated edition of the book was published in 2018 to favourable reviews. Most if not all of the images in the 2018 edition are new, but the text remains substantially the same as the original.

==Music==
Edward Williams&#x27; avant-garde score matched the innovative production techniques of the television series. Williams used a traditional chamber music ensemble of (harp, flute, clarinet, strings and percussion) combined with electronic sounds. The pieces were crafted scene-by-scene to synchronise with and complement the imagery on screen: in one sequence examining the flight of birds, the instrumentation mirrors each new creature&#x27;s appearance. The sounds were processed through an early British synthesiser, the EMS VCS 3, to create its evocative sound.

The score was never intended to be released commercially, but Williams had 100 copies pressed as gifts for the musicians involved. One of these LPs found its way into the hands of Jonny Trunk, owner of independent label Trunk Records, who negotiated the licence from the BBC. The soundtrack was finally released on 2 November 2009.

<doc id="325636" wikidata="Q7527226" url="?curid=325636" title="Henry Willink">
<text>Sir Henry Urmston Willink, 1st Baronet, (7 March 1894 – 20 July 1973) was a British politician and public servant. A Conservative Member of Parliament from 1940, he became Minister of Health in 1943. During his time in power he was appointed Special Commissioner for those made homeless by the London Blitz and was involved with the production of the Beveridge Report.

The details of the report proposed a comprehensive free healthcare system, this led to the white paper &quot;A National Health Service&quot;, published in 1944, suggesting the creation of such a service, which did not include the nationalisation of hospitals. Such a policy was later implemented by the Labour Party through the creation of the National Health Service which differed from the proposals suggested by Willink. At the time he claimed the nationalisation of voluntary hospitals &quot;will destroy so much in this country that we value&quot;.

== Early life and wartime service ==
Willink was born in Liverpool. He was educated as a King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton College, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1912, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Before he could take his Cambridge degree, he volunteered for service in the Royal Field Artillery during the First World War. When aged only 22, Willink commanded a battery at the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Willink received the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre. Post-war, he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1920, was appointed to the rank of King&#x27;s Counsel in 1935 and became a Bencher in 1942.

== Political career ==

Willink was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North in a wartime by-election on 19 June 1940. There was only one other candidate, an independent, who received a very small vote. In 1940, he was appointed Special Commissioner for the homeless in London.

Willink was made a privy counsellor in 1943, the year he became Minister of Health, a role in which he served until the Conservatives lost the 1945 general election. Willink, with John Hawton, was responsible for the 1944 White Paper, following the Beveridge Report, called &quot;A National Health Service&quot;. It proposed the creation of a fully comprehensive, universal healthcare system, free of charge and available to all citizens irrespective of means.

When Labour came into office in 1945, it presented its own plan in preference to Willink&#x27;s, which it had supported. The principal difference was that Willink&#x27;s plan talked of a &quot;publicly organised&quot; rather than a &quot;publicly provided&quot; service, and Labour&#x27;s plan brought hospitals into full national ownership. Willink&#x27;s successor Nye Bevan, however, made concessions to General practitioners.

Willink kept his seat at the 1945 general election by just 607 votes over Labour&#x27;s Marion Billson. Turnout was low and there were rumours of sacks of servicemen&#x27;s votes left uncounted in the Town Hall basement. Labour&#x27;s David Rees-Williams - later Baron Ogmore - had taken the other Croydon seat.

Willink resigned from Parliament on 29 January 1948, and the subsequent by-election was won resoundingly by Conservative Fred Harris, with a majority of almost 12,000 votes, despite a ballot of high-profile candidates.

== Public service ==

In 1938 Willink stood as a Conservative in Ipswich to replace the incumbent MP John Ganzoni, but lost to Richard Stokes.

Willink continued to serve in public positions. In 1948, he was appointed Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, a post he held until 1966. From 1953 until 1955 he was also Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He chaired the steering committee leading to the formation of the Royal College of General Practitioners, starting in 1952. Willink later described his role as Chairman of that Steering Committee as &quot;one of the very best projects with which I have ever been involved in my life.&quot;

In 1957 Willink served as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Future Numbers of Medical Practitioners and Intakes of Medical Students. The committee concluded that too many doctors were being trained and proposed a 12% reduction. That was soon realised to be a misjudgement. From 1955 to 1971, he held the office of Dean of Arches, the senior ecclesiastical judge of England.

He was made a baronet, of Dingle Bank in the City of Liverpool, in 1957, and was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Melbourne in 1955. His papers are held at Churchill College, Cambridge.

<doc id="325637" wikidata="Q7632653" url="?curid=325637" title="Successor function">
<text>In mathematics, the successor function or successor operation sends a natural number to the next one. The successor function is denoted by &quot;S&quot;, so &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; +1. For example, &quot;S&quot;(1) = 2 and &quot;S&quot;(2) = 3. The successor function is one of the basic components used to build a primitive recursive function.

Successor operations are also known as zeration in the context of a zeroth hyperoperation: H0(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = 1 + &quot;b&quot;. In this context, the extension of zeration is addition, which is defined as repeated succession.

==Overview==
The successor function is part of the formal language used to state the Peano axioms, which formalise the structure of the natural numbers. In this formalisation, the successor function is a primitive operation on the natural numbers, in terms of which the standard natural numbers and addition are defined. For example, 1 is defined to be &quot;S&quot;(0), and addition on natural numbers is defined recursively by:

This can be used to compute the addition of any two natural numbers. For example, 5 + 2 = 5 + &quot;S&quot;(1) = &quot;S&quot;(5 + 1) = &quot;S&quot;(5 + &quot;S&quot;(0)) = &quot;S&quot;(&quot;S&quot;(5 + 0)) = &quot;S&quot;(&quot;S&quot;(5)) = &quot;S&quot;(6) = 7.

Several constructions of the natural numbers within set theory have been proposed. For example, John von Neumann constructs the number 0 as the empty set {}, and the successor of &quot;n&quot;, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), as the set &quot;n&quot; ∪ {&quot;n&quot;}. The axiom of infinity then guarantees the existence of a set that contains 0 and is closed with respect to &quot;S&quot;. The smallest such set is denoted by N, and its members are called natural numbers.

The successor function is the level-0 foundation of the infinite Grzegorczyk hierarchy of hyperoperations, used to build addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc. It was studied in 1986 in an investigation involving generalization of the pattern for hyperoperations.

It is also one of the primitive functions used in the characterization of computability by recursive functions.

<text>Amecameca is a municipality located in the eastern panhandle of Mexico State between Mexico City and the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is located on federal highway 115 which leads to Cuautla, which is called the Volcano Route (Ruta de los Volcanes).

Amecameca area is a popular resort destination for visitors from Mexico City, Puebla and Morelos, owing to its mountain scenery, food scene, and other attractions. However, when Popocatépetl is active, tourism here drops dramatically. The area receives many visitors during the annual Carnival/Festival del Señor del Sacromonte, which extends over the week containing Ash Wednesday and is considered to be one of the most important festivals in Mexico State.

The name Amecameca comes from Nahuatl. It has been interpreted to mean “place where the papers signal or mark,” or “paper used ceremoniously.”

==History==
Settled human habitation in this area began early mostly in dispersed small villages. The Chichimeca tribe called the Totolimpanecas arrived around 1268 and populated the areas now known as Itztlacozauhcan, Tlayllotlacan Amaquemecan. Later arrivals occupied areas known as Tzacualtitlan Tenanco Amaquemecan and Atlauhtlan Tzacualtitlan Amaquemecan. These groups had their own small dominions. In 1336, another dominion called Tlaylloltlacan Teohuacan was formed. All these communities were collectively known as the Amaquemecans. Religious practices in this area were mostly performed in urban temples and shrines located on mountaintops and caves. In 1465, the Aztecs conquered this area, along with the rest of the Valley of Chalco, replacing local leaders with military governors and transforming the area into a tributary province with neighboring Tlalmanalco as capital.

Hernán Cortés arrived here in 1519 and noted that the houses here were well built with about 20,000 inhabitants. In 1521, the leaders here were Quetzalmazatzin and his brother Tecuanxayacatzin due to the help they gave Cortés in conquering Tenochtitlan. Soon thereafter, they were poisoned. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Franciscans were in charge of evangelizing the area. In 1525, Martín de Valencia set fire to the local priests&#x27; houses on the Amaqueme Mountain (Sacromonte), and in 1527 construction of the Franciscan monastery began. The cult to the Santo Entierro (Holy Burial) or Señor del Sacromonte was begun to replace an earlier pagan cult at this site. The La Asuncion Church was begun in 1547, along with a number of other places of worship. Construction was finished in 1564. The tower was not built until the mid-17th century. From the 1540s to the end of the century, there was much civil strife among the native population. Some indigenous rule was restored but it would end for good by the 17th century.
The raising of European foodstuffs such as wheat and sheep began early with commercial agriculture becoming the basis of the economy by 1550. The area also became an important pass linking Mexico City with points east with many travelers and merchants passing through. By 1599, Amecameca has become the head of a district with thirteen dependencies with an area of about 128km2.

A major earthquake occurred here in 1704 which destroyed many houses as well as the roof of the La Asuncion Church. It was repaired from 1712 to 1719.

The area remained a farming area, mostly with family plots through the rest of the colonial period. During the Mexican War of Independence, there was restlessness here among the population, but no major incidents. In 1812, a number of natives from here fought in the war under Leonardo Bravo in other places. The municipality was mostly likely founded in 1824 along with the founding of Mexico State. U.S. troops passed through here during the Mexican–American War. In 1833, Amecameca was part of the state of Mexico in the eastern prefecture. In 1861, the settlement gained official town status from the state due to its historical and economic importance. The municipal palace was built in 1899.

In the last 19th and early 20th century, Amecameca was the scene of several industrialization projects including a beer brewery, wheat mills and workshops producing saddles and metal objects. There was some minting of copper, silver and gold as well. In 1871, Father Fortino Hipolito Vera y Talona founded a number of business and cultural enterprises such as the first polytechnic school and a press which printed both religious and cultural articles. Until the Mexican Revolution, most of the arable land in the area was owned by large haciendas such as the Tomacoco, Coapexco and Panohaya. In 1910, Francisco I. Madero was in Amecameca. From a railroad car, he gave a speech against Porfirio Díaz. From 1911 on, the military revolt against the Diaz government was mostly carried out here by Zapatistas, which gained recruits from Amecameca and by 1917, the area was a Zapatista stronghold. The area was important to rebels as it provided materials such as paper, wood, alcohol, charcoal and foodstuffs. After the war, agricultural lands here were redistributed in 1925.

In 1919, there was a major eruption of the Popocatépetl volcano, killing seventeen people in the municipality.
In the 1950s, much of the city was renovated including the main plaza, market and Hidalgo Street. The road to the Sanctuary of Sacromonte was improved and stairs added to climb the hill. Since then, the town of Amecameca has grown into a small city. However, there is not enough employment here and many commute to Mexico City to work.
The state proclaimed the town a cultural heritage of Mexico State in 1980 and was designated the &quot;Capital del Alpinismo Nacional&quot; in 1992.(Capital of Mexican Alpinism).

In the 2000s, Grupo Walmart in Mexico began to construct a supermarket (Bodega Aurrerá) in the old section of Amecameca but INAH suspended construction. The reason for the suspension was that it would cover nearly a city block and damage older buildings protected by the federal agency.

==Geography==

As municipal seat, the town of Amecameca is the local governing authority for more than 130 other named communities, which over an area of 181.72km2. The municipality borders the municipalities of Tlalmanalco, Atlautla, Ozumba, Ayapango and Juchitepec with the state of Puebla to the east. 181.72km2. About 65% of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in the town proper. At the end of the 19th century, about 85% of the population spoke Nahuatl, but today less than 200 speakers remain.

The municipality is situated on the foothills of the Sierra Nevada between the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl and in the Moctezuma-Panuco River. The Sierra Nevada is the most important geographical feature of the region and forms the eastern border of the municipality. These volcanoes are responsible for the compositions of the soils here as well as the source of most of the municipality&#x27;s fresh water. The average altitude in these mountains is 4,000 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. Although near the active volcano, Amecameca is considered to be at a lower risk than other communities in the area because of the shape of Popocatépetl&#x27;s cone and the large ravines that are found in this area. The latter offers protection against lava flows and runoff from melting snow. However, the area remains part of the evacuation zone in the event of a major eruption. There is a lookout station on Sacromonte hill which is used by civil defense when the volcano is more active. The area has an eruption warning system of three colors—red, yellow and green—which depend on the status of Popocatepetl. Green means that the volcano is quiet, yellow that there is activity and caution is advised and red indicates a current or imminent eruption. When the status turns to yellow, tourism to the area plummets to about half normal.

Fully within the municipality, the most important elevation is the Sacromonte. The main river there is the Alcalican, which forms from the snowmelt of Iztaccihualt. Its name means “in the house of water”. Most of the other streams and springs of the municipality are fed by the Sierra Nevada mountains. The climate is temperate and somewhat wet (cb(w2)) with most rains coming between May and October. Temperatures generally vary between 2 °C and 24 °C although temperatures of -8C and 34C are not uncommon.

This area, especially in the rainy season, has an abundance of wild edible plants, especially mushrooms. Undeveloped areas in the lower mountains areas are mostly covered by forests of pine, oak and cypress, with trees reaching over 30 meters in height. However, deforestation is an issue both for the loss of trees and the remaining forests’ ability to resist fires and plagues, with about twenty percent of forested area lost in last decades of the 20th century. Grazing cattle often inhibits reforestation. Higher up, the forests are dominated by fir trees with some pines and cedars. At the highest elevations near the tree line, only one species of pine is found, Pinus hartwagii. Above the tree line are alpine meadows. Small mammals, especially rabbits are common here as a number of reptiles and a variety of birds. The area used to have larger species such as white-tailed deer but these have been hunted to extinction.

Most of the municipality now is dedicated to agriculture and livestock. The main crop is corn along with other grains such as alfalfa, wheat and oats. There are a significant number of orchards here producing walnuts, pears, apples, capulins and other fruit. The municipality is the major producer of walnuts in Mexico. Livestock raised here includes pigs, cattle, sheep and domestic fowl. One important agricultural activity there is the production and conservation of traditional varieties of corn. Like other communities in the area, there are three main varieties of corn planted where as well as a number of minor varieties. These are planted mostly as a trial or because of their special characteristics, not to compete with the three main varieties. In local markets, these farmers are able to sell these local varieties as well as exchange seed to maintain genetic variety.

There is some industry there, which employs about a third of the workforce. The main ones are Los Molinos de la Covadonga, La Harinera Amecameca, Hilos Cadena, which produced milled products and thread. In addition, there are small workshops which produce saddles, ironwork and machine pieces. Most commerce occurs in the municipal seat, mostly with the sale of staple foods and other basic necessities. Market days are Monday, Wednesday and Sunday when the town is covered in portable stalls in a tradition called the &quot;tianguis&quot;. In addition, there are several hotels and other businesses that cater to tourists. This sector of the economy employ about 45% of the municipality&#x27;s population.
Outside of the town proper, there are a number of other tourist attractions in the municipality. There is one registered archeological site in the municipality called the &quot;Piedra del Conejo&quot; (&quot;Rabbit Stone&quot;) or &quot;Monumental solsticial de Tomacoco&quot; (&quot;Solstice monument of Tomacoco&quot;). One of the major attractions is the Panoaya Hacienda. The main hacienda building houses the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Museum; it is featured in the reverse of the $200 pesos Mexican note. Sor Juana come to live at Panoaya in 1651 when she was three years old to live with her mother and grandfather. She learned to read and write and stayed until she was sent to live in Mexico City in 1663. The hacienda lay in ruins for the last century or so until it was rehabilitated in 1999 at a cost of more than 10 million pesos. A building next to this one is the International Museum of Volcanos which exhibits of Mexico two most famous volcanoes and others in the world. The hacienda&#x27;s main building now serves as the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Museum, run by INAH. Much of the rest of the hacienda land is leased to a recreational park which is best known for its petting zoo which contains tame deer.

Another major attraction is the Bosque de los Arboles de Navidad (Christmas Tree Forest), one of the few places in Mexico where one can go and cut their own tree. The Bosque plants trees such as the &quot;vikingo mexiquense&quot; and the &quot;vikingo canadiense&quot; coming here has become a tradition for many families in the Mexico City area. It is a business that was conceived forty years ago as a way to help preserve the forest here as well as benefit economically. Visitors come to spend a day in the area and can cut trees only from designated locations. Picnicking is permitted with the requirement that no garbage is left behind. The Christmas tree area covers 300 acres (120 hectares), and cut trees are left to regrow instead of being killed. The park also hosts food stalls and a Christmas market, selling about 30,000 trees per year and employing 50 permanent and 250 seasonal workers. The money earned from the enterprise helps to preserve more wild areas of the mountains here. This work has earned a Premio Nacional de Ecología (National Ecology Prize). The only problem the forest experiences is that the enterprise is so popular that the roads leading to the area are jammed with traffic.

Lesser-known attractions include the Eco Parque San Pedro, the Temazcal Park and the Agua Viva monastery. The Eco Parque San Pedro (San Pedro Ecological Park) is located between the Amecameca and Nexpayantla rivers just outside the municipal seat in the community of San Pedro Nexapa. It stands at 2870 meters above sea level, very close to the Puebla state line and has a cold, wet climate. The park is between the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanos near the Cortés Pass. The park was created as a way to manage and preserve the natural resources of the area. It is a recreational area for sports such as hiking and also contains the second largest labyrinth of its type in the world created with over 38,000 cedar trees over an extension of 10,000m2. There is also a &quot;zoo&quot; of sculpted plants made to form animals using plants native to the area. The Temazcal Park is a natural area with dirt and stone paths. It contains a variety of pine trees and medicinal plants and is home to white tailed deer, foxes and other wildlife. Activities available here are hiking, mountain biking, camping and other nature sports. The &quot;Agua Viva&quot; (Living Water) monastery is a Dominican institution located at the foothills of Iztaccíhuatl. There are still monks here that offer mass. The Cortés Pass is located 30 minutes from the town, which is a space between the two volcanoes and from where Cortés had his first view of the Valley of Mexico.

<doc id="325643" wikidata="Q1757215" url="?curid=325643" title="Naginatajutsu">
<text>is the Japanese martial art of wielding the . The naginata is a weapon resembling the European glaive and the Chinese guan dao. Most naginatajutsu practiced today is in a modernized form, a &quot;gendai budō&quot;, in which competitions also are held.

==History==
===Origins===
The &quot;naginata&quot; originates from development of the Japanese spear called &quot;hoko yari&quot; of the later 1st millennium AD. It has been suggested that it developed along the same lines as Okinawan kobudō weapons as a modified farming tool. Others say that creative samurai in need of a longer weapon attached a sword to a pole. Perhaps the simplest explanation is the natural development of polearms. Polearms are intended as mass weapons, to be used not just by individual warriors, but by formations of soldiers together on field battles and not for dueling. When fighting in close order, two-handed cut-and-thrust weapons, such as halberds and glaives, are much more efficient than mere spears or swords because of their versatility compared to spears and longer reach compared to swords. Fighting in massed formation does not require similar individual weapon-handling skills as required by a skilled swordsman. Naginata are almost identical in appearance to both the glaive and the guan dao, and it is most likely result of parallel evolution.

===Pre-Modern Japan===

The oldest account of naginata is in the Kojiki and battle paintings by Tengyo no ran, in 980 AD (Heian period). The naginata was a weapon widely used mainly by Onna-musha (女武者, warrior women), Sôhei (僧兵; warrior monks), and Yamabushi (山伏, mountain monks).

In the early history of its use, the naginata was primarily used against cavalry, as its length kept the wielder a safe distance from horses and their riders.

Its use became popular around the year 1000 AD. In the centuries that followed, the naginata&#x27;s popularity rose and fell as tactics used in battle evolved.

The importance of naginata for samurai can be attested by the relatively large number of styles of bujutsu that have incorporated it in their curriculum, to name a few: Suiō-ryū, Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, Tendō-ryū, Toda-ha Bukō-ryū, and the Yōshin-ryū.

During the Tokugawa period (1603–1868), the naginata was transformed into a status symbol to distinguish women of samurai families, as well as being the primary means for a woman to defend her home while her husband was away in times of war. This period also saw the propagation of the naginata as a feminine art and the weapon serving as more of a symbol of devotion to a woman&#x27;s family. 

=== Modern Japan ===
With the end of the Samurai era and the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan was modernized and many of the old practices fell into disuse. During the Shōwa era, Naginata became part of the physical education school curriculum for girls. The practice at this time was called &quot;naginata-dō&quot; (薙刀道; lit. &quot;way of the naginata&quot;).

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the practice was remodeled, resulting in two naginata practices: &quot;koryū naginata&quot; (古流薙刀; &quot;old&quot; or classical naginata) and &quot;atarashii naginata&quot; (新しいなぎなた; &quot;new&quot; or modern naginata).

Despite the differences, the two ways of practicing naginata share many things in common. In both, the practice is systematized according to a tradition of strokes, cuts, and movements of the left and right in various directions, promoting training with an emphasis on the form and beauty of the movement.

==Koryū Naginata==
Naginata is found as part of the curriculum of several styles of Kobudô. Many &quot;koryū&quot; &quot;ryūha&quot;, such as the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, Maniwa Nen-ryū, Jikishinkage-ryu Naginatajutsu, Tendō-ryū and Hokushin Ittō-ryū include naginatajutsu in their curriculum, as do arts such as Shidare Yanagi-ryū and budo organizations such as the Bujinkan. The practice and grading system varies from style to style, as well as the use or not of protectors for the practice of combat.

Some of the most common known styles that incorporate naginata in their curriculum are:

===Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū===
Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō Ryū is the oldest style of koryū, and Japan&#x27;s only tradition recognized as &quot;bunkazai&quot; (文化財), or Japanese cultural treasure. The characteristics of this school are dynamic techniques and long katas, with movements such as jumps, turns with the body and ascending and descending cuts used in alternation.

Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō Ryū has seven kata with naginata, divided into two sets.

===Suiō-ryū===
Suiō Ryū Iai Kenpō is one of the most complete styles, with several weapons in its curriculum. The naginata occupies an important highlight, having been incorporated by the founder of the style, Mima Yochizaemon Kagenobu (1577–1665), who learned to use this weapon with the sōhei monks during the &quot;musha shugyō&quot; (武者修行; warrior pilgrimage) that he made in the first part of his life.

Naginata kata are divided into three sets: naginata against sword, naginata against naginata, and solo forms in which techniques used on battlefields to slaughter horses are practiced.

===Other traditions===
Other important traditions that teach Naginata are:

*Tendo Ryu Naginata-jutsu
*Jiki-shinkage Ryu Naginata-jutsu
*Toda-ha Buko Ryu Naginata-jutsu
*Higo Koryu Naginata-jutsu
*Yoshin Ryu Naginata-jutsu

==Atarashii Naginata==
Today, the naginata is most often used in the form of a sport called , or simply &quot;Naginata,&quot; which uses kendo-style protective equipment and wood or bamboo weapons. In Japanese, Naginata, the sport, is distinguished from the naginata, the weapon, by being rendered in hiragana (なぎなた) rather than in kanji (長刀). In other languages, the name &quot;Naginata&quot; is usually capitalized to make the same distinction.

It is most common in Japan for Naginata to be practiced by women; in other countries, the gender balance is more even. Outside Japan, Naginata is practiced in Europe, Australia, North and South America. Naginata is governed in Japan by the All Japan Naginata Federation (AJNF), and outside Japan by the International Naginata Federation (INF).
===The practice===
The first associations for the practice of Atarashi Naginata were formed in 1950, bringing together more than 15 different styles.

In 1953, the Zen Nihon Naginata Renmei – Japanese Confederation of Naginata was established, which regulated the official style of this art, bringing together the techniques of the various existing styles, mainly Tendô Ryu and Jiki Shinkague Ryu.

Atarashi Naginata started to be written, in Japanese, using the hiragana characters, instead of Kanji.

Atarashi Naginata currently has more than 80,000 practitioners in Japan and several countries in the West.

Currently, the regulation of Atarashi Naginata is carried out worldwide by the International Federation of Naginata – INF. INF was created in 1990, bringing together several countries and is divided into three sections: Japan, Europe and the Americas.

In Japan, Atarashi Naginata is governed by the All Japan Naginata Federation, represented in Brazil by the Naginata Association of Brazil.

===Equipment===
The real Naginata, with a steel blade and edge, is only used in demonstrations, with rare exceptions. Two types of Naginata are generally used for training: the first has instead of the blade two curved and very flexible bamboo strips that allow the absorption of the impact being used in contact training and championships and even in the practice of basic pre-ordered forms (Shikake -Ôji); the second is made of solid wood, suitable for training advanced pre-ordered forms (Kata).

Atarashi Naginata practitioners dress with protectors during contact training and championships. Bōgu, as this protective clothing is called, comprises head and throat protectors (Men), wrists (Kote), trunk (Do) and shins / tibia (Suneate). Only hits targeted at these protected points are allowed.

In comparison to Kendo, the Men has shorter side flaps, the Kote has articulation for the index finger, thus allowing for better handling of the weapon, and finally the use of the Suneate that is not used in Kendo.

===Philosophical aspects===

The Japanese Federation of Naginata has acted with the following concept and principle:

*Promote harmony between the mind and the body through training.
According to the Japanese Federation of Naginata, through the correct guidance of Atarashi Naginata one seeks to perfect the technique, cultivate the spirit, increase vitality and also:

*Train correctly within the principles of Naginata
*Respect discipline
*Respect etiquette and cooperate with others
*Learn and preserve traditional Japanese culture
*Cultivate mind
*Develop spirit and body
*Promote peace and prosperity among people

===Gradings===
There are six elementary mudansha (sem dan) ranks, from the most basic, 6 kyū (rokkyū), to the most advanced, 1 kyū (ikkyū). There are five yudansha (com dan) ranks, from the lowest, 1 dan (shodan), to the highest, 5 dan (godan). Instructional shogo titles may be obtained after 5th dan: these are renshi, kyoshi, and hanshi.

To be eligible for the shodan exam, a candidate must have already attained ikkyū rank. To continue through the dan ranks, practitioners must wait one year from the last exam before attempting 2nd dan, two years before 3rd dan, and three years each before 4th and 5th dan.

==Naginata in other countries==

=== Australia ===
The Australian Naginata Federation consists of three clubs, in Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Victoria.

===Brazil===
==== Atarashii Naginata ====

Atarashi Naginata is a little known martial art in Brazil. This art was practiced in the Japanese colony during the pre-World War II period, but there are practically no records about it. The most outstanding teacher at the time was Shizu Furumoto sensei.

The current group of practitioners started their activities just over 30 years ago, when Professor Hatsue Takahashi came from Japan in 1987 and made demonstrations in São Paulo, forming the first group of practitioners of this martial art. This small group gradually increased, with the guidance of the same teacher Takahashi, who sporadically came to Brazil.

In 1993, the Association of Naginata do Brasil – ANB was created, which brings together practitioners and supporters of Atarashi Naginata, whose affiliation with the International Federation of Naginata – INF, was approved and accepted as its 8th member. This made it possible for Brazil to participate, officially in INF events. So in 1993 Brazil was at the 3rd International Friendship Tournament held in Los Angeles – USA and at the 1st World Championship in Tokyo – Japan. In 1995 it was at the Seminar and Tournament in Yamagata – Japan. Present at the 2nd World Championship in Paris – France and in 1996 Brazil had the great honor of hosting the 4th International Friendship Tournament. In 2018, ANB was honored to host the International Naginata Seminar that took place in São Paulo. 

Currently in Brazil there is a teacher authorized by INF to teach the art of Atarashi Naginata: Yasue Morita Sensei, with a 4th Dan degree and have maintained a training group through ANB in São Paulo. Responsible for the dissemination of this martial art and for the guidance to people interested in learning it, in accordance with the principles of Atarashi Naginata and rules of INF. In Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Manaus and Porto Alegre there are study groups supervised by ANB. He is also responsible for the study group formed in Argentina and Chile.

==== Koryū Naginata ====
In Brazil, Naginatajutsu of the Suio Ryu and Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu styles is practiced within the Brazilian Kobudo Confederation (CBKOb). Teaching within CBKob is done by its president, Sensei :pt:Jorge Kishikawa, other teachers connected to him, Are affiliated with Nihon Kobudo Kyokai (headquarters in Tokyo, Japan) – NKK – and authorized to teach the art of Naginata do Suio ryu by Soke (grandmaster) Yoshimitsu Katsuse.
The practice within CBKob also covers shiai (fighting) using bogu equipped with sune (protection of the tibia). Combat is carried out between two Naginatas (Category Naginata) and between Naginatas and swords (Category Kobudô Ishu Jiai). In this practice, the rules and techniques used differ from those of Atarashi Naginata.

<text>A Tori Amos Collection: Tales of a Librarian is the first retrospective compilation album by American singer-songwriter Tori Amos. Given the option to be involved in the project, Amos elected to take a central role in the production of the collection, released in 2003 on her former label Atlantic Records.

Amos described the compilation as a &quot;sonic autobiography&quot;, a title derived from her dislike of the term &quot;greatest hits&quot;. Recording under the premise that a librarian is a &quot;chronicler&quot;, Amos pieced together the collection in accordance with the Dewey Decimal System; so, for example, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Land, land of liberty / We&#x27;re run by a constipated man&quot;, is listed as &quot;973.938: History of North America -- Politics of Illusion&quot;. Amos revisited the mixing of many of her own favorite songs from her career, focusing on those she thought were not fully realized in their original recordings and those that she felt explained her life story. Additionally, Amos added two new songs and two re-recorded B-sides: &quot;Angels&quot;, &quot;Snow Cherries from France&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Mary&quot;, respectively. The latter two compositions were originally recorded in 1990 during sessions for &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; (1992).

&quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot; were released as promotional singles from the album.

<text>Alexander Rüstow (8 April 1885 – 30 June 1963) was a German sociologist and economist. At the Colloque Walter Lippmann in August 1938 he popularised the term &quot;neoliberalism&quot;. He became one of the fathers of the &quot;Social Market Economy&quot; that shaped the economy of West Germany after World War II. Rüstow was the grandnephew of Wilhelm Rüstow, the grandson of Cäsar Rüstow and the father of Dankwart Rustow.

==Life==
Rüstow was born in Wiesbaden in the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau in to the family of a Prussian military officer. From 1903 till 1908, he studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, philology, law and economics, at the universities of Göttingen, Munich and Berlin. In 1908, he obtained his doctorate under Paul Hensel, at the University of Erlangen, on a mathematical topic, Russell&#x27;s paradox. He then worked at the Teubner publishing house in Berlin, until 1911, when he started working on his habilitation, on the knowledge theory of Parmenides. He had to interrupt his work though at the outbreak of the First World War, when he volunteered for the German Army.

After the war, Rüstow, then still a socialist, participated in the November Revolution, and obtained a post at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, working on the nationalization process of the coal industry in the Ruhr Area. Disillusioned with socialist planning, he started working for the VdMA, the German Engineering Federation in 1924. The engineering companies in Germany suffered much by the protected and subsidized coal and mine industry.

In the 1930s, the climate in Germany became too unfriendly for Rüstow; he was blacklisted in 1933 and fled to Switzerland, where he was offered a chair in economic geography and history at the University of Istanbul, Turkey. In Istanbul, he worked on his magnum opus, &quot;Ortsbestimmung der Gegenwart&quot; (in English published as &quot;Freedom and Domination&quot;), a critique of civilization. In 1938 at the Colloque Walter Lippmann, it was Rüstow who created the term &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27; to separate new liberalism from classical liberalism. Rüstow promoted the concept of the social market economy, and this concept promotes a strong role for the state with respect to the market, which is in many ways different from the ideas which are nowadays connected with the term neoliberalism.

In 1949, Rüstow returned to Germany and obtained a chair at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained until his retirement in 1956. He died in 1963 at age 78 in Heidelberg.

==Ordoliberalism==

Together with Walter Eucken, Wilhelm Röpke and Franz Böhm, Rüstow provided the necessary foundational work of Ordoliberalism.

<text>Cäsar Rüstow (18 June 1826 – 4 July 1866) was a Prussian soldier and military writer.

The brother of Wilhelm Rüstow and Alexander Rüstow, Cäsar Rüstow was one of the foremost experts of his time in the design and construction of military rifles, and the writer of several treatises on that subject, notably &quot;Die Kriegshandfeuerwaffen&quot; (Berlin, 1857–64). Both Alexander and Cäsar fell on the field of battle in the war of 1866, Cäsar at the Battle of Dermbach. He was the grandfather of the sociologist Alexander Rüstow.

<doc id="325663" wikidata="Q7225687" url="?curid=325663" title="Pollination management">
<text>[[Pollination management|Honey bee on [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]]]]&lt;br&gt;[[Honey bee]]s are especially well adapted to collecting and moving pollen, thus are the most commonly used crop pollinators. Note the light brown [[pollen]] in the [[pollen basket]].

Pollination management is the horticultural practices that accomplish or enhance pollination of a crop, to improve yield or quality, by understanding of the particular crop&#x27;s pollination needs, and by knowledgeable management of pollenizers, pollinators, and pollination conditions.

While people think first of the European honey bee when pollination comes up, in fact there are many different means of pollination management that are used, both other insects and other mechanisms. There are other insects commercially available that are more efficient, like the blue orchard bee for fruit and nut trees, local bumblebees better specialized for some other crops, hand pollination that is essential for production of hybrid seeds and some greenhouse situations, and even pollination machines.

==Pollinator decline==
With the decline of both wild and domestic pollinator populations, pollination management is becoming an increasingly important part of horticulture. Factors that cause the loss of pollinators include pesticide misuse, unprofitability of beekeeping for honey, rapid transfer of pests and diseases to new areas of the globe, urban/suburban development, changing crop patterns, clearcut logging (particularly when mixed forests are replaced by monoculture pine), clearing of hedgerows and other wild areas, bad diet because of loss of floral biodiversity, and a loss of nectar corridors for migratory pollinators. With the declining habitat and resources available to sustain bee populations, populations are declining. 

==Importance==
The increasing size of fields and orchards (monoculture) increase the importance of pollination management. Monoculture can cause a brief period when pollinators have more food resources than they can use (but monofloral diet can reduce their immune system) while other periods of the year can bring starvation or pesticide contamination of food sources. Most nectar source and pollen source throughout the growing season to build up their numbers.

Crops that traditionally have had managed pollination include apple, almonds, pears, some plum and cherry varieties, blueberries, cranberries, cucumbers, cantaloupe, watermelon, alfalfa seeds, onion seeds, and many others. Some crops that have traditionally depended entirely on chance pollination by wild pollinators need pollination management nowadays to make a profitable crop. Many of these were at one time universally turning to honeybees, but as science has shown that honeybees are actually inefficient pollinators, demand for other managed pollinators has risen. While honeybees may visit dozens of different kinds of flowers, diluting the orchard pollen they carry, the Blue orchard bee will visit only the intended tree, producing a much higher fertilization rate. The focus on the specific tree also makes the orchard bee 100 times more efficient at pollinating, per bee.

Some crops, especially when planted in a monoculture situation, require a very high level of pollinators to produce economically viable crops, especially if depending on the more generalized honeybee. This may be because of lack of attractiveness of the blossoms, or from trying to pollinate with an alternative when the native pollinator is extinct or rare. These include crops such as alfalfa, cranberries, and kiwifruit. This technique is known as saturation pollination. In many such cases, various native bees are vastly more efficient at pollination (e.g., with blueberries), but the inefficiency of the honey bees is compensated for by using large numbers of hives, the total number of foragers thereby far exceeding the local abundance of native pollinators. In a very few cases, it has been possible to develop commercially viable pollination techniques that use the more efficient pollinators, rather than continued reliance on honey bees, as in the management of the alfalfa leafcutter bee. 

In the case of the kiwifruit, its flowers do not even produce nectar, so that honeybees are reluctant to even visit them, unless present in such overwhelming numbers that they do so incidentally. This has led bumblebee pollination companies to begin offering their services for kiwifruit, as they appear to be far more efficient at the job than honeybees, even more efficient than hand pollination.

It is estimated that about one hive per acre will sufficiently pollinate watermelons. In the 1950s when the woods were full of wild bee trees, and beehives were normally kept on most South Carolina farms, a farmer who grew ten acres (4 ha) of watermelons would be a large grower and probably had all the pollination needed. But today&#x27;s grower may grow 200 acres (80 ha), and, if lucky, there might be one bee tree left within range. The only option in the current economy is to bring beehives to the field during blossom time.

==Types of pollinators==
Organisms that are currently being used as pollinators in managed pollination are honey bees, bumblebees, alfalfa leafcutter bees, and orchard mason bees. Other species are expected to be added to this list as this field develops. Humans also can be pollinators, as the gardener who hand pollinates her squash blossoms, or the Middle Eastern farmer, who climbs his date palms to pollinate them.

The Cooperative extension service recommends one honey bee hive per acre (2.5 hives per hectare) for standard watermelon varieties to meet this crop&#x27;s pollination needs. In the past, when fields were small, pollination was accomplished by a mix of bees kept on farms, bumblebees, carpenter bees, feral honey bees in hollow trees and other insects. Today, with melons planted in large tracts, the grower may no longer have hives on the farm; he may have poisoned many of the pollinators by spraying blooming cotton; he may have logged off the woods, removing hollow trees that provided homes for bees, and pushed out the hedgerows that were home for solitary native bees and other pollinating insects.

==Planning for improved pollination==

Before pollination needs were understood, orchardists often planted entire blocks of apples of a single variety. Because apples are self-sterile, and different members of a single variety are genetic clones (equivalent to a single plant), this is not a good idea. Growers now supply pollenizers, by planting crab apples interspersed in the rows, or by grafting crab apple limbs on some trees. Pollenizers can also be supplied by putting drum bouquets of crab apples or a compatible apple variety in the orchard blocks.

The field of pollination management cannot be placed wholly within any other field, because it bridges several fields. It draws from horticulture, apiculture, zoology (especially entomology), ecology, and botany.

==Improving pollination with suboptimal bee densities==
Growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, to less than 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% in the same time period. To make matters worse, in the past five years we have seen a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honeybees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings.

<text>Aleurite is an unconsolidated sediment with a texture intermediately between sand and clay, similar to silt, with particle sizes ranging from .

== Etymology ==
The name aleurite is derived from the Greek word &quot;aleuron&quot;, meaning &quot;flour&quot;.

== Description ==
The term aleurite is mainly used in Russian geology, where it is described from the Baltic and Kara Seas, and as a derivative in Mongolia, such as the Dushihin Formation, where it occurs in lenses. Aleurite primarily comprises mineral grains (quartz, feldspar, mica, and others). The term aleurite has been proposed by Soviet petrographer A. N. Zavaritskiy in 1930. Aleurite is used in the production of the cement and building ceramics.

<text>Myrsini (, before 1915: Σουλεϊμάναγα - &quot;Souleimanaga&quot;) is a town in Elis, Greece. It is part of the municipal unit of Lechaina since 1997. Myrsini lies in a flat coastal plain that stretches from Amaliada to Kato Achaia. It is 3 km southwest of Lechaina and 3 km northwest of Andravida.

==History==
Myrsini is named after the ancient city of Myrsinos or Myrtountion (named in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; V), which was located in the area. According to Homer, Myrsinos took part in the Trojan War together with all of the Eleans (&quot;Iliad&quot; II.616). During the Byzantine Empire, a village named &quot;Agios Nikolaos&quot; (St Nicholas) was located in the area. Only part of its church altar survives today. In the 16th century, the inhabitants moved further inland to escape corsair raids and founded the present village. During the Ottoman era, the village was named &quot;Suleymanaga&quot; (Σουλεϊμάναγα), after a local Ottoman governor named Suleyman Agha.

Along with the rest of the Peloponnese, the village was conquered in 1685 by the Republic of Venice during the Morean War, but was recovered by the Ottomans in 1715. It became a part of Greece after the Greek War of Independence, and was renamed to its present name in 1915.

==Population==
==Notable people==

Notable residents of Myrsini include:
* Peter Katholos former footballer who played for Sydney Olympic F.C. and Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.

<text>The Caribe Hilton is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and is owned by Park Hotels &amp; Resorts and managed by Hilton Worldwide. 

==History==
In early 1946, as part of the Puerto Rican industrialization effort known as Operation Bootstrap, the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co. decided to erect a modern luxury hotel. The facility would be owned by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but leased to the multinational hospitality operator that provided the best bid. The hotel would have 300 bedrooms and the necessary ancillary facilities, and be located adjacent to Fortín de San Gerónimo in Puerta de Tierra.

A competition was held to select the design, with three architectural firms in Puerto Rico invited: Schimmelpfennig, Ruiz y González; The Office of Henry Klumb; and Toro Ferrer. Two additional firms from Florida were also invited to participate: Frederick G. Seelman from Palm Beach and Robert Swartburg from Miami. These two firms submitted Spanish Renaissance-style designs, while the three Puerto Rican firms presented modern designs inspired by the International style. The final design chosen was by Toro Ferrer, who also designed the Modern Movement-style Supreme Court Building in San Juan.

To operate the hotel, the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co. invited seven leading American hotel firms. Conrad Hilton, being from New Mexico, opened his letter back with &quot;Mi estimado amigo&quot; and won over the Puerto Ricans.

The creation of the hotel represented a partnership between the Puerto Rican government and U.S business. Americans viewed the creation of the hotel as a symbol of their power to create material progress. A majority of Puerto Rican citizens did not approve of the decision to build the hotel. They believed that the public funds would have better suited the island inhabitants if they were invested in improving education and social welfare. San Juan&#x27;s fire chief of the time disapproved the government&#x27;s decision to &quot;degrade itself by buying tourists.&quot; Articles published by &quot;El Mundo&quot; in 1952 saw the American tourists as selfish people who did not care about the island and ones who will in the future convince the Puerto Rican people to serve them.

The Caribe Hilton opened on December 9, 1949. The government-backed Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corp. (PRIDCO) spent $7 million to build and furnish the hotel. After it was built, the government leased the hotel to the Hilton Corp. on a 20-year lease. The hotel was the first in Puerto Rico to offer radios in every room and individually controlled air conditioners.

Guests for the opening included Gloria Swanson, Eastern Air Lines President Eddie Rickenbacker, David Rockefeller and numerous other celebrities and notables.

The hotel claims to be the birthplace of the Piña colada. In 1954, bartender Ramón “Monchito” Marrero spent three months creating a mix of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. The drink was first served on August 15, 1954.

The original hotel was expanded over the years from 300 rooms to 646 rooms. After managing the hotel for 48 years, Hilton International bought the property in 1998. Hilton closed the hotel the following year for a complete renovation, lasting nine months. It reopened on December 25, 1999 celebrating its 50th anniversary after $50 million in renovations.

In 2005, the hotel was expanded with the huge Paseo Caribe complex, including shops, restaurants, and 264 villas marketed as the Condado Lagoon Villas.

In January 2017, ownership of the hotel was transferred to Park Hotels &amp; Resorts when that company was spun off from Hilton Worldwide. In September 2017, the hotel was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria, forcing it to close. It reopened in May 2019, following a US$100 million renovation.

==Famous guests==
Its first of many famous guests were Gloria Swanson and Gertrude Ederle. Between the 1960s and 1980s, many important performers either worked or stayed at the Caribe Hilton, including Marco Antonio Muñiz. Other famous guests have included many world champion boxers during Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;golden era of boxing&quot;. The national basketball teams of twelve countries also stayed there for 2003&#x27;s pre-Olympic tournament of the Americas. 

==In popular culture==
Part of the television film &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie&quot; was filmed in the outdoor pool area of the hotel. It is also the setting for Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;. &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; was also filmed in the lobby of the hotel.

<text>The Merry Pranksters were followers of American author Ken Kesey. Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived communally at Kesey&#x27;s homes in California and Oregon, and are noted for the sociological significance of a lengthy road trip they took in the summer of 1964, traveling across the United States in a psychedelic painted school bus called &quot;Furthur&quot;, organizing parties, and giving out LSD. During this time they met many of the guiding lights of the 1960s cultural movement and presaged what are commonly thought of as hippies with odd behavior, tie-dyed and red, white, and blue clothing, and renunciation of normal society, which they dubbed The Establishment. Tom Wolfe chronicled their early escapades in his 1968 book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, including a bit on the same epic 1964 cross-country trip on &quot;Furthur&quot; - a sojourn to Houston, stopping to visit Kesey&#x27;s friend the novelist Larry McMurtry.

Notable members of the group include Kesey&#x27;s best friend Ken Babbs, Carolyn &quot;Mountain Girl&quot; Garcia, Lee Quarnstrom, and Neal Cassady. Stewart Brand, Dorothy Fadiman, Paul Foster, George Walker, the Warlocks (later known as the Grateful Dead), Del Close (then a lighting designer for the Grateful Dead), Wavy Gravy, Paul Krassner, and Kentucky Fab Five writers Ed McClanahan and Gurney Norman (who overlapped with Kesey and Babbs as creative writing graduate students at Stanford University) were associated with the group to varying degrees.

These events are also documented by one of the original pranksters, Lee Quarnstrom, in his memoir, &quot;When I Was a Dynamiter&quot;.

==Origin of name==
In an interview on BBC World Service in August 2014, Ken Babbs suggested that the name &quot;The Merry Pranksters&quot; was his idea:

==Membership==

===On the bus===
Although a great many friends and associates spent time with Kesey at his La Honda, California ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco, the core group of 14 people who became the &#x27;Merry Band of Pranksters&#x27; that drove across the country in 1964 were:
* Ken Kesey (The Chief, Captain Flag, or Swashbuckler), author (1935–2001)
* Neal Cassady (Sir Speed Limit), driver (eastbound), author (1926–1968)
* Cathy Casamo (Stark Naked), actress, girlfriend of Larry Hankin (1938–1992)
* Ron Bevirt (Hassler), photographer (1939–)
* Ken Babbs (Intrepid Traveler), author, boyfriend of Paula Sundsten (1939–)
* John Babbs (Sometimes Missing), Ken Babbs&#x27; older brother (1937–2012)
* Jane Burton (Generally Famished), Stanford philosophy professor, pregnant at the time
* Sandy Lehmann-Haupt (Dis-Mount), sound engineer, younger brother of Carl Lehmann-Haupt (1942–2001)
* Paula Sundsten (Gretchen Fetchin or Slime Queen), girlfriend of Ken Babbs
* Mike Hagen (Mal Function), cameraman

==Eastward bus journey==
On June 17, 1964, Kesey and 13 Merry Pranksters boarded &quot;Furthur&quot; at Kesey&#x27;s ranch in La Honda, California, and set off eastward. Kesey wanted to see what would happen when hallucinogenic-inspired spontaneity confronted what he saw as the banality and conformity of American society. Ken Babbs has suggested that the bus trip reversed the historic American westward movement.

The trip&#x27;s original purpose was to celebrate the publication of Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1964) and to visit the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City. The Pranksters were enthusiastic users of marijuana, amphetamines, and LSD, and in the process of their journey are said to have &quot;turned on&quot; many people by introducing them to these drugs.

The psychedelically painted bus&#x27;s stated destination — &quot;furthur&quot; — was the Merry Pranksters&#x27; goal: a destination that could be reached only through the expansion of one&#x27;s own perception of reality.

Novelist Robert Stone, who met the bus on its arrival in New York, wrote in his memoir &quot;Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties&quot; (2007) that those accompanying Kesey on the trip were Neal Cassady (described by Stone as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest driver, who could roll a joint while backing a 1937 Packard onto the lip of the Grand Canyon&quot;), Ken Babbs (&quot;fresh from the Nam, full of radio nomenclature, and with a command voice that put cops to flight&quot;), Jane Burton (&quot;a pregnant young philosophy professor who declined no challenges&quot;), George Walker, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt (dis-MOUNT), Mike Hagen (Mal Function), Ron Bevirt (Hassler), Chuck Kesey, Dale Kesey, John Babbs, Steve Lambrecht and Paula Sundstren (aka Gretchin Fetchin, Slime Queen).

Zane Kesey and Simon Babbs edited the video and audio clips made by the Pranksters on the trip to produce a DVD (1999) called simply &quot;The Acid Test&quot;, which is distributed by Key-z Productions.

==Hells Angels==
Kesey and the Pranksters also had a relationship with the outlaw motorcycle gang the Hells Angels, whom Kesey introduced to LSD. The details of their relationship are documented in Wolfe&#x27;s above-mentioned book, in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; (1966), and in Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poem about the Kesey/Angels relationship, titled &quot;First Party at Ken Kesey&#x27;s with Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (December 1965).

==Later events==
In 1969, &quot;Furthur&quot; and the Pranksters (minus Kesey) attended the Woodstock rock festival. In the same year, they attended the Texas Pop Festival at Lewisville, Texas.

Kesey&#x27;s &quot;Demon Box&quot; (1986), a collection of short pieces, several about the Merry Pranksters, was a critical success. A subsequent novel, &quot;Sailor Song&quot; (1992), was not, with critics complaining it was too spacey for comprehension. In 1994, Kesey toured with the Pranksters, performing &quot;Twister: A Ritual Reality in Three Quarters Plus Overtime if Necessary&quot;, a play he wrote in 1989 about the millennium, influenced by L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Wizard of Oz works.

The Merry Pranksters filmed and audiotaped much of what they did on their bus trips. Some of this material has surfaced in documentaries, including the BBC&#x27;s Dancing In the Street. Some Pranksters have released footage on their own, and a version of the film edited by Kesey is available through his son Zane&#x27;s website. On August 14, 1997, Kesey appeared with the Merry Pranksters at a Phish concert during a performance of the song &quot;Colonel Forbin&#x27;s Ascent&quot; from the album &quot;The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday&quot; (1987).
Kesey and the Pranksters also helped stage The Enit Festival, held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on November 22, 1997, with Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Funky Tekno Tribe, Goldie, and Res Fest rounding out the bill.

The original Prankster bus is at Kesey&#x27;s farm in Oregon. In November 2005, it was pulled out of the swamp by Zane Kesey and family and a group of the original Merry Pranksters with the intent of restoring it. The Smithsonian Institution sought to acquire the bus, which is no longer operable, but Kesey refused, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to prank the Smithsonian by passing off a phony bus.

Kesey died of complications due to liver cancer in November 2001.

On December 10, 2003, Ken Babbs hosted a memorial to Kesey with String Cheese Incident and various other old and new Pranksters. It was held at the McDonald Theatre in Eugene, Oregon. The proceeds helped to raise money for the &quot;Ken Kesey Memorial&quot; sculpture designed by Peter Helzer. The bronze sculpture depicted a life-size Kesey reading to three children while seated on a curved granite bench covered with quotations from Kesey&#x27;s novels &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1962) and &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1964). (Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Brian Lanker supplied the image.) Other benefactors for the project include Bob Weir, Paul Newman (who starred in the 1971 film adaptation of &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;) and Michael Douglas (who produced the 1975 film version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;).

==2011 documentary==
Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood directed a documentary film &quot;Magic Trip&quot; (2011) about the Merry Pranksters, which was released on August 5, 2011.

==50th Anniversary Trip==
In April 2014, Zane, along with friend Derek Stevens, announced a Kickstarter to fund a 50th anniversary Furthur Bus Trip, offering donors a chance to ride &quot;Furthur&quot;. The fundraiser was successful, and the trip took place between June and September 2014. Over 100 participants were invited to ride on legs of the trip as a new batch of Merry Pranksters. The 2014 journey was over 15,000 miles, 53 different events, took place in 29 different states and was 75 days of Merry Prankster mayhem and fun on the road. A group of filmmakers documented the journey, releasing a film titled &quot;Going Furthur&quot;.

<text>Southland Records is a record label in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States specializing in blues and jazz.

Southland Records was founded in 1953 by Joe Mares, a clarinetist and younger brother of trumpeter Paul Mares. He created the label after realizing many musicians in New Orleans were unsigned to record labels. Mares recorded George Lewis, Papa Celestin, Sharkey Bonano, Nick LaRocca, and Raymond Burke.

Bands practiced at the label&#x27;s studio behind Mares Brothers Furs, a company established by his father, uncle, and grandfather. Sessions were recorded at concert halls and at TV and radio stations. In the 1960s, Mares sold the label to George Buck and it became part of the Jazzology Records group under the control of the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation.

<text>Trellech (occasionally spelt Trelech, Treleck or Trelleck; ) is a village and parish in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales. Located south of Monmouth and north-north-west of Tintern, Trellech lies on a plateau above the Wye Valley on the southern fringes of of woodland in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three Bronze Age standing stones are situated in the village, known as Harold&#x27;s Stones, which overlook the historic church of St Nicholas, a Grade I listed building.
Although a relatively small village in modern times, it was one of the largest towns in Wales in the 13th century, and is now a site of archaeological interest to determine its extent and role at that time. The village is designated as a conservation area. 

There are four nature reserves nearby; New Grove Flower Meadow, noted for its orchids, and Trellech Beacon are both owned by Gwent Wildlife Trust while Cleddon Bog and Croes Robert Wood are both SSSIs.

==Etymology==
It is thought that the Welsh name &quot;Tryleg&quot; probably means &#x27;conspicuous stone&#x27; and derives from the intensifying prefix &quot;try-&quot; and *&quot;lleg&quot;, an unrecorded variant of the common noun &quot;llech&quot; &#x27;stone, slab&#x27;. If so, the name probably refers to a large stone that once stood on a mound about a mile-and-a-half north of the village. Historical forms of the name vary between &quot;Try-&quot;, &quot;Tri-&quot; and &quot;Tre-&quot;. It is likely that the three standing stones known as Harold&#x27;s Stones influenced those forms that begin with &quot;Tri-&quot; (Welsh &quot;tri&quot; &#x27;three&#x27;). Another Welsh noun &quot;tre(f)&quot; &#x27;settlement, town&#x27; has probably influenced forms that begin with &quot;Tre-&quot;. The noun &quot;llech&quot;, mentioned above, has also influenced various forms of the name. The &lt;ll&gt; in the English form &quot;Trellech&quot; is given its English pronunciation (not as Welsh ). Likewise, the final &lt;ch&gt; is pronounced as not as Welsh .

The village is noteworthy because of the variety of different modern spellings of the name. Historically, up to 30 different variations of the name have been recorded, of which four are still commonly used. On each of the three roads entering the village, signs give a different spelling: &quot;Trellech&quot;, &quot;Trelleck&quot; and &quot;Trelech&quot;.

==History==
Trellech was one of the major towns of medieval Wales, the remains of which have been subject to archaeological excavations which have been sustained over many years and which continue today. It is most likely that the town was established by the De Clare family specifically for the exploitation of local supplies of iron ore from the Forest of Dean, and charcoal produced in the surrounding woodlands, to provide weapons, armour and iron work for their military advances in Wales, including the building of Caerphilly Castle. By 1288 there were 378 burgage plots recorded in Trellech, which would have made it bigger than Cardiff or Chepstow at the time. Trellech was largely destroyed in 1291 as a result of a raid following a dispute over alleged deer poaching. The Black Death struck in 1340 and again in 1350. Subsequently, the ravages of Owain Glyndŵr and his men in the early 15th century further reduced the prosperity and in consequence the importance of Trellech.

===Archaeological investigations===
Archaeological investigations at Trellech have been led since the early 1990s by the South Wales Centre for Historical and Interdisciplinary Research at the University of Wales, Newport. There is currently some dispute over the layout and development of the medieval town and its environs. In 2005, Stuart Wilson bought a field in which, he was convinced, were remains of the lost medieval town. Wilson had previously broken into sites and undermined the work of other archaeologists in the area, claiming he &quot;once sneaked onto Howell&#x27;s dig site to prove an ancient wall the professor had uncovered was really a modern field drain.&quot; .This site had first been identified as of potential interest by (the unrelated) Julia Wilson, in 1998. 

Stuart Wilson&#x27;s interest in this field and the possibility that his hunch might be correct was the subject of a 30-minute BBC Radio 4 documentary, presented by the archaeologist Francis Pryor, and entitled &quot;The Boy Who Bought a Field&quot;, broadcast on 6 March 2006. The programme revealed that Wilson had apparently discovered medieval walls and yard-paving. In 2008 the Monmouth Archaeological Society said, &quot;there is now no room for debate&quot; that the excavations by Wilson and others have identified the main part of the medieval town to be around the minor road towards Catbrook, to the south of the current village, on what is now farmland. In 2016, Wilson proposed turning the site into a camp site, research centre and tourist attraction. Some of Wilson&#x27;s claims have been criticised by academic archaeologists.

==Places of historical interest==
===Church of St Nicholas===

The Anglican parish church has been designated a Grade I listed building since 19 November 1953, and is described by Joseph Bradney as &quot;one of the largest and most handsome of the country churches in the county&quot; of Monmouthshire. With an elegant pointed and prominent steeple, a font and 17th-century sundial, it is a focal point of the village. The main part of the church building is of local Old Red Sandstone, with a three-stage tower. The spire can be seen for several miles around and is described by architectural writer John Newman as &quot;the town&#x27;s pride and joy&quot;.

A church on this site, probably a wooden structure, was endowed by Ffernfael ap Ithel and Meurig ap Tewdrig who were rulers of Gwent in the 7th and 8th centuries. The Preaching Cross in the churchyard is early Medieval in date, as is the font. The present building dates from the 13th or early 14th century. The early English Gothic stonework has been dated to between 1225 and 1272, and that of the Decorated Gothic up to 1350. The church has a large clerestoried nave, with a much smaller chancel. The &quot;impressive&quot; interior has a &quot;spendidly high&quot; tower arch, and the five-bay nave has arcades on octagonal piers. The altar rails and pulpit, dated 1640, are survivals of 17th century church interior design. At the west end of the church, directly below the window, is a Royal Coat of Arms for King Charles II dated 1683. Records are held by the church dating from 1692. Complete lists of vicars, from 1359, and churchwardens, from 1763, can be found in the entrance to the south aisle. The rear of the main church door is inscribed &quot;IHS 1595&quot;.

When the weathercock was removed from the spire in 1972 it was found to have been made in Ross-on-Wye in 1792. The original spire fell, damaging the roof of the nave, and a contemporary reference attributes this to &quot;lightning and storms&quot;. In the belfry the cage housing the three bells is of a type similar to that found in others constructed about the year 1700. At the end of the last century the church was in a neglected state and was extensively renovated and re-roofed. The Belgian slates then in place were replaced with Welsh slates in 1961. The chancel was replastered in 1972 and painted white. During 1974 considerable repairs were undertaken to the north and south aisles, and in 2001 the majority of the churchyard dry-stone wall was removed and rebuilt.

====Sundial====
The church contains a stone sundial, dated 1689, which was originally set up by Lady Probert of the Argoed, Penallt. Three of the four faces of the sundial show the village&#x27;s historic features: Tump Terret, with the inscriptions MAGNA MOLE (&quot;Great in its Mound&quot;) and O QUOT HIC SEPULTI (&quot;Oh! How many are buried here&quot;); Harold&#x27;s Stones with the inscriptions MAIOR SAXIS (&quot;Greater in its Stones&quot;) and HIC FUIT VICTOR HARALDUS (&quot;Here Harold was victorious&quot;); and the Virtuous Well, with the inscriptions MAXIMA FONTE (&quot;Greatest in its Well&quot;) and DOM. MAGD. PROBERT OSTENDIT (&quot;Lady Magdalen Probert gives proof of it&quot;). The sundial stood in a garden, on top of the inverted ancient font, until both were moved inside the church in the early 20th century. A carved wooden replica of the sundial was placed in a field south of the village in recent years.

===Harold&#x27;s Stones===

Three large monoliths of conglomerate stone, commonly referred to as &quot;puddingstone&quot;, are located in a field on the eastern side of the B4293 to the south of the village. (SO 498051) The stones, situated on publicly accessible land belonging to the Davies family of Crosshands Farm, are a scheduled ancient monument. The stones have been described as &quot;one of the more substantial megalithic monuments in Monmouthshire&quot;.

The stones are on slightly elevated ground close to running water and springs, which might be relevant to the choice of site. They are believed to date back to the Bronze Age. Such remains are rare in this part of Wales. Various local traditions are ascribed to them: that they were erected by Harold Godwinson to celebrate a victory over the Welsh in 1063; that they commemorate three chieftains who fell fighting against the Romans; or that they were flung from the Skirrid by the mythical Jack o&#x27; Kent in a trial of strength with the Devil.

The stones form an approximate line running between north-east and south-west at an azimuth of about 229°, which probably indicates the midwinter sunset, though the midsummer sunrise cannot be excluded on account of the lack of precise alignment of the stones. They have been described as &quot;the most visually impressive of the alignments in South Wales.&quot; Their location, without good views beyond the immediate surroundings, suggests that its alignment may be significant. The stones are respectively , , and high, the tallest being at the south-west; the overall length of the row is . The central stone has what are thought to be cup marks. It is supposed that the stones were dragged to the site on logs and levered into position, probably either for seasonal information or for use at religious ceremonies. Houlder (1978) speculates that they were once part of a much larger and impressive alignment, but Castleden (1992) suggests that they did not form part of a stone circle

Aubrey Burl asserts that short stone-rows of this kind were used as the ritual centres of families of &quot;perhaps ten or twenty adults and children&quot;, though the erection of large stones required the co-operation of several such families. He compared the Trellech stones to the row at Le Vieux-Moulin, Plouharnel, near Carnac, and says that &quot;Similar short rows were erected by communities in Ireland, Britain and Brittany in the centuries of the Bronze age between 1800 and 1000 BC&quot;. The source of the Trellech stones may have been the nearby Beacon Hill where there are outcrops of a similar conglomerate. A fourth stone, on nearby common land, is believed to have been destroyed in the 18th century.

=== Tump Terret and Court Farm ===
Tump Terret is situated within the grounds of Court Farm to the southwest of the church. It dates back to Norman times, as the site of a small motte and bailey castle; traces of its surrounding ditch remain. The castle was still extant in 1263, when it was mentioned in manorial documents. A local myth, commemorated on the sundial, was that it was a burial mound for those killed in actions between the forces of Harold Godwinson and the opposing Welsh. A now-vanished summer house was built by the Rumsey family on top of the mound.

Trellech Court -- now the site of the farmhouse -- was the seat of a branch of the Seymour family until it passed to John Rumsey in the early 18th century. The existing building is, according to Bradney, &quot;a building of no architectural features&quot;, and dates from around the time of Rumsey&#x27;s ownership. It was converted into a farmhouse in the later 19th century.

===The Virtuous Well===
Sometimes known as St Anne&#x27;s Well, this circular wellspring, surrounded by a stone wall and seating, is located in a field on the left of the road to Tintern, about east of the village. Local tradition is that it is the only one remaining of originally nine holy wells in Trellech. In the 17th century, it was reportedly much frequented, and reputed to cure &quot;the scurvy, colic and other distempers&quot;. Water from the well is rich in chalybeate.

It is a clootie well, where token offerings are placed around and within the well, and strips of cloth and ribbons are hung from neighbouring trees. It is also used as a wishing well. Traditionally, &quot;to make a wish one threw into the water a small metal object. Many bubbles arising from it meant a rapid granting of one&#x27;s wish, few bubbles meant that a long period of time would elapse before the wish came true and no bubbles at all meant that one&#x27;s wish had not been granted. The young maidens of Trellech anxious to know how long they had to wait until their wedding day, would drop a pebble into the water and every bubble that arose counted for one month.&quot;

==The Village Hall / The Babington Centre==
The building now known as the Trellech Village Hall, previously The Babington Centre was constructed in 1820 as a primary school. A school was first established in the village in 1591 by the epigrammatist John Owen, and a century later, in 1691, a new school was set up by the local vicar, Zachary Babington, a relative of the bishop of Llandaff, Gervase Babington. Babington established a charity to enable poor children in the village to be educated.

When Trellech Primary School moved to a new site on the north side of the village, the 1820 school building was claimed by the Diocese of Monmouth, but eventually passed to the Trellech Babington Educational Trust, a registered charity established in 1992. The Babington Centre is now the main asset owned by the Babington Educational Foundation. The Centre is a focus for many aspects of village life including film nights, concerts, educational classes and other social events.

==The Lion Inn==
Built in the late 16th century and completed in 1580, the grade II listed Lion Inn was originally a coaching inn, brew house and pig farm. Many of the original features of the brewing cellar still remain, as do a number of outhouses that were used as pigsties. The Lion Inn has won CAMRA awards for its real ales. The inn has activities including an annual beer festival, a cider and perry festival, the entering of a team in the Monmouth raft race and a Burns Night celebration. Alternate Mondays feature &#x27;Open Mic&#x27; nights.

==Notable people==
Philosopher, logician and mathematician Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) was born at Cleddon Hall, then known as &quot;Ravenscroft&quot;, the country home of his parents Lord and Lady Amberley, situated between Trellech and Llandogo.

Kate Humble, the television presenter, farms in Trellech. In 2013 Spice Girls singer Melanie Chisholm had a house in Catbrook, to the south of the village.

<text>Bobbio (Bobbiese: ; ; ) is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Piacenza in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. It is located in the Trebbia River valley southwest of the town Piacenza. There is also an abbey and a diocese of the same name.

Bobbio is the administrative center of the &quot;Unione Montana Valli Trebbia e Luretta&quot;. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==Overview==
Bobbio is located in the heart of Val Trebbia, a valley described by Ernest Hemingway as &quot;the most beautiful in the world&quot;. The town is nestled at the foot of Monte Penice, above sea level, on the left bank of the river Trebbia.

Its history is identified with the Abbey founded in 614 by St. Columbanus an Irish missionary, and as a result, it became one of the principal centres of religious culture in medieval Italy, home to a library and basilica. The possessions of the abbey in the Lombard and Carolingian eras spanned the north of Italy.
Bobbio is a coveted tourist destination known for its history of art and culture, for nature lovers, and for its ancient monuments. It has from antiquity been a crossroads between different cultures such as the Piacentine, Ligurian, Piedmontese and Pavian.

The historical centre and heart of the city has maintained the characteristics of the medieval village. One town landmark, the Ponte Vecchio, called &quot;Ponte Gobbo&quot; (Hunchback Bridge), also known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, is an ancient stone bridge of Roman origin, which crosses the river Trebbia in eleven irregular arches. The Shrine of Our Lady of Penice, located on top of Monte Penice, dominates the landscape, and is also visited in winter for its ski resorts.

Historians have speculated that Bobbio was the town in which Leonardo da Vinci completed the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.
Carla Glori in December 2011 has published her book &quot;Enigma Leonardo:decifrazioni e scoperte&quot; where the background of the portrait has been identified as the landscape of Bobbio.

==Landscape and outskirts==

Bobbio is from Piacenza and from there it can be reached by the state road &quot;n.&quot; 45, which connects Piacenza to Genova. From Pavia, the route to Bobbio is via road n. 461 and Pass Penice.

From Bobbio, the road to Piacenza is only a few minutes from &quot;Barberino Orrido,&quot; an overlook of the river Trebbia. Continuing in the same direction you enter the village of Mezzano Scotti, and a few kilometres afterwards, the little village called Perino. It is an ideal starting point for visiting the Perino Valley or the ancient characteristic villages of Aglio and Pradovera.

On the same road but in the direction of Genova and from Bobbio is San Salvatore, a little village with a wonderful view of the river&#x27;s meanderings. A few kilometres upstream is Marsaglia and Brugnello, with the ancient &quot;Church of Brugnello&quot; overlooking the river Trebbia.

From Bobbio, taking the state road n. 461 for Pavia after you reach Passo Penice (1145 m) where there is a ski resort on the top of the Monte Penice (1460 m). This is the location of the ancient &quot;Virgin Penice Sanctuary&quot; with a view of the region; a few kilometres downhill, near Ceci, is a cross country ski run.

On the other side of the river just from Bobbio is the village of Coli, situated between pinewoods and pasture fields.

==Trebbia river and valley==
The river Trebbia is the backbone of Bobbio and its surrounding territory. It springs in Liguria on Mount Prelà and flows to reach the river Po. Its waters are fresh, clean and run between stones and rocks outlining a twisting journey through overhangs and waterfalls.
The Trebbia valley is known among international scholars for its geology.

Common activities on the river include hiking, swimming, sunbathing, canoeing, canyoning and fishing. Trout, balbels and chubs can be found in the river.

The territory around Bobbio is characterized by the Apennines, which influence the climate, contributing cool air in summer and protecting the town from cold winds and fog in winter. On the surrounding mountains are find cultivated fields and pastures, and the woods are habitats for a number of critters (squirrel, dormouse, hedgehog, hare, badger, fox, wolf, wild boar, pheasant, partridge, and many birds) and where a great variety of trees and flowers grow (aromatic herbs, broom, beech, oak, pine, chestnut, spruce, larch).

==History==
Known to the ancients as Bobium or Ebovium, the town underwent many settlements from the Neolithic Age up to the contemporary one. Several archaeological finds testify to the presence of Liguri, Boii (Gauls of Celtic origin), and from the 4th century BC the Romans.

But the history of Bobbio is tied to the existence of the Abbey founded in 614 by the Irish monk Saint Columbanus (It. Colombano), who received the district from the Longobard King Agilulf.

Bobbio Abbey increased its possessions and became one of the principal seats of culture and religion of Northern Italy and a centre of learning during the Middle Ages, and was renowned for its Scriptorium and library. In the 10th century, there were 700 codices; but its decline in the 15th century led to the dispersal of the library. The monastery was officially suppressed by the French in 1803.

This monastery was in part the model for the great monastery in Umberto Eco&#x27;s 1980 novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.

In 1014 Bobbio was erected a City and Episcopal See and surrounded by city walls that form the &quot;Contea of Bobbio&quot;.

The city lay in the region of Liguria but in 1230 Piacenza conquered Bobbio and its dominion lasted until the 14th century when the Contea of Bobbio passed, first, under the rule of the Malaspina, and then under the rule of the Visconti, the dukes of Milan.

In 1387 the city passed to the Dal Verme family and formed the &quot;Contea of Bobbio and Voghera&quot;; in 1516 the area formed the &quot;Marchesate of Bobbio&quot;.

The town became part of the domains of the House of Savoy in 1748 after the Wars of Succession and formed the &quot;Province of Bobbio&quot;.

In 1796 the French arrived in Italy and only four years later Napoleon suppressed the monastery and sold its treasures.

From 1815 to 1859 Bobbio and its province were included in the Department of Genoa, then passed to Pavia and finally in 1923 to Piacenza.

On 7 July 1944, the partisan resistance in Italy conquered the town, formed the Republic of Bobbio and governed it autonomously until it was crushed by the Germans on 27 August, the same year.

The bishopric dates from 1014. On 30 September 1986, the Diocese was suppressed and merged with Archdiocese of Genoa. Since 1989, Bobbio has been united with the Diocese of Piacenza to form the Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio.

== &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; ==
Recent historical-artistic studies and confirmed scientific hypotheses have shown that the landscape that is the background to Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Mona Lisa is taken from Bobbio. 
The landscape that forms the background to the picture is that of Bobbio seen from the Malaspina Dal Verme Castle, according to the scientific researcher Carla Glori.
Furthermore, on the basis of these historical-artistic studies, she is identified as Bianca Giovanna Sforza, the girl portrayed in the painting by Leonardo da Vinci.

==Main sights==

<text>Century Media Records is a German heavy metal record label with offices in Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music for US$17 million.

==Background==
Century Media was founded by Robert Kampf and Oliver Withöft in Dortmund, Germany, in 1988 and has gone on to launch or further the careers of bands such as Grave, Samael, Tiamat, Unleashed, Asphyx, Architects, Butcher Babies, Devin Townsend, Diecast, Divine Heresy, Eyehategod, God Forbid, Iced Earth, In This Moment, Lacuna Coil, Moonspell, Nevermore, Shadows Fall, Suicide Silence, Warbringer, Winds of Plague and Skinlab. The label specializes in many different styles of heavy metal music. A number of artists listed are licensed to Century Media for the American market from labels mostly based in Europe. Century Media is also home to Arch Enemy, Napalm Death, and Queensrÿche.

Shadows Fall experienced its greatest success during its time with the label. Iconic hardcore punk band Sick of It All also resides in the Century Media family. Lacuna Coil&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;Comalies&quot;, became Century Media&#x27;s first act to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, peaking at No. 178 two years after its release. Their fourth album, &quot;Karmacode&quot;, improved on that achievement, having sold over 490,000 copies since its release, and peaking at No. 28 on the US Billboard Album Chart. It hit number one on the Top Independent Albums Chart. Shadows Fall&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;The War Within&quot;, set a new milestone for the label with a Top 20 debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and also debuted at number one on the Independent Albums chart, having sold over 300,000 copies since its release. Other notable artists on the label that have also made appearances on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 include In This Moment, Arch Enemy, Stuck Mojo, Nightrage, Behemoth, Strapping Young Lad, Suicide Silence and God Forbid. The Finnish metal band Sentenced were awarded on August 14, 2008 for their platinum &quot;Buried Alive&quot; live DVD labeled by Century Media. In April 2009, the label announced that they were extending their existing distribution deal with EMI, who had been distributing their releases in the United States since 1997, and in Europe since 2005, to include Australasia. Since being bought out by Sony Music in August 2015, the label&#x27;s releases will be distributed worldwide by Sony Music while RED will be distributing the label&#x27;s releases in the U.S.

On June 7, 2017, Century Media divested its music publishing catalogue to Reservoir Media Management.

==Another Century==
In late 2014 Robert Kampf, founder of Century Media Records, launched a new hard rock-focused label named Another Century. This label is leaning away from straight-up metal of Century Media and looking to make a name for itself as a premiere hard rock label. Kampf, who started Century Media Records back in 1988, said in a statement that it&#x27;s his, “undying love for rock” that led to the formation of the new label, and he hopes to, “develop and break the best bands in rock.”

Robert Kampf was quoted on his new label: &quot;Twenty five years after starting Century Media the excitement to do another version of the label could not be any larger. My undying love for rock has driven the formation of this label ANOTHER CENTURY. Over the years great bands like Otherwise and In This Moment have been released on Century Media but sometimes got lost or felt ill mixed among some of the heavier CM bands. Another Century now has a clear path and mission statement: To develop and break the best bands in rock to come!&quot;

The label has since acquired breakout bands New Years Day, XO Stereo, Like a Storm, Awaken the Empire, and Stitched Up Heart.

Adrenaline Mob and Fozzy, both of whom have released albums on Century Media, are listed on the Artists page of the new Another Century website.

==Century Black==
In the mid to late 1990s, Century Media launched an imprint called Century Black, often described as &quot;the Miramax Films of black metal&quot;, releasing or re-releasing hard-to-find black metal albums from foreign bands, which normally would have been nearly impossible to find in America. Usually, those records had been released by smaller European labels, such as Malicious Records or Candlelight Records. Century Black was founded by Rayshele Teige, who also acted as A&amp;R for Century Black and had been a publicist for Century Media Records. Teige was also in charge of the American distribution arm for Osmose Productions and later went on to spearhead the American office for Prophecy Productions. By 2000, the Century Black imprint was discontinued as several of its bands had signed with other American metal record labels, or had signed deals with Century Media Records and became part of the &quot;Century Family&quot;.

==Abacus Recordings==
Abacus Recordings was an imprint of Century Media created in 2002, signing mostly metalcore bands. On July 24, 2007, it was reported that Abacus Recordings had been absorbed into Century Media, who had previously distributed Abacus&#x27; releases.

==Spotify controversy==
In August 2011, Century Media decided to pull all of their acts from Spotify, an online music streaming service, citing this as &quot;an attempt to protect the interests of their artists&quot;. Metal blog MetalSucks criticized Century Media in a post, which was later replied to by the label in an email. On July 30, 2012, Century Media Records made their entire catalog available on Spotify again after &quot;impressive debates and messages from fans&quot; and discussions with Spotify.

==Death of Oliver Withöft==
On January 21, 2014, it was reported that co-owner Oliver Withöft had died after a long period of illness. Tributes were paid to him by Monte Conner, head of US A&amp;R for Nuclear Blast Records, Nachtmystium&#x27;s Blake Judd and Sumerian Records publicist George Vallee (a former employee of Century Media), among others.

<doc id="325708" wikidata="Q212056" url="?curid=325708" title="Mongolian People's Republic">
<text>The Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (MPR) was a socialist state that existed from 1924 to 1992, located in the historical region of Outer Mongolia. Its independence was officially recognized by the Nationalist government of China in 1946. Until 1990, it was a one-party state ruled by the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, and maintained close political and economic ties with the Soviet Union, as part of the Eastern Bloc.

Outer Mongolia gained independence from Qing China in 1911, and enjoyed brief autonomy before it was seized by the Beiyang government of China in 1919. After a Soviet-backed revolution in 1921, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was established in 1924. It was led from 1939 to 1952 by Khorloogiin Choibalsan, who carried out Stalinist purges in the country, and from 1952 to 1984 by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, who allied with the Soviets during the 1960s Sino-Soviet split. In 1990, protests for democracy resulted in reforms, establishing a multi-party system, market economy, and a new constitution in 1992, ending the socialist republic.

== History ==

From 1691, the Mongols were ruled by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty of China, during which northern and southern Mongolia became known as Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, respectively. The Qing dynasty promoted Tibetan Buddhism and built monasteries, which grew rich and powerful. Its administrators also impoverished and oppressed the Mongols, and pursued colonization of Inner Mongolia in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the implementation of the New Policies, aimed at further Qing integration of Outer Mongolia, led to anti-Manchu mutinies and uprisings. In late 1911, the Qing dynasty collapsed in the Xinhai Revolution, and Outer Mongolia declared its independence under the leadership of the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was named the Bogd Khan. The new state called on the Mongols of Inner Mongolia to join it, and sought international recognition. In 1912, it signed a treaty with the Russian Empire. Under the Treaty of Kyakhta of 1915, Mongolia accepted autonomy under the suzerainty of the Republic of China (ROC).

=== Revolution and early years ===
After the 1917 October Revolution and outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Mongolia was recognized by the Bolshevik government in August 1919. That November, ROC troops entered the capital and overthrew the Bogd Khan. During the Chinese occupation, Mongolian revolutionaries made contact with the Bolsheviks in Siberia, and in 1920 founded the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (MPP), led by Damdin Sükhbaatar, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Dogsomyn Bodoo, Soliin Danzan, and others, across the border at Kyakhta. In October, White Russian cavalry under Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg entered Mongolia, and in February 1921 drove out the Chinese and restored the Bogd Khan. The MPP made a provisional government at its first congress on 1 March, and that July cavalry under Sükhbaatar, supported by Soviet troops, captured the capital in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolution. Bodoo was appointed prime minister, while the Bogd Khan was allowed to remain on the throne. In November, a Mongolian delegation traveled to Soviet Russia and signed a treaty.

A split began to emerge between nationalists and communists in the MPP, whose members included lamas and nobles. In 1922, Bodoo was executed as a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. After Sükhbaatar&#x27;s death in 1923, the MPP program was amended so the party could be &quot;purged of oppressor class elements&quot;; after the Bogd Khan&#x27;s death in 1924, the search for a new incarnation was forbidden. Danzan was executed for &quot;bourgeois tendencies&quot; that year. The MPP declared a socialist &quot;non-capitalist path of development&quot;, was renamed the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP), and joined the Comintern. The 1924 constitution founded the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (MPR), and its capital was renamed Ulaanbaatar (meaning &quot;red hero&quot;).
As in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, Mongolian politics went through several abrupt changes of direction in the 1920s and 1930s. The initial nationalist leadership of the MPRP advanced the slogan &quot;Get rich!&quot; to promote business, which was opposed by the communists. The Fifth Congress in 1926 called for restriction and nationalization of private property. The Seventh Congress in 1928 denounced previous &quot;right opportunism&quot; (&quot;baruun opportunizm&quot;) and dismissed several leaders. In 1929, the state began expropriating monastery property and tried to force herdsmen into collective farms and communes. During 1930–1932, there were uprisings led by the lamas of several monasteries, the largest of which took place in 1932 and was brutally suppressed, and herdsmen began to slaughter their livestock or herd their animals across the border. At the direction of the Comintern, the MPRP expelled the perpetrators of the &quot;left deviation&quot; (&quot;züünii nugalaa&quot;) in 1932, and a &quot;new turn&quot; (&quot;shine ergelt&quot;) was taken by moderate leadership. Collectivization of livestock herders was completed in the 1950s (see ).

From September 1937 to April 1939, Stalinist purges in Mongolia saw mass arrests of top party and state leaders, lamas, soldiers, and citizens on false charges of &quot;counter-revolution&quot; and spying for Japan. Some 20,000 to 35,000 Mongols were executed in Mongolia and the USSR in a campaign organized by NKVD officials and Khorloogiin Choibalsan, minister of internal affairs and commander-in-chief. Under communist repression, an estimated 17,000 monks were killed, official figures show. Prime Ministers Peljidiin Genden and Anandyn Amar, for example, were accused of counter-revolution and shot in Moscow in 1937 and 1941, respectively. Buddhist institutions were nearly all destroyed, their property appropriated, and the lamas killed or secularized. In March 1939, Choibalsan, Stalin&#x27;s close ally, became prime minister of Mongolia and led a Stalinist dictatorship, and initiated further episodes of repression during his tenure.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===

In 1931–1932, the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria and set up the puppet state of Manchukuo. In 1934, Mongolia and the USSR made a verbal agreement on mutual aid in case of invasion, followed by a formal agreement in 1936. In May 1939, Japanese forces first skirmished with Soviet and Mongolian troops at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. That July, Japan launched an unsuccessful attack across the river, and in August, Soviet and Mongolian troops under General (later Marshal) Georgy Zhukov, encircled and destroyed the Japanese forces. In April 1941, the USSR and Japan concluded a neutrality pact. That June, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Mongolia did not join the war directly, but provided the Soviets with volunteers and materiel, and the country&#x27;s economy was marshalled to support the war effort. Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, MPRP general secretary and second to Choibalsan, rose to prominence, inspecting aid deliveries and touring the Eastern Front as a Mongolian People&#x27;s Army (MPA) lieutenant general.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the &quot;Big Three&quot; Allied powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union) decided the terms of the planned Soviet entry into the war against Japan, which included a recognition of the &quot;status quo&quot; in Mongolia (which was still internationally recognized as part of China). In August 1945, the Soviet Union used Mongolia as one base for its Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. The build-up brought 650,000 Soviet troops and large amounts of equipment to the country; the MPA played a limited role. The ROC, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, was persuaded to recognize Mongolian independence in the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty after Stalin promised to refrain from supporting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Chinese Civil War. In keeping with the treaty, a successful independence referendum was held in Mongolia in October 1945.

=== Cold War politics (1945–1984) ===

Following the CCP&#x27;s victory in the Chinese Civil War and its proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, Mongolia transferred its recognition from the ROC to the PRC. The 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty guaranteed Outer Mongolia&#x27;s independence, but ended Choibalsan&#x27;s hopes for reuniting it with Inner Mongolia. Mao Zedong privately hoped for Outer Mongolia&#x27;s reintegration with China, and he was rebuffed by Soviet leadership after raising the question in 1949 and again in 1954, the year after Stalin&#x27;s death. In 1956, after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin, Chinese leaders attempted to present Mongolia&#x27;s independence as one of Stalin&#x27;s mistakes. The Soviet response was that the Mongols were free to decide their own fate. Choibalsan died of cancer in Moscow in 1952, and was replaced as prime minister by Tsedenbal. Unlike his predecessor, Tsedenbal was enthusiastic about incorporating Mongolia as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. This proposal was met with strenuous opposition from other MPRP members, and was subsequently abandoned.

Mongolia&#x27;s foreign relations outside of the USSR and PRC were initially limited to the Soviet satellites of the Eastern Bloc. It was recognized by India in 1955, and that year attempted to join the United Nations (UN), but its request was vetoed by the ROC (now based in Taiwan) which had withdrawn its recognition of Mongolia&#x27;s independence and renewed its territorial claim on the country. Mongolia eventually became a member state of the UN in 1961, after the Soviet Union threatened to veto the admission of the newly decolonized states of Africa if the ROC again used its veto. Mongolia established diplomatic relations with its first Western country, the United Kingdom, in 1963, but its diplomatic relations with the United States were not established until 1987, near the end of the Cold War.

In the 1950s, relations between the MPR and the PRC improved considerably. The Trans-Mongolian Railway, which opened in 1949 and linked Moscow with Ulaanbaatar via the Trans-Siberian Railway, was extended to the Chinese border and linked with Beijing in 1955. China provided economic support to Mongolia by building factories and apartment blocks, and thousands of Chinese laborers were involved in the projects until they were withdrawn in 1962 in an unsuccessful bid to pressure Mongolia to break with the USSR during the Sino-Soviet split. A military build-up on the Sino-Mongolian border began in 1963, and in 1966 the Soviet Union and Mongolia signed a new mutual aid treaty with a secret annex allowing the stationing of Soviet troops and missiles in the country. The Soviet Union increased its investment in the Mongolian economy on a &quot;fraternal&quot; or &quot;elder brother–younger brother&quot; (&quot;akh düü&quot;) basis.

Tsedenbal, a friend of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, sent many of his political rivals into internal exile during his leadership, including Dashiin Damba in 1959, Daramyn Tömör-Ochir in 1962, Tsogt-Ochiryn Lookhuuz and others in 1964, Bazaryn Shirendev in 1982, and Sampilyn Jalan-Aajav in 1983. After Jamsrangiin Sambuu&#x27;s death, Tsedenbal was elected in his place as chairman of the presidium of the People&#x27;s Great Khural (head of state) in 1974, and handed the premiership to Jambyn Batmönkh. Tsedenbal was expelled from office by Batmönkh and the MPRP Politburo in August 1984, on the pretext of &quot;old age and mental incapacity&quot; in a move with full Soviet backing, and he retired to Moscow; Batmönkh took over as the party leader and head of state.

=== Reforms and end (1984–1992) ===
After Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in March 1985, he began implementing policies of &quot;perestroika&quot; (restructuring the economy) and &quot;glasnost&quot; (openness and accountability); the atmosphere of reform prompted the same policies in Mongolia, known as &quot;öörchlön baiguulalt&quot; and &quot;il tod&quot;. Unlike Tsedenbal, Batmönkh agreed with the Soviet leadership on normalizing Sino-Soviet relations; between 1987 and 1992, Soviet troops were withdrawn from Mongolia, which enabled both countries to normalize relations with China. In 1988, the MPRP newspaper &quot;Ünen&quot; urged accelerated reforms to overcome the party&#x27;s &quot;dogmatic interpretation of socialism&quot;, declared that &quot;authoritarianism and intellectual indolence&quot; undermined national &quot;renewal&quot;, and described Tsedenbal as &quot;willful and unprincipled&quot;. In that same year, Mongolia participated in the Seoul Olympic Games, making its final appearance as a communist nation. In 1989, Mongolian newspapers called for an &quot;objective and realistic evaluation&quot; of Mongolian–Soviet relations. 

On 10 December 1989 (Human Rights Day), young people began demonstrating for political freedom in Ulaanbaatar. In January 1990, anti-MPRP rallies were held by student and social democratic organizations; their spokesman was Sanjaasürengiin Zorig. After more demonstrations and a hunger strike, the MPRP leadership resigned in March, and Batmönkh was replaced as head of state and general secretary. Tsedenbal was expelled from the MPRP. In May, the constitution was amended by the People&#x27;s Great Khural, which deleted references to the MPRP&#x27;s &quot;guiding role&quot; in society, legalized opposition parties, and established the office of president and a standing legislature (the State Little Khural). At Mongolia&#x27;s first multiparty elections in July, the MPRP gained majorities in both bodies. A transition to a market economy was approved, and the herding cooperatives and state farms were broken up and privatized. A new constitution, adopted in January 1992 and entering into force in February, created a unicameral State Great Khural and ended the socialist republic.

== Government and politics ==
From 1924 to 1990, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was a one-party state ruled by the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP). While formally a democratic republic with regular elections, in reality, its elections were pre-decided and its government alternated between oligarchy and one-man rule.

Before 1928, the leader of the MPRP was the chairman (&quot;darga&quot;) of its Central Committee (&quot;töv khoroo&quot;), which had a presidium (&quot;tergüülegchid&quot;) of about 10 members representing the core party leadership. Between 1928 and 1940, the Comintern replaced the chairman with three co-secretaries to weaken the party&#x27;s ability to resist its directives. In 1940, the presidium was replaced by a political bureau (Politburo; &quot;uls töriin tovchoo&quot;), headed by a general secretary (&quot;yerönkhii nariin bichgiin darga&quot;); the title of the position was &quot;first secretary&quot; (&quot;negdügeer nariin bichgiin darga&quot;) from 1954 to 1981. Until 1974, the maximum leader of Mongolia was the head of government as the chairman of the council of ministers (&quot;said naryn zövlöl&quot;), equivalent to a prime minister. The council oversaw cabinet-level ministries, which numbered 42 by 1981. Before it was abolished in 1951, the Little Khural, a presidium of five members (from 1927, three) was elected by the Great Khural to select the premier; its chairman was the head of state. Thereafter, the chairman of the eight-member presidium of the (People&#x27;s) Great Khural became the head of state. From 1974 to 1990, the maximum leader held this position and that of party general secretary.

The Central Committee was responsible for supervising party affairs and making important policy decisions, including the appointment and removal of party and government leaders. Most of its work was done at plenary meetings, typically held twice a year. The Central Committee&#x27;s membership numbered 83 in 1971, 91 in 1976 and 1981, and 85 in 1986 (in addition to 55, 61, 71, and 65 non-voting candidate members in the same years). Its members were elected at party congresses; the first congress was held in 1921 and followed by one every year from 1923 to 1928, involving relatively frank debate. From 1930 to 1960, only six congresses were held (in 1930, 1934, 1940, 1947, 1954, and 1958), ratifying key decisions which had been made in advance. From 1961 to 1986, the congresses were purely symbolic events, held every five years to coincide with those of the Soviet Union and the creation of five-year plans. The next MPRP congress was due for 1991, but the protests of 1990 forced an extraordinary congress in April 1990, which claimed a membership of 94,750.

From 1990 to 1992, the head of government was a prime minister (&quot;yerönkhii said&quot;) and the head of state was a president (&quot;yerönkhiilögch&quot;), elected indirectly by the People&#x27;s Great Khural. The People&#x27;s Great Khural also elected the 50-member State Little Khural, whose seat apportionment reflected proportional representation of the total ballot for parties in the legislative election; three-quarters of its members were required to be People&#x27;s Great Khural deputies. 

=== Constitutions ===

Mongolia&#x27;s first-ever constitution, adopted by the first Great Khural in November 1924, proclaimed the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and the transfer of political power to the working people along Marxist–Leninist lines. The land, water, and mineral wealth of the country were nationalized. The constitution contained a declaration of the rights of the people, equality before the law, and suffrage at age 18 (with the exception of &quot;feudalists&quot; and Buddhist lamas resident in the monasteries). The &quot;soyombo&quot; symbol of Mongolian independence was adopted as the state arms.

The second constitution, adopted by the eighth Great Khural in June–July 1940, was closely modeled on the 1936 Soviet constitution. It proclaimed a state of &quot;herdsmen, workers, and intelligentsia&quot; taking a &quot;non-capitalist road of development for the future transition to socialism&quot;. It added &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; to the list of disenfranchised, and declared the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party to be the &quot;vanguard of the working people and core of all their organizations&quot;. New state arms depicted a herdsman on horseback and the heads of a cow, sheep, goat, and camel. Amendments adopted by the ninth Great Khural in February 1949 introduced electoral reform, including a secret ballot, universal suffrage, and direct elections. In 1951, the Little Khural was abolished and the Great Khurals were renumbered. In 1956, the Council of Ministers was restructured.

The third constitution, adopted by the fourth Great Khural in July 1960, proclaimed a state of &quot;workers, collectivized herdsmen, and working intelligentsia&quot; which sought to achieve the &quot;building of socialism and in the future build a communist society&quot;; the preamble declared the MPRP the &quot;guiding and directing force of society and the state&quot;. The Great Khural was renamed the People&#x27;s Great Khural. New state arms replaced the four animal heads with a cogwheel and ears of wheat. Amendments adopted by the 11th People&#x27;s Great Khural in March and May 1990 removed references to the MPRP&#x27;s &quot;guiding&quot; role from the preamble, instituted a presidency, and established the State Little Khural (a standing legislature). The 1992 constitution ended the socialist republic.

== Economy ==
At the MPR&#x27;s foundation in 1924, Mongolia was a nomadic subsistence society. Farming and industry were almost nonexistent, and transportation and communications were primitive. Most people were illiterate nomadic herders, and a large part of the male labor force lived in the monasteries, contributing little to the economy. Property in the form of livestock was primarily owned by aristocrats and the monasteries; ownership of the remaining sectors of the economy was dominated by Chinese and other foreigners. The MPR was thus faced with the daunting task of building a modern economy. Socialist collectivization, industrialization, and urbanization ultimately transformed the agrarian, nomadic economy of the 1920s into a developing, agricultural-industrial economy by the late 1980s.

=== Collective farming ===
The first attempt to collectivize livestock herding began in 1929. By the end of 1930, nearly 30 percent of all poor and middle herdsmen&#x27;s households had been forced to join collective farms (&quot;khamtral&quot;) or communes (&quot;kommun&quot;). After uprisings, these collectives were disbanded in 1932 and replaced by voluntary cooperatives (&quot;nökhörlöl&quot;) and production associations (&quot;negdel&quot;), of which there were 91 in 1940. Collectivization was achieved in the 1950s; the number of &quot;negdel&quot;, which were run by member councils, rose from 165 in 1952 to a peak of 727 in 1958, comprising 108,200 households (75 percent of the total). The number of livestock owned by &quot;negdel&quot; rose from 280,500 in 1952 to 16.9 million in 1960, by which the number of &quot;negdel&quot; had decreased to 354 after consolidation. In the 1950s, the &quot;sum&quot; (rural districts) and &quot;negdel&quot; were combined into &quot;sum-negdel&quot;, and the positions of head of the &quot;sum&quot; administration and chairman of the &quot;negdel&quot; council were merged. The national Union of Production Associations was founded in 1967 to regulate &quot;negdel&quot; membership.

The first state farms (&quot;sangiin aj akhui&quot;) were established in 1922–1923, and numbered 10 in 1940. Their numbers increased rapidly with the development of large-scale grain and vegetable farming and the introduction of industrialized methods in the 1970s and 1980s, rising to 25 by 1960 and to 52 by 1985. In 1990, there were 53 state farms and 20 specialized fodder farms (&quot;tejeeliin aj akhui&quot;), with a total of 35,200 workers. They were concentrated in the central and northern regions of the country, where natural conditions were suitable. An average state farm in 1985 had 15,400 hectares of arable land, 92 tractors, 36 grain harvesters, 26,200 head of livestock, and 500 workers. In 1990, the state farms owned 5.1 percent of the country&#x27;s livestock (1.32 million head)&quot;.&quot;

=== Industry and urbanization ===
After a failed attempt in 1931–1935, the government launched eight five-year plans (and one three-year plan) in the period between 1948 and 1990, with the goal of rapidly developing agriculture and industry: 1948–1952 (first), 1953–1957 (second), 1958–1960 (the three-year plan); 1961–1965 (third), 1966–1970 (fourth), 1971–1975 (fifth); 1976–1980 (sixth), 1981–1985 (seventh), and 1986–1990 (eighth). Mongolia first attended a meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1958 as an observer, and became a member in June 1962. It received large amounts of economic, financial, and technical assistance through the council from the USSR and Eastern Europe, in the forms of credits, advisers, and joint ventures.

In 1961, the manufacturing town of Darkhan was founded on the Trans-Mongolian Railway, north of Ulaanbaatar. In 1973, Erdenet was founded on a branch railway west of Darkhan to host the Erdenet Mining Corporation, a joint Mongolian–Soviet enterprise and one of the world&#x27;s largest copper mines. Both towns, which are today Mongolia&#x27;s second and third largest, were built in previously uninhabited areas and gained modern power stations, high-rise housing, schools, hospitals, and shops. Industrial development of cities was paralleled by small-scale urbanization of rural communities. Some 300 small permanent settlements were built with a school, clinic, shop, administrative office, police station, and electricity.

Mongolia has industrial reserves of coal, copper, fluorite, and iron ore as well as numerous deposits of gold, silver, zinc, lead, tin, tungsten, and other precious and rare metals. The first modern coal mine was built at Nalaikh, near Ulaanbaatar, in the 1930s and linked to the capital by a narrow-gauge railway line. The development of large-scale open-pit mining at Sharyngol near Darkhan and Baganuur, east of Ulaanbaatar, made the Nalaikh mine obsolete. Mongolia had no manufacturing industries before the building of the Ulaanbaatar industrial combine in the 1930s; there were no large-scale developments until the building of Darkhan and Erdenet in the 1960s and 1970s, which was accompanied by efforts to modernize provincial towns such as Choibalsan and Sükhbaatar. The main industries were mining, electricity generation, production of building materials, and processing of livestock produce (meat, wool, and hides) into semi-finished goods, foodstuffs, and consumer goods.

Industry accounted for 7 percent of Mongolia&#x27;s net material product (NMP) in 1950 and increased to 35 percent in 1985. Trade increased from 10 percent to 26 percent; agriculture, including herding, declined from 68 percent to 20 percent. In 1960, 61 percent of the employed worked in the agricultural sector, decreasing to 33 percent by 1985. GDP figures for Mongolia record growth throughout the 1980s; as late as 1988, the annual increase in GDP amounted to 5.1 percent. In the late 1980s, the stagnation of the economy and the example of &quot;perestroika&quot; in the Soviet Union led Mongolian leaders to undertake a program of reform which developed the economy in a market direction, which ultimately led to the end of the socialist republic and the turn to capitalism.

=== Banking and trade ===
The national Bank of Mongolia (Mongolbank) was founded in June 1924 as the Mongolian Trade and Industry Bank, which held &quot;yanchaan&quot; (silver dollars). In December 1925, it began issuing Mongolia&#x27;s own currency, the &quot;tögrög&quot; (&#x27;round&#x27;), in silver coins of one &quot;tögrög&quot; subdivided into &quot;möngö&quot;. It became the sole legal currency in 1928. The bank was transferred to the Mongolian government in 1935, and renamed the State Bank of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic in 1954. Circulation of the &quot;tögrög&quot; was strictly controlled by the MPR government with Soviet backing, and its foreign exchange rate was artificially fixed. In the 1960s, for example, it was valued by the State Bank at a rate of 1 USD to 4 &quot;tögrög&quot;. In the 1920s, the Mongolian government drove foreign merchants out of the country and introduced a foreign trade monopoly. Mongolia traded only with the USSR until the establishment of relations with China after World War II, which ceased after the 1960s Sino-Soviet split. Comecon membership enabled import of machinery and vehicles from Eastern Europe in exchange for raw materials, though some 85 percent of trade remained with the USSR. In the 1980s, 1 to 2 percent of trade was opened with Western countries; the value of imports far exceeded that of exports, and the imbalance was funded by long-term loans from the USSR, estimated at 10 billion rubles by 1990.

== Society ==

=== Education ===
Before the 1921 revolution, religious schools in monasteries taught lamas to read Buddhist scriptures in Tibetan and Mongol, and the few secular schools trained clerks for local administration. The first government-run primary school was opened in the capital in November 1921, followed by the first secondary school in 1923. The Ministry of Education was established in 1924, and devised a 10-year plan (1926–1936) for the development of education and teacher training. Buryat intellectual Erdene Batkhaan, minister of education in 1926–1929, played a key role. A nationwide cultural offensive was declared in 1930–1931 following the government&#x27;s decision to adopt the Latin script for Mongolian and eradicate adult illiteracy; adoption of the Cyrillic script was decreed in March 1941, but only came into general use from January 1946. Starting in 1937, increasing numbers of Mongolian students were sent to the Soviet Union for training in vocational schools; Mongolia&#x27;s first vocational school opened in 1938. Higher education in Mongolia began with the opening of the Mongolian State University in 1942. The number of general education schools rose from 331 with 24,000 pupils in 1940, to 359 with 50,000 pupils in 1947. Obligatory eight-year general education (ages eight to 16) was introduced gradually in the 1970s. In 1980, the 113 elementary schools taught grades one to four, 150 &quot;incomplete&quot; secondary education schools for grades one to nine, and 108 (267 by 1990) &quot;complete&quot; secondary education schools for grades one to 11.

=== Healthcare ===
Before the 1920s, Mongolia had no health services apart from what was provided by lamas or shamans, who offered a combination of herbal remedies and incantations, and the population was in decline from untreated sickness. Modern healthcare in Mongolia was developed starting in 1922 under the Soviet Semashko model, with the construction of a large hospital and clinical network and training of staff in Western medicine. The isolation of the country meant that developments in medicine were slow to reach it, though population decline was gradually reversed by the 1930s. The ratio of doctors to the general population increased dramatically; in 1990, there were more than 6,000 physicians, three-quarters of whom were women. The medical care system was accessible at little or no cost even in the most remote areas. State-sponsored maternity rest homes for pastoral women in the final stages of pregnancy helped to lower infant mortality from 109 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 57.4 in 1990, and maternal mortality by about 25 percent from 1960 to 1990.

=== Media and arts ===

Under the one-party rule of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, media in Mongolia was strictly controlled. The main source of information was the state-owned Montsame news agency. The official MPRP newspaper &quot;Ünen&quot; (&#x27;Truth&#x27;), founded in 1920 and still published today, served as a mouthpiece of the People&#x27;s Great Khural, Council of Ministers, and MPRP Central Committee. The party also published the monthly journal &quot;Namyn Amidral&quot; (&#x27;Party Life&#x27;), which discussed theoretical matters. Other official publications included the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League newspaper &quot;Zaluuchuudyn Ünen&quot; (&#x27;Youth Truth&#x27;) and the cultural paper &quot;Utga Zokhiol Urlag&quot; (&#x27;Literature and Art&#x27;), which dispensed ideological guidance. Mongolradio was established in 1933, and Mongolteleviz in 1967.

Under political pressure, traditional Mongolian arts were suppressed in favor of Soviet-inspired &quot;socialist realism&quot;. Much of traditional culture was viewed as &quot;feudal&quot; or &quot;religious&quot;, and was officially abandoned in favor of artworks depicting revolutionary heroism, intended to mold the &quot;new man&quot; of the socialist society. The MPRP established systematic censorship of press, publications, and artistic performance. However, there was disagreement and lack of clear direction, reflected in particular by the fluctuating political attitudes toward Mongolia&#x27;s greatest hero, Genghis Khan. Common subjects of &quot;socialist realism&quot; included heroic shepherds and workers, and figures from history such as Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan (a prominent example being the monumental equestrian statue of Sükhbaatar which today stands in the center of Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s Sükhbaatar Square). Some painters combined realism and &quot;mongol zurag&quot;, a style developed in the early 20th century. &quot;Bypassing Capitalism&quot;, a design depicting a Mongol rider jumping from feudalism to socialism, was reproduced in murals and as a stamp design. 

The most prominent figure to emerge in modern Mongolian poetry and literature was Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj, whose opera &quot;Uchirtai gurvan tolgoi&quot; (&quot;Three Sad Hills&quot;) remains popular today&quot;.&quot; The national theater was established in 1931, represented by such playwrights as Sodnombaljiryn Buyannemekh and Donrovyn Namdag. Mongolia&#x27;s first film studio, set up with Soviet aid in 1935, produced the drama &quot;Norjmaa&#x27;s Destiny&quot; in 1938 but generally concentrated on full-length feature films about heroes from Mongolian history. There were co-productions with Soviet filmmakers, such as &quot;Son of Mongolia&quot; (1936), as well as film versions of classics such as &quot;Transparent Tamir&quot; by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba, released as a trilogy in 1970–1973. The first Mongolian ballet, &quot;Path of Happiness&quot; by Bilegiin Damdinsüren, was staged in 1950. Traditional arts were best preserved as epic poetry, music, and song, which had been passed down by bards and storytellers and first recorded (in printed word and sound) in the 20th century. The state folk song and dance ensemble was established in 1961. Under Soviet influence, European instruments were introduced, foreign works were performed, and Mongolian composers began to write music for orchestras and brass bands. The first full-scale symphonic work, &quot;My Homeland&quot;, was composed in 1955 by Luvsanjambyn Mördorj. The National Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1957. The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of Soviet-style dance bands and popular music groups.

=== Science ===
In November 1921, Buryat scholar Tsyben Zhamtsarano founded the Committee of Scriptures and Manuscripts, which established national archives in 1927. In 1931, the institute was renamed the Committee of Sciences, and began to undertake studies in botany, agriculture, geography, geology, and mapmaking. Further research institutes were linked either to the government (building, education, health, and communications) or universities (physics, mathematics, biology, and the social sciences). The Institute of Party History supervised the writing of the history of the MPRP and the translation of Marxist–Leninist classics. There was close cooperation with the Soviet Academy of Sciences, whose Mongolian Commission supervised Soviet research on Mongolia. In 1961, the Mongolian Academy of Sciences was founded. Scientific cooperation with the Eastern Bloc was coordinated by Comecon.

== Military ==
The Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army was founded in 1921 as a partisan force against Chinese occupation. It primarily consisted of cavalry under its commander, Damdin Sükhbaatar. With Soviet technical aid and training, it received weapons, motor vehicles, communications equipment, and aircraft. Mongolian and Soviet troops clashed with Japanese forces in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol on Mongolia&#x27;s eastern border in 1939, and jointly participated in the invasion of Manchuria in northern China in 1945, in which Mongolia was an important base. In the Beitashan Incident in 1947, Republic of China cavalry fought Mongolian and Soviet troops on the border with Xinjiang. The army was renamed the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army in 1955. During the 1970s and 1980s, Mongolia received modern equipment, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, heavy and anti-aircraft artillery, radar, attack helicopters, and jet fighters. The Mongolian Air Force, founded in 1925, initially ran the civil airline MIAT, established in 1956. 

Mongolian army ranks and uniform were similar to their Soviet counterparts. As in the Soviet military, there was an army political directorate and deputy political commissars, whose function was to ensure loyalty to the MPRP. The army maintained close ties with Soviet GRU military intelligence and NKVD secret police; Mongolia&#x27;s Interior Ministry secret police and Buryat Mongol Comintern agents assisted in its administration under direct Soviet guidance.

<doc id="325714" wikidata="Q1627597" url="?curid=325714" title="Hopf algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a Hopf algebra, named after Heinz Hopf, is a structure that is simultaneously a (unital associative) algebra and a (counital coassociative) coalgebra, with these structures&#x27; compatibility making it a bialgebra, and that moreover is equipped with an antihomomorphism satisfying a certain property. The representation theory of a Hopf algebra is particularly nice, since the existence of compatible comultiplication, counit, and antipode allows for the construction of tensor products of representations, trivial representations, and dual representations.

Hopf algebras occur naturally in algebraic topology, where they originated and are related to the H-space concept, in group scheme theory, in group theory (via the concept of a group ring), and in numerous other places, making them probably the most familiar type of bialgebra. Hopf algebras are also studied in their own right, with much work on specific classes of examples on the one hand and classification problems on the other. They have diverse applications ranging from condensed matter physics and quantum field theory to string theory and LHC phenomenology.

==Formal definition==
Formally, a Hopf algebra is an (associative and coassociative) bialgebra &quot;H&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; together with a &quot;K&quot;-linear map &quot;S&quot;: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot; (called the antipode) such that the following diagram commutes:

Here Δ is the comultiplication of the bialgebra, ∇ its multiplication, η its unit and ε its counit. In the sumless Sweedler notation, this property can also be expressed as
:formula_1

As for algebras, one can replace the underlying field &quot;K&quot; with a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; in the above definition.

The definition of Hopf algebra is self-dual (as reflected in the symmetry of the above diagram), so if one can define a dual of &quot;H&quot; (which is always possible if &quot;H&quot; is finite-dimensional), then it is automatically a Hopf algebra.

=== Structure constants ===
Fixing a basis formula_2 for the underlying vector space, one may define the algebra in terms of structure constants for multiplication:
:formula_3
for co-multiplication:
:formula_4
and the antipode:
:formula_5
Associativity then requires that
:formula_6
while co-associativity requires that
:formula_7
The connecting axiom requires that
:formula_8

===Properties of the antipode===
The antipode &quot;S&quot; is sometimes required to have a &quot;K&quot;-linear inverse, which is automatic in the finite-dimensional case, or if &quot;H&quot; is commutative or cocommutative (or more generally quasitriangular).

In general, &quot;S&quot; is an antihomomorphism, so &quot;S&quot;2 is a homomorphism, which is therefore an automorphism if &quot;S&quot; was invertible (as may be required).

If &quot;S&quot;2 = id&quot;H&quot;, then the Hopf algebra is said to be involutive (and the underlying algebra with involution is a *-algebra). If &quot;H&quot; is finite-dimensional semisimple over a field of characteristic zero, commutative, or cocommutative, then it is involutive.

If a bialgebra &quot;B&quot; admits an antipode &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is unique (&quot;a bialgebra admits at most 1 Hopf algebra structure&quot;). Thus, the antipode does not pose any extra structure which we can choose: Being a Hopf algebra is a property of a bialgebra.

The antipode is an analog to the inversion map on a group that sends &quot;g&quot; to &quot;g&quot;−1.

===Hopf subalgebras===
A subalgebra &quot;A&quot; of a Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; is a Hopf subalgebra if it is a subcoalgebra of &quot;H&quot; and the antipode &quot;S&quot; maps &quot;A&quot; into &quot;A&quot;. In other words, a Hopf subalgebra A is a Hopf algebra in its own right when the multiplication, comultiplication, counit and antipode of &quot;H&quot; are restricted to &quot;A&quot; (and additionally the identity 1 of &quot;H&quot; is required to be in A). The Nichols–Zoeller freeness theorem of Warren Nichols and Bettina Zoeller (1989) established that the natural &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;H&quot; is free of finite rank if &quot;H&quot; is finite-dimensional: a generalization of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem for subgroups. As a corollary of this and integral theory, a Hopf subalgebra of a semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is automatically semisimple.

A Hopf subalgebra &quot;A&quot; is said to be right normal in a Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; if it satisfies the condition of stability, &quot;adr&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)(&quot;A&quot;) ⊆ &quot;A&quot; for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, where the right adjoint mapping &quot;adr&quot; is defined by &quot;adr&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;S&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(1))&quot;ah&quot;(2) for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;. Similarly, a Hopf subalgebra &quot;A&quot; is left normal in &quot;H&quot; if it is stable under the left adjoint mapping defined by &quot;adl&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(1)&quot;aS&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(2)). The two conditions of normality are equivalent if the antipode &quot;S&quot; is bijective, in which case &quot;A&quot; is said to be a normal Hopf subalgebra.

A normal Hopf subalgebra &quot;A&quot; in &quot;H&quot; satisfies the condition (of equality of subsets of H): &quot;HA&quot;+ = &quot;A&quot;+&quot;H&quot; where &quot;A&quot;+ denotes the kernel of the counit on &quot;A&quot;. This normality condition implies that &quot;HA&quot;+ is a Hopf ideal of &quot;H&quot; (i.e. an algebra ideal in the kernel of the counit, a coalgebra coideal and stable under the antipode). As a consequence one has a quotient Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot;/&quot;HA&quot;+ and epimorphism &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot;/&quot;A&quot;+&quot;H&quot;, a theory analogous to that of normal subgroups and quotient groups in group theory.

===Hopf orders===
A Hopf order &quot;O&quot; over an integral domain &quot;R&quot; with field of fractions &quot;K&quot; is an order in a Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; over &quot;K&quot; which is closed under the algebra and coalgebra operations: in particular, the comultiplication Δ maps &quot;O&quot; to &quot;O&quot;⊗&quot;O&quot;.

===Group-like elements===
A group-like element is a nonzero element &quot;x&quot; such that Δ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;⊗&quot;x&quot;. The group-like elements form a group with inverse given by the antipode. A primitive element &quot;x&quot; satisfies Δ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;⊗1 + 1⊗&quot;x&quot;.

== Examples ==
Note that functions on a finite group can be identified with the group ring, though these are more naturally thought of as dual – the group ring consists of &quot;finite&quot; sums of elements, and thus pairs with functions on the group by evaluating the function on the summed elements.

=== Cohomology of Lie groups ===
The cohomology algebra (over a field formula_9) of a Lie group formula_10 is a Hopf algebra: the multiplication is provided by the cup product, and the comultiplication 
:formula_11
by the group multiplication formula_12. This observation was actually a source of the notion of Hopf algebra. Using this structure, Hopf proved a structure theorem for the cohomology algebra of Lie groups.

Theorem (Hopf) Let formula_13 be a finite-dimensional, graded commutative, graded cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Then formula_13 (as an algebra) is a free exterior algebra with generators of odd degree.

=== Quantum groups and non-commutative geometry ===
Most examples above are either commutative (i.e. the multiplication is commutative) or co-commutative (i.e. Δ = &quot;T&quot; ∘ Δ where the &quot;twist map&quot; &quot;T&quot;: &quot;H&quot; ⊗ &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot; ⊗ &quot;H&quot; is defined by &quot;T&quot;(&quot;x&quot; ⊗ &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; ⊗ &quot;x&quot;). Other interesting Hopf algebras are certain &quot;deformations&quot; or &quot;quantizations&quot; of those from example 3 which are neither commutative nor co-commutative. These Hopf algebras are often called &quot;quantum groups&quot;, a term that is so far only loosely defined. They are important in noncommutative geometry, the idea being the following: a standard algebraic group is well described by its standard Hopf algebra of regular functions; we can then think of the deformed version of this Hopf algebra as describing a certain &quot;non-standard&quot; or &quot;quantized&quot; algebraic group (which is not an algebraic group at all). While there does not seem to be a direct way to define or manipulate these non-standard objects, one can still work with their Hopf algebras, and indeed one &quot;identifies&quot; them with their Hopf algebras. Hence the name &quot;quantum group&quot;.

==Representation theory==
Let &quot;A&quot; be a Hopf algebra, and let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be &quot;A&quot;-modules. Then, &quot;M&quot; ⊗ &quot;N&quot; is also an &quot;A&quot;-module, with
:formula_15
for &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, &quot;n&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; and Δ(&quot;a&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2). Furthermore, we can define the trivial representation as the base field &quot;K&quot; with
:formula_16
for &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;. Finally, the dual representation of &quot;A&quot; can be defined: if &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;A&quot;-module and &quot;M*&quot; is its dual space, then
:formula_17
where &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;M*&quot; and &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;.

The relationship between Δ, ε, and &quot;S&quot; ensure that certain natural homomorphisms of vector spaces are indeed homomorphisms of &quot;A&quot;-modules. For instance, the natural isomorphisms of vector spaces &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; ⊗ &quot;K&quot; and &quot;M&quot; → &quot;K&quot; ⊗ &quot;M&quot; are also isomorphisms of &quot;A&quot;-modules. Also, the map of vector spaces &quot;M*&quot; ⊗ &quot;M&quot; → &quot;K&quot; with &quot;f&quot; ⊗ &quot;m&quot; → &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is also a homomorphism of &quot;A&quot;-modules. However, the map &quot;M&quot; ⊗ &quot;M*&quot; → &quot;K&quot; is not necessarily a homomorphism of &quot;A&quot;-modules.

== Related concepts ==
Graded Hopf algebras are often used in algebraic topology: they are the natural algebraic structure on the direct sum of all homology or cohomology groups of an H-space.

Locally compact quantum groups generalize Hopf algebras and carry a topology. The algebra of all continuous functions on a Lie group is a locally compact quantum group.

Quasi-Hopf algebras are generalizations of Hopf algebras, where coassociativity only holds up to a twist. They have been used in the study of the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations.

Multiplier Hopf algebras introduced by Alfons Van Daele in 1994 are generalizations of Hopf algebras where comultiplication from an algebra (with or without unit) to the multiplier algebra of tensor product algebra of the algebra with itself.

Hopf group-(co)algebras introduced by V. G. Turaev in 2000 are also generalizations of Hopf algebras.

===Weak Hopf algebras===
Weak Hopf algebras, or quantum groupoids, are generalizations of Hopf algebras. Like Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras form a self-dual class of algebras; i.e., if &quot;H&quot; is a (weak) Hopf algebra, so is &quot;H&quot;*, the dual space of linear forms on &quot;H&quot; (with respect to the algebra-coalgebra structure obtained from the natural pairing with &quot;H&quot; and its coalgebra-algebra structure). A weak Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; is usually taken to be a
*finite-dimensional algebra and coalgebra with coproduct Δ: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot; ⊗ &quot;H&quot; and counit ε: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;k&quot; satisfying all the axioms of Hopf algebra except possibly Δ(1) ≠ 1 ⊗ 1 or ε(&quot;ab&quot;) ≠ ε(&quot;a&quot;)ε(&quot;b&quot;) for some &quot;a,b&quot; in &quot;H&quot;. Instead one requires the following:

::formula_18
::formula_19

:for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.
* &quot;H&quot; has a weakened antipode &quot;S&quot;: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot; satisfying the axioms:

#formula_20 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot; (the right-hand side is the interesting projection usually denoted by Π&quot;R&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) or ε&quot;s&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) with image a separable subalgebra denoted by &quot;HR&quot; or &quot;Hs&quot;); 
#formula_21 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot; (another interesting projection usually denoted by Π&quot;R&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) or ε&quot;t&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) with image a separable algebra &quot;HL&quot; or &quot;Ht&quot;, anti-isomorphic to &quot;HL&quot; via &quot;S&quot;);
#formula_22 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

:Note that if Δ(1) = 1 ⊗ 1, these conditions reduce to the two usual conditions on the antipode of a Hopf algebra.

The axioms are partly chosen so that the category of &quot;H&quot;-modules is a rigid monoidal category. The unit &quot;H&quot;-module is the separable algebra &quot;HL&quot; mentioned above. 
For example, a finite groupoid algebra is a weak Hopf algebra. In particular, the groupoid algebra on [n] with one pair of invertible arrows &quot;eij&quot; and &quot;eji&quot; between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; in [&quot;n&quot;] is isomorphic to the algebra &quot;H&quot; of &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; matrices. The weak Hopf algebra structure on this particular &quot;H&quot; is given by coproduct Δ(&quot;eij&quot;) = &quot;eij&quot; ⊗ &quot;eij&quot;, counit ε(&quot;eij&quot;) = 1 and antipode &quot;S&quot;(&quot;eij&quot;) = &quot;eji&quot;. The separable subalgebras &quot;HL&quot; and &quot;HR&quot; coincide and are non-central commutative algebras in this particular case (the subalgebra of diagonal matrices).

Early theoretical contributions to weak Hopf algebras are to be found in as well as

==Analogy with groups==
Groups can be axiomatized by the same diagrams (equivalently, operations) as a Hopf algebra, where &quot;G&quot; is taken to be a set instead of a module. In this case:
* the field &quot;K&quot; is replaced by the 1-point set
* there is a natural counit (map to 1 point)
* there is a natural comultiplication (the diagonal map)
* the unit is the identity element of the group
* the multiplication is the multiplication in the group
* the antipode is the inverse
In this philosophy, a group can be thought of as a Hopf algebra over the &quot;field with one element&quot;.

== Hopf algebras in braided monoidal categories ==
The definition of Hopf algebra is naturally extended to arbitrary braided monoidal categories. A Hopf algebra in such a category formula_23 is a sextuple formula_24 where formula_25 is an object in formula_26, and

: formula_27 (multiplication),

: formula_28 (unit),

: formula_29 (comultiplication),

: formula_30 (counit),

: formula_31 (antipode)

— are morphisms in formula_26 such that

:1) the triple formula_33 is a monoid in the monoidal category formula_23, i.e. the following diagrams are commutative:


:2) the triple formula_35 is a comonoid in the monoidal category formula_23, i.e. the following diagrams are commutative:


:3) the structures of monoid and comonoid on formula_25 are compatible: the multiplication formula_38 and the unit formula_39 are morphisms of comonoids, and (this is equivalent in this situation) at the same time the comultiplication formula_40 and the counit formula_41 are morphisms of monoids; this means that the following diagrams must be commutative:
 
 

: where formula_42 is the left unit morphism in formula_26, and formula_44 the natural transformation of functors formula_45 which is unique in the class of natural transformations of functors composed from the structural transformations (associativity, left and right units, transposition, and their inverses) in the category formula_26.

The quintuple formula_47 with the properties 1),2),3) is called a bialgebra in the category formula_23;

:4) the diagram of antipode is commutative:


The typical examples are the following.

* Groups. In the monoidal category formula_49 of sets (with the cartesian product formula_50 as the tensor product, and an arbitrary singletone, say, formula_51, as the unit object) a triple formula_33 is a monoid in the categorical sense if and only if it is a monoid in the usual algebraic sense, i.e. if the operations formula_53 and formula_54 behave like usual multiplication and unit in formula_25 (but possibly without the invertibility of elements formula_56). At the same time, a triple formula_35 is a comonoid in the categorical sense iff formula_40 is the diagonal operation formula_59 (and the operation formula_41 is defined uniquely as well: formula_61). And any such a structure of comonoid formula_35 is compatible with any structure of monoid formula_33 in the sense that the diagrams in the section 3 of the definition always commute. As a corollary, each monoid formula_33 in formula_49 can naturally be considered as a bialgebra formula_47 in formula_49, and vice versa. The existence of the antipode formula_31 for such a bialgebra formula_47 means exactly that every element formula_56 has an inverse element formula_71 with respect to the multiplication formula_53. Thus, in the category of sets formula_49 Hopf algebras are exactly groups in the usual algebraic sense.
* Classical Hopf algebras. In the special case when formula_74 is the category of vector spaces over a given field formula_9, the Hopf algebras in formula_74 are exactly the classical Hopf algebras described above.
* Functional algebras on groups. The standard functional algebras formula_77, formula_78, formula_79, formula_80 (of continuous, smooth, holomorphic, regular functions) on groups are Hopf algebras in the category (Ste,formula_81) of stereotype spaces,
* Group algebras. The stereotype group algebras formula_82, formula_83, formula_84, formula_85 (of measures, distributions, analytic functionals and currents) on groups are Hopf algebras in the category (Ste,formula_86) of stereotype spaces. These Hopf algebras are used in the duality theories for non-commutative groups.

<doc id="325717" wikidata="Q294308" url="?curid=325717" title="Publicly funded health care">
<text>Publicly funded healthcare is a form of health care financing designed to meet the cost of all or most healthcare needs from a publicly managed fund. Usually this is under some form of democratic accountability, the right of access to which are set down in rules applying to the whole population contributing to the fund or receiving benefits from it.

The fund may be a not-for-profit trust that pays out for healthcare according to common rules established by the members or by some other democratic form. In some countries, the fund is controlled directly by the government or by an agency of the government for the benefit of the entire population. That distinguishes it from other forms of private medical insurance, the rights of access to which are subject to contractual obligations between an insured person (or their sponsor) and an insurance company, which seeks to make a profit by managing the flow of funds between funders and providers of health care services.

When taxation is the primary means of financing health care and sometimes with compulsory insurance, all eligible people receive the same level of cover regardless of their financial circumstances or risk factors.

==Varieties of public systems==
Most developed countries have partially or fully publicly funded health systems. Most western industrial countries have a system of social insurance based on the principle of social solidarity that covers eligible people from bearing the direct burden of most health care expenditure, funded by taxation during their working life.

Among countries with significant public funding of healthcare there are many different approaches to the funding and provision of medical services. Systems may be funded from general government revenues (as in Canada, United Kingdom, Brazil and India) or through a government social security system (as in Australia, France, Belgium, Japan and Germany) with a separate budget and hypothecated taxes or contributions. The proportion of the cost of care covered also differs: in Canada, all hospital care is paid for by the government, while in Japan, patients must pay 10 to 30% of the cost of a hospital stay. Services provided by public systems vary. For example, the Belgian government pays the bulk of the fees for dental and eye care, while the Australian government covers eye care but not dental care.

Publicly funded medicine may be administered and provided by the government, as in the Nordic countries, Portugal, Spain, and Italy; in some systems, though, medicine is publicly funded but most hospital providers are private entities, as in Canada. The organization providing public health insurance is not necessarily a public administration, and its budget may be isolated from the main state budget. Some systems do not provide universal healthcare or restrict coverage to public health facilities. Some countries, such as Germany, have multiple public insurance organizations linked by a common legal framework. Some, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, allow private for-profit insurers to participate.

===Two-tier healthcare===
Almost every major country that has a publicly funded healthcare system also has a parallel private system for patients who hold private medical insurance or themselves pay for treatment. In those states, those able to pay have access to treatment and comforts that may not be available to those dependent upon the state system.

From the inception of the NHS model (1948), public hospitals in the United Kingdom have included &quot;amenity beds&quot; which would typically be siderooms fitted more comfortably, and private wards in some hospitals where for a fee more amenities are provided. Patients using these beds are in an NHS hospital for surgical treatment, and operations are generally carried out in the same operating theatres as NHS work and by the same personnel but the hospital and the physician receive funding from an insurance company or the patient. These amenity beds do not exist in all publicly funded systems, such as in Spain. The NHS also pays for private hospitals to take on surgical cases under contract.

==Policy discussion==
Many countries are seeking the right balance of public and private insurance, public subsidies, and out-of-pocket payments.

Many OECD countries have implemented reforms to achieve policy goals of ensuring access to health care, improving the quality of health care and health outcomes, allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare but at the same time ensuring that services are provided in a cost-efficient and cost-effective manner (microeconomic efficiency). A range of measures, such as better payment methods, have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers. However, introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;docteur/oxley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States because of Americans&#x27; lacking health insurance, equivalent to one excess death every 12 min. More broadly, the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care was estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.

<text>Beka Records was a record label based in Germany, active from about 1903 to 1925. Before World War I, Beka also made gramophone records for the United Kingdom market under the Beka-Grand Records label. The company became a subsidiary of the Carl Lindström Company which was sold to the Columbia Graphophone Company in 1926.

Artists on the label included Bert Alvey, Jessie Broughton, Albertina Cassani, Lucia Cavalli, Cook &amp; Carpenter, Gerhard Ebeler, Kappelle Willy Krug, Kapelle Merton, Miss Riboet, Phillip Ritte, the Beka London Orchestra, the Dobbri Saxophone Orchestra, the Martina Salon Orchestra, the Meister Orchestra, and the Royal Cowes Minstrels.

A history of Beka Records, together with a listing of known records issued by the label, is published by the City of London Phonograph and Gramophone Society (CLPGS) as part of their Reference Series of books.

<text>Sir Henry Tate, 1st Baronet (11 March 18195 December 1899) was an English merchant and philanthropist, noted for establishing the Tate Gallery and the company that became Tate &amp; Lyle.

==Early life==
Henry Tate was born in White Coppice on 11 March 1819, the son of Agnes (née Booth) and William Tate. His father was a Unitarian clergyman.

==Career==
When Tate was 13, he became a grocer&#x27;s apprentice in Liverpool. After a seven-year apprenticeship, he was able to set up his own shop in nearby Birkenhead. His business was successful, and grew to a chain of six stores by the time he was 35. In 1859, he became a partner in the John Wright &amp; Co. sugar refinery, selling his grocery business in 1861. By 1869, he had gained complete control of the company, and renamed it to Henry Tate &amp; Sons. In 1872, he purchased the patent from Eugen Langen for making sugar cubes and built a new refinery in Liverpool. In 1877, he opened another refinery in the Silvertown district of London, which remains open; at the time, Silvertown was still mostly marshland.

==Charity==

Upon becoming wealthy, Tate donated generously to charity. In 1889, he donated his collection of 65 contemporary paintings to the British government, on the condition that they be displayed in a suitable gallery; he also donated £80,000 toward the construction of said gallery, which is now known as Tate Britain and opened on 21 July 1897 on the site of the old Millbank Prison.

Tate made many donations, often anonymously and always discreetly, and supported &quot;alternative&quot; and non-establishment causes. For example, he donated £10,000 for the library of what is now Oxford University&#x27;s Harris Manchester College, though it was originally founded in Warrington in 1786 as a dissenting academy to provide religious nonconformists with higher education. He also gave the college £5,000 to promote the &quot;theory and art of preaching&quot;. In addition, he gave £20,000 to the Liverpool Homeopathic Hospital in 1885. He particularly supported health and education with his money, giving £42,500 to Liverpool University, £3,500 to Bedford College for Women, and £5,000 to Streatham Library. In addition to Streatham, provisions were made for libraries in other areas of London such as Balham, Brixton, and South Lambeth. He gave £8,000 to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary and £5,000 to the Queen&#x27;s Nursing Institute.

==Personal life==
Tate had a reputation as a modest man who was often concerned with improving his workers&#x27; conditions, and had the Tate Institute built opposite his London refinery with a bar and dance hall for their recreation.

Tate was made a baronet on 27 June 1898. He had refused this title more than once untilafter he had spent £150,000 to build the Millbank Gallery, endowed it with his personal collection, and presented it to the nationhe was told the royal family would be offended if he refused again.

Tate married Jane Wignall in Liverpool on 1 March 1841. They lived at Park Hill near Streatham Common in London, had three sons together, and remained married until her death on 29 November 1883.

==Death==
Tate died in Streatham on 5 December 1899 at the age of 80, and was buried in nearby West Norwood Cemetery, the gates of which are opposite a public library to which he donated. His home, Park Hill, later became a nunnery before it was refurbished as housing. In 1921, his company Henry Tate &amp; Sons merged with Abram Lyle &amp; Sons to form Tate &amp; Lyle.

==Legacy==
In 2001, a blue plaque commemorating Tate was unveiled on the site of his first shop at 42 Hamilton Street in Birkenhead.

In 2006, a Wetherspoons pub in Chorley (close to Tate&#x27;s birthplace of White Coppice) was named after him.

<doc id="325724" wikidata="Q642944" url="?curid=325724" title="Negima! Magister Negi Magi">
<text>Negima! Magister Negi Magi, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ken Akamatsu. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from February 2003 to March 2012, with its chapters collected into 38 volumes.

&quot;Negima!&quot; was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series produced by Xebec that was broadcast on TV Tokyo from January to June 2005. A second 26-episode series produced by Shaft titled &quot;Negima!?&quot;, which is alternate retelling, was broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 2006 to March 2007. In addition, four different sets of original video animations, an anime film and a live-action television series have also been produced.

In North America, the manga was licensed for English language release by Del Rey Manga and later by Kodansha USA. In the UK the first sixteen volumes were published by Tanoshimi. Both anime and the second OVAs were licensed by Funimation. Sentai Filmworks re-licensed the series in 2018. In 2023, Sentai lost the licenses to Negima and it was removed from HIDIVE.

Akamatsu collaborated with an artist named Yui to write the spin-off &quot;Negiho&quot; in 2010. In 2013, Akamatsu began a sequel/spin off titled &quot;UQ Holder!&quot; that focuses on Negi&#x27;s grandson, Tōta Konoe. Due to the two anime series and live action TV shows having plots that are totally different from that of the Manga and the existence of spin-off manga that are fresh new takes of the Negima plot, Negima has become subject to Transmedia storytelling.

==Plot==

While looking for clues about his missing father Nagi, Negi Springfield becomes the English and homeroom teacher for Mahora Academy Class 2A (later 3A). Negi soon becomes acquainted with most of his new students including his roommates Asuna Kagurazaka and Konoka Konoe. Negi faces his first real challenge in his student Evangeline A.K. McDowell who is an immortal vampiress and one of his father&#x27;s enemies. To help Negi confront Eva, Asuna agrees to become his temporary partner by performing a &quot;Pactio&quot;, a kind of magical contract sealed with a kiss.

After dealing with Evangeline, Negi takes the class on a trip to Kyoto while searching for more information on his father&#x27;s whereabouts but is forced to fight against Eastern mages aiming to kidnap Konoka with the help of other students who also become his partners including Nodoka Miyazaki, Konoka&#x27;s childhood friend Setsuna Sakurazaki, and lastly with Konoka herself. The arc also introduces Fate Averruncus, another mage who looks to be around Negi&#x27;s age but proves himself to be far stronger than him. Seeing his own weakness after the events in Kyoto, Negi begins to train with several students in order to become stronger while Kotaro Inugami, one of the foes he confronted there unexpectedly reappears and finds himself a family with Negi&#x27;s students Natsumi and Chizuru. Kotaro also joins Negi against Wilheim, an old evil from the past who like Fate Averruncus, seems to be a pawn of an even stronger enemy.

During Mahora&#x27;s cultural festival, Negi manages to partake in simultaneous events thanks to his student Chao Lingshen&#x27;s latest invention, the time machine &quot;Casseopeia&quot;. One of these events is the &quot;Mahora Martial Arts Tournament&quot; where he confronts a series of increasingly stronger enemies including a former member of &quot;Ala Rubra&quot; (Crimson Wing), a legendary brigade led by his father. After the tournament, Negi takes part in more activities at the festival until Chao she reveals herself as a time-traveler who claims she must change the present to avert a great catastrophe in the future. Despite that, Negi and his allies confront Chao and stop her. After giving, Chao bids farewell before returning to her own time.

After the festival, Negi decides to go to the Mundus Magicus (Magic World) to look for his father. His partners decide to accompany him and together they form their own brigade, the Ala Alba (White Wing). They are joined by Negi&#x27;s childhood friend Anya and accidentally by other students who are oblivious to his secret. As they arrive, the team is ambushed by a group of mysterious enemies led by Fate Averruncus, leaving Negi and his group defeated and scattered across Mundus Magicus. After meeting Jack Rakan, another member of Ala Rubra, Negi decides to train in order to become stronger and specializes in Dark Magic, like Evangeline. Meanwhile, Negi&#x27;s lost companions start to learn the ropes of their new environment and eventually reunite with him.

During another clash with Fate and his companions, Asuna is captured by the enemy and held captive along with Anya, with a body double posing as the real Asuna. Later Negi has an encounter with Kurt Gödel, a former member of Ala Rubra who reveals to him the story of his parents including how his mother was unjustly tried and sentenced to death before being saved by Nagi at the brink of her execution. He also learns that the Magic World is actually a magically created, inhabitable version of Mars, and just like the world itself, the majority of its inhabitants are created by magic. During another clash with Fate, Negi also learns that the main objective of his group &quot;Cosmo Entelecheia&quot; is to make use of Asuna&#x27;s secret powers to erase the magically created inhabitants of Mundus Magicus and transfer the rest of its population to Earth before it eventually collapses.

By joining forces with the various armies of the Magic World, the members of Ala Alba storm Cosmo Entelecheia&#x27;s stronghold where Asuna and Anya are being held captive, to stop their plans. During the confrontation a magic gate is opened to Earth just above Mahora, having Negi&#x27;s remaining students who stayed behind along with the academy&#x27;s faculty members joining the fight. After rescuing Asuna and convincing Fate to accept a plan to save the people of the Magic World without the need of any sacrifices, Negi discovers that the true leader of Cosmo Entelecheia is none other than his father Nagi, possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who vanishes after asking his son to look for him and release him once and for all.

After being celebrated as heroes for stopping Cosmo Entelecheia, Negi and his friends return to the academy, but instead of resuming his duties as a teacher, Negi leaves Fate as his substitute and with the help of some of his students he starts working on his plan to terraform Mars for the people of the decaying Magic World to relocate there. The plan involves sealing Asuna&#x27;s body for one hundred years, and she bids farewell to Negi and the other students after she graduates from middle school. Waking up 30 years after the estimated time, Asuna finds that Negi&#x27;s plan was a success and that Negi and all her classmates had happy and bountiful lives, but had long since died, all except for the immortal Evangeline, and Chao who exists in this time and has since invented a device to jump between realities. These two appear before Asuna to take her back to the present so she can live out her days with Negi and the others.

Seven Years later, Negi and gang defeat the Mage of the Beginning for good and Negi&#x27;s father was no longer possessed by him. Negi finally reunites with his father as Ala Alba and Ala Rubra bond together as they celebrate their victory. 

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot;, written and illustrated by Ken Akamatsu, was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from February 26, 2003, to March 14, 2012. Kodansha collected its 355 individual chapters in thirty-eight volumes, released from July 16, 2003, to May 17, 2012.

====English version====

In North America, the series was licensed for English language release by Del Rey Manga. Del Rey announced that the series would be censored, however, it was later stated that it would be uncensored but shrink-wrapped with a label stating &quot;Contains Explicit Content, Ages 16+&quot; on the volumes&#x27; cover. Akamatsu stated that he was not angry with the edits, but rather amused. From volume 13 onwards the manga was published without the shrink-wrap. Del Rey published the first 28 volumes from April 27, 2004, to October 26, 2010. In October 2010, Kodansha USA announced that they would take over Del Rey titles, including &quot;Negima!&quot;. Kodansha USA release the remaining 29–38 volumes from May 17, 2011, to April 23, 2013. Kodansha also republished the first twenty-seven volumes in nine omnibus volumes from June 14, 2011, to February 11, 2014.

In the United Kingdom, the first sixteen volumes of the manga were published by Tanoshimi from August 3, 2006, to December 6, 2007.

===Anime===
====Introduction original video animations====
Before the beginning of the series, three original video animations (OVAs) were produced to introduce the characters. The first two were released on DVD bundled with two drama CDs, with the third being sold separately.

The first OVA is a re-enactment of the first chapter, where Negi first learns of his job as a teacher and is introduced to the students of Mahora Academy 2-A. It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka.

The second OVA is a re-enactment of the &quot;love potion&quot; incident of chapter 2, with profiles at the end of Nodoka, Konoka, the cheerleaders (Misa, Madoka, Sakurako) as well as Kazumi.

The third OVA is a re-enactment of chapter 13: Negi&#x27;s Mahora tour with the Narutaki twins. The tour shows Negi to several of the students (Yuna, Akira, Chao, Satsuki, Satomi, Chizuru, Natsumi, Zazie) as well as others that he ends up missing (Sayo, Evangeline, Chachamaru, Chisame, Misora, Ako). After being chewed out by Haruna for completely skipping her, a final scene introduces Setsuna and Mana.

====Television series====

The anime began airing in Japan on January 6, 2005, and ended June 29, 2005. The anime follows the story of the manga to a certain degree but also creates its own reasons for certain events happening - most of which take place towards the end of the series - which differ from the original story, as the situations addressed had yet to occur in the source material. The differences between the manga and anime are significant, and most events in the manga never occur in the anime, again due in part to the manga being incomplete during the series&#x27; production. Starting in episode 22 and continuing until the end of the series, original work was created so the series would have a conclusion. At one time it aired as part of the Funimation programming block on CoLours TV.

A second series was announced on May 9, 2006, by Shaft and directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, the director of &quot;Pani Poni Dash!&quot; and &quot;Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase-&quot;. It started airing in Japan on October 4, 2006. &quot;Negima!?&quot; is an alternate story with different character designs and an all new storyline, albeit with the same characters. The show also focuses more towards breaking the fourth wall, action, and comedy, and less on the original series&#x27; fanservice.

====Spring and Summer OVAs====
Two OVAs directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and produced by Shaft have been released, a Spring OVA and a Summer OVA. Both OVA&#x27;s were released on DVD in English dub on October 14, 2008.

The Spring OVA called &quot;Negima!? Haru&quot; was shown to a private audience in Japan in April 2006 and was released for the public in DVD on October 25, 2006. It is based on the trip to the Southern Islands in volume 7 of the manga. The story is about how Negi makes up to Asuna after saying to Asuna that she should not mind his business.

The Summer (Natsu) OVA was also shown to a private audience in September 2006, and the DVD was released on November 22, 2006. The beginning is about Nodoka and Yue practicing casting a spell. While training, Yue convinces Nodoka that they cast a spell of the red string of fate on Nodoka. A spell which shows them who her future partner will be. One end connects to Nodoka and the other end connects to Negi. Unfortunately, this spell is not a fate connection, but just a tie-up. The rest of the OVA are about how Nodoka and Negi spend the rest of the day trying to take their bath while their hands are tied together.

====&quot;White Wing&quot; OADs====
A third set of OVAs (officially an &quot;OAD&quot; or &quot;Original Animation Disc&quot; as these are limited edition OVA releases that are only sold with the purchase of specific volumes of the manga) called was announced by Ken Akamatsu on his website days after the end of the live-action adaptation&#x27;s airing. Production was handled by Shaft in cooperation with Studio Pastoral and the entire cast from &quot;Negima!?&quot; reprised their roles. The new OVAs cover chapters 176 to 183, and are shown in three parts:

# The first OAD covers chapters 176 and 177 and was released on August 12, 2008, together with the release of Volume 23 of the manga.
# The second OAD covers chapters 178 to 180 and was released on November 17, 2008, together with the release of Volume 24 of the manga.
## A limited edition Negima audio drama CD was released on December 19, 2008, and covers chapter 181.
# The third OAD shows chapters 181 to 183 and was released on February 17, 2009, together with the release of Volume 25 of the manga.

Just like previous Negima adaptations by Shaft, Akiyuki Shinbo served as the director, together with the same staff as his previous works.

From the &quot;Negi no Ochakai&quot; event that was held in May 2008, Ken Akamatsu mentioned that if pre-orders for the first of the OADs exceed 50,000 the staff would consider a film adaptation, and if it exceeded 100,000 views, the staff would consider a third animated series. The counter on the official website reached 82,581 before the first OAD was released. The total sales of three volumes was 245,000 copies.

====&quot;Another World&quot; OADs====
A fourth set of OADs was announced in the &quot;Mahō Sensei Negima: Ala Alba&quot; event held on February 11, 2009. The series is officially titled . This OAD series, covering the &quot;Journey to Magic World&quot; arc, was exclusively bundled with the manga starting with volume 27. The first episode, adapting chapters 184 through 188, was released on September 17, 2009; the second, which adapts chapters 189 through 192, was released on December 17, 2009. The third, covering chapters 193–204, was released on May 17, 2010, the fourth on August 17, 2010, and the fifth was released on November 17, 2010. Just like the previous OAD adaption, this series is produced by Shaft in cooperation with Studio Pastoral.

====Film====
Akamatsu announced in his web diary that they can now initiate &quot;the project&quot; freely because the number of the pre-orders of the new OAD Mahou Sensei Negima! Mō Hitotsu no Sekai was large enough. He said he could not explicitly disclose what &quot;the project&quot; is from now since the sales data turned Akamatsu&#x27;s personal desire into a real project. He had been saying that the final chapter of the OAD series will be released as a movie if the sales are successful. Weekly Shōnen Magazine announced a &quot;full-length&quot; anime that would be premiered in 2011 and used the term &quot;Negima Saga Final&quot;.

On May 17, 2011, the official site opened with the new title &quot;Mahō Sensei Negima: Anime Final&quot; and was released in Japanese theaters on August 27, 2011, as a double-bill with Hayate the Combat Butler! Heaven Is a Place on Earth. The movie provided an alternate ending to the &quot;Journey to Magic World&quot; arc. A CD was released on August 24, 2011, featuring the theme songs of the movie along with the off vocal versions.

===Live-action series===
A live-action series of &quot;Mahō Sensei Negima!&quot;, distinguished from the manga, first anime television series (&quot;Negima!, having an exclamation mark) and the second anime television series (&quot;Negima!?, having the equivalent of an interrobang) by having two exclamation marks joined at the dot (or, &quot;Negima!!&quot;). The cast of all of the 31 girls was released in July 2007, while it is announced later that actress Yukina Kashiwa would play Negi, Hiroshi would portray Takamichi T. Takahata, former AV star Nao Oikawa as Shizuna Minamoto, and Gajirō Satō as the school dean. It started in TV Tokyo&#x27;s late-night timeslot on October 3, 2007, and ran for 25 episodes. The 26th announced episode was a DVD exclusive.

Like &quot;Negima!?&quot;, the live-action series has an entirely different storyline from the manga and the first anime series.

===Music===

A large amount of music related to &quot;Negima!&quot; has been released. Aside from the numerous opening and ending theme songs used in the two anime adaptations, four OVA sets and the film, several character songs have been released.

===Video games===
Negi Springfield appears as a playable character in the 2009 PlayStation Portable fighting game &quot;Sunday vs Magazine: Shūketsu! Chōjō Daikessen&quot;.

<text>Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of &quot;nodes&quot; (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the &quot;ties&quot;, &quot;edges&quot;, or &quot;links&quot; (relationships or interactions) that connect them. Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, meme proliferation, information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. These networks are often visualized through &quot;sociograms&quot; in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.

Social network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. It has also gained significant popularity in the following: anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies, economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, physics, political science, public health, social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science, education and distance education research, and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the list of SNA software).

==History==
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg Simmel and Émile Durkheim, who wrote about the importance of studying patterns of relationships that connect social actors. Social scientists have used the concept of &quot;social networks&quot; since early in the 20th century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international.

In the 1930s Jacob Moreno and Helen Jennings introduced basic analytical methods. In 1954, John Arundel Barnes started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, ethnicity).

Starting in the 1970s, scholars such as Ronald Burt, Kathleen Carley, Mark Granovetter, David Krackhardt, Edward Laumann, Anatol Rapoport, Barry Wellman, Douglas R. White, and Harrison White expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced a further resurgence with work by sociologists, political scientists, economists, computer scientists, and physicists such as Duncan J. Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Peter Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, James H. Fowler, Mark Newman, Matthew Jackson, Jon Kleinberg, and others, developing and applying new models and methods, prompted in part by the emergence of new data available about online social networks as well as &quot;digital traces&quot; regarding face-to-face networks.

Computational SNA has been extensively used in research on study-abroad second language acquisition. Even in the study of literature, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo, Wouter De Nooy, and Burgert Senekal. Indeed, social network analysis has found applications in various academic disciplines as well as practical contexts such as countering money laundering and terrorism.

==Metrics==
Size: The number of network members in a given network.

===Connections===
Homophily: The extent to which actors form ties with similar versus dissimilar others. Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values or any other salient characteristic. Homophily is also referred to as assortativity.

Multiplexity: The number of content-forms contained in a tie. For example, two people who are friends and also work together would have a multiplexity of 2. Multiplexity has been associated with relationship strength and can also comprise overlap of positive and negative network ties.

Mutuality/Reciprocity: The extent to which two actors reciprocate each other&#x27;s friendship or other interaction.

Network Closure: A measure of the completeness of relational triads. An individual&#x27;s assumption of network closure (i.e. that their friends are also friends) is called transitivity. Transitivity is an outcome of the individual or situational trait of Need for Cognitive Closure.

Propinquity: The tendency for actors to have more ties with geographically close others.

===Distributions===
Bridge: An individual whose weak ties fill a structural hole, providing the only link between two individuals or clusters. It also includes the shortest route when a longer one is unfeasible due to a high risk of message distortion or delivery failure.

Centrality: Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the &quot;importance&quot; or &quot;influence&quot; (in a variety of senses) of a particular node (or group) within a network. Examples of common methods of measuring &quot;centrality&quot; include betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, alpha centrality, and degree centrality.

Density: The proportion of direct ties in a network relative to the total number possible.

Distance: The minimum number of ties required to connect two particular actors, as popularized by Stanley Milgram&#x27;s small world experiment and the idea of &#x27;six degrees of separation&#x27;.

Structural holes: The absence of ties between two parts of a network. Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an entrepreneur a competitive advantage. This concept was developed by sociologist Ronald Burt, and is sometimes referred to as an alternate conception of social capital.

Tie Strength: Defined by the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocity (i.e. mutuality). Strong ties are associated with homophily, propinquity and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridges.

===Segmentation===
Groups are identified as &#x27;cliques&#x27; if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, &#x27;social circles&#x27; if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as structurally cohesive blocks if precision is wanted.

Clustering coefficient: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater &#x27;cliquishness&#x27;.

Cohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by cohesive bonds. Structural cohesion refers to the minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.

==Modelling and visualization of networks==

Visual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis. Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented. Many of the analytic software have modules for network visualization. The data is explored by displaying nodes and ties in various layouts and attributing colors, size, and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information. Still, care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses.

Signed graphs can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating), and a negative edge denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of &quot;balanced&quot; and &quot;unbalanced&quot; cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a cycle where the product of all the signs are positive. According to balance theory, balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, and yet C and A have a negative relationship, is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to change into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concepts of balanced and unbalanced graphs, the evolution of a social network graph may be forecasted.

Different approaches to participatory network mapping have proven useful, especially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change. Here, participants/interviewers provide network data by mapping the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. An example of a pen-and-paper network mapping approach, which also includes the collection of some actor attributes (perceived influence and goals of actors) is the * Net-map toolbox. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.

===Social networking potential===
Social Networking Potential (SNP) is a numeric coefficient, derived through algorithms to represent both the size of an individual&#x27;s social network and their ability to influence that network. SNP coefficients were first defined and used by Bob Gerstley in 2002. A closely related term is Alpha User, defined as a person with a high SNP.

SNP coefficients have two primary functions:
# The classification of individuals based on their social networking potential, and
# The weighting of in quantitative marketing research studies.

By calculating the SNP of respondents and by targeting High SNP respondents, the strength and relevance of quantitative marketing research used to drive viral marketing strategies is enhanced.

Variables used to calculate an individual&#x27;s SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym &quot;SNP&quot; and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual&#x27;s social networking potential were described in the white paper &quot;Advertising Research is Changing&quot; (Gerstley, 2003) See Viral Marketing.

The first book to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of social marketing intelligence was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen &amp; Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco (UCL) presents at TEDx the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the potential energy that users generate and companies should use, stating that &quot;SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have&quot;.

==Practical applications==

Social network analysis is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines. Some common network analysis applications include data aggregation and mining, network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, social sharing and filtering, recommender systems development, and link prediction and entity resolution. In the private sector, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, information system development analysis, marketing, and business intelligence needs (see social media analytics). Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use, and community-based problem solving.

=== Longitudinal SNA in schools ===
Large numbers of researchers worldwide examine the social networks of children and adolescents. In questionnaires, they list all classmates, students in the same grade, or schoolmates, asking: &quot;Who are your best friends?&quot;. Students may sometimes nominate as many peers as they wish; other times, the number of nominations is limited. Social network researchers have investigated similarities in friendship networks. The similarity between friends was established as far back as classical antiquity. Resemblance is an important basis for the survival of friendships. Similarity in characteristics, attitudes, or behaviors means that friends understand each other more quickly, have common interests to talk about, know better where they stand with each other, and have more trust in each other. As a result, such relationships are more stable and valuable. Moreover, looking more alike makes young people more confident and strengthens them in developing their identity. Similarity in behavior can result from two processes: selection and influence. These two processes can be distinguished using longitudinal social network analysis in the R package SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analyses), developed by Tom Snijders and colleagues. Longitudinal social network analysis became mainstream after the publication of a special issue of the &quot;Journal of Research on Adolescence&quot; in 2013, edited by René Veenstra and containing 15 empirical papers.

=== Security applications ===
Social network analysis is also used in intelligence, counter-intelligence and law enforcement activities. This technique allows the analysts to map covert organizations such as an espionage ring, an organized crime family or a street gang. The National Security Agency (NSA) uses its electronic surveillance programs to generate the data needed to perform this type of analysis on terrorist cells and other networks deemed relevant to national security. The NSA looks up to three nodes deep during this network analysis. After the initial mapping of the social network is complete, analysis is performed to determine the structure of the network and determine, for example, the leaders within the network. This allows military or law enforcement assets to launch capture-or-kill decapitation attacks on the high-value targets in leadership positions to disrupt the functioning of the network.
The NSA has been performing social network analysis on call detail records (CDRs), also known as metadata, since shortly after the September 11 attacks.

=== Textual analysis applications ===
Large textual corpora can be turned into networks and then analyzed using social network analysis. In these networks, the nodes are Social Actors, and the links are Actions. The extraction of these networks can be automated by using parsers. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as the robustness or structural stability of the overall network or the centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.

In other approaches, textual analysis is carried out considering the network of words co-occurring in a text. In these networks, nodes are words and links among them are weighted based on their frequency of co-occurrence (within a specific maximum range).

=== Internet applications ===
Social network analysis has also been applied to understanding online behavior by individuals, organizations, and between websites. Hyperlink analysis can be used to analyze the connections between websites or webpages to examine how information flows as individuals navigate the web. The connections between organizations has been analyzed via hyperlink analysis to examine which organizations within an issue community.

==== Netocracy ====
Another concept that has emerged from this connection between social network theory and the Internet is the concept of netocracy, where several authors have emerged studying the correlation between the extended use of online social networks, and changes in social power dynamics.

==== Social media internet applications ====
Social network analysis has been applied to social media as a tool to understand behavior between individuals or organizations through their linkages on social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook.

===In computer-supported collaborative learning===
One of the most current methods of the application of SNA is to the study of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). When applied to CSCL, SNA is used to help understand how learners collaborate in terms of amount, frequency, and length, as well as the quality, topic, and strategies of communication. Additionally, SNA can focus on specific aspects of the network connection, or the entire network as a whole. It uses graphical representations, written representations, and data representations to help examine the connections within a CSCL network. When applying SNA to a CSCL environment the interactions of the participants are treated as a social network. The focus of the analysis is on the &quot;connections&quot; made among the participants – how they interact and communicate – as opposed to how each participant behaved on his or her own.

====Key terms====
There are several key terms associated with social network analysis research in computer-supported collaborative learning such as: density, centrality, indegree, outdegree, and sociogram.
* Density refers to the &quot;connections&quot; between participants. Density is defined as the number of connections a participant has, divided by the total possible connections a participant could have. For example, if there are 20 people participating, each person could potentially connect to 19 other people. A density of 100% (19/19) is the greatest density in the system. A density of 5% indicates there is only 1 of 19 possible connections.
* Centrality focuses on the behavior of individual participants within a network. It measures the extent to which an individual interacts with other individuals in the network. The more an individual connects to others in a network, the greater their centrality in the network.

In-degree and out-degree variables are related to centrality.
* In-degree centrality concentrates on a specific individual as the point of focus; centrality of all other individuals is based on their relation to the focal point of the &quot;in-degree&quot; individual.
* Out-degree is a measure of centrality that still focuses on a single individual, but the analytic is concerned with the out-going interactions of the individual; the measure of out-degree centrality is how many times the focus point individual interacts with others.
* A sociogram is a visualization with defined boundaries of connections in the network. For example, a sociogram which shows out-degree centrality points for Participant A would illustrate all outgoing connections Participant A made in the studied network.

====Unique capabilities====
Researchers employ social network analysis in the study of computer-supported collaborative learning in part due to the unique capabilities it offers. This particular method allows the study of interaction patterns within a networked learning community and can help illustrate the extent of the participants&#x27; interactions with the other members of the group. The graphics created using SNA tools provide visualizations of the connections among participants and the strategies used to communicate within the group. Some authors also suggest that SNA provides a method of easily analyzing changes in participatory patterns of members over time.

A number of research studies have applied SNA to CSCL across a variety of contexts. The findings include the correlation between a network&#x27;s density and the teacher&#x27;s presence, a greater regard for the recommendations of &quot;central&quot; participants, infrequency of cross-gender interaction in a network, and the relatively small role played by an instructor in an asynchronous learning network.

====Other methods used alongside SNA====
Although many studies have demonstrated the value of social network analysis within the computer-supported collaborative learning field, researchers have suggested that SNA by itself is not enough for achieving a full understanding of CSCL. The complexity of the interaction processes and the myriad sources of data make it difficult for SNA to provide an in-depth analysis of CSCL. Researchers indicate that SNA needs to be complemented with other methods of analysis to form a more accurate picture of collaborative learning experiences.

A number of research studies have combined other types of analysis with SNA in the study of CSCL. This can be referred to as a multi-method approach or data triangulation, which will lead to an increase of evaluation reliability in CSCL studies.
* Qualitative method – The principles of qualitative case study research constitute a solid framework for the integration of SNA methods in the study of CSCL experiences.
** &quot;Ethnographic data&quot; such as student questionnaires and interviews and classroom non-participant observations
** &quot;Case studies&quot;: comprehensively study particular CSCL situations and relate findings to general schemes
** &quot;Content analysis:&quot; offers information about the content of the communication among members
* Quantitative method – This includes simple descriptive statistical analyses on occurrences to identify particular attitudes of group members who have not been able to be tracked via SNA in order to detect general tendencies.
** &quot;Computer log files:&quot; provide automatic data on how collaborative tools are used by learners
** &quot;Multidimensional scaling (MDS)&quot;: charts similarities among actors, so that more similar input data is closer together
** &quot;Software tools:&quot; QUEST, SAMSA (System for Adjacency Matrix and Sociogram-based Analysis), and Nud*IST

<text>WWVB is a longwave time signal radio station near Fort Collins, Colorado and is operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Most radio-controlled clocks in North America use WWVB&#x27;s transmissions to set the correct time.

The normal signal transmitted from WWVB is 70 kW ERP and uses a 60 kHz carrier wave yielding a frequency uncertainty of less than 1 part in 10. The time code signal is derived from a set of atomic clocks located at the site, and transmitted using the IRIG &quot;H&quot; format and modulated onto the carrier wave using pulse-width modulation and amplitude-shift keying at one bit per second. A single complete frame of time code begins at the start of each minute, lasts one minute, and conveys the year, day of year, hour, minute, and other information .

WWVB is co-located with WWV, a time signal station that broadcasts in both voice and time code on multiple shortwave radio frequencies. WWVB is not an acronym or abbreviation but a call sign for the radio station.

While most time signals encode the local time of the broadcasting nation, the United States spans multiple time zones, so WWVB broadcasts the time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Radio-controlled clocks can then apply time zone and daylight saving time offsets as needed to display local time. The time used in the broadcast is set by the NIST Time Scale, known as UTC(NIST). This time scale is the calculated average time of an ensemble of master clocks, themselves calibrated by the NIST-F1 and NIST-F2 cesium fountain atomic clocks.

In 2011, NIST estimated the number of radio clocks and wristwatches equipped with a WWVB receiver at over 50 million.

WWVB, along with NIST&#x27;s shortwave time code-and-announcement stations WWV and WWVH, were proposed for defunding and elimination in the 2019 NIST budget. However, the final 2019 NIST budget preserved funding for the three stations.

At midnight on April 7, 2024, WWVB&#x27;s south antenna was disabled due to damage sustained during high winds. WWVB then transmitted exclusively from the north antenna, at a reduced power of 30kW. On May 20, 2024, NIST announced that the necessary replacement parts were being manufactured and shipped, with expected service restoration at the end of September 2024. As of October 10, 2024, WWVB was back to operating at full power.

== History ==

LF and VLF (very low frequency) broadcasts have long been used to distribute time and frequency standards. As early as 1904, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) was broadcasting time signals from the city of Boston as an aid to navigation. This experiment and others like it made it evident that LF and VLF signals could cover a large area using a relatively low power. By 1923, NIST radio station WWV had begun broadcasting standard carrier signals to the public on frequencies ranging from 75 to 2,000 kHz.

These signals were used to calibrate radio equipment, which became increasingly important as more and more stations became operational. Over the years, many radio navigation systems were designed using stable time and frequency signals broadcast on the LF and VLF bands. The best known of these navigation systems was the now-obsolete Loran-C, which allowed ships and planes to navigate via reception of 100 kHz signals broadcast from multiple transmitters.

What is now WWVB began as radio station KK2XEI in July 1956. The transmitter was located in Boulder, Colorado, and the effective radiated power (ERP) was just 1.4 watts. Even so, the signal was able to be monitored at Harvard University in Massachusetts. The purpose of this experimental transmission was to show that the radio path was stable and the frequency error was small at low frequencies.

In 1962, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) — now known as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — began building a new facility at a site near Fort Collins, Colorado. This site became the home of WWVB and WWVL, a 20 kHz station that was moved from the mountains west of Boulder.

The site was attractive for several reasons, one being its exceptionally high ground conductivity, which was due to the high alkalinity of the soil. It was also reasonably close to Boulder (about ), which made it easy to staff and manage, but much farther away from the mountains, which made it a better choice for broadcasting an omnidirectional signal.

WWVB went on the air on July 4, 1963 (July 5 at 00:00 UTC), broadcasting a 5 kW ERP signal on 60 kHz. WWVL began transmitting a 0.5 kW ERP signal on 20 kHz the following month, using frequency-shift keying, shifting from 20 kHz to 26 kHz, to send data. The WWVL broadcast was discontinued in July 1972, while WWVB became a permanent part of the nation&#x27;s infrastructure.

A time code was added to WWVB on July 1, 1965. This made it possible for clocks to be designed that could receive the signal, decode it, and then automatically synchronize themselves. The time code format has changed only slightly since 1965; it sends a decimal time code, using four binary bits to send each digit in binary-coded decimal (BCD).

The ERP of WWVB has been increased several times. It was raised to 7 kW and then 13 kW ERP early in its life and remained so for many years. As part of a WWVB modernization program in the late 1990s, the decommissioned WWVL antenna was refurbished and incorporated into the current phased array. Using both antennas simultaneously resulted in an increase until a major upgrade during 1998 boosted the ERP to 50 kW in 1999, and finally to 70 kW in 2005. The station also became able to operate on one antenna, with an ERP of 27 kW, while engineers could carry out maintenance on the other.

The power increase made the coverage area much larger, and made it easier for tiny receivers with simple antennas to receive the signal. This resulted in the introduction of many new low-cost radio controlled clocks that &quot;set themselves&quot; to agree with NIST time.

===Service improvement plans===
WWVB&#x27;s Colorado location makes the signal weakest on the U.S. east coast, where urban density also produces considerable interference. In 2009, NIST raised the possibility of adding a second time code transmitter, on the east coast, to improve signal reception there and provide a certain amount of robustness to the overall system should weather or other causes render one transmitter site inoperative. Such a transmitter would use the same time code, but a different frequency.

Use of 40 kHz would permit use of dual-frequency time code receivers already produced for the Japanese JJY transmitters. With the decommissioning of the Swiss longwave time station HBG on 75 kHz, that frequency is potentially also available.

Plans were made to install the transmitter on the grounds of the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, but the Marshall Space Flight Center objected to having such a high power transmitter so near to their operations. Funding, which was allocated as part of the 2009 ARRA &quot;stimulus bill&quot;, expired before the impasse could be resolved, and it is now unlikely to be built.

NIST explored two other ideas in 2012. One was to add a second transmission frequency at the current transmitter site. While it would not have helped signal strength, it would have reduced the incidence of interference and (frequency-dependent) multipath fading.

None of the ideas for a second transmitter were implemented.

Instead, NIST implemented the second idea, adding phase modulation to the WWVB carrier, in 2012. This requires no additional transmitters or antennas, and phase modulation had already been used successfully by the German DCF77 and French TDF time signals. A receiver that decodes the phase modulation can have greater process gain, allowing usable reception at a lower received signal-to-noise ratio than the PWM/ASK time code. The method is more fully described later in this article.

==Antennas==


The WWVB signal is transmitted via a phased array of two identical antenna systems, spaced apart, one of which was previously used for WWVL. Each consists of four towers that are used to suspend a &quot;top-loaded monopole&quot; (umbrella antenna), consisting of a diamond-shaped &quot;web&quot; of several cables in a horizontal plane (a capacitive &quot;top-hat&quot;) supported by the towers, and a downlead (vertical cable) in the middle that connects the top-hat to a &quot;helix house&quot; on the ground. In this configuration, the downlead is the radiating element of the antenna. Each helix house contains a dual fixed-variable inductor system, which is automatically matched to the transmitter via a feedback loop to keep the antenna system at its maximum radiating efficiency. The combination of the downlead and top-hat is designed to replace a single, quarter-wavelength antenna, which, at 60 kHz, would have to be an impractical tall.

==Modulation format==
WWVB transmits data at one bit per second, taking 60 seconds to send the current time of day and date within a century. There are two independent time codes used for this purpose: An amplitude-modulated time code, which has been in use with minor changes since 1962, and a phase-modulated time code added in late 2012.

===Amplitude modulation===
The WWVB 60 kHz carrier, which has a normal ERP of 70 kW, is reduced in power at the start of each UTC second by 17 dB (to 1.4 kW ERP). It is restored to full power some time during the second. The duration of the reduced power encodes one of three symbols:
* If power is reduced for one-fifth of a second (0.2 s), this is a data bit with value zero.
* If power is reduced for one-half of a second (0.5 s), this is a data bit with value one.
* If power is reduced for four-fifths of a second (0.8 s), this is a special non-data &quot;mark&quot;, used for framing.

Each minute, seven marks are transmitted in a regular pattern which allows the receiver to identify the beginning of the minute and thus the correct framing of the data bits. The other 53 seconds provide data bits which encode the current time, date, and related information.

Before July 12, 2005, when WWVB&#x27;s maximum ERP was 50 kW, the power reduction was 10 dB, resulting in a 5 kW signal. The change to greater modulation depth was part of a series of experiments to increase coverage without increasing transmitter power.

===Phase modulation===
An independent time code is transmitted by binary phase-shift keying of the WWVB carrier. A 1 bit is encoded by inverting the phase (a 180° phase shift) of the carrier for one second. A 0 bit is transmitted with normal carrier phase. The phase shift begins 0.1 s after the corresponding UTC second, so that the transition occurs while the carrier amplitude is low.

The use of phase-shift keying allows a more sophisticated (but still very simple by modern electronics standards) receiver to distinguish 0 and 1 bits far more clearly, allowing improved reception on the East Coast of the United States where the WWVB signal level is weak, radio frequency noise is high, and the MSF time signal from the U.K. interferes at times.

There are no markers as in the amplitude modulated time code. Minute framing is instead provided by a fixed pattern of data bits, transmitted in the last second of each minute and the first 13 seconds of the next one. Because the amplitude-modulated markers provide only 0.2 s of full-strength carrier, it is more difficult to decode their phase modulation. The phase-modulated time code therefore avoids using these bit positions within the minute for important information.

====Allowance for carrier phase tracking receivers====
Added in late 2012, this phase modulation has no effect on popular radio-controlled clocks, which consider only the carrier&#x27;s amplitude, but will cripple (rare) receivers that track the carrier phase.

To allow users of phase tracking receivers time to adjust, the phase-modulated time code was initially omitted twice daily for 30 minutes, beginning at noon and midnight Mountain Standard time (07:00 and 19:00 UTC). This provided enough opportunity for a receiver to lock on to the WWVB carrier phase. This allowance was removed as of March 21, 2013.

===Station ID===
Prior to the addition of the phase-modulated time code, WWVB identified itself by advancing the phase of its carrier wave by 45° at ten minutes past the hour, and returning to normal (a −45° shift) five minutes later. This phase step was equivalent to &quot;cutting and pasting&quot; of a 60 kHz carrier cycle, or approximately 2.08 μs.

This station ID method was common for narrowband high power transmitters in the VLF and LF bands where other intervening factors prevent normal methods of transmitting call letters.

When the phase modulation time code was added in late 2012, this station identification was eliminated; the time code format itself serves as station identification.

==Amplitude-modulated time code==
Each minute, WWVB broadcasts the current time in a binary-coded decimal format.
While this is based on the IRIG timecode, the bit encoding and the order of the transmitted bits differs from any current or past IRIG time distribution standard.
* Markers are sent during seconds 0, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, and 59 of each minute. Thus, the start of the second of two consecutive markers indicates the top of the minute, and serves as the on-time marker for the next frame of time code. Markers are important to allow receivers to properly frame the time code.
* A marker is also sent during leap seconds. In this exceptional event, three consecutive markers will be transmitted: one in second 59, one in second 60, and one in second 0. The start of the third marker indicates the start of the minute.
* There are 11 unused bits, transmitted as binary 0.
* The remaining 42 bits, zeros and ones, carry the binary time code and other information.

The on-time marker, the exact moment which the time code identifies, is the leading (negative-going) edge of the frame reference marker. Thus the time code is always transmitted in the minute immediately after the moment it represents, and matches the hours and minutes of the time of day a clock should be displaying at that moment in UTC (before any time zone or daylight saving offsets are applied).

In the following diagram, the cyan (0 dBr) blocks indicate the full strength carrier, and the dark blue (−17 dBr) blocks indicate the reduced strength carrier. The widest dark blue blocks — the longest intervals (0.8 s) of reduced carrier strength — are the markers, occurring in seconds 0, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, and 59. Of the remaining dark blue blocks, the narrowest represent reduced carrier strength of 0.2 seconds duration, hence data bits of value zero. Those of intermediate width (for example, in seconds :02 and :03) represent reduced carrier strength of 0.5 seconds duration, hence data bits of value one.
The example above encodes the following:
* day 66 (March 6) of 2008
* for the minute beginning at 07:30:00 UTC
* DUT1 is −0.3 seconds (therefore, UT1 is 07:29:59.7)
* DST is not in effect today, nor is it coming into effect
* there is no leap second pending, but the current year &quot;is&quot; a leap year

The table below shows this in more detail, with the &quot;Ex&quot; column being the bits from the example above:
===Announcement bits===
Several bits of the WWVB time code give warning of upcoming events.

Bit 55, when set, indicates that the current year is a leap year and includes February 29. This lets a receiver translate the day number into a month and day according to the Gregorian calendar leap-year rules even though the time code does not include the century.

When a leap second is scheduled for the end of a month, bit 56 is set near the beginning of the month, and reset immediately after the leap second insertion.

The DST status bits indicate United States daylight saving time rules. The bits are updated daily during the minute starting at 00:00 UTC. The first DST bit, transmitted at 57 seconds past the minute, changes at the beginning of the UTC day that DST comes into effect or ends. The other DST bit, at second 58, changes 24 hours later (after the DST change). Therefore, if the DST bits differ, DST is changing at 02:00 local time during the current UTC day. Before the next 02:00 local time after that, the bits will be the same.

Each change in the DST bits will first be received in the mainland United States between 16:00 PST and 20:00 EDT, depending on the local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end. A receiver in the Eastern time zone (UTC−5) must, therefore, correctly receive the &quot;DST is changing&quot; indication within a seven-hour period before DST begins, and six hours before DST ends, if it is to change the local time display at the correct time. Therefore, receivers in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones have one, two, and three more hours of advance notice, respectively.

It is up to the receiving clock to apply the change at the next 02:00 local time if it notices the bits differ. If the receiving clock happens not to receive an update between 00:00 UTC and 02:00 local time the day of the change, it should apply the DST change on the next update after that.

An equivalent definition of the DST status bits is that bit 57 is set if DST will be in effect at 24:00 Z, the end of the current UTC day. Bit 58 is set if DST was in effect at 00:00 Z, the beginning of the current UTC day.

==Phase modulated time code==
The phase-modulated time code has been completely updated and is not related to the amplitude-modulated time code. The only connection is that it is also transmitted in 60 second frames, and the amplitude-modulated markers (when only 20% of the second is transmitted at full strength) are not used for essential time code information.

===One-minute time frames===
The time is transmitted as a 26-bit &quot;minute of century&quot; from 0 to 52595999 (or 52594559 in centuries with only 24 leap years). Like the amplitude-modulated code, the time is transmitted in the minute after the instant it identifies; clocks must increment it for display.

An additional 5 error-correcting bits produce a 31-bit Hamming code that can correct single-bit errors or detect double-bit errors (but not both).

Another field encodes DST and leap-second announcement bits similar to standard WWVB, and a new 6-bit field provides greatly advanced warning of scheduled DST changes.

The 60 bits transmitted each minute are divided as follows:
* 14 fixed sync bits (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)
* 32 bits of time, comprising:
** 26-bit binary minute of century (0–52595999 for 36525 days per century)
** 5 ECC bits, making a Hamming (31,26) code
** 1-bit copy of the least significant bit of the minute
* 5 bits of DST status and leap pending, comprising:
** 2 bits of DST status, as in the amplitude modulated code
** 2 bits (3 possibilities) of leap second warning
** 1 odd parity bit (with one exception, see below)
* 6-bit DST rules code, comprising:
** 2 bits indicating time of next change (1/2/3 o&#x27;clock, or never)
** 3 bits indicating date of change (which Sunday)
** 1 odd parity bit (with one exception, see below)
* 1 bit of &quot;NIST notice&quot;
* 2 reserved bits

A receiver that already knows the time to within a few seconds can synchronize to the fixed synchronization pattern, even when it is unable to distinguish individual time code bits.

The full time code (with the amplitude-modulated code for reference) is transmitted as follows:
Bits within fields are numbered from bit 0 as the least-significant bit; each field is transmitted most significant bit first.

The example shows the time code transmitted on July 4, 2012 between 17:30 and 17:31 UTC. The BCD amplitude code shows a time of 17:30, on day 186 of the year.

The binary time code shows minute of the century. Dividing by 1440 minutes per day, this is minute 1050 of day 4568 of the century. There are in the 12 years before 2012, so this is day 185 of the year. This day number begins at 0 on January 1, rather than 1 like the BCD time code, so it encodes the same date.

===Announcement bits===
The phase-modulated code contains additional announcement bits useful for converting the broadcast UTC to civil time.

In addition to the DST and leap second warning bits found in the amplitude-modulated code, an additional DST schedule field provides several months advance warning of daylight saving time rules.

A final bit, the &quot;notice&quot; bit, indicates that there is an announcement of interest to WWVB users posted at nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/wwvb.cfm.

Two reserved bits are not currently defined, but &quot;not&quot; guaranteed to be zero; note that one of them is transmitted as 1 in the example above.

The DUT1 information (+0.4 s) and leap year indicator bits (2012 is a leap year) in the amplitude modulated code are not included in the phase modulated code; the use of DUT1 for celestial navigation has been obsoleted by satellite navigation.

====DST and leap second warning====
The phase-modulated time code contains daylight saving time announcement and leap second warning information equivalent to the amplitude-modulated code, but they are combined into one 5-bit field for error detection purposes.

There are two DST announcement bits that let a receiver apply U.S. daylight saving time rules:
* dst_on[0] is set if DST was in effect at the beginning of the current UTC day (00:00 UTC).
* dst_on[1] is set if DST will be in effect at the end of the current UTC day (24:00 UTC).

The two bits differ on days when daylight saving time is changing (at 02:00 local time).

There are also three leap second warning possibilities (0, +1, or −1 seconds), making twelve possible values that need to be encoded. Eleven of these are encoded as 5-bit codes with odd parity, providing single-bit error detection (a minimum Hamming distance of 2 between any two valid codes).

Five of the 16 possible odd-parity values (all those differing in one bit from 00011) are not used, and the even-parity value 00011 is used to encode the most common condition: DST in effect, no leap second pending. This provides single-bit error &quot;correction&quot; (a minimum Hamming distance of 3) whenever this code is transmitted.

The above example illustrates this common case: DST is in effect, and no leap second is pending (the last leap second was 4 days ago).

During a leap second, bit 59 (a marker bit with a phase-modulated code of 0) is transmitted again.

====DST schedule====
To extend the few hours&#x27; warning provided by dst_on[1], another 6-bit field encodes the schedule for the next DST change. The encoding is somewhat intricate, but effectively provides 5 bits of information. Three bits supply the date of the change, either 0 to 7 Sundays after the first Sunday in March (when dst_on[1] = 0), or 4 Sundays before to 3 Sundays after the first Sunday in November (when dst_on[1] = 1).

Two more bits encode the time of the change: 1:00, 2:00, or 3:00 AM local time. The fourth combination of these two bits encodes (using the date-of-change bits) several special cases: DST at some other time, DST always off, DST always on, and five reserved codes.

As with the other warning field, most of the assigned 6-bit codes have odd parity, providing a Hamming distance of 2 from each other. However, 6 of the 32 odd-parity codes are not used (all those differing in one bit from 011011), and the even-parity code 011011 is used to encode the most common DST rule (2nd Sunday in March, or 1st Sunday in November) with a Hamming distance of 3.

The five additional reserved codes are assigned to other even-parity code words a Hamming distance of 1 from unlikely DST rule codes.

The example code of 011011 indicates a DST change at 02:00 on the first Sunday in November.

===Message frames===
A small percentage of the time code frames (typically less than 10%) may be replaced by one-minute message frames, containing other information, such as emergency broadcasts.

The details of such frames have not been finalized, but they will begin with an alternate synchronization word (1101000111010, and a 0 during second 59), and include 42 bits of non-time data in the non-marker bits of the time code. Message frames still contain time[0] during second 19 and the notice bit during second 49, so a receiver which knows the time to within ±1 minute can synchronize to them.

Messages are expected to span multiple message frames.

===Six-minute time frames===
For six minutes each half hour, from 10–16 and 40–46 minutes past each hour, one-minute frames are replaced by a special extended time frame. Rather than transmitting 35 bits of information in one minute, this transmits 7 bits (time of day and DST status only) over 6 minutes, giving 30 times as much energy per transmitted bit, a 14.8 dB improvement in the link budget compared to the standard one-minute time code.

The 360-bit code word consists of three parts:
* A 127-bit sequence (generated by a 7-bit linear-feedback shift register), rotated left by a variable amount to encode a value from 0 to 123.
* A 106-bit fixed bit sequence.
* The 127-bit reverse of the initial sequence. Because it is reversed, it is effectively rotated in the opposite direction.

The only information transmitted is the time within the day (one of 48 half hours), plus the current U.S. daylight saving time status, making time codes.

An additional codes are transmitted between 04:10 and 10:46 UTC on days when daylight saving time is changing, providing several hours&#x27; warning of an imminent DST change.

==Propagation==
Since WWVB&#x27;s low frequency signal tends to propagate better along the ground, the signal path from transmitter to the receiver is shorter and less turbulent than WWV&#x27;s shortwave signal, which is strongest when it bounces between the ionosphere and the ground. This results in the WWVB signal having greater accuracy than the WWV signal as received at the same site. Also, since longwave signals tend to propagate much farther at night, the WWVB signal can reach a larger coverage area during that time period, which is why many radio-controlled clocks are designed to automatically synchronize with the WWVB time code during local nighttime hours.

The radiation pattern of WWVB antennas is designed to present a field strength of at least 100 μV/m over most of the continental United States and Southern Canada during some portion of the day. Although this value is well above the thermal noise floor, man-made noise and local interference from a wide range of electronic equipment can easily mask the signal. Positioning receiving antennas away from electronic equipment helps to reduce the effects of local interference.

<doc id="325729" wikidata="Q5370762" url="?curid=325729" title="Emergent democracy">
<text>In politics, emergent democracy represents the rise of political structures and behaviors without central planning and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. It has been likened to the democratic system of ancient Greece in the sense that people could publicly participate as much or as little as they please, although a form of representation exists which is based on personal trust networks instead of party affiliations. More recently, American writer and researcher Clay Shirky has referred to this as &quot;the power of organizing without organizations.&quot;

== Origin ==
Emergent democracy was coined to stand in contrast to more traditional forms of democracy, such as representative democracy and direct democracy. The phrase draws upon emergence theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of termites results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant. Another analogy involves the way a slime mold, a single-celled organism, gathers together to form a super-organism within a specific condition (short supply of food). Emergent democracy is said to work the same way, that once people&#x27;s minds are plugged into the system, collective signal triggers are revealed, resulting result to new ideas and a new way of looking at the world as these minds coalesce.

In the paper that first drew attention to the term, Joi Ito said that the Internet, as a large and decentralized network, will enable innovative responses by citizens to highly complex problems. He described a possibility - in the case of the Internet - to become a method that allows citizens to self-organize so that such problems can be deliberated on and addressed. From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media. Supporters of the idea point to instances in which bloggers have brought about political change by posting about issues that mainstream media had not paid much attention to. The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December 2002 resignation of Trent Lott as Senate majority leader after bloggers publicized his praising of Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 1948 segregationist campaign for the presidency.

== Background ==

Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. &quot;Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues,&quot; he posted. &quot;These words stuck with me and last year I tried to think about blogs and emergent democracy outside of the Japanese context.&quot;
He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by Ross Mayfield. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a conference call that was augmented by IRC chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a wiki for gathering notes from the call. This &quot;multimodal&quot; approach was called a &quot;happening&quot; by Ross Mayfield. The conversation resulted in Ito&#x27;s online article that generated discussions about the potential for weblogs and other social software tools to influence participation in governance. The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. Jon Lebkowsky edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book &quot;Extreme Democracy&quot;. A &quot;teach-in&quot; on that topic was held on February 9, 2004, as part of the O&#x27;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.

<doc id="325733" wikidata="Q2012061" url="?curid=325733" title="Leader of the House of Lords">
<text>The leader of the House of Lords is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom who is responsible for arranging government business in the House of Lords. The post is also the leader of the governing party in the House of Lords who acts as the government party chairperson in the house. The role is always held in combination with a formal Cabinet position, usually one of the sinecure offices of Lord President of the Council, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal or Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Unless the Leader is also a departmental minister, being Leader constitutes the bulk of their government responsibilities, but it has never been an independent salaried office. The Office of the Leader of the House of Lords is a ministerial department.

Though the leader of the House is a member of the cabinet and remains a partisan figure, the leader also has responsibilities to the House as a whole. In contrast to the House of Commons, where proceedings are controlled by the speaker, proceedings in the Lords are controlled by peers themselves, under the rules set out in the Standing Orders. The leader of the House has the responsibility of reminding the House of these rules and facilitating the Lords&#x27; self-regulation, though any member may draw attention to breaches of order or failure to observe customs. The Leader is often called upon to advise on procedures and points of order and is required to determine the order of speakers on Supplementary Questions, subject to the wishes of the House. However, like the Lord Speaker, the Leader of the House has no power to rule on points of order or to intervene during an inappropriate speech.

Until the election of the first Lord Speaker on 4 July 2006, the Leader of the House had responsibility for making preliminary decisions on requests for Private Notice Questions and for waiving the &quot;sub judice&quot; rule in certain cases. Those functions were transferred to the Lord Speaker.

==History==
The title seems to have come into use some time after 1800, as a formal way of referring to the peer who managed government business in the upper House, irrespective of which salaried position they held in the cabinet. However, it may have been used as early as 1689, applied to George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, when he was Speaker of the House of Lords during the Convention Parliament of that year.

The role developed during the first quarter of the eighteenth century, at the same time as the role of Prime Minister and the system of Cabinet government. In the wake of the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution and the succession of the Hanoverians to the throne, Britain evolved a system of government where ministers were sustained in office by their ability to carry legislation through Parliament. It was therefore necessary for a member of the government to take responsibility for steering government legislation through each House.

The Earl of Sunderland initiated aspects of the role during the Whig Junto under Queen Anne. Sunderland and the other Whigs were dismissed from office in reaction to their co-ordination of government matters, which was taken as a threat to the power of the monarch. Sunderland returned to power under George I, as Lord Privy Seal. The first documentary evidence of the existence of the role comes from 1717, when Sunderland became Secretary of State for the Northern Department: in the form of lists of peers invited to the office of the Northern Secretary immediately before sessions of Parliament.

When the Prime Minister sat in the House of Lords, which was common until the beginning of the twentieth century, he usually held the position of Leader of the House of Lords. When the Prime Minister sat in the Commons, the position of Leader of the Lords was often held by the Foreign Secretary or Colonial Secretary. In some coalition governments, it was held by the party leader who was not Prime Minister.

Since the end of the Marquess of Salisbury&#x27;s last government, in 1902, the position clearly exists in its own right as a member of the cabinet. Since 1966 it has only been combined with sinecure positions and the holder has not been a departmental minister though some have held additional responsibilities such as Quintin Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham also being designated &quot;Minister for Science&quot; or Margaret Baroness Jay also being &quot;Minister for Women&quot;. The first female Leader of the Lords was Janet Young, Baroness Young in 1981–1983. Lord Peart, Viscount Whitelaw and Lord Wakeham served as Leader of the Lords having previously been Leader of the House of Commons.

===Families===
* Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury served as Leader of the House of Lords from 1885 to 1886, from 1886 to 1892 and from 1895 to 1902. His son James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury served as Leader from 1925 to 1929. His son in turn, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury served as Leader first from 1942 to 1945 as Viscount Cranborne by means of a writ of acceleration, and as the Marquess of Salisbury from 1951 to 1957. His grandson, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, served as Leader from 1994 to 1997, as Viscount Cranborne, again by means of a writ of acceleration.
* Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham served as Leader of the House of Lords from 1931 to 1935. His son Quintin Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham served as Leader from 1960 to 1963.

==Responsibilities==
*Management and delivery of the Government&#x27;s legislative programme (through the House of Lords) and facilitating the passage of individual bills. 
*Leading the House (in the Chamber and as a key member of domestic committees to do with procedure, conduct, and the internal governance of the House).
*Issues connected to the House of Lords and its governance.
*Speaking for the Government in the Chamber on a range of issues, including repeating in the House of Lords statements made to the Commons by the Prime Minister. 
*Ceremonial and other duties as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal.

==List==
&quot;Because the post is a parliamentary one and not a ministerial office in its own right, it is not always included in official lists of government offices, especially for earlier periods. This can make it difficult to determine who the Leader of the House of Lords was in a particular ministry.&quot;

The following peers have served as Deputy Leaders of the House of Lords since 1963:

<doc id="325735" wikidata="Q370303" url="?curid=325735" title="List of Pomeranian duchies and dukes">
<text>This is a list of the duchies and dukes of [[Pomerania]].

== Dukes of the Slavic Pomeranian tribes (All Pomerania) ==

The lands of Pomerania were firstly ruled by local tribes, who settled in Pomerania around the 10th and 11th centuries.

===Non-dynastic===

In 1106, Pomerania is divided by his two older sons: Wartislaw, who founded the House of Pomerania and the Duchy of Pomerania, and Świętopełk I. After Swietopelk&#x27;s death, his lands were occupied by the Saxon prince Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1155, the lands regained independence under Sobieslaw I, who founded the dynasty of the Samborides, and the Duchy of Pomerelia.

==Duchy of Pomerania==

The Duchy resulted from the partition of Świętobor, Duke of Pomerania, in which his son Wartislaw inherited the lands that would become in fact known as &quot;Pomerania&quot;.
===Partitions of Pomerania===

====First partition 1155–1264====

In 1155, Pomerania was divided in Pomerania-Szczecin and Pomerania-Demmin. In the struggle to shake off Polish and Danish claims to feudal overlordship, Pomerania approached the Holy Roman Empire. In 1181, while staying in the camp outside the walls of Lübeck, Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa recognised Bogislaw I as duke of S(c)lavia, as it was called in the document. However, three years later in the Battle in the Bay of Greifswald (1184) the Danish Canute VI forced Pomerania to accept him as liege lord. In 1190 the Land of Słupsk-Sławno separated itself from Szczecin. With the defeat of Denmark in the Battle of Bornhöved (1227) Pomerania shook off the Danish liege-lordship, except for the city of Szczecin which remained under Danish suzerainty until 1235.

In 1231 Emperor Frederick II granted the immediate liege lordship over Pomerania to the Margrave of Brandenburg, who enforced this claim by the Treaties of Kremmen (1236) and of Landin (1250). Thus Pomerania had become a fief of Brandenburg, thus an only mediate (indirect) subfief of the Empire, with Brandenburg itself being an immediate imperial fief.

In 1227, Słupsk came to Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia) within fragmented Poland, Sławno to Western Pomerania. In 1238 both became part of Pomerelia, ruled by the House of Sobiesław, and following the extinction of the line in 1294, both were directly reintegrated with Poland in accordance with the Treaty of Kępno. In 1317, the area became part of the Pomerania-Wolgast (Wołogoszcz), first as a pawn from Brandenburg, and definitively in 1347.

After Wartislaw III died heirless in 1264, Barnim I became sole duke of the whole duchy. After Barnim&#x27;s death, the duchy was to be ruled by his sons Barnim II, Otto I and Bogislaw IV. The first years, Bogislaw, being the eldest, ruled in place of his too young brothers.

====Second partition 1295–1368====

In 1295, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided roughly by the Peene and Ina rivers, with the areas north of these rivers ruled by Bogislaw IV became Pomerania-Wolgast, whereas Otto I received Pomerania-Szczecin south of these rivers.

====Third partition 1368–1376====

In 1368, Pomerania-Wolgast was divided into a western part (German: &quot;Wolgast diesseits der Swine,&quot; including the name-giving residence in Wolgast) and an eastern part (German: &quot;Wolgast jenseits der Swine,&quot; in literature also called Pomerania-Stolp or Duchy of Słupsk after the residence in Słupsk (Stolp)), which came back under Polish suzerainty as a fief.

==== Fourth partition 1376/1377–1478 and Pomeranian immediacy ====
In 1376, the western part of Pomerania-Wolgast (German: &quot;Wolgast diesseits der Swine&quot;) was subdivided in a smaller western part sometimes named Pomerania-Barth (Bardo) after the residence in Barth, and an eastern part which included the residence in Wolgast. In the following year, the Duchy of Słupsk was divided into a western part which included Stargard and an eastern part which included the residence in Słupsk (Stolp).

In 1459, the eastern partitions of Pomerania-Wolgast around Stargard and Stolp ceased to exist. In 1478, after 200 years of partition, the duchy was reunited for a short period when all her parts were inherited by Bogislaw X. By the Treaty of Pyritz in 1493 Pomerania shook off the Marcher liege lordship and became again an immediate imperial estate, after new disputes finally confirmed by the Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529, both treaties provided Brandenburg succession in case the Pomeranian dukes would become extinct in the male line.

====Fifth and sixth partitions 1531–1625====
In 1531, Pomerania was partitioned into Pomerania-Stettin (Szczecin) and Pomerania-Wolgast. This time however, in contrast to the earlier partitions with the same names, Pomerania-Wolgast included the western, and Pomerania-Stettin the eastern parts of the duchy. In 1569, were created the duchies of -Barth (split off from -Wolgast) and -Rügenwalde (Darłowo) (split off from -Stettin).
====Definitive reunification and annexation to Sweden====

In 1625, Bogislaw XIV reunited all Pomerania under his rule. However, in 1637, Sweden hold western parts of Pomerania (Hither Pomerania), originally including Stettin, legalised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 (Swedish Pomerania, several times reduced in favour of Brandenburgian Pomerania). 
Between 1637 and 1657 Lauenburg-Bütow Land (Lębork and Bytów) were reintegrated directly to Poland as a reverted fief, thereafter passed to Brandenburg under Polish overlordship until the Partitions of Poland. In 1648, Brandenburg prevailed in the Peace of Westphalia with its claim only for eastern parts of Pomerania (Farther Pomerania), with the Brandenburg electors officially holding simultaneously the title of dukes of Pomerania until 1806 (end of the Empire and its enfeoffments), but de facto integrating their Pomerania into Brandenburg-Prussia, making it one of the provinces of Prussia in 1815, then including former Swedish Pomerania.

===Dukes of Pomerania: the House of Griffins===

====Table of rulers====


== Principality of Rugia ==
The Principality was initially a Danish feud, under local rulers, which formed a dynasty.

===House of Wizlaw===

== Duchy of Pomerelia ==

In 1155, the lands which belonged to Świętopełk I were organized by Sobieslaw I into the Duchy of Eastern Pomerania, also known as the Pomerelia, a provincial duchy of fragmented Poland. Sobiesław founded the House of Sobiesław.

The dukes of Pomerelia were using the Latin title &quot;dux Pomeraniae&quot; (&quot;Duke of Pomerania&quot;) or &quot;dux Pomeranorum&quot; (&quot;Duke of the Pomeranians&quot;).

===Partitions of the Duchy of Pomerelia===

In 1215, the duchy was divided in other smaller duchies: Gdańsk, Białogarda, Lubiszewo and Świecie.


In 1271 the duchy is reunited and in 1294 reincorporated directly into Poland per the Treaty of Kępno.

<doc id="325736" wikidata="Q1141430" url="?curid=325736" title="Phenomenalism">
<text>In metaphysics, phenomenalism is the view that physical objects cannot justifiably be said to exist as &quot;things-in-themselves&quot;, but only as perceptual phenomena or sensory stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated in time and in space. In particular, some forms of phenomenalism reduce all talk about physical objects in the external world to talk about &quot;bundles of sense data&quot;.

==History==

Phenomenalism is a radical form of empiricism. Its roots as an ontological view of the nature of existence can be traced back to George Berkeley and his subjective idealism, upon which David Hume further elaborated. John Stuart Mill had a theory of perception which is commonly referred to as classical phenomenalism. This differs from Berkeley&#x27;s idealism in its account of how objects continue to exist when no one is perceiving them. Berkeley claimed that an omniscient God perceived all objects and that this was what kept them in existence, whereas Mill claimed that permanent possibilities of experience were sufficient for an object&#x27;s existence. These permanent possibilities could be analysed into counterfactual conditionals, such as &quot;if I were to have &quot;y&quot;-type sensations, then I would also have &quot;x&quot;-type sensations&quot;.

As an epistemological theory about the possibility of knowledge of objects in the external world, however, the most accessible formulation of phenomenalism is perhaps to be found in the &quot;transcendental idealism&quot; of Immanuel Kant. According to Kant, space and time, which are the &quot;a priori&quot; forms and preconditions of all sensory experience, &quot;refer to objects only to the extent that these are considered as phenomena, but do not represent the things in themselves&quot;. While Kant insisted that knowledge is limited to phenomena, he never denied or excluded the existence of objects which were not knowable by way of experience, the things-in-themselves or noumena, though his proof of noumena had many problems and is one of the most controversial aspects of his Critiques.

Kant&#x27;s &quot;epistemological phenomenalism&quot;, as it has been called, is therefore quite distinct from Berkeley&#x27;s earlier ontological version. In Berkeley&#x27;s view, the so-called &quot;things-in-themselves&quot; do not exist except as subjectively perceived bundles of sensations which are guaranteed consistency and permanence because they are constantly perceived by the mind of God. Hence, while Berkeley holds that objects are merely bundles of sensations (see bundle theory), Kant holds (unlike other bundle theorists) that objects do not cease to exist when they are no longer perceived by some merely &quot;human&quot; subject or mind.

In the late 19th century, an even more extreme form of phenomenalism was formulated by Ernst Mach, later developed and refined by Russell, Ayer and the logical positivists. Mach rejected the existence of God and also denied that phenomena were data experienced by the mind or consciousness of subjects. Instead, Mach held sensory phenomena to be &quot;pure data&quot; whose existence was to be considered anterior to any arbitrary distinction between mental and physical categories of phenomena. In this way, it was Mach who formulated the key thesis of phenomenalism, which separates it from bundle theories of objects: objects are &quot;logical constructions&quot; out of sense-data or ideas; whereas according to bundle theories, objects are made up of sets, or bundles, of &quot;actual&quot; ideas or perceptions.

That is, according to bundle theory, to say that the pear before me exists is simply to say that certain properties (greenness, hardness, etc.) are being perceived at this moment. When these characteristics are no longer perceived or experienced by anyone, then the object (pear, in this case) no longer exists. Phenomenalism as formulated by Mach, in contrast, is the view that objects are &quot;logical constructions&quot; out of perceptual properties. On this view, to say there is a table in the other room when there is no one in that room to perceive it, is to say that &quot;if&quot; there were someone in that room, &quot;then&quot; that person would perceive the table. It is not the &quot;actual&quot; perception that counts, but the conditional &quot;possibility&quot; of perceiving.

Logical positivism, a movement begun as a small circle which grew around the philosopher Moritz Schlick in Vienna, inspired many philosophers in the English speaking world from the 1930s through the 1950s. Important influences on their brand of empiricism included Ernst Mach — himself holding the Chair of Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna, a position Schlick would later hold — and the Cambridge philosopher Bertrand Russell. The idea of some logical positivists, such as A. J. Ayer and Rudolf Carnap, was to apply phenomenalism in linguistic terms, enabling reliable discourse of physical objects, such as tables, in strict terms of either actual or possible sensory experiences.

20th century American philosopher Arthur Danto asserted that &quot;a phenomenalist, believ[es] that whatever is finally meaningful can be expressed in terms of our own [sense] experience.&quot;. He claimed that &quot;The phenomenalist really is committed to the most radical kind of empiricism: For him reference to objects is always finally a reference to sense-experience ... .&quot;

To the phenomenalist, objects of any kind must be related to experience. &quot;John Stuart Mill once spoke of physical objects as but the &#x27;permanent possibility of experience&#x27; and this, by and large, is what the phenomenalist exploits: All we can mean, in talking about physical objects — or nonphysical objects, if there are any — is what experiences we would have in dealing with them ... .&quot; However, phenomenalism is based on mental operations. These operations, themselves, are not known from sense experience. Such non-empirical, non-sensual operations are the &quot;...nonempirical matters of space, time, and continuity that empiricism in all its forms and despite its structures seems to require ... .&quot;

See for comparison Sensualism, to which phenomenalism is closely related.

==Criticisms==
C.I. Lewis had previously suggested that the physical claim &quot;There is a doorknob in front of me&quot; necessarily entails the sensory conditional &quot;If I should seem to see a doorknob and if I should seem to myself to be initiating a grasping motion, then in all probability the sensation of contacting a doorknob should follow&quot;.

Roderick Firth formulated another objection in 1950, stemming from perceptual relativity: White wallpaper looks white under white light and red under red light, etc. Any possible course of experience resulting from a possible course of action will apparently underdetermine our surroundings: it would determine, for example, that there is &quot;either&quot; white wallpaper under red light &quot;or&quot; red wallpaper under white light, and so on.

Another criticism of phenomenalism comes from truthmaker theory. Truthmaker theorists hold that the truth depends on reality. In the terms of truthmaker theory: a truthbearer (e.g. a proposition) is true because of the existence of its truthmaker (e.g. a fact). Phenomenalists have been accused of violating this principle and thereby engaging in &quot;ontological cheating&quot;: of positing truths without being able to account for the truthmakers of these truths. The criticism is usually directed at the phenomenalist account of material objects. The phenomenalist faces the problem of how to account for the existence of unperceived material objects. A well-known solution to this problem comes from John Stuart Mill. He claimed that we can account for unperceived objects in terms of counterfactual conditionals: It is true that valuables locked in a safe remain in existence, despite being unperceived, because if someone were to look inside then this person would have a corresponding sensory impression. Truthmaker theorist may object that this still leaves open what the truthmaker for this counterfactual conditional is, considering it unclear how such a truthmaker could be found within the phenomenalist ontology.

<text>Circle Records is a jazz record label founded in 1946 by Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis.

==History==
In New York, Blesh and Janis heard jazz drummer Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds playing inventive solos with Bunk Johnson&#x27;s band. Blesh said he hated drum solos until he saw Dodds. To record Dodds and others, they started Circle Records. The name was given by fellow audience member Marcel Duchamp.

Circle recorded traditional jazz of the time, and its releases included Chippie Hill, George Lewis, and broadcasts of Blesh&#x27;s &quot;This is Jazz&quot; radio show. The label was the first to release Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s Library of Congress recordings. Blesh and Janis continued the label until 1952. Circle Records also released modern classical music by artists including Henry Cowell and Paul Hindemith.

Circle was bought in the mid-1960s by George H. Buck, Jr. The Circle catalog is now under the control of the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation. Some of the original Circle recordings have been reissued on compact disc through other labels controlled by the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation, including American Music, Southland, and Jazzology.

This Circle Records is not to be confused with the German record label of the same name.

==Selected label discography: 1946–1952==
The first record issued by Circle Records was by the Baby Dodds Trio. Many of their subsequent releases were albums of from two to four 10&quot;, 78 RPM shellac records, issued in a binder. Many of the albums included cover art by Jimmy Ernst or Charles Alston.
==Circle Records today==
Circle Records was reactivated and is used by the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation to release swing music. The reactivated Circle label put out recordings from the Lang-Worth and World transcriptions.

<doc id="325739" wikidata="Q1138992" url="?curid=325739" title="Lucas–Lehmer primality test">
<text>In mathematics, the Lucas–Lehmer test (LLT) is a primality test for Mersenne numbers. The test was originally developed by Édouard Lucas in 1878 and subsequently proved by Derrick Henry Lehmer in 1930.

==The test==
The Lucas–Lehmer test works as follows. Let &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;p&quot; − 1 be the Mersenne number to test with &quot;p&quot; an odd prime. The primality of &quot;p&quot; can be efficiently checked with a simple algorithm like trial division since &quot;p&quot; is exponentially smaller than &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;. Define a sequence formula_1 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 0 by

:formula_2

The first few terms of this sequence are 4, 14, 194, 37634, ... .
Then &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is prime if and only if
:formula_3
The number &quot;s&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 2 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is called the Lucas–Lehmer residue of &quot;p&quot;. (Some authors equivalently set &quot;s&quot;1 = 4 and test &quot;s&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;). In pseudocode, the test might be written as

 // Determine if &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;p&quot; − 1 is prime for &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2
 Lucas–Lehmer(p)
 var s = 4
 var M = 2&quot;p&quot; − 1
 repeat p − 2 times:
 s = ((s × s) − 2) mod M
 if s == 0 return PRIME else return COMPOSITE

Performing the codice_1 at each iteration ensures that all intermediate results are at most &quot;p&quot; bits (otherwise the number of bits would double each iteration). The same strategy is used in modular exponentiation.

===Alternate starting values===

Starting values &quot;s&quot;0 other than 4 are possible, for instance 10, 52, and others . The Lucas-Lehmer residue calculated with these alternative starting values will still be zero if &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is a Mersenne prime. However, the terms of the sequence will be different and a non-zero Lucas-Lehmer residue for non-prime &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; will have a different numerical value from the non-zero value calculated when &quot;s&quot;0 = 4.

It is also possible to use the starting value (2 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;)(3 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;)−1, usually denoted by 2/3 for short. This starting value equals (2p + 1) /3, the Wagstaff number with exponent &quot;p&quot;.

Starting values like 4, 10, and 2/3 are universal, that is, they are valid for all (or nearly all) &quot;p&quot;. There are infinitely many additional universal starting values. However, some other starting values are only valid for a subset of all possible &quot;p&quot;, for example &quot;s&quot;0 = 3 can be used if &quot;p&quot; = 3 (mod 4). This starting value was often used where suitable in the era of hand computation, including by Lucas in proving &quot;M&quot;&quot;127&quot; prime.
The first few terms of the sequence are 3, 7, 47, ... .

===Sign of penultimate term===

If &quot;s&quot;&quot;p&quot;−2 = 0 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; then the penultimate term is &quot;s&quot;&quot;p&quot;−3 = ± 2(&quot;p&quot;+1)/2 mod &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;. The sign of this penultimate term is called the Lehmer symbol ϵ(&quot;s&quot;0, &quot;p&quot;).

In 2000 S.Y. Gebre-Egziabher proved that for the starting value 2/3 and for &quot;p&quot; ≠ 5 the sign is:
:formula_4
That is, ϵ(2/3, &quot;p&quot;) = +1 if &quot;p&quot; = 1 (mod 4) and p ≠ 5.

The same author also proved Woltman&#x27;s conjecture that the Lehmer symbols for starting values 4 and 10 when &quot;p&quot; is not 2 or 5 are related by:
:formula_5
The last step uses formula_6 This closed form is used in both the proof of sufficiency and the proof of necessity.

=== Sufficiency ===

The goal is to show that formula_7 implies that formula_8 is prime. What follows is a straightforward proof exploiting elementary group theory given by J. W. Bruce as related by Jason Wojciechowski.

Suppose formula_3 Then 
:formula_10 
for some integer &quot;k&quot;, so
:formula_11
Multiplying by formula_12 gives
:formula_13
Thus,
:formula_14

For a contradiction, suppose &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is composite, and let &quot;q&quot; be the smallest prime factor of &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;. Mersenne numbers are odd, so &quot;q&quot; &gt; 2. Let formula_15 be the integers modulo &quot;q&quot;, and let formula_16 Multiplication in formula_17 is defined as

:formula_18

Clearly, this multiplication is closed, i.e. the product of numbers from &quot;X&quot; is itself in &quot;X&quot;. The size of &quot;X&quot; is denoted by formula_19

Since &quot;q&quot; &gt; 2, it follows that formula_20 and formula_21 are in &quot;X&quot;. The subset of elements in &quot;X&quot; with inverses forms a group, which is denoted by &quot;X&quot;* and has size formula_22 One element in &quot;X&quot; that does not have an inverse is 0, so formula_23

Now formula_24 and formula_25, so
:formula_26
in &quot;X&quot;.
Then by equation (1), 
:formula_27
in &quot;X&quot;, and squaring both sides gives 
:formula_28 
Thus formula_20 lies in &quot;X&quot;* and has inverse formula_30 Furthermore, the order of formula_20 divides formula_32 However formula_33, so the order does not divide formula_34 Thus, the order is exactly formula_32

The order of an element is at most the order (size) of the group, so
:formula_36 
But &quot;q&quot; is the smallest prime factor of the composite formula_8, so
:formula_38 
This yields the contradiction formula_39. Therefore, formula_8 is prime.

=== Necessity ===

In the other direction, the goal is to show that the primality of formula_8 implies formula_7. The following simplified proof is by Öystein J. Rödseth.

Since formula_43 for odd formula_44, it follows from properties of the Legendre symbol that formula_45 This means that 3 is a quadratic nonresidue modulo formula_46 By Euler&#x27;s criterion, this is equivalent to

:formula_47

In contrast, 2 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_8 since formula_49 and so formula_50 This time, Euler&#x27;s criterion gives

:formula_51

Combining these two equivalence relations yields

:formula_52

Let formula_53, and define &quot;X&quot; as before as the ring formula_54 Then in the ring &quot;X&quot;, it follows that

:formula_55

where the first equality uses the Binomial Theorem in a finite field, which is

: formula_56,

and the second equality uses Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, which is

: formula_57

for any integer &quot;a&quot;. The value of formula_58 was chosen so that formula_59 Consequently, this can be used to compute formula_60 in the ring &quot;X&quot; as

:formula_61

All that remains is to multiply both sides of this equation by formula_62 and use formula_63, which gives

:formula_64

Since formula_65 is 0 in &quot;X&quot;, it is also 0 modulo formula_46

== Applications ==

The Lucas–Lehmer test was the main primality test used by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) to locate large primes until 2021. This search has been successful in locating many of the largest primes known to date. In 2021, GIMPS switched to an even faster variant of Fermat&#x27;s primality test for locating probable Mersenne primes, and only uses Lucas-Lehmer to verify these probable primes as actual primes.

The test is considered valuable because it can provably test a large set of very large numbers for primality within an affordable amount of time. In contrast, the equivalently fast Pépin&#x27;s test for any Fermat number can only be used on a much smaller set of very large numbers before reaching computational limits.

<text>The division of Korea &quot;de facto&quot; began on 2 September 1945, when Japan signed the surrender document, thus ending the Pacific Theater of World War II. It was officially divided with the establishment of the two Koreas in 1948. During World War II, the Allied leaders had already been considering the question of Korea&#x27;s future following Japan&#x27;s eventual surrender in the war. The leaders reached an understanding that Korea would be liberated from Japan but would be placed under an international trusteeship until the Koreans would be deemed ready for self-rule. In the last days of the war, the United States proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones (a U.S. and Soviet one) with the 38th parallel as the dividing line. The Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea, which led to the declaration of General Order No. 1.

It was understood that this division was only a temporary arrangement until the trusteeship could be implemented. In December 1945, the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers resulted in an agreement on a five-year, four-power Korean trusteeship. However, with the onset of the Cold War and other factors both international and domestic, including Korean opposition to the trusteeship, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union over the next two years regarding the implementation of the trusteeship failed, thus effectively nullifying the only agreed-upon framework for the re-establishment of an independent and unified Korean state. With this, the Korean question was referred to the United Nations. In 1948, after the UN failed to produce an outcome acceptable to the Soviet Union, UN-supervised elections were held in the US-occupied south only. Syngman Rhee won the election, while Kim Il Sung consolidated his position as the leader of Soviet-occupied northern Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in southern Korea on 15 August 1948, promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea in northern Korea on 9 September 1948. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula.

On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea in an attempt to re-unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and has left Korea divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) up to the present day.

During the April 2018 inter-Korean summit, the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted between Kim Jong Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, and Moon Jae-in, the President of South Korea. During the September 2018 inter-Korean summit, several actions were taken toward reunification along the border, such as the dismantling of guard posts and the creation of buffer zones to prevent clashes. On 12 December 2018, soldiers from both Koreas crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into the opposition countries for the first time in history.

In October 2024, the North Korean constitution was amended to remove references to reunification and labelled South Korea a &quot;hostile state&quot;. This was preceded by the destruction of roads connecting the north to the south in a bid to &quot;completely separate&quot; the two states.

==Historical background==
===Japanese rule (1910–1945)===

When the Russo-Japanese War ended in 1905, Korea (then the Korean Empire) became a nominal protectorate of Japan and was annexed by Japan in 1910. Emperor Gojong was removed. In the following decades, nationalist and radical groups emerged to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to come together in one national movement. The Korean Provisional Government (KPG) in exile in China failed to obtain widespread recognition.

===World War II===

At the Cairo Conference in November 1943, in the middle of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force. At the end of the conference, the three powers declared that they were &quot;mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.&quot; Roosevelt floated the idea of a trusteeship over Korea but did not obtain agreement from the other powers. Roosevelt raised the idea with Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945. Stalin did not disagree but advocated that the period of trusteeship be short.

At the Tehran and Yalta Conferences, Stalin promised to join his allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe. On 8 August 1945, two days after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, but before the second bomb was dropped at Nagasaki, the USSR declared war on Japan. As war began, the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East, Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky, called on Koreans to rise up against Japan, saying &quot;a banner of liberty and independence is rising in Seoul&quot;.

Soviet troops advanced rapidly, and the U.S. government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On 10 August 1945 two young officers – Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel – were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a &quot;National Geographic&quot; map to decide on the 38th parallel as the dividing line. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he &quot;almost surely&quot; would have chosen a different line. The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone. Rusk observed, &quot;even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement ... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops&quot;. He noted that he was &quot;faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area&quot;. To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division. The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.

=== Liberation, confusion, and conflict ===
On 10 August, Soviet forces entered northern Korea. Soviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by 14 August and rapidly took over the northeast of the country, and on 16 August they landed at Wonsan. Japanese resistance was light, and Soviet forces secured most major cities in the north by 24 August (including Pyongyang, the second largest city in the Korean Peninsula after Seoul). Having fought Japan on Korean soil, the Soviet forces were well-received by Koreans. 

Throughout August, there was a mix of celebration, confusion, and conflict, mainly caused by the lack of information provided to the Koreans by the Allies. The general public did not become aware of the division of Korea until around when the Soviets entered Pyongyang.

Meanwhile in Seoul, beginning in early to mid August, General Nobuyuki Abe, the last Japanese Governor-General of Korea, began contacting Koreans to offer them a leading role in the hand-over of power. He first offered the position to Song Jin-woo, the former head of &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot; newspaper, who was seen as a champion of Korean independence activism within the peninsula. Song refused the position, which he saw as equivalent to the role of Wang Jingwei, the ruler of the Japanese puppet state in China. He instead preferred to wait until, as many expected and hoped, the KPG returned to the peninsula and established a fully domestic Korean government. On 15 August, Abe instead offered the position to Lyuh Woon-hyung, who accepted it, to the chagrin of Song. That day, Lyuh announced to the public that Japan had accepted the terms of surrender laid out in the Potsdam Declaration, to the jubilation of the Koreans and the horror of the around 777,000 Japanese residents of the peninsula. With a budget of 20,000,000 yen from the colonial government, Lyuh set about organizing the (CPKI). The CPKI began taking over the security situation in the city and coordinating with local governments throughout the peninsula. However, the organization ended up being composed of mostly left-leaning communists, which infuriated Song even more. Lyuh attempted on multiple occasions to convince Song to join or support the CPKI, but their meetings reportedly ended in angry arguments each time.

For the weeks before the American arrival in Seoul, the capital was awash with waves of rumors, some of which may have been spread by Japanese soldiers to distract the public while they prepared to leave the peninsula. On multiple occasions, rumors that Soviet soldiers were about to arrive via rail to Seoul caused either mass panic or, for some left-leaning Koreans, celebration. Even the Soviet Ambassador in Seoul was confused and phoned around to check whether Soviet soldiers were coming. Another rumor, spread both by fliers and a pirate radio broadcast, alleged the creation of a &quot;Dongjin Republic&quot; (), with Syngman Rhee as president, Kim Ku as prime minister, Kim Il Sung as minister of military affairs, and Lyuh as foreign minister.

On 16 August, young officers of the Japanese military in Seoul fiercely protested the decisions of the colonial government. Despite assurances from the colonial government to the CPKI of minimal interference from the Japanese in their affairs, the military declared that they would firmly punish any unrest, to the protest of the CPKI.

On 6 September a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short-lived People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (PRK). In the spirit of consensus, conservative elder statesman Syngman Rhee, who was living in exile in the U.S., was nominated as president. Song announced his own (NFPC) on 7 September to directly counter the PRK. However, the NFPC had a minimal role in Korean politics and ended up aligning itself with the KPG after its return.

==Post–World War II==
===Division (since 2 September 1945)===

====Soviet occupation of northern Korea====

The Soviets received little resistance from the Japanese during their advance across northern Korea and were aided by various Korean groups. When Soviet troops entered Pyongyang on August 24, they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist Cho Man-sik. The Soviet Army allowed these &quot;People&#x27;s Committees&quot; (which were of varying political composition) to function. In September 1945, the Soviet administration issued its own currency, the &quot;Red Army won&quot;.

As a result of the destruction caused to the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the Soviets lacked the resources and will to create a full satellite state in Korea and Koreans enjoyed a higher level of autonomy than Soviet-controlled Eastern European states. The Soviets had brought with them a number of Koreans who had been living in the Soviet Union, some of whom were members of the Soviet Communist Party, with the intention of creating a socialist state. Unlike in the south, the former Japanese occupying authorities offered virtually no assistance to the Soviets, and even destroyed factories, mines and official records.

After the massive loss of troops in Europe, the Soviet army recruited new soldiers, who were badly equipped when they landed in Korea, some even lacking shoes and uniforms. During the Soviet occupation, they lived off the Korean land, and looted Japanese colonials and Korean capitalists, sending part of the loot back home. In addition to looting, Soviet soldiers were accused of rape, although the accusations were inflated in the south by fleeing Japanese colonials. Korean peasants sometimes joined the looting, indicating that the looting was based in class disparities, rather than racial disparities. These abuses lessened after the arrival of military police in January 1946. On the southern peninsula, American soldiers also committed depredations, both rape and looting, on a smaller scale than the Soviets. The racism amongst Americans against Koreans, however, was widespread.

In 1946, Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov took charge of the administration and began to lobby the Soviet government for funds to support the ailing economy. Shtykov&#x27;s strong support of Kim Il Sung, who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in Manchuria, was decisive in his rise to power. In February 1946 a provisional government called the Provisional People&#x27;s Committee of North Korea was formed under Kim Il Sung. Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants manoeuvred to gain positions of power in the new government.

In December 1946, Shtykov and two other generals designed the election results of the Assembly for the Provisional Committee without any Korean input. The generals decided &quot;exact distribution of seats among the parties, the number of women members, and, more broadly, the precise social composition of the legislature.&quot; The original 1948 North Korean constitution was primarily written by Stalin and Shtykov.

In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land-reform program: land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers. Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural labourers under the people&#x27;s committees, a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes. Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land, thereby making for a far more equal distribution of land. The North Korean land reform was achieved in a less violent way than in China or in Vietnam. Official American sources stated: &quot;From all accounts, the former village leaders were eliminated as a political force without resort to bloodshed, but extreme care was taken to preclude their return to power.&quot; The farmers responded positively; many collaborators, former landowners and Christians fled to the south, where some of them obtained positions in the new South Korean government. According to the U.S. military government, 400,000 northern Koreans went south as refugees.

Key industries were nationalized. The economic situation was nearly as difficult in the north as it was in the south, as the Japanese had concentrated agriculture and service industries in the south and heavy industry in the north.

Soviet forces were withdrawn on 10 December 1948.

====US occupation of southern Korea====

With the American government fearing Soviet expansion, and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum, the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times. On 7 September 1945, General Douglas MacArthur issued Proclamation No. 1 to the people of Korea, announcing U.S. military control over Korea south of the 38th parallel and establishing English as the official language during military control. That same day, he announced that Lieutenant General John R. Hodge was to administer Korean affairs. Hodge landed in Incheon with his troops on 8 September 1945, marking the beginning of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK).

MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ended up being in charge of southern Korea from 1945 to 1948 due to the lack of clear orders or initiative from Washington, D.C. There was no plan or guideline given to MacArthur from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State Department on how to rule Korea. Hodge directly reported to MacArthur and GHQ (General Headquarters) in Tokyo, not to Washington, D.C., during the military occupation. The three year period of the U.S. Army occupation was chaotic and tumultuous compared to the very peaceful and stable U.S. occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952. Hodge and his XXIV Corps were trained for combat, not for diplomacy and negotiating with the many diverse political groups that emerged in post-colonial southern Korea: former Japanese collaborators, pro-Soviet communists, anti-Soviet communists, right wing groups, and Korean nationalists. None of the Americans in the military or the State Department in the Far East in late 1945 even spoke Korean, leading to jokes among Koreans that Korean translators were really running southern Korea. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them. Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of Korea and its People&#x27;s Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.

Japanese civilians were repatriated, including nearly all industrial managers and technicians; over 500,000 by December 1945 and 786,000 by August 1946. Severe price inflation occurred in the disrupted economy, until in summer 1946 rationing and price controls were imposed.

In September 1946, thousands of laborers and peasants rose up against the military government. This uprising was quickly defeated, and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly. The opening of the Assembly was delayed to December to investigate widespread allegations of electoral fraud.

Ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US, became the most prominent politician in the South. Rhee pressured the American government to abandon negotiations for a trusteeship and create an independent Republic of Korea in the south. On 19 July 1947, Lyuh Woon-hyung, the last senior politician committed to left-right dialogue, was assassinated by a 19-year-old man named Han Chigeun, a recent refugee from North Korea and an active member of the nationalist right-wing group, the White Shirts Society.

USAMGIK and later the newly formed South Korean government faced a number of left-wing insurgencies, some supported by North Korea, that were eventually suppressed. Over the course of the next few years, between 30,000 and 100,000 people were killed. Most casualties resulted from the Jeju Uprising.

===US–Soviet Joint Commission===

In December 1945, at the Moscow Conference, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union, the US, the Republic of China, and Britain would take part in a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. This invigorated the , which demanded the immediate independence of the peninsula. However, the Korean Communist Party, which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party, supported the trusteeship. According to historian Fyodor Tertitskiy, documentation from 1945 suggests the Soviet government initially had no plans for a permanent division.

A met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration, but failed to make progress due to increasing Cold War antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship. In 1946, the Soviet Union proposed Lyuh Woon-hyung as the leader of a unified Korea, but this was rejected by the US. Meanwhile, the division between the two zones deepened. The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics, and a transfer of population between North and South. In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit. At the final meeting of the Joint Commission in September 1947, Soviet delegate Terentii Shtykov proposed that both Soviet and US troops withdraw and give the Korean people the opportunity to form their own government. This was rejected by the US.

===UN intervention and the formation of separate governments===


With the failure of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US brought the problem before the United Nations in September 1947. The Soviet Union opposed UN involvement. The UN passed a resolution on 14 November 1947, declaring that free elections should be held, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and a UN commission for Korea, the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK), should be created. The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections. In the absence of Soviet co-operation, it was decided to hold UN-supervised elections in the south only. This was in defiance of the report of the chairman of the commission, K. P. S. Menon, who had argued against a separate election. Some UNTCOK delegates felt that the conditions in the south gave unfair advantage to right-wing candidates, but they were overruled.

The decision to proceed with separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly saw it as a prelude to a permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948. In April, Jeju islanders rose up against the looming division of the country and full-scale rebellion developed. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. The repression of the uprising escalated from August 1948, following South Korean independence. The rebellion was largely defeated by May 1949 and 25,000 to 30,000 people had been killed in the conflict, and 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops. The uprising flared up again with the outbreak of the Korean War.

In April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in Pyongyang. The southern politicians Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties. The conference called for a united government and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Syngman Rhee and General Hodge denounced the conference. Kim Koo was assassinated the following year.

On 10 May 1948 the south held a general election. It took place amid widespread violence and intimidation, as well as a boycott by opponents of Syngman Rhee. On 15 August, the &quot;Republic of Korea&quot; (&quot;Daehan Minguk&quot;) formally took over power from the U.S. military, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. USAMGIK was formally dissolved and the Korean Military Advisory Group was formed to train and provide support for the South Korean army. U.S forces started to withdraw in a process that was completed by 1949. In the North, the &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; (&quot;Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk&quot;) was declared on 9 September, with Kim Il Sung as prime minister.

On 12 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the report of UNTCOK and declared the Republic of Korea to be the &quot;only lawful government in Korea&quot;. However, none of the members of UNTCOK considered that the election had established a legitimate national parliament. The Australian government, which had a representative on the commission declared that it was &quot;far from satisfied&quot; with the election.

Unrest continued in the South. In October 1948, the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion took place, in which some regiments rejected the suppression of the Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government. In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the Bodo League in order to keep an eye on its political opponents. The majority of the Bodo League&#x27;s members were innocent farmers and civilians who were forced into membership. The registered members or their families were executed at the beginning of the Korean War. On 24 December 1949, South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers or their family and affixed blame to communists.

==Korean War==

This division of Korea, after more than a millennium of being unified, was seen as controversial and temporary by both regimes. From 1948 until the start of the civil war on 25 June 1950, the armed forces of each side engaged in a series of bloody conflicts along the border. In 1950, these conflicts escalated dramatically when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering the Korean War. The United Nations intervened to protect the South, sending a US-led force. As it occupied the south, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea attempted to unify Korea under its regime, initiating the nationalisation of industry, land reform, and the restoration of the People&#x27;s Committees.

While UN intervention was conceived as restoring the border at the 38th parallel, Syngman Rhee argued that the attack of the North had obliterated the boundary. Similarly UN Commander in Chief, General Douglas MacArthur stated that he intended to unify Korea, not just drive the North Korean forces back behind the border. However, the North overran 90% of the south until a counter-attack by US-led forces. As the North Korean forces were driven from the south, South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel on 1 October, and American and other UN forces followed a week later. This was despite warnings from the People&#x27;s Republic of China that it would intervene if American troops crossed the parallel. As it occupied the north, the Republic of Korea, in turn, attempted to unify the country under its regime, with the Korean National Police enforcing political indoctrination. As US-led forces pushed into the north, China unleashed a counter-attack which drove them back into the south.

In 1951, the front line stabilized near the 38th parallel, and both sides began to consider an armistice. Rhee, however, demanded the war continue until Korea was unified under his leadership. The Communist side supported an armistice line being based on the 38th parallel, but the United Nations supported a line based on the territory held by each side, which was militarily defensible. The UN position, formulated by the Americans, went against the consensus leading up to the negotiations. Initially, the Americans proposed a line that passed through Pyongyang, far to the north of the front line. The Chinese and North Koreans eventually agreed to a border on the military line of contact rather than the 38th parallel, but this disagreement led to a tortuous and drawn-out negotiating process.

==Armistice==
The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed after three years of war. The two sides agreed to create a buffer zone between the states, known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This new border, reflecting the territory held by each side at the end of the war, crossed the 38th parallel diagonally. Rhee refused to accept the armistice and continued to urge the reunification of the country by force. Despite attempts by both sides to reunify the country, the war perpetuated the division of Korea and led to a permanent alliance between South Korea and the U.S., and a permanent U.S. garrison in the South.

As dictated by the terms of the Korean Armistice, a Geneva Conference was held in 1954 on the Korean question. Despite efforts by many of the nations involved, the conference ended without a declaration for a unified Korea.

The Armistice established a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) which was tasked to monitor the Armistice. Since 1953, members of the Swiss and Swedish armed forces have been members of the NNSC stationed near the DMZ. Poland and Czechoslovakia were the neutral nations chosen by North Korea, but North Korea expelled their observers after those countries embraced capitalism.

==Post-armistice relations==
Since the war, Korea has remained divided along the DMZ. North and South have remained in a state of conflict, with the opposing regimes both claiming to be the legitimate government of the whole country. Sporadic negotiations have failed to produce lasting progress towards reunification.

On 27 April 2018 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Panmunjom Declaration signed by both leaders called for the end of longstanding military activities near the border and the reunification of Korea. 

On 1 November 2018, buffer zones were established across the DMZ to help ensure the end of hostility on land, sea and air. The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea. In addition, no fly zones were established.

<text>Crescent Records was an American independent record label that produced jazz recordings from 1944 to 1946. It was founded by Nesuhi Ertegun to record a band that was assembled to perform on CBS Radio&#x27;s 1944 variety series &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;. Only one group, Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, was released on the Crescent label, which was distributed by Hollywood&#x27;s Jazz Man Record Shop. Although only eight discs were released, Crescent Records was involved in the international revival of traditional jazz in the 1940s.

==History==


Crescent Records was founded by Nesuhi Ertegun in 1944, with the express purpose of recording the All Star Jazz Group featured on the CBS Radio program, &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;. Ertegun produced the four recording sessions; the label was owned by Marili Morden, proprietor of the Jazz Man Record Shop in Hollywood. Only eight discs were released on the Crescent label, all of them made by the group Ertegun renamed Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band.

The All Star Jazz Group was founded in February 1944 by Marili Morden at the request of Orson Welles. A passionate and knowledgeable fan of traditional jazz, Welles wanted an authentic New Orleans jazz band for his weekly variety show on CBS Radio. Within minutes Morden assembled Mutt Carey (trumpet), Ed Garland (bass), Kid Ory (trombone), Bud Scott (guitar), Zutty Singleton (drums), Buster Wilson (piano), and Jimmie Noone (clarinet, replaced by Barney Bigard after Noone&#x27;s death). The All Star Jazz Group first performed on &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot; March 15, 1944; its last performance was July 12, 1944, on the penultimate show in the series. Their performances on the Welles show were so popular that the band became a regular feature, launched Ory&#x27;s comeback, and was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz.

&quot;Viewed in perspective,&quot; Ertegun later wrote, &quot;they are among the most significant jazz records ever made: they gave eloquent proof of the continuing vitality of New Orleans jazz at a time when such proof was needed. They also revealed that Kid Ory&#x27;s trombone was more powerful and more exuberant than it had ever been before, and that the master from New Orleans was still improving after a life almost as long as the life of jazz.&quot;

Ertegun retired the Crescent label after he purchased Jazz Man Records in late 1946. The eight Crescent discs were reissued on the Jazz Man Records label (Jazz Man 21–28) between 1946 and 1947. On January 15, 1952, Good Time Jazz Records purchased the Crescent masters and the rest of the Jazz Man catalog for $5,500. The Crescent recordings were reissued on Good Time Jazz Records L-10 and L-11 (1953) and L-12022 (1957).

<doc id="325750" wikidata="Q333350" url="?curid=325750" title="Michael Havers, Baron Havers">
<text>Robert Michael Oldfield Havers, Baron Havers, (10 March 1923 – 1 April 1992), was a British barrister and Conservative politician. He was knighted in 1972 and appointed a life peer in 1987.

== Early life and military service ==
Havers was born in North Sheen in 1923, the second son of High Court judge Sir Cecil Havers and Enid Flo Havers, &quot;née&quot; Snelling. He was the brother of Baroness Butler-Sloss (born 1933) who in 1988 became the first woman named to the Court of Appeal and later President of the Family Division.

He was educated at Westminster School, before joining the Royal Navy in 1941 during the Second World War. He served as a 19-year-old midshipman on HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; attached to Force Q in the Mediterranean. On 10 September 1943, he was promoted from temporary acting sub-lieutenant to temporary sub-lieutenant. Following the end of the war, he transferred to the permanent Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve during April 1947 in the rank of lieutenant seniority from 1 August 1945.

After demobilization, he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1946, where he read law.

==Legal career==
Havers was called to the bar in 1948 and undertook his pupillage in the chambers of Fred Lawton, as the pupil of Gerald Howard. Havers was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1964. He was the Recorder of Dover from 1962 to 1968 and Recorder of Norwich from 1968 to 1971. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1971.

==Political career==
Havers was elected to the House of Commons representing Wimbledon in 1970, a seat he held until 1987. He served as Solicitor General under Edward Heath from 1972 to 1974. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1977. He served as Attorney-General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland from 1979 to 1987 under Margaret Thatcher; his was the longest unbroken tenure of the office since the eighteenth century. During the Falklands War, Havers was included in Thatcher&#x27;s War Cabinet, to which he provided advice on international law and rules of engagement.

In June 1987 he was appointed Lord Chancellor and consequently became a life peer as Baron Havers, of St Edmundsbury in the County of Suffolk, the last to be ennobled upon appointment. However, he was forced to resign that October, due to ill health.

==Controversy==
===Yorkshire Ripper trial===
In May 1981, at the beginning of the trial of Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The basis of this defence was his claim that he was the tool of God&#x27;s will. Sutcliffe first claimed to have heard voices while working as a gravedigger, that ultimately ordered him to kill prostitutes. He said the voices originated from a headstone of a deceased Polish man, Bronislaw Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God.

He also pleaded guilty to seven counts of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe&#x27;s plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. However, the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour submission by Havers, the Attorney-General, a 90-minute lunch break and a further 40 minutes of legal discussion, Justice Boreham rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the four psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.

Havers drew controversy at the outset of the trial, when he said of Sutcliffe&#x27;s victims in his introductory speech: &quot;Some were prostitutes, but perhaps the saddest part of the case is that some were not. The last six attacks were on totally respectable women.&quot; In response to this remark, the English Collective of Prostitutes accused Havers of &quot;condoning the murder of prostitutes&quot;, and women demonstrated outside the Old Bailey with placards in protest.

The trial lasted a fortnight and, despite the efforts of his counsel James Chadwin, QC, Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment.

===Role in the Guildford Four and Maguire family miscarriages of justice===
Havers represented the Crown in two high-profile Troubles-related miscarriages of justice in British judicial history: the trial and appeal of the Guildford Four and also of the Maguire family (known as the Maguire Seven), all of whom were wrongfully convicted. Collectively, they served a total of 113 years in prison. One of the Maguire Seven, Giuseppe Conlon, died in prison, convicted on the basis of discredited forensic evidence.

In the case of the Guildford Four, the Director of Public Prosecutions was found to have suppressed alibi evidence that supported Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill&#x27;s claims of innocence. The Director of Public Prosecutions, for which Havers was acting, was also found to have suppressed confessions by Provisional IRA bombers, known as the Balcombe Street Gang, claiming responsibility for the Guildford and Woolwich bombings.

In his submission to Sir John May&#x27;s Inquiry into the Guildford and Woolwich bombings in 1989, Labour MP Chris Mullin cast doubt on Havers&#x27;s integrity in the matter:
Sir Michael Havers represented the Crown at the trials of the Guildford Four, Mrs. Maguire and her family and at the re-trial/appeal of the Guildford Four. He is, therefore, probably the person who can lay claim to the most detailed knowledge of this affair. I respectfully submit that any inquiry that passed without the benefit of his experience would be deficient...
The only hope of sustaining the original convictions was to rewrite the script from top to bottom. This Sir Michael and his colleagues proceeded to do with ingenuity and relish.
==Personal life==
Havers married Carol Elizabeth Lay in 1949, with whom he had two sons: Philip Havers, who became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel like his father, and the actor Nigel Havers. Havers was a member of the Garrick Club.

The house at Gothic Lodge, Woodhayes Road, Wimbledon, where Sir Michael and Lady Havers had an apartment, was bombed by the Provisional IRA on 13 November 1981; Havers and his family were in Spain at the time of the attack. A police constable standing guard outside the house was taken to hospital suffering from shock. A master at King&#x27;s College School, Frank Miles, was in bed in his apartment in the same house, and was unhurt because he had left his sitting room. When discovered, Miles was described as &#x27;like Lear in the storm scene&#x27;; he took a bottle of champagne into school the next day, to celebrate his deliverance with his pupils. 

Havers had two heart bypass operations in the 1980s. On 1 April 1992, he died from heart failure at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London at the age of 69, after falling ill while working in his office.

<text>Hadhramaut (, ; , ) is a geographic region in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula which includes the Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Shabwa and al-Mahra, as well as Aden, Abyan and Lahij. Some sources also include Dhofar Governorate, in southwestern Oman, and Shaurah, in Najran Province, in southern Saudi Arabia. The name is of ancient origin, and is reflected in the name of the Yemeni Governorate of Hadhramaut. The people of Hadhramaut are called the &quot;Hadharem&quot;. They formerly spoke Hadramautic, an old South Arabian language, but they now predominantly speak Hadhrami Arabic.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of &quot;Ḥaḍramawt&quot; is not exactly known, and there are numerous debated hypotheses regarding its meaning. The most popular folk etymology is that the word means &quot;death has come&quot;, from the or also .

The name Ḥaḍramawt has also been found within Biblical Hazarmaveth (; Genesis 10:26 and 1 Chronicles 1:20). There, it is the name of a son of Joktan, identified as Qahtan (southern Arab) in Islam, the purported ancestor and progenitor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name &quot;Hazarmaveth&quot; means &quot;court of death&quot;, reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.

Though the origins of the name are unknown, there are several scholarly proposals. Kamal Salibi says that the diphthong &quot;-aw&quot; is an incorrect vocalisation, noting that &quot;-ūt&quot; is a frequent ending for place names in the Ḥaḍramawt; given that &quot;Ḥaḍramūt&quot; is the colloquial pronunciation of the name, and also its ancient pronunciation, the correct reading of the name would thus be &quot;place of &quot;ḥḍrm&quot;&quot;. Salibi proposes, then, that the name means &quot;the green place&quot;, which is appropriate given its well-irrigated wadis, giving a lushness that contrasts with the surrounding high desert plateau.

A now-rejected etymology was proposed by Juris Zarins, the twentieth-century discoverer of the city, who claimed it to be the ancient incense trade route capital Ubar in Oman, also called the &quot;Atlantis of the Sands&quot;. He also claimed that the name may come from the Greek word , i.e. enclosed (and often fortified), referring to watering stations within the wadis. Though it accurately describes the configuration of settlements in the pre-Islamic Wadi Ḥaḍramawt, this explanation for the name is anachronistic and phonetically inconsistent; for example, the name contains pharyngeal fricatives, which are neither found nor substituted-for in existing Greek speech.

Variations of the name are attested-to as early as the middle of the 1st millennium BC. The names &quot;ḥḍrmt&quot; (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩩) and &quot;ḥḍrmwt&quot; (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩥𐩩) are found in texts of the Old South Arabian languages (Ḥaḍramitic, Minaic, Qatabanic and Sabaic), though the second form is not found in any known Ḥaḍramitic inscriptions. In either form, the word itself can be a toponym, a tribal name, or the name of the kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt. In the late fourth or early 3rd century BC, Theophrastus gives the name , a direct transcription of the Semitic name into Greek.

==History==

===Ancient===


The Kingdom of Hadramout existed before the birth of Christ, but its exact date of founding cannot be confirmed. Its capital was Shabwa, not far from the city of Teman (the capital of the Kingdom of Qataban), a tribal federation consisting of several tribes united by their common veneration of the lunar god Sin; Hadramout was originally the name of one of the tribes. The mention of Hadramout and its god Sin is found in the inscription of Surwah by the Makrib Sabean writer Karib&#x27;il Watar I around 700–680 BCE.
The Kingdom, led by King Shahr-al-Khuraymat, formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Ma&#x27;in and the Kingdom of Qataban and became independent from the Kingdom of Sheba around 330 BCE, during which the Himyarite dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Sheba. The relationship between the Kingdom of Hadramout and the Himyarite Kingdom remained tense, with both sides waging wars against each other for control of the trade routes and territory in the region.

The Hadhrami are referred to as Chatramotitai in ancient Greek texts. Hadhramautic texts come later than Sabaean ones, and some Sabaean texts from Hadhramaut are known. Greek, Latin, Sabaean and Hadhramautic texts preserve the names of a large number of kings of Hadhramaut, but there is as yet no definitive chronology of their reigns. Their capital was Shabwa in the northwest corner of the kingdom, along the Incense trade route. Eratosthenes called it a &quot;metropolis&quot;. It was an important cult centre as well. At first, the religion was South Arabian polytheism, distinguished by the worship of the Babylonian moon god Sin. By the sixth century, the monotheistic cult of Rahmanan was followed in the local temple.

The political history of Hadhramaut is not easy to piece together. Numerous wars involving Hadhramaut are referenced in Sabaean texts. From their inscriptions, the Hadhrami are known to have fortified Libna (now ) against Himyar and to have fortified (&quot;Ḥiṣn al-Ghurāb&quot; ) against the Kingdom of Aksum in the period following the death of Dhū Nuwās (525/7). The kingdom ceased to exist by the end of the 3rd century CE, having been annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom. Hadhramaut continued to be used in the full titulature of the kings of Sabaʾ and Dhu Raydān (Himyar).

In the 2nd century CE, Hadramout was known for its frankincense and myrrh trade. The incense trade route (southern incense route) that passed through the southern part of Hadramout helped the region flourish economically and culturally. The Kingdom of Hadramout played a significant role in connecting the cultures of Arabia, Mesopotamia, East Africa, and the Roman Empire.

===Islamic===
In the 7th century, Islam spread to Hadramout, and it was gradually integrated into the Caliphate. The region played a role in Islamic history during the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate. In the 11th century, the Hadramout region came under the rule of the Mahdids, who were of Banu Hadhrami origin. They established the Qasimi dynasty, which ruled the region for several centuries.

Early Islamic authors believed the nomadic Kinda tribe that founded a kingdom in central Arabia were originally from Hadhramaut, although distinct from the settled Hadhrami population.

Miqdad ibn Aswad, a companion of Muhammad, was reportedly from Hadhramaut. Several prophets before them are believed to have dwelt here, including Hud of ʿĀd. He is thought to be buried at Qabr Hud, which is also called &quot;Shiʿb Hud&quot;, but this is not universally accepted.

===Portuguese and Ottoman Influence===
In the 16th century, the Portuguese arrived in Hadhramaut and established several settlements along the southern coast. However, their influence was short-lived as the Yemeni Imams managed to drive them out by the 17th century. Subsequently, Hadhramaut came under Ottoman influence, and the Ottomans maintained control over the region until the early 20th century.

===Modern===
==== Sultanates and the British rule ====
The Qu&#x27;aiti sultans ruled the vast majority of Hadramaut, under a loose British protectorate, the Aden Protectorate, from 1882 to 1967, when the Hadhramaut was annexed by South Yemen. The Qu&#x27;aiti dynasty was founded by Umar bin Awadh al-Qu&#x27;aiti, a Yafa&#x27;i tribesman whose wealth and influence as hereditary Jemadar of the Nizam of Hyderabad&#x27;s armed forces enabled him to establish the Qu&#x27;aiti dynasty in the latter half of the 19th century, winning British recognition of his paramount status in the region in 1882. The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937, appointing the British government as &quot;advisors&quot; in Hadhramaut. The British exiled him to Aden in 1945, but the Protectorate lasted until 1967.

==== Communist rule ====

In 1967, the former states of the British Aden Protectorate became an independent Communist state, the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen. South Yemen was united with North Yemen in 1990 as the Republic of Yemen.

==== Contemporary Yemen ====
The capital and largest city of Hadhramaut is the port Mukalla. Mukalla had a 1994 population of 122,400 and a 2003 population of 174,700, while the port city of Ash Shihr has grown from 48,600 to 69,400 in the same time. One of the more historically important cities in the region is Tarim. An important locus of Islamic learning, it is estimated to contain the highest concentration of descendants of Muhammad anywhere in the world.

==Geography==

===Political geography===
The borders of Hadhramaut have varied over time to include the territory between Aden and Dhofar, but it always included the Wadi Hadhramaut, the lands between the Wadi and the coast, and the desert region of the Empty Quarter north of the Wadi. This encompasses the current governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra in their entirety as well as parts of the Shabwah Governorate. The current governorate of Hadhramaut roughly incorporates the former territory of the two sultanates.

The Hadharem live in densely built towns centered on traditional watering stations along the wadis. Hadharem harvest crops of wheat and millet, tend date palm and coconut groves, and grow some coffee. On the plateau, Bedouins tend sheep and goats. Society is still highly tribal, with the old Seyyid aristocracy, descended from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, traditionally educated, strict in their Islamic observance, and highly respected in religious and secular affairs.

===Physical geography===

Hadhramaut is geographically divided into &quot;Inner Hadhramaut&quot; () which is made up of Wadi Hadhramaut, smaller tributary wadis south from the main wadi, and &quot;Coastal Hadhramaut&quot; () which consists of a narrow, arid coastal plain bounded by the steep escarpment of a broad plateau locally known as the &quot;Jowl&quot; (, averaging ). The undefined northern edge of Hadhramaut slopes down to the desert of the Empty Quarter, where the Hadhramaut Plateau or Highlands () meets the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, elevation abruptly decreases.

==== Inner Hadhramaut ====

===== Mountains =====
The Hadhramaut Mountains (), also known as the &quot;Mahrat Mountains&quot; (), are a mountain range in Yemen. They are contiguous with the Omani Dhofar Mountains to the northeast, and James Canton considered Aden in the southwest to be in the mountains&#x27; recesses.

===== Wadis =====

Wadi Hadhramaut () is the main wadi in the region which has 16 tributary wadis, which are:

==Economy==
Historically, Hadhramaut was known for being a major producer of frankincense, which in the early 20th century was mainly exported to Mumbai in India. The region has also produced senna and coconut. Currently, Hadhramaut produces approximately 260,000 barrels of oil per day; one of the most productive fields is &quot;Al Maseelah&quot; in the strip (14), which was discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is keen to develop its oil fields to increase oil production to increase national wealth in response to the requirements of economic and social development in the country. Oil contributes 30–40% of the nation&#x27;s GDP, over 70% of total state revenues, and more than 90% of the value of the country&#x27;s exports.

=== Oil and gas ===
A Soviet discovery in the southern governorate of Shabwah has proven only marginally successful even when taken over by a different group. A Western consortium began exporting oil from Masila in the Hadhramaut in 1993, and production there reached in 1999. There are new finds in the Jannah (formerly known as the Joint Oil Exploration Area) and east Shabwah blocks. Yemen&#x27;s oil exports in 1995 earned about US$1 billion. Yemen&#x27;s offshore oil and gas deposits are estimated to contain billions of barrels of oil and gas. Marib oil contains associated natural gas. In September 1995, the Yemeni Government signed an agreement that designated TotalEnergies of France to be the lead company for a project for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1997, Yemen Gas Company joined with various privately held companies to establish Yemen LNG (YLNG). In August 2005, the government gave final approval to three LNG supply agreements, enabling YLNG to award a $2 billion contract to an international consortium to build the country&#x27;s first liquefaction plant at Balhaf on the Arabian Sea coast. The project is a $3.7 billion investment over 25 years, producing approximately 6.7 million tons of LNG annually, with shipments likely to go to the United States and South Korea. Production of LNG began in October 2009. The Yemen government expects the LNG project to add $350 million to its budget and enable it to develop a petrochemicals industry.

Hadramout produces approximately 258.8 thousand barrels per day. One of the prominent oil fields is the Masila Basin Sector (14), discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is committed to developing its oil fields to increase oil production, aiming to enhance national wealth in response to the country&#x27;s economic and social development needs. Oil contributes between 30% and 40% of the gross domestic product (GDP) value and represents more than 70% of the total general budget revenues of the state. Moreover, it constitutes more than 90% of the country&#x27;s export value.
== Culture ==
=== Music ===
Hadhrami music is one of the five main Yemeni musical genres or &quot;colours&quot; (). It is native to the Hadhramaut region and regarded as one of the most prominent forms of Arabic music. Its unique maqamat are widely employed by composers and musicians throughout the Arabian Peninsula. It compasses vocal performances in the Hadhrami Arabic dialect and features melodic phrases and a characteristic humming-style known as the &quot;Dan&quot;.

Hadhramaut&#x27;s strategic location along the ancient incense road has shaped a unique musical traditions. Indian and African musical elements have intermingled with indigenous forms over time. Besides, It has been deeply influenced by Sufism.

The region is renowned for its vast array of over four hundred distinct rhythmic patterns that vary by locality. These rhythms are closely tied to daily activities and special occasions—from planting and fishing to wedding celebrations. A key musical form in the region is al-Dan, a fixed melodic structure in which the melody precedes the lyrics; in contrast, in other songs the lyrics typically come before the melody. Steps have been taken by the Yemeni government to include the Dan art on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, Cultural authorities in Yemen have already received initial approval from UNESCO to consider its inclusion.

Numerous art critics note that the Hadhrami Dan has played a pivotal role in shaping vocal traditions throughout the Arab world, particularly within the Gulf region. This distinctive musical form is regarded as a foundational element for many singing schools, with contemporary artists continuing to draw inspiration from its rich heritage and folkloric melodies.

The Hadhrami Dan has spread to the Arabian Gulf through the migration of Hadhrami musicians who settled in Gulf countries. Over time, local musicians integrated the Hadhrami Dan and other forms of the Dan and other Hadhrami musical forms into their own repertoires.
 Furthermore, Hadhrami music has significantly influenced the cultural landscapes of regions beyond the Arabian Peninsula, notably in parts of Africa and East Asia.
There are a number of Hadhrami influential musicians and poets who played important role in shaping the Hadhrami and the wider Arabian music . Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih (1932–2017), for example, modernised al-Dân songs by incorporating contemporary musical instruments, while poets such as Haddad al-Kaff (1910–1970) and Hussein al-Mihdhar (1932–2000) enriched the tradition with their lyrics. Additionally, Mohammed Juma Khan (1903–1963) is celebrated as a pioneer who blended his Punjabi musical influences with local traditions.

Moreover, several prominent non-Hadhrami Arab musicians have also embraced Hadhrami styles. These include Kuwaiti singer Abdallah Al Rowaished; Saudi singers Abdul Majeed Abdullah and Abdel Rab Idris, the latter of Hadhrami origin; as well as Emirati singers Ahlam and Hussain Al Jassmi.

The instruments used in Hadhrami music vary widely, encompassing percussion instruments, string instruments, wind instruments, and simple clapping techniques, often used individually or in combination. This includes notably the Qanbūs; which the Hadhrami migrants spread it across the Indian Ocean across the Muslim Southeast Asia areas (notably in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei).

== Demographics ==
The people of the region are known as the Hadharem belong generally to the semitic south Arabians who claim descent from Yarub bin Qahtan. There is, however, a large number of Sada (; : &quot;Sayyid&quot;), or descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and of townsmen of northern origin, besides a considerable class of African or mixed descent. The Sada, descendants of Husain ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic Prophet, Form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, tho chiefs of which are known as &quot;Munsibs&quot;, who are looked on as the religious leaders of the people and are even in some cases are regarded with great respect as saints. Among the leading families are that of &quot;Sheikh Abu Bakar bin Salem&quot; () of ʽAynat, &quot;al-Aidarus&quot; () of Shihr and Wadi Dawan, Bin Sumayt () of Shibam and the &quot;Sakkaf&quot; () of Seiyun. They do not bear arms, nor occupy themselves in trade nor manual labour nor even agriculture; though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes they are well educated and are strict tn their observance of religious duties, and owing to the respect due to their descent they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual affairs.

The Mashayikh () is another highly regarded group that is second in prestige to the Sada. Like the Sada, they don&#x27;t bear arms. Men from this group are given the honorific surname &quot;Sheikh&quot; () and women are given the surname &quot;Sheikha&quot; () which is different from the term &quot;Sheikh&quot; () that is used to refer to a tribal chief or a Muslim scholar. Prominent Mashayikh families include the ‘Amudi (), Ba Wazir (), and Ba ‘Abbad () families.

The Qaba&#x27;il () or tribesmen, as in the rest of Arabia, are the predominant class in the population. All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns and villages, others live a bedouin life keeping however within the territory which is recognised as belonging to the tribe. They are divided into sections or families, each headed by a chief whilst the head of the tribe is called the &quot;muqaddam&quot; or &quot;sultan&quot;. He is the leader in peace and in war, but the tribesmen are not his subjects; he can only rule with their support. Historically, the most powerful tribes in Hadhramaut was the &quot;Qu’aiti&quot;, a branch of the &quot;Yafa&#x27;a&quot; tribe. Originally invited by the Sada to protect the settled districts against the marauding tribes, they established themselves as rulers of the country, and possessed the coastal districts with the towns of Mukalla and Shihr as well as Shibam in the interior. The family had accumulated great wealth and was in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad in India as commander of the Arab levy composed of his tribesmen.

The townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Sada and the tribesmen; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, merchants, artificers, cultivators, and servants and are entirely dependent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live. The servile class contains a large African element, brought over formerly when the slave trade nourished on this coast; as all Islamic countries they are well treated, and often rise to positions of trust.

=== Hadhrami diaspora ===
Since the early 19th century, large-scale Hadhramaut migration has established sizable Hadhrami minorities all around the Indian Ocean, in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Africa, including Mombasa, Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Maharashtrian Konkan, Mangalore, Bhatkal, Gangolli, Malabar, Sylhet, Tanzania, the Malay Archipelago, Sri Lanka, southern Philippines and Singapore. In Hyderabad and Aurangabad, the community is known as Chaush and resides mostly in the neighborhood of Barkas. There are also settlements of Hadharem in Gujarat, such as in Ahmadabad and Surat. In South India, the Nawayath community also descends from Hadrami traders.

Earlier, several sultans in the Malay Archipelago such as the Malacca Sultanate, Pontianak Sultanate or Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura were descents of Hadharem . In the 19th century, Hadhrami businessmen owned many of the maritime armada of barks, brigs, schooners and other ships in the Malay archipelago. In modern times, several Indonesian ministers, including former Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and former Finance Minister Mar&#x27;ie Muhammad are of Hadhrami descent, as is the former Prime Minister of East Timor, Mari Alkatiri (2006).

The Hadharem have also settled in large numbers along the East African coast, and two former ministers in Kenya, Shariff Nasser and Najib Balala, are of Hadhrami descent. It has also been proved by genetic evidence that the Lemba people of Southern Africa bear some relation to the people of Hadramaut.

Within the Hadhramaut region there has been a historical Jewish population.

<doc id="325758" wikidata="Q438090" url="?curid=325758" title="Jacobus Clemens non Papa">
<text>Jacobus Clemens non Papa (also Jacques Clément or Jacob Clemens non Papa) ( – 1555 or 1556) was a Netherlandish composer of the Renaissance based for most of his life in Flanders. He was a prolific composer in many of the current styles, and was especially famous for his polyphonic settings of the psalms in Dutch known as the &quot;Souterliedekens&quot;.

==Life==
Nothing is known of Clemens&#x27;s early life, and even the details of the years of his artistic maturity are sketchy. He may have been born in Middelburg, Zeeland, though the evidence is contradictory; certainly he was from somewhere in modern Belgium or the Netherlands. The first unambiguous reference to him is from the late 1530s, when Pierre Attaingnant published a collection of his chansons in Paris. Between March 1544 and June 1545 he worked as &quot;succentor&quot; at the cathedral of Bruges, and shortly thereafter he began a business relationship with Tielman Susato, the publisher in Antwerp, which was to last for the rest of his life. From 1545 until 1549 he was probably choirmaster to Philippe de Croÿ, Duke of Aerschot, one of Charles V&#x27;s greatest generals, where he preceded Nicolas Gombert. In 1550 he was employed as &quot;sanger ende componist&quot; (&quot;singer and composer&quot;) by the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. There is also evidence that he lived and worked in Ypres and Leiden. It is speculated on slender evidence that he also worked in Dordrecht.

There are several theories regarding the origin of the epithet &quot;non Papa&quot;. One holds that it was jokingly added by his publisher, Susato, to distinguish him from Pope Clement VII—&quot;Jacob Clemens—but not the Pope.&quot; Another states that it is to distinguish him from Jacobus Papa, a poet also from Ypres. However, considering that Pope Clement VII died in 1534, before any of Clemens&#x27;s music was published, and that the confusion with the poet is unlikely in that the surnames were quite distinct, it is likely that the nickname was merely created in jest rather than for practical reasons. Nonetheless, the suffix has remained throughout the ages.

Details about his death are not known, but he probably died in 1555 or 1556. The 1558 text in Jacobus Vaet&#x27;s &quot;Continuo lacrimas&quot;, his &quot;déploration&quot; on Clemens&#x27;s death, suggests that he met a violent end, though if true, the circumstances are not given. According to a 1644 source, Clemens was buried at Diksmuide near Ypres in present-day Belgium.

==Works and influence==
Unlike many of his contemporaries, Clemens seems never to have traveled to Italy, with the result that Italian influence is absent in his music. He represents the northern European dialect of the Franco-Flemish style.

Clemens was one of the chief representatives of the generation after Josquin and before that of Palestrina and Orlandus Lassus. He was primarily a composer of sacred music; roughly 80 percent of his compositions were sacred music, either for liturgical or private use. Only three of his approximately 233 motets use secular texts; all three are hymns of praise of music. However, he composed over 100 secular works that encompass the whole gamut of poetic genres used by composers of his generation. Considering that his career as a composer lasted for barely two decades, Clemens was an extremely prolific composer. His output includes :

*15 masses, including 14 parody masses and a requiem mass (most of which were published from 1555 to 1570 by Petrus Phalesius the Elder in Leuven); two mass sections (a Kyrie and a Credo)
*15 Magnificats
*c. 233 motets
*Just over 100 secular pieces, including: 89 chansons (only 77 of which are considered authentic and are included in the complete edition of his works), 8 Dutch songs, 8 textless pieces, 2 intabulated chansons, and 1 instrumental canon (doubtful)
*159 &quot;Souterliedekens&quot;, i.e., Dutch settings of the psalms, using popular song melodies as &quot;cantus firmus&quot;.

Of all these works, the &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; were perhaps the most widely known and influential. The &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; were published in 1556–1557 by Susato in his &quot;Musyck Boexken&quot; (&quot;Music Books&quot;), IV-VII and comprised the only Protestant part-music in Dutch during the Renaissance. Based on a preceding volume of &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; printed by Symon Cock that contained monophonic settings of the psalms in Dutch, Clemens&#x27;s &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; became the first complete polyphonic setting of all 150 psalms in Dutch. Presumably, the original verse translation of the Psalter into the Dutch language was completed by Willem van Nievelt from Wittenberg. Clemens&#x27;s part-settings are generally simple, and designed to be sung by people at home. They use the well-known secular tunes that were printed in the Cock edition, including drinking songs, love songs, ballads, and other popular songs of the time, as a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;. Most of them were set for 3 parts, and there are 26 different combinations of these voices. Some of the &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; are based on dance-songs and are frankly homophonic and homorhythmic, while others use imitation. It is notable that these pieces of music survived the ban in 1569 when the government under the Duke of Alba censured all books that were deemed heretical.

After Clemens&#x27;s death, his works were distributed to Germany, France, Spain, and even among various circles in England. The influence of Clemens was especially prominent in Germany. Franco-Flemish composer Lassus in particular knew his music well and incorporated elements of his style.

<text>Gold Star Records is an American independent record label founded by Bill Quinn in Houston, Texas in 1941.

==History==

In 1939 Bill Quinn settled in Houston and established the Quinn Radio Service, a radio repair shop. After being intrigued by a home disc recorder he was asked to repair, he purchased one and began to experiment with it. In 1941 he opened a shop at 3104 Telephone Road in Houston, Texas, where he recorded personalized voice messages. Quinn renamed the business Quinn Recording Company and soon began recording radio jingles. Venturing into music production in 1944, he founded the short-lived Gulf Record Company label.

In 1946, Quinn founded Gold Star Records, initially recording local country (or &quot;hillbilly&quot;) artists before expanding to record local blues and Cajun artists. In 1947, Gold Star had its first hit record, &quot;Jole Blon&quot; by Harry Choates, a swing and dance tune that and became the first and only Cajun record to reach the &quot;Billboard Top Five&quot;. In 1948, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins&#x27; songs &quot;T-Model Blues&quot; and &quot;Tim Moore&#x27;s Farm&quot;, both became top 10 national hits, and Hopkins would record over 100 songs with Gold Star. Quinn also signed Lil&#x27; Son Jackson to the Gold Star Label, releasing &quot;Freedom Train Blues&quot; in 1948, which became a nationwide hit for Jackson. Quinn would also release several Cajun songs on his Opera label.

In 1950, Quinn moved the studio into the first floor of his family home at 5628 Brock Street, just a few blocks from the original studio. He changed the name of the studio to Gold Star Studios. Around this time, the U.S. Government fined Gold Star Records $26,000 for unpaid excise taxes related to the sale of phonograph records on the Gold Star label that Quinn mistakenly thought were being paid by the pressing plants, but weren&#x27;t. After costly legal negotiations, the sum total was reduced to $250, but Quinn ceased Gold Star Records operations. Quinn sold or leased his catalogue of Gold Star master recordings to other labels and utilized Gold Star Studios to record for other labels.

<doc id="325760" wikidata="Q665957" url="?curid=325760" title="Jacques Laffitte">
<text>Jacques Laffitte (24 October 1767 – 26 May 1844) was a leading French banker, governor of the Bank of France (1814–1820) and liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies during the Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy. He was an important figure in the development of new banking techniques during the early stages of industrialization in France. In politics, he played a decisive role during the Revolution of 1830 that brought Louis-Philippe, the duc d&#x27;Orléans, to the throne, replacing the unpopular Bourbon king Charles X. 

Laffitte was named president of the new Citizen King&#x27;s Council of Ministers and Minister of Finances (2 November 1830 – 13 March 1831). After a brief ministry of 131 days, his &quot;Party of Movement&quot; gave way before the &quot;Party of Order&quot; led by the banker Casimir-Pierre Périer. Laffitte left office discredited politically and financially ruined. He rebounded financially in 1836 with his creation of the &quot;Caisse Générale du Commerce et de l&#x27;Industrie&quot;, a forerunner of French investment banks of the second half of the 19th century such as the &quot;Crédit Mobilier&quot; (1852). The &quot; Caisse Générale&quot; did not survive the financial crisis caused by the Revolution of 1848.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Laffitte was born in 1767 at Bayonne in the French Basque Country, one of four sons and six daughters of Pierre Laffitte, a master carpenter. He apprenticed with his father for a time, but also found clerking positions with a local notary and merchant. In 1788, at 21 years of age and on the eve of the Revolution in France, he arrived in Paris at the offices of the prominent Swiss banker Jean-Frédéric Perregaux (1744–1808), rue du Sentier, where he was hired as a bookkeeper. It was a starting position that offered Laffitte valuable learning experiences and great potential for advancement. Perregaux was a banker with a wealthy clientele, important foreign connections and friends in high places. 

He was a shrewd, cosmopolitan businessman who prospered from the Revolution. He helped to bankroll Napoleon&#x27;s rise to power and became a founder of the Bank of France in 1800 and president of its directing Council of Regents. Laffitte became Perregaux&#x27;s right-hand man in the private bank and was promoted to a partnership in 1806. In 1807, because of Perregaux&#x27;s declining health, he was named managing director and effective head of the bank. The bank&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Perregaux, Laffitte and Company&quot;. Perregaux&#x27;s son, Alphonse (1785–1841), and his sister, were sleeping partners (&quot;commanditaires&quot;). Virginie Monnier observes: &quot;For the first time in the history of banks in France, a clerk took over his patron&#x27;s position directly.&quot; When Perregaux died in 1808, Laffitte also took over his place as one of the fifteen regents of the Bank of France. He became president of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris (1810–1811) and was appointed as a judge of the Tribunal de commerce de la Seine (1813). 

After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, he was named provisional governor of the Bank of France by the incoming Bourbon king Louis XVIII. Napoleon, when on his way into final exile after Waterloo (15 June 1815), reportedly deposited 6 million francs in Laffitte&#x27;s bank. When Napoleon&#x27;s estate was being contested later in 1826, Laffitte calculated his bank&#x27;s obligation at 3,856,121 francs, interest included.

===Business career during the Restoration===
During the Bourbon Restoration, &quot;Jacques Laffitte and Company&quot; was one of the wealthiest private banks in Paris and a leading firm among the select group of twenty or so banking houses known collectively as the &quot;haute banque parisienne&quot;. Besides Laffitte, the group included the banks of Casimir and Scipion Perier fr, Benjamin Delessert, Jean Hottinguer, Adolphe Mallet, François Cottier fr, Antoine Odier, Jacques Lefebvre fr and Michel Pillet-Will fr. 

The capital resources of such early 19th century banks were limited, but they associated for underwriting major government loans and for financing promising private business ventures. Laffitte associated with Delessert, Hottinguer, James de Rothschild and others to compete in 1817–18 with the powerful foreign banks of Baring Brothers (London) and Hope &amp; Company (Amsterdam) for underwriting shares in France&#x27;s loans of liberation. Earlier, in 1816, he took the lead with Delessert in founding the &quot;Compagnie Royale d&#x27;Assurances Maritimes&quot;,a pioneer joint-stock insurance company with a capitalization of 10 million francs. Laffitte was president and Casimir and Scipion Perier were among the administrators of this capital mobilizing venture. In 1818, along with fellow banker and industrialist Benjamin Delessert, Laffitte was a key figure in the establishment of the first French savings bank, the &quot;Caisse d&#x27;Épargne et de Prévoyance de Paris&quot;. Practically all of the members of the board of regents of the Bank of France, where Laffitte was then governor, were listed as administrators of the new bank. Laffitte was reaching the peak of his good fortune by 1818. He was sufficiently wealthy by then to be able to purchase the 17th century Château de Maisons (Department of Yvelines), near Paris, designed by the famous architect François Mansart. Before the Revolution, the beautiful château was the property of Louis XVI&#x27;s brother, the comte d&#x27;Artois, who would come to the throne in 1824 as Charles X. Possessing Maisons, and being able to entertain notables of French society there in the former royal château, was a personal triumph for Laffitte, the son of a Bayonne carpenter. It was &quot;le rêve d&#x27;un parvenu&quot; (the dream of a newly rich) at a time when family history, titles and property holdings mattered so much.

In 1821–1822, Laffitte was the moving spirit behind the formation of the &quot;Compagnie des Quatre Canaux&quot;, a joint-stock company that mobilized the capital assets of &quot;haute banque&quot; members to help finance a major canal construction program initiated by the government. Laffitte&#x27;s consortium obtained one-half of the total value of the loans made to the government. The top four lenders for the Four Canals Company were Jacques Laffitte &amp; Co. (11,736,000 francs), H. Hentsch, Blanc &amp; Co. (11,736,000), Pillet-Will &amp; Co. (10,976,000) and André &amp; Cottier (7,870,000). Laffitte&#x27;s bid for an even larger share in the loans had been rejected by the ultra-royalist ministry of Count Jean-Antoine Villèle. In 1825, Laffitte&#x27;s ambitious financial planning was frustrated a second time when Villèle refused to authorize his proposed &quot;Société Commanditaire de l&#x27;Industrie&quot;, a private investment bank designed to provide bank credit for large-scale industrial development in France. The &quot;Commanditaire&quot;, with Laffitte as its president, was to be capitalized at 100 million francs. It had the backing of French industrialists, many &quot;haute banque&quot; members in Paris and leading banking houses in London, Geneva and Frankfurt. Casimir Perier and the famous woolens industrialist William Ternaux were to have been its two vice-presidents. &quot;L&#x27;esprit d&#x27;association&quot; (the spirit of association), which was a broad slogan of the time among liberals for promoting economic progress, would have been exemplified by the company. But the &quot;Commanditaire&quot; was ill-timed politically: Laffitte was then a leader of the liberal opposition to the government of Charles X. Also, the plan was seen as too ambitious, even audacious, by the conservative regents and government administrators of the influential Bank of France. Laffitte would need to wait and try again after the July Revolution of 1830.

===Political career===

Laffitte viewed the return of the Bourbons favorably at first. He provided financial assistance for the incoming Louis XVIII (1814–1824) and kept his position as governor of the Bank of France during 1814–1820. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1815 and continued as a deputy throughout the Restoration except for the years 1824–27. Like his fellow elected deputy and banker Casimir Pierre Périer, he took a liberal stance &quot;on the left&quot; and spoke out in the Chamber in support of constitutional monarchy, liberty of the press, freedom of enterprise, competence in state administration and transparency in government financial affairs. As the Bourbon regime became more and more conservative and royalist after 1820, Laffitte became increasingly dissatisfied and outspoken in opposition. With Casimir Perier, he led a spirited opposition in the Chamber in the 1820s against Comte Villèle&#x27;s handling of the finances of the government&#x27;s canal construction program. He lost favor in 1825 by voting for Villèle&#x27;s plan for indemnifying notables for lands confiscated during the Revolution, but regained popular support in 1828 when his daughter, Albine Laffitte, was married to Napoleon-Joseph Ney, the son of the honored Maréchal Michel Ney, duc d&#x27;Elchingen, the prince de Moskowa. Things began to go wrong rapidly after Charles X became king in 1824. Fearful of growing liberal and even republican opposition to his government, the king finally acted disastrously in 1829 by installing the ultra-royalist ministry of Prince Jules de Polignac. When the ultra-royalists were defeated in the elections of 1830 the King issued his infamous ordinances of 25 July 1830, suspending freedom of the press, dissolving the Chamber of Deputies, and changing election laws in favor of the landed nobility. The upshot was the July Revolution of 1830.

Laffitte was one of the earliest and most determined advocates for ousting Charles X and his ministers and establishing a new government under Louis Philippe I, the duc d&#x27;Orléans, whose father, Philippe Égalité, had supported the Revolution of 1789. Laffitte&#x27;s home in Paris became a headquarters for the &quot;Party of Movement&quot; to make Louis-Philippe the &quot;Citizen King&quot; of a reformed constitutional monarchy. Against the background of popular insurrection in Paris and growing unrest in the provinces, the plan succeeded. Charles X fled to England, his ministers were arrested, Louis-Philippe I assumed the throne and Laffitte became president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Finances (2 November 1830 – 13 March 1831). As it proved, Laffitte was much better as a banker and financier than as a king maker or political leader. His government, torn between the necessity for preserving order in France and the need to conciliate the Parisian populace, succeeded in doing neither. To moderate liberals in the Chamber of Deputies like Casimir Perier, and even for the king himself, his dealings with popular revolutionary figures such as General Lafayette were moving France dangerously toward the establishment of a republic. Perier refused to have anything to do with Laffitte&#x27;s ministry. After 131 days of turmoil and indecision, Laffitte was forced to resign and Perier&#x27;s &quot;Party of Order&quot; formed a new ministry. Laffitte would keep his seat in the Chamber after 1831, but he would never lead or be part of another ministry.

Laffitte&#x27;s foray into the complicated politics of 1830 in France cost him dearly financially. The revolution had worsened an already troubled French economy. Laffitte &amp; Co. suffered losses of 13 million francs and the bank had to be liquidated (January 1831). To help cover his bank&#x27;s losses, Laffitte talked the governor of the Bank of France into arranging an unprecedented bank loan of 7 million francs. He put his Paris home on the rue d&#x27;Artois (now the rue Laffitte) and his art collection up for sale. Most importantly, for 6 million francs. he sold off family woodlands at Breteuil to the king, Louis-Philippe, which helped greatly but hurt Laffitte politically and financially when the king made the sale public. Laffitte at least managed to protect the Château de Maisons from sale, but he divided up its extensive parklands into lots for building country villas to sell to rich Parisians. This actually became a remarkably creative early experiment in suburban real estate development, as described in a brochure prepared by M. de Rouvières entitled &quot;Histoire et description pittoresque de Maisons-Laffitte &quot; (1838). Laffitte and his brother, Jean-Baptiste Laffitte, established a stage coach line for the 15-kilometer trip from Paris to Maisons. His nephew, Charles Laffitte (1803–1875), and his son-in-law, the Prince de Moskowa, added a grassland horse racing track – the first in France.

===Recovery===
By 1836–37 Laffitte had his affairs sufficiently in order to revive his 1825 plan for the &quot;Commanditaire&quot;. He created (15 July 1837) the &quot;Caisse Générale du Commerce et de l&#x27;Industrie&quot; to help provide long-term credit for industrial enterprise. The &quot;commandite&quot; rather than the joint-stock form of association was employed. The venture was capitalized at 55 million francs. The Bank of France imposed some annoying restrictions (the term &quot;Banque&quot; could not be employed), but otherwise the venture&#x27;s approval went forward successfully. Laffitte&#x27;s principal associates were his brother, Martin Laffitte (1783–1840), and the sugar industrialist François Lebaudy (1799–1863). Was this company the prototype for the great joint-stock investment banks of the second half of the 19th century in France? Historians continue to research and ponder this question. Laffitte himself appears to have understood that the &quot;Caisse Générale&quot; did not fulfill his dream of a real &quot;banque d&#x27;affaires.&quot; He wrote in his Mémoires: &quot;If I was never able to create a great credit establishment like the one I would have wished, I at least built a great banking house that will be useful to Commerce and my family for a long time. That&#x27;s a manly enough achievement for a 70-year old. Although others after me succeed in creating great credit establishments, for me there will remain the pride in having tried.&quot;

===Final years and legacy===
Undoubtedly, had he lived longer, Laffitte would have led the &quot;Caisse Générale&quot; enthusiastically into the risky business of financing railroad construction in France. Bonin has noted that by 1843 the company had already edged into the field with a 10 million franc loan for railroad construction by the &quot;Compagnie du Nord&quot;. Laffitte&#x27;s nephew, Charles Laffitte, was involved with the investment. But Jacques Laffitte was seriously ill with pulmonary disease at the time. He died in Paris on 26 May 1844, at 77 years of age. The &quot;Caisse Générale&quot; was continued for a few years under the direction of the banker Alexandre Goüin (1792–1872), but failed to survive the Revolution of 1848 in France. Goüin wrote in his unpublished autobiography that, in his experience, the design failure of the company was that it could not cope adequately with both its long-term investments and its short-term commercial loans during times of financial crisis. The demise of the company during the economic crisis of 1847–48 in France was a case in point.

<doc id="325761" wikidata="Q1567567" url="?curid=325761" title="Treaty of Tlatelolco">
<text>The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (commonly known as The Tlatelolco Treaty) is an international treaty that establishes the denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean. It was proposed by Adolfo López Mateos, the President of Mexico, and promoted by the Mexican diplomats Alfonso García Robles, Ismael Moreno Pino and Jorge Castañeda as a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962). For his efforts in favor of the reduction of nuclear weapons, García Robles was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.

The preparation of the text was entrusted to the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America (COPREDAL), which established its headquarters in Mexico City and held four plenary sessions. The Treaty was signed by the signatory countries on February 12, 1967 and entered into force on April 25, 1969.

The organization in charge of monitoring compliance with said treaty is OPANAL (Organization for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean). Signed in 1967, it was the first treaty of its kind covering a populated area of the world, establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone stretching from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.

==Provisions==
Under the treaty, the states parties agree to prohibit and prevent the &quot;testing, use, manufacture, production or acquisition by any means whatsoever of any nuclear weapons&quot; and the &quot;receipt, storage, installation, deployment and any form of possession of any nuclear weapons.&quot;

The treaty requires its parties to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has a mechanism for states to request special inspections in case of suspected violations. It formally entered into force when all states in zone brought those agreements into force. It also has a provision allowing states to waive that entry into force requirement and bring the treaty into force on a national basis.

===Protocols===
There are two additional protocols to the treaty:
* Protocol I binds those overseas countries with territories in the region (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands) to the terms of the treaty. 
* Protocol II requires the world&#x27;s declared nuclear weapons states to refrain from undermining in any way the nuclear-free status of the region; it has been signed and ratified by the US, the UK, France, China, and Russia.

==History==
Meeting in the Tlatelolco district of Mexico City on 14 February 1967, the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean drafted this treaty to keep their region of the world free of nuclear weapons.
Whereas Antarctica had earlier been declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone under the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, this was the first time such a ban was put in place over a large, populated area.

COPREDAL was the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America created after the Cuban Missile Crisis. It consisted of four sets of sessions, all of them which held in Mexico City. The purpose of the sessions was to prepare a possible draft of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.

The United Nations Assembly authorized COPREDAL on 27 November 1963. The Preliminary Meeting on the Denuclearization of Latin America (REUPRAL) created the &quot;Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America&quot;, COPREDAL.

There were four sets of COPREDAL&#x27;s sessions. The first set of sessions took place from 15 to 22 March 1965, the second set of sessions from 23 August to 2 September 1965 and the third set of sessions from 19 April to 4 May 1965. The fourth set of sessions, also known as the Final Act, was divided into two parts. Part I started on 30 August 19 and Part II followed on 31 January to 14 February 1967.

In the first two sets of sessions, participants simply reported the activities that needed to be done in the following sets of sessions. The agreements made in the third set of sessions consisted of presenting a report of the previous changes to de Co-ordinating Committee and preparing the draft for the following Treaty of the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. At the end of the fourth session, the objective was to entry the treaty into force.

Preparatory Commission created two working groups. Working group 1 was in charge of investigating control systems and predominant technical problems. Working group 2 dealt with legal and political questions. A Drafting Group was also created in order to prepare the final texts.

== List of parties ==

The following table lists the parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco. All are also parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The table also indicates which ones had become parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) by 26 November 2023.

==Observers==
Some other countries participated as observers, in every set of sessions such as Austria, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, India, Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States of America. International organizations were present as well, for example the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The Latin American countries other than Cuba all signed the treaty in 1967, along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, and all of these ratified the treaty by 1972. The treaty came into force on 22 April 1968, after El Salvador had joined Mexico in ratifying it and waived the conditions for its entry into force in accordance with its Article 28.

Argentina ratified in 1994, more than 26 years after signature, and was thus unprotected by the zone during the Falklands War.

Other English-speaking Caribbean nations signed either soon after independence from the U.K. (1968, 1975, 1983) or years later (1989, 1992, 1994, 1995), all ratifying within 4 years after signing. However, as British territories they had been covered since 1969 when the U.K. ratified Protocol I.

The Netherlands ratified Protocol I in 1971; Suriname signed the Treaty in 1976 soon after independence from the Netherlands but did not ratify until 1997, 21 years after signing.
The U.S. signed Protocol I applying to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1977 and ratified in 1981.
France signed Protocol I applying to its Caribbean islands and French Guiana in 1979 but only ratified in 1992.
All five NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states ratified Protocol II by 1979.

Cuba was the last country to sign and to ratify, in 1995 and on 23 October 2002, completing signature and ratification by all 33 nations of Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba ratified with a reservation that achieving a solution to the United States hostility to Cuba and the use of the Guantánamo Bay military base for U.S. nuclear weapons was a precondition to Cuba&#x27;s continued adherence.

The Mexican diplomat Alfonso García Robles received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 for his efforts in promoting the treaty.

== Diplomatic consequences ==
The basic agreement for Latin America is the possession of nuclear weapons directly or indirectly is prohibited. With the intention of The Kingdom of the Netherlands desire to participate, COPREDAL&#x27;s members decided not to include countries outside the region, including those which had territories in the region.

The regional territories belonging to countries outside the region would decide either to permit or deny the passage of nuclear weapons; countries such as United States and France recognized those transit agreements. The Soviet Union refused to recognize such transit agreements.

<doc id="325764" wikidata="Q336750" url="?curid=325764" title="Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead">
<text>Hercules George Robert Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead, (19 December 1824 – 28 October 1897), was a British colonial administrator who became the 5th Governor of Hong Kong, then 13th Governor of Ceylon, and subsequently, the 14th Governor of New South Wales, the first Governor of Fiji, and the 8th Governor of New Zealand. Later in his career he held various positions in Southern Africa, including two terms as Governor of the Cape Colony. From June 1859 until August 1896, he was known as Sir Hercules Robinson.

==Early life and Government career==
He was of Irish descent on both sides; his father was Admiral Hercules Robinson, his mother was Frances Elizabeth Wood, from Rosmead, County Westmeath, from which he afterwards took his title. From the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the 87th Foot as a second lieutenant on 27 January 1843, he was promoted lieutenant by purchase on 6 September 1844, and reached the rank of captain. However, in 1846, through the influence of Lord Naas, Robinson obtained a post in the Board of Public Works in Ireland and subsequently became chief commissioner of fairs and markets.

His energy in these positions, notably during the famine of 1848, and the clearness and vigour of his reports, secured for him at the age of 29 the office of president of the council of the island of Montserrat on 14 February 1854.

Robinson also pushed for the introduction of a cadet scheme in the colonial administration during the similar serendipitous civil service reforms advocated by William Gladstone, the then chancellor of the exchequer. He proposed a civil service examination held in the UK that selected the successful candidates (the cadet) to learn Chinese and subsequently work in Hong Kong. The approval of the Colonial Office to this proposal resulted in the gradual expansion of the cadet and although the cadet did not fulfil the initial expectation of working as an interpreter, they provided excellent civil service in the administration and established rules in the process, emancipating the administration from &quot;ad hoc&quot; and disorganised practices.

==Service in St Kitts and Hong Kong==
Subsequently, Robinson was appointed lieutenant-governor of Saint Kitts on 6 November 1855, serving until 1859. On 17 June 1859, aged 35 Robinson was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, the youngest in Hong Kong colonial history, as which he served until March 1865. On 28 June 1859, he was knighted in recognition of his services for introducing coolie labour into the territory.

During his tenure, Robinson secured the control of the Kowloon Peninsula from the Imperial Chinese Government, thus expanding the size of the territory. Up to this point, the Colony of Hong Kong only consisted of Hong Kong Island. Also, Robinson ordered the construction of the Pokfulam Reservoir, which would provide a steady supply of water for Hong Kong people for years to come. Robinson was also credited with establishing Towngas, the territory&#x27;s premier gas provider (a position it still holds today), for lighting the streets.

During Robertson&#x27;s administration, HSBC, along with Standard Chartered, were established in Hong Kong. Both were given the responsibility to print banknotes on the behalf of the Government, a responsibility both banks still hold today.

==Service in Ceylon, New South Wales and New Zealand==
On 6 March 1865, Robinson was appointed Governor of Ceylon. On 30 June 1869, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). From 4 March 1872 to 24 February 1879, he served as the Governor of New South Wales. Before his arrival in the colony, the &quot;Australian Town and Country Journal&quot; apprised its readers of Robinson&#x27;s &quot;high reputation for administrative ability&quot; and provided biographical details. He attended the official opening of Sydney&#x27;s grand new General Post Office on 1 September 1874.

During this governorship, Robinson was involved in the successful efforts to annexe the Fiji Islands to the British Empire, and his services were rewarded on 28 January 1875 by promotion to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). He temporarily served as Governor of Fiji from 10 October 1874 to June 1875, while concurrently Governor of New South Wales. On 24 February 1879, Robinson was transferred to New Zealand, and on 21 August 1880, in the wake of the Anglo-Zulu War, he succeeded Sir Henry Bartle Frere as High Commissioner for Southern Africa (George Cumine Strahan was also appointed as interim administrator to act until Robinson could arrive from New Zealand).

==Service in South Africa==
Robinson arrived in South Africa shortly before the disaster of Majuba, and was one of the commissioners for negotiating a peace and determining the future status of Transvaal. The job was known to be personally distasteful to him, for it left him with the task of conciliating, on the one hand, a Dutch party elated with victory, and on the other hand a British party almost ready to despair of the British connection.

In 1883, Robinson was called home to advise the government on the terms of the new convention concluded with the Transvaal Boers, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council. On 27 February 1884 Robinson signed the London Convention for the British government, with Paul Kruger, the new state president of the South African Republic, S.J. du Toit and N.J. Smit signing for the South African Republic.

On his return to South Africa, Robinson he found that a critical situation had arisen in Bechuanaland (today&#x27;s Botswana), where Boer commandos had seized large tracts of territory and proclaimed the republics of Stellaland and Goshen. The commandos refused to retire within the limits of the Transvaal as defined by the new convention, and Robinson, aware of the necessity of preserving this country – the main road to the north – for the British Empire, determined on vigorous action.

John Mackenzie and later Cecil Rhodes were sent to secure the peaceful submission of the Boers, but without immediate result, partly owing to the attitude of the Cape ministry. Robinson&#x27;s declaration that the advice of his ministers to patch up a settlement with the filibustering Boers was equivalent to a condonation of crime, led to the expedition of Major General Sir Charles Warren and the annexation of Bechuanaland early in 1885. He repeatedly argued for the Bechuanaland Protectorate to be extended north, beyond 22°. The British government resisted the idea until 1890, when land north of 22° was incorporated.

The difficulties of Robinson&#x27;s position were illustrated by the dispute which arose between him and Warren, who declared that the high commissioner&#x27;s duties to the home government were at times in conflict with the action which, as governor of Cape Colony, he was bound to take on the advice of his ministers in the interests of the colony. Sir Hercules Robinson succeeded in winning the confidence of President Kruger by his fair-mindedness, while he seconded Rhodes&#x27; efforts to unite the British and Dutch parties in Cape Colony. His mind, however, was that of the administrator as distinguished from the statesman, and he was content to settle difficulties as they arose.

In 1886, Robinson investigated the charges brought against Sir John Pope Hennessy, Governor of Mauritius, and decreed his suspension pending the decision of the home authorities, who eventually reinstated Hennessy. In 1887 Robinson was induced by Rhodes to give his consent to the conclusion of a treaty with Lobengula which secured British rights in Matabele and Mashona lands.

In May 1889, Robinson retired. In his farewell speech, he declared that there was no permanent place in South Africa for direct Imperial rule. This was interpreted to mean that South Africa must ultimately become independent – an idea repugnant to him. He explained in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1895 that he had referred to the &quot;direct rule of Downing Street over the crown colonies, as contrasted with responsible colonial government.&quot;

Robinson was created a baronet on 6 February 1891. Early in 1895, when he had entered his 71st year in below average health, he yielded to the entreaties of Lord Rosebery&#x27;s cabinet, and went out again to South Africa, in succession to Sir Henry Loch.

==Second term as Governor of Cape Colony==
His second term of office was not fortunate. The Jameson Raid produced a permanent estrangement between him and Cecil Rhodes, and he was out of sympathy with the new colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, who had criticised his appointment, and now desired Robinson to take this opportunity of settling the whole question of the position of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal.

Robinson answered that the moment was inopportune and that he must be left to choose his own time. Alarmed at the imminent danger of war, he confined his efforts to inducing the Johannesburgers to lay down their arms on condition that the raiders&#x27; lives were spared, not knowing that these terms had already been granted to Jameson. He came home to confer with the government, and on 10 August 1896 was raised to the peerage as Baron Rosmead, of Rosmead in the County of Westmeath and of Tafelberg in South Africa. The new Lord Rosmead returned to South Africa later in the year, but was compelled by ill-health, in April 1897, to quit his post.

==Personal life==
Robinson married The Honourable Nea Arthur Ada Rose D&#x27;Amour Annesley, fifth daughter of The 10th Viscount Valentia, in 1846. Lady Robinson was described as &quot;a majestic-looking woman&quot;, &quot;fond of gaiety and society&quot;.

Their daughter, Nora, (born in St Kitts in 1858) married Alexander Finlay in St James&#x27; Church, Sydney on 7 August 1878. This vice-regal wedding attracted great interest from the populace and press. A crowd of up to 10,000 onlookers was reported and the guest list included many of the most important people in the colony.
Robinson died in London on 28 October 1897, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. His son, Hercules Arthur Temple Robinson, succeeded to the title of Baron Rosmead.

==Legacy==
In Hong Kong, Robinson Road, Rosmead Road (), and Robinson Island () were all named after him. There was a Robinson Road in the Kowloon Peninsula that was named after him. However, the name was changed to Nathan Road on 19 March 1909. In Sri Lanka, Rosmead Place in Colombo 7 was named after him.

In South Africa, there are two Rosmead Avenues in Cape Town, one in Claremont–Kenilworth and the other in Oranjezicht, a suburb of Cape Town proper. South Africa also includes two small towns named Rosmead, one near Kimberley in the Northern Cape and one near Middelburg in the Eastern Cape.

In Australia, a building in Crown Street, Sydney, includes a couple of terraced houses named for Hercules Robinson. A monumental bust of Sir Hercules sits atop the facade. On Sydney&#x27;s General Post Office at 1 Martin Place, on the Pitt Street side arches of the building, there are carvings of four of New South Wales governors including Sir Hercules.

<text>Humming Bird Records (often referred to as Hummingbird Records) was a mid-20th century record label based in Waco, Texas.

The label focused on local and regional artists of various genres including Cajun music (e.g. Harry Choates) and Texas Czech polka/waltz music (e.g. Frank Kubin, Rhine Winkler, etc.).

Humming Bird initially issued releases on 78rpm before transitioning to 45rpm.

<text>Nova (stylized as NOVΛ) is an American popular science television program produced by WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts, since 1974. It is broadcast on PBS in the United States, and in more than 100 other countries. The program has won many major television awards.

&quot;Nova&quot; often includes interviews with scientists doing research in the subject areas covered and occasionally includes footage of a particular discovery. Some episodes have focused on the history of science. Examples of topics covered include the following: 
Colditz Castle,
the Drake equation,
elementary particles,
the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens,
Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem,
the AIDS epidemic, 
global warming,
moissanite,
Project Jennifer,
storm chasing,
Unterseeboot 869,
Vinland,
Tarim mummies, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The &quot;Nova&quot; programs have been praised for their pacing, writing, and editing. Websites that accompany the segments have also won awards.

==Episodes==
==History==
&quot;Nova&quot; was first aired on March 3, 1974. The show was created by Michael Ambrosino, inspired by the BBC 2 television series &quot;Horizon&quot;, which Ambrosino had seen while working in the UK. In the early years, many &quot;Nova&quot; episodes were either co-productions with the BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; team, or other documentaries originating outside of the United States, with the narration re-voiced in American English. Of the first 50 programs, only 19 were original WGBH productions, and the first &quot;Nova&quot; episode, &quot;The Making of a Natural History Film&quot;, was originally an episode of &quot;Horizon&quot; that premiered in 1972. The practice continues to this day. All the producers and associate producers for the original &quot;Nova&quot; teams came from either England (with experience on the &quot;Horizon&quot; series), Los Angeles or New York. Ambrosino was succeeded as executive producer by John Angier, John Mansfield, and Paula S. Apsell, acting as senior executive producer.

== Reception ==
Rob Owen of &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote, &quot;Fascinating and gripping.&quot; Alex Strachan of &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; wrote,&quot;TV for people who don&#x27;t normally watch TV.&quot; Lynn Elber of the Associated Press wrote of the episode &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot;, &quot;Mind-blowing TV.&quot; &quot;The Futon Critic&quot; wrote of the episode &quot;Looking for Life on Mars&quot;, &quot;Astounding [and] exhilarating.&quot;

==Awards==

&quot;Nova&quot; has been recognized with multiple Peabody Awards and Emmy Awards. The program won a Peabody in 1974, citing it as &quot;an imaginative series of science adventures,&quot; with a &quot;versatility rarely found in television.&quot; Subsequent Peabodys went to specific episodes:
* &quot;The Miracle of Life&quot; (1983) was cited as a &quot;fascinating and informative documentary of the human reproductive process,&quot; which used &quot;revolutionary microphotographic techniques.&quot; This episode also won an Emmy.
* &quot;Spy Machines&quot; (1987) was cited for &quot;neatly recount[ing] the key events of the Cold War and look[ing] into the future of American/Soviet SDI competition.&quot;
* &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; (2003) was lauded for exploring &quot;science&#x27;s most elaborate and ambitious theory, the string theory&quot; while making &quot;the abstract concrete, the complicated clear, and the improbable understandable&quot; by &quot;blending factual story telling with animation, special effects, and trick photography.&quot; The episode also won an Emmy for editing.

The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (responsible for documentary Emmys) recognized the program with awards in 1978, 1981, 1983, and 1989. Julia Cort won an Emmy in 2001 for writing &quot;Life&#x27;s Greatest Miracle.&quot; Emmys were also awarded for the following episodes:
* 1982 &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking at You, Kid&quot;
* 1983 &quot;The Miracle of Life&quot; (also won a Peabody)
* 1985 &quot;AIDS: Chapter One&quot;, &quot;Acid Rain: New Bad News&quot;
* 1992 &quot;Suicide Mission to Chernobyl&quot;, &quot;The Russian Right Stuff&quot;
* 1994 &quot;Secret of the Wild Child&quot;
* 1995 &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;, &quot;Secret of the Wild Child&quot;
* 1999 &quot;Decoding Nazi Secrets&quot;
* 2001 &quot;Bioterror&quot;
* 2002 &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Battle for the Heavens&quot;, &quot;Mountain of Ice&quot;, &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s Voyage of Endurance&quot;, &quot;Why the Towers Fell&quot;
* 2003 &quot;Battle of the X-planes&quot;, &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; (also won a Peabody)

<text>The Battle of Sedan was fought during the Franco-Prussian War from 1 to 2 September 1870. Resulting in the capture of Emperor Napoleon III and over a hundred thousand troops, it effectively decided the war in favour of Prussia and its allies, though fighting continued under a new French government.

The 130,000-strong French Army of Châlons, commanded by Marshal Patrice de MacMahon and accompanied by Napoleon III, was attempting to lift the siege of Metz, only to be caught by the Prussian Fourth Army and defeated at the Battle of Beaumont on 30 August. Commanded by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Helmuth von Moltke and accompanied by Prussian King Wilhelm I and Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the Fourth Army and the Prussian Third Army encircled MacMahon&#x27;s army at Sedan in a battle of annihilation. Marshal MacMahon was wounded during the attacks and command passed to General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, until assumed by General Emmanuel Félix de Wimpffen.

Bombarded from all sides by German artillery and with all breakout attempts defeated, the French Army of Châlons capitulated on 2 September, with 104,000 men passing into German captivity along with 558 guns. Napoleon III was taken prisoner, while the French government in Paris continued the war and proclaimed a Government of National Defense on 4 September. The German armies besieged Paris on 19 September.

==Background==

After its pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August, Marshal François Achille Bazaine&#x27;s 154,481-man Army of the Rhine retreated to Metz where it was surrounded by 168,435 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies in the siege of Metz beginning on 19 August. Emperor Napoleon III, along with Marshal Patrice de MacMahon, formed the new French Army of Châlons on 17 August to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. With Napoleon III personally leading the army, and with Marshal MacMahon in attendance, they led the Army of Châlons after 23 August in a left-flanking march northeast towards the Belgian border in an attempt to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine.

The Prussians had repeatedly outmaneuvered the French in the string of victories through August, and the march depleted the French forces and left both flanks exposed. The Prussians, under the command of von Moltke, took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in a pincer movement. Leaving the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, Moltke took the Prussian Third and Fourth Armies northward where they caught up with the French at the Battle of Beaumont on 30 August.

After a major defeat in which he lost 7,500 men and 40 cannons, MacMahon aborted the planned link-up with Bazaine and ordered the Army of Châlons to withdraw north-west towards the obsolete 17th-century fortress of Sedan. His intention was to rest the army, which had been involved in a long series of marches, resupply it with ammunition and, in his words, maneuver in front of the enemy. MacMahon underestimated the German strength and believed the hills surrounding Sedan would offer a major defensive advantage. The French rear was protected by the fortress of Sedan, and offered a defensive position at the Calvaire d&#x27;Illy, which had both hills and woods to provide cover for any defense. MacMahon denied a request from General Félix Douay, commander of 7th Corps, to dig trenches, claiming the army would not remain at Sedan for long.

Upon arrival in the vicinity of Sedan on 31 August, MacMahon deployed Douay&#x27;s 7th Corps to the north-west on the crest between the Calvaire and Floing. Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot&#x27;s 1st Corps faced east, while Lebrun&#x27;s 12th Corps garrisoned Bazeilles. The recently arrived General Emmanuel Félix de Wimpffen assumed command of 5th Corps from Pierre Louis Charles de Failly, the unit having been routed at Beaumont. 5th Corps was placed in reserve in the centre.

Moltke divided his forces into three groups: one to detain the French where they were, another to race forward and catch them if they retreated, and a third (the smallest force) to hold the river bank. The Saxon XII Corps crossed the Meuse to the Chiers, with the Prussian Guards on their right. The I Royal Bavarian Corps under General Baron von der Tann moved to Bazeilles and the Bavarian engineers deployed two pontoon bridges across the Meuse to secure their way across. The Prussian V and XI Corps completed the encirclement of the French army to the north-west by 0900 on 1 September.

==Battle==
The battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Fourth Armies, which totaled 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns.
Napoleon had ordered MacMahon to break out of the encirclement, and the only point where that seemed possible was La Moncelle, whose flank was protected by a fortified town. The Prussians also picked La Moncelle as one point where they would mount a breakthrough. Prince George of Saxony and the Prussian XI Corps was assigned to the task, and General Baron von der Tann was ordered to attack Bazeilles on the right flank.

This was the opening engagement, as the French 1st Corps had barricaded the streets, and enlisted the aid of the populace. Von der Tann sent a brigade across pontoon bridges at 04:00 in the early morning mist, the Bavarians rushing the village and capturing it through surprise. The French Marines of the 1st Corps fought back from stone houses and the Bavarian artillery shelled the buildings into rubble. The combat drew new forces, as French brigades from the 1st, 5th, and 12th Corps arrived. At 08:00 the Prussian 8th Infantry Division arrived, and von der Tann decided it was time for a decisive attack. He had not been able to bring artillery to bear from long range, so he committed his last brigade to storm the town, supported by artillery from the other side of the Meuse. His artillery reached Bazeilles at 09:00.

The fighting continued to spread to the south of the town, and the 8th Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the Bavarians fighting at La Moncelle, where they had tried to break through the French defense. Fighting began in earnest at 06:00, and the wounded MacMahon had appointed General Ducrot to command, who received the news at 07:00. Ducrot ordered the retreat that Moltke had expected, but was overruled almost immediately by General Wimpffen, who had been given a commission by the government to succeed MacMahon were he to become disabled. Wimpffen then threw his forces against the Saxons at La Moncelle. This led to a brief rally for the French, who drove back the artillery around La Moncelle and pressed the Bavarians and the Saxons. With the taking of Bazeilles at 08:00, and the arrival of fresh waves of Prussian troops, the counter-attack began to collapse.

By 11:00, Prussian artillery had taken a toll on the French, while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The Prussian V and XI Corps reached their designated positions to the west and north-west of the French army by 07:30 and 09:00, respectively. A French cavalry unit advancing west was slaughtered by Prussian infantry and artillery fire. The Prussian artillery batteries took up positions along slopes overlooking the French army.

Nonstop German artillery fire on the helpless French infantry and artillery and Prussian attacks from the northwest and east and Bavarian attacks from the southwest drove the Army of Châlons north into the Bois de la Garenne, where it was surrounded. Wimpffen at 13:00 gave orders for a breakout to the south. The attacks failed completely or did not get going at all and Douay&#x27;s 7th Corps front line was broken under the weight of German firepower. Douay&#x27;s left flank had been dug in in two lines of trenches above Floing, their fire keeping the Germans pinned down in the village. By 13:00, the German artillery had destroyed Douay&#x27;s forces and the German 22nd Division turned Douay&#x27;s left flank, defeating all counterattacks by French infantry and lancers. Douay directed General Jean Auguste Margueritte&#x27;s cavalry squadrons to open an escape route by launching three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Margueritte was mortally wounded leading the very first charge, and the two additional charges were mowed down by German infantry fire at 15:00, the number of French killed and wounded amounting to 791.

By 14:00, the German infantry had seized the Calvaire and opened fire on the huddled French masses in the Bois de la Garenne. The Germans then closed in for the kill from all sides. The French 7th Corps under Douay dissolved into a panic-stricken horde, seeking refuge in Sedan while pounded by German artillery. Ducrot&#x27;s 1st Corps was routed by the artillery of the Saxon XII Corps and the Prussian Guards Corps. The Bois de la Garenne was subject to constant German artillery fire from multiple sides and when the Prussian Guards infantry captured the forest at 14:30, the French survivors inside it surrendered &quot;en masse&quot;.

By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III terminated the attacks. He hoisted the white flag on the fortress walls of Sedan and sent General André Charles Victor Reille to deliver a letter of surrender to the Prussian Royal Headquarters on the hillside above Frénois. Wilhelm and Bismarck read the letter and Bismarck accepted it. Wimpffen attempted a last-ditch negotiation maneuver, seeking an &quot;honorable capitulation&quot; over prisoner-of-war status for the Army of Châlons, but Moltke rebuffed him, pointing to the French lack of ammunition and food, the 250,000 troops on the German side against the mere 80,000 fighting for the French and the concentric German position. Wimpffen only received the truce being prolonged until 09:00 on 2 September.

==Aftermath==

By the next day, at 11:30 on 2 September, Wimpffen signed the surrender of himself and the entire Army of Châlons to Moltke and the Prussian King. The French soldiers marched under heavy rain to an improvised German POW camp, where they starved for the next week. On 3 September, Napoleon III left for a comfortable captivity in Schloss Wilhelmshöhe near Kassel. The French prisoners of war viewed his departure with indifference.

The capture of the French emperor left the Prussians without an opposing government willing to make a quick peace. Commenting on the difficult situation, two days after news hit Paris of Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s capture, his wife said, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t he kill himself?&quot; The same day, a group of protesters stormed the Imperial palace and the Second French Empire collapsed in a bloodless revolution, leading to the creation of a Government of National Defense which would carry on the war for five more months before becoming the French Third Republic.

The defeat at Sedan and the capture of Napoleon III and France&#x27;s second line army, and with the first line French Army shut up in Metz, sealed the doom of France, thus decided the outcome of the war in Prussia&#x27;s favor. By 19 September, the Prussian Third and Fourth Armies went on to besiege Paris.

In recognition of the role this battle played in German Unification, many Germans celebrated Sedantag (Day of Sedan) on each 2 September until 1919. The Kaiser himself refused to declare 2 September an official holiday; instead, it became an unofficial day of celebration.

===Casualties===
The Germans suffered 9,860 casualties, with 1,310 men killed, 6,443 wounded and 2,107 missing. The French Army of Châlons suffered 3,220 killed, 14,811 wounded, and 104,000 captured, along with 558 guns. The French army also lost 1,000 wagons and 6,000 horses to the Germans.

<text>Majestic Records was a mid-20th century record label based in New York City, incorporated in 1945 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Majestic Radio &amp; Television. The label enjoyed its greatest commercial success in the 1940s until expansion and supplying its distributors with pressings of discs created financial problems; the label folded in 1948.

For a time in the 1940s, bandleader Ben Selvin headed the label&#x27;s artists &amp; repertory. The company was headed by former New York City mayor Jimmy Walker.

Artists who recorded on Majestic included: Jimmie Lunceford, Louis Prima, Bud Freeman, Slim Bryant, Eddy Howard, the Four Shades of Rhythm, the DeMarco Sisters, the Three Suns, Thelma Carpenter, Georgia Gibbs, Mildred Bailey, George Olsen, George Paxton and His Orchestra, Ray McKinley, Phil Regan, the Jones Brothers, Ella Logan, Jan Peerce, Jane Froman, Leon McAuliffe, Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage, Riley Shepard, the Merry Macs, and Bob Johnston.

<doc id="325784" wikidata="Q387528" url="?curid=325784" title="Manor Records">
<text>Manor Records was a jazz record label founded in the mid 1940s. Manor was run Irving Berman, who also owned Regis Records. Its catalogue included Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Tiny Bradshaw, Paul Bascomb, Sid Catlett, Jimmie Lunceford, and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.

Manor Records moved its headquarters to New Jersey. The label featured such artists on its roster as Savannah Churchill, The Sentimentalists—later famous as The Four Tunes, Luis Russell, Deek Watson and His Brown Dots, Boy Green, Skoodle-Dum-Doo (Seth Richard) and Sheffield, as well as a number of other artists.

Berman later changed the name to ARCO Records. But after 1950, tastes in the record buying public began to change and the hits were very few...consequently Berman shut down operations, and his stars went to other labels. The quality of Manor pressings was not very good, but one could probably attribute that to the war time shellac shortage, which adversely affected even the major labels during World War II.

<doc id="325785" wikidata="Q1751003" url="?curid=325785" title="No Angel">
<text>No Angel is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Dido. Originally released on 1 June 1999 in the United States, the album found a mass audience when it was released worldwide in February 2001. By 2003, the album had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, and was the second best-selling album of the 2000s in the United Kingdom, behind James Blunt&#x27;s &quot;Back to Bedlam&quot;.

As of 2015 &quot;No Angel&quot; is the 27th best-selling album in UK chart history. In 2019 it was listed the ninth best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. It was also among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the previous 30 years by the Brit Awards in 2010, ultimately losing to &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Oasis.

==Background==
Recording for the album began when Dido officially signed a record deal with Arista Records. As well as recording ten new tracks, Dido took two previously recorded tracks from her demo collection, &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot;, and used them for the album, with &quot;Take My Hand&quot; appearing in its original form, and &quot;Sweet Eyed Baby&quot; being remixed to create &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of Me&quot;. During recording for the album, a deal to release the album in the US was finalised, however, a deal to secure European sales of the album was not completed, thus meaning that when the album was released in June 1999, it was released exclusively in America. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, a promotional sampler titled &quot;The Highbury Fields EP&quot; was issued to radio stations, featuring four tracks from the album, and &quot;Worthless&quot;, another track from the demo collection &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot;.

==Singles==
The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, was initially released in the US on 17 May 1999, and it subsequently became the theme song for the popular American science fiction television series &quot;Roswell&quot;. The song reached No. 21 on the Adult Top 40 chart. It became globally available in February 2001, peaking at No. 4 in the UK. In an attempt to boost album sales, a second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of Me&quot;, was released on 7 February 2000, but it did not fare as well as expected, only peaking at No. 35 on the Adult Top 40 chart in the US, spending only seven weeks on the chart.

&quot;Thank You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single on 18 September 2000. It became the biggest hit of &quot;No Angel&quot;, reaching No. 3 in both the US and the UK, where it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry for selling over 200,000 copies in the country. It also topped several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts such as Adult Top 40, Adult Contemporary and Dance Club Songs. The album&#x27;s third European single, &quot;Hunter&quot;, was released on 18 June 2001 in the US and on 10 September 2001 in the UK, reaching the top 20 in the latter country. It spent fifteen weeks on the Adult Top 40 chart peaking at No. 16, while it became a top-10 hit on the dance charts in America. A fourth single, &quot;All You Want&quot;, was released on 10 December 2001, but it was ineligible to chart due to only being released as a 3-inch mini-single in the UK.

Some of the album tracks were later licensed for use in television programmes, with &quot;My Life&quot; appearing in an episode of the drama series &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, as well as alongside &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Honestly OK&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot; in several episodes of the Warner Bros. show &quot;Popular&quot;. &quot;My Lover&#x27;s Gone&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of Brazilian telenovela &quot;O Clone&quot; and became a smash radio hit in the country.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;No Angel&quot; as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. The album won the Best British Album accolade at the 2002 Brit Awards.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;No Angel&quot; was first released in North America on 1 June 1999 and entered the Top Heatseekers chart at number fifty a month and a half later. Twelve months after its original release, it hit number one on the chart and simultaneously entered the Billboard 200 at No. 144, which was attributed to extensive touring by Dido in clubs and small venues across the country and radio exposure in adult contemporary stations. However, &quot;No Angel&quot; continued to climb up the chart afterwards largely due to the sampling of &quot;Thank You&quot; on hit single &quot;Stan&quot; by American rapper Eminem. By January 2001, the album finally cracked the top ten of the Billboard 200 moving 17–9. Six weeks later, it reached its peak position of number-four on its 40th week on the chart, while &quot;Thank You&quot; was already a top twenty hit on the Hot 100 Airplay. &quot;No Angel&quot; spent 69 weeks on the Billboard 200 and became the 17th best-selling album of 2001 in the country. By February 2002 US sales for the album stood at a total of 2,814,000 copies sold. According to Nielsen Soundscan, the album has sold over 4.2 million units in the US and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Meanwhile, in Canada, &quot;No Angel&quot; also reached number-four on the albums chart and sold over 400,000 copies in the country, which resulted in a quadruple platinum certification by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. Additionally, the Association of Producers of Phonograms and Videograms certified the album platinum for selling over 150,000 units in Mexico.

Following the success of &quot;Stan&quot; in Australia and the UK, where it hit number one, &quot;No Angel&quot; was finally distributed in other markets outside North America in late 2000. The album made its debut on the UK Albums Chart in October of the same year at number fifty, and entered the top ten for the first time on its 14th week by climbing 11–5. By early February 2001, &quot;No Angel&quot; finally reached the top of the chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks. In early October, it returned to number-one for a seventh and final week at the top. Notably, the album re-entered the top ten on its 126th week on the chart at the end of the busy Christmas shopping period of 2003 due to the massive success of her second studio album &quot;Life for Rent&quot;. &quot;No Angel&quot; became the top-selling album of 2001 and the 27th highest-selling of 2002. Moreover, it has been recognised as the 26th best-selling album of all time in the country, with sales that exceed 3,088,700 copies, resulting in a tenfold platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Ireland, the album was listed as the second highest-selling of 2001 by the Irish Recorded Music Association, behind &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; by Robbie Williams. &quot;No Angel&quot; also experienced success in Germany, selling 750,000 units, which resulted in a triple gold certification by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie.

Furthermore, &quot;No Angel&quot; entered the Australian albums chart at number twenty-one and quickly rose to the top on its sixth week, dethroning &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; by Eminem. It remained there for eight consecutive weeks. &quot;No Angel&quot; finished 2001 as the second highest-selling album of the year, behind the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack, and was also amongst the forty best-selling records of the following year. The album received a sextuple platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association, denoting shipments of over 420,000 units in the country. In New Zealand, &quot;No Angel&quot; topped the albums chart for nine non-consecutive weeks and spent fifty-nine weeks inside the top forty. By the spring of 2002, the album had sold 75,000 copies and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand. In 2001 the album was the number 1 best-selling album, selling 8.6 million copies worldwide.

<doc id="325788" wikidata="Q7261278" url="?curid=325788" title="Puritan Records">
<text>Puritan Records was an American record label which lasted from 1917 to 1929. For most of its existence Puritan was a product of the Wisconsin Chair Company, which also marketed Paramount Records, but as a label, Puritan briefly predates Paramount and began with United Phonographs Corporation.

==History==
Frederick Dennett, founder of the Wisconsin Chair Company, had been manufacturing phonograph cabinets for Edison for several years when he decided to get into the record business himself. After selling one of his manufacturing plants to Edison, Dennett organized the United Phonographs Corporation in late 1916 and went into the production of phonograph models at the Lake Side Craft Shops building at 12th Street and Kentucky Avenue in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. By March 1917, United Phonographs began advertising the sale of phonographs and records utilizing the Puritan trademark. Vertical-cut Puritans of this era are so scarce that little is known of their provenance, though the consensus is that they must have come from other vertical-cut companies, as Wisconsin Chair is not known to have a recording studio in operation before 1919. However, they were capable of pressing records at Wisconsin Chair&#x27;s Grafton, Wisconsin facility, from 1917. This operation was formally incorporated as the New York Recording Laboratories in June of that year.

But the Puritan label, its phonographs and related business the Colonial Phonograph Company all belonged to subsidiary divisions of Wisconsin Chair. In 1919, Art Satherley established a studio in New York City for the New York Recording Laboratories (often abbreviated as &#x27;NYRL&#x27;) and Wisconsin Chair truly entered the record market with its in-house label, Paramount Records. Although the release sequence was fudged by a number of factors, from the time both companies began issuing laterals Puritan&#x27;s releases were mostly issued in lockstep with Paramount, with some considerable exceptions.

Frederick Dennett died in 1920, and in 1922 his successors at United Phonographs Corporation decided to get out of the phonograph business, at which point the Puritan imprint transferred to Wisconsin Chair. For a time afterwards, Puritan records were being pressed by both NYRL in Grafton and by the Bridgeport Die and Machine Company (commonly abbreviated as &#x27;BD&amp;M&#x27;) in Bridgeport, CT. The NYRL masters were also published on dozens of other labels that were serviced by BD&amp;M such as Banner Records, Triangle and Paramount&#x27;s sister labels Broadway Records and Famous.

BD&amp;M went bankrupt in 1925, and NYRL dissolved by court order on January 1, 1926. Yet Puritan continued to operate until 1929, using masters from companies such as Regal Records (1921). Puritan&#x27;s releases reflected the output of Paramount&#x27;s New York facility, issuing mainstream dance records and popular songs. It continued to do so, for a short time, after the parent label turned its undivided attention to country music and blues, recorded in and around Chicago and by Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana.

==Label Design and numbering systems==

United Phonographs-era Puritans employ at least three, distinct label designs. The four-colour vertical-cut label features tan and blue overprinting on a light grey background with an inset image of a pilgrim woman listening to her phonograph at fireside; the words &quot;Vertical Cut&quot; appear in red type. With the advent of laterals, the image of the pilgrim woman was kept, but surrounded by fancy lacework in a label printed in varying degrees of gold and black. Near the end of the United Phonographs period, the inset image was replaced by a legend, &quot;America&#x27;s Best Record.&quot; This was retained, with a small amount of the lacework, on the far simpler label design used by NYRL which is gold on blue, similar to Paramount&#x27;s own design. Around 1925, the label changed from gold on blue to gold on black. BD&amp;M pressings, however, employ their own unique label design of gold and white on black, with an inset profile of the Puritan of legend in a broad-brimmed hat.

Very little information is available about the numbering systems of the earliest Puritans and Paramounts, though vertical-cut Puritans were numbered in the 2000s. With switching to lateral-cut in 1919, Puritan ran at least three concurrent series, 6000 for classical, 9000 for light music and 11000 for popular, though the classical line didn&#x27;t last beyond 1923. The Puritan 11000 series corresponds to releases in the Paramount 20000 series and the 9000 series reflects Paramount&#x27;s 33000 series; there are other Puritan series known in number blocks of 500 and 70000. Once BD&amp;M gets into the mix, the numerical relationship between Puritan and Paramount becomes considerably disturbed, with different records sharing the same numbers. About 1923, the 11000 system stabilizes until the end, the highest known Puritan release in the pop series being 11819 in 1929. By then the parallel pop release program on Paramount had already concluded.

==Legacy==
Like the products of its parent, Puritan records are relatively scarce, although they are more common than Paramounts. None of the country or Downhome blues for which Paramount is now famous appeared on Puritan. It was devoted to popular and dance selections, made by usual suspect orchestras based in New York City such as those of Ben Selvin, Joseph Samuels, Nathan Glantz, Eddie Davis (working out of Mike Markel&#x27;s orchestra), Harry Yerkes and so forth. A large part of Puritan&#x27;s release schedule was also carried on more common labels such as Plaza Music&#x27;s Banner Records or scarcer imprints such as Broadway and Triangle. Puritan is a desirable imprint for some collectors and it is of value in the light it sheds on Paramount; from a discographical standpoint it is of interest as so many aspects of Puritan&#x27;s release schedule remain unresolved. However, nothing on Puritan enters into the high dollar value accorded to the country and blues releases on Paramount proper, though certain items, such by Lucille Hegamin, King Oliver, Ford Dabney, W. C. Handy and some early Fletcher Henderson and Duke Ellington titles, are not negligible in that regard.

Quality of sound tends to vary on Puritan. BD&amp;M pressings sound better, but are more fragile, whereas NYRL Wisconsin pressings are more durable, but are noisier owing to the high amount of filler in the shellac formula.

In 1972, record collector Dave Samuelson licensed the name for an independent label devoted to American roots and bluegrass music. It used the same typeface, label and logo design as later Puritan issues of the 1920s, but bore no other relationship to the earlier label. Originally based in Evanston, Illinois, it moved to Battle Ground, Indiana in 1975 and ceased operations in 1981.

<text>Architectural state is the collection of information in a computer system that defines the state of a program during execution. Architectural state includes main memory, architectural registers, and the program counter. Architectural state is defined by the instruction set architecture and can be manipulated by the programmer using instructions. A core dump is a file recording the architectural state of a computer program at some point in time, such as when it has crashed. 

Examples of architectural state include:
* Main Memory (Primary storage)
* Control registers
** Instruction flag registers (such as EFLAGS in x86)
**Interrupt mask registers
** Memory management unit registers
** Status registers
* General purpose registers (such as AX, BX, CX, DX, etc. in x86)
**Address registers
**Counter registers
**Index registers
**Stack registers
** String registers

Architectural state is not microarchitectural state. Microarchitectural state is hidden machine state used for implementing the microarchitecture. Examples of microarchitectural state include pipeline registers, cache tags, and branch predictor state. While microarchitectural state can change to suit the needs of each processor implementation in a processor family, binary compatibility among processors in a processor family requires a common architectural state. 

Architectural state naturally does not include state-less elements of a computer such as busses and computation units (e.g., the ALU).

<text>Hans Bronsart von Schellendorf (11 February 18303 November 1913) was a classical musician and composer who studied under Franz Liszt.

==Biography==
Hans Bronsart von Schellendorf (also called Hans von Bronsart) was born into a Prussian military family, to the lieutenant general . He was educated at Berlin University and studied piano with Adolph Jullack. He went to Weimar in 1853 where he met Franz Liszt and became familiar with all the musicians in Liszt&#x27;s circle at the time, including Hector Berlioz and Johannes Brahms. It is a measure of his close relationship with Liszt that it was he who played the solo part in the first Weimar performance of Liszt&#x27;s 2nd Piano Concerto, with the composer conducting. When the concerto was published, Liszt dedicated it to Bronsart. After having trained for several years with Liszt, he worked as a conductor in Leipzig and Berlin, and then took the post of general manager of the Royal Theatre in Hanover from 1867 to 1887. He held a similar post in Weimar from 1887 until his retirement in 1895.

He met his second wife Ingeborg Bronsart von Schellendorf (née Ingeborg Lena Starck) (1840–1913), also a composer, in Weimar. They married in 1861.

Bronsart von Schellendorff died in Munich in 1913.

==Compositions==
Bronsart von Schellendorf&#x27;s compositions include
* Piano Trio in G minor, Op. 1
* Piano Concerto in F-sharp minor, Op. 10
* Symphony No. 1 &quot;In die Alpen&quot; for choir and orchestra (lost)
* Symphony No. 2 &quot;Schicksalsgewalten&quot; (lost)
* &quot;Fruhlings-Fantasie&quot; for orchestra
* &quot;Christnacht&quot;, cantata
* &quot;Der Corsar&quot;, opera
* String Sextet
* solo piano pieces.

His piano concerto was much favoured by Hans von Bülow, who rated the work as the &quot;most significant one of the so-called Weimar school&quot;. It was recorded in 1973 by Michael Ponti, in 2017 by Emmanuel Despax for Hyperion Records, and in 2022 by Paul Wee for BIS Records.

Both Bronsart and his wife receive many mentions in Liszt&#x27;s letters. Liszt clearly held their compositions in high regard. In a letter from 12 May 1879, to Walter Bache, he writes &quot;On 5th June Bülow conducts the first concert there, at which Bronsart&#x27;s beautiful and valuable &quot;Fruhlings-Fantasie&quot;, Bülow&#x27;s music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and my &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; will be performed.&quot;

<text>In discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory, a graph is a structure consisting of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are in some sense &quot;related&quot;. The objects are represented by abstractions called &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an &quot;edge&quot; (also called &quot;link&quot; or &quot;line&quot;). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.

The edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person &quot;A&quot; can shake hands with a person &quot;B&quot; only if &quot;B&quot; also shakes hands with &quot;A&quot;. In contrast, if an edge from a person &quot;A&quot; to a person &quot;B&quot; means that &quot;A&quot; owes money to &quot;B&quot;, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.

Graphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. The word &quot;graph&quot; was first used in this sense by J. J. Sylvester in 1878 due to a direct relation between mathematics and chemical structure (what he called a chemico-graphical image).

== Definitions ==
Definitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.

=== Graph ===
A graph (sometimes called an &quot;undirected graph&quot; to distinguish it from a directed graph, or a &quot;simple graph&quot; to distinguish it from a multigraph) is a pair , where is a set whose elements are called &quot;vertices&quot; (singular: vertex), and is a set of unordered pairs formula_1 of vertices, whose elements are called &quot;edges&quot; (sometimes &quot;links&quot; or &quot;lines&quot;).

The vertices and of an edge are called the edge&#x27;s &quot;endpoints&quot;. The edge is said to &quot;join&quot; and and to be &quot;incident&quot; on them. A vertex may belong to no edge, in which case it is not joined to any other vertex and is called &quot;isolated&quot;. When an edge formula_2 exists, the vertices and are called &quot;adjacent&quot;.

A multigraph is a generalization that allows multiple edges to have the same pair of endpoints. In some texts, multigraphs are simply called graphs.

Sometimes, graphs are allowed to contain &quot;loops&quot;, which are edges that join a vertex to itself. To allow loops, the pairs of vertices in must be allowed to have the same node twice. Such generalized graphs are called &quot;graphs with loops&quot; or simply &quot;graphs&quot; when it is clear from the context that loops are allowed.

Generally, the vertex set is taken to be finite (which implies that the edge set is also finite). Sometimes infinite graphs are considered, but they are usually viewed as a special kind of binary relation, because most results on finite graphs either do not extend to the infinite case or need a rather different proof.

An empty graph is a graph that has an empty set of vertices (and thus an empty set of edges). The &quot;order&quot; of a graph is its number of vertices, usually denoted by . The &quot;size&quot; of a graph is its number of edges, typically denoted by . However, in some contexts, such as for expressing the computational complexity of algorithms, the term &quot;size&quot; is used for the quantity (otherwise, a non-empty graph could have size 0). The &quot;degree&quot; or &quot;valency&quot; of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to it; for graphs with loops, a loop is counted twice.

In a graph of order , the maximum degree of each vertex is (or if loops are allowed, because a loop contributes 2 to the degree), and the maximum number of edges is (or if loops are allowed).

The edges of a graph define a symmetric relation on the vertices, called the &quot;adjacency relation&quot;. Specifically, two vertices and are &quot;adjacent&quot; if is an edge. A graph is fully determined by its adjacency matrix , which is an square matrix, with specifying the number of connections from vertex to vertex . For a simple graph, is either 0, indicating disconnection, or 1, indicating connection; moreover because an edge in a simple graph cannot start and end at the same vertex. Graphs with self-loops will be characterized by some or all being equal to a positive integer, and multigraphs (with multiple edges between vertices) will be characterized by some or all being equal to a positive integer. Undirected graphs will have a symmetric adjacency matrix (meaning ).

=== Directed graph ===

A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.

In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a directed graph is a pair comprising:
* , a set of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;);
* , a set of &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;directed edges&quot;, &quot;directed links&quot;, &quot;directed lines&quot;, &quot;arrows&quot;, or &quot;arcs&quot;), which are ordered pairs of distinct vertices: formula_3.
To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed simple graph.

In the edge directed from to , the vertices and are called the &quot;endpoints&quot; of the edge, the &quot;tail&quot; of the edge and the &quot;head&quot; of the edge. The edge is said to &quot;join&quot; and and to be &quot;incident&quot; on and on . A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge is called the &quot;inverted edge&quot; of . &quot;Multiple edges&quot;, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head.

In one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges, a directed graph is sometimes defined to be an ordered triple comprising:
* , a set of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;);
* , a set of &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;directed edges&quot;, &quot;directed links&quot;, &quot;directed lines&quot;, &quot;arrows&quot; or &quot;arcs&quot;);
* , an &quot;incidence function&quot; mapping every edge to an ordered pair of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices): formula_4.

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed multigraph.

A &quot;loop&quot; is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Directed graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex formula_5 to itself is the edge (for a directed simple graph) or is incident on (for a directed multigraph) formula_6 which is not in formula_7. So to allow loops the definitions must be expanded. For directed simple graphs, the definition of formula_8 should be modified to formula_9. For directed multigraphs, the definition of formula_10 should be modified to formula_11. To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called precisely a directed simple graph permitting loops and a directed multigraph permitting loops (or a &quot;quiver&quot;) respectively.

The edges of a directed simple graph permitting loops is a homogeneous relation ~ on the vertices of that is called the &quot;adjacency relation&quot; of . Specifically, for each edge , its endpoints and are said to be &quot;adjacent&quot; to one another, which is denoted .

=== Mixed graph ===

A &quot;mixed graph&quot; is a graph in which some edges may be directed and some may be undirected. It is an ordered triple for a &quot;mixed simple graph&quot; and for a &quot;mixed multigraph&quot; with , (the undirected edges), (the directed edges), and defined as above. Directed and undirected graphs are special cases.

=== Weighted graph ===
A &quot;weighted graph&quot; or a &quot;network&quot; is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.

== Types of graphs ==
=== Oriented graph ===
One definition of an &quot;oriented graph&quot; is that it is a directed graph in which at most one of and may be edges of the graph. That is, it is a directed graph that can be formed as an orientation of an undirected (simple) graph. 

Some authors use &quot;oriented graph&quot; to mean the same as &quot;directed graph&quot;. Some authors use &quot;oriented graph&quot; to mean any orientation of a given undirected graph or multigraph.

=== Regular graph ===

A &quot;regular graph&quot; is a graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex has the same degree. A regular graph with vertices of degree &quot;k&quot; is called a &quot;k&quot;‑regular graph or regular graph of degree &quot;k&quot;.

=== Complete graph ===

A &quot;complete graph&quot; is a graph in which each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. A complete graph contains all possible edges.

=== Finite graph ===
A &quot;finite graph&quot; is a graph in which the vertex set and the edge set are finite sets. Otherwise, it is called an &quot;infinite graph&quot;.

Most commonly in graph theory it is implied that the graphs discussed are finite. If the graphs are infinite, that is usually specifically stated.

=== Connected graph ===

In an undirected graph, an unordered pair of vertices is called &quot;connected&quot; if a path leads from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. Otherwise, the unordered pair is called &quot;disconnected&quot;.

A &quot;connected graph&quot; is an undirected graph in which every unordered pair of vertices in the graph is connected. Otherwise, it is called a &quot;disconnected graph&quot;.

In a directed graph, an ordered pair of vertices is called &quot;strongly connected&quot; if a directed path leads from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called &quot;weakly connected&quot; if an undirected path leads from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; after replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called &quot;disconnected&quot;.

A &quot;strongly connected graph&quot; is a directed graph in which every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is strongly connected. Otherwise, it is called a &quot;weakly connected graph&quot; if every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is weakly connected. Otherwise it is called a &quot;disconnected graph&quot;.

A &quot;k-vertex-connected graph&quot; or &quot;k-edge-connected graph&quot; is a graph in which no set of vertices (respectively, edges) exists that, when removed, disconnects the graph. A &quot;k&quot;-vertex-connected graph is often called simply a &quot;k-connected graph&quot;.

=== Bipartite graph ===

A &quot;bipartite graph&quot; is a simple graph in which the vertex set can be partitioned into two sets, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, so that no two vertices in &quot;W&quot; share a common edge and no two vertices in &quot;X&quot; share a common edge. Alternatively, it is a graph with a chromatic number of 2.

In a complete bipartite graph, the vertex set is the union of two disjoint sets, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, so that every vertex in &quot;W&quot; is adjacent to every vertex in &quot;X&quot; but there are no edges within &quot;W&quot; or &quot;X&quot;.

=== Path graph ===

A &quot;path graph&quot; or &quot;linear graph&quot; of order is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2, …, &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; such that the edges are the where &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; − 1. Path graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all but two vertices is 2 and the degree of the two remaining vertices is 1. If a path graph occurs as a subgraph of another graph, it is a path in that graph.

=== Planar graph ===

A &quot;planar graph&quot; is a graph whose vertices and edges can be drawn in a plane such that no two of the edges intersect.

=== Cycle graph ===

A &quot;cycle graph&quot; or &quot;circular graph&quot; of order is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2, …, &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; such that the edges are the where &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; − 1, plus the edge . Cycle graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all vertices is 2. If a cycle graph occurs as a subgraph of another graph, it is a cycle or circuit in that graph.

=== Tree ===

A &quot;tree&quot; is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by &quot;exactly one&quot; path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.

A &quot;forest&quot; is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by &quot;at most one&quot; path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.

=== Polytree ===
A &quot;polytree&quot; (or &quot;directed tree&quot; or &quot;oriented tree&quot; or &quot;singly connected network&quot;) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.

A &quot;polyforest&quot; (or &quot;directed forest&quot; or &quot;oriented forest&quot;) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest.

=== Advanced classes ===
More advanced kinds of graphs are:
* Petersen graph and its generalizations;
* perfect graphs;
* cographs;
* chordal graphs;
* other graphs with large automorphism groups: vertex-transitive, arc-transitive, and distance-transitive graphs;
* strongly regular graphs and their generalizations distance-regular graphs.

== Properties of graphs ==

Two edges of a graph are called &quot;adjacent&quot; if they share a common vertex. Two edges of a directed graph are called &quot;consecutive&quot; if the head of the first one is the tail of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called &quot;adjacent&quot; if they share a common edge (&quot;consecutive&quot; if the first one is the tail and the second one is the head of an edge), in which case the common edge is said to &quot;join&quot; the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called &quot;incident&quot;.

The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the &quot;trivial graph&quot;. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an &quot;edgeless graph&quot;. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the &quot;null graph&quot; or &quot;empty graph&quot;, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.

Normally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called &quot;vertex-labeled&quot;. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges.) The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called &quot;edge-labeled&quot;. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as &quot;labeled&quot;. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called &quot;unlabeled&quot;. (In the literature, the term &quot;labeled&quot; may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)

The category of all graphs is the comma category Set ↓ &quot;D&quot; where &quot;D&quot;: Set → Set is the functor taking a set &quot;s&quot; to &quot;s&quot; × &quot;s&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The diagram is a schematic representation of the graph with vertices formula_12 and edges formula_13
* In computer science, directed graphs are used to represent knowledge (e.g., conceptual graph), finite-state machines, and many other discrete structures.
* A binary relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; defines a directed graph. An element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is a direct predecessor of an element &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; if and only if &quot;xRy&quot;.
* A directed graph can model information networks such as Twitter, with one user following another. 
*Particularly regular examples of directed graphs are given by the Cayley graphs of finitely-generated groups, as well as Schreier coset graphs
*In category theory, every small category has an underlying directed multigraph whose vertices are the objects of the category, and whose edges are the arrows of the category. In the language of category theory, one says that there is a forgetful functor from the category of small categories to the category of quivers.

== Graph operations ==

There are several operations that produce new graphs from initial ones, which might be classified into the following categories:
* &quot;unary operations&quot;, which create a new graph from an initial one, such as:
** edge contraction,
** line graph,
** dual graph,
** complement graph,
** graph rewriting;
* &quot;binary operations&quot;, which create a new graph from two initial ones, such as:
** disjoint union of graphs,
** cartesian product of graphs,
** tensor product of graphs,
** strong product of graphs,
** lexicographic product of graphs,
** series–parallel graphs.

== Generalizations ==
In a hypergraph, an edge can join any positive number of vertices.

An undirected graph can be seen as a simplicial complex consisting of 1-simplices (the edges) and 0-simplices (the vertices). As such, complexes are generalizations of graphs since they allow for higher-dimensional simplices.

Every graph gives rise to a matroid.

In model theory, a graph is just a structure. But in that case, there is no limitation on the number of edges: it can be any cardinal number, see continuous graph.

In computational biology, power graph analysis introduces power graphs as an alternative representation of undirected graphs.

In geographic information systems, geometric networks are closely modeled after graphs, and borrow many concepts from graph theory to perform spatial analysis on road networks or utility grids.

<text>Airfix is a British brand and former manufacturing company which produced injection-moulded plastic scale model kits. In the UK, the name &#x27;Airfix&#x27; has become practically synonymous with plastic models of this type, &quot;they became a sort of generic name for any plastic, injection-moulded model kit&quot;.

Airfix manufactured a wide range of plastic model products such as cars, aircraft, ships, commercial vehicles, military vehicles, railways, and figures. Founded in 1939, Airfix was owned by Humbrol from 1986 until the latter&#x27;s financial collapse on 31 August 2006. Since 2007, both Humbrol and Airfix have been owned by Hornby.

== History ==
Airfix was founded in 1939 by Hungarian businessman Nicholas Kove, initially to manufacture inflatable rubber toys. The brand name was selected so that it would be alphabetically the first in trade directories. In 1947, Airfix introduced injection moulding, initially producing pocket combs. In 1949, the company was commissioned to create a promotional model of a Ferguson TE20 tractor, moulded in cellulose acetate plastic and hand-assembled for distribution to Ferguson sales representatives. To increase sales and lower production costs, the model was sold in kit form by Woolworth&#x27;s retail stores.

In 1954, Woolworth&#x27;s buyer Jim Russon suggested that Airfix produce a model kit of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, then being sold in North America as a &#x27;ship-in-a-bottle&#x27;, made in the more stable polystyrene. To meet Woolworth&#x27;s retail price of two shillings, Airfix packaged the product in a plastic bag with a paper header that had the assembly instructions on the reverse. Its huge success led the company to produce new kit designs. The first aircraft kit was released in 1953, a model of the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I, followed by the Spitfire Mk IX in 1958, in scale, developed by James Hay Stevens. This was a scaled-down copy of the Aurora Supermarine Spitfire kit, although it is unknown if this kit was produced with authorization from Aurora. Kove initially refused to believe the product would sell and threatened to charge the cost of tooling-up to the designers.

Airfix later received complaint letters from modellers and former Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel regarding inaccuracies of the 1/72 Spitfire Mk I that were carried over from the original 1/48 Aurora model, particularly the BTK squadron code provided in the decal sheet (the code never adorned a Spitfire in real life, as it was used by a squadron operating the Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplane). One of the complaints came from modeller John Edwards, who was appointed as Airfix&#x27;s chief designer after convincing the company that he can improve their aircraft kits. Edwards helped release a more accurate Spitfire Mk IX model in 1955, and he would go on to direct the designs of Airfix kits in other ranges for 15 more years until his untimely death at the age of 38.

=== Expansion ===

During the 1960s and 1970s, the company expanded as the hobby grew. The range expanded to include vintage and modern cars, motorcycles, figures in both and scale, trains, model railway accessories, military vehicles, ships, rockets and spaceships, as well as an ever-increasing range of aircraft, most created at the scales of for small and military aircraft and scale for airliners. The growth of the hobby launched a number of competitors such as Matchbox and introduced new manufacturers from Japan and the US to the UK. During this period the Humbrol company also grew, supplying paints, brushes, glue and other accessories as an alternative to Airfix&#x27;s own range. Airfix also launched a monthly modelling magazine, &quot;Airfix Magazine&quot;, produced by a variety of publishers from June 1960 to October 1993. During the 1970s, an &quot;Airfix Magazine Annual&quot; was also produced; and Airfix books on classic aircraft, classic ships and modelling techniques were published by Patrick Stephens Ltd.

In 1963, the Airfix slot car racing system was introduced. Airfix produced cars with front-wheel Ackermann steering and, later, conversion kits so that normal Airfix kit cars such as the Ford Zodiac and the Sunbeam Rapier could be raced. The first set had Ferrari and Cooper cars and an 11-foot figure-of-eight track: it cost £4/19/11d. Always in the shadow of the Scalextric range, the Airfix version attempted to progress with the higher-end Model Road Racing Company (MRRC) range but eventually the venture was abandoned.

Most of Airfix&#x27;s older range of military vehicles, though sold as , are generally accepted as OO or scale - the subsequent introduction of a small number of true  vehicle kits to the Airfix range created controversy regarding the exact scale. Hornby&#x27;s new packaging shows or as appropriate.

In late 1962, the acquisition of the intellectual property and 35 moulds of Rosebud Kitmaster gave Airfix its first models of railway locomotives in OO and HO scales and its first motorcycle kit; the Ariel Arrow in scale. The &#x27;60&#x27;s also saw the introduction of an extremely popular line of boxed scale military figures.

In the mid-1970s, larger scales were introduced, including detailed -scale models of the Spitfire, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Hawker Hurricane and Harrier &quot;jump-jet&quot;. The mid-1970s were a peak time for Airfix. Releasing as many as 17 new kits a year, Airfix commanded 75% of the UK market with 20 million kits per annum. Series 20 was limited for several years to the 1972 scale kit of the 1930 Supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre car, with 272 parts and the option of a 3-volt motor. In 1979 four motorcycles in scale were added to this series. The company also introduced an addition to the very popular plastic soldier boxed set line with a scale version.

In this period, apart from model kits, Airfix also produced a wide range of toys, games, dolls and art &amp; craft products. It was still producing other plastic products such as homewares at this time. Airfix Industries acquired part of the failing Lines Brothers&#x27; huge Tri-ang toy business, then in voluntary liquidation, giving it the Meccano and Dinky Toys businesses in 1971. This made Airfix the UK&#x27;s largest toy company.

=== Decline, purchase by Humbrol ===
In the 1980s, Airfix Industries group was under financial pressure, there were losses in Airfix&#x27;s other toy businesses and attempts to reduce costs were met with industrial action. The pound strengthened from to in a matter of months, destroying export markets, because customers were unwilling to accept a 50% price increase for the same goods. The financial interdependency of the divisions of Airfix Industries forced it to declare bankruptcy in 1981. The company was bought by General Mills (owner of US automobile kit-maker MPC) through its UK Palitoy subsidiary. The kit moulds were sent to their factory in Calais, France. Later, Airfix aircraft kits were marketed in the United States under the MPC label and some MPC kits were sold in the UK under the Airfix name (an example being the scale vintage Stutz Bearcat kit originally produced as a tie-in to the &quot;Bearcats!&quot; television series). Airfix released MPC kits based on the Star Wars film series.

Airfix&#x27;s market share reduced to 40% of the UK market (2.3 million kits) though it had 75% of the German market. In the US, where automobile kits were more popular than aircraft, it was less than 2%.

Four years later, General Mills withdrew from the toy market to focus on its core food manufacturing business. At one point, it looked as if the Airfix range might be discontinued with no new toolings released from 1986 to 1987. Eventually around this time, it was bought by the Hobby Products Group of Borden, Inc., which had tried to buy the range in 1981. Borden was also the owner of Humbrol. The moulds remained in France but were relocated to the group&#x27;s existing kit-manufacturer, Trun-based Heller SA. This was a logical acquisition since Humbrol&#x27;s paints and adhesives could be used to complete Airfix kits and the Heller factory was under-utilised.

The Hobby Products Group was sold to an Irish investment company, Allen &amp; McGuire, in 1994 and continued under the Humbrol name.

=== 50th anniversary ===
In 2003, Airfix celebrated the 50th anniversary of its first aircraft kit, the Supermarine Spitfire. The celebration was two years early because of an incorrect 1953 date commonly accepted at the time. As the moulds for the original kit were long gone, Airfix reissued its Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Ιa kit in blue plastic. The kit also included a large Series 5 stand (the moulds for the smaller Series 1 stand having been lost) and a copy of the original plastic bag packaging with paper header.

=== Demise of Humbrol and acquisition by Hornby ===

On 31 August 2006, parent company Humbrol went into administration, 31 of 41 employees being made redundant, largely because of the collapse of Heller SA, which still manufactured most of Airfix&#x27;s kits. On 10 November 2006, Hornby Hobbies Ltd. announced it was to acquire Airfix and other assets of Humbrol for £2.6 million, and relaunched the brands the following year. In 2008, Airfix&#x27;s former factory in Kingston upon Hull was demolished.

=== Hornby era ===
Under the management of Hornby, Airfix was revitalised. Old ranges were re-issued, and Airfix launched several new kits annually. Most manufacturing of Airfix products is in India, while design and packing is in the UK.

Airfix was the first company to release small-scale military vehicles in 1960 with the 1:72 Bristol Bloodhound with Launcher, SWB Land Rover and trailer. The original range of vehicles was in 1:76 scale, also known as OO scale. Also, a range of Military Vehicles sets was produced, such as the &quot;RAF Refuelling Set&quot;, the &quot;RAF Recovery Vehicle Set&quot;, and the &quot;Airfield Fire Rescue Set&quot; with accessories that could be used in dioramas.

=== Diorama sets ===
HO/OO scale World War II scenes including the &quot;Battlefront History&quot; series, consisting of a number of OO/HO vehicle or 1/72 aircraft kits and sets of OO/HO wargaming figures, presented on a vacuum-formed base. Also the &quot;Rampaging Scorpion&quot; and &quot;Colossal Mantis&quot; science fiction dioramas, which were re-boxed MPC kits. A new series of Airfield Sets has recently been released, with Aircraft, Military Vehicles and Figures included in the box.

=== Figures ===
1:76, 1:72 and 1:32 scales. Sets of mostly military figures (approximately 14 to 30 per box for 1:32, 30 to 50 per box for 1:72), of subjects such as World War I, World War II and Modern Infantry, Waterloo, Arab Tribesmen, etc. These are made of polythene, a soft durable plastic. Some vehicles of simpler casting and detail than their polystyrene equivalents and buildings were also available and included in larger playsets, e.g., the Coastal Defence Assault Set which included polythene tanks and infantry for either side plus a polystyrene Coastal Defence Fort kit. Collectors of vintage toy soldiers have reported brittling and disintegration of Airfix scale plastic figures, though not as an age-related effect

Airfix also produced a small number of Card Construction kits for use with the Airfix Railway System. These were included with some Airfix GMR Train Sets. And various structures as the &quot;Airfield Control Tower&quot; and the &quot;Pontoon Bridge&quot;.

== Box art ==
Many artists have produced artwork for Airfix kit packaging, most famously Roy Cross.

== Model railways ==
In 1962 Airfix bought from Rosebud Kitmaster Ltd, its moulds and stock for the Kitmaster railway range. The models were adapted to be compatible with Airfix&#x27;s rolling stock models produced from 1960 which went with Airfix&#x27;s trackside accessories of a few years earlier. Only ten of the Kitmaster locomotives were released under Airfix.

From 1975 to 1981 Airfix also manufactured a line of ready-to-run models of British railway stock in OO gauge ( scale). Their details and accuracy were an improvement on rival products from other British manufacturers such as Hornby. The product range expanded rapidly. A model of a Great Western Railway (GWR) 0-4-2 autotank steam locomotive and GWR auto coach are amongst some of the many memorable and important product releases. Airfix also offered an analogue electronics-based multiple train control system (MTC) allowing independent control of locomotives on the same track. Airfix produced a large number of plastic kits for both railway stock and scenic items. Some of these such as the footbridge and engine shed became instantly recognisable to almost every railway modeller in the UK.

The brand label was changed to Great Model Railways (GMR) in 1979, although the Airfix name was still included. However, Airfix left the model railway business in 1981. The models were sold to one of its main competitors Palitoy which produced the Mainline range of products. The former Airfix moulds together with the Palitoy-designed 2P 4-4-0 and Class 56 diesel were later re-sold to Dapol Ltd and then subsequently to Hornby. Dapol provided new chassis for the 14xx and Castle. The remainder of the Mainline Railways had been produced for Palitoy by Kader Industries and ownership of those tools remained with Kader, is later used to form the basis of the Bachmann Branchline models. Dapol continues to produce (but not promote) most of the kits but as the moulds (some now over forty years old) wear out the kits are being discontinued. Hornby continues to make 4 mm/ft scale models from the Airfix mouldings.

A monthly magazine, &quot;Model Trains&quot;, was published by Airfix from January 1980. The magazine included especially good articles aimed at newcomers to the hobby and also included many articles about modelling US and Continental European railways, as well British prototype railways. The publication of &quot;Model Trains&quot; continued for some years after Airfix ceased ownership in 1981. A change in the editorial team saw the original &quot;Model Trains&quot; editorial staff launch a new title as &quot;Scale Trains&quot;, in April 1982. A slight name change followed in April 1984, as &quot;Scale Model Trains&quot; following the final issue of &quot;Model Trains&quot; in December 1983. &quot;Scale Model Trains&quot; ran until June 1995, when a new publisher was found and the magazine was relaunched in 1995 as &quot;Model Trains International&quot;, the November/December issue being issue number 1. It continues to be published.

== Video game ==

In 2000, EON Digital Entertainment released &quot;Airfix Dogfighter&quot; for Microsoft Windows. The game featured computer representation of Airfix&#x27;s Second World War-era model aircraft with a total of over 15 playable aircraft, including the German Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, and the American Grumman F6F Hellcat. The game featured 20 missions, allowing players to play 10 missions as both the Axis and Allies. Players fought their way through the game&#x27;s 1950s-era house, destroying enemy planes while trying to collect healing glue packets, new model kits, weapons schematics, and paint to customise their aircraft for online battles. Pilots would battle enemy model aircraft as well as U-boats, warships, tanks, flak guns, airships, and fortresses. Players could also design their own fighting emblem, call sign, and even their own battle maps based on the missions in the game. The whole game was an advertising venture, as the paints are Humbrol and the kit upgrades show actual pictures of Airfix packages.

== In popular culture ==
The Airfix history has ensured that the company, its products and its brand has entered modern culture, especially in the Anglo-centric world, in its own right. In 2008, a TV advertisement for the Santander bank was produced, featuring a fictitious Lewis Hamilton Formula One car model. Demand for this model was such that Airfix later produced a real model kit using the tooling from a similar Scalextric slot car.

A life-size model of a Spitfire in the style of an Airfix kit was made as part of the BBC TV series &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot; in 2009. The markings of the life-sized model paid homage to Airfix&#x27;s first aircraft kit released in 1953, including the erroneous BTK squadron code.

In one of the &#x27;Eric and Ernie at Home&#x27; Sketches in the &#x27;Morecambe and Wise Show&#x27;, Eric Morecambe is seen adding the final touches to the Airfix 1/24 Supermarine Spitfire Mk.1 

Reference is made to Airfix in the BBC drama &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; series 3 episode 6 when Timothy Turner asks his step-mother &quot;can I show Colin my Airfix Supermarine Spitfire?&quot;

Airfix kits were extensively used to create futuristic aircraft in the TV series Thunderbirds, the Airfix girder bridge also features in one of the episodes. A shop existed in the Elstree Borehamwood film studios from which Airfix kit components could be bought in the 1970&#x27;s. This meant that space ships from the first Star Wars film (Episode 4, 1976) featured such components in the small Millennium Falcon models used in long shots. (This information was stated in the 1996 Star Wars exhibition cited in London&#x27;s Barbican centre). These may have also been used for the space ship models in Alien (1979) by Ridley Scott.
