<text>Sacred Harp singing is a tradition of sacred choral music that originated in New England and was later perpetuated and carried on in the American South. The name is derived from &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, a ubiquitous and historically important tunebook printed in shape notes. The work was first published in 1844 and has reappeared in multiple editions ever since. Sacred Harp music represents one branch of an older tradition of American music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in New England, with a significant, related development under the influence of &quot;revival&quot; services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the shape note style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Sacred Harp music is performed &quot;a cappella&quot; (voice only, without instruments) and originated as Protestant music.

== The music and its notation ==

The name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape-note book from which the music is sung, &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. This book exists today in various editions, discussed below.

In shape-note music, notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader identify them on the musical scale. There are two prevalent systems, one using four shapes, and one using seven. In the four-shape system used in &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable, &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, or &quot;mi&quot;, and these syllables are employed in singing the notes, just as in the more familiar system that uses &quot;do&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, etc. (see solfege). The four-shape system is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable-shape combination other than &quot;mi&quot; is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale. For example, the C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:

The shape for &quot;fa&quot; is a triangle, &quot;sol&quot; an oval, &quot;la&quot; a rectangle, and &quot;mi&quot; a diamond.

In Sacred Harp singing, pitch is not absolute. The shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale, not particular pitches. Thus for a song in the key of C, &quot;fa&quot; designates C and F; for a song in G, &quot;fa&quot; designates G and C, and so on; hence it is called a &quot;moveable &quot;do&quot;&quot; system.

When Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help with the task of sight reading. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words.

==Singing Sacred Harp music==

Sacred Harp groups always sing a cappella, that is to say, without accompanying instruments. The singers arrange themselves in a hollow square, with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts: treble, alto, tenor, and bass. The treble and tenor sections are usually mixed, with men and women singing the notes an octave apart.

There is no single leader or conductor; rather, the participants take turns in leading. The leader for a particular round selects a song from the book, and &quot;calls&quot; it by its page number. Leading is done in an open-palm style, standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors.

The pitch at which the music is sung is relative; there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point. The leader, or else some particular singer assigned to the task, finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group. The singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts, and then the song begins immediately.

The music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book, but with certain deviations established by custom.

As the name implies, Sacred Harp music is sacred music and originated as Protestant Christian music. Many of the songs in the book are hymns that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant hymnody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from &quot;mainstream&quot; Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as fuguing tunes, contain sections that are polyphonic in texture, and the harmony tends to deemphasize the interval of the third in favor of fourths and fifths. In their melodies, the songs often use the pentatonic scale or similar &quot;gapped&quot; (fewer than seven-note) scales.

In their musical form, Sacred Harp songs fall into three basic types. Many are ordinary &quot;hymn tunes&quot;, mostly composed in four-bar phrases and sung in multiple verses. &quot;Fuguing tunes&quot; contain a prominent passage about 1/3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession, in a way resembling a fugue. &quot;Anthems&quot; are longer songs, less regular in form, that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses.

===Venues for singing===

Sacred Harp singing normally occurs not in church services, but in special gatherings or &quot;singings&quot; arranged for the purpose. Singings can be local, regional, statewide, or national. Small singings are often held in homes, with perhaps only a dozen singers. Large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants. The more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day, traditionally called &quot;dinner on the grounds&quot;.

Some of the largest and oldest annual singings are called &quot;conventions&quot;. The oldest Sacred Harp convention was the Southern Musical Convention, organized in Upson County, Georgia in 1845. The two oldest surviving Sacred Harp singing conventions are the Chattahoochee Musical Convention (organized in Coweta County, Georgia in 1852), and the East Texas Sacred Harp Convention (organized as the East Texas Musical Convention in 1855).

=== Sacred Harp music as participatory music ===

Sacred Harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one, not a passive one. Those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other, and not for an audience. This can be seen in several aspects of the tradition.

First, the seating arrangement (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly intended for the singers, not for external listeners. Non-singers are always welcome to attend a singing, but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section, rather than in a designated separate audience location.

The leader, being equidistant from all sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the benefits of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song.

The music itself is also meant to be participatory. Most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top (treble) line, where it can be best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task. For this reason, &quot;bringing out the melody&quot; is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuguing tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part.

==History of Sacred Harp singing==

Marini (2003) traces the earliest roots of Sacred Harp to the &quot;country parish music&quot; of early 18th century England. This form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition, until they ultimately became part of Sacred Harp singing. These traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors, harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifths, and the distinction between the ordinary four-part hymn (&quot;plain tune&quot;), the anthem, and the fuguing tune. Several composers of this school, including Joseph Stephenson and Aaron Williams, are represented in the 1991 Edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. For further information on the English roots of Sacred Harp music, see &quot;West gallery music&quot;.

Around the mid-18th century, the forms and styles of English country parish music were introduced to America, notably in a new tunebook called &quot;Urania&quot;, published 1764 by the singing master James Lyon. This stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition, signaled by the 1770 publication of William Billings&#x27;s &quot;The New England Psalm Singer&quot;, and then by a great number of new compositions by Billings and those who followed in his path. The work of these composers, sometimes called the &quot;First New England School&quot;, forms a major part of the Sacred Harp to this day.

Billings and his followers worked as singing masters, who led singing schools. The purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music. This pedagogical movement flourished, and led ultimately to the invention of shape notes, which originated as a way to make the teaching of singing easier. The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801: &quot;The Easy Instructor&quot; by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little&#x27;s shapes competed with a rival system, created by Andrew Law (1749–1821) in his &quot;The Musical Primer&quot; of 1803. Although this book came out two years later than Smith and Little&#x27;s book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes. In his system, a square indicated &quot;fa&quot;, a circle &quot;sol&quot;, a triangle &quot;la&quot; and a diamond, &quot;mi&quot;. Law used the shaped notes without a musical staff. The Smith and Little shapes ultimately prevailed.

Shape notes became very popular, and during the first part of the nineteenth century, a whole series of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the population spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of folk song for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape note book prior to &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was William Walker&#x27;s &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;, published in 1835 and still in use today.

Even as they flourished and spread, shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack. The critics were from the urban-based &quot;better music&quot; movement, spearheaded by Lowell Mason, which advocated a more &quot;scientific&quot; style of sacred music, more closely based on the harmonic styles of contemporaneous European music. The new style gradually prevailed. Shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the Civil War, and from the rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest in the following decades. However, they retained a haven in the rural South, which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote publications.

=== The arrival of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; ===
Sacred Harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. It was this book, now distributed in several different versions, that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants.

B. F. White (1800–1879) was originally from Union County, South Carolina, but since 1842 had been living in Harris County, Georgia. He prepared &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; in collaboration with a younger man, E. J. King, (–44), who was from Talbot County, Georgia. Together they compiled, transcribed, and composed tunes, and published a book of over 250 songs.

King died soon after the book was published, and White was left to guide its growth. He was responsible for organizing singing schools and conventions at which &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was used as the songbook. During his lifetime, the book became popular and would go through three revisions (1850, 1859, and 1869), all produced by committees consisting of White and several colleagues working under the auspices of the Southern Musical Convention. The first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book. The 1869 revision was more extensive, removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places. From the original 262 pages, the book was expanded by 1869 to 477. This edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades.

===Origin of the modern editions===

Around the turn of the 20th century, Sacred Harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism. The conflict ultimately split the community.

B. F. White had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book; thus the version that Sacred Harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old. During this time, the musical tastes of Sacred Harp&#x27;s traditional adherents, the inhabitants of the rural South, had changed in important ways. Notably, gospel music – syncopated and chromatic, often with piano accompaniment – had become popular, along with a number of church hymns of the &quot;mainstream&quot; variety, such as &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;. Seven-shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four-shape system (see shape note for details). As time passed, Sacred Harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes.

The natural path to take—and the one ultimately taken—would be to assert the archaic character of Sacred Harp as an outright virtue. In this view, Sacred Harp should be treasured as a time-tested musical tradition, standing above current trends of fashion. The difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable, traditionalized version of Sacred Harp would take.

The first move was made by W. M. Cooper, of Dothan, Alabama, a leading Sacred Harp teacher in his own region, but not part of the inner circle of B. F. White&#x27;s old colleagues and descendants. In 1902 Cooper prepared a revision of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; that, while retaining most of the old songs, also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles. Cooper made other changes, too:
* He retitled many old songs. These songs were formerly named by their tune, using arbitrarily chosen place names (&quot;New Britain&quot;, &quot;Northfield&quot;, &quot;Charlestown&quot;). The new names were based on the text; thus &quot;New Britain&quot; became &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, &quot;Northfield&quot; became &quot;How Long, Dear Savior&quot;, and so on. The old system was intended in colonial times to permit mixing and matching of tunes and texts, but was unnecessary in a system where the pairing of tune and text was fixed.
* He transposed some songs into new keys. This is thought to have brought the notation closer to actual performing practice.
* He wrote new alto parts for the many songs that originally just had three vocal lines.

The Cooper revision was a success, being widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The &quot;Cooper book&quot;, as it is now often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909. His son-in-law published the book in 1927, including an appendix compiled by revision committee. The Sacred Harp Book Company was formed in 1949, and subsequent revision has been supervised by editorial committees under its instruction. New editions were issued in 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006 and 2012.

In the original core geographic area of Sacred Harp singing, northern Alabama and Georgia, the singers did not in general take to the Cooper book, as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition. Obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that B. F. White&#x27;s son James L. White, who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition, was a non-traditionalist. His &quot;fifth edition&quot; (1909) won little support among singers, while his &quot;fourth edition with supplement&quot; (1911) enjoyed some success in a few areas. Ultimately, a committee headed by Joseph Stephen James produced an edition entitled &quot;Original Sacred Harp&quot; (1911) that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers.

The James edition was further revised in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers Seaborn and Thomas Denson, both influential singing school teachers. Both died shortly before the project was complete, and the remaining work was overseen by Paine Denson, son of Thomas. This book was entitled &quot;Original Sacred Harp, Denson Revision&quot;, and was itself revised 1960, 1967, and 1971; a more thorough revision and remodeling of this book, overseen by Hugh McGraw, is known simply as the &quot;1991 Edition&quot;, though some singers still call it the &quot;Denson book&quot;.

Even the highly traditionalist James and Denson books followed Cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three-part songs (these alto parts led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Cooper). Some people (see for instance the reference by Buell Cobb given below) believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three-part songs. Wallace McKenzie argues to the contrary, basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs. In any event, there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts, since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing.

It was thus that the traditionalism debate split the Sacred Harp community, and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book. However, there have been no further splits. Both the Denson and the Cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of Sacred Harp they favored, and these forms have now been stable for about a century.

The strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks. The Denson book is forthrightly Biblical in its defense of tradition:

&lt;poem&gt;DEDICATED TO
All lovers of Sacred Harp Music, and to the memory of the illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the Traditional Style of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to &quot;seek the old paths and walk therein&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition:

May God bless everyone as we endeavor to promote and enjoy Sacred Harp music and to continue the rich tradition of those who have gone before us.

To say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs. To the contrary, it is part of the tradition that musically creative Sacred Harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon. The new compositions are prepared in traditional styles, and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material. New songs have been incorporated into editions of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; throughout the 20th century.

===Other Sacred Harp books===

Two other books are currently used by Sacred Harp singers. A few singers in north Georgia employ the &quot;White book&quot;, an expanded version of the 1869 B. F. White edition edited by J. L. White. African-American Sacred Harp singers, although primarily users of the Cooper book, also make use of a supplementary volume, &quot;The Colored Sacred Harp&quot;, produced by Judge Jackson (1883–1958) in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions. In his book &quot;Judge Jackson and The Colored Sacred Harp&quot;, Joe Dan Boyd identified four regions of Sacred Harp singing among African-Americans: eastern Texas (Cooper book), northern Mississippi (Denson book), south Alabama and Florida (Cooper book), and New Jersey (Cooper book). The &quot;Colored Sacred Harp&quot; is limited to the New Jersey and south Alabama–Florida groups. Sacred Harp was &quot;exported&quot; from south Alabama to New Jersey. It appears to have died out among the African-Americans in eastern Texas.

In summary, three revisions of and one companion book to &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; are currently in use in Sacred Harp singing:
* &quot;The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition&quot; (the &quot;Denson book&quot;). Carrollton, Georgia: Sacred Harp Publishing Company.
* &quot;The Sacred Harp, Revised Cooper Edition, 2012&quot;. Samson, Alabama: The Sacred Harp Book Company.
* &quot;The Sacred Harp, J. L. White Fourth Edition, with Supplement&quot; (the &quot;White book&quot;). Atlanta, Georgia: J. L. White. Released 1911; republished 2007.
* &quot;The Colored Sacred Harp&quot;. Ozark, Alabama: Judge Jackson. [3rd revised edition (1992) includes rudiments by H. J. Jackson (son of J. Jackson) and an autobiography of Judge Jackson].

Sacred Harp books generally contain a section on rudiments, describing the basics of music and Sacred Harp singing.

===The spread of Sacred Harp singing in modern times===

In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.

====The U.S. beyond the South====
There are now strong Sacred Harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the United States, and in many rural areas, as well. One of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional Southern home region of Sacred Harp singing was in the Chicago area. The first Illinois convention was held in 1985, with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent Southern traditional singers. The Midwest Convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major American conventions, attracting hundreds of singers from all over the US and abroad. Similarly, the Sacred Harp singing community in western New England has become a prominent one in recent years; the late songleader Larry Gordon has been credited with re-popularizing Sacred Harp singing in northern New England. In March 2008, the 2008 Western Massachusetts Sacred Harp Convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries. Other prominent singing conventions outside the South include, for example, the Keystone Convention in Pennsylvania, the Missouri Convention, and the Minnesota State Convention, which began in 1990.

====Sacred Harp Singing beyond the US====
In more recent times Sacred Harp singing has spread beyond the borders of the United States.

The United Kingdom has had an active Sacred Harp community since the 1990s. The first UK Sacred Harp convention took place in 1996. There are regular singings in London, the Home Counties, the Midlands, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Manchester, Brighton, Newcastle, southwest England, Bristol, as well as in Scotland.

Canada has a decades-long tradition of Sacred Harp singing, particularly in Southern Ontario and the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Singings have been organized weekly in Montreal, Quebec since 2011, as well as a monthly afternoon sing, and the first Montreal all-day sing took place in the spring of 2016. Sacred Harp singing has happened on a monthly basis for years in Toronto.

Australia has had Sacred Harp singing since 2001, and singings are held regularly in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Blackwood. The first Australian All Day Singing was held in Sydney in 2012.

In January 2009, Sacred Harp singing was introduced to Ireland, by Juniper Hill of University College Cork, spreading quickly from a class module into the wider community. In March 2011 U.C.C. hosted the first annual Ireland Sacred Harp Convention, and the Cork community held their first All-Day Singing on 22 October 2011. There are now also growing Sacred Harp communities in Belfast and Dublin.

In the most recent development, Sacred Harp singing has expanded beyond the limits of English-speaking countries to mainland Europe. In 2008 a singing community was established in Poland (which hosted the first Camp Fasola Europe in September 2012). In Germany there are regular weekly or monthly singings in Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne and Munich, most of them with their own annual All-Day singings. Elsewhere in Germany, singers meet irregularly in Frankfurt, Gießen and Nürnberg. Recently groups have started up in Amsterdam, Paris and Clermont-Ferrand, Oslo, Norway, and Uppsala, Sweden. Both the Swedish and Norwegian groups have arranged all-day singings; the 8th Oslo All-Day Singing was held on June 1, 2024 (starting on Friday night May 31, and ending Sunday afternoon June 2).

Regular singings also take place in Israel, and in April 2016, an all-day singing was held in Paris, France.

===Use in popular works===
Sacred Harp singing appears as diegetic music in the films &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2004) and &quot;Lawless&quot; (2012), and as background music in &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (2004).

The 2010 song &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; by M.I.A. includes a sample of &quot;The Last Words of Copernicus&quot; by Sarah Lancaster, recorded at the 1959 United Sacred Harp Convention in Fyffe, Alabama, by Alan Lomax. The album version of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Death to My Hometown&quot; (2012) also samples this recording.

Electronic musician Holly Herndon&#x27;s 2019 track &quot;Frontier&quot; includes a performance of Herndon&#x27;s music by a singing class in Berlin, Germany.

The 2014 animated miniseries &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot; features an original Sacred Harp composition in the second episode, &quot;Hard Times at the Huskin&#x27; Bee&quot;.

==Origins of the music==

The music used in Sacred Harp singing is eclectic. Most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers.

There are a few additional songs in &quot;The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition&quot; that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers. There are some very old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European classical composers (Ignaz Pleyel, Thomas Arne, and Henry Rowley Bishop). The book even includes five hymns by Lowell Mason, long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; has preserved to this day.

The description just given is based on &quot;The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition&quot;, also known as the Denson edition. The widely used &quot;Cooper&quot; edition overlaps considerably (about 60%) in content, but also includes many later songs. A detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by Sacred Harp scholar Gaylon L. Powell.

==Other books with the title &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;==

&quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books, with no fewer than four bearing the title. The first of these was compiled by John Hoyt Hickok and printed in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1832. The second was compiled by Lowell and Timothy Mason and printed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1834, as part of the &quot;better music&quot; movement mentioned above. The publisher released their book as a shape note edition, while they preferred to urbanize their audience by releasing a round note edition.

The third &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; was the one by B. F. White and E. J. King (1844), the origin of today&#x27;s Sacred Harp singing tradition.

Lastly, according to W. J. Reynolds, writing in &quot;Hymns of Our Faith&quot;, there was yet a fourth &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; – &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; published by J. M. D. Cates in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867.

===Comedic parody===

In order to increase accessibility to the Sacred Harp tunes, &quot;Jo Puma – Wild Choir Music&quot; was published by the Machinists Union Press in 2013, combining the unaltered Sacred Harp arrangements with new secular lyrics by Secretary Michael.

<text>The following is a list of California ballot propositions broken down by decade. Propositions can be placed on the ballot either through the exercise of the initiative power by the voters or by a vote of the state legislature. The state initiative power was added to the California constitution in 1911 as part of the ethics reform instituted by Governor Hiram Johnson in the early 1910s.

== By decade ==

* 1880–1889
* 1890–1899
* 1900–1909
* 1910–1919
* 1920–1929
* 1930–1939
* 1940–1949
* 1950–1959
* 1960–1969
* 1970–1979
* 1980–1989
* 1990–1999
* 2000–2009
* 2010–2019
* 2020–2029

==History==

Ballot measures were not numbered prior to the general election of 1914. Until the November 1982 general election, proposition numbers started with &quot;1&quot; for each election. After November 1982, subsequent propositions received sequentially increasing numbers until November 1998 when the count was reset to &quot;1&quot;. Starting with November 1998, the count is reset in 10-year cycles.

Until 1960, citizen-led initiative measures appeared on general election ballots only. From 1960 to 2012, initiative measures appeared on primary, general, and special election ballots. In October 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill (Senate Bill No. 202) which requires all future ballot initiatives to be listed only in general elections (held in November in even-numbered years), rather than during any statewide election. Two propositions had already qualified for the next statewide election (which was the June 2012 presidential primaries) prior to the signing of the law, making the June 2012 primaries the last statewide non-general election in California to have statewide initiatives on the ballot. Propositions originating in the State Legislature can still appear on non-general election ballots, as was the case with Propositions 41 and 42 in June 2014.

<doc id="337755" wikidata="Q1195578" url="?curid=337755" title="Unmanned combat aerial vehicle">
<text>An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), also known as a combat drone, fighter drone or battlefield UAV, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is used for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance and carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), and/or bombs in hardpoints for drone strikes. These drones are usually under real-time human control, with varying levels of autonomy. UCAVs are used for reconnaissance, attacking targets and returning to base; unlike kamikaze drones which are only made to explode on impact, or surveillance drones which are only for gathering intelligence.

Aircraft of this type have no onboard human pilot. As the operator runs the vehicle from a remote terminal, equipment necessary for a human pilot is not needed, resulting in a lower weight and a smaller size than a manned aircraft. Many countries have operational domestic UCAVs, and many more have imported fighter drones or are in the process of developing them.

== History ==


One of the earliest explorations of the concept of the combat drone was by Lee de Forest, an early inventor of radio devices, and U. A. Sanabria, a TV engineer. They presented their idea in an article in a 1940 publication of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;. The modern military drone as known today was the brainchild of John Stuart Foster Jr., a nuclear physicist of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In 1971, Foster was a model airplane hobbyist and had the idea this hobby could be applied to building weapons. He drew up plans and by 1973 DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) built two prototypes called &quot;Prairie&quot; and &quot;Calera&quot;. They were powered by a modified lawn-mower engine and could stay aloft for two hours while carrying a load.

In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used unarmed U.S. Ryan Firebee target drones to spur Egypt into firing its entire arsenal of anti-aircraft missiles. This mission was accomplished with no injuries to Israeli pilots, who soon exploited the depleted Egyptian defences. In the late 1970s and 80s, Israel developed the Scout and the Pioneer, which represented a shift toward the lighter, glider-type model of UAV in use today. Israel pioneered the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for real-time surveillance, electronic warfare, and decoys. The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses in Operation Mole Cricket 19 at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.

In the late 1980s, Iran deployed a drone armed with six RPG-7 rounds in the Iran–Iraq War.

Impressed by Israel&#x27;s success, the US quickly acquired a number of UAVs, and its Hunter and Pioneer systems are direct derivatives of Israeli models. The first &#x27;UAV war&#x27; was the first Persian Gulf War: according to a May 1991 Department of the Navy report: &quot;At least one UAV was airborne at all times during Desert Storm.&quot; After the Persian Gulf War successfully demonstrated its utility, global militaries invested widely in the domestic development of combat UAVs. The first &quot;kill&quot; by an American UAV was on October 7, 2001, in Kandahar.

In recent years, the U.S. has increased its use of drone strikes against targets in Pakistan and elsewhere as part of the War on Terror. In January 2014, it was estimated that 2,400 people had died from U.S. drone strikes in five years. In June 2015, the total death toll of U.S. drone strikes was estimated to exceed 6,000.

In 2020, Turkey became the first country to use UCAVs in a large, coordinated attack on a conventional battlefield when they attacked forces in Syria. They were used to attack enemy positions, to provide cover for ground forces and to scout for artillery. Drones were used extensively in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Azerbaijan&#x27;s use of cheaper Turkish TB2 drones was seen as crucial to their victory against the Armenian forces. Drones were also used extensively during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Usage of drones offers a cost advantage: &quot;People are taking small drones, like the ones you can buy at JB Hi-Fi for $2000, putting a grenade on them and flying them over a crowd or a tank and releasing the grenade. You can basically build a $3000 machine to destroy a $5 million piece of equipment that your enemy has.&quot;

== Current ==

Below are a list of some current dedicated armed UAV&#x27;s:

Some reconnaissance drones that have armed capability include the CASC CH-92, IAI Eitan and the Ababil-3, Ababil-5, Hamaseh. Some commercial drones such as DJI Mavic and Phantom have been modified to carry light explosives for combat missions in recent wars.

=== Future ===

Below is a table of some technology demonstrators and projects in development:


===Israel===
==== Elbit Hermes 450 ====
The Israeli Air Force, which operates a squadron of Hermes 450s out of Palmachim Airbase south of Tel Aviv, has adapted the Hermes 450 for use as an assault UAV, reportedly equipping it with two Hellfire missiles or, according to various sources, two Rafael-made missiles. According to Israeli, Palestinian, Lebanese, and independent reports, the Israeli assault UAV has been used in the Gaza Strip and was used intensively in the Second Lebanon War. Israel has not denied this capability, but to date, its policy has been to not officially confirm it either.

===Turkey===
====TAI Aksungur====

TAI Aksungur is a built by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) for the Turkish Armed Forces. Using existing technology from the TAI Anka series of drones, it is the manufacturer&#x27;s largest drone, with payload capacity for mission-specific equipment. It is intended to be used for long-term surveillance, signals intelligence, maritime patrol missions, or as an UCAV. The first unit was delivered to the Turkish Naval Forces on 20 October 2021.

==== Bayraktar Kizilelma ====

Bayraktar Kızılelma is a proposed jet-powered, single-engine, low-observable, supersonic, carrier-capable unmanned combat aircraft in development by Baykar, famous for its Bayraktar TB2. On 12 March 2022, Selçuk Bayraktar, CTO of Baykar announced that the first prototype of the Bayraktar Kızılelma has entered the production line.

==== TAI Anka-3 ====
TAI Anka 3 is the code-name for the new single engine UCAV being developed by TAI. It will have a flying wing form, and will feature low-observable stealth technology. The role of the aircraft will be suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), penetration and bomber.

===United Kingdom===
==== BAE Systems Taranis ====
Taranis is a British demonstrator program for unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) technology. It is part of the UK&#x27;s Strategic Unmanned Air Vehicle (Experimental) (SUAV[E]) program. BAE describes Taranis&#x27;s role in this context as following: &quot;This £124m, four 
-year programme is part of the UK Government&#x27;s Strategic Unmanned Air Vehicle Experiment (SUAVE) and will result in a UCAV demonstrator with fully integrated autonomous systems and low observable features.&quot;

The Taranis demonstrator will have an MTOW (Maximum Takeoff Weight) of about 8000 kilograms and be of comparable size to the BAE Hawk – making it one of the world&#x27;s largest UAVs. It will be stealthy, fast, and able to deploy a range of munitions over a number of targets, as well as being capable of defending itself against manned and other unmanned enemy aircraft. The first steel was cut in September 2007 and ground testing started in early 2009. The first flight of the Taranis took place in August 2013 in Woomera, Australia. The demonstrator will have two internal weapons bays. With the inclusion of &quot;full autonomy&quot; the intention is thus for this platform to be able to &quot;think for itself&quot; for a large part of the mission.

===United States===
==== J-UCAS ====
*Boeing X-45 UCAV (TD)
*Northrop-Grumman X-47 Pegasus

Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems, or J-UCAS, was the name for the joint U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force unmanned combat air vehicle procurement project. J-UCAS was managed by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, the J-UCAS program was terminated. The program would have used stealth technologies and allowed UCAVs to be armed with precision-guided weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or precision miniature munitions, such as the Small-Diameter Bomb, which are used to suppress enemy air defenses. Controllers could have used real-time data sources, including satellites, to plan for and respond to changes on and around the battlefield.

The program was later revitalized into UCAS-D, a United States Navy program designed to develop a carrier-based unmanned aircraft.

==== N-UCAS ====
UCAS-D and Northrop Grumman X-47B are the U.S. Navy-only successors to the J-UCAS, which was canceled in 2006. Boeing is also working on the X-45N in this sector.

In a New Year 2011 editorial titled &quot;China&#x27;s Naval Ambitions&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial board argued that &quot;[t]he Pentagon must accelerate efforts to make American naval forces in Asia less vulnerable to Chinese missile threats by giving them the means to project their deterrent power from further offshore. Cutting back purchases of the Navy&#x27;s DDG-1000 destroyer (with its deficient missile defense system) was a first step. A bigger one would be to reduce the Navy&#x27;s reliance on short-range manned strike aircraft like the F-18 and the F-35, in favor of the carrier-launched N-UCAS ...&quot;

On 6 January 2011, the DOD announced that this would be one area of additional investment in the 2012 budget request.

==== USAF Hunter-Killer ====
*Scaled Composites Model 395
*Scaled Composites Model 396
*General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (originally the Predator B)
*Aurora Flight Sciences/Israel Aircraft Industries Eagle/Heron 2
*Unnamed Lockheed Martin entry

The United States Air Force has shifted its UCAV program from medium-range tactical strike aircraft to long-range strategic bombers. The technology of the Long Range Strike program is based on the Lockheed Martin Polecat demonstrator.

=== Multinational ===
* EADS Surveyor: The EADS &quot;Surveyor&quot; is still in preliminary investigation phase. It will be a fixed-wing, jet-powered UAV and is being positioned as a replacement for the CL-289. EADS is currently working on a demonstrator, the &quot;Carapas&quot;, modified from an Italian Mirach 100 drone. The production Surveyor would be a stealthy machine with a top speed of 850 km/h (530 mph), an endurance of up to three hours, and capable of carrying a sophisticated sensor payload, including SIGINT gear. It would also be able to carry external loads, such as air-dropped sensors or light munitions.

==Non-state actors==
In the mid-2010s, the Islamic State terrorist group began attaching explosives to commercially-available quadcopters such as the Chinese-made DJI Phantom to bomb military targets in Iraq and Syria. During the 2016–17 battle of Mosul, the Islamic State reportedly used drones as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms, using improvised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives. An Islamic State drone facility was notably targeted by Royal Air Force strike aircraft during the battle.

Militant groups during the Syrian civil war have also reportedly used UAVs in attacks, one example being a swarm of drones armed with bombs attacking Russian bases in western Syria in early January 2018.

Starting in the 2020s, Mexican drug cartels began dropping reportedly hundreds of drone-carried bombs targeting both security forces and enemy gangs during turf wars.

==Counter drone tactics==

There has been widespread use of drones in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Ukrainian soldiers use GPS signals to guide a drone to find Russian artillery and to guide Ukrainian artillery. Jamming these drone GPS signals cause drones to operate less effectively, as the operators of drones have to rely on pre-programmed routes through areas of jamming until communications can be restored. Other systems supplied by the West rely on automation. Systems like the AeroVironment Switchblade can find targets autonomously, requiring human permission only to engage found targets. In October 2022 a video appeared on the web showing two drones colliding and one being rendered unflyable as a result. It was claimed that the filming drone was Ukrainian and the one destroyed was Russian. If this is the case it would be the first recorded case of drone on drone combat.

On 27 December 2022 North Korea sent five drones over its border with South Korea. One reaching Seoul, all five returned to the North, despite a five-hour chase involving fighter jets and attack helicopters with some 100 rounds being fired. A South Korean KAI KT-1 Woongbi crashed although both crew survived. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (South Korea) released a statement in which it said that while it can stop attack drones, its ability to stop smaller spy drones is &quot;limited&quot;. A senior official, Kang Shin-chul, said: &quot;Our military&#x27;s lack of preparedness has caused a lot of concern to the people…actively employ detection devices to spot the enemy&#x27;s drone from an early stage and aggressively deploy strike assets&quot;. The South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has indicated that South Korea will invest in stealthy drones that could penetrate North Korea, with the creation of a new military unit.

The South Korean Defence Ministry announced a new series of anti-drone measures, planning to spend some 560 billion won over the next five years. The money will go towards four new initiatives. One is an airborne laser that will be used to destroy larger drones whilst a jammer would be used on smaller drones. A new counter drone unit, made up of two squadrons, would also be created. The laser is already in the test phase and is expected to become operational in 2027. The jamming system has been described as &quot;soft kill&quot;.

==Error in target selection==
There are only estimates of the magnitude of the errors in target selection. However, they do occur and some of them become known.

One fatal &quot;error&quot; happened in December 2023, when the Nigerian army accidentally hit a village in northwestern Nigeria killing 85 civilians celebrating a Muslim festival. The army said they thought the people were rebels.

== Ethics and laws ==
===Civilian casualties===
====Israel====
In March 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported allegations that Israeli UAVs armed with missiles killed 48 Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, including two small children in a field and a group of women and girls in an otherwise empty street. In June, Human Rights Watch investigated six UAV attacks that were reported to have resulted in civilian casualties and alleged that Israeli forces either failed to take all feasible precautions to verify that the targets were combatants or failed to distinguish between combatants and civilians.

==== United States ====
Collateral damage of civilians still takes place with drone combat, although some (like John O. Brennan) have argued that it greatly reduces the likelihood. Although drones enable advanced tactical surveillance and up-to-the-minute data, flaws can become apparent. The U.S. drone program in Pakistan has killed several dozen civilians accidentally. An example is the operation in February 2010 near Khod, in Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan. Over ten civilians in a three-vehicle convoy travelling from Daykundi Province were accidentally killed after a drone crew misidentified the civilians as hostile threats. A force of Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters, who were attempting to protect ground troops fighting several kilometers away, fired AGM-114 Hellfire missiles at the vehicles.

In 2009, the Brookings Institution reported that in the US-led drone attacks in Pakistan, ten civilians died for every militant killed. A former ambassador of Pakistan said that American UAV attacks were turning Pakistani opinion against the United States. The website PakistanBodyCount.Org reported 1,065 civilian deaths between 2004 and 2010. According to a 2010 analysis by the New America Foundation 114 UAV-based missile strikes in northwest Pakistan from 2004 killed between 830 and 1,210 individuals, around 550 to 850 of whom were militants. In October 2013, the Pakistani government revealed that since 2008 317 drone strikes had killed 2,160 Islamic militants and 67 civilians – far less than previous government and independent organization calculations.

In July 2013, former Pentagon lawyer Jeh Johnson said, on a panel at the Aspen Institute&#x27;s Security Forum, that he felt an emotional reaction upon reading Nasser al-Awlaki&#x27;s account of how his 16-year-old grandson was killed by a U.S. drone.

In December 2013, a U.S. drone strike in Radda, capital of Yemen&#x27;s Bayda province, killed members of a wedding party. The following February, Human Rights Watch published a 28-page report reviewing the strike and its legality, among other things. Titled &quot;A Wedding That Became A Funeral&quot;, the report concludes that some (but not necessarily all) of the casualties were civilians, not the intended regional Al-Qaeda targets. The organization demanded US and Yemeni investigations into the attack. In its research, HRW &quot;found no evidence that the individuals taking part in the wedding procession posed an imminent threat to life. In the absence of an armed conflict, killing them would be a violation of international human rights law.&quot;

=== Political effects ===
As a new weapon, drones are having unforeseen political effects. Some scholars have argued that the extensive use of drones will undermine the popular legitimacy of local governments, which are blamed for permitting the strikes.

On August 6, 2020, U.S. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Chris Coons (D-DE), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a bill to ban sales, transfers, and exports of large armed drones to countries outside of NATO amid concerns that civilians were killed with American-made weapons used by Saudi Arabia and the UAE during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Congress had previously passed a similar measure with bipartisan support, but failed to overcome President Donald Trump&#x27;s veto.

===Psychological effects===

Controllers can also experience psychological stress from the combat they are involved in. A few may even experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There are some reports of drone pilots struggling with post traumatic stress disorder after they have killed civilians, especially children. Unlike bomber pilots, moreover, drone operators linger long after the explosives strike and see its effects on human bodies in stark detail. The intense training that US drone operators undergo &quot;works to dehumanise the &#x27;enemy&#x27; people below whilst glorifying and celebrating the killing process.&quot;

Professor Shannon E. French, the director of the Center for Ethics and Excellence at Case Western Reserve University and a former professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, wonders if the PTSD may be rooted in a suspicion that something else was at stake. According to Professor French, the author of the 2003 book &quot;The Code of the Warrior&quot;:
If [I&#x27;m] in the field risking and taking a life, there&#x27;s a sense that I&#x27;m putting skin in the game ... I&#x27;m taking a risk so it feels more honorable. Someone who kills at a distance—it can make them doubt. Am I truly honorable?The Missile Technology Control Regime applies to UCAVs.

On 28 October 2009, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, presented a report to the Third Committee (social, humanitarian and cultural) of the General Assembly arguing that the use of unmanned combat air vehicles for targeted killings should be regarded as a breach of international law unless the United States can demonstrate appropriate precautions and accountability mechanisms are in place.

In June 2015 forty-five former US military personnel issued a joint appeal to pilots of aerial drones operating in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and elsewhere urging them to refuse to fly and indicated that their missions &quot;profoundly violate domestic and international laws.&quot; They noted that these drone attacks also undermine principles of human rights.

Some leaders worry about the effect drone warfare will have on soldiers&#x27; psychology. Keith Shurtleff, an army chaplain at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, worries &quot;that as war becomes safer and easier, as soldiers are removed from the horrors of war and see the enemy not as humans but as blips on a screen, there is very real danger of losing the deterrent that such horrors provide&quot;. Similar worries surfaced when &quot;smart&quot; bombs began to be used extensively in the First Gulf War.

Stanford&#x27;s ‘Living Under Drones’ researchers, meanwhile, have shown that civilians in Pakistan and Afghanistan are reluctant to help those hit by the first strikes because rescuers themselves have often been killed by follow-on drone strikes. Injured relatives in the rubble of the first strike have been known to tell their relatives not to help rescue them because of the frequency of these so-called ‘double-tap’ strikes. People also avoid gathering in groups in visible places. Many children are permanently kept indoors and often no longer attend school.

Writer Mark Bowden has disputed this viewpoint saying in his The Atlantic article, &quot;But flying a drone, [the pilot] sees the carnage close-up, in real time—the blood and severed body parts, the arrival of emergency responders, the anguish of friends and family. Often he’s been watching the people he kills for a long time before pulling the trigger. Drone pilots become familiar with their victims. They see them in the ordinary rhythms of their lives—with their wives and friends, with their children. War by remote control turns out to be intimate and disturbing. Pilots are sometimes shaken.&quot;

This assessment is corroborated by a sensor operator&#x27;s account: 

Back in the United States, a combination of &quot;lower-class&quot; status in the military, overwork, and psychological trauma may be taking a mental toll on drone pilots. These psychological, cultural and career issues appear to have led to a shortfall in USAF drone operators, which is seen as a &quot;dead end job&quot;.

=== Stand-off attacks ===
The &quot;unmanned&quot; aspect of armed UAVs has raised moral concerns about their use in combat and law enforcement contexts. Attacking humans with remote-controlled machines is even more abstract than the use of other &quot;stand-off&quot; weaponry, such as missiles, artillery and aerial bombardment, possibly depersonalizing the decision to attack. By contrast, UAVs and other stand-off systems reduce casualties among the attackers.

=== Autonomous attacks ===

The picture is further complicated if the UAV can initiate an attack autonomously, without direct human involvement. Such UAVs could possibly react more quickly and without bias, but would lack human sensibility. Heather Roff replies that lethal autonomous robots (LARs) may not be appropriate for complex conflicts and targeted populations would likely react angrily against them. Will McCants argues that the public would be more outraged by machine failures than human error, making LARs politically implausible. According to Mark Gubrud, claims that drones can be hacked are overblown and misleading and moreover, drones are &quot;more&quot; likely to be hacked if they&#x27;re autonomous, because otherwise the human operator would take control: &quot;Giving weapon systems autonomous capabilities is a good way to lose control of them, either due to a programming error, unanticipated circumstances, malfunction, or hack and then not be able to regain control short of blowing them up, hopefully before they&#x27;ve blown up too many other things and people.&quot; Others have argued that the technological possibility of autonomy should not obscure the continuing moral responsibilities humans have at every stage. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the attribution of moral responsibility can be apportioned appropriately under existing international humanitarian law, which is based on four principles: military necessity, distinction between military and civilian objects, prohibition of unnecessary suffering, and proportionality.

== Public opinion ==

In 2013, a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll asked registered voters whether they &quot;approve or disapprove of the U.S. military using drones to carry out attacks abroad on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.?&quot; The results showed that three in every four voters (75%) approved of the U.S. military using drones to carry out attacks, while (13%) disapproved. A poll conducted by the Huffington Post in 2013 also showed a majority supporting targeted killings using drones, though by a smaller margin. A 2015 poll showed Republicans and men are more likely to support U.S. drone strikes, while Democrats, independents, women, young people, and minorities are less supportive.

Outside America, there is widespread opposition to US drone killings. A July 2014 report found a majority or plurality of respondents in 39 of 44 countries surveyed opposed U.S. drone strikes in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The U.S., Kenya, and Israel were the only countries where at least half the population supported drone strikes. Venezuela was found to be the most anti-drone country, where 92% of respondents disagreed with U.S. drone strikes, followed closely by Jordan, where 90% disagreed; Israel was shown as the most pro-drone, with 65% in favor of U.S. drone strikes and 27% opposed.

<text>A Gospel Book, Evangelion, or Book of the Gospels (Greek: , ) is a codex or bound volume containing one or more of the four Gospels of the Christian New Testament – normally all four – centering on the life of Jesus of Nazareth and the roots of the Christian faith. The term is also used for a liturgical book, also called the Evangeliary, from which are read the portions of the Gospels used in the Mass and other services, arranged according to the order of the liturgical calendar.

Liturgical use in churches of a distinct Gospel book remains normal, often compulsory, in Eastern Christianity, and very common in Roman Catholicism and some parts of Anglicanism and Lutheranism.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the production of copies of the Bible in its entirety was rare because of the huge expense of the parchment required. Individual books or collections of books were produced for specific purposes. From the 4th century Gospel Books were produced for liturgical use, as well as private study and as &quot;display books&quot; for ceremonial and ornamental purposes. The Codex Washingtonianus (Freer gospels) is an early example of a book containing only the four gospels, in Greek, written in the 4th or 5th century. By the 7th century particular gospel texts were allocated to days in the liturgical calendar; previously gospel readings had often worked through the books in sequence. Many of these volumes were elaborate; the Gospel Book was the most common form of heavily illuminated manuscript until about the 11th century, when the Romanesque Bible and Psalter largely superseded it in the West. In the East they remained a significant subject for illumination until the arrival of printing. The Evangelist portrait was a particular feature of their decoration. Most of the masterpieces of both Insular and Ottonian illumination are Gospel Books.

But most Gospel Books were never illuminated at all, or only with decorated initials and other touches. They often contained, in addition to the text of the Gospels themselves, supporting texts including Canon Tables, summaries, glossaries, and other explanatory material. Latin books often include the Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus where Jerome set out to the Pope the reasoning behind his new Vulgate translation and arrangement of the texts, and many Greek ones the Epistula ad Carpianum (Letter to Carpian) of Eusebius of Caesarea explaining the Eusebian Canons he had devised.

Luxuriously illuminated gospel books were mainly a feature of the Early Middle Ages, as the evangeliary or a general lectionary gradually became more common for liturgical use, and other texts became most favoured for elaborate decoration.

==Western use==
===Roman Catholicism===

In current Roman Catholic usage, the Book of the Gospels or Evangeliary contains the full text of the passages from all four gospels that the deacon or priest is to read or chant at Mass in the course of the liturgical year. However, use of the Book of the Gospels is not mandatory, and the gospel readings are also included in the standard Lectionary.

The Book of the Gospels, if used, is brought to the altar in the entrance procession, while the Lectionary may not be. When carried in procession, the Book of the Gospels is held slightly elevated, though not over the head. It is particularly proper for the deacon to carry the Book of the Gospels in procession, as the reading of the gospel is his particular province. When there is no deacon, the Book may be carried by a lector. Upon reaching the altar, the deacon or lector bows in veneration of the altar, then places the Book upon the altar, where it remains until the Alleluia.

During the singing of the Alleluia, the deacon (who before proclaiming the gospel receives the presiding priest&#x27;s blessing), or in his absence, a priest, removes the Book from the altar and processes with it to the ambo. If incense is used, the Book of the Gospels is censed by the deacon before the reading or chanting. An altar server or acolyte will swing the censer slowly during the reading or chanting. The Book of the Gospels remains on the ambo until the Mass concludes, unless it is taken to a bishop to be kissed, after which it may be placed on the credence table or another appropriate and dignified place.

===Lutheranism===
In the Lutheran Churches, the Book of the Gospels is &quot;carried in procession&quot;. 

===Anglicanism===

In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America the practice of using a Gospel Book was recovered with the 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which suggests that the lessons and gospel &quot;be read from a book or books of appropriate size and dignity&quot;.

<text>The Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 76,000 acre (307.56 km2) national wildlife refuge located in south-central Arkansas in Ashley, Bradley, and Union counties. Felsenthal NWR is one of three refuges forming an administrative complex, which also includes Pond Creek NWR to the northwest and Overflow NWR to the east.

== Habitat and wildlife ==
Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a wetlands complex located on the confluence of the Saline and Ouachita Rivers. The refuge is dissected by an intricate system of rivers, creeks, sloughs, and lakes throughout a bottomland hardwood forest that rises to an upland forest community. The Felsenthal basin holds approximately 15,000 acres of water that can double to over 36,000 acres during periods of heavy flooding.

Felsenthal NWR&#x27;s habitat diversity supports a large amount of biodiversity. Over 1,150 species of plants and animals have been documented on the refuge. Felsenthal NWR is the only national wildlife refuge in Arkansas with a population of the federally-protected red-cockaded woodpecker. The refuge has been recognized as part of a globally Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society.

== History ==
Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established in 1975 as mitigation for the creation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Ouachita-Black Rivers Navigation Project and Felsenthal Lock and Dam. The refuge also protects over 200 Native American archaeological sites, primarily of Caddo origin. These sites include the remains of seasonal fishing camps, ceremonial plazas, temple mounds, and large villages. Archaeological sites are closed to the public to protect them from degradation.

<text>Philip Francis Little (1824 – October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844.

He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law, the first Roman Catholic to practise law in St. John&#x27;s. His strong views on responsible government, his connections in St. John&#x27;s Catholic society, and his ability to unite disparate elements of the Liberal Party propelled him to a leadership role in politics.

He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland&#x27;s first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony&#x27;s Attorney-General. D.W. Prowse would record that it was, &quot;as near to perfection as possible&quot;. With the period of 1855-1857 described as being &quot;the sunshine of prosperity.&quot; Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent.

He resigned in 1858 saying &quot;I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me&quot;. He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife.

He was appointed as assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. 

==Personal life==

He married Mary Jane Holdright, from a wealthy Anglo-Irish family, in 1864. Philip Little retired to Ireland in 1868 and worked for the Home Rule movement there. He and his wife had 13 children, the youngest of whom, Patrick, became a politician. Philip Francis Little died at age 73 in 1897 in Monkstown, County Dublin.

<text>Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the performance of nuclear weapons and the effects of their explosion. Nuclear testing is a sensitive political issue. Governments have often performed tests to signal strength. Because of their destruction and fallout, testing has seen opposition by civilians as well as governments, with international bans having been agreed on. Thousands of tests have been performed, with most in the second half of the 20th century.

The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first thermonuclear weapon technology test of an engineered device, codenamed Ivy Mike, was tested at the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the Tsar Bomba of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.

With the advent of nuclear technology and its increasingly global fallout an anti-nuclear movement formed and in 1963, three (UK, US, Soviet Union) of the then four nuclear states and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China continued until 1980. Neither has signed the treaty.

Underground tests conducted by the Soviet Union continued until 1990, the United Kingdom until 1991, the United States until 1992, and both China and France until 1996. In signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, these countries pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing; the treaty has not yet entered into force because of its failure to be ratified by eight countries. Non-signatories India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998. North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, January 2016, September 2016 and 2017. The most recent confirmed nuclear test in September 2017 in North Korea.

==Types==

Nuclear weapons tests have historically been divided into four categories reflecting the medium or location of the test.

*Atmospheric testing involves explosions that take place in the atmosphere. Generally, these have occurred as devices detonated on towers, balloons, barges, or islands, or dropped from airplanes, and also those only buried far enough to intentionally create a surface-breaking crater. The United States, the Soviet Union, and China have all conducted tests involving explosions of missile-launched bombs (See List of nuclear weapons tests#Tests of live warheads on rockets). Nuclear explosions close enough to the ground to draw dirt and debris into their mushroom cloud can generate large amounts of nuclear fallout due to irradiation of the debris (particularly with neutron radiation) as well as radioactive contamination of otherwise non-radioactive material. This definition of atmospheric is used in the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned this class of testing along with exoatmospheric and underwater.
*Underground testing is conducted under the surface of the earth, at varying depths. Underground nuclear testing made up the majority of nuclear tests by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War; other forms of nuclear testing were banned by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. True underground tests are intended to be fully contained and emit a negligible amount of fallout. Unfortunately these nuclear tests do occasionally &quot;vent&quot; to the surface, producing from nearly none to considerable amounts of radioactive debris as a consequence. Underground testing, almost by definition, causes seismic activity of a magnitude that depends on the yield of the nuclear device and the composition of the medium in which it is detonated, and generally creates a subsidence crater. In 1976, the United States and the USSR agreed to limit the maximum yield of underground tests to 150 kt with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.Underground testing also falls into two physical categories: tunnel tests in generally horizontal tunnel &quot;drifts&quot;, and shaft tests in vertically drilled holes.
*Exoatmospheric testing is conducted above the atmosphere. The test devices are lifted on rockets. These high-altitude nuclear explosions can generate a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) when they occur in the ionosphere, and charged particles resulting from the blast can cross hemispheres following geomagnetic lines of force to create an auroral display.
*Underwater testing involves nuclear devices being detonated underwater, usually moored to a ship or a barge (which is subsequently destroyed by the explosion). Tests of this nature have usually been conducted to evaluate the effects of nuclear weapons against naval vessels (such as in Operation Crossroads), or to evaluate potential sea-based nuclear weapons (such as nuclear torpedoes or depth charges). Underwater tests close to the surface can disperse large amounts of radioactive particles in water and steam, contaminating nearby ships or structures, though they generally do not create fallout other than very locally to the explosion.

===Salvo tests===
Another way to classify nuclear tests is by the number of explosions that constitute the test. The treaty definition of a salvo test is:

In conformity with treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, a salvo is defined, for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes, as two or more separate explosions where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points, and the total length does not exceed 40 kilometers. For nuclear weapon tests, a salvo is defined as two or more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted within a total period of time of 0.1 seconds.

The USSR has exploded up to eight devices in a single salvo test; Pakistan&#x27;s second and last official test exploded four different devices. Almost all lists in the literature are lists of tests; in the lists in Wikipedia (for example, &quot;Operation Cresset&quot; has separate items for &quot;Cremino&quot; and &quot;Caerphilly&quot;, which together constitute a single test), the lists are of explosions.

==Purpose==
Separately from these designations, nuclear tests are also often categorized by the purpose of the test itself.

* Weapons-related tests are designed to garner information about how (and if) the weapons themselves work. Some serve to develop and validate a specific weapon type. Others test experimental concepts or are physics experiments meant to gain fundamental knowledge of the processes and materials involved in nuclear detonations.
* Weapons effects tests are designed to gain information about the effects of the weapons on structures, equipment, organisms, and the environment. They are mainly used to assess and improve survivability to nuclear explosions in civilian and military contexts, tailor weapons to their targets, and develop the tactics of nuclear warfare.
* Safety experiments are designed to study the behavior of weapons in simulated accident scenarios. In particular, they are used to verify that a (significant) nuclear detonation cannot happen by accident. They include one-point safety tests and simulations of storage and transportation accidents.
* Nuclear test detection experiments are designed to improve the capabilities to detect, locate, and identify nuclear detonations, in particular, to monitor compliance with test-ban treaties. In the United States these tests are associated with Operation Vela Uniform before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty stopped all nuclear testing among signatories.
* Peaceful nuclear explosions were conducted to investigate non-military applications of nuclear explosives. In the United States, these were performed under the umbrella name of Operation Plowshare.

Aside from these technical considerations, tests have been conducted for political and training purposes, and can often serve multiple purposes.

==Alternatives to full-scale testing==
Computer simulation is used extensively to provide as much information as possible without physical testing. Mathematical models for such simulation model scenarios not only of performance but also of shelf life and maintenance. A theme has generally been that even though simulations cannot fully replace physical testing, they can reduce the amount of it that is necessary.

Hydronuclear tests study nuclear materials under the conditions of explosive shock compression. They can create subcritical conditions, or supercritical conditions with yields ranging from negligible all the way up to a substantial fraction of full weapon yield.

Critical mass experiments determine the quantity of fissile material required for criticality with a variety of fissile material compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be subcritical or supercritical, in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test has resulted in several criticality accidents.

Subcritical (or cold) tests are any type of tests involving nuclear materials and possibly high explosives (like those mentioned above) that purposely result in no yield. The name refers to the lack of creation of a critical mass of fissile material. They are the only type of tests allowed under the interpretation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty tacitly agreed to by the major atomic powers. Subcritical tests continue to be performed by the United States, Russia, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, at least.

Subcritical tests executed by the United States include:

==History==


The first atomic weapons test was conducted near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, during the Manhattan Project, and given the codename &quot;Trinity&quot;. The test was originally to confirm that the implosion-type nuclear weapon design was feasible, and to give an idea of what the actual size and effects of a nuclear explosion would be before they were used in combat against Japan. The test gave a good approximation of many of the explosion&#x27;s effects, but did not give an appreciable understanding of nuclear fallout, which was not well understood by the project scientists until well after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The United States conducted six atomic tests before the Soviet Union developed their first atomic bomb (RDS-1) and tested it on August 29, 1949. Neither country had very many atomic weapons to spare at first, and so testing was relatively infrequent (when the US used two weapons for &quot;Operation Crossroads&quot; in 1946, they were detonating over 20% of their current arsenal). By the 1950s the United States had established a dedicated test site on its own territory (Nevada Test Site) and was also using a site in the Marshall Islands (Pacific Proving Grounds) for extensive atomic and nuclear testing.

The early tests were used primarily to discern the military effects of atomic weapons (&quot;Crossroads&quot; had involved the effect of atomic weapons on a navy, and how they functioned underwater) and to test new weapon designs. During the 1950s, these included new hydrogen bomb designs, which were tested in the Pacific, and also new and improved fission weapon designs. The Soviet Union also began testing on a limited scale, primarily in Kazakhstan. During the later phases of the Cold War, both countries developed accelerated testing programs, testing many hundreds of bombs over the last half of the 20th century.

Atomic and nuclear tests can involve many hazards. Some of these were illustrated in the US Castle Bravo test in 1954. The weapon design tested was a new form of hydrogen bomb, and the scientists underestimated how vigorously some of the weapon materials would react. As a result, the explosion—with a yield of 15 Mt—was over twice what was predicted. Aside from this problem, the weapon also generated a large amount of radioactive nuclear fallout, more than had been anticipated, and a change in the weather pattern caused the fallout to spread in a direction not cleared in advance. The fallout plume spread high levels of radiation for over , contaminating populated islands in nearby atoll formations. Though they were soon evacuated, many of the islands&#x27; inhabitants suffered from radiation burns and later from other effects such as increased cancer rate and birth defects, as did the crew of the Japanese fishing boat &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;. One crewman died from radiation sickness after returning to port, and it was feared that the radioactive fish they had been carrying had made it into the Japanese food supply.

Castle Bravo was the worst US nuclear accident, but many of its component problems—unpredictably large yields, changing weather patterns, unexpected fallout contamination of populations and the food supply—occurred during other atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by other countries as well. Concerns over worldwide fallout rates eventually led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which limited signatories to underground testing. Not all countries stopped atmospheric testing, but because the United States and the Soviet Union were responsible for roughly 86% of all nuclear tests, their compliance cut the overall level substantially. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China until 1980.

A tacit moratorium on testing was in effect from 1958 to 1961 and ended with a series of Soviet tests in late 1961, including the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever tested. The United States responded in 1962 with Operation Dominic, involving dozens of tests, including the explosion of a missile launched from a submarine.

Almost all new nuclear powers have announced their possession of nuclear weapons with a nuclear test. The only acknowledged nuclear power that claims never to have conducted a test was South Africa (although see Vela incident), which has since dismantled all of its weapons. Israel is widely thought to possess a sizable nuclear arsenal, though it has never tested, unless they were involved in Vela. Experts disagree on whether states can have reliable nuclear arsenals—especially ones using advanced warhead designs, such as hydrogen bombs and miniaturized weapons—without testing, though all agree that it is very unlikely to develop significant nuclear innovations without testing. One other approach is to use supercomputers to conduct &quot;virtual&quot; testing, but codes need to be validated against test data.

There have been many attempts to limit the number and size of nuclear tests; the most far-reaching is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1996, which has not, , been ratified by eight of the &quot;Annex 2 countries&quot; required for it to take effect, including the United States. Nuclear testing has since become a controversial issue in the United States, with a number of politicians saying that future testing might be necessary to maintain the aging warheads from the Cold War. Because nuclear testing is seen as furthering nuclear arms development, many are opposed to future testing as an acceleration of the arms race.

In total nuclear test megatonnage, from 1945 to 1992, 520 atmospheric nuclear explosions (including eight underwater) were conducted with a total yield of 545 megatons, with a peak occurring in 1961–1962, when 340 megatons were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union, while the estimated number of underground nuclear tests conducted in the period from 1957 to 1992 was 1,352 explosions with a total yield of 90 Mt.

==Yield==
The yields of atomic bombs and thermonuclear are typically measured in different amounts. Thermonuclear bombs can be hundreds or thousands of times stronger than their atomic counterparts. Due to this, thermonuclear bombs&#x27; yields are usually expressed in megatons which is about the equivalent of 1,000,000 tons of TNT. In contrast, atomic bombs&#x27; yields are typically measured in kilotons, or about 1,000 tons of TNT. 

In US context, it was decided during the Manhattan Project that yield measured in tons of TNT equivalent could be imprecise. This comes from the range of experimental values of the energy content of TNT, ranging from . There is also the issue of which ton to use, as short tons, long tons, and metric tonnes all have different values. It was therefore decided that one kiloton would be equivalent to .

==Nuclear testing by country==


The nuclear powers have conducted more than 2,000 nuclear test explosions (numbers are approximate, as some test results have been disputed):

* United States: 1,054 tests by official count (involving at least 1,149 devices). 219 were atmospheric tests as defined by the CTBT. These tests include 904 at the Nevada Test Site, 106 at the Pacific Proving Grounds and other locations in the Pacific, 3 in the South Atlantic Ocean, and 17 other tests taking place in Amchitka Alaska, Colorado, Mississippi, New Mexico and Nevada outside the NNSS (see Nuclear weapons and the United States for details). 24 tests are classified as British tests held at the NTS. There were 35 Plowshare detonations and 7 Vela Uniform tests; 88 tests were safety experiments and 4 were transportation/storage tests. Motion pictures were made of the explosions, later used to validate computer simulation predictions of explosions. &quot;United States&#x27; table data&quot;.
* Soviet Union: 715 tests (involving 969 devices) by official count, plus 13 unnumbered test failures. Most were at their Southern Test Area at Semipalatinsk Test Site and the Northern Test Area at Novaya Zemlya. Others include rocket tests and peaceful-use explosions at various sites in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. &quot;Soviet Union&#x27;s table data&quot;.
* United Kingdom: 45 tests, of which 12 were in Australian territory, including three at the Montebello Islands and nine in mainland South Australia at Maralinga and Emu Field, 9 at Christmas Island (Kiritimati) in the Pacific Ocean, plus 24 in the United States at the Nevada Test Site as part of joint test series). 43 safety tests (the &quot;Vixen&quot; series) are not included in that number, though safety experiments by other countries are. &quot;The United Kingdom&#x27;s summary table&quot;.
* France: 210 tests by official count (50 atmospheric, 160 underground), four atomic atmospheric tests at C.S.E.M. near Reggane, 13 atomic underground tests at C.E.M.O. near In Ekker in the French Algerian Sahara, and nuclear atmospheric and underground tests at and around Fangataufa and Moruroa Atolls in French Polynesia. Four of the In Ekker tests are counted as peaceful use, as they were reported as part of the CET&#x27;s APEX (Application pacifique des expérimentations nucléaires, “Peaceful Application of Nuclear Experiments”), and given alternate names. &quot;France&#x27;s summary table&quot;.
* China: 45 tests (23 atmospheric and 22 underground), at Lop Nur Nuclear Weapons Test Base, in Malan, Xinjiang There are two additional unnumbered failed tests. &quot;China&#x27;s summary table&quot;.
* India: Six underground explosions (including the first one in 1974), at Pokhran. &quot;India&#x27;s summary table&quot;.
* Pakistan: Six underground explosions at Ras Koh Hills and the Chagai District. &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s summary table&quot;.
* North Korea: North Korea is the only country in the world that still tests nuclear weapons, and their tests have caused escalating tensions between them and the United States. Their most recent nuclear test was on September 3, 2017. &quot;North Korea&#x27;s summary table&quot;
There may also have been at least three alleged but unacknowledged nuclear explosions (see list of alleged nuclear tests) including the Vela incident.

From the first nuclear test in 1945 until tests by Pakistan in 1998, there was never a period of more than 22 months with no nuclear testing. June 1998 to October 2006 was the longest period since 1945 with no acknowledged nuclear tests.

A summary table of all the nuclear testing that has happened since 1945 is here: Worldwide nuclear testing counts and summary.

== Global fallout ==
Nuclear weapons testing did not produce scenarios like nuclear winter as a result of a scenario of a concentrated number of nuclear explosions in a nuclear holocaust, but the thousands of tests, hundreds being atmospheric, did nevertheless produce a global fallout that peaked in 1963 (the bomb pulse), reaching levels of about 0.15 mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background radiation dose from all sources, and has slowly decreased since, with natural environmental radiation levels being around 1 mSv. This global fallout was one of the main drivers for the ban of nuclear weapons testing, particularly atmospheric testing. It has been estimated that by 2020 up to 2.4 million people have died as a result of nuclear weapons testing.

==Criticism==

Nuclear arms tests have been criticized for its arms race and its fallout, with a potentially global fallout.

Nuclear weapons tests have been criticized by anti-nuclear activists as nuclear imperialism, colonialism, ecocide, environmental racism and nuclear genocide.

The movement gained particularly in the 1960s and in the 1980s again.

The international day &quot;End Nuclear Tests Day&quot; raises critical awareness annually.

==Treaties against testing==
There are many existing anti-nuclear explosion treaties, notably the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. These treaties were proposed in response to growing international concerns about environmental damage among other risks. Nuclear testing involving humans also contributed to the formation of these treaties. Examples can be seen in the following articles:

* Desert Rock exercises
* Totskoye range nuclear tests

The Partial Nuclear Test Ban treaty makes it illegal to detonate any nuclear explosion anywhere except underground, in order to reduce atmospheric fallout. Most countries have signed and ratified the Partial Nuclear Test Ban, which went into effect in October 1963. Of the nuclear states, France, China, and North Korea have never signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

The 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) bans all nuclear explosions everywhere, including underground. For that purpose, the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization is building an international monitoring system with 337 facilities located all over the globe. 85% of these facilities are already operational. , the CTBT has been signed by 183 States, of which 157 have also ratified. For the Treaty to enter into force it needs to be ratified by 44 specific nuclear technology-holder countries. These &quot;Annex 2 States&quot; participated in the negotiations on the CTBT between 1994 and 1996 and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at that time. The ratification of eight Annex 2 states is still missing: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Treaty; India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it.

The following is a list of the treaties applicable to nuclear testing:

==Compensation for victims==
Over 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980. As public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout, various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that nuclear fallout might have led to approximately 11,000 excess deaths, most caused by thyroid cancer linked to exposure to iodine-131.

* United States: Prior to March 2009, the US was the only nation to compensate nuclear test victims. Since the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation. As of 2017, the US government refused to pay for the medical care of troops who associate their health problems with the construction of Runit Dome in the Marshall Islands.
* France: In March 2009, the French Government offered to compensate victims for the first time and legislation is being drafted which would allow payments to people who suffered health problems related to the tests. The payouts would be available to victims&#x27; descendants and would include Algerians, who were exposed to nuclear testing in the Sahara in 1960. Victims say the eligibility requirements for compensation are too narrow.
* United Kingdom: There is no formal British government compensation program. Nearly 1,000 veterans of Christmas Island nuclear tests in the 1950s are engaged in legal action against the Ministry of Defense for negligence. They say they suffered health problems and were not warned of potential dangers before the experiments.
* Russia: Decades later, Russia offered compensation to veterans who were part of the 1954 Totsk test. There was no compensation to civilians sickened by the Totsk test. Anti-nuclear groups say there has been no government compensation for other nuclear tests.
* China: China has undertaken highly secretive atomic tests in remote deserts in a Central Asian border province. Anti-nuclear activists say there is no known government program for compensating victims.

==Milestone nuclear explosions==
The following list is of milestone nuclear explosions. In addition to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first nuclear test of a given weapon type for a country is included, as well as tests that were otherwise notable (such as the largest test ever). All yields (explosive power) are given in their estimated energy equivalents in kilotons of TNT (see TNT equivalent). Putative tests (like Vela incident) have not been included.

;Note
* &quot;Staged&quot; refers to whether it was a &quot;true&quot; thermonuclear weapon of the so-called Teller–Ulam configuration or simply a form of a boosted fission weapon. For a more complete list of nuclear test series, see List of nuclear tests. Some exact yield estimates, such as that of the Tsar Bomba and the tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, are somewhat contested among specialists.

<text>Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge is a 7,055 acre (28.6 km2) wildlife refuge located 5 miles south-east of Dardanelle, Arkansas.

The Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge is bounded on one side by the Arkansas River and on its other sides by an oxbow lake that was formerly the main channel of the Arkansas. The oxbow lake was formed in 1954 by the Army Corps of Engineers during their efforts to straighten the Arkansas River navigation channel. The island that was formed by this project between the old and new channels was transferred to the US Department of the Interior in 1957 for use as a wildlife refuge. The land was formerly agricultural land but was abandoned after the 1927 flood.

The primary function of this refuge is to provide a winter home for ducks and geese that migrate from the north along the Mississippi Flyway each year. Up to 100,000 of these fowl live in the refuge during the winter months.

<text>&quot;Sube a mi Motora&quot; (commonly referred as &quot;Súbete a mi Moto&quot;) is a song by Menudo from their 1981 album &quot;Quiero Ser&quot;. It became arguably the album&#x27;s most popular song, topping the charts in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Venezuela. It is considered by many Menudo fans to have been the group&#x27;s best song ever and their signature song. Rene Farrait was the lead singer for this song.

&quot;Súbete a mi Moto&quot; (&quot;Get on my motorcycle&quot; in English) created some controversy in Puerto Rico, because in Puerto Rico &quot;moto&quot;, at the moment the song came out, was the term used for illegal drugs (marihuana cigarette). Because of that, the song&#x27;s name was different in Mexico than the original name using the term &quot;motora&quot;. The Mexican version also became known across Latin America and was used in Menudo&#x27;s 1982 film, &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot;, where Farrait&#x27;s substitute, Charlie Masso, sang it. Later, Roy Rossello also sang the theme as lead singer. 13 years after the song was out, member Ashley Ruiz eventually sang it as part of the &quot;Menudo Medley&quot;, then it was covered in the MDO album in 1997, when it was sung by Anthony Galindo.

&quot;Sube a mi Motora (Súbete a mi moto)&quot; was usually the last song performed at Menudo concerts during the era that the song was a hit. When six members of Menudo returned to the stage in 1998 during their &quot;El Reencuentro&quot; comeback tour, &quot;Sube a mi Motora&quot; was always the last song performed by the former Menudo&#x27;s and Farrait ended the shows by driving a motorcycle around.

An English version was released as &quot;Motorcycle Dreamer&quot; in Reaching Out, with Miguel Cancel first covering the song, then Ricky Melendez (after Cancel left the band) as lead singer. That same year, the song was released in their first Portuguese Album Mania called &quot;Sobe em Minha Moto&quot; and it became a hit in Brazil, with Melendez singing it. 

According to some online websites, the song is about experiencing freedom.

==Partial lyrics==
*&quot;¡Súbete a mi moto! ¡Nunca has conocido, un amor tan veloz! ¡Súbete a mi moto! ¡Ella guardará, el secreto de dos, de los dos!&quot; (loosely translated to: &quot;Get on my motorcycle! You have never known, such a fast romance! Get on my motorcycle! It (the motorcycle) will keep, the secret of two, of you and me!&quot;)

==Video==
At the time the song was released in 1981, musical videos were a relatively new way to promote songs, and this was the first song for which the band recorded a video for, The video features Rene Farrait as the lead singer and the boys driving their bikes around as they sing. Band members have expressed that they really enjoyed riding on motorcycles at the time and each owned a motorcycle in real life.

<text>King Ling of Zhou (), personal name Ji Xiexin, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty. He died in 545 BC.

In the twenty-first year of his reign, Confucius was born.

His was succeeded by his son, King Jǐng.

His other son was the crown prince Ji Jin (姬晉). Empress Wu Zetian claimed that her lover Zhang Changzong was a reincarnation of Ji Jin.

==Ancestor of the Taiyuan Wang==

During the Tang dynasty the Li family of Zhaojun , the Cui family of Boling , the Cui family of Qinghe , the Lu family of Fanyang , the Zheng family of Xingyang , the Wang family of Taiyuan , and the Li family of Longxi were the seven noble families among whom marriage was banned by law. Moriya Mitsuo wrote a history of the Later Han-Tang period of the Taiyuan Wang. Among the strongest families was the Taiyuan Wang. The prohibition on marriage between the clans issued in 659 by the Gaozong Emperor was flouted by the seven families since a woman of the Boling Cui married a member of the Taiyuan Wang, giving birth to the poet Wang Wei. He was the son of Wang Chulian who in turn was the son of Wang Zhou. The marriages between the families were performed clandestinely after the prohibition was implemented on the seven families by Gaozong. The Zhou dynasty King Ling&#x27;s son Prince Jin is assumed by most to be the ancestor of the Taiyuan Wang. The Longmen Wang were a cadet line of the Zhou dynasty descended Taiyuan Wang, and Wang Yan and his grandson Wang Tong hailed from this cadet line. 
Both Buddhist monks and scholars hailed from the Wang family of Taiyuan such as the monk Tanqian. The Wang family of Taiyuan included Wang Huan. Their status as &quot;Seven Great surnames&quot; became known during Gaozong&#x27;s rule. The Taiyuan Wang family produced Wang Jun who served under Emperor Huai of Jin. 
A Fuzhou based section of the Taiyuan Wang produced the Buddhist monk Baizhang.

<doc id="337793" wikidata="Q615046" url="?curid=337793" title="Letter of Aristeas">
<text>The Letter of Aristeas to Philocrates is a Hellenistic work of the 3rd or early 2nd century BC, considered by some Biblical scholars to be pseudepigraphical. The letter is the earliest text to mention the Library of Alexandria.

Josephus, who paraphrases about two-fifths of the letter, ascribes it to Aristeas of Marmora and to have been written to a certain Philocrates. The letter describes the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible by seventy-two interpreters sent into Egypt from Jerusalem at the request of the librarian of Alexandria, resulting in the Septuagint translation. Some scholars have since argued that it is fictitious.

== History ==
The Letter of Aristeas, called so because it was a letter addressed from Aristeas of Marmora to his brother Philocrates, deals primarily with the reason the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law, also called the Septuagint, was created, as well as the people and processes involved. The letter&#x27;s author claims to be a courtier of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (reigned 281-246 BC).

Over twenty Greek manuscript copies of the letter are known to survive, dating from the 11th to the 15th century. The letter is also mentioned and quoted in other ancient texts, most notably in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; by Josephus (c. 93 AD), in &quot;Life of Moses&quot; by Philo of Alexandria (c. AD 15), and in an excerpt from Aristobulus of Alexandria (c. 160 BC) preserved in &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot; by Eusebius.

In detail, the work relates how the king of Egypt, presumably Ptolemy II Philadelphus, is urged by his chief librarian Demetrios of Phaleron to have the Hebrew Law translated into Greek, and so add the knowledge of the Hebrews to the vast collection of books the empire had already collected. The king responds favorably, including giving freedom to Jews who had been taken into captivity by his predecessors, and sending lavish gifts (which are described in great detail) to the Temple in Jerusalem along with his envoys. The high priest chooses exactly six men from each of the twelve tribes, giving 72 in all; he gives a long sermon in praise of the Law. When the translators arrive in Alexandria the king weeps for joy and for the next seven days puts philosophical questions to the translators, the wise answers to which are related in full. The 72 translators then complete their task in exactly 72 days. The Jews of Alexandria, on hearing the Law read in Greek, request copies and lay a curse on anyone who would change the translation. The king then rewards the translators lavishly and they return home. Elements of this narrative are re-told in the Babylonian Talmud in Tractate Megillah.

A main goal of the 2nd-century author seems to be to establish the superiority of the Greek Septuagint text over any other version of the Hebrew Bible. The author is noticeably pro-Greek, portraying Zeus as simply another name for the God of Israel, and while criticism is lodged against idolatry and Greek sexual ethics, the argument is phrased in such a way as to attempt to persuade the reader to change, rather than as a hostile attack. The manner in which the author concentrates on describing Judaism, and particularly its temple in Jerusalem could be viewed as an attempt to proselytise.

==Criticism==
Scholars have noted that Demetrios of Phaleron, a client of Ptolemy I Soter, is not a good candidate as a collaborator with Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Roger S. Bagnall notes that Demetrios made a strategic mistake at the beginning of Soter&#x27;s reign, supporting the ruler&#x27;s older half-brother, and was punished with internal exile, dying soon afterwards.

The Spanish humanist Luis Vives is sometimes quoted as having been the first to have exposed the fictitious character of the Letter, in his &quot;In XXII libros de civitate Dei commentaria&quot; (Basel: Frobenius, 1522), on Aug. Book XVIII, 42, but a reading of Vives&#x27; Latin text reveals that he only transmitted Jerome&#x27;s criticisms of the Aristeas story, and added nothing critical of his own account. 

The inconsistencies and anachronisms of the author, exposed by many 17th-century scholars were collected and presented by Humphrey Hody (1659–1706), Hody placed the writing closer to 170–130 BC. His Oxford dissertation of 1685 provoked an &quot;angry and scurrilous reply&quot; from Isaac Vossius (1618–1689), who had been librarian to Queen Christina of Sweden, in the appendix to his &quot;Observations on Pomponius Mela&quot;, 1686, to which Hody conclusively replied in notes to his reprint of 1705. Due to this, the author of the letter of Aristeas is most often referred to as pseudo-Aristeas. Modern scholarship is unanimously with Hody. 

Victor Tcherikover summed up the scholarly consensus in 1958:&quot;Modern scholars commonly regard the &quot;Letter of Aristeas&quot; as a work typical of Jewish apologetics, aiming at self-defense and propaganda, and directed to the Greeks. Here are some instances illustrating this general view. In 1903 Friedlander wrote that the glorification of Judaism in the letter was no more than self-defense, though &quot;the book does not mention the antagonists of Judaism by name, nor does it admit that its intention is to refute direct attacks&quot;. Stein sees in the letter &quot;a special kind of defense, which practices diplomatic tactics&quot;, and Tramontano also speaks of &quot;an apologetic and propagandist tendency&quot;. Vincent characterizes it as &quot;a small unapologetic novel written for the Egyptians&quot; (i.e. the Greeks in Egypt). Pheiffer says: &quot;This fanciful story of the origin of the Septuagint is merely a pretext for defending Judaism against its heathen denigrators, for extolling its nobility and reasonableness, and first striving to convert Greek speaking Gentiles to it&quot;. Schürer classes the letter with a special kind of literature, &quot;Jewish propaganda in Pagan disguise&quot;, whose works are &quot;directed to the pagan reader, in order to make propaganda for Judaism among the Gentiles&quot;. Andrews, too, believes that the role of a Greek was assumed by Aristeas in order &quot;to strengthen the force of the argument and commend it to non-Jewish readers. Even Gutman, who rightly recognizes that the Letter sprang &#x27;from an inner need of the educated Jew,&#x27; sees in it &#x27;a strong means for making Jewish propaganda in the Greek world.&#x27; ”
But, Tcherikover continues:
&quot;In this article an attempt will be made to prove that the Letter of Aristeas was not written with the aim of self-defense or propaganda, and was addressed not to Greek, but to Jewish readers.&quot;

In 1902, I. Abrahams writes:
&quot;It is, to my mind, no longer improbable that the king would communicate in writing with his librarian as Aristeas asserts, though Hody directs his satire against this very point.&quot;

In 2001, Bruce Metzger writes:
Most scholars who have analyzed the letter have concluded that the author cannot have been the man he represented himself to be but was a Jew who wrote a fictitious account in order to enhance the importance of the Hebrew Scriptures by suggesting that a pagan king had recognized their significance and therefore arranged for their translation into Greek.

Scholars avid for the scant information about the Library and the Musaeum of Alexandria have depended on pseudo-Aristeas, who &quot;has that least attractive quality in a source: to be trusted only where corroborated by better evidence, and there unneeded,&quot; Roger Bagnall concluded.

<text>John Kent (1805 – 1 September 1872) arrived in Newfoundland in 1820 and started working for his uncle, Patrick Morris, a successful businessman and entrepreneur.

He was elected to the first House of Assembly in 1832 as a Liberal. Kent was a champion of Catholic rights on an island that was then deeply divided along religious lines, which his actions directly exacerbated. He was described in the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot; (DCB) as a demagogue who &quot;enjoyed the storm and rode it to his own advantage&quot;, a style of politicking later followed in similar fashion by, among others, Edward Murphy Jr. (of Troy, New York) and Richard J. Daley (of Chicago). The DCB states, &quot;Kent&#x27;s electioneering was a compound of his own strident vitality, intimidation, and clerical influence. Newfoundland in 1832 had virtually universal suffrage under a household franchise, and it was not difficult to secure election by turbulent, and very effective means. Kent was of the school of Reformers who relished quarrels with authority.&quot;

He worked for the reform movement along with his uncle, Philip Morris, and William Carson, which successfully persuaded the British Colonial Office to institute responsible government in Newfoundland. Kent became Colonial Secretary under Philip Francis Little.

From 1848–55 he was Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. He became Premier after Little resigned in 1858. He won the election of 1859 but his government was engulfed by crisis in 1861 when it tried to lower the salary of government officials, including judges who sued the government.

In the legislature, Kent accused Governor Sir Alexander Bannerman and the opposition Conservatives of conspiring with the judges against the government. Bannerman, who despised Kent&#x27;s &quot;dictatorial methods and disliked his administration&quot;, responded by dismissing Kent&#x27;s government in March 1861, which Kent described as a &quot;gross act of treachery&quot;.

The Liberals defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence. The Conservatives narrowly defeated Kent&#x27;s Liberals in a sometimes violent election campaign fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. Riots erupted in the heavily Catholic Harbour Grace area when Bannerman cancelled voting there. Later that same year, 1861, Hugh Hoyles was appointed by Bannerman as Conservative Premier of the new government.

==Death==
Kent died at St John&#x27;s on 1 September 1872. His wife, a sister of Michael Anthony Fleming, Bishop of Newfoundland, and at least two of their children, survived him.

<doc id="337805" wikidata="Q201300" url="?curid=337805" title="Velvet scoter">
<text>The velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca) is a large sea duck, which breeds over the far north of Europe and the Palearctic west of the Yenisey basin. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;. The species name is from the Latin &quot;fuscus&quot; &quot;dusky brown&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The velvet scoter was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas fusca&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as European seas but restricted this to the Swedish coast in 1761. The velvet scoter is now one of six species placed in the genus &quot;Melanitta&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;fusca&quot; is from Latin &quot;fuscus&quot; meaning &quot;dusky&quot;, &quot;black&quot; or &quot;brown&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The velvet scooter was formerly considered to be conspecific with the white-winged scoter (&quot;Melanitta deglandi&quot;) of North America and Stejneger&#x27;s scoter (&quot;Melanitta stejnegeri&quot;) of eastern Siberia and northwest Mongolia.

==Description==
The velvet scoter is in length and has a wingspan of . It is a relatively large sea duck with a thick neck, a long broad bill and a pointed tail. The plumage of the male is glossy black with large white wing patches and small white patches behind the eye. The bill is partly orange. The female is similar to the male but lacks the gloss on the feathers and is duller and browner.

==Distribution==
They breed in northern Europe, from Norway to the Yenisey River in central Siberia and also northeast Kazakhstan. It winters farther south in temperate zones, Europe as far south as Great Britain, and on the Black and Caspian Sea. Small numbers reach France and northern Spain. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together.

Lake Tabatskuri in the region of Samtskhe-Javakheti, Georgia, holds the last breeding population of velvet scoters in the Caucasus. Studies into this population in 2017–2018 found 25–35 pairs at the lake, with substantially fewer nesting. Competition for nesting locations, predation on velvet scoters by gulls, and disturbance by fishing activities were identified as contributing factors to reproductivity rates that were considered as &quot;poor&quot;.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. The nest is built by the female and is placed in thick vegetation and is well concealed. The clutch is typically 7–9 creamy white eggs which measure . Beginning after the last egg is laid, they are incubated for 27–28 days by the female. The eggs are covered with down when the female is off the nest. The young are precocial and nidifugous and feed themselves. They are cared for by the female and become independent after 30–40 days. They first breed when aged two years.

===Food and feeding===
This duck dives for crustaceans and molluscs.

==Conservation status==
The velvet scoter is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="337808" wikidata="Q2020137" url="?curid=337808" title="White-winged scoter">
<text>The white-winged scoter (Melanitta deglandi) is a large sea duck. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;. The species name commemorates French ornithologist Côme-Damien Degland.

==Description==
The white-winged scoter is one of three North American scoter species and the largest species of scoter. Females range from and , averaging and . The male ranges from and from , averaging and . The white-winged scoter has a wingspan of 31.5 in (80 cm). This species is characterized by its bulky shape and large bill, which is feathered at the gape unlike the blocky bill base of the surf scoter. The white secondary flight feathers by which the species is named is visible in flight, but may be concealed when swimming.

The male is all black, except for white around the eye and a white speculum. The bill is orange and red with a large black knob at the base. It takes three years for definitive (adult) plumage to be attained – second-year males resemble adult males but exhibit reduced eye markings and have browner flanks. Females are brownish overall and best distinguished from other scoters by the feathered gape and body shape. The facial pattern in female-type birds is highly variable – younger individuals have conspicuous white spots in front and behind the eye, while adults may lack these patches and appear entirely chocolate brown in winter. Juveniles resemble females but have more distinct facial patches and a mottled white belly. The greater secondary coverts of juvenile males have more extensive white than juvenile females which exhibit little to no white fringing.

There are a number of differing characteristics of the Stejneger&#x27;s scoter and the white-winged scoter. Males of the white-winged scoter have browner flanks, dark yellow coloration of most of the bill and a less tall bill knob, approaching the velvet scoter. The male Stejneger&#x27;s scoter has a very tall knob at the base of its mostly orange-yellow bill. Female of both species are very similar and best distinguished by head shape; White-winged Scoters tend to have &quot;two-stepped&quot; profile between the bill and the head, compared to the long &quot;Roman nose&quot; profile of Stejneger&#x27;s Scoter similar to that of a common eider. Additionally, the feathering along the base of the upper mandible forms a right angle on the White-winged scoter, compared to the acute angle on the Stejneger&#x27;s Scoter.

The Latin binomial commemorates the French zoologist Dr. Côme-Damien Degland (1787–1856).

==Taxonomy==
It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the velvet scoter, and some taxonomists still regard it as so. These two species, the Stejneger&#x27;s scoter, and the surf scoter, are placed in the subgenus &quot;Melanitta&quot;, distinct from the subgenus &quot;Oidemia&quot;, black and common scoters. Stejneger&#x27;s scoter was suggested to be a full species, according to a new study.

Birds in Alaska are sometimes recognized as a distinct subspecies, &quot;M. d. dixoni&quot;, which is reported to have shorter and broader bills on average, but most authorities consider these differences insufficient to warrant taxonomic distinction.

==Distribution==
White-winged Scoters have the largest breeding range among North American scoters. They mainly breed in boreal forest from Alaska to Western Canada and are less common east towards the Hudson Bay and south towards the Canadian Prairies. It winters further south in temperate zones, on the Great Lakes, the coasts of the northern United States and the southern coasts of Canada.. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together. It has occurred as a vagrant in Europe, including Scotland, Iceland, Norway and Ireland,

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
White-winged Scoters are monogamous and form pairs in late summer, suggesting long-term pair bonds. Their earliest breeding age is two years old. Some adults do not breed annually and gather on large lakes and marshes over summer.

The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. Five to eleven eggs are laid. The pinkish eggs average in breadth, in length and in weight. The incubation period can range from 25 to 30 days. Males remain with females during the egg-laying period, and typically gather in small groups before leaving the breeding grounds when the young have hatched. After about 21 days, neighboring females may start to behave aggressively towards other nesting females, resulting in confusion and mixing of broods. By the time she is done brooding, a female may be tending to as much as 40 offspring due to the mixing from these conflicts. The female will tend to her brood for up to three weeks and then abandon them, but the young will usually stay together from another three weeks. Brood amalgamation is not uncommon in areas in densely populated breeding grounds, with as many as 100 ducklings gathering in a creche. Flight capacity is thought to be gained at 63 to 77 days of age.

===Diet===
White-winged scoters are benthic feeders and forage in open water diving between 5 and 20 m in wintering grounds and 1 and 3 m on breeding grounds. Their large size enables them to find larger prey and dive deeper than Surf or Black Scoters. In freshwater, this species primarily feeds on crustaceans and insects; while in saltwater areas, it feeds on molluscs and crustaceans. Their gizzards, which forms 8% of their body mass, are capable of crushing hard-shelled molluscs. The favorite foods are an amphipod (&quot;Hyalella azteca&quot;) in freshwater, and rock clams (&quot;Protothaca staminea&quot;), Atlantic razor clams (&quot;Siliqua&quot; spp.), and Arctic wedge clams (&quot;Mesodesma arctatum&quot;).

<text>White tie, also called full evening dress or a dress suit, is the most formal evening Western dress code. For men, it consists of a black tail coat (alternatively referred to as a dress coat, usually by tailors) worn over a white dress shirt with a starched or piqué bib, white piqué waistcoat and the white bow tie worn around a standing wing collar. Mid or high-waisted black trousers with &quot;galon&quot;, a braid of trim consisting of two silk stripes to conceal the outer seams of the trousers, along with court shoes (British English) (pumps in American English) complete the outfit. Orders, decorations and medals may be worn. Acceptable accessories include a black top hat, white gloves, a white scarf, a pocket watch, a white pocket square, and a boutonnière. Women wear full-length ball or evening gowns with evening gloves and, optionally, tiaras, jewellery, and a small handbag.

The dress code&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the end of the 18th century. New fully black-coloured justaucorps styles emerged around the Age of Revolution, notably adopted by the bourgeois third estate of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France. Increasingly following the French Revolution, high society men abandoned the richly decorated justaucorps coats for more austere cutaway dress coats in dark colours, with cuts perhaps further inspired by the frocks and riding coats of country gentlemen. Gradually replacing also breeches, lacy dress shirts and jabots with plain white dress shirts, shorter waistcoats, white cravats and , this became known as directoire style. By the early 19th-century Regency era, dark dress tailcoats with light trousers became standard daywear, while black and white became the standard colours for evening wear. Although the directoire style was replaced for daytime by black frock coats and bowties by mid-19th century, cutaway black dress tailcoats with white bowtie has remained established for formal evening wear ever since.

Despite the emergence of the more comfortable semi-formal black tie dress code in the 1880s, full evening dress tailcoats remained the staple. Towards the end of the Victorian era, white bow ties and waistcoats became the standard for full evening dress, contrasting with black bow ties and waistcoats or cummerbunds for black tie.

Following the social changes after the First World War and especially with the counterculture of the 1960s, white tie was increasingly replaced by black tie as default evening wear for more formal events. Since the late 20th century, white tie tends to be reserved for the most formal evening occasions, such as at banquets following investitures, state dinners and audiences, in addition to formal balls and galas such as the Vienna Opera Ball in Austria, the Nobel Prize banquet in Stockholm, Mardi Gras balls in New Orleans, Commemoration balls at Oxford and May balls at Cambridge, and the Al Smith Memorial Dinner in New York. White tie still also occurs at traditional weddings and church celebrations, at certain societies and fraternities, as well as occasionally around some traditional European universities and colleges.

==History==
=== 19th century: origins and development ===
Throughout the Early Modern period, western European male courtiers and aristocrats donned elaborate clothing at ceremonies and dinners: coats (often richly decorated), frilly and lacy shirts and breeches formed the backbone of their most formal attire. As the 18th century drew to a close, high society began adopting more austere clothing which drew inspiration from the dark hues and simpler designs adopted by country gentlemen. By the end of the 18th century, two forms of tail coat were in common use by upper-class men in Britain and continental Europe: the more formal dress coat (cut away horizontally at the front) and the less formal morning coat, which curved back from the front to the tails. From around 1815, a knee-length garment called the frock coat became increasingly popular and was eventually established, along with the morning coat, as smart daywear in Victorian England. The dress coat, meanwhile, became reserved for wear in the evening. The dandy Beau Brummell adopted a minimalistic approach to evening wear—a white waistcoat, dark blue tailcoat, black pantaloons and striped stockings. Although Brummell felt black an ugly colour for evening dress coats, it was adopted by other dandies, like Charles Baudelaire, and black and white had become the standard colours by the 1840s.

Over the course of the 19th century, the monotone colour scheme became a codified standard for evening events after 6 p.m. in upper class circles. The styles evolved and evening dress consisted of a black dress coat and trousers, white or black waistcoat, and a bow tie by the 1870s. The dinner jacket (black tie/tuxedo) emerged as a less formal and more comfortable alternative to full evening dress in the 1880s.

By the early 20th century, full evening dress meant wearing a white waistcoat and tie with a black tailcoat and trousers; white tie had become distinct from black tie. Despite its growing popularity, the dinner jacket remained the reserve of family dinners and gentlemen&#x27;s clubs during the late Victorian period.

===20th century===
By the turn of the 20th century, full evening dress consisted of a black tailcoat made of heavy fabric weighing . Its lapels were medium width and the white shirt worn beneath it had a heavily starched, stiff front, fastened with pearl or black studs and either a winged collar or a type called a &quot;poke&quot;, consisting of a high band with a slight curve at the front. After World War I, the dinner jacket became more popular, especially in the US, and informal variations sprang up, like the soft, turn-down collar shirt and later the double-breasted jacket; relaxing social norms in Jazz Age America meant white tie was replaced by black tie as the default evening wear for young men, especially at nightclubs. According to &quot;The Delineator&quot;, the years after World War I saw white tie &quot;almost abandoned&quot;. But it did still have a place: the American etiquette writer Emily Post stated in 1922 that &quot;A gentleman must always be in full dress, tail coat, white waistcoat, white tie and white gloves&quot; when at the opera, yet she called the tuxedo &quot;essential&quot; for any gentleman, writing that &quot;It is worn every evening and nearly everywhere, whereas the tail coat is necessary only at balls, formal dinners, and in a box at the opera.&quot;

It also continued to evolve. White tie was worn with slim-cut trousers in the early 1920s; by 1926, wide-lapelled tailcoats and double-breasted waistcoats were in vogue. The Duke of Windsor (then Prince of Wales and later Edward VIII) wore a midnight blue tailcoat, trousers and waistcoat in the 1920s and 1930s both to &quot;soften&quot; the contrast between black and white and allow for photographs to depict the nuances of his tailoring. The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed a resurgence in the dress code&#x27;s popularity, but by 1953, one etiquette writer stressed that &quot;The modern trend is to wear &#x27;tails&#x27; only for the most formal and ceremonious functions, such as important formal dinners, balls, elaborate evening weddings, and opening night at the opera&quot;. 

The last president to have worn white tie at a United States presidential inauguration was President John F. Kennedy in 1961, who wore morning dress for his inauguration, and a white tie ensemble for his inauguration ball.

=== 21st century ===

While rare in the early 21st century, it survives as the formal dress code for royal and public ceremonies and audiences, weddings, balls, and a select group of other social events in some countries.

In London, it is still used by ambassadors attending the Christmas ball offered by King Charles III at Buckingham palace as well as the Lord Mayor dinner at Mansion House.

Notable international recurrent white tie events include the Nobel Prize ceremony in Sweden and the Vienna Opera Ball in Austria.

In Scandinavia and the Netherlands, white tie is the traditional attire for doctoral conferments and is prescribed at some Swedish and Finnish universities, where it is worn with a top hat variant called a doctoral hat. At the universities in Uppsala and Lund in Sweden, it is still common for students to wear white tie at formal events. In Sweden and Finland, a black waistcoat is worn with white tie for academic occasions in the daytime. In the Netherlands, the attendants of the graduate student, called paranymphs, will also wear white tie.

Some fraternities such as Freemasons and Odd Fellows wear dress coats to their meetings.

==== United Kingdom ====

In Britain, it is worn at certain formal occasions such as state banquets, City of London livery dinners and certain balls at Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh and St Andrews universities. The president and officers of the Oxford Union are still required to wear white tie at every debate but since the 1930s, other speakers are only required to wear black tie.

==== United States ====

A few state dinners at the White House apply white tie, such as the one held for Queen Elizabeth II in 2007. Other notable examples include the Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington, D.C., the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City, in additions to a few debutante balls such as the International Debutante Ball in New York City, and the Veiled Prophet Ball in St. Louis.

In the southern United States, white tie is sometimes referred to as &quot;costume de rigueur&quot;, adapted from French language due to the historical background of New France. It is sometimes used in invitations to masquerade balls and Mardi Gras celebrations, such as the Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama, or New Orleans Mardi Gras, Louisiana, emphasising the white tie expectations for men and full-length evening gowns for ladies.

When the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Costume Institute Gala in New York City announced a white tie dress code in 2014, a number of media outlets pointed out the difficulty and expense of obtaining traditional white tie, even for the celebrity guests.

== Composition ==

According to the British etiquette guide &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot;, the central components of full evening dress for men are a white marcella shirt with a wing collar and single cuffs, fastened with studs and cufflinks; the eponymous white marcella bow tie is worn around the collar, while a low-cut marcella waistcoat is worn over the shirt. Over this is worn a black double-breasted barathea wool or ultrafine herringbone tailcoat with silk faced peak lapels. The trousers have two galon down the outside of both legs. The correct shoes are patent leather court shoes. Although a white scarf and evening overcoat remains popular in winter, the traditional white gloves, top hats, canes and cloaks are now rare. Women wear a full-length evening dress, with the option of jewellery, a tiara, a pashmina, coat or wrap, and long white gloves.

The waistcoat should not be visible below the front of the tailcoat, which necessitates a medium or high waistline and often suspenders (braces) for the trousers. As one style writer for GQ magazine summarises &quot;The simple rule of thumb is that you should only ever see black and white not black, white and black again&quot;. While &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot; accepts double cuffs for shirts worn with white tie, most tailors and merchants suggest that single, linked cuffs are the most traditional and formal variation acceptable under the dress code. Double cuffs are not frequently worn or recommended with white tie. Decorations may also be worn and, unlike &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot;, Cambridge University&#x27;s &quot;Varsity&quot; student newspaper suggests a top hat, opera cloak and silver-topped cane are acceptable accessories.

<doc id="337817" wikidata="Q256760" url="?curid=337817" title="Scoter">
<text>The scoters are stocky seaducks in the genus Melanitta. The drakes are mostly black and have swollen bills, the females are brown. They breed in the far north of Europe, Asia, and North America, and winter further south in temperate zones of those continents. They form large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together. Their lined nests are built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. These species dive for crustaceans and molluscs.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Melanitta&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The type species was designated in 1838 as the velvet scoter by Thomas Campbell Eyton. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot;.

The genus contains six species:






A fossil species, &quot;Melanitta kirbori&quot;, is known from the Early Pleistocene of Crimea. The presumed fossil &quot;scoter&quot; &quot;Melanitta ceruttii&quot;, which lived in California during the Late Pliocene, is now placed in the genus &quot;Histrionicus&quot;.

<text>The Floating Admiral is a chain-written, collaborative detective novel written by fourteen members of the British Detection Club in 1931. The twelve chapters of the story were each written by a different author, in the following sequence: Canon Victor Whitechurch, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole, Henry Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode, Milward Kennedy, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Edgar Jepson, Clemence Dane and Anthony Berkeley. G. K. Chesterton contributed a prologue, which was written after the novel had been completed.

In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book.

As Sayers explained in the introduction to the book, &quot;Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view—that is, he must not introduce new complications merely &#x27;to make it more difficult&#x27; ... [E]ach writer was bound to deal faithfully with &quot;all&quot; the difficulties left for his consideration by his predecessors.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
Notable crime fiction critic Jacques Barzun noted:-
==Plot summary==
On a drifted boat, the body of Admiral Penistone is found. Last night, he had dinner with his niece in the house of the vicar. Afterwards he used his own boat to navigate over the river to his home. However, the boat on which the admiral is found is not his property, but is owned by the vicar. The admiral was stabbed by a knife or a dagger, but there is no blood on the floor. Furthermore, the mooring line has been cut.

==List of characters==
*Neddy Ware: a local of the village who owns a boat. He discovered the body of the Admiral, of whose crew Ware once was a part. He is known to generally be peace-loving but can have a temper and a sailor&#x27;s vocabulary when roused.
*Constable Hempstead: a local police officer who was on night duty around the time of the death and spotted a mysterious figure in a car.
*Inspector Rudge: the inspector working on the case of Admiral Penistone&#x27;s murder.
*Reverend (Mr) Mount: the vicar of the village, on whose boat the body of Admiral Penistone is found. His hat is found near the body. He has two sons and a runaway wife who left him for another man.
*Alec Mount: one of Reverend Mount&#x27;s two sons, a sixteen-year-old.
*Peter Mount: one of Reverend Mount&#x27;s two sons, a fourteen-year-old.
*Sir Wilfrid Denny: a friend of Admiral Penistone and a retired civil servant who is fond of his garden. He had ties with the Admiral in China and, strangely, rushed off to London on the morning of the discovery of the Admiral&#x27;s body.
*Elma Holland (née Fitzgerald): a young woman, about thirty or a few years above that age. She wasn&#x27;t beautiful, as judged by Rudge, but if she made herself up she could have been pretty. She is the niece of the Admiral and engaged to Arthur Holland. She has been in the area for a month and is of independent means.
*Arthur Holland: a young, handsome man with a slightly sunburnt face who is engaged to Elma. He is a tradesman who works with materials such as rubber, silk and jute, trading the items for China. He stayed at the Lord Marshall hotel in nearby Whynnmouth at the time of the murder. He secretly marries Elma.
*Mrs Davis: the local gossip and the proprietress of the Lord Marshall at Whynnmouth, who provides Rudge with invaluable details (mostly scandalous in nature).
*Mr Daker: a solicitor and a friend of Mr Fitzgerald (Mr Fitzgerald is the father of Elma and Admiral Penistone&#x27;s brother-in-law): a dryly cautious man with a strong family feeling.
*Walter Fitzgerald: Elma&#x27;s brother, an attractive young man who forged a document while working in China. He has been missing for a period of time and if he comes forward he will be arrested for the forgery - if he doesn&#x27;t he will lose his father&#x27;s inheritance.

<text>The Pottsville [[Escarpment]] is a resistant sandstone belt of cliffs and steep sided, narrow crested valleys in eastern Kentucky, USA. It features rock shelters, waterfalls, and natural bridges. It is also called the Cumberland Escarpment and forms the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau.

It is largely located within the Daniel Boone National Forest, the original area of which was located to specifically include this rugged strip of land.

Several significant natural areas in Kentucky are located within the escarpment zone. These include the Red River Gorge Geologic Area, Natural Bridge State Park, Cumberland Falls, Big South Fork National Recreation Area, and others.

<doc id="337822" wikidata="Q742468" url="?curid=337822" title="Surf scoter">
<text>The surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) is a large sea duck native to North America. Adult males are almost entirely black with characteristic white patches on the forehead and the nape and adult females are slightly smaller and browner. Surf scoters breed in Northern Canada and Alaska and winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. Those diving ducks mainly feed on benthic invertebrates, mussels representing an important part of their diet.

== Taxonomy ==
In 1750 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the surf scoter in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The great black duck from Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of Canada by James Isham. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the surf scoter with the ducks and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Anas perspicillata&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The surf scoter is now one of six species placed in the genus &quot;Melanitta&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The genus name &quot;Melanitta&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot;. The specific name is from the Modern Latin &quot;perspicillatus&quot; meaning &quot;spectacled&quot;, in turn derived from &quot;perspicere&quot; &quot;to see through&quot;.

A cladistic analysis based on several morphological characters placed the surf scoter as a monotypic taxon, closest to the white-winged scoter (&quot;Melanitta deglandi&quot;) and the velvet scoter (&quot;Melanitta fusca&quot;), which are both sister taxa. These three species form the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, which contains the black scoter (&quot;Melanitta americana&quot;) and the common scoter (&quot;Melanitta nigra&quot;).

The genus &quot;Melanitta&quot; is part of the Mergini tribe, a monophyletic group of the Northern Hemisphere. It includes eiders, mergansers, goldeneyes and other sea ducks. This tribe is part of the family Anatidae, along with the swans and geese.

== Description ==
The Surf Scoter reaches sexual maturity after 3 years. The adult male is on average 1,050 g (2.31 lb) and 48 cm (19 in) in length while the adult female averages about 900 g (2.0 lb) and 44 cm (17 in) in length, making this the smallest species of scoter on average. The surf scoter has a wingspan of 29.9–30.3 in (76–77 cm).

The male is completely velvety black except for white patches on the forehead and the nape. It has a swollen bill, appearing orange at a distance but patterned with white, red and yellow, and a black spot near the base.
The female is browner than the male, with a fairly uniform plumage, slightly darker above than below. Indistinct paler patches are present on the cheeks below the eye and sometimes a whitish patch is on the nape, a unique trait among scoters. The bill is black with green or blue colorations
The juvenile has a plumage similar to the female, but mainly paler and browner, and the breast and belly are whitish.

The surf scoter is easily distinguishable from other scoters by the white patch on the head of the adult male and its unique bill pattern. Females and immatures have a bulkier bill with a squarish base and a more flattened head profile than other scoters. The black and the white-winged scoters are physically very similar to the surf scoter but in flight, the surf scoter is the only one with completely dark wings.

Like all sea ducks, the surf scoter becomes flightless during the simultaneous molt of its flight feathers. This vulnerable period happens usually in late July through early August and lasts for about four weeks. This wing molt is the start of a complete body or prebasic molt which is completed in the fall producing the next basic or breeding plumage. Before the prebasic molt, many duck species undergo a partial prealternate molt replacing the bright colors of the basic plumage of males by the duller alternate or eclipse plumage but the prealternate molt is believed to be limited or absent such that males appear similar in both basic and alternate plumage, but may have a browner belly and duller or &quot;messier&quot; appearance in summer.

The plumage is a good indicator of the age for male surf scoters, but not for females. Second-year males are similar to adults but may have brownish feathers and/or lack the white forehead patch.

=== Vocalization ===
Surf scoters are generally silent and their few vocalizations are poorly known. During courtship display, males perform a gurgling call and an explosive &quot;puk-puk&quot;. Females defend their young with a crowlike call. When alarmed, surf scoters will often make a sound like a &quot;guk,&quot; somewhere between a &quot;cluck&quot; and a &quot;tok,&quot; while rapidly surveying their environment or taking to flight en masse.

== Distribution and habitat==
Compared to most Northern American sea ducks, the surf scoter breeds exclusively in North America, mostly in Northern Canada and Alaska. Then, they take different migration routes to spend the winter in more temperate environments.

While small numbers regularly winter in western Europe as far south as the British Isles, the vast majority of surf scoters winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. The Pacific coast host the highest number of individuals and its large wintering range extends over 5000 km, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico.

This migratory species breeds in the boreal forests near northern freshwater lakes. Very few nests have been observed but they tend to be near spruce cover, slightly upland to wetland areas. To complete its molt before migration, the surf scoter travels to a molting site, which differ from the wintering or the nesting site. Because of the vulnerable state of the ducks in those periods, molting sites are assumed to have profitable food and lower predation risks and they are located in bays, inlets or estuaries. 
The surf scoter winters in marine habitats near the shore.

=== Migration ===
Many migration routes have been observed, and the route choice of the surf scoter will depend on the latitude of its nesting site. The departure date of the birds may vary according to their wintering site, but the date of arrival and settling on the nesting site appear to be synchronous. This suggest that because of different factors such as the weather or varied foraging conditions, the individuals adjust their migration timing to meet an optimized reproductive schedule.

The ducks face very different environmental conditions depending on the location of their wintering grounds, which affect their migratory behavior. Higher proportions of males have been located in the northern part while more females and juveniles winter in the southernmost portion of the range. In spring, males and females migrate together to their breeding area and they usually settle at their nesting sites less than a week after arrival.

== Behavior ==
=== Breeding ===
Surf scoters form pairs on wintering and staging grounds. Most pairs are formed before the arrival on the breeding grounds. Studies showed a strong fidelity in the nesting areas of surf scoters over the years.

The building of the nest usually starts in mid-May to early June and it occurs on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. Females dig a bowl-shaped nest in the ground and lines it with nearby ground debris and down. About 5 to 9 eggs are laid and each may range from 55 to 79 g (1.9–2.8 oz) and average 43.9 mm (1.73 in) in breadth and 62.4 mm (2.46 in) in length.

The incubation lasts for about 28 to 30 days and is provided by the female only. Occasional (and likely accidental) brood mixing between different females occurs in areas with high densities of nests and hatching is synchronous among the eggs. The female usually chooses a feeding area less than 2 meters deep and protected from strong winds for its offspring. When they reach those food-rich wetland, they begin feeding on their own. The mother abandons its young before they reach the flight age, at about 55 days.

The fledged offspring congregate in small groups on the breeding area before migrating to the wintering grounds, independently of the adults. Studies in Quebec have demonstrated a duckling mortality of 55–65%, probably influenced by the weather conditions shortly after hatching.

=== Diet and foraging ===
The surf scoter mainly feeds on benthic invertebrates. During the breeding period, surf scoters forage in pairs or small groups on a diverse range of freshwater invertebrates. However, the sea ducks feed on marine organisms for the rest of the year, in flocks ranging from a few individuals to several thousands birds. Important foods include crustaceans, herring spawn, gastropods and small bivalves such as mussels.

In late winter and spring, Surf scoters tend to shift their diet according to the relative profitability of the food, showing a level of opportunism. For example, they start feeding in seagrass beds, on epifaunal crustaceans that have increased in size over winter or on Pacific herring eggs (&quot;Clupea pallasi&quot;), during the fish spawning.
As the prey landscape changes, surf scoters will adjust their foraging effort and habitat selection. Effort is lowest in December, due to high prey abundance, and it increases until mid-February, when prey declines. It increases again in March, probably due to the increasing daylight time for foraging. As the season progresses, surf scoters move to habitats with lower prey declines, instead of staying in habitats poor in prey and increasing their foraging effort.

A surf scoter usually captures its food underwater and consumes it whole. They have been observed to select smaller bivalves than those available, probably because of the energy cost of processing shell matter. They also seem to select slow-swimming epifaunal crustaceans.

Surf scoters consume smaller prey that are located in complex habitat such as mussel beds, which makes them use more visual cues than their congeneric white-winged scoters. They may also visually locate siphons formed by infaunal bivalves to capture them. Gut analysis demonstrated a strong ability to avoid ingesting vegetation while feeding on attached herring eggs.

Flocks of surf scoter appear to dive in a highly synchronous fashion and this synchrony is correlated with the group size. Dive duration vary with many factors such as prey type, density and profitability, season and water depth.
 Surf scoters increase their dive duration when they are feeding on herring spawning, which are harder to capture than sessile bivalves.
Adult scoters of this species dive for crustaceans and molluscs, while the ducklings live off any variety of freshwater invertebrates.

=== Threats ===
In a necrotic study on sea ducks, parasitic diseases were an important cause of mortality. The only parasite found in dead surf scoters was the Acanthocephalan &quot;Polymorphus&quot; spp., which causes peritonitis, an inflammation of the abdomen&#x27;s lining, and possibly emaciation. Out of 39 studied individuals, seven were fatally affected by this worm. A mortality of about 100 surf scoters was also estimated along the coast of California in the spring of 1995. The other mortality causes included emaciation due to starvation (17 individuals), toxicity from petroleum (3 individuals), and trauma from firearm or collisions in different structures (2 individuals).

Predation of eggs and ducklings have not been studied in detail but bald eagles, golden eagles and mustelids have been identified as the main predators of surf scoters in marine habitats. Marked individuals showed a higher mortality rate in winter than during wing molt.

In November, 2007, an oil spill in San Francisco harbour oiled and killed thousands of birds including many surf scoters. About 40% of the birds affected were from this species. Scientists said that while the species is not endangered it has declined 50 to 70% over the past 40 years and this spill could decrease populations since most of the affected birds are healthy adults.

== Status ==

The extremely large range and population size of the surf scoter assures it a status of Least Concerned, according to the IUCN. The populations have been apparently decreasing over the last years, but this small decline is not rapid enough to consider moving the species in the Vulnerable category. The global population is estimated to be between 250,000 and 1,300,000 individuals.

<text>The Slavey (also Awokanak, Slave, and South Slavey) are a First Nations group of Indigenous peoples in Canada. They speak the Slavey language, a part of the Athabaskan languages. Part of the Dene people, their homelands are in the Great Slave Lake region, in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories, northeastern British Columbia, and northwestern Alberta.

==Name==
===Cree exonym &quot;slave&quot;===
&quot;Slavey&quot; or just &quot;Slave&quot; is a translation of Awokanak, the name given to &quot;Dene&quot; by the Cree &quot;who sometimes raided and enslaved their less aggressive northern &quot;. The names of the Slave River, Lesser Slave River, Great Slave Lake, and Lesser Slave Lake all derive from this Cree name. &quot;Esclaves&quot; remains incorporated in the French names of these geographical features, since the French traded with the Cree before the English did. The people now called &quot;Slavey&quot; in English were not necessarily taken as slaves in that period.

===Dehcho autonym===
The name Slavey is seldom used by the people themselves, who call themselves &quot;Dene.&quot; Indigenous ethnonyms for South Slavey people and language are &quot;Dehcho&quot;, Deh Cho Dene (&quot;Mackenzie River People&quot;) or &quot;Dene Tha&quot;.

Though most Athabaskan peoples call themselves &quot;Dene&quot;, those in the Northwest Territories tend to use it for their particular group specifically. However, the northern Slavey are also known in English as the Sahtú, while the southern band are known as the Deh Cho.

== Groups ==
The South Slavey live in northwestern Alberta, northeastern British Columbia, and the southern Northwest Territories. First Nations of South Slavey people:
*The Fort Nelson First Nation (Treaty 8) in British Columbia. Own name: Dene &quot;the people&quot;, for language Dene k&#x27;e. Historical literature Fort Nelson Indian Band, Fort Nelson Slavey Band, Fort Nelson Indians.
*The Dene Tha&#x27; First Nation in Alberta. Own name: for people &quot;Dene Tha″&quot; or &quot;Dene Dháa&quot; &quot;ordinary people&quot;, for language &quot;Dene Dháh&quot;. Historical literature by a number of names, including the following: Upper Hay River Band; Hay Lake(s) Band; Hay River Indians; Slave Band; Slavey Indians at Hay Lake(s); Upper Hay River Post Indians; and Bistcho Lake Tribe.
*The Dehcho First Nations (also called &quot;Deh Cho Dene&quot; – &quot;Mackenzie River Dene&quot;) in the Northwest Territories:
**Acho Dene Koe First Nation – Fort Liard (Ahcho Koe or Ahcho Kue)
**Deh Gáh Got&#x27;ı̨ę First Nation – Fort Providence (Zhahti Koe or Zhahti Kue)
**Jean Marie River First Nation (Tthe&#x27;K&#x27;ehdeli Dene) – Jean Marie River (Tthek&#x27;éhdélį or Tthek&#x27;edeli)
**Katl&#x27;odeeche First Nation (Kátłʼodehche Dene) – Hay River with Hay River Reserve (Xátł&#x27;odehchee)
**Ka&#x27;a&#x27;gee Tu First Nation (Ka&#x27;agee Tu Dene) – Kakisa (K&#x27;ágee)
**Łı́ı́dlı̨ı̨ Kų́ę́ First Nation (Liidli Kue Dene) – Fort Simpson (Liidli Kue)
**Nahɂą Dehé Dene Band (N&#x27;ah adehe Dene) – Nahanni Butte (Tthenáágó)
**Pehdzeh Ki First Nation (Pehdzeh Ki Dene) – Wrigley (Pehdzeh Ki)
**Sambaa K&#x27;e First Nation (Sambaa K&#x27;e Dene) – Sambaa K&#x27;e
**West Point First Nation – West Point (Ts&#x27;ueh Nda – Spruce Point), headquartered in Hay River
The Sahtu, Sahtu Dene (&quot;Great Bear Lake People&quot;) or North Slavey people live exclusively in the Northwest Territories. They speak the North Slavey language.

The Navajo people (Diné) of the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States are said to be descended from the Nahani, who lived where the Nahanni National Park Reserve is, and also the Slavey of Northern Canada.

==In popular culture==
Most residents of Lynx River, the fictional town in which CBC drama &quot;North of 60&quot; is set, are Slavey. Though the word itself is seldom mentioned in dialogue (band members generally identifying themselves as Dene), the town is located in Slavey territory and on one occasion a character proposes a toast before the assembled members in the Slavey language.

<doc id="337829" wikidata="Q2384735" url="?curid=337829" title="Groo the Wanderer">
<text>Groo the Wanderer is a fantasy/comedy comic book character created by Sergio Aragonés. His stories are written and drawn by Aragonés, dialogued and edited by Mark Evanier, lettered by Stan Sakai and colored by Tom Luth. Over the years, Groo has been published by Pacific Comics, Eclipse Comics (one special issue), Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Image Comics and Dark Horse Comics.

Groo was among the first widely successful creator-owned comics creations, one of the few successful humorous series in the United States (outside Archie Comics), and is one of the longest-running collaborations in comic book history. In 2011 IGN ranked Groo 100th in the &quot;Top 100 comic books heroes&quot;.

==The characters==
Groo (the epithet &quot;the Wanderer&quot; is informal and rarely mentioned within the stories) first appeared as a parody of the brutal sword and sorcery heroes that were popular at the time of his creation in the 1970s, especially Conan the Barbarian as presented in Marvel Comics. Groo is a large-nosed buffoon of unsurpassed stupidity who constantly misunderstands his surroundings. Possessed of superlative skills in swordsmanship (the only task at which he is remotely competent, apart from his knack for creating musical instruments), he delights in combat but otherwise is a peaceable and honest fellow who tries to make his way through life as a mercenary or by working odd jobs. He is incredibly accident prone, and despite generally good intentions causes mass destruction wherever he goes. Most of his adventures end with him either oblivious to the mayhem he has wrought or fleeing an angry mob. His penchant for destruction has become so widely known that just the news of Groo approaching is sometimes enough to cause chaos among the population. Groo occasionally meets with respect and good fortune, but it does not last. Businesses, towns, civilizations, and cultures have all been unwittingly destroyed by Groo. Such is Groo&#x27;s incompetence that so much as his stepping onto a ship can cause it to sink.

Groo has slain entire armies with nothing more than his swords, which are a pair of katanas. Groo loves these frays, as he calls them, and often charges into the melee with a cry of &quot;Now Groo does what Groo does best!&quot; He is indiscriminate in the use of his battle skills, usually leaping into the bloodshed before attempting to ascertain the reasons for the fight, or even who is on what side. Even when Groo does join battle intending to fight for a particular side, he is prone to forget which side he is on or be tricked into fighting his unfortunate allies, often causing him to utter &quot;Did I err?&quot; in confusion once everybody is dead.

The following is a sample of the thousands of characters Groo has encountered:
* Captain Ahax, who has, over time with the loss of many vessels under his command, become wise to Groo&#x27;s effect on ships, although he does not know about Rufferto&#x27;s ability to restrain it.
* Arba and Dakarba, a pair of witches who have suffered much trying to take advantage of Groo. They have repeatedly been stripped of their powers because of him. Their names, when put together, spell &quot;abra-kadabra&quot; backwards.
* Arcadio, a handsome warrior with an especially pronounced chin, who is considered the greatest hero of his time, especially by himself. He has often enlisted Groo as his &quot;lackey&quot;, and while Groo has succeeded in his quests time and again, Arcadio always gets the credit.
* Chakaal, a beautiful female warrior, and Groo&#x27;s equal in swordplay. Chakaal is also strong, noble, and wise, and Groo is madly in love with her. She is as well known as a hero and skilled warrior as Groo is for being a walking disaster, and travels the land seeking people in need of her help. Though she respects Groo&#x27;s prowess as a warrior, Chakaal is all too aware of his incompetence in other areas, as well as his general stupidity and lack of social graces, and finds Groo at best tolerable when she is in need of his sword, and contemptible otherwise. Romantically speaking, she considers his idiotic advances repulsive, and does her best to ignore them, though she is not above using Groo&#x27;s feelings for her to convince him to help her in her quests, and will often use Groo as a decoy or sacrificial lamb.
* Granny Groo, Groo&#x27;s gypsy grandmother. Granny Groo often tries to use her grandson to aid her in her moneymaking schemes, but invariably ends up giving him a good spanking when he fails.
* Grativo the Wizard, who often punishes Arba and Dakarba for their failures.
* Grooella, Groo&#x27;s sister. While she greatly resembles her brother, the two of them are totally different: Grooella is a queen. However, her occasional reliance on her brother for aid has spelled disaster every time, and she despises him. Grooella had long, beautiful blond hair as a child, but one of Groo&#x27;s &quot;games&quot; (which nearly always ended in the injury of at least one other child) damaged it so that it became black and frizzy. The Sage developed a one-time-only formula to restore her hair, but Groo &quot;erred&quot; again and rendered the damage permanent.
* The Minstrel, a singing jester who speaks exclusively in rhyming couplets. He often likes to sing of Groo&#x27;s deeds, but Groo seldom appreciates his unflattering descriptions of his bungling. An unusual aspect of the Minstrel is that the ornately carved head of his lute differs in every panel in which it appears. The Minstrel seldom appeared in later issues, due to the difficulty of creating his dialogue: &quot;Mark takes a stance, and if by chance / The Minstrel doesn&#x27;t vanish / Then Mark will go, and Sergio / can write this stuff in Spanish&quot;. He has since returned to being a regular character, especially after Groo inadvertently reunited him with his hitherto unknown young daughter, Kayli, who is now his constant companion.
* Pal and Drumm, two con men. The diminutive Pal is always looking for easy money, but his hulking partner Drumm is not very bright. Their dealings with Groo have often left them in trouble with the people they were scamming. Their names are a play on palindrome.
* Pipil Khan, a short and short-tempered conqueror who speaks like Elmer Fudd. He correctly views Groo as the cause of many of his later attempts at conquest ending in disaster, but having never met the man personally, imagines Groo to be a far more imposing figure than he actually is. When he finally meets the real man who&#x27;s haunted the latter years of his life, the shock kills him.
* Rufferto, Groo&#x27;s dog and inseparable companion. Rufferto ran away from his boring life as a spoiled and pampered royal pet to seek adventure, and endeared himself to Groo. In Rufferto&#x27;s eyes, Groo is a hero and a tactical genius. Initially, Groo viewed Rufferto as a potential meal but eventually came to regard him as his faithful companion. Groo can also safely board a ship in Rufferto&#x27;s presence. His collar is immensely valuable.
* The Sage, a wise, old man who is usually never far from Groo. The Sage often attempts to give Groo sound advice, but Groo&#x27;s stupidity means that the advice is misinterpreted and only makes situations worse. The Sage is never without his dog Mulch. The Sage has known Groo since childhood and often tells his tales for all who are willing to listen. Apart from Rufferto, the Sage is the only character in the Grooniverse who genuinely counts Groo as a friend.
* Taranto, formerly a general, and a friend of Groo, turned bandit leader. He became Groo&#x27;s enemy when he was hired to kill Groo. He has since tried to exploit Groo in his schemes, sometimes successfully, but often being ruined. Groo can never remember whether he is friends with Taranto, or if Taranto wants to kill him. He was one of the first recurring characters to appear. 
* Weaver and Scribe, a successful author and his amanuensis, who look suspiciously like &quot;Groo&quot; own Evanier and Sakai. The Scribe never speaks.
* The Witch of Kaan, an eccentric old hag who always has a potion ready for anybody who visits her.

==The setting==
Groo&#x27;s adventures take place in an environment that generally resembles Medieval Europe, although his travels have also taken him to places that resemble Africa, Indonesia, Japan, the Middle East, and elsewhere. In addition to regular flora and fauna, dragons and other legendary creatures occasionally appear, and several cultures use dinosaur-like creatures as beasts of burden. Over the years, Groo has also encountered several &quot;non-human&quot; cultures such as the Kalelis and the Drazil. The currency in Groo&#x27;s world is usually the Kopin.

Although many technologies and peoples in &quot;Groo&quot; appear ancient, more modern innovations such as the printing press can be found as well.

==The creators==
&quot;Groo&quot; is initially plotted and drawn by Sergio Aragonés, and Mark Evanier then writes the dialog. Sakai then does the lettering, after which Aragonés does the final artwork, including the word balloons. Finally, Luth does the coloring.

Evanier also answers the letters page, something he takes special pride in, since the practice in mainstream comics is to pass this task off to low-level assistants, something he did not know when his own letters as a teenage fan were published. He claims that no one knows what he does. His official credit, during the Marvel/Epic run, was usually a polysyllabic title that changed every issue (examples from the first eight issues of volume 2: Interpreter, Interlocutor, Cryptographer, Amanuensis, Construer, Verbalizer, Articulator, Scholiast). His actual function, as revealed at the end of issue #6 of volume 2, was to interpret Aragones&#x27;s broken English storytelling to write the dialog.

Caricatures of Aragonés, Evanier, Sakai, and Luth often appear as background characters within the stories, sometimes with family members. Evanier and Sakai are also the role models for the characters Weaver and Scribe.

Rufferto was based on Aragonés&#x27;s own dog named Rufferto, who is actually more mottled than spotted.

==Rufferto one page stories==
Starting with issue #87 of Marvel&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Groo&quot; series, issues of Groo ended with a wordless one page gag involving Groo&#x27;s dog Rufferto. When the Groo comic went to Image and Dark Horse comics, these one-page Rufferto stories continued.

In one instance (Groo issue #9 from Image Comics) Rufferto&#x27;s brother Arfetto replaced Rufferto as the star of the backup story.

In all, 93 of these Rufferto one page stories were printed.

==Publication history==
Aragonés created the character of Groo in the late 1970s. At that time no comic book company would allow creators to retain the rights to their characters, and Aragonés did not wish to surrender those rights. In 1981, a comic book, &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; #1, was published by Eclipse Comics as a benefit to raise money for a legal battle over creator rights; a four-page story contributed by Aragonés featured Groo&#x27;s first published appearance. A few months later, Groo appeared in a two-page preview ad and the back cover art in &quot;Starslayer&quot; #4, published by Pacific Comics. The second Groo story appearance was in a five-page backup story in &quot;Starslayer&quot; #5.

In 1982, Pacific Comics began publishing &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; as a regular series. Pacific faced various financial difficulties and was only able to publish eight issues of the title. With Pacific unable to publish new material, a one-shot issue of material that was originally written for them (titled the &quot;Groo Special&quot;) was instead published by Eclipse. When Groo was published by Pacific, he was not portrayed as a bumbling idiot. In fact, one issue had him use his brains to create sophisticated traps and his speech was similar to Conan the Barbarian&#x27;s.

Aragonés and Evanier eventually negotiated a deal with Epic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, for that company to take care of publication while preserving creator rights. This resulted in the longest run of &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; with 120 issues. In 1994, with Marvel facing financial difficulties, the title switched to Image Comics and was retitled &quot;Groo&quot;. In the first issue Groo remarks &quot;the &quot;marvels&quot; of the world are but &quot;images&quot; before me&quot;.

When Image in turn faced legal problems after publishing twelve issues, the title switched to Dark Horse Comics in 1998. Dark Horse did not publish the title as a regular series, but periodically released new material and reprints as miniseries and collections.

At the 2007 WonderCon, the creators revealed that since 2005 they had been trying to produce a &quot;Groo&quot;/&quot;Conan&quot; crossover (both titles being then published by Dark Horse). The project encountered a number of postponements; although two issues had been completed by the spring of 2011, the series was further delayed because of a backache suffered by Aragonés. The book finally saw print in July 2014, with Aragonés and writer Mark Evanier working with artist Thomas Yeates, who drew the Conan portions of the book.

==Similar characters==
The character of the Groosalugg in the TV series &quot;Angel&quot; is generally called &quot;Groo&quot; by other characters, and is a somewhat naïve wandering barbarian hero who is a highly skilled swordsman.

In Norway, the magazine &quot;Pyton&quot; once parodied the comic by placing the Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in the role of Groo, as a pun on her name.

Also in Norway, when the local version of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine ran a parody of &quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the &quot;gray dwarves&quot; pestering Ronia had become &quot;Groo dwarves&quot;.

<doc id="337836" wikidata="Q1130374" url="?curid=337836" title="Laparotomy">
<text>A laparotomy is a surgical procedure involving a surgical incision through the abdominal wall to gain access into the abdominal cavity. It is also known as a celiotomy.

==Origins and history==
The first successful laparotomy was performed without anesthesia by Ephraim McDowell in 1809 in Danville, Kentucky. On July 13, 1881, George E. Goodfellow treated a miner outside Tombstone, Arizona Territory, who had been shot in the abdomen with a .32-caliber Colt revolver. Goodfellow was able to operate on the man nine days after he was shot, when he performed the first laparotomy to treat a bullet wound.

== Terminology ==
The term comes from the Greek word λᾰπάρᾱ (lapara) &#x27;the soft part of the body between the ribs and hip, flank&#x27; and the suffix &quot;-tomy&quot;, from the Greek word τομή (tome) &#x27;(surgical) cut&#x27;.

In diagnostic laparotomy (most often referred to as an exploratory laparotomy and abbreviated ex-lap), the nature of the disease is unknown, and laparotomy is deemed the best way to identify the cause.

In therapeutic laparotomy, a cause has been identified (e.g. colon cancer) and the operation is required for its therapy.

Usually, only exploratory laparotomy is considered a stand-alone surgical operation. When a specific operation is already planned, laparotomy is considered merely the first step of the procedure.

== Spaces accessed ==
Depending on incision placement, laparotomy may give access to any abdominal organ or space, and is the first step in any major diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure of these organs, which include:
* the digestive tract (the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon)
* the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen
* the bladder
* the male prostate
* the female reproductive organs (the uterus and ovaries)
* the retroperitoneum (the kidneys, the aorta, abdominal lymph nodes)

== Types of incisions ==
=== Midline ===
The most common incision for laparotomy is a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen which follows the linea alba.
* The &quot;upper midline incision&quot; usually extends from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.
* A typical &quot;lower midline incision&quot; is limited by the umbilicus superiorly and by the pubic symphysis inferiorly.
* Sometimes a single incision extending from xiphoid process to pubic symphysis is employed, especially in trauma surgery.
Midline incisions are particularly favoured in diagnostic laparotomy, as they allow wide access to most of the abdominal cavity.

=== Midline incision ===
# Cut (incise) the skin in midline 
# Cut (incise) subcutaneous tissue
# Divide the linea alba (white line of the abdomen)
# Pick up peritoneum, confirm that there is no bowel adhesion (intestinal adhesion)
# Nick peritoneum
# Insert finger beneath the wound to make sure that there is no adhesion
# Cut the peritoneum with scissors

=== Other ===
Other common laparotomy incisions include:
* Kocher (right subcostal) incision (after Emil Theodor Kocher); appropriate for certain operations on the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract. This shares a name with the Kocher incision used for thyroid surgery: a transverse, slightly curved incision about 2 cm above the sternoclavicular joints.
* Davis or Rockey–Davis &quot;muscle-splitting&quot; right lower quadrant incision for appendectomy, named for the Oregon surgeon Alpha Eugene Rockey (1857–1927) and the Philadelphia surgeon Gwilym George Davis (1857–1918), who devised such incision style in 1905.
* Pfannenstiel incision, a transverse incision below the umbilicus and just above the pubic symphysis. In the classic Pfannenstiel incision, the skin and subcutaneous tissue are incised transversally, but the linea alba is opened vertically. It is the incision of choice for Cesarean section and for abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease. A variation of this incision is the Maylard incision in which the rectus abdominis muscles are sectioned transversally to permit wider access to the pelvis. This was pioneered by the Scottish surgeon Alfred Ernest Maylard (1855–1947) in 1920.
* Lumbotomy consists of a lumbar incision which permits access to the kidneys (which are retroperitoneal) without entering the peritoneal cavity. It is typically used only for benign renal lesions. It has also been proposed for surgery of the upper urological tract.
* Cherney Incision – developed in 1941 by the American uro-gynecologic surgeon Leonid Sergius Cherney (1908–1963).

==Complications following laparotomy==

Globally, there are few studies comparing perioperative mortality following laparotomy across different health systems. 

A study in the UK with more than 180,000 patients aimed to define a timeframe for quantitative futility in emergency laparotomy and investigate predictors of futility using the United Kingdom National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database. A two-stage methodology was used; stage one defined a timeframe for futility using an online survey and steering group discussion; stage two applied this definition to patients enrolled in NELA December 2013–December 2020 for analysis. Futility was defined as all-cause mortality within 3 days of emergency laparotomy. Results showed that quantitative futility occurred in 4% of patients (7442/180,987) and median age was 74 years. Significant predictors of futility included age, arterial lactate and cardiorespiratory co-morbidity. Frailty was associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality and surgery for intestinal ischaemia was associated with a two times greater chance of futile surgery. These findings suggest that quantitative futility after emergency laparotomy is associated with quantifiable risk factors available to decision-makers preoperatively and should be incorporated into shared decision-making discussions with extremely high-risk patients.

There are also several national studies looking at 30-day mortality in various health systems including the United Kingdom (the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit- NELA) and Australia and New Zealand (ANZELA). One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1.6 percent at 24 hours (high 1.1 percent, middle 1.9 percent, low 3.4 percent; P &lt; 0.001), increasing to 5.4 percent by 30 days (high 4.5 percent, middle 6.0 percent, low 8.6 percent; P &lt; 0.001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69.9 percent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74.2 percent, middle 68.8 percent, low 60.5 percent). Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist associated with reduced mortality at 30 days. 

Taking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency laparotomy from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. Internationally, the most common operations performed were appendectomy, small bowel resection, pyloromyotomy and correction of intussusception. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14 (95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p&lt;0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries.

Absorption of drugs administered orally was shown to be significantly affected following abdominal surgery.
== Related procedures ==
A related procedure is laparoscopy, where cameras and other instruments are inserted into the peritoneal cavity via small holes in the abdomen. For example, an appendectomy can be done either by a laparotomy or by a laparoscopic approach.

There is no evidence of short-term or long-term advantages for peritoneal closure during laparotomy.

<text>Athabaskan ( ; also spelled &quot;Athabascan&quot;, &quot;Athapaskan&quot; or &quot;Athapascan&quot;, and also known as Dene) is a large branch of the Na-Dene language family of North America, located in western North America in three areal language groups: Northern, Pacific Coast and Southern (or Apachean). Kari and Potter (2010:10) place the total territory of the 53 Athabaskan languages at .

Chipewyan is spoken over the largest area of any North American native language, while Navajo is spoken by the largest number of people of any native language north of Mexico.

The word &quot;Athabaskan&quot; is an anglicized version of a Cree language name for Lake Athabasca ( &#x27;[where] there are reeds one after another&#x27;) in Canada. Cree is one of the Algonquian languages and therefore not itself an Athabaskan language. The name was assigned by Albert Gallatin in his 1836 (written 1826) classification of the languages of North America. He acknowledged that it was his choice to use this name for the language family and the associated ethnic groups: &quot;I have designated them by the arbitrary denomination of Athabascas, which derived from the original name of the lake.&quot;

The four spellings—&quot;Athabaskan&quot;, &quot;Athabascan&quot;, &quot;Athapaskan&quot;, and &quot;Athapascan&quot;—are in approximately equal use. Particular communities may prefer one spelling over another (Krauss 1987). For example, the Tanana Chiefs Conference and Alaska Native Language Center prefer the spelling &quot;Athabascan&quot;. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; uses &quot;Athapaskan&quot; in naming the language family and individual languages.

Although the term &quot;Athabaskan&quot; is prevalent in linguistics and anthropology, there is an increasing trend among scholars to use the terms and &quot;Dené languages&quot;, which is how many of their native speakers identify it. They are applying these terms to the entire language family. For example, following a motion by attendees in 2012, the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference changed its name to the Dené Languages Conference.

== Languages ==
Linguists conventionally divide the Athabaskan family into three groups, based on geographic distribution:

# Northern Athabaskan languages
# Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages
# Southern Athabaskan languages or &quot;Apachean&quot;

The 38 Northern Athabaskan languages are spoken throughout the interior of Alaska and the interior of northwestern Canada in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, as well as in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Five Athabaskan languages are official languages in the Northwest Territories, including Chipewyan (), Dogrib or , Gwich&#x27;in (Kutchin, Loucheux), and the Northern and Southern variants of Slavey.

The seven or more Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. These include Applegate, Galice, several Rogue River area languages, Upper Coquille, Tolowa, and Upper Umpqua in Oregon; Eel River, Hupa, Mattole–Bear River, and Tolowa in northern California; and possibly Kwalhioqua-Clatskanie in Washington.

The seven Southern Athabaskan languages are isolated by considerable distance from both the Pacific Coast languages and the Northern languages. Reflecting an ancient migration of peoples, they are spoken by Native Americans in the American Southwest and the northwestern part of Mexico. This group comprises the six Southern Athabaskan languages and Navajo.

The following list gives the Athabaskan languages organized by their geographic location in various North American states, provinces and territories (including some languages that are now extinct). Several languages, such as Navajo and Gwich&#x27;in, span the boundaries: these languages are repeated by location in this list. For alternative names for the languages, see the classifications given later in this article.

===Alaskan Athabaskan languages===
==External classification==

Eyak and Athabaskan together form a genealogical linguistic grouping called &quot;Athabaskan–Eyak&quot; (AE) – well-demonstrated through consistent sound correspondences, extensive shared vocabulary, and cross-linguistically unique homologies in both verb and noun morphology.

Tlingit is distantly related to the Athabaskan–Eyak group to form the Na-Dene family, also known as &quot;Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit&quot; (AET). With Jeff Leer&#x27;s 2010 advances, the reconstructions of Na-Dene (or Athabascan–Eyak–Tlingit) consonants, this latter grouping is considered by Alaskan linguists to be a well-demonstrated family. Because both Tlingit and Eyak are fairly remote from the Athabaskan languages in terms of their sound systems, comparison is usually done between them and the reconstructed Proto-Athabaskan language. This resembles both Tlingit and Eyak much more than most of the daughter languages in the Athabaskan family.

Although &quot;Ethnologue&quot; still gives the Athabaskan family as a relative of Haida in their definition of the Na-Dene family, linguists who work actively on Athabaskan languages discount this position. The Alaska Native Language Center, for example, takes the position that recent improved data on Haida have served to conclusively disprove the Haida-inclusion hypothesis. Haida has been determined to be unrelated to Athabaskan languages.

A symposium in Alaska in February 2008 included papers on the Yeniseian and Na-Dené families. Edward Vajda of Western Washington University summarized ten years of research, based on verbal morphology and reconstructions of the proto-languages, indicating that these languages might be related.

==Internal classification==
The internal structure of the Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan peoples rather than sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way geographic grouping rather than any of the proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation and analysis of the languages improves.

===Overview===
Besides the traditional geographic grouping described previously, there are a few comparatively based subgroupings of the Athabaskan languages. Below the two most current viewpoints are presented.

The following is an outline of the classification according to Keren Rice, based on those published in Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999). It represents what is generously called the &quot;Rice–Goddard–Mithun&quot; classification (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:73), although it is almost entirely due to Keren Rice.
* Athabaskan
** Southern Alaska 
** Central Alaska–Yukon 
** Northwestern Canada 
** Tsetsaut
** Central British Columbia 
** Tsuut&#x27;ina/Sarsi
** Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai
** Pacific Coast Athabaskan 
** Apachean 
Branches 1–7 are the Northern Athabaskan (areal) grouping. Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai (#7) was normally placed inside the Pacific Coast grouping, but a recent consideration by Krauss (2005) does not find it very similar to these languages.

A different classification by Jeff Leer is the following, usually called the &quot;Leer classification&quot; (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:72–74):
* Athabaskan
** Alaskan 
** Yukon 
** British Columbia 
** Eastern 
** Southerly Outlying 
Neither subgrouping has found any significant support among other Athabaskanists. Details of the Athabaskan family tree should be regarded as tentative. As Tuttle and Hargus put it, &quot;we do not consider the points of difference between the two models ... to be decisively settled and in fact expect them to be debated for some time to come.&quot; (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:74)

The Northern group is particularly problematic in its internal organization. Due to the failure of the usual criteria of shared innovation and systematic phonetic correspondences to provide well-defined subgroupings, the Athabaskan family – especially the Northern group – has been called a &quot;cohesive complex&quot; by Michael Krauss (1973, 1982). Therefore, the &quot;Stammbaumtheorie&quot; or family tree model of genetic classification may be inappropriate. The languages of the Southern branch are much more homogeneous and are the only clearly genealogical subgrouping.

Debate continues as to whether the Pacific Coast languages form a valid genealogical grouping, or whether this group may instead have internal branches that are tied to different subgroups in Northern Athabaskan. The position of Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai is also debated, since it may fall in either the Pacific Coast group – if that exists – or into the Northern group. The records of Nicola are so poor – Krauss describes them as &quot;too few and too wretched&quot; (Krauss 2005) – that it is difficult to make any reliable conclusions about it. Nicola may be intermediate between Kwalhioqua–Tlatskanai and Chilcotin.

Similarly to Nicola, there is very limited documentation on Tsetsaut. Consequently, it is difficult to place it in the family with much certainty. Athabaskanists have concluded that it is a Northern Athabaskan language consistent with its geographical occurrence, and that it might have some relation to its distant neighbor Tahltan. Tsetsaut, however, shares its primary hydronymic suffix (&quot;river, stream&quot;) with Sekani, Beaver, and Tsuut&#x27;ina – PA *-ɢah – rather than with that of Tahltan, Tagish, Kaska, and North and South Tutchone – PA *-tuʼ (Kari 1996; Kari, Fall, &amp; Pete 2003:39). The ambiguity surrounding Tsetsaut is why it is placed in its own subgroup in the Rice–Goddard–Mithun classification.

For detailed lists including languages, dialects, and subdialects, see the respective articles on the three major groups: Northern Athabaskan, Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Southern Athabaskan. For the remainder of this article, the conventional three-way geographic grouping will be followed except as noted.

===Northern Athabaskan===
The Northern Athabaskan languages are the largest group in the Athabaskan family, although this group varies internally about as much as do languages in the entire family. The urheimat of the Athabaskan family is most likely in the Tanana Valley of east-central Alaska. There are many homologies between Proto-Athabaskan vocabulary and patterns reflected in archaeological sites such as Upward Sun, Swan Point and Broken Mammoth (Kari 2010). The Northern Athabaskan group also contains the most linguistically conservative languages, particularly Koyukon, Ahtna, Dena&#x27;ina, and Dakelh/Carrier (Leer 2008).
* Northern Athabaskan
** &quot;Southern Alaskan subgroup&quot;
*** Ahtna
*** Dena&#x27;ina (also known as Tanaina, Kenaitze)
** &quot;Central Alaska–Yukon subgroup&quot;
*** Deg Xinag (also known as Deg Hitʼan, Ingalik (deprecated))
*** Holikachuk (also known as Innoko)
*** Koyukon (also known as Denaakkʼe, Tenʼa)
*** Upper Kuskokwim (also known as Kolchan)
*** Lower Tanana and Middle Tanana (also known as Tanana)
*** Tanacross
*** Upper Tanana
*** Southern Tutchone
*** Northern Tutchone
*** Gwich&#x27;in (also known as Kutchin, Loucheux, Tukudh)
*** Hän (also known as Han)
** &quot;Northwestern Canada subgroup&quot;
*** Tahltan–Tagish–Kaska (also known as &quot;Cordilleran&quot;)
**** Tagish
**** Tahltan (also known as Nahanni)
**** Kaska (also known as Nahanni)
*** Sekani (also known as Tsekʼehne)
*** Dane-zaa (also known as Beaver)
*** Slave–Hare
**** Slavey (also known as Southern Slavey)
**** Mountain (Northern Slavey)
**** Bearlake (Northern Slavey)
**** Hare (Northern Slavey)
*** Dogrib (also known as Tłįchǫ Yatiì)
*** Dene Suline (also known as Chipewyan, Dëne Sųłiné, Dene Soun&#x27;liné)
Very little is known about Tsetsaut, and for this reason it is routinely placed in its own tentative subgroup.
** &quot;Tsetsaut subgroup&quot;
*** Tsetsaut (also known as Tsʼetsʼaut, Wetalh)
** &quot;Central British Columbia subgroup&quot; (also known as &quot;British Columbian&quot; in contrast with &quot;Cordilleran&quot; = Tahltan–Tagish–Kaska)
*** Babine–Witsuwit&#x27;en (also known as Northern Carrier, Bulkley Valley/Lakes District)
*** Dakelh (also known as Carrier)
*** Chilcotin (also known as Tsilhqot&#x27;in)
The Nicola language is so poorly attested that it is impossible to determine its position within the family. It has been proposed by some to be an isolated branch of Chilcotin.
** Nicola (also known as Stuwix, Similkameen)
** &quot;Sarsi subgroup&quot;
*** Tsuut&#x27;ina (also known as Sarcee, Sarsi, Tsuu T&#x27;ina)
The Kwalhioqua–Clatskanie language is debatably part of the Pacific Coast subgroup, but has marginally more in common with the Northern Athabaskan languages than it does with the Pacific Coast languages (Leer 2005). It thus forms a notional sort of bridge between the Northern Athabaskan languages and the Pacific Coast languages, along with Nicola (Krauss 1979/2004).
** &quot;Kwalhioqua–Clatskanie subgroup&quot; (also called &quot;Lower Columbia Athapaskan&quot;)
*** Kwalhioqua–Clatskanie (also known as Kwalhioqua–Tlatskanie or Kwalhioqua-Tlatskanai)
===Pacific Coast Athabaskan===

* Pacific Coast Athabaskan
** &quot;California Athabaskan subgroup&quot;
*** Hupa (also known as Hupa-Chilula, Chilula, Whilkut)
*** Mattole–Bear River
*** Eel River (also known as Wailaki, Lassik, Nongatl, Sinkyone)
*** Kato (also known as Cahto)
** &quot;Oregon Athabaskan subgroup&quot;
*** Upper Umpqua (also known as Etnemitane)
**** Lower Rogue River and Upper Coquille (also known as Tututni, Chasta Costa, Euchre Creek and Coquille)
**** Upper Rogue River (also known as Galice/Taltushtuntede, Applegate/Dakubetede)
*** Tolowa (also known as Smith River, Chetco, Siletz Dee-ni)
=== Southern Athabaskan ===

* Southern Athabaskan
** &quot;Plains Apache subgroup&quot;
*** Plains Apache (also known as Kiowa-Apache)
** &quot;Western Apachean subgroup&quot;
*** Chiricahua–Mescalero
**** Chiricahua
**** Mescalero
*** Navajo (also known as Navaho)
*** Western Apache (also known as Coyotero Apache)
** &quot;Eastern Apachean subgroup&quot;
*** Jicarilla
*** Lipan
===Sicoli &amp; Holton (2014)===
Using computational phylogenetic methods, Sicoli &amp; Holton (2014) proposed the following classification for the Athabaskan languages based exclusively on typological (non-lexical) data. However, this phylogenetic study was criticized as methodologically flawed by Yanovich (2020), since it did not employ sufficient input data to generate a robust tree that does not depend on the initial choice of the &quot;tree prior&quot;, i.e. the model for the tree generation.
* Athabaskan
** (Yeniseian)
** (Tlingit–Eyak)
** South Pacific Coast Athabaskan (California)
** (unnamed clade)
*** &quot;Tsetsaut&quot;
*** &quot;Upper Kuskokwim&quot;
*** &quot;Ahtna&quot;
*** &quot;Dena&#x27;ina&quot;

<doc id="337859" wikidata="Q59195" url="?curid=337859" title="Lap dance">
<text>A lap dance (or contact dance) is a type of erotic dance performance offered in many strip clubs in which the dancer typically has body contact with a seated patron. Lap dancing is different from table dancing, in which the dancer is close to a seated patron, but without body contact. Variant terms include couch dance, which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch.

With full-contact lap dances, the dancer may engage in non-penetrative sexual contact with the patron, such as &quot;grinding&quot; or &quot;twerking&quot; their body against the patron. Depending on the local jurisdiction and community standards, the participants in lap dancing are sometimes allowed to touch or be touched by each other. In some clubs any touching by the patron is forbidden. In others there is no oversight by the club and various levels of contact are negotiable between the participants. Clubs vary widely with regard to their enforcement of rules, and some turn a blind eye to any violations.

Lap dancing usually occurs with both participants being either clothed to more or less the same degree, or naked, or the dancer being partially or fully naked, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and the club&#x27;s policies. Some jurisdictions require a prohibition on alcohol if various degrees of nudity are allowed. In other jurisdictions nudity is only allowed where skin contact does not occur between the dancer and the patron, requiring at least one of them to wear clothing. Where specific licensing exists for an establishment to allow prostitution, the dress requirements may also be dependent on that licensing. As the dancer is rarely dressed to a greater degree than the patron, lap dancing is sometimes seen as a submissive act by the dancer.

In some places, a &quot;block session&quot; of lap dances (usually half an hour to an hour) can be booked in a &quot;champagne room&quot; or &quot;VIP room&quot;, which is a private room usually located in the back of a club. In many clubs, the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club&#x27;s DJ. Charges for lap dances vary significantly.

==Controversy==
There is some debate as to whether lap dancing is entertainment or a type of sex work. Critics of lap dancing allege that some club owners, by installing dark private booths and charging dancers steep stage fees, are covertly condoning and encouraging the sale of sexual acts between customers and dancers. This can be a concern if, as for instance in the United Kingdom, the club has a public entertainment licence rather than a sex establishment licence, and in jurisdictions where brothels are illegal.

==History and legal issues==
Lap dancing clubs are a later development of earlier strip clubs, where strippers danced on stage and were paid a wage. In the 1970s, New York&#x27;s Melody Theater introduced audience participation and called it &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;. The Melody Theater became the Harmony Theater and operated in two locations in Manhattan for over 20 years until it was closed down in 1998.

Also during the 1970s, adult film makers Jim and Artie Mitchell had been running an adult movie house, called the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre, in San Francisco to feature their films. But in the second half of the 1970s, with the invention of the videocassette recorder and a proliferation of video cassette rental stores, the demand for adult movie theaters began to plummet. Realizing that they needed a new business model for their building, the Mitchell brothers sent manager Vince Stanich around the country to explore customer-contact shows in sex clubs. After Stanich reported back, the Mitchell brothers responded in 1977 by opening three new rooms at their O&#x27;Farrell Theatre featuring customer-contact shows: The Ultra Room, The Kopenhagen, and New York Live. The Kopenhagen&#x27;s shows were performed by a pair of naked women in a small room with about twenty men. However the club&#x27;s most profitable new venue was New York Live, which was a cabaret-style strip club act with women dancing three song sets upon a stage, while usually being totally nude for the final song.

Most of the strippers who were not dancing were sitting naked on customers&#x27; laps for tips. The amount of tipping rapidly increased and was then marketed as a &quot;lap dance&quot;, and its popularity caused lines of men to regularly appear outside the theater&#x27;s doors. The Mitchells hired new dancers as fast as they could to keep up with demand, and had created another sex-show innovation which gained them international notoriety and generated more money than their film business.

Later in 2004, a San Francisco District Attorney&#x27;s decision to drop prostitution charges against lap dancers in the city changed the sexual culture of San Francisco and &quot;has the potential to influence the policies of other cities&quot;.

In some areas of the U.S. and Canada, local authorities began cracking down on lap dancing after reports that some clubs allowed customers to engage in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity with dancers during lap dance sessions. Various strip clubs have wide-ranging rules on how customers should interact with strippers.

===Canada===
In 1973, an upmarket Vancouver bar called &quot;Gary Taylor&#x27;s Show Lounge&quot; employed showgirls and strippers as waitresses who gave a free dance with every drink. The club was raided by the police under the guise of obscenity legislation, but, in 1974, Judge Jack McGivern ruled that dancer nudity was not obscene, which started a trend of nude dancing in bars. No contact between dancers and patrons was allowed at the club, but Gary Taylor&#x27;s had a boxing ring where the girls performed revealing acrobatics after stripping off and then earned tips. Americans from Washington state made the trip to the club from the United States, which at the time had stricter laws.

In a landmark ruling regarding the 1994 case of Pat Mara and Allan East (the owner and manager of Cheaters Tavern), Judge E. Gordon Hachborn legally defined lap dancing and ruled that it did not contravene Canadian public decency statutes. A number of conflicting judgements were issued in the years that followed, including decisions to close certain bars in which sex acts took place on the floor of the club and other rulings in which patrons were allowed to touch the dancers, as long as an actual sex act did not take place.

In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a typical lap dance did not constitute an &quot;obscene&quot; act within the meaning of the Criminal Code. The Crown did not argue that lap dances constituted &quot;prostitution&quot;, and therefore the court did not address the possible issue that the typical lap dance may contravene one or more anti-prostitution laws. This led to the displacement of strip clubs and table dancing clubs in Canada by lap dancing clubs.

In 2005, two Supreme Court of Canada rulings (R. v. Labaye and R. v. Kouri) decriminalized private sex clubs in Canada.

On 20 December 2013, (in Bedford v. Canada) the Supreme Court of Canada found the laws prohibiting brothels, public communication for the purpose of prostitution, and living on the profits of prostitution to be unconstitutional. The ruling gave the Canadian parliament twelve months to rewrite Canada&#x27;s prostitution laws; in the meantime, existing anti-prostitution laws continued to be enforced. Current laws on prostitution in Canada, introduced in 2014, make it illegal to purchase sexual services (including lap dancing) but legal to sell them.

===Ireland===
In the early 2000s, lap dancing expanded rapidly in the Republic of Ireland, building on an existing strip pub industry. A number of lap-dancing clubs were opened in Dublin, including one by the English nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Lap-dancing clubs were also opened across the country. Many of Ireland&#x27;s lap-dancing clubs have subsequently closed as a result of the worsened economic climate and changes to Ireland&#x27;s licensing laws in 2008. Reputational issues have also played a part in the decline of Ireland&#x27;s lap-dancing clubs.

Police raids took place on Irish lap-dancing clubs in 2003 in search of criminal activity as part of Operation Quest. Efforts to distance Irish lap dancing from the sex industry were hampered by the UK&#x27;s decision in 2010 to classify its lap dancing clubs as sex establishments. Ireland&#x27;s lap-dancing clubs became viewed as more expensive than their rivals overseas and more restricted in terms of the entertainment on offer. By 2012 there were five or six clubs operating in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork. Most lap-dancing clubs in Ireland operate a no-touching rule, and typically do not charge dancers a &quot;house fee&quot; to perform, instead taking a proportion of the dancer&#x27;s earnings.

===United Kingdom===
The first lap dancing club in the UK was opened in 1995. During the 2000s the lap dancing industry grew quickly, with the Licensing Act 2003 as the only legislation in England and Wales regulating lap dancing clubs. The Lap Dancing Association (LDA), a trade association for the UK lap dancing industry, was formed in 2006 and officially launched in 2008. It operated a code of practice for its members. According to a BBC report, as of November 2008, the association represented roughly one-third of the industry&#x27;s clubs. Members included &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Spearmint Rhino&quot;, &quot;Bandit Queen&quot; and &quot;Candy Bar&quot;. In 2008, clubs were being opened at a rate of about one per week.

In April 2008 the LDA proposed that its code of conduct should become legally enforceable by local authorities as part of their licensing function. The association submitted a memorandum to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in November 2008 when the latter was reviewing the Licensing Act 2003. The association said that there was no sexual activity offered for sale in their clubs, and that to classify them as part of the sex industry would stigmatise performers. Simon Warr, who ran the clubs Platinum Lace and For Your Eyes Only and who was the president of the LDA In 2009, gave oral evidence to the committee, describing lap dancing as &quot;not sexually stimulating&quot;. Three MPs undertook a fact-finding visit to a London lap dancing club at the invitation of the LDA. The association opposed the provisions of the subsequent Policing and Crime Act 2009 which reclassified lap-dancing clubs in England and Wales as &quot;sexual entertainment venues&quot; instead of &quot;entertainment venues&quot;, introduced a licensing system for clubs and allowed local authorities to decide the number and location of lap-dancing clubs in their area. Chris Knight, vice-chairman of the LDA, said that the cost of the additional licence required to run a lap dancing club from 2010 could affect many businesses and questioned the right of local authorities to make licensing decisions on &quot;emotive and moralistic grounds&quot;.

In 2009, the total number of clubs had reached its peak of 310 (approximately twice the number in 2003), and the number of lap-dancers was estimated at 10,000. Lap-dancing clubs had opened in big cities, small towns, and out-of-town business parks. The figures plateaued during the subsequent weaker economic climate and had hardly changed by 2012. At that point, the amount of money a lap-dancer earned in an average shift was £230 (down from around £280 in 2011), and the industry was valued at around £300 million. However, some clubs, particularly in London, charged a house fee for the dancers to perform and had an increased number of dancers, which reduced an individual dancer&#x27;s earnings.

Between 2010 and 2015, there were approximately forty-five refusals of licences for sexual entertainment venues in England and Wales, mainly on the grounds that the locality was unsuitable. The legislation provides for no right of appeal against such refusals, except on the grounds that committees have not followed correct procedure. The number of refusals, together with the costs of licence application, means that there have been few new businesses opened since 2010, with the overall number of clubs declining over time as a number of local authorities implemented a &quot;nil limit&quot; for new clubs.

In February 2014, Fiona Mactaggart (MP for Slough) asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, if he would &quot;make it his policy not to offer job subsidies for employing teenagers as auxiliary workers in adult entertainment establishments&quot;. Her question related to employers in the adult entertainment industry being offered an incentive of over £2,000 from the Department for Work and Pensions for every unemployed young person (aged 18–24) that they hired. Esther McVey, the Minister of State for Employment, stated that: &quot;The Welfare Reform Act 2012 ensured that vacancies which involve performing sexual activities were banned from being advertised on Government websites and a distinction was made in law to differentiate between performers and ancillary workers.&quot;

====Scotland====
In 2005 Tom McCabe MSP set up the Adult Entertainment Working Group, an advisory body within the Scottish Government, to investigate the legislative issues involved in a proposed lap dancing ban in Scotland. At that time, lap dancing clubs in Scotland were licensed under Section 41 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which covers general entertainment licenses, and licences in Scotland could not be refused on the basis of the nature of the entertainment in itself. The working group, headed by Linda Costelloe Baker, consisted of academics, lawyers and politicians, and had a working period from April 2005 until April 2006. It commissioned the market research organisation Ipsos MORI to examine the public&#x27;s attitudes towards adult entertainment, completed site visits and took evidence from a variety of witnesses. Respondents to the group&#x27;s consultation included the Church of Scotland. The group reported to Scottish ministers on 25 April 2006.

The group concluded that lap dancing venues are a form of &quot;commercial sexual exploitation...which encompasses pornography, internet sex chat rooms, sex phone lines, escort services, prostitution, trafficking for prostitution, peep shows, lap dancing, pole dancing, table dancing and stripping&quot;. It recommended reviewing the licensing of lap dancing venues and proposed national guidelines to prevent performers from touching or being touched by customers, ensuring that activities are visible at all times, and introducing a minimum age of 18 for everyone involved. A prominent voice of opposition to a lap dancing ban was exotic dancer Veronica Deneuve who set out to try to involve the stripping community in the discussion to inform such legislation. The International Union of Sex Workers said that the &quot;recommendations are flawed and would be extremely detrimental to workers and operators in the industry&quot;.

The Scottish Government accepted a number of the recommendations, but it rejected the idea that licensing boards should be able to determine whether full nudity is appropriate in given locales. It also rejected the idea of a compulsory one-metre no-touching zone between dancer and customer, suggesting that this would be unenforceable. It did, however, propose to enable licensing boards to consider nude dance venues as a separate class of venue. No legislation directly followed the group&#x27;s report. However, the report informed the statement of licensing policy of many licensing boards across Scotland on the introduction of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.

In 2013 the Scottish Government and carried out a consultation on the regulation of &quot;sexual entertainment venues&quot;. This, in combination with the AEWG&#x27;s 2006 report, paved the way for the Scottish Parliament to introduce licensing reform for lap dancing as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2015. This came into effect in 2016 and requires local authorities in Scotland to set out individual policies with regard to the licensing of lap dancing clubs.

====Northern Ireland====
Northern Ireland&#x27;s first lap dancing club was opened by Donegal businessman Jerome Brennan, who already owned lap dancing clubs in Dundalk and Limerick in the Republic of Ireland, mainly using dancers from Russia and the Baltic states. In 2002 Brennan opened the Movie Star Cafe, a lap dancing club in Belfast, with dancers from Belfast and England. The Belfast club was officially opened as a restaurant to circumvent Northern Ireland&#x27;s licensing laws. The opening of the club was opposed by Rev. David McIlveen, a minister in the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, and the club was often picketed by protesters from the church and women&#x27;s groups. In 2003 councillors from Belfast City Council expressed their intention to refuse the renewal of the club&#x27;s licence, and the club closed in November 2003 with debts of over £300,000. Brennan&#x27;s nightclub in Dundalk remained open.

A few years later Northern Ireland businessman Lawrence John organised lap dancing at a Hooters bar, followed by a clandestine lap dancing club in Belfast in 2007. It was the subject of a report on the BBC Northern Ireland TV programme Spotlight in 2008 alleging that simulated lesbian sex shows took place on the premises.

===United States===
Some jurisdictions in the United States outlaw lap dances and enforce a minimum distance between dancer and patron. In Seattle, one such minimum distance ordinance was overturned by public referendum in November 2006.

Also in 2006, concerned about reports of sexual assault and illegal stage fees, San Francisco&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women recommended a ban on private rooms and booths at adult clubs in the city. However, a majority of dancers at the Commission&#x27;s meetings and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors&#x27; meetings protested against these efforts, fearing for their income and claiming that these rooms were safer than other venues. As a result, the Commission&#x27;s proposed ban was not adopted by the city.

In February 2010, the Detroit City Council voted to ban lap dances in VIP rooms. However, across from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario in Canada, lap dancing remained legal, even where alcohol was served, and sex clubs were also legal in Windsor.

In 2012, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that lap dances were not an art form and are subject to sales tax.

==Labor issues and job conditions==

The economic position of lap dancers, as employees of the clubs, has also changed. Over time, most strip clubs have stopped paying wages to the dancers. Stage dancing became a showcase to advertise the bodies of the dancers, whose money came from the tips or standard charges, depending on the club, that the patrons gave them for lap dancing. In the majority of clubs, dancers are simply charged a percentage of their nightly takings. However, the latest development in many countries, including Great Britain, the United States and Canada, is that many clubs charge dancers a &quot;stage fee&quot; or &quot;tip-out&quot;, which is an amount that a dancer needs to pay a club (usually in advance) in order to work on a given night, per shift. The lapdancers are expected to tip the &quot;house mothers&quot; (women who work in a strip club to support and assist the dancers) and DJs.

Given that dancers are basically paying for the privilege to be at a club, some clubs allow as many dancers as possible to appear on any given night, increasing competition among the dancers. Also, the vast majority of clubs will not waive this charge if a night happens to be slow. Consequently, the dancer either leaves her shift without any profit or builds a debt to the club.

Concerns raised by lapdancers include patrons stalking them, exposing their penis, ejaculating in their pants, attempting to have sex with the dancers without their consent, or committing sexual assault.
Some lapdance clubs have CCTV cameras in the &quot;champagne rooms&quot; for the safety of the dancers. Dancer Mary Jane says that when a lapdancer wishes to have paid sexual activities with a client, she tips the management, waitresses, and DJ to &quot;turn a blind eye&quot; to these sexual activities.

In the U.S., most clubs treat dancers as independent contractors, thereby avoiding the need to pay minimum wages, overtime pay, income taxes and other benefits required by law. This status has repeatedly been challenged by some dancers. While labor commissions and the courts have, for the most part, ruled that exotic dancers are employees and deserving of reimbursement for and stage fees, some court decisions have decided that an exotic dancer can be classified as an independent contractor. In June 2006, in &quot;Tracy Buel v. Chowder House (dba The Hungry I)&quot; an appellate court of California&#x27;s first district ruled that dancer Tracy Buel, also known as &quot;Daisy Anarchy&quot;, was correctly classified as an independent contractor and that &quot;Buel shall pay defendants’ costs on appeal&quot;. A publication called the California Employment Law Letter described the case as follows: &quot;The dancer based her suit on the fact that she was an employee of the nightclub rather than an independent contractor. The appellate court, however, after applying a 10-factor test, upheld the jury&#x27;s verdict in favor of the nightclub and its owners and found that the evidence weighed in favor of classifying the dancer as an independent contractor rather than an employee.&quot;

In an article written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which was partly based on an interview with an anonymous former stripper, journalist Rachel Bell claimed that &quot;[r]esearch shows that the majority of women become lap-dancers through poverty and lack of choice,&quot; and that &quot;academic research has linked lap-dancing to trafficking, prostitution and an increase in male sexual violence against both the women who work in the clubs and those who live and work in their vicinity.&quot; For example, a &quot;recent conference in Ireland highlighted the use of lap-dance clubs by human traffickers as a tool for grooming women into prostitution; the clubs also normalise the idea of paying for sexual services.&quot; &quot;[R]esearch on strip clubs in the US found that all dancers had suffered verbal harassment and physical and sexual abuse while at work; all had been propositioned for prostitution; and three-quarters had been stalked by men associated with the club.&quot;

However, these claims have been disputed by some studies. A paper published in 2020 which examined the relationship between strip clubs and rates of sexual violence and violent crime in the United States concluded that &quot;strip clubs were significantly associated with violent crime, but not with&quot; sexual violence.

Another analysis, conducted by the University of Leeds, &quot;which involved interviews with 300 dancers, found there was a high level of job satisfaction and all had some qualifications&quot;, while another concluded that &quot;that there are other motivations to stripping beside just economic&quot;, and that &quot;[n]on-monetary motivations were significantly important ... and were discussed more than monetary motivations&quot; by those who were examined. The overwhelming majority of those surveyed were satisfied with their work, because they got to choose their own hours, got paid instantly, got more money than in other available jobs, and had the opportunity to combine &quot;fun and work&quot; (e.g., socializing with other dancers and patrons). They also stated that &quot;groups hostile toward stripping disregard their right to free speech and occupational choice, dismiss their ability to think for themselves, and are patronizing and condescending&quot;. At the same time, the same study revealed various disadvantages to lap dancing work, such as uncertainty regarding earnings, having to keep their job secret from friends and family, and occasionally having to face rude and abusive customers. Additionally, while most felt safe, almost half of the dancers interviewed had faced frequent verbal harassment and unwanted touching from patrons. Another issue raised by the dancers was their lack of labour rights in the workplace and high overhead costs – house fees (or stage fees), commissions, fines (whether paid directly to the club&#x27;s management or not), and tipping out (or paying a portion of their income) to DJs and bouncers.

Critics of lap dancing choose to describe it as a type of sex work, because, in their opinion, &quot;it is difficult to discern between the performance of erotic dance and prostitution.&quot; However, others contend that it is a misnomer to call a &quot;lap dancer&quot; a &quot;sex worker&quot;, because no sexual act is technically performed during a typical lap dance. Club owners in the UK argue that lap dancing should not be labelled as sex work. On the other hand, one lapdancer, Mary Jane, told a reporter that she and other lapdancers negotiate “extras&quot; (nicknamed the &quot;secret menu&quot;) with clients, such as a &quot;hand job&quot; (male masturbation) or sexual intercourse, for additional payment.

In 2007, based on statistics from eighteen dancers over a period of 60 days, it was noted that female lap dancers earned the highest tips around the time of ovulation, during the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle and the lowest tips during menstruation; the average difference in earning between those two times amounted to about $30 per hour. Women on the pill earned overall less than those not on the pill. The results were interpreted as evidence of estrus in humans: females apparently advertise their fertility status to males in some manner. This finding earned its authors the 2008 Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prize given for unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research) in Economics.

===Level of contact===
Establishments that offer lap dancing, and the lap dancers themselves, are sometimes rated regarding &quot;mileage.&quot; It refers to the amount of contact between dancer and patron during the performance. Every jurisdiction has its own laws regarding such contact, but enforcement of these laws is sporadic. Ultimately, it comes down to what the club and the dancer will allow.

Nevada, and especially Las Vegas, have established very lenient laws regarding what contact is allowed during a lap dance. Patrons may legally touch the dancer anywhere she will permit, excluding the genitals. This has led to a pricing strategy in some all-nude strip clubs, in which a standard lap dance is considered to be just topless with no contact, but can be upgraded to include full nudity or touching with additional payment.

<text>A table is an arrangement of information or data, typically in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs, and many other places. The precise conventions and terminology for describing tables vary depending on the context. Further, tables differ significantly in variety, structure, flexibility, notation, representation and use. Information or data conveyed in table form is said to be in tabular format (). In books and technical articles, tables are typically presented apart from the main text in numbered and captioned floating blocks.

== Basic description ==
A table consists of an ordered arrangement of rows and columns. This is a simplified description of the most basic kind of table. Certain considerations follow from this simplified description:

* the term row has several common synonyms (e.g., record, k-tuple, n-tuple, vector);
* the term column has several common synonyms (e.g., field, parameter, property, attribute, stanchion);
* a column is usually identified by a name;
* a column name can consist of a word, phrase or a numerical index;
* the intersection of a row and a column is called a cell.

The elements of a table may be grouped, segmented, or arranged in many different ways, and even nested recursively. Additionally, a table may include metadata, annotations, a header, a footer or other ancillary features.

=== Simple table ===
The following illustrates a simple table with four columns and nine rows. The first row is not counted, because it is only used to display the column names. This is called a &quot;header row&quot;.

=== Multi-dimensional table ===
The concept of dimension is also a part of basic terminology. Any &quot;simple&quot; table can be represented as a &quot;multi-dimensional&quot;
table by normalizing the data values into ordered hierarchies. A common example of such a table is a multiplication table.

In multi-dimensional tables, each cell in the body of the table (and the value of that cell) relates to the values at the beginnings of the column (i.e. the header), the row, and other structures in more complex tables. This is an injective relation: each combination of the values of the headers row (row 0, for lack of a better term) and the headers column (column 0 for lack of a better term) is related to a unique cell in
the table:

* Column 1 and row 1 will only correspond to cell (1,1);
* Column 1 and row 2 will only correspond to cell (2,1) etc.

The first column often presents information dimension description by which the rest of the table is navigated. This column is called &quot;stub column&quot;. Tables may contain three or multiple dimensions and can be classified by the number of dimensions. Multi-dimensional tables may have super-rows - rows that describe additional dimensions for the rows that are presented below that row and are usually grouped in a tree-like structure. This structure is typically visually presented with an appropriate number of white spaces in front of each stub&#x27;s label.

In literature tables often present numerical values, cumulative statistics, categorical values, and at times parallel descriptions in form of text. They can condense large amount of information to a limited space and therefore they are popular in scientific literature in many fields of study.
==Generic representation==
As a communication tool, a table allows a form of generalization of information from an unlimited number of different social or scientific contexts. It provides a familiar way to convey information that might otherwise not be obvious or readily understood.

For example, in the following diagram, two alternate representations of the same information are presented side by side. On the left is the NFPA 704 standard &quot;fire diamond&quot; with example values indicated and on the right is a simple table displaying the same values, along with additional information. Both representations convey essentially the same information, but the tabular representation is arguably more comprehensible to someone who is not familiar with the NFPA 704 standard. The tabular representation may not, however, be ideal for every circumstance (for example because of space limitations, or safety reasons).
==Specific uses==
There are several specific situations in which tables are routinely used as a matter of custom or formal convention.

===Publishing===
* Cross-reference (Table of contents)

===Mathematics===

* Arithmetic (Multiplication table)
* Logic (Truth table)

===Natural sciences===
* Chemistry (Periodic table)
* Oceanography (tide table)

===Information technology===
====Software applications====
Modern software applications give users the ability to generate, format, and edit tables and tabular data for a wide variety of uses, for example:
*word processing applications;
*spreadsheet applications;
*presentation software;
*tables specified in HTML or another markup language

==== Software development ====
Tables have uses in software development for both high-level specification and low-level implementation.
Usage in software specification can encompass ad hoc inclusion of simple decision tables in textual documents through to the use of tabular specification methodologies, examples of which include Software Cost Reduction and Statestep.
Proponents of tabular techniques, among whom David Parnas is prominent, emphasize their understandability, as well as the quality and cost advantages of a format allowing systematic inspection, while corresponding shortcomings experienced with a graphical notation were cited in motivating the development of at least two tabular approaches.

At a programming level, software may be implemented using constructs generally represented or understood as tabular, whether to store data (perhaps to memoize earlier results), for example, in arrays or hash tables, or control tables determining the flow of program execution in response to various events or inputs.

==== Databases ====
Database systems often store data in structures called tables; in which columns are data fields and rows represent data records.

==Historical relationship to furniture==
In medieval counting houses, the tables were covered with a piece of checkered cloth, to count money.&quot;Exchequer&quot; is an archaic term for the English institution which accounted for money owed to the monarch. Thus the checkerboard tables of stacks of coins are a concrete realization of this information.

<text>Fuzzball routers were the first modern routers on the Internet. They were DEC PDP-11 computers (usually LSI-11 personal workstations) loaded with the Fuzzball software written by David L. Mills (of the University of Delaware). The name &quot;Fuzzball&quot; was the colloquialism for Mills&#x27;s routing software. The software evolved from the Distributed Computer Network (DCN) that started at the University of Maryland in 1973. It acquired the nickname sometime after it was rewritten in 1977.

Six Fuzzball routers provided the routing backbone of the first 56 kbit/s NSFNET, allowing the testing of many of the Internet&#x27;s first protocols. It allowed the development of the first TCP/IP routing protocols, and the Network Time Protocol. They were the first routers to implement key refinements to TCP/IP such as variable-length subnet masks.

<text>The 35th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 24, 1993 and recognized accomplishments by musicians from the previous year. The nominations were announced on January 7, 1993.

<doc id="337870" wikidata="Q1351030" url="?curid=337870" title="Court dress">
<text>Court dress comprises the style of clothes and other attire prescribed for members of courts of law. Depending on the country and jurisdiction&#x27;s traditions, members of the court (judges, magistrates, and so on) may wear formal robes, gowns, collars, or wigs. Within a certain country and court setting, there may be many times when the full formal dress is not used. Examples in the UK include many courts and tribunals including the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and sometimes trials involving children.

==Commonwealth countries==
===United Kingdom===
====The Supreme Court====

Members of the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords (or &quot;Law Lords&quot;) and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council never wore court dress (although advocates appearing before them did). Instead, they were dressed in ordinary business clothing in accordance with the fashion of their time. Since the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009, the Justices of that court have retained the Law Lords&#x27; tradition of sitting unrobed. On ceremonial occasions they wear a robe of black damask embellished with gold with the badge of the Supreme Court embroidered at the yoke.

In 2011, the Supreme Court provided that counsel may jointly agree to dispense with some or all of the traditional elements of court dress at sittings. Thus, at many sittings since then, all justices and counsel present have been attired in ordinary business suits.

===England and Wales===
====Where court dress is worn====
Court dress is worn at hearings in open court in many sittings of Senior Courts of England and Wales and in the County Court. It is not worn in the Technology and Construction Court, nor in the Commercial Court. Further, in any court formal dress may be dispensed with at the option of the judge, e.g. in very hot weather, and invariably where it may intimidate children, e.g., in the Family Division and at the trials of minors.

Court dress is not worn at hearings in chambers or in magistrates&#x27; courts, nor in tribunals.

====Reform====
In July 2007, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, announced that changes would be made to court working dress in the English and Welsh courts. The reforms were due to take effect on 1 January 2008; however, following reports of strong opposition to the proposed changes, they were delayed, eventually taking effect in autumn 2008. The new robes for judges were designed by Betty Jackson and unveiled in May 2008, although a survey of judges published in March 2009 revealed substantial opposition to the new designs, as well as widespread annoyance at the lack of consultation prior to the change.

The Chairman of the Bar announced in April 2008 that, as a result of a survey of the profession, the Bar would recommend that advocates should retain their existing formal robes (including wigs) in all cases, civil and criminal, with possible exceptions in the County Court. In a letter to the profession, he said (in part):

For the most part, the changes only affect what is worn by judges in civil courts, who now wear a simplified robe and no wig. Dress worn in criminal courts remains largely unchanged. The changes have been reflected in the dress allowances made to judges (while the one-off cost of supplying the new civil gown was estimated at about £200,000, annual savings in the region of £300,000 were projected).

====Advocates====

English and Welsh advocates (whether barristers, solicitors or other authorised lawyers such as chartered legal executive advocates with the appropriate right of audience) who appear before a judge who is robed must themselves be robed.

All male advocates wear a white stiff wing collar with bands (two strips of cotton about hanging down the front of the neck). They also wear either a dark double-breasted suit (or with waistcoat if single-breasted) or a black coat and waistcoat and black or grey morning dress striped trousers (black lounge suit). The black coat and waistcoat can be combined into a single garment, which is simply a waistcoat with sleeves, known as a bar jacket or court waistcoat. Female advocates also wear a dark suit, but often wear bands attached to a collarette rather than a wing collar.

====Junior barristers====
Junior barristers wear an open-fronted black gown with open sleeves, gathered and decorated with buttons and ribbons, and a gathered yoke, over a black or dark suit, hence the archaic term &quot;stuffgownsman&quot; for juniors. In addition, barristers wear a short horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back.

====Solicitors====
Solicitors wear the same wing collar with bands, or collarette, as barristers. Their gowns are of a slightly different style, with a square collar and without gathered sleeves. By virtue of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction at I.1.1 (as amended by Practice Direction (Court Dress) (No4) [2008] 1 WLR 257), &quot;Solicitors and other advocates authorised under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ... may wear short wigs in circumstances where they would be worn by King&#x27;s Counsel or junior counsel.&quot; Other qualified advocates, such as chartered legal executive advocates, will wear the same attire as a solicitor.

===== King&#x27;s Counsel =====

Barristers or solicitors who have been appointed King&#x27;s Counsel (&quot;KCs&quot;) wear a silk gown with a flap collar and long closed sleeves (the arm opening is half-way up the sleeve). For this reason, barristers who are appointed King&#x27;s Counsel are said to have &quot;taken silk&quot;, and KCs themselves are colloquially called &quot;silks&quot;. The KC&#x27;s black coat, known as a court coat, is cut like 18th-century court dress and the sleeve of the KC&#x27;s court coat or bar jacket has a turned back cuff with three buttons across. On special ceremonial occasions (such as the opening of the legal year), KCs wear (in addition to their court coat, waistcoat and silk gown) a long wig, black breeches, silk stockings and buckled shoes, lace cuffs and a lace jabot instead of bands.

====Judges====
Judicial robes have always exhibited variety depending on the status of the judge, the type of court and other considerations. In addition to robes, judges have generally worn a short bench wig when working in court (reserving the long wig for ceremonial occasions) and a wing collar and bands at the neck.

All judges in criminal cases continue to wear these traditional forms of dress, which are described in more detail below. Judges in civil and family cases, however, have since 2008 worn a new design of working robe with no wig, collar or bands; this plain, dark, zipped gown (of &#x27;midnight blue gabardine with facings in navy blue velvet&#x27;) is worn over an ordinary business suit and tie. The status of the wearer is indicated by a pair of different colored tabs below the collar: Appeal Court judges wear gold tabs, High Court judges wear red tabs, Masters and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges of the High Court wear pink, and District judges wear blue. It was originally envisaged that Circuit judges sitting in the High Court would likewise adopt the new-style robe with purple tabs, but they opted to retain their violet robe as worn in the County Court.

On special ceremonial occasions (such as the opening of the legal year) more elaborate forms of traditional dress are worn, by civil and criminal judges alike.

====The Lord Chief Justice====

The Lord Chief Justice, when robed, dresses like a High Court Judge (see below) with the distinction of a train to his scarlet robe. On ceremonial occasions he wears the scarlet and fur hood and mantle, and in addition a gold chain of office in the form of a collar of esses. (Summer robes, with grey silk in place of the fur, were formerly routinely worn for part of the year and are still used on occasion.)

====Lords Justices of Appeal====
Judges in the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, wear the same black silk gown and court coat as KCs, together with the short bench wig. Judges of the Civil Division did likewise until 2008, but they now wear the new-style robe.

The use of plain black gowns in the Court of Appeal dates from the origin of the Court in the 1870s, when it was populated by Chancery judges who were accustomed to this form of dress.

On ceremonial occasions, all Judges of the Court of Appeal wear the full-bottomed wig, together with a black silk damask gown, trained and heavily embellished with gold embroidery, over court coat, lace cuffs and jabot, black breeches, stockings and buckled shoes.

====High Court Judges====

On ceremonial occasions, all High Court judges wear the traditional full-bottom wig and the furred scarlet robe (as described below, with scarf, girdle, and tippet), with a matching hood and mantle in addition. Underneath, breeches are worn with stockings and buckled shoes. The judicial black cap is carried.

King&#x27;s Bench Division: When dealing with first-instance criminal business a High Court judge of the King&#x27;s Bench Division wears a scarlet robe with fur facings, a black scarf and girdle (waistband), and a scarlet &quot;casting-hood&quot; (tippet) worn over the shoulder. In addition, the judge wears a wing collar, bands, and a short wig. (Prior to 2008 this robe was only worn in the winter months; in summer months a different scarlet robe was worn, with grey silk facings in place of the fur. The &quot;summer&quot; robe is no longer routinely provided, but its use is still permitted in court.)

In civil cases, High Court judges wear the new-style robe with red tabs at the collar, and no wig, collar, or bands. Before 2008, these judges wore: in winter a black robe faced with fur, a black scarf and girdle, and a scarlet tippet; and in summer a violet robe faced with silk, with the black scarf and girdle and scarlet tippet.

On red letter days (which include the Sovereign&#x27;s birthday and certain saints&#x27; days), all judges of the King&#x27;s Bench Division wear their scarlet robes.

Chancery and Family Divisions: Until 2008, when working in court, judges in the Family and Chancery divisions of the courts wore the same black silk gown and court coat or bar jacket as KCs. Since autumn 2008 they too (if robed) have worn the new design of robe in court.

High Court Masters and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges: Masters (in both the King&#x27;s Bench Division and Chancery Division) and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges (in the Chancery Division) formerly wore black gowns, white collar and bands, with short wigs, when sitting in open court. Since 2008 they wear the new design of civil robe with pink tabs at the neck and no longer wear wigs. Ceremonially, they wear a black court court, waistcoat, and gown, with black breeches, stockings, buckled shoes, white lace jabot and cuffs, and a long wig, similar to the ceremonial costume of King&#x27;s Counsel.

===== Circuit judges =====

Circuit judges (in the County Courts or the Crown Court) wear a violet robe with lilac facings, introduced in 1919. As well as a girdle, the judges wear a tippet (sash) over the left shoulder - lilac when dealing with civil business and red when dealing with crime. Since autumn 2008, circuit judges in the County Court have not worn wigs, wing collars or bands; however, circuit judges in the Crown Court retain the wig, wing collars and bands.

Prior to introduction of the violet robe, Circuit judges usually wore a plain black gown and short wig; this older tradition has been retained by the Central Criminal Court.

On ceremonial occasions, circuit judges in addition to their violet robes wear a matching hood, long wig, black breeches, stockings and buckled shoes, and a lace jabot instead of bands.

===== District judges =====

Since autumn 2008, district judges in the county courts have worn the new-style robe, with the rank of district judge indicated by blue tabs on the facings of the robe by the collar. On ceremonial occasions, district judges wear their ordinary robe together with a short, bar wig.

District judges (magistrates&#x27; courts) continue to sit without robes.

====Court officers====
Court clerks in the Crown Court, if a High Court judge is sitting, wear wig, black gown, wing collar (or collarette) and bands; if a circuit judge is sitting they wear the same outfit without a wig.

Plain business dress is worn in the County Court.

Court ushers generally wear a simple black gown over plain business dress.

===Scotland===
Scottish court dress is very similar to English court dress, with notable differences. Most Scottish courts have eliminated legal dress for civil business and kept it for criminal proceedings.

Lawyers in Scotland are either advocates or solicitors. Male advocates wear tail coats under their gowns, and wear white bow ties instead of bands. Female advocates wear dark formal clothing under their gowns but no neckwear. Advocates who have become KCs or judges wear long scarf-like ties (known as falls) instead of bands.

Advocates now wear business dress, such as a dark suit, unless the court is dealing with a criminal matter, breach of interdict or contempt of court or the sheriff or judge has directed court dress. Court dress is routinely no longer used in the Inner and Outer House, which only hear civil cases. Business dress in court must include a necktie for male advocates.

Business in the lower Scottish courts is routinely conducted by a solicitor, unlike the English jurisdictions, where an advocate (barrister) will often have to be instructed. Solicitors in court wear a court gown over business dress; they do not use the advocate&#x27;s wig or formal dress. This includes solicitor-advocates who have attained higher rights of audience.

Scottish judicial robes are very different from English ones. Senators of the College of Justice are Scotland&#x27;s senior judges; they sit in both the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary (Scotland&#x27;s top criminal court). Judicial robes in the Court of Session are dark red, faced with red crosses (a stylised representation of what were once ribbons used to fasten the gown). Judicial robes in the High Court of Justiciary are predominantly white and red, faced with red crosses over the white. The white and red robe of the Lord Justice Clerk is differentiated by many small perforations in the white satin, through which the red cloth shows giving an ermine-like impression. The Lord Justice General wears a red robe and hood (without crosses) edged in ermine (black-spotted white fur). Senators sitting in the supreme Scottish civil court, the Court of Session, now routinely wear business dress.

Sheriffs (who preside over Sheriff Courts) wear the black gowns which they formerly used in practice (silk gowns for KCs; stuff gowns for advocates and solicitor-advocates), with falls in place of the bow-tie. Most sheriffdoms have now replaced court dress with business dress for civil business, following the lead of the supreme courts. Sheriffs and advocates in those courts are not required to wear a gown, formal dress or wig and solicitors are not required to wear a gown, provided that evidence is not being taken from a witness or the sheriff has not specially directed the wearing of court dress for a particular matter.

===Australia===

In Australia, court dress varies according to the jurisdiction. Judges in all Australian courts will not usually wear court dress for procedural or chambers proceedings.

In the High Court of Australia, justices wear plain black robes with zippered fronts over normal attire. The robes are similar in appearance to those worn by Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, although they are more elaborately tailored. These robes have been worn since 1988, when the High Court abandoned the previous court dress of black silk robes, bar jackets, jabots or bands and full-bottomed wigs and lace cuffs on formal occasions and bench wigs for ordinary business attire. In the High Court of Australia, barristers wear the same dress as is required by the Supreme Court in their jurisdiction.

In the Federal Court of Australia, judges no longer wear traditional court dress, but wear black wool robes with a black trim for &#x27;first instance&#x27; work, and black wool robes with a red trim for appeal cases. These robes were adopted in 1997 and were designed by Bill Haycock. The robes have seven horizontal tucks or &quot;ombres&quot; on one side, representing the six Australian States and the territories. They also serve to symbolise Australia&#x27;s federal constitution and the federal jurisdiction of the Court. The robes also include a vertical band of black silk made up of seven equal parts, also symbolizing Australia&#x27;s federal system and equality before the law. For a matter heard in the Federal Court of Australia, barristers robe (but without a wig) if it is the usual practice to robe in the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which the matter is being heard.

Judges and judicial registrars of the Family Court of Australia wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket with either bands or a jabot and a bench wig. On formal occasions, judges wear full-bottomed wigs.

Judges of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia wear a plain black gown in court without a wig. Prior to 2010, counsel did not robe before the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Barristers are now expected to robe for most hearings, but not for interlocutory or interim matters. Wigs are not worn on any occasion.

Judges of the supreme courts of the states and territories of Australia wear court dress similar to that worn by judges of the High Court of England and Wales. On formal occasions, judges wear red scarlet robe with white fur facings, bands or a jabot, a black scarf and girdle and a scarlet casting-hood, with a full-bottomed wig. Unlike judges in the United Kingdom, judges in Australia never wear breeches, hose and buckled shoes. When sitting in criminal proceedings, judges wear scarlet robes with grey silk facings, bands or a jabot and a bench wig. When sitting in appeal or in civil proceedings, judges and masters wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket with either bands or a jabot and a bench wig. In some jurisdictions, the wearing of wigs has been abandoned for other than formal occasions.

Judges of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales and judges sitting in the Workers&#x27; Compensation Court of NSW and the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales wear the same court dress as a judge of the Supreme Court sitting civilly.

Judges of the district or county courts of the states of Australia wear court dress similar to that worn by judges of the County Court of England and Wales.

Stipendiary Magistrates and justices of the peace do not robe, other than in NSW where they have worn a black robe over normal business attire since 2005.

Barristers in all Australian jurisdictions, when required to do so, wear court dress similar to that worn in the United Kingdom. King&#x27;s Counsel or Senior Counsel wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket, bands or a jabot and a horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back. On formal occasions, they wear full-bottomed wigs. In addition Victorian Senior Counsel wear a black rosette hanging from the back of their gown. Junior Counsel wear an open-fronted black stuff gown with open sleeves and a gathered yoke, and otherwise wear the same outfit as Senior Counsel (other than full-bottomed wigs). Counsel usually wear dark trousers or striped trousers, or a dark skirt for female barristers. Barristers will not usually robe for procedural hearings (which are called &#x27;directions hearings&#x27; in South Australia).

Solicitors, in those jurisdictions where the legal profession is not fused (such as New South Wales and Queensland) do not robe when appearing in court, even before superior courts. In those States and Territories with fused professions, solicitors robe in situations where barristers would normally wear robes.

In 2010, the Chief Justice of Western Australia, Wayne Martin, introduced major reforms for Western Australian Courts; in the District Court, wigs were abolished for both lawyers and judges. District Court judges and lawyers maintained their robes. In the Supreme Court Criminal Jurisdiction, traditional judges&#x27; red robes were replaced with American-style plain black robes; this also applied to all appeal courts. Wigs were abolished in all Supreme Courts for both judges and lawyers. This change was met with sadness by some members of the legal fraternity in the state, as it ended over 180 years of tradition in Western Australia.

In Victoria, the Chief Justice of Victoria has the power to make decisions about the attire of judges in courts, while decisions about what barristers wear are a matter for the Victorian Bar. In April 2016, the Chief Justice of Victoria Marilyn Warren, issued an edict that Victorian Supreme Court judges will no longer wear wigs from May 1 that year. Since then, use of wigs has been declining in Victorian courts; as of August 2021, only 13 out of 70 County Court judges continue to wear wigs, with barristers only wearing wigs when the judge does.

===Canada===

In Canada, court dress is identical to that previously (pre-2008) in use in England, except that wigs are not worn. Wigs were worn in early courts but phased out beginning in the mid-19th century with last holdouts British Columbia (1905) and Newfoundland and Labrador (upon joining Canada in 1949)). Bar jackets are worn under the gown, though KCs and judges have more elaborate cuffs than other lawyers. Barristers are required to gown for the Courts of Appeal and Superior-level courts of the provinces and territories, unless appearing on applications in chambers, on some family court matters, in Small Claims Court or before Masters.

The Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada at the general procedure level require barristers to gown. As well, gowns are required at the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. The donning of business attire is acceptable by barristers appearing in chambers and in inferior (puisne) provincial and territorial courts; court dress is also permitted, though rarely worn, with the exception of Quebec where gowns are standard practice in the Court of Quebec. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada wear scarlet robes with white fur trim on ceremonial occasions together with black tricorne hats; however, they wear black gowns with white neck band tabs when hearing cases. Judges of all other federal and provincial courts wear black gowns, sometimes adorned with various sashes and crests which depend on the level of court and the province in which the case is heard. All Canadian judges also wear black court waistcoats with white collar and tabs.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, the courts have upheld the traditions of wearing black and white. All judges and advocates, equally, wear a black suit, black trousers, black shoes, white shirt, a white neck band, and a black gown. This applies to all the courts of Cyprus. The regulations in the Cypriot courts come from the past that Cyprus had as a British Colony.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the courts have upheld (the British era) traditions of wearing black and white.

Male judges wear white shirts and trousers with a white neck band and a black coat, whilst female judges normally choose to wear the traditional sari, and pair it with a white neck band and a black coat.

Male lawyers are required to wear either:
* A black buttoned up coat, chapkan, achkan, black sherwani and white bands with Advocates&#x27; gowns
* A black open breast coat, white shirt, white collar, stiff or soft, and white bands with Advocates&#x27; gowns

In either case, they can wear long trousers (white, black striped or grey) or dhoti, but not jeans.

Female lawyers are required to wear either:
* Black full sleeve jacket or blouse, white collar stiff or soft, with white bands and Advocates&#x27; gowns; 
* White blouse, with or without collar, with white bands, a black open breast coat and Advocates&#x27; gowns; or 
* A sari or long skirt (white or black or any mellow or subdued colour without any print or design) or flare (white, black or black striped or grey) with white bands, a black coat and Advocates&#x27; gowns.
====Exemptions====
* In courts other than the Supreme Court, high courts, district courts, sessions courts or city civil courts, a black tie may be worn instead of bands.
* Wearing of an advocates&#x27; gown is optional except when appearing in the Supreme Court or in high courts.
* Except in the Supreme Court or High Courts, wearing of a black coat is not mandatory during summer.

====Other features====
* Neither the judges nor the lawyers wear wigs.
* Both judges and lawyers wear a long black robe termed as the &#x27;gown&#x27;. 
* Lawyers are supposed to wear a gown having the barrister&#x27;s pouch at the back. However, in certain courts, junior advocates do not have the pouch but have a flap instead (akin to a solicitor&#x27;s gown but with short sleeves). 
* Judges and senior advocates are distinguished by the extended sleeves on their gowns (i.e. they wear a traditional solicitor&#x27;s gown) and not necessarily the KC gown as the material is not always &#x27;silk&#x27; and may also be of stuff. 
* Judges and senior advocates are also distinguished by the different coat which is like a full sleeved vest or waistcoat.

===Malaysia===
Court dress in Malaysia is based on English court dress, with some modifications. Since the 1990s, judges no longer wear wigs but a songkok, wing collars and bands but instead wear a waterfall cravat with court coat and black silk gown. Ceremonial robes for judicial office-bearers are generally black with gold lace.

Counsel in Malaysia dress as English junior barristers do, but do not wear wigs. Prior to the 1980s, counsel serving in the government legal service wore wigs. Counsel in private practice have never done so. However, some counsels in East Malaysia still wear wigs as part of their court dress.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, court dress was simplified in 1996. District Court judges wear black American-style gowns in the Employment Court and District Court. Coroners wear a blue gown with a black yoke and black ribbon on the cuffs. High Court judges wear the KC&#x27;s gown over suits, while counsel are only required to wear black gowns for jury trials in the District Court, and all the time in the Employment Court, High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.

Wigs (for counsel) are only worn on ceremonial occasions such as when newly qualified barristers are called to the Bar. No gowns are ordinarily worn by the judges of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand or Supreme Court of New Zealand.

===Pakistan===
After independence, in Pakistan, the courts have continued to uphold the pre-independence (British-Raj traditions) of lawyers wearing white shirt and black coat, trouser and tie. However, in the 1980s, judges modified their dress to do away with wigs and allowed (optional) the usage of a black sherwani, a long traditional Pakistani coat worn over a white shalwar and qamiz (trousers and shirt).

In Pakistan, the dress code for lawyers or legal practitioners varies with the season. During the winter months, a formal black suit and tie are worn. During the hot summer months, white shirt and trousers and a white neck band may be worn. In addition, judges wear a black robe over their other garments. Wigs are no longer worn. Dress codes are rigorously enforced within the Superior Courts of the country.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the British tradition of court dress had been adopted and practised until reforms of the legal system took place in the 1970s, and much of the ceremonial and formal court dress worn by judges and lawyers was replaced with black business suits. However, the old traditions were revived in the 1980s with many elements of the traditional court dress being used today. Both judges and counsel dress in white and black, white shirt, black coat, tie and trousers for men and white sarees for women.

====Supreme Court Judges====
The Chief Judge and Judges of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka wear scarlet gowns when attending court. On ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court) they wear a scarlet gown, barrister&#x27;s bands, mantle and a long wig.

====Justices of Appeal====
The President and Judges of the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka wear black gowns when attending court. On ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court) they wear a black gown with purple borders, barrister&#x27;s bands, mantle and a long wig.

====Lower court Judges====
High Court and District Court judges wear black gowns. Magistrates do not wear gowns.

====President&#x27;s Counsels====
President&#x27;s Counsel&#x27;s court dress is similar to that of King&#x27;s Counsels. It includes a silk gown with a flap collar and long closed sleeves (the arm opening is half-way up the sleeve). Therefore, the term &quot;taken silk&quot; continues. On special ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court), PCs also wear a long wig.

====Attorneys====
Attorneys at law wear white and black when appearing in all courts. They must wear black robes when appearing in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court; it is optional in the lower courts. Male attorneys may wear black suits with white shirt, black tie and trousers or white national, while female attorneys may wear a white saree or dress.

====Court staff====
The court usher known as Court Mudliar wears a white uniform, as do court Arachies.

===Other Commonwealth realms===
Court dress in many jurisdictions with legal systems derived from England&#x27;s, including Caribbean and African countries, which have court dress identical to that in England and Wales.

==Other jurisdictions==
=== Brazil ===

Justices of the Supreme Federal Court wear a black robe, usually worn open. These robes are mandatory under article 16 of the Internal Regulations of the Supreme Federal Court and are made of satin. Similar robes are worn in other courts. Lawyers wear a robe when addressing judges.

=== China ===
Recent changes to Chinese courts have led to a more formal dress code. Business suits or black gowns (with a red stripe on the front) are replacing the military look of the Chinese court system.

Judges of the supreme court wear black robes with a red strip with buttons. The buttons are gold with the top button having the seal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Czech Republic ===
Legal professionals in court wear a black robe with coloured elements. The colour depends on the profession – purple (judges of common courts), red (state prosecutors) and blue (attorneys). Attorneys only wear robes in criminal proceedings and in all proceedings before the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court. Judges of these courts wear specific robes.

===Germany===

German court dress consists of a plain robe roughly similar to the ones worn in the United States, normally without any kind of scarf or separate collar. However, judges and prosecutors always wear white shirts and white neckties under their robes, as is customary for lawyers in criminal cases.

In German courts, court dress is worn by judges, public prosecutors, lawyers and court clerks. The design of the robe, which was established in Prussia in 1713 and has remained virtually unchanged ever since, allows the respective functions to be distinguished by the fabric trim on the collar and sleeves. For judges and public prosecutors, the trimming is made of velvet, for &quot;Amtsanwälte&quot; (lower-rank prosecutors) it is half-width velvet, for lawyers it is silk and for court clerks it is plain fabric.

The colour of judges&#x27; robes varies between different kinds of courts and branches of the judiciary. While at the Federal Court of Justice in civil and criminal matters dark red robes with dark red velvet linings are always worn, lower courts – which are under the jurisdiction of the German states – use black in civil and criminal matters. Other branches of the judiciary (labour, administrative and social) use different colours of judges&#x27; robes.

In addition to the robe, the court dress of judges, public prosecutors and lawyers also includes a hat, the outside of which is made of the same fabric as the respective robe trim. In practice, the hat is no longer worn in most courts, with the exception of the Federal Constitutional Court, where they are still worn by the judges.

While the colour of German judges&#x27; robes can vary, lawyers in all branches of the law nearly always wear black robes with silk trimmings while in court, with the exception of those admitted to the Federal Court of Justice Bar, in civil matters; these specially appointed attorneys in private practice also wear dark red robes with silk trimming.

The robes of lawyers and judges can be distinguished by the size and material of the lining. State prosecutors wear the same black robes as states&#x27; judges sitting in &quot;ordinary&quot; (criminal or civil) courts, while representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor General wear dark red robes like federal court judges.

At the Federal Constitutional Court, a different type of robe is used which is based on the historical court dress of the Italian town of Florence. The constitutional court judges wear scarlet satin robes with a very high neckline, and caps, combined with a white pleated jabot. Lawyers appearing before the Constitutional Court wear their accustomed robes, i.e. black or dark red.

===Hong Kong===
Under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle, Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction. Court dress in Hong Kong practically remains unchanged from its British administration era and is similar to court dress in England and Wales. English legal traditions are well preserved. Judges of the former Supreme Court of Hong Kong wore wigs; those of the present Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, however, do not wear wigs, but only gowns with lace jabot, similar to those worn on the International Court of Justice. 

Some judges wear wigs as part of the ceremonies during the ceremonial opening of the legal year in Hong Kong.

===Ireland===
====Judiciary====
The Irish Free State, established in 1922, continued largely with the courts and court system inherited from the United Kingdom, albeit pared down and shorn of some of its imperial grandeur. To fit with the reorganization of the courts, the judiciary all but abandoned the wearing of their former ceremonial costumes. Prior to Independence, the Lord Chancellor, Master of the Rolls and the Lords Justice of Appeal in Ireland would have worn full ceremonial dress identical to their English equivalents, viz. long black damask robes with wide bands of gold lace and ornaments. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Chief Baron (up to the extinction of the office on the retirement of Christopher Palles in 1916) and other &quot;puisne&quot; judges of the High Court would likewise have worn scarlet robes with ermine hood and ermine-trimmed mantle. Many fine examples of these robes can be seen in portraits of Irish judges in the King&#x27;s Inns.

Upon the passing of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922, the office of Lord Chancellor immediately became defunct. Then in 1924 the Court of Appeal was refashioned into the Supreme Court; the Lord Chief Justice became simply Chief Justice and head of the judiciary; and the Master of the Rolls was replaced with a President of the High Court. The judges of the new superior courts, including the Chief Justice and President, adopted for all occasions—ceremonial or otherwise—the ordinary working judicial dress of the austere type previously worn by members of the old Court of Appeal, that is, as Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986 originally read: Wigs are now optional for judges of the High Court.

Judges of the Circuit Court also wear similar costume, pursuant to Order 3 rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules, 2001. The prescribed dress of judges of the District Court (in Order 5 rule 1 of the District Court Rules, 1997) is the same, but does not include a wig.

Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts was amended in 2012, and now stipulates that:

This new uniform is worn without a wig, and the single white neck tab is more reminiscent of European style court dress.

This alteration to the dress of the Supreme Court has also been implemented in the Court of Appeal, the Circuit Court and the District Court. The &quot;double ribbon banding&quot; is coloured dark blue with gold trim for judges of the Court of Appeal, dark red for judges of the Circuit Court and blue for judges of the District Court. Judges of the Circuit Court appointed prior to October 2016 and judges of the District Court appointed prior to March 2017 may wear the older judicial dress if they so wish. The dress of judges of the High Court remains unchanged. Wigs remain optional in the traditional dress, but do not constitute part of the recently introduced dress.

====Counsel====
Barristers&#x27; dress in Ireland is almost unchanged since the pre-Independence era. Counsel may not exercise his right of audience unless he is properly attired. It is provided in Order 119 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as follows:

It may therefore be said that Irish barristers robe similarly to their English counterparts. Such robes are worn by barristers in all courts, including the District Court. Like King&#x27;s Counsel in England, Senior Counsel generally wear a short bar wig and black silk or poplin gown with flap collar and long, closed sleeves over a buttoned and broad-cuffed court coat. Their shirts will have a detachable stiff wing collar, worn with bands. Junior Counsel wear a short bar wig and black poplin or stuff bar gown (which has a gathered yoke and short, open sleeves) over a dark three-piece suit with similar wing collar and bands. While it is not unknown for female barristers to wear a blouse with separate bands much like male colleagues, more commonly they would wear a starched white all-in-one collarette or bib covering their neckline that approximates in looks to a tall Mandarin collar and bands.

Section 49 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, however, did abolish the requirement that barristers should wear wigs in court. To this extent only, the wording of the Rules of Court above is somewhat out of date. (All counsel still must wear a gown and bands etc.) By affording individual barristers a discretion to wear the forensic wig in court, the new rule defused what had become an increasingly bitter debate in the profession whether it was appropriate to cleave to anachronistic modes of dress - even as a traditional and undoubtedly recognizable uniform - and avoided a more drastic solution, such as the abandonment of wigs or gowns altogether. Accordingly, there is little contemporary call for reform of court dress in Ireland.

=====Call to the Bar=====
Junior counsel are called to the Bar in three sittings in the year, one in Hilary term, one Trinity term, and the other in Michaelmas term. This ceremony takes place in the Supreme Court. All new barristers habit themselves in full court working dress.

=====Call to the Inner Bar=====
Senior Counsel are appointed annually in the Call to the Inner Bar, a short ceremony in the Supreme Court towards the end of Michaelmas term. (Junior counsel are members of the Outer or Utter Bar.) On this occasion alone do the new Senior Counsel wear full-bottomed wigs, though with their working robes rather than with the breeches, stockings, patent court shoes and lace stock of former times. This is purely a matter of convention and is not, so it would seem, governed by any rule of court. Since 1922, the Chief Justice has presided over the ceremony in lieu of the departed Lord Chancellor. None has seen fit to alter the manner of the Call.

====Family law proceedings====
Judges and counsel are forbidden to wear wigs and gowns in proceedings in the District, Circuit and High Courts in respect of &quot;inter alia&quot; the following Acts:
* Legitimacy Declaration Act (Ireland) 1868
* Children Acts 1908 to 2001
* Adoption Acts 1952 to 1998
* Married Women&#x27;s Status Act 1957
* Guardianship of Infants Act 1964
* Family Home Protection Act 1976
* Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976
* Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act 1981

* Family Law Act 1981
* Status of Children Act 1987
* Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989
* Child Care Act 1991
* Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991
* Family Law Act 1995
* Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996
* Domestic Violence Act 1996
It is arguable that the Oireachtas intended the ban on &quot;wigs and gowns&quot; should be read liberally to mean that judges and barristers should appear in ordinary suits in these cases. In practice, a literal interpretation of the rule has been preferred. Judges and counsel do not wear either wig or gown in the family courts but sometimes don the court coat (if applicable) and a wing collar and bands nonetheless, in part so that they can be distinguished from other court personnel.

According to the Law Reform Commission, the purpose of not wearing wigs and gowns is to ensure that such proceedings are &quot;as informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice.&quot;

Full court working dress remains worn in the Supreme Court in any proceedings, including those under the foregoing statutes.

====Sittings outside the law terms====
The Rules of Court oblige judges and barristers to wear court dress only &quot;during the sittings&quot; that is, during the four law terms of Michaelmas, Hilary, Easter and Trinity. In any hearing during the vacations, judges and counsel wear ordinary suits.

====Solicitors====
By virtue of Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, all solicitors have full rights of audience in the superior courts of Ireland. When appearing as advocates, they wear ordinary suits and, unlike in England, are not required to wear gowns.

=== Israel ===

Both Israeli judges and lawyers (while appearing in a court higher than the magistrate (&#x27;shalom&#x27;) level) wear black robes, generally worn open to show a white shirt, black necktie, and either black or dark blue trousers or skirts (optional for women), and jackets in the winter. The robes and neckties may bear the logo of the Israel Bar Association. (Out of court, many lawyers will wear a Bar Association pin in their jacket lapel.) While the practice of lawyers wearing court dress is a legacy of the British Mandate that immediately preceded Israeli independence, the relatively simple outfit (and lack of wigs) shows American influence; both nations&#x27; systems of law have similarly influenced Israel&#x27;s.

=== Italy ===
In Italy judges, prosecutors and lawyers wear black robes in higher courts or in criminal cases. Judges and prosecutors wear red, ermine-lined robes with golden striped hats on solemn occasions such as the opening of the judicial year.

=== Netherlands and Belgium ===
In the Netherlands and Belgium, judges, lawyers and prosecutors dress identically in the form of a black robe and a white band. This is a symbolic act, as it is meant to convey the idea that the judge is merely the representative of Dutch or Belgian law, rather than an elevated individual with the power of sentencing people. This idea finds its origins in the time of the French Revolution. However, there are some slight differences between the judge and the lawyer. The judge wears a black robe, with silk ties on the sleeves and on the closure of the robe. Lawyers just wear a simple black robe. The higher the rank in court, the fancier the robe becomes; the members of the Dutch &#x27;Hoge Raad&#x27; (High Council) wear a velvet black robe with ermine ties. In Belgium, the ceremonial robes of the judges in the courts of appeal, the courts of labour and the Court of Cassation use the colour red in addition to black. Both countries have specific and strict provisions and regulations on dress in court. In the Netherlands, this is statuted by the royal decree of 22 December 1997, in which both titulars and dressing rules are stipulated. The official Belgian court dresses are laid down in the royal decree of 22 July 1970.

Previously, Dutch judges shared no common dress as the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic, as the Netherlands were highly decentralised with only provincial and urban law and no federal law. Hence judges would dress as was the tradition in their own cities or towns.

===Norway===
In Norway all court officers wear robes according to what type of court, a black wool robe with a scarlet velvet lapels and cuffs for judges in the Supreme court, a black wool robe with a black velvet lapels and cuffs for judges in Appellate court and Municipal court.
Advocates and prosecutors wear a black wool robe with a black silk lapels and cuffs. Court scribes (court reporters) wear a black lapel-less wool robe with no adornment on the cuffs. Prosecutors who are police advocates (police prosecutors) can wear their police uniform with their rank insignia on their shoulders. Bailiffs wear a police-like uniform. There are no special collars, wigs or hats.

The judge in municipal court, as well as the senior judge in appellate court can decide that no one wears robes, on a case to case basis, but this happens only in non- air conditioned courtrooms on hot summer days.

Lay judges (2 in municipal court, and 5 in appellate court) wear no special clothing.

=== Poland ===
==== Court dress ====

Under Polish law all legal professionals taking part in court proceedings, which includes members of the adjudicating panel (judges and lay judges), and lawyers representing parties (prosecutors, advocates, etc.), have to wear a black court gown (pol. &quot;toga&quot;) paired with a coloured jabot (pol. &quot;żabot&quot;). Some courts (e.g. Warsaw District Court) require court recorders to also wear court dress.

Different legal professions are distinguished by the colour of the jabot and hem of the collar and cuffs:

* White and red (national colours) - judges of Constitutional Tribunal;
* Purple - judges and lay judges (court dress of judges of Supreme Court and State Tribunal has also purple collar and cuffs);
* Red - prosecutors;
* Green - advocates;
* Blue - legal advisers;
* Blue-grey - legal counsellors representing Republic of Poland;
* Black hem, without jabot - court recorders (only in some courts).
==== Chain of office ====
Presiding judges also wear a chain of office (pol. &quot;łańcuch sędziowski&quot;), a bronze collar with central link inscribed with letters &quot;RP&quot; (standing for &quot;Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot;, eng. Republic of Poland) and a silver eagle suspended under the letters. The chain is worn over the collar and jabot. When judges sit in a panel, only the presiding judge wears the collar.

==== Biretta ====
Judges of Constitutional Tribunal, Supreme Court, Supreme Administrative Court and State Tribunal have to wear a biretta (pol. &quot;biret&quot;) (judges of Supreme Administrative Court wear the biretta only when entering and leaving the courtroom, and during sentencing). Judges of different courts are distinguished by different designs of biretta:

* Black - judges of Constitutional Tribunal;
* Purple - judges of Supreme Court and State Tribunal;
* Black with purple hem - judges of Supreme Administrative Court (until 2011 also used by all other judges).

===Sweden===
In Sweden there is no official court dress for judges and judges do not wear gowns. Judges usually wear an ordinary suit.

===United States===

====Judicial court dress====
During the early history of the United States, the court dress of judges and practicing lawyers closely mirrored British court dress of the 18th century; both wore white powdered wigs and (typically) black robes in the lower courts, and in the higher ones, judges would wear red with black markings. The practice fell out of favor and died out by the mid-nineteenth century.

Today, generally judges of both state and federal courts are free to select their own courtroom attire, although some jurisdictions do formally require judges to wear robes of some kind when presiding over hearings in court. The most common choice is a plain black robe which covers the torso and legs, with sleeves. Female judges will sometimes add to the robe a plain white collar or lace jabot. Beneath the robes business attire is standard (although judges will sometimes don business casual attire, since they are only ever seen in court wearing a robe). Typically judges pay for their own custom made judicial robe.
Until the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall, all Supreme Court justices wore red robes with ermine trim and full-bottomed wigs, reminiscent of British court dress. Marshall, however, eschewed this formality and began the practice of only wearing a black silk robe, with no wig. There is some evidence to indicate that the shift to black robes preceded Marshall&#x27;s tenure. In 1995, Chief Justice William Rehnquist added four gold bars (similar in appearance to captain insignia in the US Navy) to each sleeve of his black robe, but the change in his attire (he had been Chief Justice since 1986) was his own innovation and was inspired by a production of the operetta &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, rather than any historical precedent. His successor, John G. Roberts, chose to remain with the traditional plain black robe.

Some Supreme Court justices (including Clarence Thomas, the late Antonin Scalia, and Stephen Breyer, all of whom are or were balding) maintain the ancient legal practice of wearing large black skullcaps, in their case when wearing their robes outdoors in cold weather (for example, at presidential inaugurations in January.)

Many state supreme court justices wear unique styles of robes, the most notable being the Supreme Court of Maryland, where all judges wear red, and British-style tab collars. The judges of the Delaware Superior Court continue to wear the red sashes or baldrics of their British predecessors, albeit now only on ceremonial occasions.

Some judges eschew special dress entirely and preside over their courts in normal business wear. This is often seen among administrative law judges who preside over relatively informal administrative hearings.

====Attorney court dress====
Lawyers wear normal business attire in courts of all levels. During the second-wave feminism movement in the 1970s, some judges forbade female attorneys to wear trousers when appearing in court, but pantsuits are now widely accepted. Like judges, American attorneys do not wear wigs.

Until the 1970s, morning dress was required of all attorneys appearing before the United States Supreme Court by the Court&#x27;s rules. Even after the Court abolished the requirement, the Office of the Solicitor General maintained the practice. When the Solicitor General (or any of the deputies) appears before the U.S. Supreme Court, they wear morning dress, with striped trousers, grey ascot, waistcoat, and a cutaway morning coat. A feminized version is sometimes worn by female deputies, which consists of the same garments tailored to female measurements. During her term as Solicitor General, Elena Kagan appeared before the Court in pantsuits in lieu of morning dress. The traditional female equivalent of morning dress, &quot;softly flowing dresses with hats&quot;, is strictly for social purposes and would be inappropriate attire for appearances before the nation&#x27;s highest court. The Court&#x27;s Marshal and Clerk of both sexes also wear morning dress when the Court is in session.

<text>In geomorphology, a butte () is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller landforms than mesas, plateaus, and tablelands. The word &quot;butte&quot; comes from the French word &quot;butte&quot;, meaning knoll (but of any size); its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where &quot;mesa&quot; (Spanish for &quot;table&quot;) is used for the larger landform. Due to their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. To differentiate the two landforms, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.

==Formation==
Buttes form by weathering and erosion when hard caprock overlies a layer of less resistant rock that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the scree or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms hoodoos.

==Notable buttes==
The Mitten Buttes of Monument Valley in the Utah–Arizona state line are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in the scenes of many western-themed films, including seven movies directed by John Ford. Another very well-known and frequently photographed butte in northern Arizona is Thumb Butte, which overlooks the city of Prescott and is the most prominent and distinctive geologic landmark in the vicinity. The Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming is a laccolithic butte composed of igneous rock rather than sandstone, limestone or other sedimentary rocks.

The term &quot;butte&quot; is sometimes applied more broadly to isolated, steep-sided hills with pointed or craggy, rather than flat, tops. Three notable formations that are either named &quot;butte&quot; or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer&#x27;s rule are Scotts Bluff in Nebraska which is a collection of five bluffs, Crested Butte, which is a mountain in Colorado, and Elephant Butte, which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico.

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are Bear Butte, South Dakota, Black Butte, Oregon, and the Sutter Buttes in California. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word &quot;butte&quot;, for example, Courthouse Rock, Nebraska. Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word, examples of which are Kamiak Butte, Chelan Butte and Steptoe Butte in Washington state.

<doc id="337877" wikidata="Q1605890" url="?curid=337877" title="William Archibald Spooner">
<text>William Archibald Spooner (22 July 1844 – 29 August 1930) was a British clergyman and long-serving Oxford don. He was most notable for his absent-mindedness, and for supposedly mixing up the syllables in a spoken phrase, with unintentionally comic effect. Such phrases became known as spoonerisms, and are often used humorously. Many spoonerisms have been invented and attributed to Spooner.

==Life and career==
William Archibald Spooner was born on 22 July 1844 at 17 Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, London. He was the eldest son of William Spooner and Jane Lydia nee Wilson, who were married in Leeds in Q4 1841. He was educated at Oswestry School (where he was a contemporary of Frederick Gustavus Burnaby) and New College, Oxford, even though he was not a Wykehamist.

He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1872 and priest in 1875. In 1878, he became chaplain to Archbishop Archibald Tait.

William Spooner married Frances Wycliffe Goodwin on 12 September 1878. They had five children: William Wycliffe, Frances Catharine, Rosemary, Ellen Maxwell, and Agnes Mary.

Spooner remained at New College for more than sixty years, serving as fellow (1867), lecturer (1868), tutor (1869), dean (1876–1889) and warden (1903–1924). He lectured on ancient history, divinity and philosophy (especially on Aristotle&#x27;s ethics).

Spooner was well liked and respected, described as &quot;an albino, small, with a pink face, poor eyesight, and a head too large for his body&quot;. It was said that &quot;his reputation was that of a genial, kindly, hospitable man&quot;. In the opinion of Roy Harrod, Spooner exceeded all the heads of Oxford and Cambridge colleges he had known &quot;having regard to his scholarship, devotion to duty, and wisdom&quot;.

Spooner died on 29 August 1930.

==Spoonerisms==

Spooner became famous for his manner of speaking, real or alleged &quot;spoonerisms&quot;, plays on words in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched. Few, if any, of his own spoonerisms were deliberate, and many of those attributed to him are apocryphal. Spooner is said to have disliked the reputation gained for getting his words muddled.

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: &quot;The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer.&quot; (rate of wages) In a 1928 interview, Spooner himself admitted to uttering &quot;Kinkering Congs Their Titles Take&quot; (Conquering Kings). Spooner called this hymn out from the pulpit in 1879.

Many other quotations, &quot;probable and improbable, were invented&quot; and attributed to Spooner, including:

* &quot;It is kisstomary to cuss the bride&quot; (...customary to kiss the bride)
* &quot;I am tired of addressing beery wenches&quot; (weary benches)
* &quot;Mardon me padam, this pie is occupewed. Can I sew you to another sheet?&quot; (Pardon me, madam, this pew is occupied. Can I show you to another seat?)
* &quot;You have hissed all my mystery lectures, and were caught fighting a liar in the quad.&quot; (You have missed all my history lectures, and were caught lighting a fire in the quad).
* &quot;You have tasted two worms&quot; to a student who wasted two terms.
* &quot;You will leave by the next town drain&quot; (You will leave by the next down train)
Spooner is supposed to have committed other absent-minded gaffes. He was said to have invited a don to tea, &quot;to welcome Stanley Casson, our new archaeology Fellow&quot;. &quot;But, sir&quot;, the man replied, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; Stanley Casson&quot;. &quot;Never mind&quot;, Spooner said, &quot;Come all the same&quot;.

On his death, &quot;The Times&quot; recorded that &quot;He was not afraid of conversation&quot;.

* &quot;Bishop Butler&quot; (1901)

<doc id="337883" wikidata="Q988482" url="?curid=337883" title="Borland Sidekick">
<text>Borland Sidekick was a personal information manager (PIM) launched by American software company Borland in 1984 under Philippe Kahn&#x27;s leadership. It was an early and popular terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) for MS-DOS which enabled computer users to activate the program using a hot key combination (by default: Ctrl-Alt) while working in other programs. Although a text-mode program, Sidekick&#x27;s window-based interface echoed that of the Apple Macintosh and anticipated the eventual look of Microsoft Windows 2.0. It included a personal calendar, text editor (with WordStar-like command interface), calculator, ASCII chart, address book, and phone dialer. According to the prospectus for Borland&#x27;s initial public offering of stock to the public, Sidekick sold more than 1 million copies in its first three years.

==Origin==
According to Philippe Kahn, Borland did not originally intend to sell Sidekick. It developed the utility to assist the small company&#x27;s employees. After several months of use Borland realized that it had a sellable product.

==Versions==

===MS-DOS===

====1.0====
Sidekick 1.0 included Calculator, Notepad, Appointment Calendar, Auto Dialer, ASCII Table and other tools.

====1.0 Plus====
Sidekick 1.0 Plus included a broader selection of calculators (Business, Scientific, Programmer, Formula), a 9-file Notepad text editor, Appointment Book and Scheduler, a terminal communication tool and ASCII Table. In addition to variants on and enhancements to the 1.0 features, Plus included a 9-file Outliner, a file and directory manager, Clipboard, and supported Expanded Memory and a RAM disk. Control+Alt is the default shortcut to open sidekick 1.0 plus

====1.5====
Sidekick 1.5 improved compatibility with graphical programs, and specifically with Lotus Symphony and Microsoft Word.

====2.0====
Sidekick 2.0 was the last MS-DOS version.

====Traveling Sidekick====
Traveling Sidekick included a 3-ring binder notebook with solar-powered pocket calculator, and Sidekick software.

===Windows===
When Philippe Kahn left Borland in 1994 to found Starfish Software, he acquired all rights to Sidekick from Borland. Starfish&#x27;s co-founder Sonia Lee Kahn designed the look and feel of Sidekick 95, which was launched simultaneously with Windows 95 with great success. In 1998 Philippe Kahn and Sonia Lee Kahn sold Starfish to Motorola for $325 Million in a private transaction. Starfish was later bought by Nokia who discontinued the product, with Sidekick 99 being the last version. T-Mobile USA, Inc. currently owns the Sidekick trademark portfolio.
Later versions of the program were made available for Windows, with the last versions featuring a phone dialer and syncing with Palm, Windows CE, and EPOC devices. These versions were less popular than the MS-DOS versions, largely because the Windows environment itself provided most of the original version&#x27;s key features: task switching and a collection of small utilities. It did however, include a monthly/yearly calendar and a world time map showing which parts of the world are currently in daylight or darkness. Up to eight different world cities (which could be edited) were displayed above and below the map.

====1.0====
Sidekick 1.0 for Windows was developed and released by Borland before Kahn left the company. It was designed for Windows 3.1 and included Calendar, To Do List, Contacts, a communication tool and a calculator. However, most of the design and file system came from the &quot;YourWay&quot; PIM software, purchased by Borland from Prisma Software in 1993. As the November 7, 1994 &quot;Info World&quot; noted, &quot;Despite its name, the only connection between Sidekick for Windows 1.0 and the venerable Sidekick for MS-DOS is that Borland International owns both programs. Sidekick for Windows is a combination of the calendaring code from Prisma Software Corp.&#x27;s Windows PIM &quot;YourWay&quot; (purchased by Borland last year) and a completely new interface developed by Borland.&quot;

====2.0====
Sidekick 2.0 was also developed and initially released by Borland before the move to Starfish.

New/modified features included:
* overlapping appointments in the Scheduler,
* multiple contact files in the Address Book,
* print layouts that enabled users to print to commercial day planner pages,
* View-in-View,
* Backup &amp; Restore of user&#x27;s files,
* password protection.

Sidekick Deluxe added more than 40 content files for access to online information, Dashboard 3.0 for Windows, and the &quot;Organized for Success&quot; video. It was distributed in CD format.

===OS/2===
Borland Sidekick 2.0 for Presentation Manager was based on Sidekick 2.0 for Windows.

===Macintosh===
Borland introduced a version for the Apple Macintosh in 1985. It was a product initially called MacDesk, developed by CE Software.

==Reception==
Borland sold 400,000 copies of Sidekick by September 1985. Rating it as &quot;Excellent&quot; in all categories, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in November 1984 that &quot;whoever wrote this gem understands Murphy&#x27;s law ... Sidekick stands in the shadows behind whatever program you are using&quot;. Noting that for programmers, the software was less expensive &quot;and a lot handier&quot; than a Texas Instruments hexadecimal calculator, the magazine concluded that &quot;Sidekick is a time-saving, frustrating-saving bargain [and] is the first step to making paper and pencil obsolete&quot;. Jerry Pournelle praised Sidekick in &quot;Byte&quot; in October 1984: &quot;Philippe Kahn ... now has a product that IBM PC users won&#x27;t be able to do without. He ought to sell a zillion copies&quot;. Elsewhere in the issue, the magazine stated that Sidekick&#x27;s existence &quot;seems to point out a major drawback in quite a few integrated software packages. Why should owners of advanced, multifunction business programs that are supposedly easy to use and that claim to solve all problems be compelled to purchase a utility like Sidekick? It makes you wonder about all those advertising claims&quot;. In 1985 Pournelle selected Sidekick as one of his products of the year for the IBM PC, and said in 1987 that he would soon have to stop using a CP/M computer to write because tools like Sidekick were unavailable. &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed SideKick Plus as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating &quot;Talk about a bang for the buck&quot;.

<text>Bronisław Kaper (; February 5, 1902 – April 26, 1983) was a Polish film composer who scored films and musical theater in Germany, France, and the USA. The American immigration authorities misspelled his name as Bronislau Kaper. He was also variously credited as Bronislaw Kaper, Bronislaw Kapper, Benjamin Kapper, and Edward Kane.

Kaper is perhaps best remembered as the composer of the jazz standards &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; (lyrics by Ned Washington) and &quot;Invitation&quot; (lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) which were the respective title songs for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; (1947) and &quot;Invitation&quot; (1952). He also scored the MGM film musical &quot;Lili&quot; (1953) for which he received the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Kaper&#x27;s later works include &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965) and the TV series &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; (1965–1974).

==Biography==
Bronisław Kaper was born in Warsaw, Poland, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family, and began playing the piano at the age of six, and soon demonstrated considerable talent on this instrument. He studied composition and piano at the Warsaw Conservatory, and law at Warsaw University, in deference to his father&#x27;s wishes. Soon after completing his studies, Kaper went to Berlin—then a city teeming with theaters and cabarets, where many artists from other parts of Europe lived.

In Berlin, in the late 1920s, Kaper met another young composer, the Austrian Walter Jurmann. The two worked as a team, first in Berlin and then, after the Nazis took power in Germany, in Paris, France. The emergence of sound film created a major market for their talents. In Paris, they composed music for films directed by persons who had fled the rise of Nazism and consequent persecution of Jews and other minorities.

In 1935, upon being offered a seven-year contract with MGM by studio head Louis B. Mayer, Kaper and Jurmann emigrated to the United States, where they continued their work. One of their first American films was the Marx Brothers comedy &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935), for which they composed the song &quot;Cosi-Cosa&quot;. Kaper and Jurmann also co-wrote the theme song for the 1936 film &quot;San Francisco&quot;. They worked again with the Marx Brothers on their follow-up film, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), for which Kaper, Jurmann, and Gus Kahn wrote the song &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot;, which became a minor jazz standard.
Kaper was part of a significant community of refugees in Los Angeles during the 1940s who had fled Nazi-occupied/war-torn Europe for the United States. This community included composers, writers, and filmmakers such as Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Arnold Schoenberg, Lion Feuchtwanger, Max Reinhardt, Hanns Eisler, and Berthold and Salka Viertel.

His sole musical theater venture in New York was 1946&#x27;s &quot;Polonaise,&quot; for which he both adapted music by Chopin, and composed many numbers himself.

In 1947, Kaper scored the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot;, whose title song &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; (lyrics by Ned Washington) is perhaps Kaper&#x27;s most enduring and popular composition. It has since become a jazz standard, recorded by artists including Miles Davis, Sarah Vaughan, John Coltrane, Tony Bennett, and Eric Dolphy. Kaper composed perhaps his second most-enduring song &quot;Invitation (song)&quot; (lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) for director George Cukor&#x27;s melodrama &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot;; but it was not until its use as the theme song for the 1952 film &quot;Invitation&quot; that the song became popular. &quot;Invitation&quot; has been widely recorded, by artists including Quincy Jones, Rosemary Clooney, Dinah Washington, and Jaco Pastorius as the title track of his 1983 album &quot;Invitation (Jaco Pastorius album)&quot;. In 1954, Kaper won an Oscar for scoring of the musical &quot;Lili&quot; (1953) starring Leslie Caron, and featuring Kaper&#x27;s song &quot;Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo&quot; with lyrics by Helen Deutsch. Kaper also scored Caron&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot;, a musical adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella.

In 1959, Kaper composed most of the music for MGM&#x27;s production of &quot;Green Mansions&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins, after MGM had asked Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos to write the score. Only some of Villa-Lobos&#x27; music was used in the film; much of the rest was later arranged as the secular cantata &quot;Forest of the Amazons&quot;, which Villa-Lobos recorded in stereophonic sound for United Artists Records with the Symphony of the Air. One of Kaper&#x27;s last projects under his MGM contract was also his most ambitious: the big-budget 1962 remake of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; starring Marlon Brando, for which he wrote epic seafaring melodies as well as native Polynesian music (Nominated for Academy Award for Best Musical Score). MGM had originally wanted composer Miklós Rózsa (who was known for lush epics) to score this remake, but Rózsa declined. The film&#x27;s love theme &quot;Love Song from Mutiny on the Bounty (Follow Me)&quot; has found a place in the repertoire of popular Polynesian music and is occasionally performed for tourists at Luaus. Kaper&#x27;s interest in melding exotic indigenous music with traditional styles continued in &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, where he introduced Western audiences to the unique sound of the southeast-Asian gamelan orchestra. For television, Kaper composed the theme music and several scores for the Quinn Martin-produced series &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; In total, Kaper composed music for nearly 150 Hollywood films.

==Credits on Broadway==
*&quot;Polonaise&quot; (1945) – musical – composer
*&quot;Mostly Sondheim&quot; (2002) – concert – featured songwriter

==Recordings - film scores==
Recordings of many of Kaper&#x27;s film scores were not available in his lifetime but, in recent decades, many of these previously unavailable recordings have been re-released and/or re-recorded on compact disc for labels like Monstrous Movie Music (&quot;Them!&quot;), and Film Score Monthly (&quot;Lili&quot;, &quot;Home from the Hill&quot;, &quot;The Swan&quot; and others).

==Legacy==
===The Bronisław Kaper Awards===
The Bronisław Kaper Awards For Young Artists are held annually by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the piano and strings instrumental categories, which alternate each year. Named in honor of Bronisław Kaper, who served for more than 15 years as a member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association&#x27;s Board of Directors, the Awards encourage the development of young and gifted musicians. Award winners receive monetary awards: first place receiving $2,500, second place receiving $2,000 and Most Promising Musician winning $500.

The 2007 Bronisław Kaper Awards competition has been for string players.

<text>A farmers&#x27; market (or farmers market according to the AP stylebook, also farmer&#x27;s market in the Cambridge Dictionary) is a physical retail marketplace intended to sell foods directly by farmers to consumers. Farmers&#x27; markets may be indoors or outdoors and typically consist of booths, tables or stands where farmers sell their produce, live animals and plants, and sometimes prepared foods and beverages. Farmers&#x27; markets exist in many countries worldwide and reflect the local culture and economy. The size of the market may be just a few stalls or it may be as large as several city blocks. Due to their nature, they tend to be less rigidly regulated than retail produce shops.

They are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products.

==History==
The current concept of a farmers&#x27; market is similar to past concepts, but different in relation to other forms – as aspects of consumer retailing, overall, continue to shift over time. Similar forms existed before the Industrial Age, but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others&#x27; products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience, while abstracting it further from production and from production&#x27;s growing complexities.

Modern industrial food production&#x27;s advantages over prior methods depend largely on modern, cheap, fast transport and limited product variability. But transport costs and delays cannot be eliminated. So where distance strained industrial suppliers&#x27; reach, where consumers had strong preference for local variety, farmers&#x27; markets remained competitive with other forms of food retail. Starting in the mid-2000s, consumer demand for foods that are fresher (spend less time in transit) and for foods with more variety—has led to growth of farmers&#x27; markets as a food-retailing mechanism.

==Benefits==
===To farmers===
Farmers&#x27; markets can offer farmers increased profit over selling to wholesalers, food processors, or large grocery firms. By selling directly to consumers, produce often needs less transport, less handling, less refrigeration and less time in storage. By selling in an outdoor market, the cost of land, buildings, lighting and air-conditioning is also reduced or eliminated. Farmers may also retain profit on produce not sold to consumers, by selling the excess to canneries and other food-processing firms. At the market, farmers can retain the full premium for part of their produce, instead of only a processor&#x27;s wholesale price for the entire lot. However, other economists say &quot;there are relatively few benefits in terms of energy efficiency, quality or cost ... fun though they are, are not good economic models.&quot;

Some farmers prefer the simplicity, immediacy, transparency and independence of selling direct to consumers. One method noted by the special interest group Food Empowerment Project promotes community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs). In this scheme, consumers pay farms seasonally or monthly to receive weekly or biweekly boxes of produce. Alternatively, they may be required to pay for an entire season&#x27;s worth of produce in advance of the growing season. In either case, consumers risk losing their money if there is a crop failure.

===To communities===
Among the benefits often touted for communities with farmers&#x27; markets:

* Farmers&#x27; markets help maintain important social ties, linking rural and urban populations and even close neighbors in mutually rewarding exchange.
* market traffic generates traffic for nearby businesses
* buying at markets encourages attention to the surrounding area and ongoing activities
* by providing outlets for &#x27;local&#x27; products, farmers&#x27; markets help create distinction and uniqueness, which can increase pride and encourage visitors to return.
Reduced transport, storage, and refrigeration can benefit communities too:
* lower transport &amp; refrigeration energy costs
* lower transport pollution
* lower transport infrastructure cost (roads, bridges, etc.)
* less land dedicated to food storage

Farmers&#x27; markets may also contribute to innovative distribution means that strengthen civic engagement by reducing the social distances between urban and rural communities. With fewer intermediaries, the support of independent growers by local community members can enhance local economic opportunities and health &amp; wellness in poor communities.

===To consumers===
Some consumers may favor farmers&#x27; markets for the perceived:

* reduced overhead: driving, parking, etc.
* fresher foods
* seasonal foods
* healthier foods
* a better &quot;variety&quot; of foods, e.g.: organic foods, pasture-raised meats, free-range eggs and poultry, handmade farmstead cheeses, heirloom produce heritage breeds of meat and many less transport-immune cultivars disfavored by large grocers
* a place to meet neighbors, chat, etc.
* a place to enjoy an outdoor walk &quot;while&quot; getting needed groceries

Evidence seems to show that overall prices at a typical farmers&#x27; market are lower than prices at a supermarket because the process of production is more concise; there is less distance to travel, and fewer middlemen.

==Regional emphasis==
===China===

The traditional public markets in Chinese cities are known as &quot;wet markets&quot; (菜市场) where most vendors are resellers. The Chinese government has attempted to transform these traditional markets to supermarkets in urban renovation projects. It has led to a decline of these markets in some cities such as Shanghai. Yet, in other cities, wet markets persist and dominate the retail of fresh produce and meat. Because of its critical role in ensuring urban food security, wet markets receive various supports from the local government.

After 2010, farmers&#x27; markets in China were reborn in some major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu amidst the food safety crisis. These farmers&#x27; markets (农夫市集) provide venues for local small ecological farmers to sell their produce within the city, catering urban middle-class&#x27;s growing demand for high quality food. Many of these market vendors are operating community-supported agriculture.

===European Union===

The EU has formalized efforts to expand farmers&#x27; markets to reduce food safety risks and poor nutrition through programs known as &quot;Farm to Fork&quot;.

Farm-to-fork was developed with three main goals within the EU: 
* To develop effective forms of execution and evaluation of food safety standards
* To work internationally with third world countries and organizations that manage food safety concerns
* To comply with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) standards of research and its management of science-based research

===United Kingdom===
Since the first farmers&#x27; market was established in the UK in 1997, the number has grown to over 550 nationwide. A number of factors led to the rise of farmers&#x27; markets in the UK in the late 1990s, including the increasing knowledge of consumers, the struggles of British farmers, anti-French sentiment, and concerns over food safety and quality. Consumers were worried about the farming practices by which food is produced, processed and the health and safety aspects of certain foods. The emergence of books, magazine articles, and cookery and gardening programmes influence consumer concern of food preparation and consumption.

===United States===

Due in part to the increased interest in healthier foods, a greater desire to preserve local cultivars or livestock (some of which may not be up to commercial shipping or yield standards) and an increased understanding of the importance of maintaining small, sustainable farms on the fringe of urban environments, farmers&#x27; markets in the US have grown from 1,755 in 1994 to 4,385 in 2006, to 5,274 in 2009, to 8,144 in 2013. In New York City, there are 107 farmers&#x27; markets in operation. In the Los Angeles area, 88 farmers&#x27; markets exist, many of which support Hispanic and Asian fare.

In the U.S., all levels of government have provided funding to farmers&#x27; markets, for instance, through the federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Farmers&#x27; Market Nutrition Program, and the Senior Farmers&#x27; Market Nutrition Program. The programs primarily subsidize purchases at farmers&#x27; markets by low-income residents. Examples include Austin&#x27;s Double Dollar Incentive Program, Boston&#x27;s Bounty Bucks, Chicago&#x27;s LINK Up, Columbia Heights Festibucks in Washington, D.C., Fresh Checks in East Palo Alto, Market Match in Los Angeles, Michigan&#x27;s Double Up Food Bucks, New York City&#x27;s Health Bucks, Portland Fresh Exchange, and Seattle Fresh Bucks. These programs often rely in part on nonprofit support.

==Management==

A wide range of organizations initiate, organize, and manage farmers&#x27; markets, including farmers&#x27; groups, community groups, local governments, etc.

Some markets are strictly managed, with rules for pricing, quality and vendor selection. Others are much more relaxed in their operations and vendor criteria. While the usual emphasis is on locally grown food products, some farmers&#x27; markets allow co-ops and purveyors, or allow farmers to purchase some products to resell.

There have been recent reports of fraud and products mislabeled as organic or locally grown when they are not. In some cases, fraudulent farmers&#x27; markets sell regular grocery store vegetables, passing them off as organic or locally grown, to which are usually sold to unsuspecting tourists.

Some farmers&#x27; markets have wholesale operations, sometimes limited to specific days or hours. One such wholesale farmers&#x27; market is the South Carolina State Farmers Market, which is a major supplier of watermelons, cantaloupes, and peaches for produce buyers in the north-eastern US. Farmers&#x27; markets also may supply buyers from produce stands, restaurants, and garden stores with fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seedlings and nursery stock, honey, and other agricultural products. Although this is on the decline, in part due to the growth of chain stores that desire national distribution networks and cheap wholesales prices—prices driven down by the low cost of imported produce.

==Product categories==
===Pork and beef products===
A wide variety of beef and pork products are sold at farmers&#x27; markets in the United States. Typical beef products include steaks, ground beef, jerky, and various types of beef sausage. Typical pork products include sausage and bacon.

Beef and pork products sold at farmers&#x27; market in the US, like those of any other beef/pork product that are sold to the public, must originate from livestock slaughtered in a government (federal or state) inspected slaughterhouse. Since government inspected slaughterhouses purchase livestock for slaughter, many often have the facilities, equipment, and personnel to supply meat products to distributors/wholesalers. Like restaurants, such arrangements are popular with farmers&#x27; market vendors because they allow them to avoid the overhead costs (facility, equipment, knowledge, maintenance, food safety inspections, etc.) associated with producing meat products that may be legally sold to the public. Resell vendors are in the majority at farmers&#x27; markets while vendors that make and package their own meat products represent a very small percentage. Reselling allows vendors to minimize investment and overhead costs by purchasing their products from a commercial slaughterhouse and/or processing plant.

Meat products at farmers&#x27; markets being sold by resellers will include a &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot;, or similar, statement on the labels of their meat products. Conversely, meat products being sold at farmers&#x27; markets that are prepared and packaged by the selling vendor will not include a &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot;, or similar, statement.

==== Unprocessed meat ====

Unprocessed meat (retail cut) products found at farmers&#x27; markets may include a government inspection legend plus a &quot;distributed by/packed for/prepared for&quot; label. Other information on the label will include weight, price, and safe handling instructions.

The official inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST) that identifies the last company that did the processing/butchering, packaging, and labeling of the product. Since the label includes the &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot; statement, the meat may come from the livestock of other farmers/ranchers or a corporate feedlot. The presence of a government inspection legend identifies a meat product that was not processed and packed by the selling vendor. Meat products prepared and packed by the selling vendor or butcher will not include a government seal, and will not include any type of statement that classifies the vendor as a reseller/distributor.

The labels on retail beef and pork products that originate a vendor&#x27;s/rancher&#x27;s livestock will not include the &quot;distributed by/packed for/prepared for&quot; statement. Note that the label will still have an official/government Inspection Legend that identifies the establishment that performed the slaughtering, butchering, packaging, and labeling because any product leaving a slaughterhouse to be sold for human consumption must have a government inspection legend. For example, a label that does not have a &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot;, etc. statement ensures the buyer that, while the vendor did not do the butchering/packaging/etc., the meat did originate from the vendor&#x27;s livestock.

The label on a meat product that is processed and packed by the selling vendor will not include a government inspection legend and it will not include a &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot; statement.

Retail cuts of meat products sold by a vendor that performs its own butchering, packaging, and labeling will not include a government inspection legend or a &quot;distributed by/packed for&quot; statement on the label. In such cases the vendor/butcher gets the carcass or other major cuts of meat from a government inspected slaughterhouse and does the secondary butchering (&quot;fabrication&quot;), packaging, and labeling in its own facility. A government official inspection legend is not required on a package of meat butchered and packaged by such a vendor because it is sold directly to the consumer.

==== Processed meats ====

Most processed meat products (sausage, bacon, hot dogs, frankfurters, snack sticks) sold at farmers&#x27; markets have labels that include a &quot;distributed by/packed for/etc.&quot; statement as well as a government inspection legend. The government inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST #) that identifies the commercial processing plant that made and packaged the products; similar to a package of sausage or bacon sold in supermarkets. Alternately, a processed meat product sold at a farmers&#x27; market that does not include a &quot;distributed by/packed for/etc.&quot; statement and a government inspection legend is a product that is made and packaged by the selling vendor. There are also vendors that sell processed meat products that include a government inspection legend without a &quot;distributed by/packed for/etc.&quot; statement; such vendors are selling co-pack products in which the maker/producer prepares and packages the product according to the vendors&#x27; recipe.

===== Reseller =====
Wholesale processed meat products that are resold at farmers&#x27; markets are known as &quot;private label&quot; products. Such products will include a &quot;distributed by/packed for/etc.&quot; statement plus a government inspection legend that provides a number that identifies the product&#x27;s producer. The numbers of critics of private label products are increasing as consumers become aware of poor practices often employed by the products&#x27; producers.

It is not unusual to find distributors/resellers of processed meat products at farmers&#x27; markets because wholesale products allow vendors to minimize their investment by not having to pay for the overhead (knowledge, skills, equipment, supplies, maintenance, food safety inspections, packaging, labeling, etc.) required to produce their own products. A wholesale package of processed meat will bear a label that has a government inspection legend. The inspection legend will usually have an Establishment Number (EST #) that identifies the processing plant that made and packaged the product. Additionally, the package will contain a phrase similar to &quot;distributed by: Steve&#x27;s Family Meat Company&quot; or &quot;packed/prepared for Steve&#x27;s Family Meat Company&quot; somewhere on the label. Both the producer (identified by the EST. # in the inspection legend) and distributor/reseller (for example Steve&#x27;s Family Meat Company) will be identified on the label.

===== Independent processor =====
A product label of a farmers&#x27; market vendor that makes and packages its own product will not include a &quot;distributed by/packed for/etc.&quot; statement, and it will not have a government inspection legend because its products are sold directly to the consumer. Information on the producing vendor&#x27;s label will include the following information:
* Name of company
* Address
* Product name
* Ingredients
* Date code
* Safe handling instructions
It will not include a government inspection legend or seal.

===Produce and fruit===
Ideally, farmers&#x27; market produce and fruit are normally grown within a geographical region that is deemed local by the market&#x27;s management. The term &quot;local&quot; is defined by the farmers&#x27; market and usually represents products grown within a given radius measured in miles or kilometers. Many farmers&#x27; markets state that they are &quot;producer only&quot; markets, and that their vendors grow all products sold. Some farmers&#x27; markets do not use the term &quot;producer only&quot; and may allow resellers of produce, fruit, and other food products.

Some farmers&#x27; markets allow vendors to resell vegetables and fruits if they are not available locally due to the time of the year. Vegetables, fruit, meat, and other products resold at farmers&#x27; markets are available to vendors through food distributors. This is a common practice and provides consumers with produce and fruit that are unavailable at certain times of the year. In many markets resell items are a permanent part of the vendor&#x27;s inventory.

There are four subject areas that consumers tend to consider when purchasing food directly from the producer:
* Variety name
* Whether the product is in-season
* Verifiability of the origins of the food
* Whether any products have a PLU (price look-up code) sticker

All vegetables and fruits have unique names that distinguish them from any other, whether they are for commercial use, for home gardening, or heirloom. A number or alphanumeric string usually identifies the newer commercial varieties. Vendors&#x27; employees might not always know the variety names of the produce they are selling but they will be able to get a list from their employer (producer). There are vendors that violate rules by reselling products at Producer Only markets.

===Dairy, poultry, and other products===
Depending on the farmers&#x27; markets, a wide variety of products are available. Poultry, lamb, goat, eggs, milk, cream, ice cream, butter, cheese, honey, syrup, jams, jellies, sauces, mushrooms, flowers, wool, wine, beer, breads, and pastries are some examples of vendor produced products sold at farmers&#x27; markets. Many farmers&#x27; markets allow vendors to prepare and sell ready to eat foods and drinks.

==Fraud==

Some investigations in the United States and Canada have found shops in farmers markets selling fruits and vegetables not sourced from their own farms. In September 2017, a hidden camera investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that some of the stalls in one market purchased produce on the wholesale market and removed the original stickers, raising the cost to 50% above the retail prices.

&quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; food critic and investigative reporter Laura Reiley found some vendors at local farmers&#x27; markets selling rejected produce from local wholesale markets, or selling produce purchased from non-local sources. In some cases they claimed to sell products from their own farm at first, but when pressed admitted that they had grown none of the products for sale. In at least one case, despite vendor claims to the contrary, the farm in question was not growing any food, and the produce was all purchased from other companies. Fraud may sometimes be obvious because the type of food being sold does not grow locally or is out of season. Federal regulations in the United States require country of origin labeling for produce at supermarkets but not for small independent vendors.

The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; also found that packaged foods, such as sauces, honey, jam, and beef jerky may appear to be from local vendors due to the local company&#x27;s branding on the packaging, but are actually produced at co-packer plants with non-local ingredients. In the United States, the FDA requires that the manufacturer&#x27;s name and address be listed on the food label, which can reveal this discrepancy.

==Health risks==
Food safety regulations often carve out exceptions for farmers&#x27; markets. In the United States, for example, if the produce does not cross state lines it is exempt from the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. Farmers markets increase the number of outbreaks and cases of food-borne illness, norovirus, and campylobacter.

<doc id="337907" wikidata="Q3039412" url="?curid=337907" title="Drew Pinsky">
<text>David Drew Pinsky (born September 4, 1958), commonly known as Dr. Drew, is an American media personality, internist, and addiction medicine specialist. He hosted the nationally syndicated radio talk show &quot;Loveline&quot; from the show&#x27;s inception in 1984 until its end in 2016. On television, he hosted the talk show &quot;Dr. Drew On Call&quot; on HLN and the daytime series &quot;Lifechangers&quot; on The CW. In addition, he served as producer and starred in the VH1 show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, and its spinoffs &quot;Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House&quot;. Pinsky currently hosts several podcasts, including &quot;Ask Dr. Drew&quot;, &quot;The Dr. Drew Podcast&quot; on the PodcastOne Network, and &quot;The Adam and Drew Show&quot; with his former &quot;Loveline&quot; co-host Adam Carolla. From February 2019 - December 2023, he hosted &quot;Dr. Drew After Dark&quot; on the Your Mom&#x27;s House network.

Pinsky is a former staff member at the Department of Chemical Dependency Services at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, California, and Huntington Memorial Hospital. He currently maintains a private internal medicine practice in South Pasadena.

==Early life==
Pinsky was born in 1958 in Pasadena, California, to a Jewish family. His father, Morton Pinsky (1926–2009), was a physician whose parents immigrated to the United States from Ukraine. His mother, Helene Stanton (née Eleanor Mae Stansbury; 1925–2017), was a singer and actress who came from a &quot;highly Victorian upper-middle-class family in Philadelphia&quot;. and played a supporting part in the 1955 film &quot;The Big Combo&quot;.

After graduating from Polytechnic School in 1976, Pinsky studied biology at Amherst College, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts. He then attended the University of Southern California&#x27;s Keck School of Medicine, graduating in 1984 with a Doctor of Medicine degree. He served his residency in internal medicine at USC County Hospital and became chief resident at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, and later moved into private practice.

==Career==

As &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it in February 2008, Pinsky&#x27;s dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to &quot;navigat[e] a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness.&quot;

===Radio work===

In 1984, while still a medical student, Pinsky started appearing in &quot;Ask a Surgeon&quot;, a segment of a Sunday night KROQ-FM show hosted by Jim &quot;Poorman&quot; Trenton and &quot;Swedish&quot; Egil Aalvik. &quot;Ask the Surgeon&quot; soon combined with &quot;Loveline&quot;, another Sunday night segment, into a show of its own, co-hosted by Trenton and Pinsky. &quot;Loveline&quot; went national in 1995, and the television version launched on MTV the following year, hosted by Pinsky and Adam Carolla.

The exposure on both radio and television made Pinsky the &quot;Gen-X answer to Ruth Westheimer [Dr. Ruth], with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message.&quot; The MTV show ran for four years, while the radio show continued until April 2016 with cohost Mike Catherwood.

On November 27, 2007, Pinsky began &quot;Dr. Drew Live&quot;, another nationally syndicated talk radio show where he focused on a wider range of health issues. It originated from KGIL in Los Angeles, originally airing weekdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm PT The show was canceled in December 2008.

On January 5, 2015, Pinsky launched a new weekday program, &quot;Dr. Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood&quot;, on KABC in Los Angeles. Leeann Tweeden became the co-host of the show starting on January 7, 2019.

On April 21, 2016, Pinsky announced &quot;Loveline&quot; would wrap up on April 28, 2016. Adam Carolla re-joined him as co-host for the final show.

===Television===

Pinsky&#x27;s first television appearance was as a contestant on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in 1984, though he did not win. He also served as &quot;health and human relations expert&quot; on the first season of the U.S. TV series &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2000.

He has also hosted several shorter educational television series, starting with &quot;Strictly Sex with Dr. Drew&quot;, which ran for 10 episodes on the Discovery Health Channel, followed by Strictly Dr. Drew which addressed everyday health concerns. He later hosted the MTV series &quot;Sex...with Mom and Dad&quot; (2008–2009).

In 2008, Pinsky starred in &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, a reality television show which involves celebrities in a drug rehabilitation facility. The show was filmed at Pasadena Recovery Center, with Pinsky serving as the resident medical expert. The series premiered January 10, 2008 on VH-1 and was renewed for multiple seasons. A follow-up show to &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; with many of the same celebrities was &quot;Sober House&quot;, which began its first season in January 2009, and included celebrities from the first two seasons of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; continuing their recovery in a sober living facility. In November 2009, Pinsky starred in a spinoff of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;, &quot;Sex Rehab with Dr.Drew&quot;, which depicted celebrities being treated for sexual addiction over the course of three weeks at the Pasadena Recovery Center.

In a 2011 episode of Lifechangers, Dr. Drew brought on a 16 year old Courtney Stodden and conducted an on-air ultrasound of her breasts to prove Stodden&#x27;s claim she didn&#x27;t have plastic surgery. The ultrasound was conducted by Dr. John Diaz, a plastic surgeon.

Pinsky makes guest appearances on various news programs where he usually gives his observations on the relationship between controlled substances and high-profile individuals. He has frequently given his views on the deaths of people such as Anna Nicole Smith, Heath Ledger and Michael Jackson, arguing that their fates should set examples of the seriousness of misusing drugs.

Pinsky has acted in several TV appearances (either portraying himself or a fictional character), &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;. &quot;The Adam Carolla Project&quot;, &quot;Minoriteam&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot;, &quot;Code Monkeys&quot;, and &quot;The Midnight Gospel&quot;. Pinsky also appeared in the films &quot;New York Minute&quot; and &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;.

In early 2011, Pinsky began hosting his own show, &quot;Dr. Drew On Call&quot; on HLN that focuses on news involving health and addiction topics. On August 26, 2016, HLN and Pinsky announced that the show&#x27;s last episode would be September 22 of that year.

On October 9, 2019, Pinsky competed in season two of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Eagle&quot;.

In 2023, Pinsky appeared on the reality TV series &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot;. He was eliminated in the first episode due to a medical problem.

===Other work===
In 1999, Pinsky co-founded an Internet-based community and advice site for teenagers called DrDrew.com with Curtis Giesen. Among their early backers was Garage.com. DrDrew.com soon ran out of funding, and the company was sold to Sherwood Partners Inc., a corporate restructuring firm, which sold the remnants to DrKoop.com in November 2000. Pinsky re-acquired the site circa 2013 and began using it for general information about his books, radio and TV shows, as well as hosting his independent podcast, &quot;The Dr. Drew Podcast&quot;. In September 2012, Pinsky announced on &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; that he will be doing a podcast on the Carolla Digital network.

In 2003, Pinsky authored &quot;Cracked: Putting Broken Lives Together Again,&quot; recounting his experiences as the medical director of the Department of Chemical Dependency Services at the Las Encinas Hospital drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, California. He also contributed to the book &quot;When Painkillers Become Dangerous: What Everyone Needs to Know About OxyContin and Other Prescription Drugs,&quot; published in 2004.

In addition to his media appearances, Pinsky speaks at college campuses and other public venues. When Adam Carolla and Pinsky were teamed as hosts of &quot;Loveline&quot;, Carolla and Pinsky spoke at colleges.

Pinsky was the voice of 1-800-GET-THIN, advocating lap band surgery on radio ads and in a recording played for those who called 1-800-GET-THIN.

He also appeared with his dogs in a PETA ad campaign promoting the spaying and neutering of pets.

Pinsky also narrated for the 2014 documentary &quot;Divorce Corp&quot; and &quot;Teen Species&quot;.

In early 2019, Pinsky started an online podcast &quot;Dr Drew after Dark&quot;. The podcast is hosted at Tom Segura&#x27;s studio &quot;Studio Jeans&quot;.

Pinsky was featured in the first episode Netflix series &quot;The Midnight Gospel&quot;.

On September 10, 2020, it was announced that Dr. Drew Pinsky joined Aditx Therapeutics as Senior Advisor to AditxtScore for Scoring the Immune System. In October, he first appeared on the &quot;Frenemies&quot; podcast, and appeared on the podcast again in December.

===Honors===
Asteroid 4536 Drewpinsky is named in his honor.

Pinsky was honored with the Larry Stewart Leadership and Inspiration Award at the 12th Annual PRISM Awards in 2008.

==Controversies==

===COVID-19===

Between February and March 2020, Pinsky made a series of statements concerning the COVID-19 outbreak where he downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic, stating that it was not as bad as the flu, and suggested that it was a &quot;press-induced panic&quot;. Pinsky apologized in April 2020, and he urged people to follow the advice of Anthony Fauci.

Despite this, Pinsky continued publicly endorsing anti-vaccine and COVID-minimizing theories. In 2023, he joined The Wellness Company, notorious for selling “anti-spike” supplements and pushing anti-vaccine claims.

===L.A. County homeless commission===

Pinsky has raised concerns for several years regarding homelessness in Los Angeles County and has been critical of how the government has handled it, stating, &quot;For some reason, the government has taken the position that this is a housing problem, which, of course, housing is a piece of this, but for most—and by most I mean the vast majority of people on the streets—their condition makes them unwilling or unwanting to go indoors. So, even when they correct the housing problem, they&#x27;re still going to have the same problem on the streets.&quot; He has also been critical of certain aspects of the Lanterman–Petris–Short Act, in that it limits the ability of authorities to intervene when mentally ill persons are at risk of death due to being unable to care for their own needs. Pinsky said in an interview that he had correctly predicted a typhus outbreak in 2019 that occurred in the county as a result of rodents attracted to homeless encampments.

Pinsky was nominated to a local Los Angeles homeless commission by Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in April 2021. He faced criticism from local homeless right advocates and a Twitter campaign. While supervisor appointments to local boards are rarely controversial, more than 100 people submitted public comments asking supervisors not to approve Pinsky. The board received less than five public comments in support of his nomination. Critics claimed that Pinsky had overreported the number of homeless people with mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders. Others, such as homeless advocate and charity leader Rev. Andy Bales, defended Pinsky and called the hashtag campaign and public commenting an &quot;echo chamber&quot;. Pinsky&#x27;s nomination was ultimately withdrawn.

===Wellbutrin===

Pinsky has received criticism from several sources for alleged conflict of interest in his promotion of the drug Wellbutrin.

According to an October 2011 government complaint against GlaxoSmithKline, Pinsky was the recipient in 1999 of two payments totaling $275,000 from Glaxo Wellcome (a company that would later merge into GlaxoSmithKline) to promote the company&#x27;s drug Wellbutrin. Among other events, Pinsky made a 1999 appearance on the radio program &#x27;David Essel - Alive!&#x27;, discussing the sexual side effects of common SSRI medications and mentioned Wellbutrin as an example of depression medications that lack these side effects, (along with Serzone and Remeron, two medications from different manufacturers).

A transcript of this appearance and the invoice of the payment to Pinksy were later presented publicly as evidence during the criminal and civil actions against GlaxoSmithKline in 2012. In response to an inquiry from the Wall Street Journal about the case and specific physicians including Pinsky, the company declined to comment on their financial relationship with specific doctors, but acknowledged that &quot;during the period from January 1999 to December 2003, there were some occasions on which certain GSK sales representatives, speakers, and consultants promoted its antidepressant Wellbutrin to physicians for uses which were not FDA-approved in violation of federal law.&quot; Pinsky himself was not mentioned in the statement, and was never charged with wrongdoing by any court or medical ethics board. When asked about the topic, Pinsky stated:

==Personal life==
Pinsky married on July 21, 1991. He and his wife, Susan Sailer, had triplets Douglas, Jordan, and Paulina in November 1992.

Pinsky lives in Pasadena, California. Interested in fitness since his early teens, he goes running and does weight training regularly. In addition to his hobby of traveling, he also enjoys singing opera, as his mother was a professional singer. Pinsky stated on the June 24, 2009, episode of &quot;Loveline&quot; that at one point, he was torn between practicing medicine and becoming a professional opera singer. Pinsky stated that he auditioned for a celebrity singing show, but that the show passed on his appearance when he made it clear to producers that he could not sing pop songs but did perform an aria on &quot;Turn Ben Stein On&quot;.

Pinsky&#x27;s father, Morton, died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on October 27, 2009. A title card at the end of the season 3 finale of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; dedicated the episode to him. Pinsky&#x27;s mother, Helene, died on June 7, 2017, at age 91.

Pinsky is a nonobservant Jew; he admits to abandoning most Jewish practices but claims to retain a continued desire to learn about the religion. He explains that religious as well as philosophical studies affect his medical practice and his speeches, and that his background places &quot;an indirect coloring on every answer.&quot;

In September 2013, Pinsky stated that he had recovered from prostate cancer surgery performed earlier that June and July, after which Pinsky did not require chemotherapy or radiation. During episode 119 of his podcast Dr. Drew After Dark, aired on June 10, 2021, Pinsky said that his prostate cancer has recurred after it was discovered during routine bloodwork that his PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) level is elevated. He will go through Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in July 2021.

In a 2011 interview on &quot;Kevin and Bean&quot;, Pinsky stated he would speak to any media outlet including TMZ and &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; but would not speak to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, explaining &quot;They distort, and they mislead, and they take things out of context. I really am stunned at how shoddy their journalism is, so I stopped talking to them.&quot;

Politically, Pinsky considers himself libertarian, and has espoused more traditionally conservative views in recent years, such as the &#x27;tyranny&#x27; of governmental overreach and the need for a &quot;Liberty Party&quot;.

Pinsky told Ryan Holiday he was studying philosopher Epictetus and recommended it to him. Holiday says this sparked his interest in stoic philosophy, later becoming a New York Times best-selling author on the subject.

<doc id="337921" wikidata="Q1349227" url="?curid=337921" title="Academic dress">
<text>Academic dress is a traditional form of clothing for academic settings, mainly tertiary (and sometimes secondary) education, worn mainly by those who have obtained a university degree (or similar), or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities). It is also known as academical dress, academicals, or academic regalia.

Contemporarily, it is commonly seen only at graduation ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, and to a lesser degree in many ancient universities still is, worn daily. Today, the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consist of a gown (also known as a robe) with a separate hood, and usually a cap (generally either a square academic cap, a tam, or a bonnet). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain learned societies and institutions as official dress.

==Overview and history==

The academic dress found in most universities in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States is derived from that of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which was a development of academic and clerical dress common throughout the medieval universities of Europe. This overgarment had the practical purpose of keeping a scholar warm while they were sitting, immobile, or studying.

Formal or sober clothing is typically worn beneath the gown: for example, men would often wear a dark suit with a white shirt and a tie, or clerical clothing, military or civil uniform, or national dress, and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as &quot;subfusc&quot;) to be worn under the gown, though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and not what is worn beneath it, if unseen. In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States, with a few exceptions, it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original &quot;roba&quot;.

==Materials==
In general, the materials used for academic dress are heavily influenced by the climate where the academic institution is located, or the climate where the graduate will usually be wearing the costume (as a faculty member at another institution, for example). In either case, the American Council of Education (ACE) allows for the comfort of the wearer, and concedes that lighter materials be used in tropical climates, and heavier materials elsewhere. In addition, it acknowledges cotton poplin, broadcloth, rayon, or silk as appropriate.

The materials used for academic dress vary and range from the extremely economical to the very expensive. In the United States, most bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree candidates are often presented the &quot;souvenir&quot; version of regalia by their institutions or authorized vendor, which are generally intended for very few wearings and are comparatively very inexpensive. For some doctoral graduates, commencement will be the only time they wear academic regalia, and so they rent their gowns instead of buying them. These rented or hired gowns are often made of inexpensive polyester or other human-made synthetic fibre. In Britain, rented gowns are almost always polyester while Russell cord, silk, or artificial silk gowns are only available when bought. Undergraduate gowns are usually made from cotton or cotton and polyester mix and are relatively inexpensive to encourage students to own them.

People who choose to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, grosgrain, percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, broadcloth, Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types including artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, true silk, shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, or other forms of decoration.

In the past, fur has been used to line certain hoods (especially those of the UK) which range from rabbit to ermine. In the past, sheepskin was widely used. Most now use imitation fur, instead, mainly because of cost and animal rights concerns. Some robe makers use fur if the customer requests and pays for it, as some feel that the quality and feel of artificial fur has yet to match that of real fur.

Doctors&#x27; robes usually use wool flannel, panama wool (worsted), superfine cloth, damask, or brocade, and are brightly coloured (or black, but faced with a bright colour) to distinguish them from lower degrees. They tend to be the most expensive because they must be dyed in a specific colour and/or be trimmed in coloured silks. Many doctoral gowns have a special undress version, so adding to the cost of a full set.

Many institutions whose dress includes gowns of varying lengths prescribe the appropriate length of each gown with reference to parts of the wearer&#x27;s body (undergraduate gowns at Cambridge, for example, must not reach the knees, whereas BA gowns should reach just beyond them, according to the university&#x27;s statutes). As such, suppliers of academic dress produce gowns in many different sizes to fit persons of different heights.

==By country==
===Canada===


In Canada, academic regalia are worn by university officials, faculty, students, and honoured guests during Graduation exercises (commonly referred to as Convocation), installations of their presiding officers, and special convocations, such as the inauguration of newly endowed professorial chairs and inductions to some of the honour and professional societies with university chapters. Academic regalia typically consist of a headgear (mortarboard, Tudor bonnet, or John Knox cap), robe, and hood. Until the 1930s, Canadian universities customarily prescribed academic robes for its professors and students at classes and lectures. At the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto, academic gowns are still required for all students and faculty at Wednesday dinners, most college meetings, debates, and certain special college events.

Most Canadian universities follow or adopted either the British University academic dress at Oxford or Cambridge universities, or the Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume ratified by most American universities in the late 1890s. Other universities contain elements of the British and American patterns for some or all of their academic costumes. A classic example is the academic dress of McGill University, whose British origins are evident in the regalia of its degree holders. The distinctive ceremonial regalia of McGill University officials, though, are closer to the American pattern for the master&#x27;s robe with above-the-elbow, square, slit-cut sleeves. The scarlet, doctor of philosophy (PhD) regalia of McGill can now be worn closed-front, unlike the open-front only gown of the University of Cambridge higher doctoral full dress, from which it evolved. Gold strand tassels used in American doctoral regalia are wrapped around McGill&#x27;s otherwise Tudor-style bonnet or tam.

===France===
In France, academic dress, also called the &quot;toge&quot; (from the word &quot;toga&quot;, an ancient Roman garment), is similar to French judges&#x27; court dress, except for its colour, which depends on the academic field in which the wearer graduated. It is nowadays little worn, except by doctors during the opening of the university year or the ceremony for a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot;. For doctors, it consists of:
* A long gown (a bit similar to a cassock) with a long row of buttons (traditionally, 33, but nowadays usually fewer) in front and a train at the back (which in the current costume is not visible but attached with a button in the inner side of the gown). The gown is in two colours: black and the standard colour of the academic field in which the wearer graduated (see below), with simars (two vertical bands in the front of the gown).
* An &quot;épitoge&quot; (epitoga): A piece of cloth with white fur stripes (three for doctors) attached by a button on the left shoulder, with a rectangular, long, thin tail in the front and a triangular, shorter, broad tail in the back (both tails carry the fur stripes); its colour is that of the relevant academic field. The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.
* A long, wide belt or sash, either black or of the colour of the relevant academic field, ended by fringes (which may be golden or of the same colour as the belt), and attached with a broad, ornamental knot.
* A white &quot;rabat&quot; (jabot), over which a white tie may be worn for ceremonial occasions: It is made of lace for the dean of the faculty, the president of the university, and a few other officials, of plain cotton for others.
* Traditionally only for men, a mortarboard of the colour of the relevant academic field with a golden stripe, which is usually not worn but carried (since the academic dress in France is rarely worn outdoors, and men are not supposed to wear hats indoors), and often even omitted. Nowadays the practice is more relaxed, and the mortarboard is sometimes seen worn by women or worn indoor by men.
* In principle, a white bow tie (for men only ; quite rarely seen) and white gloves (nowadays never used).

Professors who served 20 years are sometimes presented with a sword (identical model to that of French police commissars).

The colours of the various academic fields are daffodil (yellow) for literature and arts, amaranth (purplish red) for science, redcurrant (reddish pink) for medicine, scarlet red for law, and violet (purple) for theology. University rectors, chancellors or presidents wear also specific costumes, which are violet regardless of the academic field in which they graduated.

The dress exists in two versions: the &quot;petit costume&quot; (&quot;small costume&quot;) and the &quot;grand costume&quot; (&quot;great costume&quot;). Both are identical in form, and differ only in the presence or absence of the mortarboard and the repartition of colours on the gown and sash (the other elements of the dress, especially the epitoga, being identical for both):
* for the &quot;petit costume&quot;, the gown is all black, except the simarras which are of the colour of the academic field; the buttons are black; the sash and its fringes moiré black; the mortarboard is usually not worn;
* for the &quot;grand costume&quot;, the gown is black between the simarras, which are moiré black, and of the colour of the academic field on the sides and on the sleeves, except their turn-ups, which are black; the buttons are of the colour of the academic field; the sash is of the colour of the academic field, its fringes may be either the same colour or gold.

In formal occasions, the &quot;grand costume&quot; is equivalent to white tie, whereas the &quot;petit costume&quot; is equivalent to black tie.

===Germany===
German academic dress generally consists of gown and cap. Nowadays, if in use at all, it is only found at special occasions, such as public processions, inaugurations of rectors, and graduation ceremonies. Historically, only the rectors, deans, professors, and lecturers wore academic dress—not students or graduates. Each German university had its own system of colours and drapings to signify faculty membership and position in the university hierarchy.

The gown of the German academic dress is called &quot;Talar&quot; (with the accent on the second &quot;a&quot;: talár; from Latin &quot;talare&quot; which means &quot;to the ankles&quot;). It can be traced back to the everyday clothes of the scholars in the Middle Ages. The same word &quot;Talar&quot; is also used for the robes of Protestant (Lutheran) pastors and rabbis (not for judges or lawyers, their gowns are called &quot;Robe&quot;), although these gowns often differ more or less in cut, length, drapings, and sometimes even in colour (the gowns of the German Supreme Court are, e.g., completely dark red).

The professorial &quot;Talar&quot; can be described as a long black gown with wide sleeves, often with lapels in faculty colour, while deans wear a &quot;Talar&quot; completely in faculty colour. Rectors typically have a distinguished, more elaborate &quot;Talar&quot;, e.g., made of velvet, coloured in red, or with gold embroidery. At some universities, the rector additionally wears a chain of office and, at some occasions, carries a scepter. The cap that accompanies the &quot;Talar&quot; is called &quot;Barett&quot;. As is the case with the &quot;Talar&quot;, which type of cap is used varies by university as well. Historically, caps made of soft materials rather than the square academic cap are common. The colour of the &quot;Barett&quot; matches the &quot;Talar&quot;.

After the German student movement, following the years of 1967 all West German universities dropped their academic dress because they were identified with right-winged conservatism and reactionism by the partly socialist influenced students at that time: The famous slogan &quot;Unter den Talaren – Muff von 1000 Jahren&quot; (&quot;beneath the gowns the fug of 1000 years&quot;) refers not to the old traditions of the Middle Ages, but especially to the Nazi regime and their self-declared &quot;empire of 1000 years&quot;. In East Germany, which was a communist one-party state, &quot;Talare&quot; were abolished by law at about the same time. After East Germany began to dissolve in 1989, several universities, particularly University of Rostock, University of Greifswald, University of Jena, and University of Halle-Wittenberg, resurrected lost traditions including the &quot;Talar&quot; for officials. Some traditional universities in West German states have since followed, such as University of Heidelberg.

Since 2005, some universities introduced centrally organized graduation ceremonies for students of all faculties where academic dress is worn, most notably University of Bonn, Chemnitz University of Technology, and RWTH Aachen (only cap and stole). The graduates&#x27; dress usually consists of a simple black gown, a square academic cap, and possibly a stole in faculty colour. At most other universities, faculties are responsible for organizing graduation ceremonies individually. Some faculties have decided for wearing academic dress at their ceremonies as well, e.g., the Faculty of Law at University of Marburg and the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Goethe University Frankfurt. This practice is commonly understood as following Anglo-American examples rather than reviving old traditions.

=== India ===

Indian universities followed United Kingdom robe and gown system until 2013 when Banaras Hindu University replaced it with Indian traditional dress of Kurta, Dhoti, Pyajama for men and Saree for women, which led to students at other universities demanding similar dresses. Slowly Indian universities started replacing the robes and gowns with traditional dresses. In 2019, India&#x27;s University Grants Commission formally issued a circular to all public and private universities to opt for Indian traditional dress made of Indian handloom.

Indian universities today prescribe Kurta, Pyajama for male students and Saree or Salwar Suit for women.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, academic regalia, also called a &quot;toga&quot; is only worn in graduation ceremonies. An Indonesian toga generally comes in three pieces of clothing: a gown, a cape or a hood, and a cap with tassel (pentagon-shaped mortarboard/bonnet). Other items are also worn during graduation ceremony such as a medallion, tippet or academic stole.

There are four elements in Indonesian academic regalia:
* Gown – Indonesian academic gowns commonly come in black with a different color of trimming according to the field of study/faculty. In general they are long gowns with bell sleeves. There are some distinctive differences for each academic degree: for example, the length of undergraduate gown is usually below knee; for master&#x27;s degrees, the gown is longer than undergraduate; and for doctoral degrees, the gown has a velvet panel (or velour for fabric substitution) on the front and sleeve.
* Cape or Hood – In most universities capes are commonly used for undergraduates/bachelor&#x27;s degree students, meanwhile hoods are commonly used for graduate students (master&#x27;s/doctoral) and academic staff. A cape/hood is also colour-coded according to the field of study/faculty.
* Cap – For undergraduate and master&#x27;s degrees a mortarboard is worn. Unlike most academic caps, which are square in shape, the Indonesian cap is usually pentagonal. Another type of cap like Tudor bonnet is generally worn by doctoral students, although in some universities like Padjadjaran University the bonnet is worn for all academic degrees.
* Tassel – In most universities, before the commencement ceremony, undergraduates&#x27; tassel are placed on the left position, and during the graduation procession students receive their degree scroll/diploma and then move their tassel to the right. Tassels are also color-coded.

===Italy===

In Italy there are several differences among the typical academic dress (gowns, academic caps, etc.) of the different universities, due to the great number of ancient universities in the country (for example the University of Bologna, University of Pavia, University of Padua, University of Pisa, University of Siena, University of Florence, University of Rome, etc.). Usually gowns are worn only by professors during ceremonies and, in some faculties, during graduations. After the student protests of 1968 many professors in many universities had stopped wearing academical gowns also in the formal occasions but since the 1990s people have started to use them again, mostly in humanities faculties. Furthermore, also students have started to wear gowns and cap in graduation ceremonies (usually for PhD) in some universities. Gowns are traditionally all hemmed with the colours of faculty, which have some variations following the tradition of each atheneum. However the most widely used table of colours is the following

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, most public university academic gowns incorporate Songket motifs, apart from being influenced by the academic dress system in the United Kingdom which incorporates Tudor bonnets for doctorates and mortarboard for master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degree holders. For instance, the academic dress of the University of Malaya is based on the academic dress of the University of Oxford, which the academic dress for bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree and doctorate are inspired from those of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy respectively. Some university chancellors who were royal heads of state usually incorporates yellow-colour academic gown to denote their royal status. Certain universities, especially Universiti Teknologi MARA, Universiti Utara Malaysia, National Defence University of Malaysia and Universiti Malaysia Kelantan includes an academic sash as academic regalia specifically for first class bachelor&#x27;s degree holders. However, academic dresses are rarely worn and usually worn during convocation ceremonies, professorship lectures. and inanugration ceremonies. The colours denoting faculties vary according to each institution and do not have a uniformed colour code. 

===Netherlands===

At Dutch universities, academic dress does not come with a degree but with the incumbency of a professorial chair: only full, chaired professors wear the &quot;toga&quot; with bib and beret. The beret is usually a soft cap, square or round and made of velvet; the gown (ankle-length, open in the front), is made of wool trimmed with velvet or silk It is traditionally black, as in the robes of early-modern humanists; some universities have gowns with wide slashed sleeves edged in faculty-specific colours, others have a decorated sleeve but without specific faculty colours. Recently established universities may show a greater variety of colours.

Academic dress is only worn on ceremonial occasions: the university anniversary or &quot;dies natalis&quot;, inaugural lectures, and the public defence of a doctoral thesis. On such occasions, the assembled professors line up as a &quot;cortège&quot; headed by the university beadle, who also wears an academic gown and carries the university&#x27;s mace. Male professors remove their beret when sitting down and put it on when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence). Female professors may keep the beret on at all times.

Academic dress may be completed by a chain of office (for the presiding Rector or Dean) or the insignia of honorary doctorates or royal orders (only worn at the &quot;dies natalis&quot;).

===New Zealand===
University graduates in New Zealand wear an academic gown identical to those of the University of Cambridge and either a hood or scarf, depending on whether the graduate is receiving a degree or diploma. If the graduate is receiving a degree, a hood will be worn throughout the ceremony. If a diploma is received, the graduate will wear a diploma scarf.

The hood, like the gown, is identical to that of the hood for the Cambridge Master of Arts. A bachelor&#x27;s degree hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white fur (the exception to this are Canterbury and Waikato University which do not line their hoods with fur). The bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white satin. The master&#x27;s degree hood has no edging. A doctoral degree recipient wears the same as a graduate receiving a master&#x27;s degree, except the gown is completely silk, either black or scarlet, with the option to wear a cloth gown. A Doctoral hood is completely silk and the headdress is a black Tudor bonnet, in place of the flat-topped mortarboard worn with bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s gowns.

Academic dress is rarely worn in New Zealand other than at formal academic events, such as by graduates and faculty at graduation ceremonies and teaching faculty at school prizegivings. Some traditional boys&#x27; high schools retain the tradition of the headmaster wearing a gown while leading assemblies. Undergraduates who live at College House at the University of Canterbury must wear academic dress to dinner.

It is common for graduands to wear clothing or adornments significant to their culture at their graduation ceremony. For example, it is common to see Māori students wearing a traditional cloak known as &quot;korowai&quot; or &quot;kakahu huruhuru&quot; or Pasifika students wearing lavalava, ta&#x27;ovala and elaborate lei.

Below is a list of the general hood colours of graduates:

===Philippines===
Most colleges and universities in the Philippines follow the traditional mortarboard, hood and gown during graduation.

In some schools of the country, the colour of the gown corresponds to the school colour (Blue for Colegio de San Juan de Letran and Ateneo de Manila University, Green for Far Eastern University, and Red for San Beda University).

Some schools, like the University of Santo Tomas, due to their Spanish heritage, follow Spanish academic attire such as the academic biretta and mozetta. The biretta and mozetta are worn by those from the Graduate School and the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. Graduates of the bachelor&#x27;s programs wear the traditional mortarboard, hood and gown. The professors of the university wear their academic regalia during the Missa de Apertura or the Opening Mass of the Academic Year aside from Solemn Investitures (graduation ceremonies) and other academic activities. The academic colours are unique to this university as these depend on the official color of the faculty or college a student or an academe belongs into.

A unique graduation garb worn at member universities of the University of the Philippines System is the use of the &quot;Sablay&quot;. The &quot;Sablay&quot; was inspired from the Malong of Muslim Mindanao, giving it a Filipiniana look. It features the indigenous baybayin characters for &quot;U&quot; and &quot;P&quot;. During the commencement ceremony, graduates wear the &quot;Sablay&quot; at the right shoulder, it is then moved to the left shoulder after the President of the university confers their degree, &quot;similar to the moving of the tassel of the academic cap.&quot; The &quot;Sablay&quot; is worn over traditional Filipino attire – barong tagalog for men and Filipiniana dress for women. The garb was first worn at the University of the Philippines Diliman. Other UP campuses followed suit.

Elementary and high school students also wear a certain kind of academic dress upon their graduation, usually a white gown and mortarboard for public schools. For private schools, the gown and mortarboard&#x27;s color is at the discretion of the administration. There are several schools which make use of a hood-like design on top of their gowns which bears the school colors.

===Poland===

The wearing of traditional academic dress is an important feature of Polish educational ceremonies.

===Portugal===

Academic dress varies from university to university. In some situations, such as in doctoral exams, the hat is not used.
In Portugal, following an ancient tradition, university regular students also use a specific dressing. The &quot;traje académico&quot;, as it is known in Portuguese, is recognized by its almost totally black color and cape. But other student dresses did exist, including the unique blue attire of the students of the University of Algarve (UAlg) in use until at least to the 2010s.

===Singapore===

===South Africa===
Academic dress in South Africa varies from one institution to another, but generally follow UK patterns. A common distinction is for graduands in all degrees up to and including the master&#x27;s degree to have black gowns, while the PhD candidate wears a scarlet gown. These days, academic dress is only used at graduation ceremonies. The wearing of traditional African attire, or modern clothes inspired by traditional attire, beneath the academic dress has been a distinct trend in recent years.

===Spain===
The typical Spanish academic dress has Latin origin. It has been regulated since 1850, when Queen Isabella II established several rules about academic dress, according to the centuries-old Spanish custom. The typical Spanish academic dress for doctors is composed by:
* A black long gown (&quot;toga&quot;) with a long row of buttons, made of satin and wool. It is worn over a black suit.
* A mozzetta (&quot;muceta&quot;), whose colour depends on the academic field.
* Long cuffs (&quot;puñetas&quot;) of the same fabric and color than the mozetta, covered by white cotton lace. Those of the &quot;Rector&quot; (University president) are bright red or pink, and the lace is usually silken. The buttons are made of gold for the Rector and made of silver for the Deans.
* An octagonal, tasseled biretta (&quot;birrete&quot;), whose colour depends on the academic field. Tassels of doctors holding more than one degree in separate fields alternate the corresponding colors.
* White gloves.
* A ring is usually worn by doctors.
* A staff or scepter (&quot;bastón&quot;) made of American reed is carried by the university rector.
* Medallions are often worn by postgraduates, doctors, professors, deans and the university rector.
However, this academic dress is only used for the opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates &quot;honoris causa&quot;. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a mortarboard and a mozzetta (&quot;muceta&quot;) or a sash over the shoulder (&quot;beca&quot;) with the shield of the university and/or faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.

The colours used in Spain for the various academic fields are:


===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the academic dress consists of gown, hood (post-graduate) and a garland (on graduation day). Universities that were affiliated to the former University of Ceylon issue black gowns for graduates and post graduates; red gowns for master&#x27;s and PhD graduates; crimson gowns for chancellors with a different colour gowns for senior academic faculty. These universities only issue garland on the graduation day to new graduates and only issue mortar boards to chancellor, vice chancellor and registrars. Private universities issue mortar boards to graduates along with a hood in place of garland.

===Sweden and Finland===

Finland and Sweden have similar traditions when it comes to academic clothing. For important academic ceremonies white tie is usually worn, however, often with traditional headwear and gowns. Gowns are not generally used except by the rector as a symbol of office, if anyone.

The regular student cap (Finnish: &quot;ylioppilaslakki&quot;, Swedish: &quot;studentmössa&quot;) usually has a white velvet crown, a black band and a black beak. The cap can be worn by anyone who has passed the matriculation examination and is acceptable wear for both formal and informal academic celebrations. Technology students wear a special kind of student cap called a &quot;teekkarilakki&quot; (Finnish) or &quot;teknologmössa&quot; (Swedish). It is similar to the traditional student cap, but features a tuft and a distinctive cockade to show which university the wearer is attending. Technology students generally wear their caps more frequently, and thus the tuft often symbolizes university engineering students. Although universities have different rules regarding the use of the cap, caps are generally not awarded to students until the completion of the first year of studies. The technology student&#x27;s hat may also be seen on informal occasions, being worn with the student overall at many universities.

In both countries many universities have doctoral hats for persons who have completed a PhD or similar degree. These usually resemble top hats and must be worn with white tie. Like other hats, they are not generally worn indoors, but they may be presented on a table. Events where the hat and white tie are worn include thesis defences, post-doctoral parties, ceremonial conferments of degrees, opening ceremonies and other formal ceremonies related to the university. At some universities, a doctoral ring is awarded together with the hat. In the Ingmar Bergman film &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, one scene shows the conferral of a Jubilee doctor degree on the main character at the University of Lund, which includes the presentation of such a hat and ring. At the University of Helsinki a cape and a sword are commonly worn with the doctoral hat. Students of the student organization &quot;Limes&quot; may also be seen wearing a black cape.

===Taiwan===

Academic dress varies from university to university in Taiwan, generally consisting of cap and gown. Its use is limited to such special occasions as graduation ceremonies.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, there are five different styles of academic dress: (1) traditional Thai, (2) traditional American, (3) French (Paris), (4) modified American, and (5) modified British.

Some universities prefer a traditional robe originated in the royal court, known as suea khrui. Traditionally, the robe is a one-piece open-fronted garment made with a mesh, faced and bordered with a velvet or felt band. Since the conception of Chulalongkorn University, the traditional suea khrui was adopted for their graduates. Influenced by the colour of gowns used at Oxford, bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s gown are faced and bordered with a black felt band. Meanwhile, a scarlet felt band is reserved for doctors. There are patterns upon the felt band to denote different degrees and faculties. Other universities that utilise the traditional robe might, instead of a mesh, use another kind of fabric for their dress.

Other universities in Thailand that use a traditional robe include
* Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai;
* Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Nonthaburi;
* Khon Kaen University;
* Naresuan University, Phitsanulok;
* Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya;
* Mahamakut Buddhist University, Nakhon Pathom;
* All King Mongkut&#x27;s Universities of Technology;
* Most Rajabhat Universities and all Rajamangala universities of technology.

As a note, Mahachulalongkorn and Mahamakut Buddhist universities do not prescribe an academic dress for monks, nuns and clergymen. It is also customary that monks and ministers of religion do not wear a dress, when they are being admitted to the degree at other Thai universities.

Other universities employs academic dress of the modified American pattern, with the exception at Thammasat University and Kasetsart University. Thammasat University employs a plain black gown with different epitoge, a strip of cloth worn over the left shoulder, for distinct degrees. The number of fur bands upon the epitoge indicates the degree (i.e. 3 for doctorate, 2 for master&#x27;s and 1 for bachelor&#x27;s). The hat is not worn. Kasetsart University, on the other hand, retains the original American academic dress style. For bachelor&#x27;s, the dress comprises a plain sleeve gown with a coloured cord around the neck. This is different from many American universities, at which a scarf is used instead of a cord. Master&#x27;s gown exactly follows the American design. The sleeve is sewn shut at the end, with a slit to free the arm. Doctors&#x27; gown also follows the American tradition. The sleeve has three velvet bars to denote the seniority. The hat is included.

Since most Thai universities do not fully understand the original American tradition, they usually use an American doctoral gown for their doctoral degree. By reducing the number of velvet bars on the sleeve, it is possible to get gowns for master&#x27;s (2 bars) and bachelor&#x27;s (1 bar or none). Notable examples of this deviation include Ramkhamhaeng University, Burapha University, Mahidol University and the University of Phayao. Some universities even incorporate the hood into a pattern on the gown, including Suranaree University of Technology and Walailak University. This eliminates the need of additional hood.

Prince of Songkhla University uses a gown which is heavily deviated from the original British style. Gowns for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s are made of black stuff. Doctoral gowns are made from scarlet cloth. Instead of being open-fronted like ones in the United Kingdom and Australia, all gowns are close-fronted, probably due to the robemakers. The neckband is curved instead of being a chevron. Silpakorn University mixes a modified American gown (i.e. a close-fronted black gown with different number of bars on the sleeve) with an altered version of Oxford simple hood.

===Tunisia===
In Tunisia, University of Ez-Zitouna graduates wear an academic gown. Doctoral graduates in Islamic Sciences wear a jebba. In other Tunisian universities, like the medical university, doctoral graduates wear an academic dress.
===Turkey===

Academic regalia in Turkey has many similarities with the academic dress traditions of the United States.
===United Kingdom and Ireland===

There is a distinction between different types of academical dress. Most recently, gowns, hoods and caps are categorised into their shapes and patterns by the Groves classification system, which is based on Nicholas Groves&#x27; document, &quot;Hood and Gown Patterns&quot;. This lists the various styles or patterns of academic dress and assigns them a code or a Groves Classification Number. For example, the Cambridge BA style gown is designated [b2] and a hood in the Cambridge full-shape is designated [f1], etc. Because the universities are free to design their own academicals using a wide range of available gown, hood and cap patterns, colours and materials at their and the robemaker&#x27;s disposal, the academicals of two given universities rarely clash with each other.

The Burgon Society was founded in 2000 to promote the study of academic dress. Its publications and activities examine the history and current use of academic dress. In 2011 it published the third edition of Shaw&#x27;s reference book on British and Irish academical dress. The Society hosts a conference each spring at which recent research is presented.

The modern gown is derived from the &quot;roba&quot; worn under the &quot;cappa clausa&quot;, a garment resembling a long black cape. In early medieval times, all students at the universities were in at least minor orders, and were required to wear the &quot;cappa&quot; or other clerical dress, and restricted to clothes of black or other dark colour. The gowns most commonly worn, that of the clerical type gowns of bachelor&#x27;s degrees (BA and BS) and master&#x27;s degrees (MA and MS), are substantially the same throughout the English-speaking world. All are traditionally made of black cloth, (although occasionally the gown is dyed in one of the university&#x27;s colours) and the material at the back of the gown is gathered into a yoke. The bachelor&#x27;s gown has bell-shaped sleeves, while the master&#x27;s gown has long sleeves closed at the end, with the arm passing through a slit above the elbow.

There are two distinctive shapes used in the UK for doctors&#x27; gowns; the Oxford doctor&#x27;s shape and the Cambridge doctor&#x27;s shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge Doctor of Music dress gown which is a pattern between the two. The other form of doctor&#x27;s gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; however, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn.

Undergraduates at many older universities also wear gowns; the most common essentially a smaller knee-length version of the bachelor&#x27;s gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is a sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford. At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown. Undergraduates at St Andrews, with the exception of theology students, commonly wear scarlet woollen gowns with velvet collars. Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities.

Another form of dress, now rarely seen, is the habit, which is worn over a black gown. Only Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Newcastle use habits and mainly reserve their use for very formal ceremonial occasions and to a specific group of academics or officials.

The hood was originally a functional garment, worn to shield the head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions. Hoods comprise two basic patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood consists of a cape, cowl, and liripipe, as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe. The colour and lining of hoods in academic dress represent the rank and/or faculty of the wearer. In many Commonwealth universities, bachelor&#x27;s hoods are worn with edges or linings of white rabbit fur, while master&#x27;s hoods are lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive fur). Doctoral hoods are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk. Faculty colours were introduced by the University of London and many universities followed suit.

The academic cap or square, commonly known as the mortarboard, has come to be symbolic of academia. In some universities it can be worn by graduates and undergraduates alike. It is a hat consisting of a skullcap surmounted by a flat square of stiffened cloth, the board; a tassel is fixed to a button in the centre of the board. The mortarboard may also be referred to as a trencher cap (or simply trencher). The tassel is composed of a cluster of silk threads which are wrapped together with a cord which is attached to the button affixed to the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are plaited together to form a cord with the end threads left untied. In many universities, holders of doctorates wear a soft-crowned, round-brimmed headpiece known as a Tudor bonnet or tam, rather than a trencher. Other types of hats used, especially in some universities in the UK, are the John Knox cap (mostly at Scottish universities), the Bishop Andrewes cap (a reinvention of the ancient form of the mortarboard, worn by Cambridge Doctors of Divinity DD&#x27;s) and the pileus (at Sussex). In some universities, such as Oxford, women may wear an Oxford ladies&#x27; cap.

Officers of the universities generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver lace and frogs. They wear a velvet mortarboard, similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel. Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet &quot;cappa clausa&quot; or cope worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by Doctors of Divinity. In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes like that of the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.

At degree ceremonies, graduands often dress in the academic dress of the degree to which they are about to be admitted prior to the actual graduation ceremony. This is not the case at several of the older universities in the UK, most notably, Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews which have their own distinct traditions.

In addition to universities and colleges, a number of British professional bodies, such as the Institute of Biology and the Institute of Physics grant academic dress to their members.

===United States===

Academic regalia in the United States has been influenced by the academic dress traditions of Europe. There is an Inter-Collegiate code which sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia followed by most, though some institutions do not adhere to it entirely, and fewer still ignore it. Generally, academic regalia in the United States consists of a mortarboard cap affixed with a tassel, and gown worn over other clothing. The ensemble can also be adorned with an academic stole—a vestment used by various organizations to denote academic achievement.
The practice of wearing academic regalia in the United States dates to the Colonial Colleges period, and was heavily influenced by European practices and styles. Students of most colonial colleges were required to wear the &quot;college habit&quot; at most times – a practice that lasted until the eve of the American Civil War in many institutions of higher learning. In some rare instances the practice has persisted, such as at , where members of the student honor society, along with most professors, continue to wear the gown to class. After the Civil War, academic regalia was generally only worn at ceremonies or when representing the institution. There was not, however, any standardization among the meanings behind the various costumes. In 1893, an Intercollegiate Commission made up of representatives from leading institutions and chaired by President of Columbia Seth Low was created, to establish an acceptable system of academic dress. The commission met at Columbia University in 1895 and adopted a code of academic regalia, which prescribed the cut and style and materials of the gowns, as well as determined the colors which were to represent the different fields of learning. These rules were soon adopted by Columbia&#x27;s peer institutions, including Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. In 1932 the American Council on Education (ACE) authorized the appointment of a committee to determine whether revision and completion of the academic code adopted by the conference of the colleges and universities in 1895 is desirable at this time, and, if so, to draft a revised code and present a plan for submitting the code to the consideration of the institutional members of the council.

The committee reviewed the situation and approved a code for academic costumes that has been in effect since that year. A &quot;Committee on Academic Costumes and Ceremonies&quot;, appointed by the American Council on Education in 1959, again reviewed the academic dress code and made several changes.

Although academic dress is now rarely worn outside commencement ceremonies or other academic rituals such as encaenia in the U.S., graduation ceremonies have gained popularity and have expanded from high school graduations to middle school, elementary school and kindergarten graduation ceremonies.

Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s gowns in the United States are similar to their counterparts in the United Kingdom, though bachelor&#x27;s gowns are now designed to be worn closed, and all are at least mid-calf length to ankle-length. The master&#x27;s gown sleeve is oblong and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down in the typical manner, it is square cut at the rear part of the oblong shape. The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening, but the rest of the arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut liripipe incorporated into many academic hoods (&quot;see&quot;, below). The master&#x27;s gown is designed to be worn open or closed.

Doctoral robes are typically black, although some schools use robes in the school&#x27;s colours. The Code calls for the outside shell of the hood (&quot;see&quot;, below) to remain black in that case, however. In general, doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by bachelor&#x27;s graduates, with the addition of three velvet bands on the sleeves and velvet facing running down the front of the gown. The Code calls for the gown trim to be either black or the colour designated for the field of study in which the doctorate was earned (see &quot;Inter-Collegiate colors&quot;). However, in the case of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), although it is awarded for study in any number of fields, the dark blue velvet of philosophy is always used regardless of the particular field studied. For example, if not choosing black trim, a PhD in theology would wear velvet gown trim in dark blue, while a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) would wear scarlet trim, if not choosing black. The robes have full sleeves, instead of the bell sleeves of the bachelor&#x27;s gown. Some gowns expose a necktie or cravat when closed, while others take an almost cape-like form. It is designed to be worn open or closed in the front.

The Code calls for the shell material of the hood to match the robe, and for the colour to be black regardless of the colour of the robe being worn. The interior lining – generally silk – displays the colours of the institution from which the wearer received the degree, in a pattern prescribed by it (usually, if more than one colour is used, chevrons or equal divisions). The opening of the hood is trimmed in velvet or velveteen. In most American colleges and universities, the colour of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field – or as closely related as possible – to which the degree earned pertains (see &quot;Inter-Collegiate colors&quot;). Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have dispensed with the bachelor&#x27;s hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.

Headwear is an important component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear will vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution&#x27;s specifications. For caps, the mortarboard is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown. The exception—velvet—is reserved for the doctor&#x27;s degree only, seen in the form of a multiple-sided (4, 6, or 8) tam, but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here. The only colour called for is black, in all cases. The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems to provide, by tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress. It has been black, or represented the university&#x27;s colours, or the colours of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national honour societies or other awards. There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind. For doctoral and master&#x27;s students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.

The colours allocated to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its &quot;Academic Costume Code.&quot; Some of the more common colours seen are that liberal arts is represented by white, science by golden yellow, medicine by green, law by purple, theology by scarlet, and philosophy (including all PhD degrees) by dark blue. A distinction is made in the code, which calls for a graduate to display the colour of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself. For example, if a graduate is awarded a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree specifically in business the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; the same method is true of master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates. However, in 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the following sentence clarifying the use of the colour dark blue for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is awarded in any number of fields: &quot;In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree, the dark blue colour is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy.&quot;

A number of other items such as cords, stoles, aiguillettes, etc. representing various academic achievements or other honours are also worn at the discretion of some degree-granting institutions. Technically, however, the ACE code does not allow their use on or over academic regalia.

==Pontifical universities==
Academic dress for pontifical universities tends to vary by the host country. Traditionally, for doctors of a pontifical university or faculty &quot;the principal mark of a Doctor&#x27;s dignity is the four horned biretta.&quot; Under the old Code of Canon Law, in commencement ceremonies and other academic settings, doctors from pontifical faculties and universities had a canonical right to wear the doctoral biretta, as stated in can. 1378, and explained in commentary 262 of the Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici as follows:
There is no equivalent canon in the current Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1983, but the tradition remains.

The Sartoria Gammerelli offers, in line with the updated stipulations of the Pontifical Gregorian University, birettas lined with the following assorted piping and tufts depending on which faculty one is graduated from: Green for Canon Law, Red for Sacred Theology, Blue for Philosophy, and Orange for Social Sciences. Three-horned birettas are to be used by Licentiates, four-horned for Doctors.

Academic dress for the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; graduates consists of a black toga or academic gown with trim to follow the color of the faculty, and an academic ring. For the doctoral degree a four corned biretta is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned biretta is to be worn. See: Academic regalia of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas. The &#x27;traditional&#x27; biretta at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, is white, to correspond to the white Dominican habit. Also, the academic senate of the &quot;Angelicum&quot; in its May 2011 meeting indicated that the black biretta may be used with trim and pom in the color of the particular faculty.

A three-peaked black biretta with appropriately colored piping may be similarly used by those receiving the licentiate degree (S.T.L., Ph.L.).

<doc id="337961" wikidata="Q5020823" url="?curid=337961" title="2002 California Proposition 50">
<text>Proposition 50 was a proposition in the state of California on the November 5, 2002 ballot. The proposition passed with 3,808,594 (55.4%) votes in favor and 3,076,333 (44.6%) against. It was placed on the ballot through the initiative process.

When put on the ballot, the question before voters was:
== Official summary ==
The passing of California Proposition 50 would allow:
*3,440,000,000 general obligation bonds to fund a variety of water projects, including:
**Specified CALFED Bay-Delta Program projects including urban and agricultural water use efficiency projects
**Grants and loans to reduce Colorado River water use
**Purchasing, protecting and restoring coastal wetlands near urban areas
**Competitive grants for water management and quality improvement projects
**Development of river parkways
**Improved security for state, local and regional water systems
**Grants for desalination and drinking water disinfection
*Appropriates money from state General Fund to pay off bonds

==State and Local Government==
The passing of California Proposition 50 resulted in a cost of up to $6.9 billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal ($3.44 billion) and interest ($3.46 billion) costs on the bonds at a state level. This will consist of payments of about $230 million per year. It would also cause a reduction in local property tax revenues, ranging from a few million dollars to roughly $10 million annually, about one-half of which would be off-set by state payments to schools to make up their revenue loss. It had unknown costs to state and local governments to operate or maintain the properties or projects purchased or developed with the bond funds.

<doc id="337963" wikidata="Q945633" url="?curid=337963" title="George Benjamin (composer)">
<text>Sir George William John Benjamin, CBE (born 31 January 1960) is an English composer, conductor, pianist and teacher.

==Biography==
Benjamin was born in London and attended Westminster School. He studied piano privately with Marguerite Tury from 1967–1974. He wrote his first composition at the age of nine, and took piano and composition lessons with Peter Gellhorn until age 15, after which Gellhorn arranged for Benjamin to continue his lessons in Paris with Olivier Messiaen, whom he had known for many years. Messiaen was reported to have described Benjamin as his favourite pupil. He then read music at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, studying under Alexander Goehr and Robin Holloway.

Benjamin&#x27;s orchestral piece &quot;Ringed by the Flat Horizon&quot; (written for the Cambridge University Musical Society and premiered in Cambridge under the baton of Mark Elder on 5 March 1980) was performed at The Proms that August, while he was still a student, making him the then-youngest living composer to have had music performed at the Proms. The London Sinfonietta and Sir Simon Rattle premiered &quot;At First Light&quot; two years later. &quot;Antara&quot; was commissioned by IRCAM for the 10th anniversary of the Pompidou Centre in 1987 and &quot;Three Inventions for chamber orchestra&quot; were written for the 75th Salzburg Festival in 1995. The London Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Boulez premiered &quot;Palimpsests&quot; in 2002 to mark the opening of ‘By George’, a season-long portrait which included the first performance of &quot;Shadowlines&quot; by Pierre-Laurent Aimard. More recent celebrations of Benjamin&#x27;s work have taken place at Southbank Centre in 2012 (as part of the UK&#x27;s Cultural Olympiad) and at the Barbican in 2016.

Benjamin has composed four operas, all with librettos by Martin Crimp. Their first operatic work was &quot;Into the Little Hill&quot;, commissioned in 2006 by the Festival d&#x27;Automne in Paris. It received its London premiere at the Royal Opera House in February 2009. Their second collaboration, &quot;Written on Skin&quot;, premiered at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 2012. Benjamin conducted the UK premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in March 2013. &quot;Lessons in Love and Violence&quot;, their third collaboration over the period 2015–2017, premiered at the Royal Opera House in 2018. Their fourth opera collaboration, &quot;Picture a Day like this&quot;, was commissioned by and first produced at the Aix Festival at the Théâtre du Jeu de Paume in 2023; Benjamin conducted with Marianne Crebassa as the woman.

As a conductor, Benjamin made his operatic debut in 1999 conducting &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; at La Monnaie, Brussels, and he has conducted numerous world premieres, including works by Wolfgang Rihm, Unsuk Chin, Gérard Grisey, and György Ligeti. In 1993, he curated the first Meltdown music festival in London and in 2010 he was the Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival in California. For the 2018–2019 season, Benjamin was composer-in-residence with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In January 2025, the London Philharmonic Orchestra announced the appointment of Benjamin as its next composer-in-residence, effective September 2025.

For sixteen years, Benjamin taught composition at the Royal College of Music, London, where he became the first Prince Consort Professor of Composition before succeeding Sir Harrison Birtwistle as Henry Purcell Professor of Composition at King&#x27;s College London in January 2001. His pupils include Luke Bedford, Robin de Raaff, and Dai Fujikura.

==Honours==
In 2019, Benjamin was awarded the Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale. Other awards include the 2001 Arnold Schönberg Prize, the 2015 Prince Pierre of Monaco composition prize (for his opera &quot;Written on Skin&quot;), and 2023 the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. In 2022, Benjamin received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Works Collection. For 2023, he received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award.

In 2019, critics at &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Written on Skin&quot; as the second best work of the 21st-century. In 2024, &quot;Picture a day like this&quot; received an Ivor Novello Award nomination for Best Stage Work Composition.

An honorary fellow of King&#x27;s College Cambridge, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, Benjamin is also an Honorary Member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. He is foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. He was awarded a C.B.E. in 2010, made a Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2015, and was knighted in the 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
Benjamin lives in northwest London with his partner, the filmmaker Michael Waldman, whose credits include &quot;The Day John Lennon Died&quot;, &quot;The Scandalous Adventures of Lord Byron&quot;, and the TV miniseries &quot;Musicality&quot;.

<text>Martín Vargas Fuentes (born 24 January 1955) is a Chilean former professional boxer who challenged for a world title four times. As an amateur, he represented his native country at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany.

==Professional career==
On March 23, 1973, Vargas made his professional debut, beating Martín Muñoz by a decision in six rounds. He won twelve fights in a row before drawing (tying) with Nelson Muñoz on December 13, 1973. In 1974, he tasted defeat for the first time when he was knocked out in seven rounds by Alfredo Alcayaga. On October 11 of that same year, he and Alcayaga had a rematch, this time with the Chilean national flyweight title at stake. Vargas avenged his first defeat with a seven-round knockout win. One month later, he had his first fight abroad, a ten-round draw with Carlos Escalante]in Buenos Aires.

After fourteen wins in a row, Vargas had a chance to add the South American regional belt to his resume, and he did so by knocking out Gonzalo Cruz in round one on December 20, 1975 in Santiago. He defended that title twice, and after beating Carlos Escalante in their Uruguay rematch, Vargas&#x27; win streak reached 27 wins in a row.

On September 17, 1977, he fought for the world title for the first time; World Boxing Council world flyweight champion Miguel Canto defeated Vargas by a fifteen-round decision in Yucatán, Mexico. Vargas had one more win: two months after their first fight, Vargas once again challenged Canto, this time in Santiago. Canto broke the hearts of most Vargas fans on November 30, 1977 by defeating the hometown favorite, again by a fifteen-round decision.

On April 22 of 1978, Vargas beat future world champion Alfonso López by a knockout in round one to defend his South American title with success. On November 4 of that year, he challenged World Boxing Association (WBA) world champion Betulio González in the champion&#x27;s hometown of Maracay, Venezuela, but González retained the crown with a twelfth-round knockout victory. This defeat was followed by thirteen wins in a row, including points wins over future world champions Joey Olivo and Rafael Pedroza (cousin of Eusebio Pedroza). Vargas then traveled to Japan, where on June 1 he lost by a knockout in round eight what turned out to be his last world title bid to WBA world Junior flyweight champion Yoko Gushiken.

After the Gushiken fight, Vargas had a rather ordinary record of 21 wins and 7 losses before retiring for the first time in 1987. He did, however, add another regional title to his trophy case when he beat Delis Rojas on July 23, 1982 by a decision in twelve rounds in Miami, to earn the WBC Continental Americas flyweight title.

Having retired, Vargas&#x27; legend continued to grow among Chileans, many of whom spoke of the many times Vargas seemed to be close to become Chile&#x27;s first world boxing champion. He is still seen by many as the best boxer ever to come out of that country, and as a national hero of Chile.

In 1997, ten years after his original retirement, Vargas attempted a comeback. His first fight back was videotaped by a crew making a documentary film about him, and he defeated Gerónimo Rojas by a knockout in round two on July 4. On February 7, 1998, he added the Chilean Super Flyweight title to his collection of regional titles with a first-round knockout over José Carmona. One month later, he beat Juan Lielmil, also by knockout in round one, to regain the Chilean flyweight title. But after losing to Joel García, by knockout in round one on July 31 of that same year, he decided to retire permanently.

Vargas had a record of 91 wins, 15 losses and 3 draws, his 62 knockout wins making him a member of the exclusive group of fighters who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. In addition to the documentary about his comeback, a biographical movie about him was also produced in Chile.

==1972 Olympic results==
Below are the results of Martín Vargas, a Chilean flyweight boxer who competed at the 1972 Munich Olympics:

* Round of 64: bye
* Round of 32: lost to Calixto Perez (Colombia) on points, 0-5.

<text>Stuart Oliver Knussen (12 June 1952 – 8 July 2018) was a British composer of contemporary classical music and conductor. Among the most influential British composers of his generation, his relatively few compositions are &quot;rooted in 20th-century modernism, [but] beholden to no school but his own&quot; 

==Early life==
Oliver Knussen was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His father, Stuart Knussen, was principal double bass of the London Symphony Orchestra, and also participated in a number of premieres of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s music. Oliver Knussen studied composition with John Lambert between 1963 and 1969, and also received encouragement from Britten. He spent several summers studying with Gunther Schuller at Tanglewood in Massachusetts and in Boston.

==Musical life==
Knussen began composing at about the age of six; an ITV programme about his father&#x27;s work with the London Symphony Orchestra prompted the commissioning for his first symphony (1966–1967). Aged 15, Knussen stepped in to conduct his symphony&#x27;s première at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 7 April 1968, after István Kertész fell ill. After his debut, Daniel Barenboim asked him to conduct the work&#x27;s first two movements in New York a week later. In this work and his Concerto for Orchestra (1968–1970), he had quickly and fluently absorbed the influences of modernist composers Britten and Berg as well as many mid-century (largely American) symphonists, while displaying an unusual flair for pacing and orchestration.

It was as early as the Second Symphony (1970–1971), that in the words of Julian Anderson, that &quot;Knussen&#x27;s compositional personality abruptly appeared, fully formed&quot;.

His major works from the 1980s were his two children&#x27;s operas, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; and &quot;Higglety Pigglety Pop!&quot;, both libretti by Maurice Sendak – and based on Sendak&#x27;s own eponymous children&#x27;s books. &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; received its New York premiere in November 1986 by New York City Opera, which also performed the work in April 2011.

Knussen was the head of contemporary music activities at Tanglewood between 1986 and 1993.

A much-admired orchestral work from 1994 is his Horn Concerto written for Barry Tuckwell, which &quot;combines the colorful sound world of early 20th century music with a contemporary approach to time and melody&quot;.

He was awarded CBE in the 1994 Birthday Honours.

Knussen was principal guest conductor of The Hague&#x27;s Het Residentie Orkest (Residentie Orchestra) between 1992 and 1996, the Aldeburgh Festival&#x27;s co-artistic director between 1983 and 1998 and the London Sinfonietta&#x27;s music director between 1998 and 2002 – and became that ensemble&#x27;s conductor laureate.

In 2005, Knussen was the music director of the Ojai Music Festival.

Knussen wrote his &quot;Songs for Sue&quot;, a setting of four poems for soprano and 15-piece ensemble, as a memorial tribute to his late wife, and the music received its world première in Chicago in 2006. Knussen told Tom Service in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:I knew there were a number of Dickinson poems addressed to her sister, Sue, so one week I read all 1,700 poems of Emily Dickinson ... and I copied out about 35 of them by hand, I have no idea where the notes for this piece come from ... It seemed to want to be written ... I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it ... ought to be let out at all ... because I didn&#x27;t want it to be a self-indulgent thing. But actually it&#x27;s very restrained. It&#x27;s not a huge work – about 13 minutes – but it&#x27;s a big piece emotionally.

From September 2006, Knussen was artist-in-association to the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, and from 2009 to the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

As of autumn 2012, Knussen was writing a symphonic adagio for the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was also planning to finish two concertos that he had worked on for several years: one for piano and one for cello.

His recordings as a conductor include works by Modest Mussorgsky, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Elliott Carter, Igor Stravinsky, Hans Werner Henze, Toru Takemitsu, Colin Matthews, Alexander Goehr, Robin Holloway and Poul Ruders.

==Personal life==
Knussen was married to Sue Knussen, a US-born producer and director of music programmes for BBC television and for the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 – for which she made &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, an introduction to 20th-century music presented by Simon Rattle in a series of seven one-hour programmes, which won the 1996 BAFTA award for &quot;Best Arts Series&quot;. She ran the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s education department in the late 1990s. Oliver and Sue Knussen had a daughter, Sonya Knussen, who is a mezzo-soprano. Sue Knussen died of a blood infection in London in 2003. The Sue Knussen Composers Fund (previously, the Sue Knussen Commissioning Fund) &quot;honours her memory and professional legacy...and...commissions works from emerging composers to be performed by contemporary music ensembles worldwide.&quot;

Knussen lived in Snape, Suffolk, Benjamin Britten&#x27;s base during one of his most creative periods. Snape Maltings concert hall is the home of the Aldeburgh Festival.

Knussen died on 8 July 2018, aged 66.

<doc id="337969" wikidata="Q5020827" url="?curid=337969" title="2002 California Proposition 52">
<text>Proposition 52 was a California ballot proposition on the November 5, 2002 ballot. It failed to pass with 2,808,240 (40.6%) votes in favor and 4,108,362 (59.4%) against. It would allow Election Day voter registration, removing the deadline to register to vote, which was 15 days prior to an election. It was placed on the ballot through the initiative process.

The question before voters was:
:&quot;Should legally eligible California residents presenting proof of current residence be allowed to register to vote on Election Day?&quot;

== Official summary ==
*Allows persons who are legally eligible to vote and have valid identification to register to vote on election day at their polling place.
*Increases criminal penalty for voter and voter registration fraud.
*Criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter fraud.
*Requires trained staff at polling places to manage election day registration, creates fund to implement measure, including training and providing personnel for election day registration.
*Allows persons to register or reregister during 28 days preceding election day at local election offices.
*Provides more time to county election officials to prepare voter registration lists.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:

*Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities, thereby resulting in no anticipated net county cost.
*Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce a new election fraud offense.

<doc id="337976" wikidata="Q131152" url="?curid=337976" title="Shirin Ebadi">
<text>Shirin Ebadi (; born 21 June 1947) is an Iranian Nobel laureate, lawyer, writer, teacher and a former judge and founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. In 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her pioneering efforts for democracy and women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s, and refugee rights. She was the first Muslim woman and the first Iranian to receive the award.

She has lived in exile in London since 2009.

== Life and early career as a judge ==
Ebadi was born in Hamadan into an educated Persian family. Her father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, was the city&#x27;s chief notary public and a professor of commercial law. Her mother, Minu Yamini, was a homemaker. She was of Jewish descent. When she was an infant, her family moved to Tehran. Before earning a law degree from the University of Tehran Ebadi attended Anoshiravn Dadgar and Reza Shah Kabir schools. 

She was admitted to the law department of the University of Tehran in 1965 and 1969; upon graduation, she passed the qualification exams to become a judge. After a six-month internship period, she officially became a judge in March 1969. She continued her studies at the University of Tehran to pursue a doctorate in law; in 1971, one of her professors was Mahmoud Shehabi Khorassani. In 1975, she became the first female president of the Tehran city court and served until the Iranian Revolution. She was one of the first female judges in Iran.

After the 1979 Revolution women were no longer allowed to serve as judges and
she was dismissed and given a new job as a clerk in the court she had presided over.

Later, despite already having a law office permit her applications were repeatedly rejected, and Ebadi was unable to practice law until 1993. She used this free time to write books and many articles in Iranian periodicals.

== Ebadi as a lawyer ==

By 2004, Ebadi was lecturing law at the University of Tehran while practicing law in Iran. She is a campaigner for strengthening the legal status of children and women, and her work on women&#x27;s rights played a key role in the May 1997 landslide presidential election of the reformist Mohammad Khatami.

As a lawyer, she is known for taking up &quot;pro bono&quot; cases of dissident figures who have fallen foul of the judiciary. Among her clients were the family of Dariush Forouhar, a dissident intellectual and politician who was found stabbed to death – along with his wife, Parvaneh Eskandari – in their home.

The couple was among several dissidents who died in a spate of gruesome murders that terrorized Iran&#x27;s intellectual community. Suspicion fell on extremist hard-liners determined to stop the more liberal climate fostered by President Khatami, who championed freedom of speech. The murders were found to be committed by a team of employees of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, whose head, Saeed Emami, allegedly committed suicide in jail before being brought to court.

Ebadi also represented the family of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad, who was killed in the Iranian student protests in July 1999. In 2000 Ebadi was accused of manipulating the videotaped confession of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi, a former member of the Ansar-e Hezbollah. Ebrahimi confessed his involvement in attacks by the organization on the orders of high-level conservative authorities, including the killing of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad and attacks against members of President Khatami&#x27;s cabinet. Ebadi claimed that she had only videotaped Amir Farshad Ebrahimi&#x27;s confessions to present them to the court. This case was named &quot;Tape makers&quot; by hardliners who questioned the credibility of his videotaped deposition and his motives. Ebadi and another lawyer, Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi&#x27;s videotaped deposition to President Khatami and the head of the Islamic judiciary. The Islamic judiciary&#x27;s supreme court later vacated the sentences, but they did not forgive Ebarahimi&#x27;s videotaped confession and sentenced him to 48 months in jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement. This case brought an increased focus on Iran from human rights groups abroad.

Ebadi has also defended various child abuse cases, including the case of Arian Golshani, a child who was abused for years and then beaten to death by her father and stepbrother. This case gained international attention and caused controversy in Iran. Ebadi used this case to highlight Iran&#x27;s problematic child custody laws, whereby custody of children in divorce is usually given to the father, even in the case of Arian, where her mother had told the court that the father was abusive and had begged for custody of her daughter. Ebadi also handled the case of Leila, a teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered. Leila&#x27;s family became homeless, trying to cover the costs of the execution of the perpetrators owed to the government because, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is the victim&#x27;s family&#x27;s responsibility to pay to restore their honor when a girl is raped by paying the government to execute the perpetrator. Ebadi was not able to achieve victory in this case. Still, she brought international attention to this problematic law. Ebadi also handled a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of Habibollah Peyman, Abbas Marufi, and Faraj Sarkouhi). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with Western funding, the &quot;Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child&quot; (SPRC) (1994) and the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC) in 2001.

She also helped in the drafting of the original text of a law against physical abuse of children, which was passed by the Iranian parliament in 2002. Female members of Parliament also asked Ebadi to draft a law explaining how a woman&#x27;s right to divorce her husband is in line with Sharia (Islamic Law). Ebadi presented the bill before the government, but the male members made her leave without considering the bill, according to Ebadi&#x27;s memoir.

== Political views ==
In her book &quot;Iran Awakening&quot;, Ebadi explains her political/religious views on Islam, democracy and gender equality:
In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. Not religion binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief and the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within has underpinned my work.

At the same time, Ebadi expresses a nationalist love of Iran and has criticized the policies and actions of Western countries. She opposed the pro-Western Shah, initially supported the Islamic Revolution, and remembers the CIA&#x27;s 1953 overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq with rage.

At a press conference shortly after the Peace Prize announcement, Ebadi explicitly rejected foreign interference in the country&#x27;s affairs: &quot;The fight for human rights is conducted in Iran by the Iranian people, and we are against any foreign intervention in Iran.&quot;

Subsequently, Ebadi openly defended the Islamic regime&#x27;s nuclear development program:
Aside from being economically justified, it has become a cause of national pride for an old nation with a glorious history. No Iranian government, regardless of its ideology or democratic credentials, would dare to stop the program.

However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi stated:

The [Iranian] people want to stop enrichment, but the government doesn&#x27;t listen. Iran is situated on a fault line, and people are scared of a Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am not a member of the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The fear is that if they do, Israel will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [In 2009] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying.

Concerning the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in 2010, Shirin Ebadi, was one of four Peace Prize laureates supporting legislation requiring the University of California to divest itself from any companies providing technology to the Israel Defense Forces, who (bill supporters declared) were engaged in war crimes. (The legislation was supported by the Associated Students of the University of California).
Since the victory of Hassan Rouhani in the 2013 Iranian presidential election, Shirin Ebadi has expressed her worry about the growing human rights violations in her homeland. Ebadi, in her Dec. 2013 speech at Human Rights Day seminar at Leiden University angrily said: &quot;I will shut up, but the problems of Iran will not be solved&quot;.

In April 2015, speaking on the subject of the Western campaign against the Sunni extremist group ISIL in Syria and Iraq, Ebadi expressed her desire that the Western world spend money funding education and an end to corruption rather than fighting with guns and bombs. She reasoned that because the Islamic State stems from an ideology based on a &quot;wrong interpretation of Islam&quot;, the physical force will not end ISIS because it will not end its beliefs.

In 2018, in an interview with Bloomberg, Ebadi stated her belief that the Islamic Republic has reached a point of which it is now un-reformable. Ebadi called for a referendum on the Islamic Republic.

== Nobel Peace Prize ==
On 10 October 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. The selection committee praised her as a &quot;courageous person&quot; who &quot;has never heeded the threat to her own safety&quot;. Now she travels abroad lecturing in the West. She is against a policy of forced regime change.

The decision of the Nobel committee surprised some observers worldwide. Pope John Paul II had been predicted to win the Peace Prize amid speculation that he was nearing death. The era in which her prize was granted has been called one &quot;when there still seemed a chance of something resembling a détente&quot; between the U.S. and Iran (according to Associate Press).

She presented a book entitled &quot;Democracy, human rights, and Islam in modern Iran: Psychological, social and cultural perspectives&quot; to the Nobel Committee. The volume documents the historical and cultural basis of democracy and human rights from Cyrus and Darius, 2,500 years ago to Mohammad Mossadeq, the prime minister of modern Iran who nationalized the oil industry.

In her acceptance speech, Ebadi criticized repression in Iran and insisted that Islam was compatible with democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion. In the same speech she also criticized US foreign policy, particularly the War on terrorism. She was the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize.

Thousands greeted her at the airport when she returned from Paris after receiving the news that she had won the prize. The response to the Award in Iran was mixed—enthusiastic supporters greeted her at the airport upon her return, the conservative media underplayed it, and then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami criticized it as political. In Iran, officials of the Islamic Republic were either silent or critical of the selection of Ebadi, calling it a political act by a pro-Western institution and were also critical when Ebadi did not cover her hair at the Nobel award ceremony. IRNA reported the Nobel committee&#x27;s decision in few lines that the evening newspapers and the Iranian state media waited hours to report —and then only as the last item on the radio news update. Reformist officials are said to have &quot;generally welcomed the award&quot;, but &quot;come under attack for doing so.&quot; Reformist president Mohammad Khatami did not officially congratulate Ms. Ebadi and stated that although the scientific Nobels are important, the Peace Prize is &quot;not very important&quot; and was awarded to Ebadi on the basis of &quot;totally political criteria&quot;. Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the only official to initially congratulate Ebadi, defended the president saying &quot;abusing the President&#x27;s words about Ms. Ebadi is tantamount to abusing the prize bestowed on her for political considerations&quot;.

In 2009, Norway&#x27;s Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, published a statement reporting that Ebadi&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize had been confiscated by Iranian authorities and that &quot;This [was] the first time a Nobel Peace Prize ha[d] been confiscated by national authorities.&quot; Iran denied the charges.

== Post-Nobel prize ==

Since receiving the Nobel Prize, Ebadi has lectured, taught and received awards in different countries, issued statements and defended people accused of political crimes in Iran. She has traveled to and spoken to audiences in India, the United States, and other countries; released her autobiography in an English translation. With five other Nobel laureates, she created the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative to promote peace, justice, and equality for women. In 2019, Ebadi called for a treaty to end violence against women, in support of Every Woman Coalition.

=== Threats ===
In April 2008, she told Reuters news agency that Iran&#x27;s human rights record had regressed in the past two years and agreed to defend Baháʼís arrested in Iran in May 2008.

In April 2008, Ebadi released a statement saying: &quot;Threats against my life and security and those of my family, which began some time ago, have intensified&quot;, and that the threats warned her against making speeches abroad and to stop defending Iran&#x27;s persecuted Baháʼí community. In August 2008, the IRNA news agency published an article attacking Ebadi&#x27;s links to the Baháʼí Faith and accused her of seeking support from the West. It also criticized Ebadi for defending homosexuals, appearing without the Islamic headscarf abroad, questioning Islamic punishments, and &quot;defending CIA agents&quot;. It accused her daughter, Nargess Tavassolian, of conversion to the Baháʼí faith, a capital offense in the Islamic Republic. However Shirin Ebadi has denied it, saying, &quot;I am proud to say that my family and I are Shiites,&quot; Her daughter believes &quot;the government wanted to scare my mother with this scenario.&quot; Ebadi believes the attacks are in retaliation for her agreeing to defend the families of the seven Baháʼís arrested in May.

In December 2008, Iranian police shut down the office of a human rights group led by her. Another human rights group, Human Rights Watch, has said it was &quot;extremely worried&quot; about Ebadi&#x27;s safety., and in December 2009 issued a statement demanding the Islamic Republic &quot;stop harassing&quot; her. Among many other complaints, the group accused the IRI of detaining &quot;Ebadi&#x27;s husband and sister for questioning and threatened them with losing their jobs and eventual arrest if Ebadi continues her human rights advocacy.&quot;

=== Seizure ===
Ebadi said while in London in late November 2009 that her Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma had been taken from their bank box alongside her and a ring she had received from Germany&#x27;s association of journalists. She said they had been taken by the Revolutionary Court approximately three weeks previously. Ebadi also said her bank account was frozen by authorities. Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre expressed his &quot;shock and disbelief&quot; at the incident. The Iranian foreign ministry subsequently denied the confiscation, and also criticized Norway for interfering in Iran&#x27;s affairs.

Undemocratic countries are more dangerous than a nuclear bomb.

I have been arrested solely because of my activities in human rights,&quot; Ebadi said.
* 2010 (June) – Ebadi&#x27;s husband denounced her on state television. According to Ebadi this was a coerced confession after his arrest and torture.

== Lawsuits ==
=== Lawsuit against the United States ===
In 2004, Ebadi filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Treasury because of restrictions she faced over publishing her memoir in the United States. American trade laws prohibit writers from embargoed countries. The law also banned American literary agent Wendy Strothman from working with Ebadi. Azar Nafisi wrote a letter in support of Ebadi. Nafisi said that the law infringes on the First Amendment. After a lengthy legal battle, Ebadi won and was able to publish her memoir in the United States.

<doc id="337977" wikidata="Q4671191" url="?curid=337977" title="Academic dress of the University of Oxford">
<text>The University of Oxford has a long tradition of academic dress, which continues to the present day.

== Occasions for use ==
Unlike most other universities, which only usually require it during specific university ceremonies such as graduation, academic dress is worn very often in Oxford (although no longer as an element of everyday dress). Every undergraduate and graduate must obtain a gown, cap, and white bow tie or black tie or black ribbon for the purpose of the university matriculation ceremony, where students formally become members of the university.

Regulations regarding gowns differ from college to college, but gowns are commonly worn to:

* Formal Hall (formal dinner, which occurs as frequently as every night in some colleges and as rarely as once a term in others, or not at all)
* Major public lectures
* Chapel
* College collections (internal examinations at the start of term)
* Head of house&#x27;s collections (end of term academic progress reports)
* College matriculation

Gowns and caps are worn to disciplinary hearings in the Proctors&#x27; Court.

In addition, gowns are worn with cap, hood (for graduates), and &quot;subfusc&quot; to:

* University examinations
* University matriculation
* Graduation ceremonies
* The annual Encaenia (Commemoration) ceremony.

On certain occasions, e.g. the Encaenia garden party, by tradition, graduates wear gown and hood without &quot;subfusc&quot;.
The wearing of &quot;subfusc&quot; remains a popular tradition. In May 2015 students voted overwhelmingly in favour of compulsory academic dress in examinations, with 75.8% supporting &quot;subfusc&quot; and 78% supporting gowns, in a referendum with an unusually high 40.6% turnout. A previous referendum in 2006 showed 81% support for subfusc. Both referendums were widely interpreted by students as a vote not so much as on making &quot;subfusc&quot; voluntary, but rather on whether or not to effectively abolish it by default, as it was assumed that if a minority of people came to exams without &quot;subfusc&quot;, the rest would soon follow.

==Components==
After the names of the components, the Groves classification system is given.

===Gowns===
The gowns in use in Oxford can be divided into two basic shapes. All gowns are open-fronted, except for the Doctors&#x27; convocation habit which is closed at the front.

====&quot;Clerical-type&quot; gowns====
* Scholars&#x27; gown [u2]
* BA gown [b1]
* MA gown [m1]
* BD gown [m1]
* DD undress gown [m1]
* Doctors&#x27; full dress gown [d2]
* Doctors&#x27; convocation habit [d5]
* Proctors&#x27; dress gown [d2]

The &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown has no collar, but instead has the voluminous material of its back and sleeves gathered into a yoke. Most of the above have open sleeves; those of the BA have long points at the back of the sleeve reaching down to the hem of the gown, while doctors&#x27;, assessors&#x27; and proctors&#x27; gowns have bell-shaped sleeves about wrist-length. Scholar&#x27;s gowns reach only the wearer&#x27;s knees, and their open sleeves are either bell-shaped or pointed, reaching just beyond the elbow. The exceptions are the MA gown and the Doctors&#x27; convocation habit; the MA gown has long closed sleeves with arm slits just above the elbow and a crescent-shaped cut at the foot of the sleeve, forming two forward-facing points, while the Doctors&#x27; convocation habit is sleeveless.

Gowns of the same basic shape are worn by barristers (see court dress), preachers and bishops in the Church of England.

====&quot;Lay-type&quot; gowns====
* Commoners&#x27; gown [u5]
* Graduate students&#x27; gown [u5]
* Higher faculties bachelors&#x27; and masters&#x27; laced gown [d4]
* Doctors&#x27; undress laced gown [d4]
* Chancellor&#x27;s/Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s gold laced gown [d4]
* Bedels&#x27;, University Verger&#x27;s, etc. gown [d4]

The &quot;lay-type&quot; gown derives from a garment fashionable in Elizabethan times. It is less voluminous than the &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown, and has a flap collar and long closed sleeves with arm slits just above the elbow, except for the Commoners&#x27; and Graduate students&#x27; gowns, whose closed sleeves have evolved into streamers through which the arm does not pass. Commoners&#x27; gowns reach to the wearer&#x27;s waist, and Graduates&#x27; to around their knees. Doctors&#x27; undress gowns are the same as those of higher faculties Bachelors and Masters gowns, with the addition of even more decorative lace on the underside of the sleeves. 

Gowns of the same basic shape are worn by solicitors, Queen&#x27;s Counsel, court ushers, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Lord Chancellor.

===Hoods===

Hoods in Oxford are of three shapes. Doctors (except Doctors of Clinical Psychology and Doctors of Engineering) and Bachelors of Divinity wear hoods in the &quot;Oxford full shape&quot; [f5], scarlet in the case of doctors and black in the case of Bachelors of Divinity. All other hoods can be either in the &quot;Burgon shape&quot; [s2] or the &quot;Oxford simple shape&quot; [s1], though some are traditionally made in one shape or the other. Most of the newer degrees use the Burgon whilst older degrees use either, although the Burgon shape is becoming more popular.

Generally, hoods are worn by graduates whenever &quot;subfusc&quot; is worn, but sometimes they are worn with an ordinary tie, e.g. by the lecturer at a public lecture.

===Academic caps===
Men wear a mortarboard (also known as a &quot;square&quot; or trencher cap) [h1], which is not worn indoors, except by the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Proctors. When meeting the Vice-Chancellor, Proctors, or other senior official of the university in the street, it is traditional for a man to touch or raise his cap.

Women may choose between the mortarboard or the &quot;soft cap&quot; [h5]. Originally, women were required to wear their soft caps during university ceremonies. From Michaelmas 1995, they were required to wear the soft cap, but permitted either to wear or to carry the mortarboard. From Hilary 2008, they are now, like men, required to carry their mortarboards when at university ceremonies indoors. Women who opt for the soft cap must still wear, and not carry, them indoors.

Doctors in the lay faculties (i.e. those except Divinity and Philosophy) wear Tudor bonnets [h2], which are round and made of velvet.

=== &quot;Subfusc&quot;===
&quot;Subfusc&quot; () comes from the Latin for &#x27;of a dark/dusky colour&#x27;, and refers to the clothes worn with full academic dress in Oxford. Their origins stem from the formal day dress worn in the past that has, to a certain extent, fossilised around the Edwardian period into what it is now and has changed only slightly since to accommodate modern trends and needs.

As of October 2012, the University of Oxford regulations on &quot;subfusc&quot; have no reference to sex, meaning students of either sex can wear what is historically prescribed as male or female clothing, or, under the letter of the regulations, even a combination (although this is informally discouraged).

Previously, men were required to wear:

*Dark suit and socks.
*Black shoes.
*White shirt and collar.
*White bow tie.

Women were previously required to wear:

*White blouse.
*Black tie (either a bow tie or velvet ribbon).
*Black skirt or trousers.
*Black stockings or tights.
*Black shoes.
*Dark coat (if desired).

In addition, doctors in the higher faculties and senior university officials wear bands, such as those worn with legal court dress.

Members of the British Armed Forces may wear their service uniform with gown and hood (for graduates) in place of &quot;subfusc&quot; and cap. There is no formal guidance about what order of dress should be worn (i.e. Army No. 1 or Service Dress) or whether swords are worn; however, uniform caps are worn in the street and carried when indoors. Persons in Holy Orders may wear clerical dress instead of &quot;subfusc&quot;.

&quot;Subfusc&quot; is worn at university matriculation, at university examinations and degree ceremonies and at Encaenia. It is traditional, although not compulsory, that during exams, candidates also wear a carnation: white for the first exam, pink thereafter, and red for the final exam of the run. The one exception to this is found in the law students of Magdalen College, who wear green carnations for all of their Law Moderations. Although this system has differed over time, this is the one currently advised by the university and its Colleges. The carnations are often, although not necessarily, gifted to candidates by friends or members of their college &quot;families&quot;.

A number of myths surround &quot;subfusc&quot; and its use in examinations - for example, that &quot;subfusc&quot; has a counterpart in &#x27;full fusc&#x27;, said to be a full suit of armour, which if worn to Finals examinations automatically results in a student being given a First; or the claim that one enterprising undergraduate examined the university statutes prior to an examination and discovered that all students sitting exams in &quot;full fusc&quot; are entitled to a glass of sherry. He demanded his due in the exam, and the university&#x27;s proctors duly responded, before fining him one shilling for failing to wear his sword, allegedly also part of the archaic statutes. This latter story is disputed as untrue, and has been circulating in various forms (sometimes attributed to Cambridge) since at least the late 1950s.

===Materials===
Although gowns and robes have traditionally been made from stuff, Russell cord or (in the case of members of the higher faculties) silk, most modern gowns and robes are made from synthetic material such as polyester. Similarly, hoods and gowns traditionally made out of silk are now more usually made of synthetic &quot;art silk&quot;. Rabbit fur is also rarely now used in the making of bachelors&#x27; hoods, with artificial fur used instead.

== Student dress ==
===Undergraduates===
&quot;Commoners&quot; (i.e. those without a scholarship or exhibition) wear a short black &quot;lay-type&quot; gown which just covers the suit jacket. The gowns have a flap collar and instead of sleeves have two streamers adorned with folds. These are the remnants of closed sleeves, as can still be seen on the laced gowns of the higher faculties.

&quot;Scholars&quot; (and some &quot;exhibitioners&quot;) wear a black &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown down to the knee. The gowns are gathered at the yoke, and have bell sleeves to the elbows (in effect they are shorter versions of the BA gown). For undergraduates, scholars are likely to be students who received a distinction in their first-year examinations, or who have received a scholarship for academic excellence in a specific topic. As a very general approximation, students wearing scholars&#x27; gowns may be predicted to achieve a first-class degree on completion of their final examinations.

Until the abolition of their statuses in the nineteenth century, &quot;gentlemen-commoners&quot; and &quot;noblemen-commoners&quot; each had distinct gowns, generally of coloured silk in the &quot;lay&quot; shape, decorated with lace.

====Undergraduates and mortarboards====
It is often claimed that undergraduates by custom do not wear their caps (or even that they can be fined for doing so). This is incorrect. Outdoors, caps may be worn, but it is customary to touch or raise one&#x27;s cap as a salute to senior university or college officers. Like all other male members of the university (including graduates) other than the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Proctors, male undergraduates must remove their caps during university ceremonies indoors.

It is also only in recent years that female undergraduates have been permitted to remove their mortarboards during university ceremonies. Women who opt for the mortarboard now no longer wear them indoors, but conform with the practice of male members of the university. As mentioned earlier, women who opt for the traditional women&#x27;s soft cap still do not have this dispensation, and should remain covered at all times.

There are instances when male undergraduates are required to wear their mortarboards indoors. Undergraduates appearing before the Proctors&#x27; Court are required to present themselves wearing their caps and to salute the Proctors in the customary manner upon entering. They then remove their caps for the remainder of the proceedings.

===Postgraduates===
Graduate students who do not already have an Oxford degree wear a black &quot;lay-type&quot; gown that is a full-sized version of the commoner&#x27;s gown, reaching to the knee. However, they are not worn by graduates of other universities who are reading for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, who wear a commoner&#x27;s or scholar&#x27;s gown as appropriate. Nor are they worn by non-members of the university reading for diplomas, who wear no gown, even with &quot;sub-fusc&quot;. Alternatively, graduate students may wear the academic dress of their old university except at those occasions where &quot;foreign&quot; academic dress is prohibited, such as the &quot;Encaenia&quot; and the second half of degree ceremonies when the graduand pays his respects to the Vice-Chancellor in the dress of his new Oxford degree.

== Graduate dress ==

=== BA and MA ===
The two most common graduate gowns in Oxford are the Bachelor of Arts (BA) [b1] and Master of Arts (MA) [m1] gowns, which are worn by new graduates of whatever subject. The degree of Master of Arts is granted to BA graduates at a degree ceremony no sooner than 21 terms after matriculation.

The BA gown is a long black &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown with long bell-shaped sleeves to the wrists. The gown is gathered at the yoke. The MA gown is similar to the BA gown, except that the long sleeves are squared and closed at the ends, with a crescent cut out of each sleeve-end, and a horizontal slit just above the elbow for the arm to pass through.

The hoods are as follows:

* MA – black silk edged and lined with crimson / shot crimson silk
* BA – black silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur

Those with undergraduate master&#x27;s degrees awarded for certain 4-year courses in the sciences (M.Biochem., M.Chem., M.CompSci., M.EarthSci., M.Eng., M.Math., M.MathCompSci., M.MathPhil., M.Phys., M.PhysPhil.) previously wore BA gowns and hoods, transitioning to the MA gown and hood 21 terms after matriculation, but since 2014 they have worn the laced master&#x27;s gown with a hood lined in sand fabric.

=== Doctors ===
Doctors in Oxford have three forms of academic dress: undress, full dress and convocation dress.

The &quot;undress gown&quot; in the lay faculties is a black &quot;lay-type&quot; gown with a flap collar and closed sleeves, decorated with black silk lace; for Doctors of Divinity, it is the MA gown in black silk. These may be worn with a doctor&#x27;s hood, which varies between different doctors&#x27; degrees:

*DD – scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with black silk
*DCL, DM – scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with crimson silk
*DLitt, DSc – scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with grey silk
*DPhil – scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with dark blue silk
The &quot;full dress gown&quot; is a scarlet &quot;clerical-type&quot; yoke-gathered gown, with open bell-shaped sleeves. The sleeves and facings are in the appropriate coloured silk. Full dress gowns are normally worn over &quot;sub-fusc&quot;, but never with a hood.

The &quot;convocation habit&quot; or chimere is like a scarlet full-dress gown, except in that it has no sleeves, is part-lined with silk of the appropriate colour, and closed at the front. It is worn over the undress gown, thus the sleeves of the latter protrude. It is always worn with white tie, bands and hood. A similar garment (in scarlet or black) is worn over a white rochet by Church of England bishops especially when sitting in the House of Lords.

Doctors of Music have no convocation habit, as this degree (as well as that of Bachelor of Music) was open to those who were not members of Convocation. The degree is known to have existed since the early 16th century, and seems to have originally used the same robes as Doctors of Medicine, on the rare occasions when this was necessary. However, since the beginning of the 17th century, Doctors of Music have worn gowns of white or cream damask or brocade, with facings and sleeve-linings (see below) present since at least the late 18th century: the latter are shown in a 1792 plate by Charles Grignion the Elder. Today, their full dress gown is made of cream silk brocade with apple blossom embroidery, with cherry red silk sleeves and facings. The hood worn with the undress gown is of the same materials:

* DMus – cream apple blossom silk brocade (full shape) lined with cherry silk.

=== Bachelors of Divinity ===
Bachelors of Divinity, unlike their counterparts in the other higher faculties, do not wear the black silk laced gown but wear a black undress gown of the &quot;clerical type&quot;, identical to the MA gown, but in silk rather than stuff. This is worn with a cassock, cincture and scarf. The hoods are as follows:

* BD – black corded silk (full shape) lined with black ribbed silk

=== Bachelors and Masters in the lay higher faculties ===
Members with postgraduate bachelors or master&#x27;s degrees in the lay higher faculties (i.e. those other than Divinity or Arts) wear gowns almost identical to the lay doctors&#x27; undress gowns (with the exception of the MCh, the gowns of bachelors&#x27; and masters&#x27; do not have an extra panel of gimp underneath the arms).

The hoods of bachelors and masters of the lay higher faculties are as follows:

* MCh – black silk edged and lined with dark blue silk
* BCL, MJur, BM BCh – steel blue silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur
* MLitt, MSc – light blue silk edged and lined with grey silk
* BLitt, BSc (no longer awarded) – light blue silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur

The BMus hood was originally of the same colour as the hoods for the other lay higher degrees (BCL, BM).

=== Other doctors&#x27;, masters&#x27; and bachelors&#x27; degrees ===
The newer master&#x27;s degrees follow with the silk gown of the lay higher faculties, and the following hoods:

* MBA – claret silk edged and lined with dark grey silk
* MSt – deep green silk edged and lined with white silk
* MEd (no longer awarded) – black silk edged and lined with green silk
* MTh – black silk edged and lined with magenta silk
* MFA – gold silk edged and lined white silk 
* MPP – dark blue silk edged and lined with silver silk
* MEng, and other undergraduate masters (MBiochem, MChem, MCompSci, MEarthSci, MMath, MPhys and current and future equivalent joint-subject degrees) – black silk edged and lined with sand silk,

The newer bachelor&#x27;s degrees follow with the stuff gown of the BA, and the following hoods:

* BFA – black silk with a narrow band of gold silk
* BEd (no longer awarded) – black silk with a narrow band of green silk
* BTh – black silk with a narrow band of magenta silk.

The academical dress of the new professional doctorates are:

*DClinPsychol – blue Burgon simple-shape lined red silk
*EngD – red Burgon shape lined petrol blue edged grey 

There is no full dress gown for the professional doctorates so the doctor&#x27;s undress gown is worn.

== University officials ==

=== The chancellor ===
The chancellor of the university is elected for life by the Convocation (i.e. the alumni with degrees) of the university. He wears on ceremonial occasions a black silk &quot;lay-type&quot; gown with a long train, decorated with gold lace, similar to the gowns of the Lord Chancellor. The chancellor&#x27;s mortarboard has a gold tassel, like that of the former noblemen commoners. In undress he wears the DCL dress or undress gown. In Oxford he always wears white tie and bands though in the past he wore a &#x27;waterfall cravat&#x27; with court dress underneath his robes.

In 2015, a new robe was made for the chancellor in light of the original robes being over 100 years old and becoming fragile. This is similar to the new robe of the vice-chancellor save that the embroidery is on the facings rather than the sleeves. The rest of the robe has the gimp lace pentagons in the usual places.

=== The vice-chancellor ===
Previously vice-chancellors had no distinctive dress, but instead wore the black gown, convocation habit and hood if they were doctors or the MA gown and hood if they were not. When John Hood, a non-MA from outside the Congregation of the university, was appointed vice-chancellor in 2005, a new &quot;lay-type&quot; (undress) gown was designed for him, being black with simple gold trimming on the sleeves and flap collar.

An official/dress robe was commissioned in 2006. It is a lay-type gown with detachable panels on the lower sleeves of embroidered gold and silver laurel branches growing out of the university shield with the arms of the university&#x27;s colleges seated on them. The back of the gown has a large university shield similarly trimmed with gold and silver laurel branches.

=== Proctors ===
The two proctors in Oxford are responsible for the discipline of junior members of the university. In addition they have various ceremonial and administrative roles.

In Oxford the proctors wear white tie and bands, and a black &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown of the doctors&#x27; full dress pattern with sleeves and facings of dark blue velvet (formerly black velvet). A hood fully lined with miniver is worn turned inside out so that only the fur is visible. This was formerly the full dress of the M.A. On both their proctorial and undress M.A. gowns they have a tippet, or small pouch, sewn to bottom-left of the yoke; this is kept for life on the MA gown even after their year in office.

Each proctor may appoint up to two pro-proctors, who may act in their stead throughout their year of office. The pro-proctors, when on duty, similarly wear &quot;sub-fusc&quot;, white tie and bands, and their own gown, which is a black &quot;clerical-type&quot; gown of the MA shape, with facings of black velvet and a tippet sewn to the bottom-left of the yoke. When performing proctorial roles pro-proctors wear the proctors&#x27; hood.

In both Oxford and Cambridge the proctors could formerly be seen patrolling the streets after dark with the university police, or &quot;bulldogs&quot;, who wore top hats in Cambridge and bowler hats in Oxford.

=== The assessor ===
Previously the assessor wore an MA gown with a tippet sewn onto the yoke. He or she now wears a proctor&#x27;s dress gown with purple instead of blue velvet sleeves and facings. A button and tassel is sewn to the bottom-right of the yoke of their assessorial and undress M.A. gowns, which, as with the proctors&#x27; tippets, is kept for life on the MA gown. The assessor&#x27;s hood is Burgon or Oxford simple-shape made of unlined white corded silk.

=== Bedels and the verger ===
The university bedels (or mace-bearers) and the university verger wear plain black &quot;lay-type&quot; gowns and Tudor bonnets, and white tie and bands.

=== Members of the chancellor&#x27;s court of benefactors ===
Members of the court wear a gown in the shape of doctor&#x27;s gown that is deep cherry in colour. There is a line of lace that runs across the collar, down the facings in addition to two lines around the sleeves. They wear a bonnet of deep cherry with a short tassel in the same colour.

<text>King Weilie of Zhou (), personal name Ji Wu, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty.

His reign started in 425 BC, after his father King Kao had died, and lasted until his death in 402 BC.

During King Weilie&#x27;s reign, he created Han, Wei and Zhao as feudal states separate from Jin, to act as a buffer between his royal domain and Qin (nominally one of his subject states). 

King Weilie was succeeded by his son, King An.

<doc id="337980" wikidata="Q2113072" url="?curid=337980" title="Proporz">
<text>Proporz (, from , &quot;proportionality&quot;) is a long-standing practice in the Second Austrian Republic in which positions in government are distributed between political parties in a manner proportional to their electoral or public support. More broadly, it describes a culture of power sharing and consensus between Austria&#x27;s two major parties, the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) and the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), which developed throughout the period of grand coalition government from 1945 to 1966. During this time, partisan divisions were established in most government institutions and the public service, designed to balance the influence of both parties.

Much of the system has been dismantled over time, particularly since the 1990s. While in 1999 all but one of the nine federal states operated &quot;Proporz&quot; systems, five have since formally abolished them. Some aspects, such as its application on a municipal level, endure to this day.

==Origins==
After the re-establishment of Austrian independence in 1945, there was a great desire to avoid the ideological factionalism that characterised the First Austrian Republic (1919–1934). The divide between the socialists on the left and Catholic conservatives on the right ultimately led to the Austrian Civil War and ensuing Austrofascist dictatorship, which ended after Austria&#x27;s annexation by Nazi Germany.

This was exacerbated by the need for reconstruction in the wake of the Second World War, as well as Austria&#x27;s precarious position between the Western Allies and Soviet Union. These factors compelled the Austrian authorities to seek consensus and democratic stability in the new republic. All-party or &quot;concentration&quot; government was practised in both Allied-occupied Germany and Austria after the war – the provisional government of Karl Renner comprised a coalition of the ÖVP, SPÖ, and Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) – but the development of &quot;Proporz&quot; truly began after the first national election. The ÖVP under Leopold Figl won an absolute majority of seats, but nonetheless invited the SPÖ to join the cabinet.

==Development==
===Federal level===
The federal grand coalition was renewed after every election until 1966. During the ensuing 21 years, an elaborate system was set up throughout the political and public service, in which partisan officials were appointed in an attempt to give approximately equal influence to both the ÖVP and SPÖ. Within the federal cabinet, state secretaries of one party were typically appointed to ministries controlled by the other. In addition, certain cabinet portfolios were nearly always awarded to one party or the other by convention; examples include the Ministry of Labour for the SPÖ and the Ministry of Agriculture for the ÖVP. On its own, this is in line with common practice in many countries with coalition government, but the extent to which the parties sought to institutionalise these divisions became synonymous with &quot;Proporz&quot;.

In 1949, &quot;Proporz&quot; was expanded to include the senior management of nationalized industry. After the success of the right-wing Federation of Independents in the 1949 election, the government sought to limit its influence by applying &quot;Proporz&quot; at all levels of administration. This included the Austrian &quot;social partnership&quot;, in which workers, farmers, and employers are represented in government by four elected bodies. The SPÖ headed the Chamber of Labour and Austrian Trade Union Federation, while the ÖVP headed the Austrian Economic Chamber and Chamber of Agriculture.

From 1958 onwards, the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) was headed by four officials – two from each party – with the ÖVP having responsibility for radio and the SPÖ for television, which at this stage was in its infancy. After the importance of television became clear, the parties began to wrestle for influence. This was resolved by a secret agreement made during negotiations for the second Gorbach government, in which the parties agreed that every senior position in radio and television be shared between a director from one party and deputy director from the other. After the agreement was leaked to the &quot;Kurier&quot;, the newspaper began a petition for a referendum to remove political influence over the ORF. The requirement of 200,000 signatures was overwhelmingly exceeded, with 832,353 received between 5 and 12 October 1964. However, the bill for the referendum never made it beyond committee in the National Council because the governing parties, which headed the committees, feared losing influence. A bill scrapping the ORF&#x27;s &quot;Proporz&quot; arrangement was ultimately passed during the single-party ÖVP government of Josef Klaus in 1966, and came into effect in 1967.

&quot;Proporz&quot;, particularly the concept of consensus government, did not fade after the end of the first period of grand coalition. During the SPÖ majority governments of Bruno Kreisky in the 1970s and 1980s, the ÖVP was frequently consulted regarding government decisions and legislation; as such, the opposition was never truly shut out of decision-making.

===State level===
&quot;Proporz&quot; was written into the constitutions of most of the federal states in the 1940s. This particular implementation automatically entitled parties to cabinet positions if they won enough votes in state elections; in essence, proportional representation applied to the cabinet. Until 1999, every state government with the exception of Vorarlberg operated in this manner. This effectively meant that the typical conventions of parliamentary democracy did not apply, as the partisan composition of governments was determined automatically. However, investiture of cabinet ministers, including the Governor, typically required the approval of the state legislature.

Initially, this model effectively guaranteed the ÖVP and SPÖ joint dominance over state governments, as other parties were typically too small to win any more than one cabinet position. However, the rise in popularity of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and The Greens from the 1980s onwards saw the major parties increasingly forced to share their power. This form of &quot;Proporz&quot; has since been repealed in most states; first in Salzburg and Tyrol in 1999, then Styria and Burgenland in 2015, and Carinthia in 2017. The model in Vienna, which is based on the municipal implementation, allows governments to deny portfolio to ministers from the opposition. The original system only remains in force in Lower Austria and Upper Austria.

===Municipal level===
Most cities&#x27; statutes still provide for &quot;Proporz&quot; in city council positions, much the same as on the state level. Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Wiener Neustadt all have such regulations, and thus city councillors from the opposition.

==Criticism==
Critics of &quot;Proporz&quot; characterised it as a form of political patronage and nepotism in which officials were appointed or received benefits on the basis of their party membership. They claimed the long-standing grand coalition fostered complacency and lack of direction in government. In &quot;Conflict and Freedom: Towards a Service Class Society&quot; (1972), Ralf Dahrendorf criticised the &quot;Proporz&quot; system: &quot;The conversion of solidarity into individual action entails a withdrawal of energy from the battlefield and marketplace of politics.&quot; Sociologist and jurist Gustav Edward Kafka said in 1958 that &quot;Proporz&quot; had become so entrenched that &quot;one could say with good reason that most of the provisions of formal constitutional law, including republican form of government, could be changed without profound consequences, as long as this principle [Proporz] remains in force; yet the return to free political competition would be tantamount to a revolution, though it would not require changing a comma in the constitution.&quot;

==Legacy==
During Austria&#x27;s first annual word of the year selection in 1999, the jury was tasked with choosing a &quot;word of the century&quot;. They were unable to come to a decision, and instead chose &quot;Proporz&quot; as &quot;word of the half-century&quot;. They stated &quot;it has shaped Austrian politics and social life like no other term since 1945&quot;, and represents &quot;the exact opposite dynamic than existed previously in political life&quot;.

<text>Proposition 13 (officially named the People&#x27;s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation) is an amendment of the Constitution of California enacted during 1978, by means of the initiative process, to cap property taxes and limit property reassessments to when the property changes ownership, and to require a 2/3 majority for tax increases in the state legislature. The initiative was approved by California voters in a primary election on June 6, 1978, by a nearly two to one margin. It was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1992 in &quot;Nordlinger v. Hahn&quot;, . Proposition 13 is embodied in Article XIII A of the Constitution of the State of California.

The proposition decreased property taxes by assessing values at their 1976 value, limiting the rate of taxation to 1% of the assessed value, and restricting annual increases of assessed value to an inflation factor, not to exceed 2% per year. It prohibits reassessment of a new base year value except in cases of (a) change in ownership, or (b) completion of new construction. These rules apply equally to all real estate, residential and commercial—whether owned by individuals or corporations.

Significantly, the initiative also requires a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates. It also requires a two-thirds majority in local elections for local governments wishing to increase special taxes. (A &quot;special tax&quot; is a tax devoted specifically to a purpose: e.g. homelessness or road repair; money that does not go into a general fund.)

Proposition 13 has been described as California&#x27;s most famous and influential ballot measure; it received enormous publicity throughout the United States. Passage of the initiative presaged a &quot;taxpayer revolt&quot; throughout the country that is sometimes thought to have contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency during 1980. Of 30 anti-tax ballot measures that year, 13 passed. The proposition has been called the &quot;third rail&quot; (meaning &quot;untouchable subject&quot;) of California politics, and it has generally been unpopular for lawmakers to attempt to change it.

As a consequence of Proposition 13, homeowners in California receive a property subsidy that increases the longer that they own their home. It has been described as a contributor to California&#x27;s housing crisis, as its acquisition value system (where the assessed value of property is based on the date of its acquisition rather than current market value) incentivizes long-time homeowners to hold onto their properties rather than downsize, reducing the housing supply and raising housing prices.

== Purpose ==
=== Limit the tax rate for properties ===
Proposition 13 declared property taxes were to be assessed their 1976 value and restricted annual increases of the tax to an inflation factor, not to exceed 2% per year. A reassessment of the property tax can be made only when a) the property ownership changes or b) there is construction done.

===State responsibility===
The state has been given the responsibility of distributing the property tax revenues to local agencies.

===Voting requirements state taxes===
In addition to decreasing property taxes and changing the role of the state, Proposition 13 also contained language requiring a two-thirds (2/3) majority in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates and sales tax rates.

===Voting requirements local taxes===
Proposition 13 also requires two-thirds (2/3) voter approval for cities, counties, and special districts to impose special taxes. In &quot;Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood&quot;, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987), the California Court of Appeal for the Second District determined that the two-thirds (2/3) voter approval requirement for special taxes under Proposition 13 applied to citizens initiatives.

== Origins ==

There are several theories of the origins of Proposition 13. The evidence for or against these accounts varies.

===Displacement of retired homeowners===

One explanation is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising as a result of California&#x27;s population growth, continued growth in state and local government spending, increasing housing demand, government restrictions on new developments and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. A 2006 study published in &quot;Law &amp; Society Review&quot; supported this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.

Proposition 13 is not the only law in California designed to prevent tax-induced displacement. The California Tax Postponement Program, passed in 1977, ensures that “homeowners who are seniors, are blind, or have a disability to defer current-year property taxes on their principal residence if they meet certain criteria”.

===School funding equalization===

Another explanation is Proposition 13 drew its impetus from the 1971 and 1976 California Supreme Court rulings in &quot;Serrano v. Priest&quot;, which somewhat equalized California school funding by redistributing local property taxes from wealthy to poor school districts. According to this explanation, property owners in affluent districts perceived that the taxes they paid were no longer benefiting their local schools, and chose to cap their taxes.

A problem with this explanation is that the &quot;Serrano&quot; decision and school finance equalization were popular among California voters. While Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance equalization, Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the &quot;Serrano&quot; decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the &quot;Serrano&quot; decision and of school finance equalization.

===Regressive tax distributions ===

A 2020 study by Joshua Mound published in the &quot;Journal of Policy History&quot; challenged the idea that wealthy property owners&#x27; desire to cap their property taxes was the impetus for enacting Proposition 13, instead saying the &quot;tax revolt&quot; was rooted in lower and middle-income Americans&#x27; longstanding frustration with unfair and highly regressive tax distributions during the post-World War II decades.

The study said pro-growth Kennedy-Johnson &quot;Growth Liberals&quot; cut federal income taxes in the highest brackets in the 1960s while local officials raised regressive state and local taxes, creating a &quot;pocketbook squeeze&quot; that made voters less likely to approve local levies and bonds, which eventually led to the passage of Proposition 13. The study said the tax revolt was not limited to white voters nor associated with rising conservatism associated with the collapse of the &quot;New Deal order&quot; and the election of Ronald Reagan.

===Expansion of state government===

Another explanation that has been offered is that spending by California&#x27;s government had increased dramatically during the years prior to 1978, and voters sought to limit further growth. The evidence supporting this explanation is limited, as there have been no studies relating Californians&#x27; views on the size and role of government to their views on Proposition 13. It is true that California&#x27;s government had grown. Between 1973 and 1977, California state and local government expenditures per $1,000 of personal income were 8.2% higher than the national norm. From 1949 to 1979, public sector employment in California outstripped employment growth in the private sector. By 1978, 14.7% of California&#x27;s civilian work force were state and local government employees, almost double the proportion of the early 1950s.

===Junior college expansion===

One example of the massive expansion of government in California in the decades before Proposition 13 was the rapid growth of public postsecondary education. In 1900, California had only a single public university at Berkeley, the University of California, and state normal schools which provided two-year teacher training programs at Chico, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco. In 1907, the American junior college movement was launched in California when the state legislature authorized high schools to offer lower-division college-level coursework, thereby enabling more high school graduates to attempt such courses without having to move away for college.
California was the proud leader of this movement, in that the United States went from zero junior colleges in 1900 to nineteen by 1915, of which eight were based in California. 

In 1960, the Master Plan for Higher Education provided that junior colleges would be established within commuting distance of nearly all California residents, which required the founding of twenty-two new colleges on top of the sixty-four colleges already operating as of 1960. In 1967, the junior colleges were renamed &quot;community colleges&quot; and became part of the California Community Colleges system. 

Before Proposition 13, community college districts were able &quot;to levy certain taxes for special purposes without a vote of the public&quot;. Among these purposes were community services, fringe benefits, and child care. For example, before 1978, the North Orange County Community College District levied a special tax on all property owners in the district which funded a comprehensive health care plan generous enough to amount to an overall 4% increase in compensation for all employees. By severely curtailing the ability of community college districts to levy property taxes, Proposition 13 shifted the state&#x27;s contribution to community colleges from 38% to 78% of their revenue.

===Corruption===

During the early 1960s, there were several scandals in California involving county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led to the passage of Assembly Bill 80 (AB 80) in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only to be told that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. Cynicism about the favoritism of the tax system towards the wealthy and well-connected persisted into the 1970s. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.

== Measure ==

Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann were the most vocal and visible advocates of Proposition 13. Officially named the People&#x27;s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, and known popularly as the Jarvis-Gann Amendment, Proposition 13 was listed on the ballot through the California ballot initiative process, a provision of the California Constitution that allows a proposed law or constitutional amendment to be offered to voters if advocates collect a sufficient number of signatures on a petition. Proposition 13 passed with roughly two-thirds of those who voted in favor and with the participation of around two-thirds of registered voters. After passage, it became article XIII A of the California Constitution.

Under Proposition 13, the annual real estate tax on a parcel of property is limited to 1% of its assessed value. This &quot;assessed value&quot; may be increased only by a maximum of 2% per year until, and unless, the property has a change of ownership. At the time of the change in ownership the low assessed value may be reassessed to complete current market value that will produce a new base year value for the property, but future assessments are likewise restricted to the 2% annual maximum increase of the new base year value.

The property may be reassessed under certain conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if the market value of the property declines below its assessed value, such as during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed generally increases and decreases with the value of the property.

== Outcome ==


== Effects ==

=== Reduction in taxes ===

In the year after Proposition 13 was passed, property tax revenue to local governments declined by roughly 60% statewide. However, by 2003, the inflation-adjusted property tax collected by local governments exceeded the pre-1978 levels, and has continued to increase.

In 2009, the advocacy group Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association estimated that Proposition 13 had reduced taxes paid by California taxpayers by an aggregate $528 billion.

Other estimates show that Proposition 13 may not have reduced California&#x27;s overall per-capita tax burden or State spending. The think tank Tax Foundation reported that in 1978, Californians had the third highest tax burden as a proportion of state income (tax-per-capita divided by income-per-capita) of 12.4% ($3,300 tax per capita, inflation adjusted). By 2012, it had fallen slightly to the sixth highest rate, 10.9%, ($4,100 tax per capita, inflation adjusted).

California has the highest marginal income and capital gains tax rate and is in the top ten highest corporate tax and sales tax rates nationally. In 2016, California had the 17th-highest per-capita (per-person) property tax revenue in the country at $1,559, up from 31st in 1996. In 2019, WalletHub applied California&#x27;s statewide effective property tax rate of 0.77% to the state median home market value of $443,400; the annual property taxes of $3,414 on the median home value was the 9th-highest in the United States.

=== Property tax equity ===

Proposition 13 sets the assessed value of properties at the time of purchase (known as an acquisition value system), with a possible 2% annual assessment increase. As a result, properties of equal value can have a great amount of variation in their assessed value, even if they are next to each other. The disparity grows when property prices appreciate by more than 2% a year. The Case–Shiller housing index shows prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco appreciated 170% from 1987 (the start of available data) to 2012 while the 2% cap only allowed a 67% increase in taxes on homes that were not sold during this 26-year period.

A 1993 report from the joint University of California and State of California research program, California Policy Seminar (now the California Policy Research Center), said that a property tax system based on acquisition value links property tax liability to ability to pay and has a progressive impact on the tax structure, based on income. It said that a revenue-neutral Los Angeles County reform which raises all assessments to true market value and lowers the property tax rate would harm elderly and low-income households.

The think tank Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) considers property tax caps like Proposition 13 poorly targeted and instead advocates &quot;circuit breaker&quot; caps or homestead exemptions to levy property taxes based on ability to pay; yet in 2018, ITEP ranked California&#x27;s tax code as the most progressive in the United States, in part due to its high marginal income and capital gains rates. Since wealth is associated with ownership of &quot;intangible&quot; assets like stocks, bonds, or business equity, which are exempt from wealth taxes, ITEP says regressive state tax distributions that rely on property taxes on real property can worsen inequality, and that of all US states in 2018, California&#x27;s tax code reduced inequality the most.

=== Tenure of households ===

By comparing California over the period 1970 to 2000 with other states, (using data from the US Census Bureau, not state or county-level property records)
Wasi and White (2005) estimated that Proposition 13 caused homeowners to increase the duration of time spent in a given home by 9% (1.04 years), and renters to increase their tenure by 18% (0.79 years). 
They also estimated that this effect was more pronounced in the coastal cities, with the increase in tenancy by owner-occupiers in the Bay Area being predicted at 28% (3.0 years), Los Angeles 21% (2.3 years), and Fresno 7% (0.77 years).
They speculate that renters may have longer tenure due to less turnover of owner-occupied housing to move into.

Other studies have found that increased tenure in renting can be attributed in part to rent control.

===Funding volatility===

A 2016 report from the California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office found that property tax revenue to local governments was similarly volatile before and after the passage of Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 stabilized the base, prior to Proposition 13, governments would adjust the rate annually to counteract changes to the base.

=== Fiscal impact from new home construction ===

According to the California Building Industry Association, construction of a median priced house results in a slight positive fiscal impact, as opposed to the position that housing does not &quot;pay its own way&quot;. The trade association argues that this is because new homes are assessed at the value when they are first sold. Additionally, due to the higher cost of new homes, the trade association claims that new residents are more affluent and may provide more sales tax revenues and use less social services of the host community.

=== Taxes targeted to services ===

Others argue that the real reason for the claimed negative effects is lack of trust for elected officials to spend the public&#x27;s money wisely. Business improvement districts are one means by which property owners have chosen to tax themselves for additional government services. Property owners find that these targeted levies are more palatable than general taxes.

=== Sales disincentives, higher housing costs ===

Proposition 13 alters the balance of the housing market because it provides disincentives for selling property, in favor of remaining at the current property and modifying or transferring to family members to avoid a new, higher property tax assessment.

Proposition 13 reduces property tax revenue for municipalities in California. They are forced to rely more on state funding and therefore may lose autonomy and control. The amount of taxes available to the municipality in any given year largely depends on the number of property transfers taking place. Yet since existing property owners have an incentive to remain in their property and not sell, there are fewer property transfers under this type of property tax system.

California also has high rates of migrants from other countries and states, which has contributed to more demand for housing, and it has low amounts of moderately priced housing. The different tax treatment can make real estate more valuable to the current owner than to any potential buyer, so selling it often makes no economic sense.

=== Commercial property owners ===

Owners of commercial real estate benefited under the original rules of Proposition 13: If a corporation owning commercial property (such as a shopping mall) was sold or merged, but the property stayed technically deeded to the corporation, ownership of the property could effectively have changed without triggering Proposition 13&#x27;s reassessment provisions. These rules were subsequently changed; under current law, a change of control or ownership of a legal entity causes a reassessment of its real property as well as the real property of entities that it controls.

The application to commercial and rental property can lead to an advantage and profit margin for incumbent individuals or corporations who purchased property at a time when prices were low. This is in contrast to the initial campaign, where Jarvis argued that lowering property tax rates would cause landlords to pass savings onto renters, who were upset at their rapidly rising rents driven by the high inflation of the 1970&#x27;s. Most landlords did not do this, which became a motivating factor for rent control.

==== Property transfer loophole ====

Some businesses have exploited a property transfer loophole in Proposition 13 implementing statutes created by the California Legislature that define what constitutes a change in property ownership. To take advantage of this loophole, businesses only have to make sure that no partnership exceeds the 50% mark in control in order to avoid a reassessment. The Legislature could close this loophole with a 2/3 vote. In 2018, the California Board of Equalization estimated that closing this loophole would raise up to $269 million annually in new tax revenue. There have been several legislative attempts to close the loophole, none of which have been successful.

Proponents of split roll have said the intent of Proposition 13 was to protect residential property taxes from spiking and say the broad application of Proposition 13 to commercial property is a loophole while opponents say voters deliberately sought to extend Proposition 13 protections to commercial property by rejecting a split roll measure promoted by then-Governor Jerry Brown, Proposition 8, in 1978 (on the same ballot as Proposition 13), by a vote of 53–47%, and instead passed Proposition 13 with nearly 65% of the vote. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article published shortly following the passage of Proposition 13 supported the latter interpretation, stating: &quot;There is no question that the voters knew exactly what they were doing. Indeed, The Los Angeles Times-Channel 2 News Survey, in which almost 2,500 voters filled out questionnaires as they left the polls Tuesday, revealed that Propositions 8 [the split roll alternative] and 13 were seen by most voters as mutually exclusive alternatives, even though it was entirely possible for voters to play it safe by voting for both measures. Among those who voted for Proposition 13, only one in five also voted for Proposition 8, while Proposition 8 was endorsed by fully 91% of those who voted &quot;no&quot; on Proposition 13. Proposition 13 was advertised as a stronger tax relief measure than Proposition 8. That is exactly how the voters saw it, and that is exactly what they wanted.&quot;

=== Sales and other taxes ===

==== Other taxes created or increased ====

Local governments in California now use imaginative strategies to maintain or increase revenue due to Proposition 13 and the attendant loss of property tax revenue (which formerly went to cities, counties, and other local agencies). For instance, many California local governments have recently sought voter approval for special taxes such as parcel taxes for public services that used to be paid for entirely or partially from property taxes imposed before Proposition 13 became law. Provision for such taxes was made by the 1982 Community Facilities Act (more commonly known as Mello-Roos). Sales tax rates have also increased from 6% (pre-Proposition 13 level) to 7.25% and higher in some local jurisdictions.

In 1991, the Supreme Court of California ruled in &quot;Rider v. County of San Diego&quot; that a San Diego County sales tax to fund jail and courthouse construction was unconstitutional. The court ruled that because the tax money was targeted towards specific programs rather than general spending, it counted as a &quot;special tax&quot; under Proposition 13 and required approval by two-thirds of the voters, whereas the tax had passed with a simple majority.

The imposition of these special taxes and fees was a target of California Proposition 218 (&quot;Right to Vote on Taxes Act&quot;) which passed in 1996. It constitutionally requires voter approval for local government taxes and some nontax levies such as benefit assessments on real property and certain property-related fees and charges.

=== Cities and localities ===

==== Greater effect on coastal metropolitan areas than on rest of state ====

Proposition 13 disproportionately affects coastal metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, where housing prices are higher, relative to inland communities with lower housing prices. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, more research would show whether benefits of Proposition 13 outweigh the redistribution of tax base and overall cost in lost tax revenue.

==== Loss of local government power to state government ====
Local governments have become more dependent on state funds, which has increased state power over local communities. The state provides &quot;block grants&quot; to cities to provide services, and bought out some facilities that locally administer state-mandated programs. &quot;The Economist&quot; argued in 2011 that &quot;for all its small government pretensions, Proposition 13 ended up centralizing California&#x27;s finances, shifting them from local to state government.&quot;

==== Resultant planning changes, cost or degradation of services, new fees ====

Due to the reduction in revenue generated from property tax, local governments have become more dependent on sales taxes for general revenue funds. Some maintain that this trend resulted in the &quot;fiscalization of land use&quot;, meaning that land use decisions are influenced by the ability of a new development to generate revenue. Proposition 13 has increased the incentive for local governments to attract new commercial developments, such as big box retailers and car dealerships instead of residential housing developments, because of commercial development&#x27;s ability to generate revenue through sales tax and business licenses tax. This may discourage growth of other sectors and job types that may provide better opportunities for residents. In terms of public services, office and retail development are further incentivized because they do not cost the local governments as much as residential developments. Additionally, cities have decreased services and increased fees to compensate for the shortfall, with particularly high impact fees levied on developers to impose the cost of the additional services and infrastructure that new developments will require. These costs are typically shifted to the building&#x27;s buyer, who may be unaware of the thousands in fees included with the building&#x27;s cost.

=== Education and public services ===

==== Effect on public schools ====

California&#x27;s K-12 public schools, which during the 1960s had been ranked nationally as among the best, deteriorated substantially in many surveys of student achievement, according to a 2005 RAND study.
Some disputed the attribution of the decline to Proposition 13&#x27;s role in the change to state financing of public schools, because schools financed mostly by property taxes were declared unconstitutional (the variances in funding between lower and higher income areas being deemed to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution) in &quot;Serrano vs. Priest&quot;, and Proposition 13 was then passed partially as a result of that case. California&#x27;s spending per pupil was the same as the national average until about 1985, when it began decreasing, which resulted in another referendum, Proposition 98, that requires a certain percentage of the state&#x27;s budget to be directed towards public education.

Prior to implementation of Proposition 13, the state of California saw significant increases in property tax revenue collection &quot;with the share of state and local revenues derived from property taxes increasing from 34% at the turn of the decade to 44% in 1978 (Schwartz 1998).&quot; Proposition 13 caused a sharp decrease in state and local tax collection in its first year.

One measure of K-12 public school spending is the percentage of personal income that a state spends on education. From a peak of about 4.5% for the nation overall, and 4.0% for California, both peaking in the early 1970s, the nation overall as well as California spent declining percentages on public education in the decade from 1975 to 1985.
For the longer period of 1970–2008, California had always spent a lower percentage than the rest of the nation on education.

UCSD Economics Professor Julian Betts stated in a 2010 interview: &quot;What all this means for spending is that starting around 1978–1979 we saw a sharp reduction in spending on schools. We fell compared to other states dramatically, and we still haven&#x27;t really caught up to other states.&quot; From 1977 up until 2010, in California there had been a steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, &quot;which have been decreasing since 1970.&quot; During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, &quot;measured in 1997–1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969–1970 than did the rest of the country.&quot; From 1981 to 1982 up until 2000, California had consistently spent less per student than the rest of the U.S., as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California. This resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observed in 2010 that &quot;pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between pupil-teacher ratios here and in the rest of the country, and we still haven&#x27;t recovered from that.&quot;

California&#x27;s voters would approve higher income and capital gains tax rates on the state&#x27;s wealthiest residents to increase K-12 school funding in subsequent years: voters approved tax increases with Proposition 30 in 2012 (which was extended to 2030 with 2016 California Proposition 55), raising tax rates on income and capital gains over $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for joint filers, with most of the resultant revenue going to schools. These measures significantly closed the K-12 spending gap between California and the national average. Pupil-teacher ratios decreased since the passage of Proposition 30, and according to a National Education Association survey, California had the second-highest starting teacher salary among the 50 states in 2018. In addition to the &quot;Serrano v. Priest&quot; decision which equalized school funding between school districts, in 2013, California lawmakers created the Local Control Funding Formula, providing greater resources to school districts with student populations having higher needs, being determined by the rate of children in poverty or foster care and the rate of English language learners in the district, and adding an additional 20% or more in &quot;supplemental funding&quot; to disadvantaged school districts.

== Popularity ==

Proposition 13 is consistently popular among California&#x27;s likely voters, 64% of whom were homeowners as of 2017. A 2018 survey from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 57% of Californians say that Proposition 13 is mostly a good thing, while 23% say it is mostly a bad thing. 65% of likely voters say it has been mostly a good thing, as do: 71% of Republicans, 55% of Democrats, and 61% of independents; 54% of people age 18 to 34, 52% of people age 35 to 54, and 66% of people 55 and older; 65% of homeowners and 50% of renters. The only demographic group for which less than 50% said that Proposition 13 was mostly a good thing was African Americans, at 39%.

The survey also found that 40% of Californians, and 50% of likely voters said that Proposition 13&#x27;s supermajority requirement for new special taxes has had a good effect on local government services provided to residents, while 20% of both Californians and likely voters said it had a bad effect, and the remainder felt it had no effect.

At the same time, a majority of both Californians (55%) and likely voters (56%) opposed lowering the supermajority threshold for local special taxes.

=== Third rail ===

Proposition 13 is often considered the &quot;third rail&quot; of California politics, which means that politicians avoid discussions of changing it.

In the 2003 California recall election in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor, his advisor Warren Buffett suggested that Proposition 13 be repealed or changed as a method of balancing the state&#x27;s budget. Schwarzenegger, believing that such an act would be inadvisable politically and could end his gubernatorial career, said, &quot;I told Warren that if he mentions Proposition 13 again he has to do 500 sit-ups.&quot;

Gavin Newsom, when asked about the fairness of Proposition 13 in a 2010 interview with &quot;The Bay Citizen&quot;, said: &quot;The political realities are such that Democrats, not just Republicans and Independents, are overwhelmingly opposed to making adjustments in terms of the residential side of Prop. 13. On the commercial and industrial side, there seems to be a lot more openness to debate...Of course, it&#x27;s a difficult time to do that...when you&#x27;re trying to encourage manufacturing back into your state, and you already have a cost differential between states that border us, you don&#x27;t want to now increase their burden in terms of property tax on that commercial and industrial space.&quot;

In 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown was quoted as saying that it wasn&#x27;t Proposition 13 that was the problem, but &quot;It was what the Legislature did after 13, it was what happened after 13 was passed&quot; because the legislature reduced local authorities&#x27; power. In a later interview in 2014, he lamented that he hadn&#x27;t built up a &quot;war chest&quot; with which to campaign for an alternative to Proposition 13. Governor Brown said he&#x27;d learned from his failure in the mid-1970s to build a war chest that he could have used to push an alternative to Proposition 13. Governor Brown was definitive that he would not seek to change the law, a third rail in California politics. &quot;Prop. 13 is a sacred doctrine that should never be questioned,&quot; he said.

== Amendments ==

=== 1978 Proposition 8 ===

Proposition 8 allows for a reassessment of real property values in a declining market.

=== 1986 Proposition 58 ===

Proposition 58 allowed homeowners to transfer their principal residence to children without a property tax re-assessment, as well as the first $1 million (not indexed to inflation) in assessed value of other real property. It passed with 76% of the vote.

Between Proposition 58 and 1996 Proposition 193, which extends Proposition 58 to grandparents, a 2017 report from California&#x27;s Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office (LAO) found that roughly one out of 20 houses statewide received the exemption in the decade ending in 2015, at an average rate of one out of every 200 houses per year. They estimated total foregone yearly property tax revenue for all exemptions ever received at $1.5 billion in 2015, or about 2.5% of total statewide property tax revenue. The report said that while the exemption made it possible for some to live in their parents&#x27; house, it likely incentivized the conversion of inherited houses into rental property or other uses. The report said the exemption probably created downward pressure on rents while causing more Californians to be renters rather than homeowners.

=== 1986 Proposition 60 ===

Proposition 60 allows homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer the assessed value of their present home to a replacement home if the replacement home is located in the same county, is of equal or lesser value, and purchased within two years of sale.

=== 1988 Proposition 90 ===

Proposition 90 was similar to 1986 Proposition 60 in that it allowed homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer the assessed value of their present home to a replacement home if the replacement home was located in a different county, provided the incoming county allowed the transfer.

=== 1996 Proposition 193 ===

Proposition 193 extended 1986 Proposition 58 by allowing grandparents to transfer to their grandchildren their primary residence and up to $1 million (not indexed to inflation) in other real property without a property tax re-assessment, when both parents of the grandchild are deceased. It passed with 67% of the vote.

=== 1996 Proposition 218 ===

Proposition 218, called the &quot;Right to Vote on Taxes Act,&quot; is an initiative constitutional amendment approved by California voters on November 5, 1996. Proposition 218 was sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association as a constitutional follow-up to Proposition 13.

The proposition established constitutional limits on the ability of local governments to levy benefit assessments on real property and property-related fees and charges such as those for utility services to property. The assessment and property-related fee and charge reforms contained in Proposition 218 were in response to California local governments&#x27; use of revenue sources that circumvented the two-thirds vote requirement to raise local taxes under Proposition 13.

It also requires voter approval before a local government, including a charter city, may impose, increase, or extend any local tax. It also constitutionally reserves to local voters the right to use the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge, including provision for a significantly reduced petition signature requirement to qualify a measure on the ballot.

=== 2000 Proposition 39 ===

Proposition 39 lowered the required supermajority necessary for voters to impose local school bond acts from two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast to 55%.

=== 2010 Proposition 26 ===

Proposition 26 added a constitutional definition of &quot;tax&quot; for purposes of the two-thirds legislative vote requirement for state taxes under Proposition 13.

=== 2020 Proposition 19 ===
Following the defeat of Proposition 5 in 2018, the California Association of Realtors sponsored another measure similar to their prior initiative. It appeared on the November 2020 ballot and was approved by voters by a narrow margin. This measure provides reassessment exemptions to all homeowners over the age of 55 moving within the state, for a total of three lifetime moves, financed by narrowing Proposition 58 and Proposition 193 to solely inherited primary residences or farms, with an inflation-adjusted exemption cap of $1 million in market value at the time of death, and requires the heir to continually live in the residence or face reassessment (this requirement does not apply to farm property).

== Failed attempts at change or repeal ==

Since its passage in 1978, there have been many attempts to change Proposition 13 through legislation, legal challenges, and additional ballot measures. In 1992, a legal challenge (&quot;Nordlinger v. Hahn&quot;) was considered by the United States Supreme Court, which subsequently ruled 8–1 that Proposition 13 didn&#x27;t violate the Equal Protection clause, and found Nordlinger didn&#x27;t have standing to raise a Right to Travel claim.

=== Legal challenges ===
==== &quot;Amador Valley Joint Union High School District v. State Board of Equalization&quot; (1978)====
&quot;Amador Valley Joint Union High School District v. State Board of Equalization&quot; was a California Supreme Court case in which the aforementioned school district challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 13. In the ruling, the state&#x27;s high court confirmed that an initiative cannot &quot;revise&quot; the constitution; Proposition 13, however, was an amendment to the California Constitution and not a revision.

==== &quot;Nordlinger v. Hahn&quot; (1992)====
Stephanie Nordlinger had purchased a property in the Los Angeles area in 1988 and, under the provisions of Proposition 13, was required to have the property reassessed at a new value. The reassessed value of Nordlinger&#x27;s property raised her tax rates by 36%, while her neighbors continued to pay significantly lower rates on their property. Disheartened by the disparity in taxation, Nordlinger viewed this reassessment as favoritism in the eyes of the law and elected to bring charges up on the Los Angeles County Tax Assessment office and its primary assessor, Kenneth Hahn.

Nordlinger subsequently sued the Los Angeles County Tax Assessor Kenneth Hahn on the grounds of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court held in &quot;Nordlinger v. Hahn&quot; that Proposition 13 was constitutional. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing the majority opinion, noted that California had a &quot;legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability&quot; and that it was acceptable to treat owners who have invested for some time in property differently from new owners. One who objected to the rules could choose not to buy.

Nordlinger also raised a right to travel argument—however, justices found that she lacked standing, as she wasn&#x27;t impeded from moving to California by Proposition 13.

Thirty years after purchasing her house, Nordlinger, now a senior citizen on a limited income, paid $3,400 a year in property taxes on the house, which had increased in value to $900,000.

==== Other legal challenges ====
In December 2011, Charles E. Young, former University of California, Los Angeles chancellor, brought a lawsuit with a team of lawyers headed by William Norris, a retired federal judge of the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. They unsuccessfully sued to overturn the Proposition 13 requirement that a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Legislature is required to increase state taxes.

=== Recent attempts ===

==== Legislative attempts to close the property transfer loophole (2014, 2015, 2018, and 2020) ====

The property transfer loophole was almost closed in 2014 by a bipartisan coalition in the state legislature but the effort died after progressive politicians, organized labor, and community groups refused to support the effort. In 2015 and 2018, Republican efforts to fix this loophole were stalled by Democratic state legislators in legislative committee. Another Republican attempt to close the loophole was made in 2020. Democrat Don Perata, former California senate leader, said this loophole is left open by his party to create justification for ending Proposition 13.

==== 2018 Proposition 5 ====

Proposition 5 would have extended 1986 California Proposition 60 and 1988 California Proposition 90 by providing property tax savings to all homeowners who are over age 55 (or who meet other qualifications) when they move to a different home. It was sponsored by the California Association of Realtors.
California&#x27;s Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office estimated that this would cost local governments about $100 million per year over the first few years, growing to $1 billion per year (in 2018 dollars) over time.
It was defeated on November 6, 2018, with approximately 58% of voters not in favor.

==== 2020 California Proposition 15 ====

Proposition 15 (also known as split roll) was an initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the November 2020 California statewide ballot that would have raised taxes by amending Proposition 13 to require the reassessment of commercial and industrial properties at market value, including commercial and industrial property owned by a natural person. The measure failed to pass, with 52% of votes cast in opposition to the measure.

Proponents of the measure were outspent by the opposition, with supporters having spent $69 million while opponents spent $74 million.  The main donors to Yes on Prop. 15 were the California Teachers Association, multiple chapters of the Service Employees International Union, and the Chan Zuckerberg Advocacy Fund. The main opposition donors were corporate and business oriented groups including the California Business Roundtable, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the Business Property Association, and the real estate industry.

<text>King Lie of Zhou (), personal name Ji Xi, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty. He reigned from 375 BC to his death in 369 BC. His father was King An.

During the reign of King Lie of Zhou, Duke Xian of Qin relocated the capital to Yueyang (in present-day Yanliang District of Xi&#x27;an), which marked the start of Qin&#x27;s prosperity. In 371 BC, Duke Xian of Qin led troops to conquer six cities of the Han state. In 370 BC, King Wei of Qi visited the Zhou court, further solidifying his reputation.
