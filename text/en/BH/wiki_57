<text>Donald Kent &quot;Deke&quot; Slayton (March 1, 1924 – June 13, 1993) was an American Air Force pilot, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts. He went on to become NASA&#x27;s first Chief of the Astronaut Office and Director of Flight Crew Operations, responsible for NASA crew assignments.

Slayton joined the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, and flew in Europe and the Pacific. He left the Army after World War II, went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from University of Minnesota in 1949, and later joined the Minnesota Air National Guard after working for Boeing as an aeronautical engineer. He joined the United States Air Force, and attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in 1955. In 1959, he applied to, and was selected as one of the Mercury Seven, NASA&#x27;s first class of astronauts. Slayton was scheduled to pilot the second U.S. crewed orbital spaceflight, but was grounded in 1962 by atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. In March 1972, he was medically cleared to fly and was the docking module pilot of the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). Slayton continued to work at NASA until 1982. He also helped develop the Space Shuttle.

Slayton died from brain cancer on June 13, 1993, aged 69.

==Early life and career==

Donald Kent Slayton was born on March 1, 1924, on a farm near Leon, Wisconsin, to Charles Sherman Slayton (1887–1972) and Victoria Adelia Slayton (; 1895–1970). He was of English and Norwegian descent. From a young age, he worked on the farm to raise sheep and cows, and grow tobacco. Throughout Slayton&#x27;s childhood, his family&#x27;s home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. At the age of five, Slayton was clearing a horse-drawn hay mower when his left ring finger was severed. He attended a two-room elementary school in Leon, and graduated from Sparta High School in 1942, where he boxed, played trombone, and was active in the Future Farmers of America (FFA).

===World War II===
The 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Empire occurred during Slayton&#x27;s senior year of high school. He initially wished to join the U.S. Navy, but joined the U.S. Army Air Forces when it began accepting high school graduates to fly. After graduation, Slayton moved to San Antonio, Texas, and entered the Aviation Cadet Training Program. He was initially medically delayed because of his severed ring finger, but was deemed able to fly. Slayton began flight training in Vernon, Texas, where he trained on the Fairchild PT-19, the PT-17 Stearman, and the AT-6 Texan. After three months of primary training, Slayton moved to Waco, Texas, for basic flight training, where he flew the BT-13 Valiant. Despite Slayton&#x27;s wishes to fly single-engine fighter aircraft, he was selected to fly multi-engine aircraft. Slayton began multi-engine training on the Beechcraft AT-10, Cessna AT-17, and the Curtiss AT-9. Slayton graduated from flight training on April 22, 1943, and was assigned to fly on the B-25 Mitchell, his last choice for aircraft.

Slayton moved to Columbia Army Air Base in South Carolina for the three-month-long B-25 Mitchell training. After completing training, he was assigned to the 340th Bombardment Group, and departed for the European theater of operations on ship from Newport News, Virginia. After a stop in Zerni, North Africa, his convoy traveled to Naples, Italy. While traveling near the Strait of Gibraltar, their ships came under attack from German bombers and submarines. After he arrived in Naples, the 340th Bombardment Group moved to San Petrazio, where Slayton flew combat missions into the Balkan Peninsula. After six weeks, he moved to Foggia, where 48 aircraft were destroyed after an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Afterwards, Slayton flew out of Salerno and Corsica, where he upgraded from copilot to pilot. After 56 combat sorties, Slayton completed his combat tour and returned to the U.S. in May 1944.

Immediately upon his return to Columbia Army Air Base to serve as a B-25 instructor, Slayton applied and was accepted to fly the new A-26 Invader bomber aircraft. He moved to Selfridge Field in Michigan for training, and began preparing for a deployment to the Pacific. In July 1945, he arrived on Okinawa Island and joined the 319th Bombardment Group. He flew seven combat missions over Japan, and encountered little Japanese resistance. Slayton flew his final combat mission on August 12, three days after the bombing of Nagasaki and spent two months waiting for his return to the U.S. After the war, Slayton worked as B-25 instructor in Albany, Georgia, and Boca Raton, Florida and separated from the Army in November 1946.

===Post-World War II===
After he was discharged from the Army, Slayton enrolled at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, and studied aeronautical engineering. As a student, he supported himself using the GI Bill and by working at a Montgomery Ward warehouse. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1949, and accepted a job as an engineer with the Boeing Aircraft Corporation at Seattle, Washington. After moving to Seattle, Slayton lived in a rooming house and began working as a junior design engineer. While at Boeing, he worked on the B-52 Stratofortress and the KC-97 Stratofreighter.

While he was a college student, Slayton joined the Air Force Reserve, and was a T-6 Texan pilot flying out of Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. He transitioned to the Minnesota Air National Guard (ANG), after accepting a demotion from captain to second lieutenant, to allow him to fly the A-26 Invader and P-51 Mustang. He left the Minnesota ANG when he moved to Seattle. Slayton attempted to join an Air Force Reserve unit in Seattle at the start of the Korean War, but was rejected on the grounds that his inactive reserve status had expired. He contacted his previous squadron commander in Minnesota and accepted his offer to rejoin his former squadron in February 1951. Upon his return, Slayton was initially medically disqualified from flying for his eyesight. He served as a maintenance officer while waiting for his medical clearance and then became a maintenance flight test officer once he had returned to flying status.

In 1952, Slayton transferred to active duty Air Force from the Air National Guard. After completing his education at Air Command and Staff School, he was assigned as a maintenance inspector at Twelfth Air Force Headquarters in Wiesbaden Army Airfield, West Germany. He additionally served as an F-86 Sabre pilot and maintenance officer with the 36th Fighter Day Wing at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany. While stationed in Germany, he met Marjorie Lunney and married her on May 18, 1955.

At the start of his assignment in West Germany, Slayton applied to the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS), but was rejected on the basis that he had to complete his current three-year assignment. He reapplied and was accepted in 1955, and joined TPS Class 55C. After graduating in December 1955, he became a test pilot at the Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He tested the F-101, F-102, F-104, F-105 and F-106. He was first assigned to the F-102, and tested the Matador and Genie missiles, and later tested the stall-spin characteristics of the F-105. In 1958, he helped test Britain&#x27;s first supersonic fighter, the English Electric P1B Lightning.

== NASA career ==

=== Mercury Seven ===

In January 1959, Slayton was selected as one of the candidates for NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury, the first U.S. crewed space flight program. Despite his initial lack of interest in spaceflight, he agreed to pursue astronaut selection. After an initial interview at the temporary NASA headquarters in the Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., Slayton was psychologically and physically tested at the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, along with fellow future astronauts Scott Carpenter and Jim Lovell. On April 2, 1959, Slayton was notified of his selection as an astronaut. He moved his family from Edwards Air Force Base to a housing development near Fort Eustis, where he was neighbors with fellow Mercury Seven astronauts Gus Grissom and Wally Schirra.

After he began at NASA, Slayton was assigned to the development of the Convair Atlas LV-3B. In 1959, during a centrifuge training course, he underwent an electrocardiogram that found that he had erratic heart activity. He received further medical evaluation at Brooks Air Force Base and was diagnosed with idiopathic atrial fibrillation, but he was considered healthy enough to continue flying. During the uncrewed Mercury-Atlas 4 orbital spaceflight, he worked at the tracking station in Bermuda. He was selected for the second American crewed orbital mission, Mercury-Atlas 7, which he intended to name &quot;Delta 7&quot;. In early 1962, NASA Administrator James Webb opened an investigation into Slayton&#x27;s atrial fibrillation. On March 15, 1962, two months prior to the launch of &quot;Delta 7&quot;, Slayton was medically disqualified from the flight and replaced on the mission by Scott Carpenter. Initially, Slayton&#x27;s ineligibility was only for his assigned mission, and he attempted to improve his health by exercising more regularly and abstaining from alcohol. NASA leadership determined that Slayton was still at risk for atrial fibrillation and removed his eligibility to fly any of the remaining Mercury missions. Flight doctors recommended a cardiac catheterization to determine if he had a congenital condition, but NASA management rejected the proposal because of the risks of the operation.

=== NASA management ===

After being grounded by NASA, Slayton was selected in early 1962 to serve as the senior manager of the astronaut office. One of his first roles was to select the Group 2 astronauts, and the new class was announced in September 1962. Additionally, he was tasked with making future crew assignments, and assigned Gordon Cooper to Mercury-Atlas 9. In an administrative restructuring in October 1963, Slayton became assistant director of Flight Crew Operations, in addition to his job managing the astronaut office. In November 1963, he resigned from his commission in the Air Force after he was permanently disqualified from flying and became a civilian executive for NASA. After Alan Shepard was grounded due to Ménière&#x27;s disease, he replaced Slayton as the manager of the astronaut office, while Slayton continued to work for Flight Crew Operations and was promoted to its director in 1966. Slayton continued to be responsible for making crew assignments, and determined the astronauts that would fly on the Gemini and Apollo missions. Slayton created a crew rotation, where a crew would be selected as the backup crew for a mission and would later be the prime crew three missions later.

During the Apollo 1 fire, Slayton was in the Cape Canaveral LC-34 blockhouse. He was a close friend of fellow astronaut Gus Grissom and had considered working inside the capsule to determine communications problems and would have worked under the footrests, where the fire would later begin. After the fire, Slayton called a meeting of the astronauts from the first groups to be chosen, in April 1967 and announced that they were the candidates for the first lunar landing. Slayton oversaw the crew reassignments for the upcoming Apollo missions, as well as the selection for Group 6 and Group 7 astronauts. During this time, he continued to show symptoms of atrial fibrillation. After NASA Administrator James Webb decided that Apollo 8 would become a circumlunar mission, Slayton switched the previous crew to the Apollo 9 because of their experience with the lunar module and moved both the prime and backup crew from Apollo 9 to Apollo 8. Due to his crew rotation schedule, the backup crew of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins became the primary crew for Apollo 11. Slayton continued to assign the crew for the remaining lunar landings. Slayton chose to replace Ken Mattingly with Jack Swigert on Apollo 13, after concerns arose that Mattingly could develop measles during the mission. In 1969, he made the controversial decision to assign Alan Shepard as the Apollo 13 commander, which was viewed by some astronauts as a conflict of interest, due to Shepard&#x27;s previous position as head of the astronaut office. Shepard would be later reassigned to command Apollo 14, against Slayton&#x27;s wishes, by the Office of Manned Spaceflight director George Mueller, who felt that Shepard needed additional training time. After the postal covers scandal during the Apollo 15 mission, Slayton reassigned the crew to non-flying jobs, effectively ending their astronaut careers. Slayton supported keeping Joe Engle as the lunar module pilot on Apollo 17, but was pressured by NASA management to replace him with Jack Schmitt, a scientist-astronaut.

=== Return to flight status ===
While grounded, Slayton took several measures to attempt to be restored to flight status, including regularly exercising, taking vitamins, quitting cigarette smoking and coffee and reducing his consumption of alcoholic beverages. In 1970 his palpitations became more frequent and he started taking experimental daily doses of quinidine, a crystalline alkaloid. This treatment was successful, but concerned that taking medication would still disqualify him from solo flying, Slayton stopped taking it against doctors orders. After a decade of seeing doctors around the world, in 1971 Slayton was examined at the Mayo Clinic after a long period without heart fibrillation, and was determined to not have a coronary condition. On March 13, 1972, NASA announced that Slayton had returned to flight status.

=== Apollo–Soyuz flight ===
In February 1973, Slayton was assigned to the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) as a docking module pilot, along with commander Thomas Stafford and command module pilot Vance Brand. The American crew began a two-year training program, which included learning the Russian language and making trips to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in the USSR. He remained in a managerial role throughout the Skylab program, and resigned as Director of Flight Crew Operations in February 1974 in preparation for his upcoming flight.

The Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft both launched on July 15, 1975. On July 17, the two craft rendezvoused in orbit and the American astronauts conducted crew transfers with cosmonauts Alexei Leonov and Valeri Kubasov. At the end of the flight, an erroneous switch setting led to noxious nitrogen tetroxide fumes from the command module&#x27;s RCS thrusters being sucked into the cabin during landing and the crew was hospitalized as a precaution in Honolulu, Hawaii, for two weeks. During hospitalization, a lesion was discovered on Slayton&#x27;s lung and removed. It was determined to be benign, but he would have likely been grounded from ASTP if it had been discovered before the flight. He was 51 years old, making him the oldest astronaut to fly in space at the time.

===Space Shuttle program===

Prior to the ASTP flight, Slayton was assigned by Chris Kraft to manage the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) of the Space Shuttle program. The ALT program developed the tests for the Space Shuttle orbiter &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and modified several F-104 Starfighters and T-38 Talons to train the astronauts. While working on the Space Shuttle, he also assisted in developing the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.

The ALT program ended in late 1977 and Slayton agreed to manage the Space Shuttle&#x27;s Orbital Flight Tests (OFT). During the selection of the Group 8 astronauts, Slayton advocated for fewer selections, with the expectation that two-man crews would fly the regular satellite deployment missions. He officially retired in 1980, but continued to serve in an advisory role for STS-1, and flew a T-38 chase plane during the landing of STS-2. He formally left NASA on February 27, 1982, and had flown 7,164 hours.

==Post-NASA career==
After his retirement from NASA, Slayton served as president of Space Services Inc., a Houston-based company earlier founded to develop rockets for small commercial payloads. He served as mission director for a rocket called the Conestoga, which was successfully launched on September 9, 1982, and was the world&#x27;s first privately funded rocket to reach space. Slayton also became interested in aviation racing, and was President of International Formula One Pylon Air Racing and Director of Columbia Astronautics. He also served on the Department of Transportation&#x27;s Commercial Space Advisory Committee.

In 1991, Slayton began working with space historian Michael Cassutt to write his autobiography, titled &quot;Deke!: U.S. Manned Space from Mercury to the Shuttle&quot;, which was published in 1994, a year after his death. Slayton also co-wrote the 1994 book &quot;Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America&#x27;s Race to the Moon&quot; with fellow astronaut Alan Shepard.

==Personal life==
Slayton married Marjorie &quot;Marge&quot; Lunney (1921–1989) on May 18, 1955, and they had one son. They divorced in April 1978, and Slayton moved to a condominium near the Johnson Space Center. He married Bobbie Belle Jones (1945–2010), who also worked at NASA, in October 1983, and they remained married until his death.

When Slayton was a test pilot, one of his pilot colleagues was also named Don. In order to avoid confusion in radio communications, Slayton was referred to by his initials, D.K., which were eventually shortened to &quot;Deke.&quot;

In 1992, Slayton was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. On June 13, 1993, he died in his home in League City, Texas, from the illness, at the age of 69. He was cremated and his ashes scattered over his family farm in Sparta, Wisconsin.

==Awards and honors==
Slayton&#x27;s military and NASA decorations:

During and after his career, Slayton received numerous awards from different organizations. He received the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) James H. Doolittle Award in 1972 and the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award. In 1975, he received the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal, the Zeta Beta Tau&#x27;s Richard Gottheil Medal, and the Wright Brothers International Manned Space Flight Award. In 1976, he received the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Space Award, the American Heart Association&#x27;s Heart of the Year Award, the District 35-R Lions International American of the Year Award, and the AAS Flight Achievement Award. In 1977, he received the AIAA Special Presidential Citation, the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Outstanding Achievement Award, and the Houston Area Federal Business Association&#x27;s Civil Servant of the Year Award. Slayton, along with Brand and Kubasov, won the FAI Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal in 1976. Additionally, he received the Collier Trophy, the Gen. Billy Mitchell Award, and the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award for 1978. Slayton received an Honorary D.Sc. from Carthage College in 1961, and an Honorary Doctorate in Engineering from Michigan Technological University in 1965.

He was a fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and the American Astronautical Society, as well as an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He was a member of the Experimental Aircraft Association, the Space Pioneers, the Confederate Air Force, the Order of Daedalians, the National Rifle Association of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. Additionally, he was an honorary member of the American Fighter Aces Association, the National WWII Glider Pilots Association and the Association of Space Explorers.

Deke Slayton was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on May 11, 1990, the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990, the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1996, and the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in 2001. The Texas Oncology-Deke Slayton Cancer Center in Webster, Texas, is named in his honor. The main stretch of road in League City, Texas, FM 518, was renamed Deke Slayton Highway. The Deke Slayton Memorial Space &amp; Bicycle Museum in Sparta, Wisconsin was named in his honor. The Slayton biographical exhibit includes his Mercury space suit, his Ambassador of Exploration Award, which showcases a lunar sample, and more. In nearby La Crosse, Wisconsin, an annual summer aircraft air show, the Deke Slayton Airfest, has been held in his honor, featuring modern and vintage military and civilian aircraft, along with NASA speakers.

Although the October 2014, Cygnus CRS Orb-3 mission named the S.S. &quot;Deke Slayton&quot; was lost when its Antares rocket exploded during launch, the Cygnus CRS Orb-4 Orbital ATK space vehicle S.S. &quot;Deke Slayton II&quot; was successfully launched to the International Space Station on an Atlas V rocket on December 6, 2015. In 2017, Solstar and NASA developed a preliminary design for Slayton Space Communicator (SC-Slayton), a commercial router on the International Space Station named in his honor. The device is intended for low Earth orbit service (LEO).

<text>Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse (13 November 1504 – 31 March 1567), nicknamed  (), was a German nobleman and champion of the Protestant Reformation, notable for being one of the most important of the early Protestant rulers in Germany. He was one of the main belligerents in the War of the Katzenelnbogen Succession.

==Biography==

===Early life and embracing of Protestantism===
Philip was the son of Landgrave William II of Hesse and his second wife Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His father died when Philip was five years old, and in 1514 his mother, after a series of struggles with the Estates of Hesse, succeeded in becoming regent on his behalf. The struggles over authority continued, however. To put an end to them, Philip was declared of age in 1518, his actual assumption of power beginning the following year. The power of the Estates had been broken by his mother, but he owed her little else. His education had been very imperfect, and his moral and religious training had been neglected. Despite all this, he developed rapidly as a statesman, and soon began to take steps to increase his personal authority as a ruler.

The first meeting of Philip of Hesse with Martin Luther took place in 1521, at the age of 17, at the Diet of Worms. There he was attracted by Luther&#x27;s personality, though he had at first little interest in the religious elements of the gathering. Philip embraced Protestantism in 1524 after a personal meeting with the theologian Philipp Melanchthon. He then helped suppress the German Peasants&#x27; War by defeating Thomas Müntzer at the Battle of Frankenhausen.

Philip refused to be drawn into the anti-Lutheran league of George, Duke of Saxony, in 1525. By his alliance with John, Elector of Saxony, concluded in Gotha on 27 February 1526, he showed that he was already taking steps to organize a protective alliance of all Protestant princes and powers. At the same time, he united political motives with his religious policy. As early as the spring of 1526, he sought to prevent the election of the Catholic Archduke Ferdinand as Holy Roman Emperor. At the Diet of Speyer in the same year, Philip openly championed the Protestant cause, rendering it possible for Protestant preachers to propagate their views while the Diet was in session, and, like his followers, openly disregarding ordinary Roman Catholic ecclesiastical usages.

===Introduction of the Reformation in Hesse===
Although there was no strong popular movement for Protestantism in Hesse, Philip determined to organize the church there according to Protestant principles. In this he was aided not only by his chancellor, the humanist Johann Feige, and his chaplain, Adam Krafft, but also by the ex-Franciscan François Lambert of Avignon, a staunch enemy of the faith he had left. While the radical policy of Lambert, embodied in the Homberg church order, was abandoned, at least in part, the monasteries and religious foundations were dissolved and their property was applied to charitable and scholastic purposes. The University of Marburg was founded in the summer of 1527 to be, like the University of Wittenberg, a school for Protestant theologians.

Philip&#x27;s father-in-law George, Duke of Saxony, the bishop of Würzburg, Konrad II von Thungen, and the archbishop of Mainz, Albert III of Brandenburg, were active in agitating against the growth of the Reformation. Their activities, along with other circumstances, including rumors of war, convinced Philip of the existence of a secret league among the Roman Catholic princes. His suspicions were confirmed to his own satisfaction by a forgery given him by an adventurer who had been employed in important missions by George of Saxony, one Otto von Pack. After meeting with Elector John of Saxony in Weimar on 9 March 1528, it was agreed that the Protestant princes should take the offensive in order to protect their territories from invasion and capture.

Both Luther and the elector&#x27;s chancellor, Gregor Brück, though convinced of the existence of the conspiracy, counseled strongly against acting on the offensive. The imperial authorities at Speyer now forbade all breach of the peace, and, after long negotiations, Philip succeeded in extorting the expenses for his armament from the dioceses of Würzburg, Bamberg, and Mainz, the latter bishopric also being compelled to recognize the validity of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Hessian and Saxon territory until the Holy Roman Emperor or a Christian council should decide to the contrary.

Political conditions were nonetheless very unfavorable to Philip, who might easily be charged with disturbing the peace of the empire, and at the Second Diet of Speyer, in the spring of 1529, he was publicly ignored by Emperor Charles V. Nevertheless, he took an active part in uniting the Protestant representatives, as well as in preparing the celebrated Protestation at Speyer. Before leaving the city he succeeded in forming, on 22 April 1529, a secret understanding between Saxony, Hesse, Nuremberg, Strasburg, and Ulm.

===Suspected of Zwinglianism===
Philip was especially anxious to prevent division over the subject of the Eucharist. Through him Huldrych Zwingli was invited to Germany, and Philip thus prepared the way for the celebrated Marburg Colloquy. Although the attitude of the Wittenberg theologians frustrated his attempts to bring about harmonious relations, and although the situation was further complicated by the position of Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, who demanded a uniform confession and a uniform church order, Philip held that the differences between the followers of Martin Bucer and the followers of Luther in their sacramental theories admitted honest disagreement, and that Holy Scripture could not resolve the differences definitively.

The result was that Philip was suspected of a tendency toward Zwinglianism. His sympathy for the Reformers associated with Zwingli in Switzerland and Bucer in Strasburg was intensified by the anger of the emperor at receiving from Philip a statement of Protestant tenets composed by the ex-Franciscan Lambert, and the landgrave&#x27;s failure to secure any common action on the part of the Protestant powers regarding the approaching Turkish war. Philip eagerly embraced Zwingli&#x27;s plan of a great Protestant alliance to extend from the Adriatic to Denmark to keep the Holy Roman Emperor from crossing into Germany. This association caused some coldness between himself and the followers of Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, especially when he propounded his irenic policy to Melanchthon and urged that all Protestants should stand together in demanding that a general council alone should decide religious differences. This was supposed to be indicative of Zwinglianism, and Philip soon found it necessary to explain his exact position on the question of the Eucharist, whereupon he declared that he fully agreed with the Lutherans, but disapproved of persecuting the Swiss.

The arrival of the emperor put an end to these disputes for the time being. But when Charles V demanded that the Protestant representatives should take part in the procession of Corpus Christi, and that Protestant preaching should cease in the city, Philip bluntly refused to obey. He now sought in vain to secure a modification of the tenth article of the Augsburg Confession, but when the position of the Upper Germans was officially rejected, Philip left the Diet directing his representatives manfully to uphold the Protestant position, and to keep general, not particular, interests constantly in view. At this time he offered Luther a refuge in his own territories and began to cultivate close relations with Martin Bucer, whose understanding of political questions created a common bond of sympathy between them. Moreover, Bucer fully agreed with the landgrave on the importance of compromise measures in treating the controversy surrounding the Eucharist.

===Leader of the Schmalkaldic League===
The German prince&#x27;s Evangelical interpretation of “cuius regio, eius religio” (&quot;Whose realm, his religion&quot; ) at the Diet of Speyer in 1526, gave the Landgrave authority to garner enough political support to start a war effort, or at least a defensive effort. This effort resulted in the foundation of: the League of Gotha, then the League of Torgau, and finally the Schmalkaldic League. The Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s elector John of Saxony, Philip&#x27;s most powerful ally, agreed to, “oppose the terms of the Edict of Worms, which outlawed Martin Luther and demanded his punishment as a heretic”. The Schmalkaldic League assumed the role of protectors of Protestant lands, the members of which were formally recognized in the First Agreement of the Schmalkaldic League in 1531.

In 1531 Philip was successful in accomplishing the purpose for which he had so long worked by securing the adhesion of the Protestant powers to the Schmalkaldic League, which was to protect their religious and secular interests against interference from the Emperor. The landgrave and his ally, John, Elector of Saxony, became recognized leaders of this union of German princes and cities. Philip was thoroughly convinced that the Protestant cause depended on weakening the power of the Habsburg emperors both at home and abroad.

Before engaging in hostilities, Philip attempted to achieve the goals of Protestant policy by peaceful means. He proposed a compromise on the subject of confiscated church property, but at the same time he was untiring in preparing for a possible recourse to war and cultivated diplomatic relations with any and all powers whom he knew to have anti-Habsburg interests. A peaceful turn came when arrangements were made with the Emperor at Nuremberg on 25 July 1532, but this did not prevent Philip from preparing for a future struggle.

Philip was untiring in his attempts to draw new allies into the league against Charles V and the Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria, who had been invested with the Duchy of Württemberg. The Battle of Lauffen on 13 May 1534 cost Ferdinand his newly acquired possession and caused Philip to be recognized as the hero of the day in Protestant Germany; his victory was viewed as the victory of the Schmalkaldic League. The war to capture Wuerttemberg cost Philip upwards of half a million florins, which turned out to be the most costly of his campaigns. After consulting a host of possible investors in Philip&#x27;s War, Philip raised: 
“21,000 fl. from Conrad Joham, February, 1543 -- 10,000 fl. From the civic regime April, 1534 – 10,000 fl. From the civic regime, June 24, 1534 – 5,000 fl. From the Great Hospital” 
The sum proved not to be enough to hold off the multi-ethnic Imperial hordes, backed by Genoese banks, Papal reserves, and subsidies collected from the Low Countries. 
In the years following, this coalition became one of the most important factors in European politics, largely through the influence of Philip, who lost no opportunity in furthering the Protestant cause. Its alliance was sought by both France and England; it was extended for a period of ten years with &quot;The Constitution of the Smalkaldic League, December 23, 1535&quot;; and new members were added to it for the cause; &quot;To begin with and first of all, this constitution shall have no other purpose, form, or intent than to provide defense and repulsion [of attack] and to keep ourselves and our subjects and related persons free of unjust violence. By this, we mean cases where, on account of the Christian, just, and correct cause – as defined in our treaty of Christian alliance – we are attacked, invaded, conquered, or in any other way injured, but only for this cause and no other.&quot;

On the other hand, the struggle between Protestant factions injured the advancement of their mutual interests, and Bucer, encouraged by Philip, was accordingly occupied in the attempt to bring Protestants together on a common religious platform, the result being the Wittenberg Concord. The emperor&#x27;s fears as to the political purpose of the league were, for the time being, set aside, but at the same time a council which would include representatives of the pope was rejected and measures were taken to secure the permanence of the Protestant cause in the future. In 1538–39 relations between Roman Catholics and Protestants became strained almost to the breaking-point, and war was averted only by the Frankfort Respite. The Protestants, however, failed to avail themselves of their opportunities, largely through the extreme docility and pliability of Philip.

===Bigamous marriage===

Within a few weeks of his 1523 marriage to the unattractive and sickly Christine of Saxony, who was also alleged to be an immoderate drinker, Philip committed adultery; and as early as 1526 he began to consider the permissibility of bigamy. According to Martin Luther, he lived &quot;constantly in a state of adultery and fornication.&quot;

Philip accordingly wrote Luther for his opinion about the matter, alleging as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs, but Luther replied that it was not enough for a Christian to consider the acts of the patriarchs, rather that he, like the patriarchs, must have special divine sanction. Since such sanction was clearly lacking in this case, Luther advised against bigamous marriage, especially for Christians, unless there was extreme necessity, as, for example, if the wife was leprous, or abnormal in other respects. Despite this discouragement, Philip gave up neither his project to secure a bigamous marriage nor his life of sensuality, which kept him for years from receiving communion.
Philip was affected by Melanchthon&#x27;s opinion concerning the case of Henry VIII, where the Reformer had proposed that the king&#x27;s difficulty could be solved by his taking a second wife better than by his divorcing the first one. To strengthen his position, there were Luther&#x27;s own statements in his sermons on the Book of Genesis, as well as historical precedents which proved to his satisfaction that it was impossible for anything to be un-Christian that God had not punished in the case of the patriarchs, who in the New Testament were held up as models of faith. It was during an illness due to his excesses that the thought of taking a second wife became a fixed purpose. 

It seemed to him to be the only salve for his troubled conscience and the only hope of moral improvement open to him. He accordingly proposed to marry the daughter of one of his sister&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, Margarethe von der Saale. While the landgrave had no scruples in this matter whatsoever, Margarethe was unwilling to take the step unless they had the approval of the theologians and the consent of the elector of Saxony, John Frederick I, and of Duke Maurice of Saxony. Philip easily gained his first wife&#x27;s consent to the marriage. Bucer, who was strongly influenced by political arguments, was won over by the landgrave&#x27;s threat to ally himself with the Emperor if he did not secure the consent of the theologians to the marriage, and the Wittenberg divines were worked upon by the plea of the prince&#x27;s ethical necessity.

Thus the &quot;secret advice of a confessor&quot; was won from Luther and Melanchthon (on 10 December 1539), neither of them knowing that the bigamous wife had already been chosen. Bucer and Melanchthon were now summoned, without any reason given, to appear in Rotenburg an der Fulda, where, on 4 March 1540, Philip and Margarethe were united. The time was particularly inauspicious for any scandal affecting the Protestants, for the Emperor, who had rejected the Frankfort Respite, was about to invade Germany. A few weeks later, however, the whole matter was revealed by Philip&#x27;s sister Elisabeth, and the scandal caused a painful reaction throughout Germany. Some of Philip&#x27;s allies refused to serve under him, and Luther, under the plea that it was a matter of advice given in the confessional, refused to acknowledge his part in the marriage.

===Overtures to the Emperor===
This event had affected the entire political situation in Germany. Even while the marriage question was occupying his attention, Philip was engaged in constructing far-reaching plans for implementing the new religion and for drawing together all the opponents of the House of Habsburg, though at the same time he did not give up hopes of reaching a religious compromise through diplomatic means. He was bitter regarding the criticism directed against him, and feared that the law which he himself had enacted against adultery might be applied to his own case. In this state of mind he was now determined to make his peace with the Emperor on terms which would not involve desertion of the Protestant cause. He offered to observe neutrality regarding the imperial acquisition of the Duchy of Cleves and to prevent a French alliance, on condition that the emperor would pardon him for all his opposition and violation of the imperial laws, though without direct mention of his bigamy.

The advances of Philip, though he declined to do anything prejudicial to the Protestant cause, were welcomed by the Emperor. Following Bucer&#x27;s advice, the landgrave now proceeded to take active steps with the hope of establishing religious peace between the Roman Catholics and Protestants. Secure of the imperial favor, he agreed to appear at the Diet of Regensburg in 1541, and his presence there contributed to the direction affairs took at the Regensburg religious colloquy, in which Melanchthon, Bucer, and Johann Pistorius the Elder represented the Protestant side. Philip was successful in securing the permission of the Emperor to establish a university at Marburg, and in return for the concession of an amnesty, he agreed to stand by Charles against all his enemies, excepting Protestantism and the Schmalkaldic League; to make no alliances with France, England, or the duke of Cleves; and to prevent the admission of these powers into the Schmalkaldic League.

For his part, the Emperor agreed not to attack him in case there was a common war against all Protestants. These arrangements for special terms led to the collapse of Philip&#x27;s position as leader of the Protestant party. He had become an object of suspicion, and, although the league continued to remain in force, and gained some new adherents in succeeding years, its real power had dissipated. But while only Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg, and Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, of the secular princes were still faithful to the Roman Catholic cause, and while united action might at the time easily have resulted in the triumph of Protestantism, there was no union of purpose. Duke Maurice of Saxony and Joachim II of Brandenburg would not join the Schmalkaldic League; Cleves was successfully invaded by imperial troops; and Protestantism was rigorously suppressed in Metz.

In 1543 the internal dissensions of the Protestant league compelled Philip to resign from its leadership and to think seriously of dissolving it. He put his trust entirely in the Emperor&#x27;s good faith, agreeing to help him against both the French and the Turks. At the Diet of Speyer in 1544 he championed the Emperor&#x27;s policy with eloquence. The bishop of Augsburg declared he must be inspired by the Holy Spirit, and Emperor Charles V now intended to make him commander-in-chief in the next war against the Turks.

===Resumption of hostility to Charles===

The situation was suddenly changed, however, and Philip was tardily forced again into the opposition against the Emperor, by the Treaty of Crépy of 1544, which opened his eyes to the danger threatening Protestantism. He prevented the Roman Catholic Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Lüneburg from taking forcible possession of his dominions and unsuccessfully planned a new alliance with German princes against Austria, pledging its members to prevent the acceptance of the decrees of the projected Council of Trent. When this failed, he sought to secure the neutrality of Bavaria in a possible war against the Protestants and proposed a new Protestant alliance to take the place of the Schmalkaldic League.

But all of this, like his projected coalition with the Swiss, was prevented from succeeding by the jealousy prevailing between Duke Maurice of Saxony and the Elector John Frederick I of Saxony. Fearful of the success of these plans, the emperor invited Philip to an interview at Speyer. Philip spoke plainly in criticism of the Emperor&#x27;s policy, and it was soon evident that peace could not be preserved. Four months later (20 July 1546) the imperial ban was declared against John Frederick and Philip as perjured rebels and traitors. The result was the Schmalkaldic War, the outcome of which was unfavorable to Protestant interests. The defeat at the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547 and the capture of the Elector John Frederick marked the fall of the Schmalkaldic League.

In despair Philip, who had been negotiating with the Emperor for some time, agreed to throw himself on his mercy, on condition that his territorial rights would not be impaired and that he himself would not be imprisoned. These terms were disregarded, however, and on 23 June 1547 both the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League were taken to south Germany and held as captives.

===Imprisonment of Philip and Interim in Hesse===

The imprisonment of Philip put the Protestants in Hesse into great trials and difficulties. It had previously been organized carefully by Philip and Bucer, and synods, presbyteries, and a system of discipline had been established. Now the public worship showed no uniformity, discipline was not applied, and many competing sectaries existed. The Augsburg Interim was finally introduced, sanctioning Catholic practises and terms.

Philip himself wrote from prison to forward the acceptance of the Augsburg Interim, especially as his liberty depended upon it. As long as the unrestricted preaching of the Gospel and the Protestant tenet of justification by faith were secured, other matters seemed to him of subordinate importance. He read Roman Catholic controversial literature, attended mass, and was much impressed by his study of the Fathers of the Church. The Hessian clergy, however, boldly opposed the introduction of the Interim and the government at Kassel refused to obey the landgrave&#x27;s commands. Meanwhile, his imprisonment was made still more bitter by the information which he received concerning conditions in Hesse, and the rigor of his confinement was increased after he had made an unsuccessful attempt to escape. It was not until 1552 that the Peace of Passau gave him his long-desired freedom and that he was able, on 12 September 1552, to reenter his capital, Kassel.

===Closing years===
Though Philip was now active in restoring order within his territories, new leaders—such as Maurice of Saxony and Christopher of Württemberg—had come to the fore. Philip no longer desired to assume the leadership of the Protestant party. All his energies were now directed toward finding a basis of agreement between Protestants and Roman Catholics. At his direction his theologians were prominent in the various conferences where representative Roman Catholics and Protestants assembled to attempt to find a working basis for reunion.

Philip was also much disturbed by the internal conflicts that arose after Luther&#x27;s death between his followers and the disciples of Melanchthon. He never wearied in urging the necessity of mutual toleration between Calvinists and Lutherans, and to the last cherished the hope of a great Protestant federation, so that, with this end in view, he cultivated friendly relations with French Protestants and with Elizabeth I of England.

Financial aid was given to the Huguenots, and Hessian troops fought side by side with them in the French religious civil wars, this policy contributing to the declaration of toleration at Amboise in March 1563. He gave permanent form to the Hessian Church by the great agenda of 1566–67, and in his will, dated 1562, urged his sons to maintain the Augsburg Confession and the Concord of Wittenberg, and at the same time to work in behalf of a reunion of Roman Catholics and Protestants if opportunity and circumstances should permit.

Philip died in 1567 and was interred in Kassel.

==Marriages and children==
Philip married in Dresden on 11 December 1523 Christine of Saxony (daughter of George, Duke of Saxony) and had in this marriage 10 children:

<text>A Bowie knife ( ) is a pattern of fixed-blade fighting knives created by Rezin Bowie in the early 19th century for his brother James Bowie, who had become famous for his use of a large knife at a duel known as the Sandbar Fight.

Since the first incarnation, the Bowie knife has come to incorporate several recognizable and characteristic design features, although in common usage the term refers to any large sheath knife with a crossguard and a clip point. The knife pattern is still popular with collectors; in addition to various knife manufacturing companies, there are hundreds of custom knifemakers producing Bowie knives with different types of steel and variations in style.
==Historical complications==
The early history of the Bowie knife is complicated by murky definitions, limited supporting documentation, and conflicting claims. The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most included some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades. Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.

The Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from James Bowie, a notorious knife fighter, who died at the Battle of the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie fought only one personal knife fight (and, if Rezin Bowie&#x27;s account is true, that fight was not fought with a blade meeting the modern definition). That Sandbar Fight received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the &quot;Niles&#x27; Register&quot; of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.

The Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother Rezin Bowie provided a terse history two years after James&#x27; death. Sixteen years after James&#x27; death someone (assumed to be James&#x27; brother John) slightly amended Rezin&#x27;s explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin&#x27;s grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.

In the mid-20th century, a Bowie knife book author took liberties with the historical facts. Some documents were misquoted, some reported facts cannot be confirmed, etc. Others incorporated the errors into their accounts of both Bowie and his knives.

With no solid definition and conflicting accounts of knife history, many were credited with the invention or improvement of the blade.

==Origin and description==
The historical Bowie knife was not a single design but was a series of knives improved several times by Jim Bowie over the years. The earliest such knife, made by Jesse Clift at Bowie&#x27;s brother Rezin&#x27;s request, resembled Spanish hunting knives of the day, and differed little from a common butcher knife. The blade, as later described by Rezin Bowie, was long, thick and wide. It was straight-backed, described by witnesses as &quot;a large butcher knife&quot;, and having no clip-point nor any handguard, with a simple riveted wood scale handle.

Bernard Levine has reported that the first known Bowie knife showed a strong Mediterranean influence insofar as general lines were concerned, particularly the shape of the traditional Spanish folding knife (navaja), then often carried by immigrants to Mexico and other territories of the Old Southwest. In an 1828 account of the capture of a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish and South American pirates, the carrying of knives similar to the early Bowie knife is mentioned:

After the Vidalia Sandbar fight, Bowie was a famous man, and the Bowie brothers received many requests for knives of the same design. Bowie and his brothers later commissioned more ornate custom blades from various knife makers including Daniel Searles and John Constable. George William Featherstonhaugh described them as, &quot;These formidable instruments ... are the pride of an Arkansas blood, and got their name of Bowie knives from a conspicuous person of this fiery climate.&quot;

According to an 1847 article, the Bowie knife was originally designed to fill the need for a wearable, convenient, close-combat weapon – a short sword much shorter than the saber or other swords of the day, yet still possessing a heavy blade. This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics. By this time the &#x27;Bowie knife&#x27; was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to &quot;that of a carving knife&quot;. The blade design was described as:


Most later versions of the Bowie knife had a blade of at least in length, some reaching or more, with a relatively broad blade that was wide and made of steel usually between thick. The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally brass or copper) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent&#x27;s blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat-treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.) Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an S-guard) intended to catch an opponent&#x27;s blade or provide protection to the owner&#x27;s hand during parries and corps-a-corps.

Some Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the hilt known as a &quot;Spanish Notch&quot;. The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent&#x27;s blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping sinew and repairing rope and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.

One characteristic of Bowie knives is the clip point at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a false edge as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of saber fencing to execute the maneuver called the &quot;back cut&quot; or &quot;back slash&quot;. A brass quillon, usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.

The Bowie knife&#x27;s design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a carcass, while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the James Black knife in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: &quot;It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.&quot; Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and skinning the carcass.

== History ==
=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===

The first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie&#x27;s brother Rezin in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file. Period court documents indicate that Rezin Bowie and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin&#x27;s granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to Louisiana State University that her mother (Rezin&#x27;s daughter) personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her father.

This knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the Sandbar Fight, a famous 1827 duel between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of Alexandria, Louisiana. The fight took place on a sandbar in the Mississippi River across from Natchez, Mississippi, and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle, Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.

Jim Bowie&#x27;s older brother John later claimed that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft&#x27;s knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.

=== James Black&#x27;s Bowie knife ===
The most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to Arkansas blacksmith James Black in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830. Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie&#x27;s original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade. Black offered Bowie his choice and Bowie chose the modified version. Knives such as this, with a blade shaped like that of the Bowie knife, but with a pronounced false edge, are today called &quot;Sheffield Bowie&quot; knives, because this blade shape became so popular that cutlery factories in Sheffield, England were mass-producing such knives for export to the U.S. by 1850, usually with a handle made from either hardwood, deer antler, or bone, and sometimes with a guard and other fittings of sterling silver. The James Black Bowie knife had a blade approximately long, wide, and thick. The spine of the knife was covered with soft brass or silver, reportedly to catch the opponent&#x27;s blade in the course of a knife fight, while a brass quillion protected the hand from the blade.

In 1831 Bowie returned with his James Black Bowie knife to Texas, and was involved in a knife fight with three men armed with firearms, who had been hired to kill him by the man he had spared in his 1829 fight. According to reports of the time, Bowie used his knife to kill all three men: one assassin was nearly decapitated, the second was disemboweled, and the skull of the third man was split open. Bowie died at the Battle of the Alamo five years later and in death both he and his knife became an American legend. The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving &quot;Bowie No. 1&quot; has been acquired by the Historic Arkansas Museum from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis.

Black soon had a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in Washington, Arkansas. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.

Black&#x27;s knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true Damascus steel.

In 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, Daniel Webster Jones. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.

The claims regarding James Black and his knives have been challenged by historians and knife experts. Little can be either proven or disproven; Black was found mentally incompetent before his claims were published.

The birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the Old Washington Historic State Park which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black&#x27;s shop. The park is known as &quot;The Colonial Williamsburg of Arkansas&quot;. The University of Arkansas Hope - Texarkana opened their James Black School of Bladesmithing and Historic Trades in historic Washington in January 2020.

===Later history===


The term &quot;Bowie knife&quot; appeared in advertising (multiple places) by 1835, about 8 years after the sandbar brawl, while James Bowie was still alive. From context, &quot;Bowie knife&quot; needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.

The Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the Old Southwest of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.

Bowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the civil strife in Kansas, the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians. John Brown (abolitionist) carried a Bowie (which was taken by J. E. B. Stuart). (p 117) John Wilkes Booth (assassin of Abraham Lincoln) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158) &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody &quot;reportedly&quot; scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the Battle of Warbonnet Creek). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171) Brigham Young, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), used to carry a Bowie knife with him, and dreamed about killing ex-Mormon apostates with it; for this reason, it has a significance to the DezNat (alt-right LDS) community online, who link it to the concept of blood atonement in Mormonism.

Historically, in the US, the heyday of the large Bowie knife was when cap and ball black powder arms were not exceptionally reliable and the single shot ones slow to load hence the need for a large knife such as what we call a Bowie as a weapon and for use as a camp knife. When reliable cartridge repeating firearms came along the size blade length and width was reduced because there was a less likely need for them as a weapon. With the advent of affordably priced, reliable revolvers in the US (including surplus ex-Civil war handguns), the popularity of the Bowie knife declined sharply after 1865. While still quite popular, newer Bowie designs began to incorporate much shorter blades of seven or eight inches, a length more suited to butchering and skinning game animals. By the turn of the century, the most mass-produced Bowies were being sold as all-purpose outdoor hunting/camping knives. Despite this, the Bowie still retained its ability to serve as a close-in fighting knife. The USMC Ka-Bar of World War II fame is based on a Bowie design dating back to the classic Marbles Ideal camping/hunting knife first introduced in 1899. 

Since the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the United States Air Force survival knife which is used by several branches of the US Armed Forces. Each knife is manufactured in accordance with US Government specifications. It features a 5&quot; 1095 carbon steel clip point sawback blade with a swedge, false top edge and fullers. The handle is made from natural leather with a stainless steel butt cap. The included natural leather sheath comes with a whetstone and leg tie. The sawteeth were intended to cut through the plexiglass canopy of a downed aircraft. Shortly after similar knives with a metal hollow handle appeared allowing small survival items to be stored inside the handle. Bowies are still popular to this day as evidenced by the plethora of factory-made and custom-made bowie-style knives available to sportsmen and collectors.

== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==
Jim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the &quot;Blade&quot; magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition of the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.

Custom knife maker Ernest Emerson originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.

A Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas.

===The Alfred Williams Bowie knife===
From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, the Alfred Williams EBRO Bowie knife became a big seller in the US. The EBRO trademark was purchased by Adolph Kastor &amp; Sons of New York from Joseph Wostenholm &amp; Sons in Sheffield. Alfred Williams specialized in selling knives to the US market, and as such, his knives destined for the US market bore the EBRO importer stamp on them along with Alfred Williams&#x27; name. Original Alfred Williams Bowie knives now sell for substantial amounts in auction. One unique Alfred Williams Bowie knife with a carved handle that belonged to a Texan family sold for $60,000 in auction.

===Variations===
Among the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost in length and weighing was made for presentation to an American congressman who &quot;offered&quot; to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between Roger Atkinson Pryor and John F. Potter). A few huge Bowies up to long were created for exhibition.

Over the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the American Civil War, Confederate soldiers carried immense knives called D-Guard Bowie knives. Many of these knives could have qualified as short swords and were often made from old saw or scythe blades.

The Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the &quot;Arkansas toothpick&quot;, possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names &quot;Arkansas toothpick&quot;, &quot;Bowie knife&quot;, and &quot;Arkansas knife&quot; in the antebellum period. The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy dagger with a straight blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the &quot;Arkansas toothpick&quot;, no firm evidence exists for this claim.

Knives made in Sheffield, England, were quick to enter the market with &quot;Bowie knives&quot; of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge. While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England. Sheffield Bowies were sold with a wide range of etched or stamped slogans designed to appeal to Americans: &quot;Death to Abolition&quot;, &quot;Death to Traitors&quot;, &quot;Americans Never Surrender&quot;, &quot;Alabama Hunting Knife&quot;, &quot;Arkansas Toothpick&quot;, &quot;Gold Seeker&#x27;s Protection&quot;... American victories and generals were commemorated. &quot;Bowie Knife&quot; is etched on many different designs (including folding knives) of the era. The British disguised the origin of their products, operating the &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, and &quot;Columbia Works&quot; in Sheffield. They stamped &quot;US&quot;, &quot;NY&quot;, etc. on their blades. The Sheffield &quot;factories&quot; were warehouses that collected the work of area craftsmen. The smelters, forgers, grinders, silversmiths, carvers, etchers ... were individuals or small businesses.

===Collecting===
During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Bowie knife served usefully as a camp and hunting tool, as well as a weapon, and is still popular with some hunters and trappers in the present day. However, as today&#x27;s campers and backpackers generally rely on prepared lightweight foods, and have little or no use for a large knife as a weapon or for butchering wild game animals, the traditional Bowie pattern knife is today mostly purchased by collectors or edged weapon enthusiasts.

The Bowie remains popular with collectors. In addition to various knife manufacturing companies there are hundreds of custom knife makers and bladesmiths producing Bowies and variations. The Bowie knife dominates the work produced by members of the American Bladesmith Society. Collecting antique Bowie knives is one of the higher-end forms of knife collecting with rare models selling as high as $200,000. Even mass-produced Sheffield Bowies from the 19th century can sell in the range of $5,000US to $15,000US.

===Portrayal in popular culture===
The Bowie knife has been present in popular culture throughout the ages, ranging from the days of the Western dime novels and pulps to Literary Fiction such as the 1897 classic vampire novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Count Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of the story, Dracula is actually killed by his heart being pierced by Quincey Morris&#x27;s Bowie knife and his throat being sliced by Jonathan Harker&#x27;s kukri knife. Bowie knives appeared in the classic works of Americans Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain, Englishman Charles Dickens, and Frenchman Jules Verne.

The Bowie knife was a staple in &quot;The Alamo&quot; movies of 1960 and 2004; the first three Rambo movies, &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1985), and &quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988); the film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986) and its sequel &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; (1988); and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980). The Bowie knife is also Ghostface&#x27;s signature weapon in the Scream franchise (1996). 

The famous singer and musician David Bowie (born David Robert Jones) took the name Bowie after the Bowie knife because, in his words, &quot;it cuts both ways&quot;.

In the first-person shooter video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the Sniper character has an unlockable weapon named the Bushwacka, which is styled after a Bowie knife.

==Historical and modern legal status==

Because of its widespread use and deadly effect when used in hand-to-hand fighting, it has been argued by some historians that the Bowie knife was seen by upper-class Americans as the 19th-century equivalent of today&#x27;s mass-produced handgun or &#x27;Saturday night special&#x27;, particularly in the states of the Old Southwest. In 1837, just one year after Bowie&#x27;s death at the Alamo, Alabama legislators passed laws imposing a $100 transfer tax on &#x27;Bowie&#x27; knives and decreeing that anyone carrying a Bowie knife who subsequently killed a person in a fight would be charged with premeditated murder. Louisiana and Virginia prohibited the concealed carrying of any Bowie knife, while Mississippi made such knives illegal when carried concealed or when used as a dueling weapon. In Tennessee, the use of Bowie knives to settle disputes on the spot so alarmed the wealthy classes composing the state legislature that in 1838 they not only made the concealed carrying of a Bowie knife a criminal felony, but also prohibited the use of a Bowie knife in any altercation, regardless of self-defense or other mitigating excuse:

That if any person carrying any knife or weapon known as a Bowie knife ... or any knife or weapon that shall in form, shape, or size resemble a Bowie knife, on a sudden encounter, shall cut or stab another person with such knife or weapon, whether death ensues or not, such person so stabbing or cutting shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be confined in the jail and penitentiary house of this State, for a period of time not less than three years, nor more than fifteen years. Even Texas passed legislation in 1871 prohibiting the carrying of a Bowie knife &quot;on or about one&#x27;s person&quot; in public places, a law which remained in place until 2017.

Although many jurisdictions worldwide have knife legislation regulating the length of a blade one may own or carry, certain locales in the United States have legislation restricting or prohibiting the carrying of a &quot;Bowie knife&quot;. Most of these laws were characterized at the time as &#x27;anti-dueling&#x27; laws. However, in this context, the term &quot;dueling&quot; had degenerated from its original 18th century definition (a rarely used social custom among the wealthy classes) into a generalized description for &quot;any&quot; knife or gun fight between two contestants. In some states, many of these laws are still in force today whereas, in other states, these laws were repealed or amended.

In 2017, the old Texas law prohibiting the carrying of a Bowie knife in public was finally updated to allow such carry in most circumstances, with exceptions for knives of a certain blade length which cannot be carried in schools, polling places, places of worship, amusement parks, courthouses, racetracks, correctional facilities, hospitals and nursing facilities, sporting events, and certain establishments selling alcohol. The Texas Legislature designated the Bowie knife as the official state knife of Texas in 2021.

It is argued that the terms &quot;Bowie Knife&quot; and &quot;Arkansas Toothpick&quot; are too subjective to form the basis of sound legislation.

<text>Walter Marty Schirra Jr. ( ; March 12, 1923 – May 3, 2007) was an American naval aviator, test pilot, and NASA astronaut. In 1959, he became one of the original seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury, which was the United States&#x27; first effort to put humans into space. On October 3, 1962, he flew the six-orbit, nine-hour, Mercury-Atlas 8 mission, in a spacecraft he nicknamed &quot;Sigma 7&quot;, becoming the fifth American and ninth human to travel into space. In December 1965, as part of the two-man Gemini program, he achieved the first space rendezvous, station-keeping his Gemini 6A spacecraft within of the sister Gemini 7 spacecraft. In October 1968, he commanded Apollo 7, an 11-day low Earth orbit shakedown test of the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module and the first crewed launch for the Apollo program.

Before becoming an astronaut, Schirra graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1945, and served at sea during World War II. In 1948, he became a naval aviator, served as a fighter pilot and flew 90 combat missions in the Korean War, and then in 1958 he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Schirra retired from the Navy in 1969 with the rank of captain.

Schirra was the first astronaut to go into space three times, and the only astronaut to have flown into space in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. In total, he logged 295 hours and 15 minutes in space. After Apollo 7, he retired as a captain from the U.S. Navy as well as from NASA, subsequently becoming a consultant to CBS News in the network&#x27;s coverage of following Apollo flights. Schirra joined Walter Cronkite as co-anchor for all seven of NASA&#x27;s Moon landing missions.

== Early life and education ==
Schirra was born on March 12, 1923, in Hackensack, New Jersey, to a family of aviators. His paternal grandparents were Swiss of Italian heritage (from Sardinia); his grandfather Adam Schirra was born in the Italian-speaking village of Loco in Ticino, Switzerland, and emigrated with his wife Josephina (Marty) Schirra to the United States from Bavaria. Schirra&#x27;s father, Walter M. Schirra Sr. (1893–1973), who was born in Philadelphia, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War I, and flew bombing and reconnaissance missions over Germany. After the war, he performed as a barnstormer at county fairs in New Jersey, as did Schirra&#x27;s mother, Florence Shillito Schirra (; 1898–1982), who performed wing walking stunts.

Schirra Jr. grew up in Oradell, New Jersey, where he attended elementary school and was a First Class Scout in Boy Scout Troop 36. He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, New Jersey, in June 1940 and enrolled in the Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJIT), where he was involved in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and the Sigma Pi fraternity. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Schirra decided to apply to a service academy. His father encouraged him to apply to West Point, but he decided to enroll in the United States Naval Academy instead. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1945 after only three years instead of four, as the Naval Academy had a wartime accelerated curriculum.

== Military service ==
After graduating from the Naval Academy, Schirra was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy on June 6, 1945. He served during the final months of World War II aboard the large cruiser . Following the Japanese surrender, he returned to the U.S., where the &quot;Alaska&quot; was decommissioned. He was subsequently stationed to Qingdao and assigned to the amphibious command ship . Following his return from China, he began training as a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

After he completed training, Schirra received his naval aviator wings in 1948 and joined Fighter Squadron 71 (VF-71) at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. In VF-71, Schirra flew the F8F Bearcat. After several years of flying the F8F, he attended jet transition training with the F-80 Shooting Star in preparation for his squadron&#x27;s transition to the jet-powered F9F Panther. Schirra was deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the aircraft carrier at the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950. He applied for an exchange program with the U.S. Air Force to gain combat experience, was selected for the program, and trained to fly on the F-84 Thunderjet.

Schirra was initially deployed with the 154th Fighter-Bomber Squadron to Itazuke Air Force Base in Japan, from where he flew missions into South Korea. As U.S. troops advanced north, the squadron was reassigned to a base in Daegu. In the eight-month deployment, Schirra flew 90 combat missions and downed two MiG-15s.

After completing his tour in Korea, Schirra became a test pilot at Naval Ordnance Test Station China Lake, California (NOTS). At China Lake, he tested various weapons systems, including becoming the first pilot to fly with and fire the Sidewinder missile. He was assigned to Miramar Naval Air Station to test the newest Navy jet fighter, the F7U Cutlass. He was subsequently assigned to NAS Moffett to begin transition training to the Cutlass, and subsequently the F3H Demon. After a deployment to Asia aboard the aircraft carrier and aviation safety training with the University of Southern California (USC), he was accepted to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1958.

Schirra was a member of Class 20 at the Naval Test Pilot School, along with future fellow astronauts Jim Lovell and Pete Conrad, where he learned to fly numerous aircraft, including the F4D Skyray, the F11F Tiger, and the F8U Crusader. After graduation, Schirra became a test pilot at Naval Air Station Patuxent River and learned to fly the F4H Phantom to determine if it could become a carrier-based aircraft.

== NASA career ==

=== Project Mercury ===

In February 1959, Schirra was one of 110 military test pilots selected by their commanding officers as candidates for the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s Project Mercury, the first U.S. crewed space flight program. Following several rounds of tests, Schirra became a member of the original seven astronauts selected for the program in April 1959. During the program&#x27;s development, Schirra&#x27;s areas of responsibility were the life-support systems and the pressurized flight suit. Additionally, Schirra worked alongside John Glenn in capsule design. Scott Carpenter and Schirra flew F-106 Delta Dart chase planes during Alan Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Freedom 7&quot; suborbital mission. Schirra was initially assigned as Deke Slayton&#x27;s backup for the second orbital Mercury flight but was replaced with Carpenter when Slayton was grounded. Schirra was instead scheduled for the third orbital flight.

At 7:15am on October 3, 1962, Schirra lifted off aboard his Mercury flight, named &quot;Sigma 7&quot;. After a minor trajectory deviation early in flight, &quot;Sigma 7&quot; achieved orbit. Once in orbit, Schirra demonstrated manually positioning and maneuvering his spacecraft using a reaction control system. After the navigation issues during Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Aurora 7&quot; mission, NASA and Schirra focused on the engineering and human factors in manually operating the capsule. Schirra reported rising suit temperatures, reaching a high of , before he was able to adjust his suit&#x27;s cooling system manually. After completing his spacecraft tests, Schirra tested his ability to use controls in a zero-gravity environment without sight. Throughout his mission, Schirra demonstrated the ability to act as a backup to automatic controls and manually fly the spacecraft. After six orbits, Schirra manually aligned his spacecraft over Africa and performed retrofire. &quot;Sigma 7&quot; landed from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier , in the central Pacific Ocean. Once &quot;Sigma 7&quot; was on deck, Schirra activated the explosive hatch to egress the spacecraft, and received a large bruise, proving that Grissom had not intentionally opened his hatch on &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;. After Schirra returned to the US, he and his family were invited to the Oval Office at the White House to meet President Kennedy on October 16.

=== Project Gemini ===
At the beginning of the Gemini program, Alan Shepard was assigned to command Gemini 3 with Tom Stafford as the pilot, but they were replaced by a backup crew after Shepard was diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease, a disorder of the inner ear. Schirra and Stafford became the backup crew for the new Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, and were subsequently scheduled for the Gemini 6 primary crew. Gemini 6 was originally scheduled to perform the first orbital docking with an Agena target vehicle. The Agena vehicle exploded during its launch into orbit on October 25, 1965, while Schirra and Stafford waited in their spacecraft to lift off. Program managers decided that rather than wait for a replacement Agena to be available, they would revise the mission, calling it Gemini 6A and having it attempt a rendezvous with Gemini 7, to be flown by Frank Borman and Jim Lovell. On December 4, 1965, Gemini 7 lifted off to begin its two-week mission. Gemini 6A prepared to launch on December 12, but its engines shut down less than two seconds after ignition. Despite protocols calling for the astronauts to eject from the spacecraft in the event of an engine shutdown, Schirra chose not to activate his and Stafford&#x27;s rocket-powered ejection seats, saving them both from probable injuries and a further delay and possible cancellation of the mission. Gemini 6A lifted off on December 15 and successfully rendezvoused with Gemini 7 after five hours of flight. The two spacecraft maneuvered to within one foot of each other and kept station for 5 hours. Following the rendezvous, Gemini 6A deorbited on December 16 and was recovered in the Atlantic ocean southeast of Cape Canaveral by the .

While on the Gemini mission, Schirra played a Christmas practical joke on the flight controllers by first reporting a mock UFO (implying Santa Claus) sighting, then playing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; on a four-hole Hohner harmonica he had smuggled on board, accompanied by Stafford on sleigh bells.

=== Apollo program ===

In mid-1966, Schirra was assigned to command a three-man Apollo crew with Donn F. Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham to make the second crewed flight test of the Apollo Command/Service Module, with a mission profile identical to Apollo 1. Schirra argued against a repeat mission, and his crew became the backup crew for Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. Schirra&#x27;s crew conducted tests in the command module on January 26, 1967, and were en route to Houston the next day when Grissom and his crew were killed in a fire during a test. Schirra&#x27;s crew became the prime crew of the first crewed flight. This became Apollo 7 in the program&#x27;s revised mission numbering plan, and was delayed until the fall of 1968 while safety improvements were made to the Command Module.

Schirra had gained a sense of security from having Guenter Wendt, a McDonnell Aircraft employee, as the pad leader responsible for the spacecraft&#x27;s launch readiness. As the Apollo contractor was now North American Aviation, Wendt was no longer pad leader. After the Apollo 1 accident, Schirra felt so strongly he wanted none other than Wendt as pad leader for his Apollo flight, that he convinced Deke Slayton and North American&#x27;s launch operations manager Bastian &quot;Buzz&quot; Hello to hire Wendt as Apollo 7 pad leader. Wendt remained pad leader for the remainder of the Apollo and Skylab programs, and stayed on with NASA into the Space Shuttle program before retiring. However, Schirra was prevented from naming his spacecraft &quot;Phoenix&quot; in honor of the Apollo 1 crew, because some believed that its nickname as a metaphor for &quot;fire&quot; might be misunderstood.

Apollo 7 was launched on October 11, 1968, making Schirra the first person to fly in space three times. Prior to launch, Schirra had objected because of high winds, which could have injured the astronauts in the event of an abort within the first minute of the mission. After reaching orbit, the Apollo 7 CSM performed space rendezvous and docking exercises with the S-4B stage to simulate retrieving the Apollo Lunar Module. On the second day of the mission, the crew conducted the first live television pictures publicly broadcast from inside a crewed spacecraft.

During the mission, Schirra became sick with a head cold, which he passed to Eisele. Anticipating issues with congestion inside of a sealed spacesuit, Schirra proposed to Mission Control that they would not wear their helmets during reentry. Despite a request from Chris Kraft and Deke Slayton to wear helmets during reentry, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham refused and performed reentry without them. Apollo 7 landed southeast of Bermuda on October 22, 1968.

Prior to the Apollo 7 launch, Schirra had decided to retire after the flight, and left the NASA Astronaut Corps on July 1, 1969. Schirra&#x27;s last assignment as an astronaut was to conduct the investigation into Neil Armstrong&#x27;s Lunar Landing Research Vehicle crash, which he attributed to a mechanical failure and recommended suspending training with the vehicle. On the same date, Schirra retired from the Navy with the rank of Captain.

== Post-NASA career ==

=== Television career ===
A combination of pseudoephedrine decongestant with triprolidine antihistamine was the cold medicine carried on board the Apollo missions and prescribed by the flight surgeon. Years later when this became available over the counter as Actifed, the makers of Actifed hired Schirra as a television commercial spokesman, based on the notoriety of his Apollo 7 in-space head cold.

During later Apollo missions, he served as a consultant to CBS News from 1969 to 1975. He joined Walter Cronkite to co-anchor the network&#x27;s coverage of the seven Moon landing missions, starting with Apollo 11 (joined by Arthur C. Clarke) and including the ill-fated Apollo 13.

=== Business career ===
Following his NASA career, Schirra became president and a director of the financial and leasing company Regency Investors Incorporated. He left Regency Investors to form Environmental Control Company and served as the company&#x27;s chairman and CEO from 1970 to 1973. The company merged with SERNCO Incorporated in 1973. Schirra started as vice-chairman, but was elected to chairman of the board later that year. He also worked to develop an Alaskan oil pipeline and was a member of an advisory board for U.S. National Parks in the Department of the Interior from 1973 to 1985.

In January 1979, Schirra founded Schirra Enterprises, and worked as a consultant until 1980. He worked for the Belgian Consulate for Colorado and New Mexico, from 1971 to 1984, and was a board member of several corporations including Electromedics, Finalco, Kimberly-Clark, Net Air International, Rocky Mountain Airlines, and Johns-Manville Corporation. Schirra was president of the energy development company Prometheus from 1980 to 1981. In 1984, he was among the surviving Mercury astronauts who established the Mercury Seven Foundation, now known as the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, to award college scholarships to science and engineering students.

=== Writing career ===
Schirra, along with the rest of the Mercury Seven, co-authored the 1962 book &quot;We Seven,&quot; detailing the training and development of the Mercury program. Along with Richard N. Billings, Schirra released his autobiography &quot;Schirra&#x27;s Space&quot; in 1988. In 1995, he co-authored the book &quot;Wildcats to Tomcats: The Tailhook Navy&quot; with Barrett Tillman and fellow Navy Captains Richard L. (Zeke) Cormier, and Phil Wood. It describes five decades of Naval aviation, including accounts of combat tours in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. In 2005, he co-authored the book &quot;The Real Space Cowboys&quot; with Ed Buckbee. The book is an account of the &#x27;Mercury Seven&#x27; astronauts. It follows them through the process of selection for the program, their entire careers, and into retirement. Schirra was also a contributor to the 2007 book, &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;, which was his final authored work.

== Personal life ==
Shortly after being commissioned in the Navy, Schirra began dating Josephine Cook &quot;Jo&quot; Fraser. Schirra and Fraser were married on February 23, 1946. They had two children, Walter M. (III) and Suzanne Karen, born in 1950 and 1957. Jo Schirra died April 27, 2015, at the age of 91.

== Death ==

Schirra died on May 3, 2007, of a heart attack while undergoing treatment for abdominal cancer at Scripps Green Hospital (currently The Heart Center at Scripps) in San Diego, California. He was 84 years old. A memorial service for Schirra was held on May 22 at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in California. The ceremony concluded with a three-volley salute and a flyover by three F/A-18s. Schirra was cremated and his ashes were committed to the sea on February 11, 2008. The burial at sea ceremony was held aboard the and his ashes were released by Commander Lee Axtell, the command chaplain aboard (see photo).

== Awards and honors ==

Schirra&#x27;s numerous military decorations include three Air Medals and three NASA Distinguished Service Medals, including one posthumously. His first NASA Distinguished Service Medal was for his Mercury flight, and the second for his Gemini 6A flight. He was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Navy Occupation Medal with &quot;ASIA&quot; clasp, the China Service Medal, and the Korean Service Medal. Additionally, he received several international awards, including a Korean Presidential Unit Citation, the United Nations Korea Medal, and the Korean War Service Medal. Schirra has also received civilian aviation awards, including the AIAA Award (1963), the Harmon Trophy (1965), the Kitty Hawk Award, and the Golden Key Award.

When Schirra received his Navy Astronaut Wings from Secretary Fred Korth, the Navy&#x27;s uniform guidance did not specify whether it should be worn alongside or instead of his naval aviator wings. Schirra decided to wear his astronaut wings above his ribbons, and the aviator wings below them. Schirra received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for commanding Apollo 7. He was also awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for escorting B-29 bombers during the Korean War, a gold star for his &quot;Sigma 7&quot; flight, and a second gold star for flying on Gemini 6A. Schirra, a fellow of Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), received its Iven C. Kincheloe Award in 1963 along with the other six Mercury astronauts. In 1962, he and the other Mercury astronauts received the Robert J. Collier Trophy, which was typically given to engineers and inventors.

Schirra was a 33rd Degree Mason and part of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, as well as a fellow of the American Astronautical Society. Schirra received Honorary Doctorates of Science from three colleges and universities: Lafayette College (for Astronautical Engineering), the University of Southern California, and his alma mater the Newark College of Engineering (for Astronautics). Schirra was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame (1970), the International Space Hall of Fame (1981), the National Aviation Hall of Fame (1986), the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (1990), and the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The , a named for Schirra, was christened and launched March 8, 2009. A street is named after Schirra in Upper Dublin, Pennsylvania, and a park in Oradell, New Jersey. There is a Walter M. Schirra Elementary School in Old Bridge Township, New Jersey.

<doc id="331467" wikidata="Q2124400" url="?curid=331467" title="RMS Empress of Russia">
<text>RMS &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was a steam turbine ocean liner built in 1912–13 by Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company at Govan on the Clyde in Scotland for Canadian Pacific steamships (CP). She regularly worked the trans-Pacific route between Canada and the Far East.

== History ==
Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company built the ship at Govan near Glasgow in Scotland. &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was launched on 28 August 1912 and completed in March 1913.

She left Liverpool on 1 April 1913 on her maiden voyage via Suez to Hong Kong and Vancouver. Thereafter, she regularly sailed back and forth along the Hong Kong – Shanghai – Nagasaki – Kobe – Yokohama – Vancouver route. In 1913 she broke the record for the fastest trans-Pacific crossing which was formerly held by ; but her sister ship, broke that record in May 1914, crossing the Pacific in nine days, two hours, and fifteen minutes. The popularity of the short route from Vancouver to the Orient was so great that these two additional CP Empress&#x27;ocean liners were necessary.

The vessel had a length of , and her beam was . She had three funnels and two masts. Her four steam turbines drove four screws, giving her a cruising speed of . The ocean liner provided accommodation for 284 first-class passengers and for 100 second class passengers. There was also room for up to 800 steerage-class passengers. This was the first liner to have a straight stern like a warship; and the advantages of this type of stern were revealed in terms of speed, vibration, steering and seagoing qualities.

&quot;Empress of Russia&quot;″s UK official number was 135197 and until 1933 her code letters were JBSQ. In 1934 her code letters were superseded by the call sign VGKW.

== World War I ==


&quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was requisitioned by the British Admiralty twice during the First World War. Initially, the ship was refitted as an armed merchant cruiser at Hong Kong; she was attached to a squadron blockading German merchant shipping in Philippine waters and retained her Chinese crew, but took on French sailors to man her guns. Later, she was transferred to the Indian Ocean.

In November 1914, the highlight of this Indian Ocean tour of duty followed from a rendezvous at sea with the Australian cruiser . In what was called the Battle of Cocos, &quot;Sydney&quot; had engaged the German cruiser , forcing the raider to beach herself on North Keeling Island to avoid sinking. Some 230 &quot;Emden&quot; survivors were transferred from &quot;Sydney&quot; to &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; for transport to Colombo. At this point, &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was sailing in a convoy of troop ships carrying 30,000 ANZACs from Albany, Australia to Suez and Europe.

On April 30, 1915, &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; sailed from Hong Kong to the Red Sea, where she served until October 1915.

In one incident, the guns of &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; were brought to bear on Hodeidah in what is modern Yemen. Bluntly, the Turks were told that if British and French consuls, who had been kidnapped, were not brought back, the port city would be demolished.

Shortly afterwards, &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was released by the Admiralty for a return to civilian service. The ship was refitted at Hong Kong, arriving there on 19 October, going into dock on 25 October and finally paying off on 12 February 1916. &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; then returned to her familiar trans-Pacific route. Amongst those sailing with &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; in this period was Sumner Welles, who was to become one of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy advisers.

In April 1917 &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; brought 2,056 members of the Chinese Labor Corps (CLC) from Weihaiwei in China across the Pacific to Williams Head on Vancouver Island. After quarantine the CLC were then transshipped to Port Moody on the Canadian mainland and transported by the Canadian Pacific Railway in guarded cattle trucks across Canada to the Atlantic Coast, where other Empress ships took them to Dunkirk.

The British Admiralty called &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; to wartime service for a second time in early 1918. She was to be used in transporting American troops to Europe.

&quot;Empress of Russia&quot;″s last wartime voyage began from Liverpool on 12 January 1919. She sailed to Le Havre where Chinese labor battalions boarded &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; for the return voyage via Suez to Hong Kong. From the Far East, she sailed across the Pacific to Vancouver for re-fitting.

This ship remained a coal-burner after the Great War, even though many liners at that time were being converted to oil.

== Between the wars ==
Between the wars, &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; resumed regular trans-Pacific crossings. Her first post-war voyage began on 10 April 1919; and the pre-war route was somewhat modified on this trip. On this occasion, she sailed from Vancouver to Manila outward bound; and she stopped at Vladivostok on the return voyage to North America from the Far East to pick up Canadian soldiers who had served at part of the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force during the Russian Revolution. In this period, &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; transported Philippine Senator Manuel L. Quezon on his return to Manila from the first Independence Mission to the US Congress in 1919.
These trans-Pacific sailings continued up through December 1940.

The routine nature of her schedule did nothing to diminish public interest in the comings and goings of &quot;Empress of Russia.&quot; For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; regularly published news of mail ships sailings. In an era when airplanes carrying mail was still relatively novel, for example, the newspaper published a regular &quot;Shipping and Mails&quot; column. In a 1938 edition, the &quot;Times&quot; reported:
During this peacetime period, she completed 310 crossings. Amongst the famous passengers who traveled on &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; were Chinese Nationalist leaders Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, who sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai in 1922; and American humorist Will Rogers who sailed to Japan in late-November 1932.

== World War II ==
&quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was again commissioned by the British Admiralty as a troop transport. Initially, she carried Australian and New Zealand Air Force recruits to Canada for flight school training. In March 1941, she was refitted at dockyards on the River Clyde in Scotland.

The captain of &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; in 1941–42 would only realize many years later that he had had a VIP aboard — a young Midshipman Philip Mountbatten (later to become Duke of Edinburgh) is remembered for having helped stoke the boilers in 1941.

&quot;Empress of Russia&quot; was involved in the North Africa landings in 1943. In October 1943, she made a special trip to Gothenburg to exchange prisoners of war. This was followed by seven trips to Reykjavík for the RAF.

In early 1944, she was used as an accommodation ship at Rosyth for Russian crews who were to take over a number of British warships. In June, she was moved to Spithead where she was used as a depot ship for tugs after the D-Day landings.

In October 1944, she sailed to Gareloch where she was laid up until June 1945. Work was begun on the refitting &quot;Empress of Russia&quot; for service transporting Canadian troops from Europe to North America; however, she was gutted by fire on 8 September 1945 at Barrow. The extensive damage caused the ship to be scrapped; and she was broken up by Thos. W. Ward.

<doc id="331470" wikidata="Q239977" url="?curid=331470" title="Albacore">
<text>The albacore (Thunnus alalunga), known also as the longfin tuna, is a species of tuna of the order Scombriformes. It is found in temperate and tropical waters across the globe in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. There are six distinct stocks known globally in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. The albacore has an elongate, body with a conical snout, large eyes, and remarkably long pectoral fins. Its body is a deep blue dorsally and shades of silvery white ventrally. Individuals can reach up to in length.

Albacore are pelagic predators that eat a wide variety of foods, including but not limited to fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. They are unique among tuna in that their primary food source is cephalopods, with fish making up a much smaller portion of their diet. Reproduction usually occurs from November to February and is oviparous. An adult female can release over two million eggs in a single cycle. Fry (juvenile fish) generally stay near where they were spawned for about a year before moving on. Albacore form schools based on their stage in the life cycle, but also combine with other tuna like the skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, and bluefin tuna. Once grown, schools are highly migratory.

The albacore is a very economically important fish and is a target of commercial and recreational fisheries. It was originally the basis for the United States tuna-canning industry and is no less important today, making up significant percentages of the gross domestic products of various Pacific nations. It was listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of the threat of overfishing but is now Least Concern again. Several stocks were in significant decline but are now recovering thanks to the enforcement of regional fishing quotas.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The first scientific description of the albacore was authored in 1788 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the illustrated encyclopedia &quot;Tableau encyclopédique et methodique des trois règnes de la nature&quot;. He originally placed it in the mackerel genus &quot;Scomber&quot;. It was assigned to the genus &quot;Thunnus&quot; by ichthyologists Bruce B. Collette and Cornelia E. Nauen in 1983. It is a member of the &quot;Thunnus&quot; subgenus, also known as the bluefin group. Populations of albacore differ genetically by region, with Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean groups each showing differences in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

==Description==

The albacore has a streamlined, fusiform body with a conical snout, large mouth, and big eyes. Its body is dark blue dorsally, shades of silvery white ventrally, and covered by small scales. The pectoral fins begin slightly before the first dorsal fin and extend well beyond the front of the anal fin, usually as far as the second dorsal finlet, often as long as 30% of the fish&#x27;s total length. Like the fish&#x27;s body, the fins are dark blue on top, but change to a medium yellow color on the underside. They are markedly shorter in fish under in length, often resulting in confusion with &quot;T. obesus&quot; juveniles, which also have long pectoral fins, though these are rounded at the tips where the albacore&#x27;s taper to a point. The first dorsal fin is a deep yellow and the second, which is smaller than the first, is a light yellow, as is the anal fin. It has 7–9 dorsal finlets and 7–8 anal finlets, dark blue and silvery white in color respectively, matching the part of the fish&#x27;s body they are on. The caudal fin is also silvery white. At maximum length, the albacore is the smallest of the bluefin tuna. It reaches sexual maturity at and its common length is only slightly larger at . Males and females exhibit no sexual dimorphism.

==Distribution and habitat==
The albacore has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical and temperate waters across the globe and in every ocean as well as the Mediterranean Sea.

Its latitudinal range extends from 59°N to 46°S. Its temperature range is . Its depth range is in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. It is most often found in surface waters in temperature, though larger individuals can be found in deeper waters . It can survive at temperatures as low as for short periods of time. It favors areas where warm and cool water mix.

==Migration==
A highly migratory species, schools of albacore travel great distances, though Atlantic and Pacific populations do not appear to mix. North Pacific albacore migrate to two regions of the Northeast Pacific: one off the northern part of Baja California, Mexico, and the other off the coasts of Washington and Oregon. Every summer, North Atlantic albacore head to the Bay of Biscay off of France and Spain, but now arrive about 8 days earlier than they did 40 years ago.

Since the 1970s the NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) has collaborated with American Fishermen&#x27;s Research Foundation (AFRF) in tagging studies of albacore in the North Pacific. Through these studies we have learned that juvenile albacore (to 2 years of age) make trans-Pacific migrations in their younger years between Japan and the West coast of North America. To date over 24,000 albacore have been tagged with conventional dart tags and 1,245 of these have been recovered. In Spring of 2001 AFRF and the SWFSC began a pilot project to learn more about the migration habits of North Pacific albacore, &quot;Thunnus alalunga&quot; in an effort to allow the incorporation of detailed migration movements into stock assessment models. Archival tags are a recent technical innovation that are being used to collect daily locations (through light level data recorded by the tag), internal temperature of the fish&#x27;s abdomen, ambient water temperature, and depth. Genetic research using ddRAD sequencing indicates that albacore migrate between the North and South Pacific oceans across the equator.

==Biology and ecology==

The albacore is a powerful, hard-hitting predator that forms mixed schools with skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, and bluefin tuna, sometimes around floating objects like sargassum weeds. Schools of albacore are highly migratory within bodies of water and segregated by maturity, with older fish tending to form more compact groups. Of those caught by humans, immature albacore have a 1:1 sex ratio while older albacore are mostly male. In the Atlantic Ocean, older fish are found in cooler waters. The opposite is true for the Pacific Ocean, where fish are found more abundantly along thermal discontinuities. Depth range also varies by location: Atlantic fish dive as deep as where Pacific fish reach only in depth. In the northeast Atlantic, feeding migrations to productive areas occur during the summer. Due to climate changes over the last 40 years, the timing and spatial distribution of the albacore have also changed.

Albacore show a broad range of behavioral differences by region. In Baja California, albacore make frequent dives to depths exceeding during the day and stay near the surface at night, while off the coast of Washington and Oregon they stay near the surface the entire day. Albacore never really rest; their need for oxygen means they must always be on the move.

===Feeding===
Albacore tuna are pelagic (open-sea) predators. Their diets vary little from season to season. Unlike other tuna that eat primarily fish, for example the bigeye and yellowfin tuna, the albacore&#x27;s main source of food is cephalopods. The most abundant cephalopod in its diet is &quot;Heteroteuthis dispar&quot;, a tiny deep-water squid found in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Another cephalopod species preyed upon is &quot;Berryteuthis anonychus&quot;. Other food sources of the albacore include fish (including &quot;Cololabis saira&quot;, &quot;Engraulis japonicus&quot;, and &quot;Engraulis mordax&quot;), crustaceans, and gelatinous organisms. Not much is known about the food pattern of the albacore, however, mostly because it dives over underwater when searching for food, and tagging and tracking has been unsuccessful thus far.

===Life history===
The albacore&#x27;s reproduction is oviparous and a female can produce between 2–3 million eggs per spawning, which usually takes place between November and February. Eggs mature outside of the female&#x27;s body and hatch in 1–2 days, after which fry begin to grow quickly. For the first year of their lives, juveniles remain close to the place where they were hatched. They begin to migrate after their first year. Albacore have a lifespan of 11–12 years, but they reach reproductive maturity at around 5–6 years.

A large majority of albacore have larger right testes or ovaries, depending on sex. Albacore have asynchronous oocyte development, that is their immature egg cells do not develop at regular intervals. The creation of ova, known as oogenesis, begins with the rapid production of oogonia (undifferentiated germ cells that give rise to oocytes) by mitotic separations in the oogonial nests of female tuna. The resulting oocytes are cast &quot;en masse&quot; into the sea, where full development and later fertilization take place.

==Human interaction==
===Commercial fishery===

Albacore is a prized food, and the albacore fishery is economically significant. Methods of fishing include pole and line, long-line fishing, trolling, and some purse seining.

The harvest of albacore tuna for commercial use began at the start of the 20th century. The migratory patterns of the fish brought droves of albacore schools near the coastline of southern California, which sparked the start of commercial albacore fishing. In 1903, 700 cases of albacore were used as an experimental pack which ultimately led to the development of the U.S. tuna-canning industry. The experiment was a huge success, and the commercial fishery expanded rapidly due to the high level of demand for canned tuna. By the 1920s, the industry expanded further and three other species of tuna—bluefin, yellowfin, and skipjack—were also being canned. Albacore tuna is the only species that can be marketed as &quot;white meat tuna&quot;. The canning industry uses this label to differentiate canned albacore from other types of tuna.

From 2010 to 2013, a study by Oceana, an ocean preservation organization, tested over 114 samples of tuna, and found that 84% of the white tuna samples were actually escolar.

Many Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) heavily rely on oceanic fisheries for economic development and food security. The albacore is one of the main four species of tuna that support oceanic fisheries along with the skipjack, yellowfin, and the bigeye tunas. Domestic tuna fleets and local fish processing operations contribute from 3–20% of the gross domestic product in four PICTs. License fees from foreign ships provide an average of 3–40% of government revenue for seven different PICTs. Processing facilities and tuna fishing vessels provide more than 12,000 jobs for workers in the Pacific islands. Fish provide 50–90% of dietary animal protein in rural areas of PICTs.

===Recreational fishery===
Albacore are sought after by sport fishers. Since 2000, a large recreational fishery for albacore has been established in Oregon, Washington and California. The fisheries in Oregon and Washington are supported by seasonal warm water influxes from the California Current with the season lasting from mid-July until October.

===Conservation===
====Fisheries management====

Albacore are managed by four tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMO&#x27;s): the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). ICCAT has established catch quotas in the North and South Atlantic.

There are six globally managed stocks of albacore worldwide, one in the North Pacific, one in the South Pacific, another in the Indian Ocean, two for the North and South Atlantic, and one in the Mediterranean Sea.

There is substantial uncertainty on current stock status, since different models and assumptions provide a wide range of estimates. However, most of them agreed on the view that spawning stock biomass decreased since the 1930s and started to recover since the mid-1990s. Most of the model formulations, as well as the base case, concluded that currently the stock is not undergoing overfishing but the spawning stock biomass is overfished. IOTC judges albacore in the Indian Ocean are not overfished, but maintaining or increasing effort in the core albacore fishing grounds is likely to result in further declines in albacore biomass. All of the tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations noted that there is uncertainty surrounding the life history and biology of tunas and tuna like species including age and growth, maturity, and natural mortality rates; uncertainty about the quality and completeness of available data; and uncertainty about recruitment.

The WCPFC has assessed the South Pacific Albacore are not overfished.

In the 2014 assessment, the Albacore Working Group of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in North Pacific Ocean found estimates of total stock biomass (age 1 and older) show a long-term decline from the early 1970s to 1990 followed by a recovery through the 1990s and subsequent fluctuations without trend in the 2000s. The working group concludes that the stock is likely not in an overfished condition at present.

South Pacific albacore stocks have recently (2007 to 2015) shown a 40% reduction in stock.

Population genomic research supports the distinction of separate North and South Pacific stocks, but results indicated that interbreeding occurs between these populations and some potential migrants were genetically identified.

====Other organizations====
A number of programs have been developed to help consumers identify and support responsible and sustainable fisheries. Perhaps the most widely accepted of these programs is that of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Several albacore fisheries have been certified as sustainable according to MSC standards, including the U.S. North and South Pacific albacore pole and line and troll/jig fisheries (&quot;pole and troll&quot;), Canadian North Pacific troll fishery, and the New Zealand South Pacific troll fishery.

SeaChoice ranks albacore as a &quot;best choice&quot; for consumers, although notes some &quot;moderate concerns&quot; regarding the management effectiveness (in particular, no definitive assessment of the albacore stock of the Indian Ocean fishery has taken place), and &quot;moderate concern&quot; over the fishing stock, especially regarding the North Atlantic albacore population, which the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) considers overfished with overfishing still occurring. In 2007, SeaChoice considered the southern Atlantic stock to be overfished but not currently experiencing overfishing. They regarded North Pacific albacore stocks as not overfished and not likely to be experiencing overfishing.

===Mercury levels===

Like other fish, albacore accumulate methylmercury in body tissue over time. Methylmercury is removed from the human body naturally, but it may take over a year for the levels to drop significantly. Thus, it may remain in a woman from before she becomes pregnant. Ranging from as low as 0.027 ppm (parts per million) to 0.26 ppm, the average total mercury content of albacore is 0.14 ± 0.05 ppm. Larger fish tend to bioaccumulate higher methylmercury levels. For the most part, there is positive correlation between an albacore&#x27;s methylmercury measurement and its weight and length. Albacore caught by the American albacore fishing fleet off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California have far lower mercury levels than in previous years. Albacore caught in this region also show methylmercury levels well below the 1.0 ppm mercury standard set by The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nevertheless, since mercury does take time to be removed from the body, albacore tuna should be eaten in moderation.

===Cuisine=== 

As with other tunas, albacore meat is a versatile ingredient that is used a wide variety of dishes.

<doc id="331473" wikidata="Q1147813" url="?curid=331473" title="Chinese characters of Empress Wu">
<text>The Chinese characters of Empress Wu, or the Zetian characters (), are Chinese characters introduced by Empress Wu Zetian, the only empress regnant in the history of China, in order to demonstrate her power. The characters were not created by the Empress herself, but were suggested by an official named Zong Qinke, the son of one of her cousins, in December, 689 AD. The number of characters varies between 12, 17, 19, or 30. Her subjects were forced to use them during her reign, but they fell into disuse immediately after her death, so they help to determine dates of printed materials.

A few of the surviving characters are preserved in the written histories of Wu Zetian, and a few have found themselves incorporated into modern-day computer standards, classified as either variant or dialect-specific characters.

The form of the characters varies depending on where they are printed. For instance, Empress Wu&#x27;s own name &quot;zhào&quot; was replaced with one of two new characters created through her: or ; looking in the Kangxi Dictionary, one finds the description of the former, having two (&quot;eye&quot;) characters, being the proper character, rather than &quot;míng&quot; (&quot;bright&quot;).

==History==
Wu was China&#x27;s only empress, and she exercised her power by introducing many reforms. In addition to changing the way people dressed, she wanted to change the words people used.

Empress Wu&#x27;s written reforms resulted in new characters, which were not created from scratch, but borrowed elements of older characters.

Although the characters quickly fell into disuse after the end of Wu&#x27;s reign, they were recorded in large dictionaries and a few have occasionally appeared as variant characters used in proper names. For instance, 圀 (&#x27;country&#x27;, &#x27;state&#x27;) is used to write the name of &quot;daimyō&quot; Tokugawa Mitsukuni () in kanji. In this context, the character is given the kun&#x27;yomi reading &quot;kuni&quot; as a variant of orthodox characters / (in shinjitai and kyūjitai, respectively).

Anecdotes about the reign of Empress Wu and the creation of these characters can be read in the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;.

<text>GenOn Energy, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, United States, is an energy company that provides electricity to wholesale customers in the United States. The company is one of the largest independent power producers in the nation with more than 7,000 megawatts of power generation capacity across the United States using natural gas, fuel oil and coal. GenOn Energy was headquartered in the Reliant Energy Plaza in Downtown Houston. The company, formerly known as RRI Energy, acquired Mirant on December 3, 2010. The corporate names and logos of both RRI Energy and Mirant were retired.

NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012 for $1.7 billion. GenOn&#x27;s stock ceased trading and was exchanged for NRG stock.

== History ==
The company was originally known as Houston Industries (), and Houston Lighting &amp; Power was its subsidiary. In August 1996 HI closed on a merger with NorAm Energy Corp, a natural gas utility. The combined company, as of 1997, had assets of $18 billion and annual revenues of about $9 billion. By November 1997 there was a published report stating that the company wished to acquire Central &amp; South West Corp. HI declined to comment.

In 1999, Houston Industries changed its name to Reliant Energy and its new NYSE symbol was REI. It was scheduled to begin trading under REI on February 8, 1999.

In 2002, Texas deregulated the electricity market and Reliant then competed against other energy companies like Direct Energy and TXU Energy. At this time, Reliant Energy also separated into two publicly traded companies: Reliant Resources, Inc. and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ().

When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former HL&amp;P was split into several companies. In 2003 HL&amp;P was split into Reliant Energy, Texas Genco, and CenterPoint Energy.

CenterPoint Energy was created when Reliant Energy merged with an indirect subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. As a result of the merger, Reliant Energy shareholders received one share of CenterPoint common stock in exchange for each share of RRI common stock they held before the merger. A regulated utility, CenterPoint Energy became one of the largest U.S. energy delivery companies, serving 4.7 million metered customers. In late 2002, CenterPoint distributed the stock of Reliant Resources, Inc. to CenterPoint shareholders. This spin-off created Reliant Resources with a strategy to provide competitive wholesale and retail energy service under the Reliant Energy brand. Its businesses included power generation and retail energy services in Texas newly deregulated electricity market. On the wholesale side, Reliant owned, had an interest in, or leased 37 operating power generation facilities serving five regions of the United States.

In January 2007, the Texas electricity market became fully deregulated, and Reliant began to offer an array of products, flexible service options, and pricing arrangements to a variety of customers. At this time, Reliant was the second largest mass market electricity provider in the state of Texas, with an annual revenue of $10.9 billion and more than 3,500 employees. In February 2007, Reliant Energy announced plans for Mark Jacobs, current chief financial operator, to succeed Joel Staff as chief executive officer and for Brian Landrum to become chief operating officer.

On May 1, 2009, Reliant Energy&#x27;s retail electricity business was purchased by NRG Energy. The retail group retained the name Reliant Energy and the surviving wholesale business was renamed RRI Energy, Inc.

On June 15, 2017, unable to meet debt obligations, GenOn Energy and GenOn Americas Generation file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

===Merger to create GenOn Energy===

On April 11, 2010, RRI Energy and Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. announced an agreement to merge in a $1.6 billion all-stock deal, which created one of the largest independent power plant operators in the country. The new company, named GenOn Energy, would be based in Houston but led by Mirant&#x27;s Chairman and CEO Edward Muller until 2013. At that time, Muller would retire and Mark Jacobs, the president and COO of RRI Energy, would become CEO of GenOn. The new company had a market capitalization of about $3 billion, owning or operating 47 plants in 12 states capable of generating more than 24,650 megawatts of power. The merger was completed on December 3, 2010.

==California energy crisis==

In March 2004, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment against Reliant Energy Services, Inc. and four of its officers—Jackie Thomas, a former vice president of Reliant&#x27;s Power Trading Division; Reggie Howard, a former director of Reliant&#x27;s West Power Trading Division; Lisa Flowers, a term trader for Reliant&#x27;s West Power Trading Division; and Kevin Frankeny, Reliant&#x27;s manager of western operations—for their alleged role in the California electricity crisis. All of the defendants are residents of Texas.

The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and commodities manipulation and wire fraud, as well as manipulation and attempted manipulation of the price of a commodity in interstate commerce. The indictments were filed on April 8, 2004. On August 15, 2005, Reliant announced that it had reached a $445 million settlement with the states of California, Oregon and Washington, resolving civil litigation claims against the company related to the sale of electricity in the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001. In March 2007, Reliant agreed to pay a $22.2 million penalty in addition to a $13.8 million credit provided in a previous settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

==Environmental record==
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified Reliant Energy as the 36th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly 34 million pounds of toxic chemicals released into the air every year. Major pollutants indicated by the study include sulfuric and hydrochloric acid as well as manganese, chromium, and nickel compounds.

In December 2007, the US state of New Jersey sued Reliant Energy, claiming that emissions from a Pennsylvania coal-fired power plant hurt the state&#x27;s air quality. New Jersey claims emissions of smog and acid rain components sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from Reliant&#x27;s Portland Generating Station in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, drift into its territory. The lawsuit also claims that Reliant violated the federal Clean Air Act by modifying and operating the plant without required pollution control equipment and construction permits. In February 2012, in response to an EPA ruling, GenOn Energy announced they would be shutting down the Portland Generating Station in 2015.

Reliant Energy claims to have made efforts toward more environmentally safe practices through the use of renewable resources such as solar energy, wind power, landfill gas, and coal refuse.

<doc id="331490" wikidata="Q53119" url="?curid=331490" title="Honam Line">
<text>The Honam Line is a major railway line serving the Honam region (North and South Jeolla Provinces) in South Korea. The line is served by frequent passenger trains from Seoul (via the Gyeongbu Line) to Gwangju and Mokpo.

== History ==
A Honam Railway from Seoul to Mokpo was first proposed in 1896 by a French company. After the start of the Russo-Japanese War, in May 1904, Imperial Japan forced Korea to sign an agreement granting the Japanese military control over railways, including the right to seize land. Japan the seized much of the fertile Honam plain in advance of a planned Honam Line.

The construction of the line started in 1910. The first between Daejeon and Yeonsan was opened in July 1911. The line was extended to Ganggyeong in November 1911, to Iri (today Iksan) in March 1912, to Gimje in October 1912 and to Jeongeup in December 1912. Construction continued from the other end of the line, with the section from Mokpo to Hakgyo (today Hampyeong) opened in May 1913; and extended to Naju in July 1913, to Songjeong-ri (today Gwangju·Songjeong) in October 1913, and finally to Jeongeup, completing the line on January 11, 1914.

=== Upgrade ===
==== Duplication ====
The Honam Line was upgraded to an electrified and double-tracked line for higher speeds in stages. The construction of the double track began on January 4, 1968. On March 30, 1978, the section from Daejeonjochajang station to Iksan Station via Seodaejeon Station was double-tracked. The double-track work for the section south of Iksan Station on the Honam Line began in February 1981, and the double-track work was completed to Songjeong-ri Station in Gwangju on September 6, 1988.

Double-tracking of the last remaining single-track section, Songjeong–Mokpo, and the electrification of the whole line, including the Gwangju spur, was finished for the start of Korea Train Express (KTX) services on April 1, 2004. The present line length from Daejeon to Mokpo is , the line distance from Seoul to Mokpo is .

==== Speeding-up upgrade ====
To serve KTX and SRT, section from GwangjuSongjeong to Gomagwon was upgraded to accomplish maximum speed of 230 km/h. Total length of the project is 25.9 km and it was completed in June 2020.

== Major stations ==
Major stations and junctions along the line include:

*Daejeon, junction with the Gyeongbu Line to Seoul and Busan;
*Seodaejeon, the Daejeon passenger station for Honam Line trains;
*Iksan (formerly named &quot;Iri&quot;), the terminus of the Jeolla and Janghang Lines;
*GwangjuSongjeong, the major station in Gwangju for through trains to Mokpo, and the junction with the Gyeongjeon Line;
*Naju, the major station in Naju;
*Mokpo, a seaport on the south coast.

== Services ==
The Honam Line is served by freight trains, as well as cross-country Mugunghwa-ho, intercity ITX-Saemaeul/MAUM and high-speed KTX passenger trains.

As of October 2024, the minimum travel time from Yongsan Station in Seoul to Mokpo in South Jeolla Province is at least 4 hours and 20 minutes for ITX-MAUM and at least 5 hours and 14 minutes for Mugunghwa. Even on the Honam Line from Seodaejeon to Mokpo itself, the travel time is at least 2 hours and 34 minutes for ITX-MAUM and at least 3 hours and 4 minutes for Mugunghwa.

<doc id="331506" wikidata="Q1179312" url="?curid=331506" title="Dazz Band">
<text>Dazz Band is an American R&amp;B/funk band most popular in the early 1980s. Emerging from Cleveland, Ohio, the group&#x27;s biggest hit songs include &quot;Let It Whip&quot; (1982), &quot;Joystick&quot; (1983), and &quot;Let It All Blow&quot; (1984). The name of the band is a portmanteau of the description &quot;danceable jazz&quot;.

==History==
Dazz Band formed in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1976, stemming from the jazz fusion band Bell Telefunk. Founded by Bobby Harris, Dazz Band has performed since 1976 and continues to perform today. Original Kinsman Dazz/ Dazz Band members included Bobby Harris (saxophonist, vocalist), Kenny Pettus (lead vocalist, percussions), Isaac &quot;Ike&quot; Wiley, Jr. (drums), his brother Michael Wiley (bassist), and Michael Calhoun (songwriter/guitarist). The group was originally named Kinsman Dazz at the suggestion of Ray Calabrese, who later became its manager along with Sonny Jones, owner of The Kinsman Grill, located near the street Harris grew up on, and where the band worked as a house band.

Kinsman Dazz was signed to 20th Century Records in 1977, and the group expanded from the original quintet consisting of Harris, Calhoun, Pettus, and the Wiley brothers and added newcomers Ed Meyers (trombone), Wayne Preston (saxophonist), and Les Thaler (trumpet). In 1977, the group went to Los Angeles to record with producer Marvin Gaye. Due to illness, Gaye was unable to complete the project. Harris requested and got Philip Bailey, the vocalist of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, to produce the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Kinsman Dazz&quot;. They released their first single, &quot;I Might as Well Forget About Loving You&quot; in 1978. Philip Bailey made significant contributions to the group&#x27;s vocal arrangements and overall sound. He also co-produced the second album &quot;Dazz&quot; in 1979, when the band achieved their second charting hit, &quot;Catchin&#x27; Up on Love&quot;.

In 1980, the Kinsman Dazz changed its name to Dazz Band, after being signed to Motown Records, which simultaneously included a re-organization of members. Wayne Preston and Les Thaler were no longer with the group, and Sennie &quot;Skip&quot; Martin, (trumpet, vocals), Pierre DeMudd (trumpet, vocals; April 20, 1953 – May 10, 2017), and Kevin Kendricks (keyboards) were added. In 1981, guitarist Eric Fearman was also added.

Dazz Band&#x27;s first album for Motown was &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; (1980). The album&#x27;s title track began a string of hits starting in March 1981. The group&#x27;s next album &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (1981) featured the single &quot;Knock! Knock!&quot; which reached the top 50. Dazz Band&#x27;s breakthrough came with the hit &quot;Let It Whip&quot;, written and produced by Reggie Andrews, from their &quot;Keep It Live&quot; (1982) album. &quot;Let It Whip&quot; reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Members of the Grammy Award winning Dazz Band included: Sennie &quot;Skip&quot; Martin, Pierre DeMudd, Bobby Harris, Eric Fearman, Kenny Pettus, Steve Cox, Keith Harrison, Michael Wiley and Isaac Wiley.

On December 31, 1982, during Dazz Band&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at the Front Row Theatre in Cleveland, Mayor George V. Voinovich presented Bobby Harris and Dazz Band the Key to the City with proclamations from the State of Ohio. Dazz Band continued to score R&amp;B hits with the songs such as &quot;Party Right Here&quot; (1983), &quot;On the One for Fun&quot; (1983) &quot;Joystick&quot; (1983), and &quot;Let It All Blow&quot; (also their biggest UK hit single, peaking at No. 12 in 1984).

Andrews produced five Dazz Band albums: &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (1981), &quot;Keep It Live&quot; (1982), &quot;On the One&quot; (1983), &quot;Joystick&quot; (1983) and &quot;Jukebox&quot; (1984), all on the Motown label. Harris was the associate producer on all five albums, and producer of the album &quot;Hot Spot&quot; (1985), also on Motown. After winning the Grammy in 1982, Keith Harrison (1983) (vocalist, keyboards) was added to the group. In 1985, both Eric Fearman and Sennie &quot;Skip&quot; Martin (trumpet, vocalist) left the group and were replaced by guitarist Marlon McClain; and the search began for additional vocalists that would match the Dazz Band sound. In 1986, Dazz Band recorded &quot;Wild &amp; Free&quot; (1986), which featured Jerry Bell as lead vocalist, and was released by Geffen Records.

Dazz Band signed with RCA Records in 1988 and released the album &quot;Rock the Room&quot;, which charted with the single &quot;Anticipation&quot; featuring vocals from Juan Lively. From 1994 until 2001, Terry Stanton (vocalist) contributed on its albums &quot;Funkology&quot; (1994) and &quot;Under the Streetlights&quot; (1995). After serving as lead vocalist with Kool &amp; the Gang for many years, Sennie &quot;Skip&quot; Martin returned to performing and recording with Dazz Band in 1997, and recorded on &quot;Double Exposure&quot; (1997), recorded live in Seattle, Washington, and shared lead vocals with Terry Stanton on &quot;Time Traveler&quot; (2001) on Major Hits Records. In 2014, Harris added vocalist Donny Sykes to the band. Cleveland native, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Alvin Frazier was added to the group in 2021. The band released &quot;Drop It&quot; in 2019, their first single in almost 20 years, on the Bogi Music Group label.

===1990s revival===
Following the infusion of rap into American music, many classic funk/R&amp;B/soul acts in the US began performing abroad. In the late 1990s, Harris, along with the support of business entrepreneur Bo Boviard and long time friend and band member Marlon McClain, decided to revitalize funk in America and called upon members from the Bar-Kays, Con Funk Shun, Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band, the S.O.S. Band, and Dazz Band, for a project entitled &#x27;United We Funk All-Stars&#x27;. A studio album followed that included Roger Troutman of Zapp. The concept was a success, and was captured on a live CD (Major Hits Records) promoted by syndicated radio host Tom Joyner.

==Trademark dispute==
In November 2012, former Kinsman Dazz member Michael Calhoun applied for registration of the Kinsman Dazz Trademark along with Raymon W. Phillips. Michael Calhoun was released from the group in 1981. 
Two years later, in January 2014 Michael Calhoun again applied for trademark, this time going after the Dazz Band name along with former vocalist Jerry Bell, (Wild &amp; Free) former trombone player Ed Meyers, Robert Young, and Larry Blake (both unknown to Harris). In March 2015, their mark was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Upon learning of both registrations, Harris secured legal representation from former US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Judge, Gary Krugman, at Sughrue Mion in Washington D.C. Petitions to cancel both fraudulent marks were filed with the United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. After two years of legal filings, and a series of unsuccessful attempts to stop Dazz Band performances the fraudulent Dazz Band mark was cancelled in April 2017 by the USTTAB, and then granted to its rightful owner Leader/ Founder Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Harris. Petition to cancel the Kinsman Dazz mark held by Michael Calhoun and Raymon Philips was granted in August 2015, by the United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

<text>The Old Regular Baptist denomination is one of the oldest in Appalachia with roots in both the Regular and Separate Baptists of the American Colonies and the Particular Baptist of Great Britain. This group has seen a marked decline in its membership during the last two decades. Part of the decline may be attributable to orthodox biblical interpretations like a dress code where men must wear long pants, not shorts, and women must wear long dresses. Other such interpretations include women not being allowed to cut their hair or speak publicly on church business, although women can frequently shout while praising. Members who do not comply with the strict dress code and practices face losing their membership in the congregation. The Old Regular Baptist faith still remains the dominant faith in some rural Central Appalachian counties along or near the Kentucky-Virginia border. In most churches, the congregation maintains a collection of photographs of deceased members.

==History==
The Old Regular Baptist Churches of Jesus Christ in the United States, along with the Regular Primitive Baptists, trace their history to churches that sprang up in the American Colonies. These early churches had been organized as Regular Baptist Churches and Separate Baptist Churches in Christ, and were found from New England to Georgia. A great migration took place in the American Colonies, and many pioneer Baptists migrated to western parts of Virginia and into Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1802 the North District Association was formed from the South Kentucky Association, which was organized in 1788. The North District gave off the Burning Springs in 1813, which created the New Salem Association in 1825. There were churches and associations being organized likewise in western and southwestern Virginia. In 1800, the Greenbrier Association gave off Teays Valley Association. In 1811 the Washington District Association was organized as a Regular Baptist Association, although its origins are from the Holston Association which was organized in 1786 by the authority of the Sandy Creek Separate Baptist Association. The Sandy Creek Separate Baptist self-organized in 1756. The Washington District Association, however, upon being organized adopted the Preambles and the Constitution of the Regular Baptists.

The Old Regular Baptist Churches of today can be likewise be traced, directly or indirectly, to churches who were involved with these older associations. Others were involved as ministers and members of the Elkhorn Association, organized in 1765. The Licking Association organized in 1810, the Philadelphia organized in 1707, and the Ketockton organized on August 19, 1766, joining and organizing churches that were to become the Old Regular Baptist.

The New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptists was established in 1825, this association being an arm of the Burning Springs Association. The New Salem Association has undergone several name changes, from &quot;Baptist&quot; to &quot;Regular United&quot; in 1854, to &quot;Regular Primitive&quot; in 1870, to &quot;Regular Baptist&quot; in 1871, and then in 1892 to &quot;Old Regular&quot;. Names that were synonymous with &quot;Old Regular Baptist&quot; (at least in the early history of this faith) include the Regular Predestinarian Baptist, Particular Baptist, Old School Baptist, United Baptist, Regular Primitive Baptist, and Old School or Old Order of Regular Baptist Churches and Associations. These terms held the same general meaning, and have been used interchangeably by many of the associations mentioned.

There have been several Old Regular Baptist associations and churches that have origins other than through the New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptists. The Burning Springs Association (1813), Red Bird Association (1823), Mountain Association (1856), and Red River Association (1876) were all directly descended from the North District Association. The Mud River Association (1888), Twin Creek Association (1850), Spencer Association (1898), and others originated from different clusters of churches and associations. In Virginia and elsewhere, some Old Regular Baptist Churches descended from the Sandy Creek Association Churches, along with churches from the Washington Association and Three Forks of Powell Valley Association. There are Old Regular Baptist Churches that were formed from or contained members who came directly with letters from the Philadelphia and Ketocton Association&#x27;s Churches along with the Yadkin, Holston, Kehukee, and Roaring River Association Churches. The Twin Creek Association formed from a split in the Licking River Particular Baptist Association in 1850. The Twin Creek Association was one of the first associations in Kentucky to title itself &quot;Old Regular Baptist&quot; in 1850. The churches that made up the Twin Creek Association had roots in the Elkhorn Association Regular Baptist Association (Kentucky). When the Twin Creek Association of Old Regular Baptist dissolved, the remaining churches went into the North District Association by letter. 
The Mud River Association originated from a split in the Pocatalico Particular Baptist Association in 1888. The Mud River used the title &quot;Primitive Baptist&quot; in correspondence with the New Salem Association for many years, and later titled itself &quot;Regular&quot; or &quot;Old Regular Baptist&quot;&quot;.&quot; The Sandlick Regular Primitive Association and the Mates Creek Regular Primitive Baptist are both descendants of the New Salem Old Regular Baptist Association. These associations, and the Burning Springs Association, all used the name &quot;Regular&quot; and &quot;Old Regular&quot; along with &quot;Primitive&quot; interchangeably. The word &quot;Old&quot; was added to &quot;Regular Baptist&quot; soon after many Regular Baptists had joined and began to correspond with mission boards. This was done to distinguish the Old (or original) Regular Baptists from the New School Baptists that had emerged throughout the United States. The terms &quot;Old School&quot;, &quot;Old Regular&quot;, &quot;Old Order&quot;, and &quot;Primitive&quot; came into usage during the same time period and were being added to the Baptist name to show they were of the old form of worship and had rejected what they considered modern innovations, such as Sunday or Sabbath Schools, theological seminaries, missions boards and the like.

The Old Regular Baptist in the late 1800s became concerned over the doctrines of &quot;absolute&quot; predestination, Actual Eternal Vital Union (also called Eternal Children Doctrine), and the Atonement. The 1892 Minutes of the New Salem Association stated that the New Salem Association feared the doctrine of an absolute predestination of all things that made God the author of man&#x27;s sins, and the doctrine of Arminianism that taught the works of the creature to be essential to eternal salvation. A circular letter in the Three Forks of Powell River began to circulate supporting Actual Eternal Vital Union. Debates within churches became more frequent as believers became more extreme in their views.

The Old Regular Baptists of Central Appalachia have, in fact, experienced several different divisions through the years over doctrine and practice. In the late 19th century to early 20th century, they had major splits over the doctrines of Absolute Predestination, Actual Eternal Vital Union, and Eternal Creation theories; this was the cause of their largest split ever, in combination with their differences over the Atonement and Election doctrines that escalated splits and divisions. Three of New Salem&#x27;s daughter churches, the Union, the Mates Creek, and the Sandlick, divided. The New Salem Association also dropped correspondence with the Burning Springs Association, her mother church, because New Salem believed that Burning Springs had members that belonged to secret orders. The United Baptist Associations were dropped for Secret Order and Mourners Benches. 

In the 1960s, a debate started over when eternal life began. There are Old Regular Baptists that hold the same views as other Primitive Baptist bodies (both Old Line and Absolute Predestination Primitive Baptist) on regeneration, that one is regenerated instantaneously on hearing the Voice of the Son of God (John 5:25). These Old School Regular Baptist hold strictly that eternal life and salvation are given first in a free gift by the grace of God and that the elect are called by a holy calling (II Timothy 1:9). This effectual call is referenced as the &quot;Light of Christ&quot; doctrine (I Peter 2:9), also known as the &quot;Light is Life&quot; doctrine. This view teaches that faith and repentance are the effects of regeneration, and not the cause of regeneration. They hold that the individual is quickened by the Spirit, and has everlasting life prior to belief and repentance. The gospel brings life and immortality to light, but has no part in regeneration. Conversion is manifested by true faith and repentance, in which a Godly sorrow sets up in the quickened individual&#x27;s heart and they are sorrowed to repentance and mourning. After the Godly sorrow has sorrowed them to repentance, they profess a burden of sin being removed and take comfort in the gospel and express an experience of grace. Old Regular Baptists holding those views (monergism) are often derided as the &quot;Hardshell Side&quot;. The synergist side holds that a man must repent and believe in order to be regenerated, and that through the Creature obeying, making up his mind, taking heed to the light and call, he then is enabled by grace and the light that leads one to life. They reject an effectual call, the belief that light is not synonymous with life, and the belief that a creature can reject the light and be lost eternally. This is referred to as the &quot;Softshell Side&quot;. There is one side of the Synergistic Old Regular Baptist that teaches that God dealt to every man universally a &quot;measure of faith&quot;, and it must be put to work by the creature in order for salvation to occur. This teaching has been recorded in the minutes of some of the Conditional Salvation Advocates Annual Association. There are ministers within the Old Regular Baptist that hold the &quot;Duty of Faith&quot; and &quot;Measure of Faith&quot; doctrines as heresy, and claim it was invented in the 1960s in Southwestern Virginia, after the Light of Christ division came about. Any prior reference to the terminology in Old Regular Baptist records or usage uses the &quot;Measure of Faith&quot; to mean a gift to the regenerated and not the unregenerated.

The Old Regular Baptist in Appalachia were more tolerant in doctrine, originally allowing for different views on the atonement. This stems from an earlier agreement made by the Regular and Separate Baptists when forming the United Baptists in Kentucky. While the doctrine of some traditional Old Regular Baptists (Gillites) would be in harmony with the London or Philadelphia Confessions of Faith advocating Limited or Particular Atonement, others among the Old Regulars hold to a more modified Calvinism and to Andrew Fuller&#x27;s view of the atonement. There are also some ministers and members that hold to a modified General Atonement belief. The original compromise on the Atonement made by the Regular and Separate Baptist was never kept, and it led to doctrinal splits on the Atonement issue which were widespread throughout Appalachia. Statements were made by some of the Mountain Associations that Christ made a full atonement for all those that have believed, and that these believers were the elect chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. This statement seemed to satisfy the different factions for a while. The Red Bird, Red River, Spencer, Sandlick, Mates Creek, Burning Springs, Mountain, Rock Springs, North District, Licking, Mud River, Twin Creek, and parts of the New Salem and Union Associations of Old Regular Baptist held to Special or Limited Atonement. Strict Particular Atonement was the doctrine of the Washington, Pocatalico, Three Forks of Powell River, the Elkhorn of West Virginia, the majority side of Mates Creek and Sandlick Associations, and part of the Union Association. The New Salem Association corresponded with the limited atonement side of the Union Association after the split, and then later switched sides, and took correspondence with the side holding more to a Fullerite View. 

Elder J.C Swindle from Three Forks of Powell Valley and Elder N.T Hopkins from New Salem were champions of Andrew Fuller&#x27;s Atonement view, to the point that Elder N.T Hopkins declared the Fullerite view to be the doctrine of the New Salem Association from the Pulpit. This caused several delegates representing their home churches within New Salem to abruptly leave the association, with their church letters in hand, along with sister Old Regular Baptist Association&#x27;s delegates with their association letters. These delegates, churches, and associations all held to a Strict or Special Limited atonement. In one of the New Salem Association&#x27;s oldest Churches, the Stone Coal Church of Garrett, Kentucky, the delegates walked out and eventually the church divided into two bodies, an Absolute Predestination side and Limited Predestination side. The Limited Predestination side believed that God predestinated the salvation of His elect people, but denied that every event that occurs in time was predestinated. They believed in a common salvation (timely or in time that involved actions of the creature) and an eternal salvation (the sole work of the creator with no action of the creature). The Absolute Predestination side held every event that came to pass was predestinated of God. 

Amazingly, after several years apart, under the ministry of Elder Marion Chaffins both factions came back together. Several of the churches that walked out after N.T Hopkins&#x27; sermon were reconciled back to the New Salem Association, and the ministers decided among themselves to just preach the scriptures and that Christ died for all that believe and repent through Grace. The New Salem Association at one time contained ministers holding to three different views on the atonement, and was thereafter able to exist fairly peacefully. 

During the 1960s, The &quot;Light of Christ&quot; or &quot;Light is Life&quot; division took place within the Union Association of Old Regular Baptists. This division was an argument over when eternal life was given, both sides holding that it was a gift given in time. This was the second time the Union Association had a large division over doctrine. The fallout of the Light of Christ division soon spread to other associations, being brought on by requests sent to them from the Union Association. This split resulted in the isolation of the Mud River Association, which advocated regeneration prior to faith and repentance, and the formation of the Bethel Association. The Elders in the Mud River Association were more sympathetic to the doctrine of the six churches that left the Union Association. The Union Association&#x27;s expulsion of the Bold Camp Church was considered a violation of the Union&#x27;s Constitution by most Elders versed in discipline. There were seven churches that left the Union Association (Bold Camp, Bethel, Mount Olive, Hylton, Longs Fork, Turner, Rose Hill), and others who felt the Union dismissed Bold Camp in error. The seven churches that left formed the Bethel Association of Old Regular Baptists. 

The New Salem Association leadership, seeing the chaos in the Union Association, chose not to divide over the Light of Christ issue. Today there are still debates among the Old Regular Baptist churches over issues such as when one receives faith, men and women&#x27;s dress, the receiving of divorced members, and the doctrinal differences over hope and knowledge. Some Old Regular Baptists hold to some points of Arminianism, while others are more Calvinistic. There are several factions of Old Regular Baptists presently, including the Old Regular Primitive Baptists who include the Mother Association (Burning Springs) and Daughter Associations of the New Salem (Mates Creek, Sandlick and Union). There remains Churches and Associations that remain in direct doctrinal sympathy with the Old Line Primitive Baptist. There are also factions of Old Regular Baptist that are in doctrinal sympathy with the &quot;Old&quot; United Baptist. These &quot;Old&quot; United Baptist share the same heritage as the Old Regular and Primitive Baptist Churches and are Old School in practice.

In the 1990s, a debate arose in the Northern New Salem Association over one of its member churches&#x27; use of fermented wine vs. grape juice in communion (wine being the original Regular Baptist custom). A query was sent into the Association by a sister church against the church that used wine. All evidence shows that the church that sent the query had not taken the proper steps according to Old Regular Baptist decorum. The Association involved itself, failing to send the query back to the church that sent it, and thereby violated its own orders. This led to two member churches breaking fellowship with the Northern New Salem Association. The two member churches, and one formed later, lettered to the Original Mountain Liberty Association and was found to be orthodox and orderly and were dismissed to form the Sovereign Grace Association in 1997. The Sovereign Grace Association&#x27;s doctrine would be in total harmony with the Old Line Primitive Baptists of today, or close to the Original Philadelphia Association of the past.

==Faith and practice==

The theology of the Old Regular Baptists is &quot;election by grace&quot;, as stated in the scripture: &quot;By Grace are ye saved through faith.&quot; While all Old Regulars preach &quot;election by grace&quot;, a difference of opinion exists among them concerning election and predestination. Today, depending on which faction one hears preach, their doctrine ranges from absolute predestination to man being a free moral agent. The majority of Old Regular Baptists hold to a doctrine that is between these extremes, with absolutism the smallest minority. The Old Regular Baptists are united in their eschatology, all factions hold that the binding of Satan took place during Christ&#x27;s earthly ministry and that the thousand years is to be taken symbolically rather than representing a measure of time. Old Regular Baptists all believe in experimental grace, baptism by immersion, and a called and regularly ordained ministry. Old Regular Baptist factions are in agreement in believing that Christ is the Eternal Son of God, that he is now, has been, and always will be Christ. Old Regular Baptists hold to the Godhead Three in One, The Scriptures Old and New Testament being the written Word of God and infallibility thereof, using the King James Bible exclusively, sinners being called to repentance, both faith and repentance being required prior to baptism, and justification being by the Imputed Righteousness of God.

Churches form local associations by which they &quot;fellowship&quot; with one another. This fellowship is formally maintained by the election of correspondents to attend the meetings of the other associations. Preachers are God-called (not trained by man), unpaid, and preach improvisational (often chanted) sermons. Baptism (in running water), the Lord&#x27;s supper and feet washing are held to be ordinances. Shouting is a frequent occurrence at an Old Regular meeting, particularly among the female membership. Conversion experiences may be a lengthy process, beginning with an awakening to sin, through a period of conviction and travail of the soul, to repentance and belief.

==Lined-out hymnody==
One feature of worship that has garnered much attention for the Old Regular Baptists is their lined-out, non-instrumental, congregational hymnody. According to Jeff Titon, &quot;The leader sings the very first line, and the congregation joins in when they recognize the song. After that, the song proceeds line by line: the leader briefly chants a line alone, and then the group repeats the words but to a tune that is much longer and more elaborate than the leader&#x27;s chant or lining tune.&quot; E. D. Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot; (1877) and Edward W. Billups&#x27; &quot;The Sweet Songster&quot; (1854) are two of several &quot;words-only&quot; hymn books preferred by these churches, with the tunes taught aurally. The practice of lining out psalms and hymns was once common across Britain and America, but in the British Isles, but the only remaining vestige of the tradition can be found in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, where it is done in Gaelic.

Smithsonian Folkways recorded the Indian Bottom Association of Old Regular Baptists for a 1997 album called &quot;Old Regular Baptists: Lined-Out Hymnody from Southeastern Kentucky.&quot; This same congregation also provided lined-out singing for the soundtrack to the 2019 film &quot;The Mountain Minor&quot;.

==Current status==

The majority of Old Regular Baptists are in Appalachia, particularly along the Kentucky-Virginia border, although Old Regular Baptist churches exist as far north as Michigan and as far south as Florida, and several churches still exist in the state of Washington. Currently, there are seven local associations in the New Salem correspondence: New Salem, Northern New Salem, Old Friendship, Old Indian Bottom, Philadelphia, Sardis, and Union. The Indian Bottom, Sovereign Grace, Mountain #1 and Mountain #2 Friendship, and Bethel are independent bodies no longer associated with the New Salem cluster. These 14 associations and independent churches (not lettered to an association) amount to over 350 churches with over 6,000 members. The folk singer Jean Ritchie was a member of the Old Regular Baptists in Kentucky.

<doc id="331512" wikidata="Q1126309" url="?curid=331512" title="Mealy machine">
<text>In the theory of computation, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. This is in contrast to a Moore machine, whose output values are determined solely by its current state. A Mealy machine is a deterministic finite-state transducer: for each state and input, at most one transition is possible.

==History==
The Mealy machine is named after George H. Mealy, who presented the concept in a 1955 paper, &quot;A Method for Synthesizing Sequential Circuits&quot;.

==Formal definition==
A Mealy machine is a 6-tuple formula_1 consisting of the following:
* a finite set of states formula_2
* a start state (also called initial state) formula_3 which is an element of formula_2
* a finite set called the input alphabet formula_5
* a finite set called the output alphabet formula_6
* a transition function formula_7 mapping pairs of a state and an input symbol to the corresponding next state.
* an output function formula_8 mapping pairs of a state and an input symbol to the corresponding output symbol.

In some formulations, the transition and output functions are coalesced into a single function formula_9.

&quot;Evolution across time&quot; is realized in this abstraction by having the state machine consult the time-changing input symbol at discrete &quot;timer ticks&quot; formula_10 and react according to its internal configuration at those idealized instants, or else having the state machine wait for a next input symbol (as on a FIFO) and react whenever it arrives.

==Comparison of Mealy machines and Moore machines==
# Mealy machines tend to have fewer states:
#* Different outputs on arcs (&quot;n&quot;2) rather than states (&quot;n&quot;).
# When implemented as electronic circuits (rather than as mathematical abstractions or code):
#* Moore machines are safer to use than Mealy machines:
#** Outputs change at the clock edge (always one cycle later).
#** In Mealy machines, input change can cause output change as soon as logic is done — a big problem when two machines are interconnected – asynchronous feedback may occur if one isn&#x27;t careful.
#* Mealy machines react faster to inputs:
#** React in the same cycle—they don&#x27;t need to wait for the clock.
#** In Moore machines, more logic may be necessary to decode state into outputs—more gate delays after clock edge.

==Diagram==
The state diagram for a Mealy machine associates an output value with each transition edge, in contrast to the state diagram for a Moore machine, which associates an output value with each state.

When the input and output alphabet are both , one can also associate to a Mealy automata a Helix directed graph . This graph has as vertices the couples of state and letters, each node is of out-degree one, and the successor of is the next state of the automata and the letter that the automata output when it is instate and it reads letter . This graph is a union of disjoint cycles if the automaton is bireversible.

==Examples==

===Simple ===

A simple Mealy machine has one input and one output. Each transition edge is labeled with the value of the input (shown in red) and the value of the output (shown in blue). The machine starts in state . (In this example, the output is the exclusive-or of the two most-recent input values; thus, the machine implements an edge detector, outputting a 1 every time the input flips and a 0 otherwise.)

=== Complex ===
More complex Mealy machines can have multiple inputs as well as multiple outputs.

==Applications==
Mealy machines provide a rudimentary mathematical model for cipher machines. Considering the input and output alphabet the Latin alphabet, for example, then a Mealy machine can be designed that given a string of letters (a sequence of inputs) can process it into a ciphered string (a sequence of outputs). However, although a Mealy model could be used to describe the Enigma, the state diagram would be too complex to provide feasible means of designing complex ciphering machines.

Moore/Mealy machines are DFAs that have also output at any tick of the clock. Modern CPUs, computers, cell phones, digital clocks and basic electronic devices/machines have some kind of finite state machine to control it.

Simple software systems, particularly ones that can be represented using regular expressions, can be modeled as finite state machines. There are many such simple systems, such as vending machines or basic electronics.

By finding the intersection of two finite state machines, one can design in a very simple manner concurrent systems that exchange messages for instance. For example, a traffic light is a system that consists of multiple subsystems, such as the different traffic lights, that work concurrently.

Some examples of applications:
*number classification
*watch with timer
*vending machine
*traffic light
*barcode scanner
*gas pumps

<text>A message picture (or message movie) is a motion picture that, in addition to or instead of being for entertainment, intends to communicate a certain message or ideal about society.

==Characteristics==
Message pictures usually present the message they want to deliver in the form of a morality play, and are usually serious (often somber) works. However, not all message pictures are entirely serious, and there are also films spoofing the genre (&quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, for example).

==History==
Dore Schary was famous for his message pictures at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the late 1940s and early to mid-1950s. Among these were &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, and &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;. Other famous message pictures by other parties include &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (the former directed by Stanley Kramer, who was also well known for numerous message films).

In Indian cinema, B.R. Chopra was known for message pictures. Examples include &quot;Kanoon&quot; (against capital punishment), &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (importance of labour), &quot;Waqt&quot; (importance of time and destiny), &quot;Nikaah&quot; (against triple talaq (divorce) among Muslims), etc.

<text>&quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; is a novelette in the &quot;Robot&quot; series by American writer Isaac Asimov. According to the foreword in &quot;Robot Visions&quot;, Asimov was approached to write a story, along with a number of other authors who would do the same, for a science fiction collection to be published in honor of the United States Bicentennial. However, the arrangement fell through, leaving Asimov&#x27;s the only story actually completed for the project. Asimov sold the story to Judy-Lynn del Rey, who made some small changes to the text. Asimov restored the original text when the story was collected in &quot;The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories&quot; (1976).

The story formed the basis of the novel &quot;The Positronic Man&quot; (1992), co-written with Robert Silverberg, and the 1999 film &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, starring Robin Williams.

In terms of setting, this novelette spans a time period of 200 years. Chapter 13 of the novelette states that &quot;Susan Calvin, the patron saint of all roboticists&quot; had been dead for &quot;nearly two centuries&quot;. According to &quot;I, Robot&quot;, Susan Calvin was born in the year 1982 and died at the age of 82, either in 2064 or 2065. This suggests that the earliest events of the story took place somewhere between the 2050s and early 2060s.

==Plot==
A character named Andrew Martin requests an unknown operation from a robotic surgeon. However, the robot refuses, as the operation is harmful and violates the First Law of Robotics, which says a robot may never harm a human being. Andrew changes its mind, telling it that he is not a human being.

The story jumps to 200 years in the past, when a robot with a serial number beginning with &quot;NDR&quot; is brought to the home of Gerald Martin (referred to as Sir) as a robot butler. Little Miss (Sir&#x27;s daughter) names him Andrew. Later, Little Miss asks Andrew to carve a pendant out of wood. She shows it to her father, who initially does not believe a robot could carve so skillfully. Sir has Andrew carve more things, and even read books on woodwork. Andrew uses, for the first time, the word &quot;enjoy&quot; to describe why he carves. Sir takes Andrew to U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Inc. to ask what the source of his creativity is, but they have no good explanation.

Sir helps Andrew to sell his products, taking half the profits and putting the other half in a bank account in the name of Andrew Martin (though there is questionable legality to a robot owning a bank account). Andrew uses the money to pay for bodily upgrades, keeping himself in perfect shape, but never has his positronic brain altered. Sir reveals that U.S. Robots has ended a study on generalized pathways and creative robots, frightened by Andrew&#x27;s unpredictability.

Little Miss, at this point, is married and has a child, Little Sir. Andrew, feeling Sir now has someone to replace his grown-up children, asks to purchase his own freedom with Little Miss&#x27;s support. Sir is apprehensive, fearing that freeing Andrew legally would require bringing attention to Andrew&#x27;s bank account, and might result in the loss of all Andrew&#x27;s money, but he agrees to attempt it. Though facing initial resistance, Andrew wins his freedom. Sir refuses to let Andrew pay him. It isn&#x27;t long afterwards that he falls ill, and dies after asking Andrew to stand by his deathbed.

Andrew begins to wear clothes, and Little Sir (who orders Andrew to call him George) is a lawyer. He insists on dressing like a human, even though most humans refuse to accept him. In a conversation with George, Andrew realizes he must also expand his vocabulary, and decides to go to the library. On his way, he gets lost, and stands in the middle of a field. Two humans begin to walk across the field towards him, and he asks them the way to the library. They instead harass him, and threaten to take him apart when George arrives and scares them off. As he takes Andrew to the library, Andrew explains that he wants to write a book on the history of robots. The incident with the two humans angers Little Miss, and she forces George to go to court for robot rights. George&#x27;s son, Paul, helps out by fighting the legal battle as George convinces the public. Eventually, the public opinion is turned in favor of robots, and laws are passed banning robot-harming orders. Little Miss, after the court case is won, dies.

Andrew, with Paul&#x27;s help, gets a meeting with the head of U.S. Robots. He requests that his body be replaced by an android, so that he may better resemble a human. After Paul threatens legal action, U.S. Robots agrees to give Andrew an android body. However, U.S. Robots retaliates by creating central brains for their robots, so that no individual robot may become like Andrew. Meanwhile, Andrew, with his new body, decides to study robobiology – the science of organic robots like himself. Andrew begins to design a system allowing androids to eat food like humans, solely for the purpose of becoming more like a person.

After Paul&#x27;s death, Andrew comes to U.S. Robots again, meeting with Alvin Magdescu, Director of Research. He offers U.S. Robots the opportunity to market his newly designed prostheses for human use, as well as his own. He successfully has the digestive system installed in his body, and plans to create an excretory system to match. Meanwhile, his products are successfully marketed and he becomes a highly honored inventor. As he reaches 150 years of age, a dinner is held in his honor in which he is labeled the Sesquicentennial Robot. Andrew is not yet satisfied, however.

Andrew decides that he wants to be a man. He obtains the backing of Feingold and Martin (the law firm of George and Paul) and seeks out Li-Hsing, a legislator and chairman of the Science and Technology committee, hoping that the World Legislature will declare him a human being. Li-Hsing advises him that it will be a long legal battle, but he says he is willing to fight for it. Feingold and Martin begins to slowly bring cases to court that generalize what it means to be human, hoping that despite his prosthetics, Andrew can be regarded as essentially human. Most legislators are still hesitant due to his immortality.

The first scene of the story is explained as Andrew seeks out a robotic surgeon to perform an ultimately fatal operation: altering his positronic brain so that it will decay with time. He has the operation arranged so that he will live to be 200. When he goes before the World Legislature, he reveals his sacrifice, moving them to declare him a man. The World President signs the law on Andrew&#x27;s two-hundredth birthday, declaring him a bicentennial man. As Andrew lies on his deathbed, he tries to hold onto the thought of his humanity, but as his consciousness fades his last thought is of Little Miss. 

==&quot;Foundation&quot; universe==
This story is retro-set within Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe, which also includes his earlier Susan Calvin positronic robot tales. It is clearly set centuries prior to the events of his novella &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and the novel &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, during a period in which the Spacer worlds have yet to turn against the people of the Earth, and in which the U.S. Robots corporation is still active.

In &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, Dr. Han Fastolfe refers to Andrew Martin as a robot that was supposed to have undergone &quot;gradual humanization&quot;, but states that such a thing would have been impossible, because the shape of the body dictates the state of the mind.

== Awards ==
&quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; was awarded the Hugo Award best science fiction novelette of 1976. It was awarded the Nebula Award for best science fiction novelette after Ursula K. Le Guin refused the award for her novelette &quot;The Diary of the Rose&quot; in protest of the Science Fiction Writers of America&#x27;s political intolerance in revoking Stanisław Lem&#x27;s membership.

== Adaptations ==
* &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999), film directed by Chris Columbus, based on novelette &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; and on novel &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;

<doc id="331535" wikidata="Q863908" url="?curid=331535" title="Nucleic acid sequence">
<text>A nucleic acid sequence is a succession of bases within the nucleotides forming alleles within a DNA (using GACT) or RNA (GACU) molecule. This succession is denoted by a series of a set of five different letters that indicate the order of the nucleotides. By convention, sequences are usually presented from the 5&#x27; end to the 3&#x27; end. For DNA, with its double helix, there are two possible directions for the notated sequence; of these two, the sense strand is used. Because nucleic acids are normally linear (unbranched) polymers, specifying the sequence is equivalent to defining the covalent structure of the entire molecule. For this reason, the nucleic acid sequence is also termed the primary structure.

The sequence represents genetic information. Biological deoxyribonucleic acid represents the information which directs the functions of an organism.

Nucleic acids also have a secondary structure and tertiary structure. Primary structure is sometimes mistakenly referred to as &quot;primary sequence&quot;. However there is no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.

== Nucleotides ==


Nucleic acids consist of a chain of linked units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three subunits: a phosphate group and a sugar (ribose in the case of RNA, deoxyribose in DNA) make up the backbone of the nucleic acid strand, and attached to the sugar is one of a set of nucleobases. The nucleobases are important in base pairing of strands to form higher-level secondary and tertiary structures such as the famed double helix.

The possible letters are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;T&quot;, representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand – adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine – covalently linked to a phosphodiester backbone. In the typical case, the sequences are printed abutting one another without gaps, as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC, read left to right in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. With regards to transcription, a sequence is on the coding strand if it has the same order as the transcribed RNA.

One sequence can be complementary to another sequence, meaning that they have the base on each position in the complementary (i.e., A to T, C to G) and in the reverse order. For example, the complementary sequence to TTAC is GTAA. If one strand of the double-stranded DNA is considered the sense strand, then the other strand, considered the antisense strand, will have the complementary sequence to the sense strand.

=== Notation ===
While A, T, C, and G represent a particular nucleotide at a position, there are also letters that represent ambiguity which are used when more than one kind of nucleotide could occur at that position. The rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) are as follows:

For example, W means that either an adenine or a thymine could occur in that position without impairing the sequence&#x27;s functionality.

These symbols are also valid for RNA, except with U (uracil) replacing T (thymine).

Apart from adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and uracil (U), DNA and RNA also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been formed. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytidine (m5C). In RNA, there are many modified bases, including pseudouridine (Ψ), dihydrouridine (D), inosine (I), ribothymidine (rT) and 7-methylguanosine (m7G). Hypoxanthine and xanthine are two of the many bases created through mutagen presence, both of them through deamination (replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group). Hypoxanthine is produced from adenine, and xanthine is produced from guanine. Similarly, deamination of cytosine results in uracil.

;Example of comparing and determining the % difference between two nucleotide sequences
* AATCCGCTAG
* AAACCCTTAG

Given the two 10-nucleotide sequences, line them up and compare the differences between them. Calculate the percent difference by taking the number of differences between the DNA bases divided by the total number of nucleotides. In this case there are three differences in the 10 nucleotide sequence. Thus there is a 30% difference.

== Biological significance ==


In biological systems, nucleic acids contain information which is used by a living cell to construct specific proteins. The sequence of nucleobases on a nucleic acid strand is translated by cell machinery into a sequence of amino acids making up a protein strand. Each group of three bases, called a codon, corresponds to a single amino acid, and there is a specific genetic code by which each possible combination of three bases corresponds to a specific amino acid.

The central dogma of molecular biology outlines the mechanism by which proteins are constructed using information contained in nucleic acids. DNA is transcribed into mRNA molecules, which travel to the ribosome where the mRNA is used as a template for the construction of the protein strand. Since nucleic acids can bind to molecules with complementary sequences, there is a distinction between &quot;sense&quot; sequences which code for proteins, and the complementary &quot;antisense&quot; sequence, which is by itself nonfunctional, but can bind to the sense strand.

== Sequence determination ==


DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleotide sequence of a given DNA fragment. The sequence of the DNA of a living thing encodes the necessary information for that living thing to survive and reproduce. Therefore, determining the sequence is useful in fundamental research into why and how organisms live, as well as in applied subjects. Because of the importance of DNA to living things, knowledge of a DNA sequence may be useful in practically any biological research. For example, in medicine it can be used to identify, diagnose and potentially develop treatments for genetic diseases. Similarly, research into pathogens may lead to treatments for contagious diseases. Biotechnology is a burgeoning discipline, with the potential for many useful products and services.

RNA is not sequenced directly. Instead, it is copied to a DNA by reverse transcriptase, and this DNA is then sequenced.

Current sequencing methods rely on the discriminatory ability of DNA polymerases, and therefore can only distinguish four bases. An inosine (created from adenosine during RNA editing) is read as a G, and 5-methyl-cytosine (created from cytosine by DNA methylation) is read as a C. With current technology, it is difficult to sequence small amounts of DNA, as the signal is too weak to measure. This is overcome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.

=== Digital representation ===

Once a nucleic acid sequence has been obtained from an organism, it is stored &quot;in silico&quot; in digital format. Digital genetic sequences may be stored in sequence databases, be analyzed (see &quot;Sequence analysis&quot; below), be digitally altered and be used as templates for creating new actual DNA using artificial gene synthesis.

== Sequence analysis ==
Digital genetic sequences may be analyzed using the tools of bioinformatics to attempt to determine its function.

=== Genetic testing ===
The DNA in an organism&#x27;s genome can be analyzed to diagnose vulnerabilities to inherited diseases, and can also be used to determine a child&#x27;s paternity (genetic father) or a person&#x27;s ancestry. Normally, every person carries two variations of every gene, one inherited from their mother, the other inherited from their father. The human genome is believed to contain around 20,000–25,000 genes. In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.

Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. Usually, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person&#x27;s chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.

=== Sequence alignment ===
In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be due to functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. If two sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor, mismatches can be interpreted as point mutations and gaps as insertion or deletion mutations (indels) introduced in one or both lineages in the time since they diverged from one another. In sequence alignments of proteins, the degree of similarity between amino acids occupying a particular position in the sequence can be interpreted as a rough measure of how conserved a particular region or sequence motif is among lineages. The absence of substitutions, or the presence of only very conservative substitutions (that is, the substitution of amino acids whose side chains have similar biochemical properties) in a particular region of the sequence, suggest that this region has structural or functional importance. Although DNA and RNA nucleotide bases are more similar to each other than are amino acids, the conservation of base pairs can indicate a similar functional or structural role.

Computational phylogenetics makes extensive use of sequence alignments in the construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous genes represented in the genomes of divergent species. The degree to which sequences in a query set differ is qualitatively related to the sequences&#x27; evolutionary distance from one another. Roughly speaking, high sequence identity suggests that the sequences in question have a comparatively young most recent common ancestor, while low identity suggests that the divergence is more ancient. This approximation, which reflects the &quot;molecular clock&quot; hypothesis that a roughly constant rate of evolutionary change can be used to extrapolate the elapsed time since two genes first diverged (that is, the coalescence time), assumes that the effects of mutation and selection are constant across sequence lineages. Therefore, it does not account for possible differences among organisms or species in the rates of DNA repair or the possible functional conservation of specific regions in a sequence. (In the case of nucleotide sequences, the molecular clock hypothesis in its most basic form also discounts the difference in acceptance rates between silent mutations that do not alter the meaning of a given codon and other mutations that result in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein.) More statistically accurate methods allow the evolutionary rate on each branch of the phylogenetic tree to vary, thus producing better estimates of coalescence times for genes.

=== Sequence motifs ===
Frequently the primary structure encodes motifs that are of functional importance. Some examples of sequence motifs are: the C/D
and H/ACA boxes
of snoRNAs, Sm binding site found in spliceosomal RNAs such as U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, U12 and U3, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence,
the Kozak consensus sequence
and the RNA polymerase III terminator.

=== Sequence entropy ===

In bioinformatics, a sequence entropy, also known as sequence complexity or information profile, is a numerical sequence providing a quantitative measure of the local complexity of a DNA sequence, independently of the direction of processing. The manipulations of the information profiles enable the analysis of the sequences using alignment-free techniques, such as for example in motif and rearrangements detection.

<doc id="331538" wikidata="Q240623" url="?curid=331538" title="Anita Bryant">
<text>Anita Jane Bryant (March 25, 1940 – December 16, 2024) was an American singer and a Christian activist against gay rights in the United States. She had three top 20 hits in the United States in the early 1960s. She was the 1958 Miss Oklahoma beauty pageant winner, and a brand ambassador for the Florida Citrus Commission from 1969 to 1980.

From 1977 to 1980, Bryant was an outspoken Christian opponent of gay rights in the United States. In 1977, she ran the Save Our Children campaign to repeal a local ordinance in Miami-Dade County, Florida, that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Throughout the country, supporters of gay rights condemned Bryant for her campaign. Assisted by prominent figures in music, film, and television, they retaliated by boycotting the orange juice that she promoted. The campaign ended on June 7, 1977 with a 69% majority vote to repeal the ordinance (which Dade County restored in 1998). Though this was a victory for Bryant, her public image was irreparably damaged and she found herself blacklisted. Her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was terminated three years later. This, as well as her later divorce from Bob Green, left her financially insolvent and she filed for bankruptcy twice.

==Early life==
Bryant was born in Barnsdall, Oklahoma, on March 25, 1940, the daughter of Lenora Annice Berry and Warren G. Bryant. After her parents divorced, her father went into the U.S. Army and her mother went to work as a clerk for Tinker Air Force Base. She began singing at the age of 2 at the First Baptist church in Barnsdall, with &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;. She was singing onstage at the age of six, at local fairgrounds in Oklahoma. She sang occasionally on radio and television, and was invited to audition when Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s talent show came to town, eventually winning the contest. At age 12, she had her television show &quot;The Anita Bryant Show&quot;, which aired on WKY (now KFOR-TV).

Bryant became Miss Oklahoma in 1958, right after graduating from Tulsa&#x27;s Will Rogers High School, and was second runner-up in the 1959 Miss America pageant (held September 6, 1958) at age 18.

In 1960, Bryant married Bob Green (1931–2012), a Miami disc jockey, with whom she eventually raised four children. They divorced in 1980.

==Career==
Bryant appeared early in her career on the NBC interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; and on the same network&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show&quot;, starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.

Bryant released several albums on the Carlton and Columbia labels. Her first album, &quot;Anita Bryant&quot;, which was released in 1959, contained &quot;Till There Was You&quot; and songs from other Broadway shows. Her second album, &quot;Hear Anita Bryant in Your Home Tonight&quot; (1961), contains &quot;Paper Roses&quot; and &quot;Wonderland by Night&quot;, as well as several songs that first appeared in her singles. Her third album, &quot;In My Little Corner of the World&quot;, also in 1961, contains the title song and other songs that have to do with places around the world, including &quot;Canadian Sunset&quot; and &quot;I Love Paris&quot;. Bryant&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1963), contains both her original Carlton hits (because Columbia purchased all the masters from Carlton) plus sides from her Columbia recordings, including &quot;Paper Roses&quot; and &quot;Step by Step, Little by Little&quot;. In 1964, she released &quot;The World of Lonely People&quot;, containing, in addition to the title song, &quot;Welcome, Welcome Home&quot; and a new rendition of &quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot;, arranged by Frank Hunter. Bryant also released several albums of religious music.

Bryant had a moderate pop hit with the song &quot;Till There Was You&quot; (1959, US No. 30), from the Broadway production &quot;The Music Man&quot;. She also had three hits that reached the Top 20 in the U.S.: &quot;Paper Roses&quot; (1960, US No. 5, and covered by Marie Osmond 13 years later), &quot;In My Little Corner of the World&quot; (1960, US No. 10), and &quot;Wonderland by Night&quot; (1961, US No. 18), originally a hit for Bert Kaempfert. &quot;Paper Roses&quot;, &quot;In My Little Corner of the World&quot;, and &quot;Till There Was You&quot;, each sold over one million copies, and were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.
From 1961 until 1968, Bryant frequently joined Bob Hope on holiday tours for the United Service Organizations. She again traveled with Hope for televised shows during the Vietnam War. Bryant was given the Silver Medallion Award from the National Guard for &quot;outstanding service by an entertainer&quot;, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Leadership Gold Medallion.

Between 1964 and 1969, Bryant performed at multiple White House functions, including both the Democratic Convention in Chicago and the Miami Republican Convention in 1968. She was nominated for two Grammy Awards: best sacred performance and best spiritual performance. 

In 1967, with &quot;I Believe&quot; she moved towards gospel which would also characterize the music of her other albums.

In 1969, Bryant became a spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, and nationally televised commercials featured her singing &quot;Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree&quot; and stating the commercials&#x27; tagline: &quot;Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.&quot; (Later, the slogan became, &quot;It isn&#x27;t just for breakfast anymore!&quot;) In addition during that time, she appeared in advertisements for Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Holiday Inn, and Tupperware. In the 1970s, Bryant was teamed up with the Disney Character &quot;Orange Bird&quot;, with whom she appeared in several orange juice commercials. She also sang the Orange Bird Song and narrated the Orange Bird record album, with music written by the Sherman Brothers. She also published her cookbook, Bless This Food: The Anita Bryant Family Cookbook, described as &quot;Much more than a cookbook, this is the story of a family devoted to Christ.&quot;

Bryant sang &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; during the half-time show of Super Bowl V in 1971, and at the graveside services for President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973. She also co-hosted the televised segment of the Orange Bowl Parade for nine years.

Bryant hosted a two-hour television special, &quot;The Anita Bryant Spectacular&quot;, in March 1980. She recounted her autobiography, appeared in medleys of prerecorded songs, and interviewed Pat Boone. The West Point Glee Club and General William Westmoreland participated.

==Anti-gay rights activism==

In 1977, Dade County, Florida, passed an ordinance sponsored by Bryant&#x27;s former friend Ruth Shack that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Bryant led a highly publicized campaign to repeal the ordinance, as the leader of a coalition named Save Our Children. The singer was especially concerned about the fact that the ordinance risked authorizing homosexual people to work in Christian schools and become role-models, because her own children were enrolled there. The campaign was based on conservative Christian beliefs regarding the sinfulness of homosexuality and the proposed threat of homosexual recruitment of children and child molestation. Bryant stated:

She also perpetuated the idea of the gay community &#x27;recruiting&#x27; children through child abuse to become homosexual themselves. When Shack and other leaders refused to vote in opposition to the ordinance as per her request, she pleaded with families directly &quot;The recruitment of our children is absolutely necessary for the survival and growth of homosexuality... for since homosexuals cannot reproduce, they must recruit, must freshen their ranks.&quot;

The campaign marked the beginning of an organized opposition to gay rights that spread across the nation. Jerry Falwell went to Miami to help Bryant. She made the following statements during the campaign: &quot;As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children&quot; and &quot;If gays are granted rights, next we&#x27;ll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters.&quot; She also said, &quot;All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God&#x27;s continued help we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation.&quot;

The name of the campaign had to be changed to &quot;Protect America&#x27;s Children&quot; because of legal action by the Save the Children foundation.

===Victory and defeat===
On June 7, 1977, Bryant&#x27;s campaign led to a repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the success of Bryant&#x27;s campaign galvanized her opponents, and the gay community retaliated against her by forming the Coalition for Human Rights and the Miami Victory Campaign, who organized a boycott of orange juice. Gay bars all over North America stopped serving screwdrivers and replaced them with the &quot;Anita Bryant Cocktail&quot;, which was made with vodka and apple juice. Additionally, merchandise such as buttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts with slogans like &quot;A day without human rights is like a day without sunshine&quot; were sold to push the anti-discrimination movement further. Sales and proceeds went to gay rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.

In 1977, Florida legislators approved a measure prohibiting gay adoption. The ban was overturned more than 30 years later when, on November 25, 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared it unconstitutional.

On October 14, 1977, during a televised appearance in Des Moines, Iowa, she repeatedly said she &quot;loves homosexuals, but hates their sin&quot;. During this appearance, Bryant became one of the first people to be publicly &quot;pied&quot; as part of a political protest. She had a pie thrown at her by Thom L. Higgins (1950–1994). Bryant quipped &quot;At least it&#x27;s a fruit pie&quot;, making a pun on the derogatory slur of &quot;fruit&quot; for a gay man and a reference to her work as a sponsor for fruit companies. While covered in pie after the assault, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist &quot;for his deviant lifestyle&quot; before bursting into tears as the cameras continued rolling. Bryant&#x27;s husband said that he would not retaliate, but followed the protesters outside and threw a pie at them. By this time, gay activists ensured that the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities, including Jane Fonda, Paul Williams, and Vincent Price (he joked in a television interview that Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; referred to her). Johnny Carson also made Bryant a regular target of ridicule in his nightly monologues. In 1978, Bryant and Bob Green told the story of their campaign in the book &quot;At Any Cost&quot;. The gay community continued to regard Bryant&#x27;s name as synonymous with bigotry and homophobia. However, at the same time, her name became a call to action for gay rights activists, and motivated many to picket her events, host anti-Bryant protests across the country, and increase attendance in and frequency of pride marches.

Bryant led several more campaigns around the country to repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances, including campaigns in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon. In 1978, her success led to the Briggs Initiative in California, which would have made pro-gay statements regarding homosexual people or homosexuality by any public school employee cause for dismissal. Grassroots liberal organizations, chiefly in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, organized to defeat the initiative. Days before the election, the California Democratic Party opposed the proposed legislation. President Jimmy Carter, Governor Jerry Brown, former president Gerald Ford, and former governor (and future President) Ronald Reagan—then planning a run for the presidency—all voiced opposition to the initiative, and it ultimately suffered a massive defeat at the polls.

In 1998, the Miami-Dade County Commission reinstated the ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, by a narrow 7–6 vote. In 2002, a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law, called Amendment 14, was voted down by 56 percent of the voters. The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal appellate court against a constitutional challenge but was overturned by a Miami-Dade circuit court in November 2008.

==Career decline and bankruptcies==
The fallout from Bryant&#x27;s political activism caused irreparable damage to her business and entertainment career, with her obituary in &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; framing her 1978 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview as a turning point in her career. Even earlier in February 1977, the Singer Corporation rescinded an offer to sponsor an upcoming weekly variety show because of the &quot;extensive national publicity arising from [Bryant&#x27;s] controversial political activities.&quot;

In 1978, while a member of a Baptist church, she ran for vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention, but lost. Several leaders disagreed with how she rejected civil rights for gay people.

Bryant&#x27;s marriage to Bob Green also failed at that time; she divorced him in 1980, citing emotional abuse and latent suicidal thoughts. Green refused to accept this, claiming his fundamentalist religious beliefs did not recognize civil divorce and that &quot;in God&#x27;s eyes&quot;, she was still his wife.

Many Christian fundamentalist audiences and venues shunned Bryant after her divorce. Because she was no longer invited to appear at their events, she lost a major source of income. The Florida Citrus Commission also allowed her contract to lapse after the divorce, stating that Bryant was now &quot;worn out&quot; as a spokesperson.

Bryant rapidly became the butt of jokes, as her image shifted from being a model Christian spokeswoman to that of a priggish, self-righteous bigot. The decline of her reputation was aided by &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson, and other comedians and talk-show hosts as they regularly mocked her to the general public. This led to her endorsements being cancelled and sponsors dropping her, as she was now viewed as a liability.

Bryant and three of her four children moved from Miami to Selma, Alabama and later to Atlanta, Georgia. In a 1980 &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; article she said, &quot;The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women&#x27;s problems.&quot; She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage. Bryant also commented on her somewhat relaxed anti-gay views, saying &quot;I&#x27;m more inclined to say live and let live, just don&#x27;t flaunt it or try to legalize it.&quot; In a 2012 interview, her son Robert Green, Jr. said &quot;she would be putting a lot more energy into fighting gay rights if she still felt as strongly.&quot;

Bryant appeared in Michael Moore&#x27;s 1989 documentary film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, in which she is interviewed and travels to Flint, Michigan, as part of the effort to help revitalize its devastated local economy.

Bryant married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990. The couple tried to reestablish her music career in a series of small venues, including Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where they opened Anita Bryant&#x27;s Music Mansion. The establishment combined Bryant&#x27;s performances of her successful songs from early in her career with a &quot;lengthy segment in which she preached her Christian beliefs&quot;. The venture was not successful and the Music Mansion, which had missed meeting payrolls at times, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 with Bryant and Dry leaving several employees and creditors unpaid. They remained married until his death in April 2024, eight months before Bryant&#x27;s death.

Bryant also spent part of the 1990s in Branson, Missouri, where the state and federal governments both filed liens claiming more than $116,000 in unpaid taxes. Bryant and Dry had also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Arkansas in 1997 after piling up bills from a failed Anita Bryant show in Eureka Springs; among the debts were more than in unpaid state and federal taxes.

In 1996, Bryant stated that she was happy to no longer be working in show business.

== Later life and death ==
In 2005, Bryant returned to Barnsdall to attend the town&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration and to have a street renamed in her honor. In 2006, she founded Anita Bryant Ministries International in Oklahoma City. In 2011, she defended her anti-gay activism saying &quot;I did the right thing&quot; and &quot;I never regretted what I did.&quot;

In 2021, Bryant&#x27;s granddaughter came out publicly on an episode of Slate&#x27;s &quot;One Year&quot; podcast series by announcing her pending marriage to a woman, although she was having difficulty deciding whether she should invite her grandmother to the ceremony.

Bryant died from cancer at her home in Edmond, Oklahoma, on December 16, 2024, at the age of 84. Her death was announced by her family on January 9, 2025.

==In popular culture==
Bryant is a frequently portrayed character at drag shows across the United States.

=== Music ===
Bryant&#x27;s name has frequently been invoked as a prototypical example of opposition to LGBT rights. When Elton John was criticized for touring Russia in 1979, he responded: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I won&#x27;t tour in America because I can&#x27;t stand Anita Bryant&quot;. In his song &quot;Mañana&quot;, Jimmy Buffett sings &quot;I hope Anita Bryant never ever does one of my songs&quot;. In 1978, David Allan Coe recorded the song &quot;Fuck Aneta Briant&quot; on his album &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;. California punk rock band Dead Kennedys referenced Bryant in their song &quot;Moral Majority&quot; from their 1981 EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot;

In 1977, the Dutch &quot;levenslied&quot; singer Zangeres Zonder Naam wrote the protest song &quot;Luister Anita&quot; (&quot;Listen Up, Anita&quot;) on the occasion of the protest night &quot;Miami Nightmare&quot;, organized in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. The nightly concert was intended to raise funds for an advertisement in &quot;Time&quot;, in which the Dutch nation was to call on the American people to protect the rights of minorities. In the song, Zangeres Zonder Naam compared Anita Bryant to Hitler and called on gays to fight for their rights. The song became an integral part of her repertoire and cemented her status as a cult figure among Dutch gays.
=== Literature ===
Steve Gerber, in his &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; for Marvel Comics, made an organization called the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) who were led by Anita Bryant. Although it was not explicitly stated, even &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the implication &quot;transparent&quot;.

Armistead Maupin, in his 1980 novel &quot;More Tales of the City&quot;, used Anita Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign to prompt a principal character to come out of the closet.

=== Screen ===
Bryant was regularly lampooned on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, sometimes with her politics as the target, sometimes her reputation as a popular, traditional entertainer known for her commercials as the target, and sometimes targeting a combination of the two. Her name was also a frequent punchline on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, such as the time host/producer Chuck Barris joked that Bryant was releasing a new Christmas album called &quot;Gay Tidings&quot;. Some references were less overtly political, but equally critical. In the film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), Leslie Nielsen&#x27;s character, upon seeing a large number of passengers become violently ill, vomit, and have uncontrollable flatulence, remarked: &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this since the Anita Bryant concert.&quot; Other television shows that targeted her were &quot;Soap&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. She was also the target of mockery in the RiffTrax short &quot;Drugs Are Like That&quot;.

Bryant appears in archive footage as a principal antagonist in the 2008 American biographical film &quot;Milk,&quot; about the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. She was also portrayed as the principal antagonist in the 2011 play, &quot;Anita Bryant Died for Your Sins.&quot;

In May 2013, producers announced plans for a biographical HBO film based on Bryant&#x27;s life to star Uma Thurman, with a script from gay screenwriter Chad Hodge. Long languishing in development, as of 2019, Ashley Judd and Neil Patrick Harris have been attached to the project.

Archive footage of Bryant appears in &quot;The Gospel of Eureka&quot;, a 2018 documentary about the lives of LGBT individuals and evangelical Christians in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

=== Stage ===
Bryant was lampooned in the 2016 play &quot;Anita Bryant&#x27;s Playboy Interview&quot;, based on her 1978 magazine piece.

She is also the subject of &quot;The Loneliest Girl in the World&quot;, a musical that premiered at Diversionary Theatre in San Diego in mid-2018.

==Writing==
Mark D. Jordan has written: &quot;Many of her public statements, including her books, were ghostwritten by others, and there is internal reason to conclude that the most political books were pasted together by several hands from various sources.&quot;

<text>Battleford (2021 population 4,400) is a town located across the North Saskatchewan River from the city of North Battleford, in Saskatchewan, Canada.

Battleford and North Battleford are collectively referred to as &quot;the Battlefords&quot;. Although there has been occasional talk of the two communities merging, they remain separate entities. The local economy is fuelled mainly by agriculture.

==History==

The Battleford area, dating from the 1770s, was the site of fur trading houses of numerous independent companies as well as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (that opened its Battleford, or Battle River post circa 1868). William Holmes operated a trading post for the North West Company just above the confluence of the Battle and Saskatchewan rivers in 1784. At least three posts were in use between 1868 and 1914.

The town itself was founded in 1875 as a fur trading post and North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) fort. Its post office opened in 1877. Between 1876 and 1883, Battleford was the territorial capital of the North-West Territories (now Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nunavut, northern Quebec, northern Ontario and the Northwest Territories) and the NWMP fort (Fort Battleford) located there played an important role in the 1885 North-West Rebellion. It is also the terminus of the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail.

In 1883, the Battleford Industrial School opened. A residential school for First Nations children in Battleford, it operated from 1883 to 1914. It was the first residential school operated by the Government of Canada with the aim of assimilating Indigenous people into the society of the settlers. The school was one of three industrial schools opened by the Government of Canada in the early 1880s. The senior officials of the Department of Indian Affairs arranged for various religious denominations to administer and operate the schools. The federal government delegated responsibility for the Battleford school to an Anglican minister.

In 1888, the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in the area. In 1892, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened a new store in Battleford, which closed in 1910.

===Looting of Battleford===

On March 30, 1885, during the North-West Rebellion, the town of Battleford was looted by a party of Cree, who were short on food due to declining bison populations. When the Cree approached Battleford, the 500 residents fled to the nearby North-West Mounted Police post, Fort Battleford. The Crees then took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. Two people died during the looting. Crooked Leg was accused of killing John Payne, and Man Without Blood was accused of killing a farmer named Tremont. They were convicted of murder and hanged later that year.

<text>Juan Emilio Bosch y Gaviño (30 June 1909 – 1 November 2001), also known as El Profesor (Spanish for &quot;the Teacher&quot;), was a Dominican politician, historian, writer, essayist, educator, and the first democratically elected president of the Dominican Republic for a brief time in 1963. Previously, he had been the leader of the Dominican opposition in exile to the dictatorial regime of Rafael Trujillo for over 25 years. To this day, he is remembered as an honest politician and regarded as one of the most prominent writers in Dominican literature. He founded both the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) in 1939 and the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) in 1973.

==Early life==
Juan Bosch Gaviño was born in the city of La Vega on 30 June 1909. His father was a Spaniard from Catalan origin, and his mother was a Puerto Rican from Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico. He lived the first years of his childhood in a rural community called Río Verde, where he began his primary studies. He did his secondary studies at the San Sebastián de La Vega school, only reaching the third level of high school. In 1924 he moved to Santo Domingo, where he worked in several commercial stores. Later in 1929 he traveled to Spain, Venezuela and some Caribbean islands.
In 1934, he married Isabel García and had two children with her: Leon and Carolina. During Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship, Bosch was jailed for his political ideas, being released after several months. In 1938, Bosch managed to leave the country, settling in Puerto Rico.

==Exile==

By 1939 Bosch had gone to Cuba, where he directed an edition of the completed works of Eugenio María de Hostos, something that defined his patriotic and humanist ideals. In July, with other Dominican expatriates, he founded the &quot;Partido Revolucionario Dominicano&quot; (PRD), which stood out as the most active front against Trujillo outside the Dominican Republic.

Bosch heavily sympathised with leftist ideas, but he always denied any communist affiliation. He collaborated with the Cuban Revolutionary Party and had an important role in the making of Cuba&#x27;s 1940 Constitution.

Bosch met his second wife, Carmen Quidiello, a Cuban poet and playwright, in Matanzas in 1941. The couple married in 1943 and had two children, Patricio and Barbara. At the same time, his literary career was ascending, gaining important acknowledgments like the Hernandez Catá Prize in Havana for short stories written by a Latin American author. His works had a deep social content, among them &quot;La Noche Buena de Encarnación Mendoza&quot;, &quot;Luis Pié&quot;, &quot;The Masters&quot; and &quot;The Indian Manuel Sicuri&quot;, all of them described by critics as masterpieces of their sort.

Bosch was one of the main organizers of the abortive Cayo Confites expedition of 1947, in which a military force backed by the Caribbean Legion unsuccessfully attempted to invade the Dominican Republic from Cuba. Bosch fled to Venezuela after the expedition&#x27;s failure, where he continued his anti-Trujillo campaign. In Cuba, where he returned by requirement of his friends in the Authentic Revolutionary Party, he played a notorious part in the political life of Havana, being recognized as a promoter of social legislation and author of the speech pronounced by President Carlos Prío Socarrás when the body of José Martí was transferred to Santiago de Cuba.

When Fulgencio Batista led a coup d&#x27;état against Prío Socarrás and took over the presidency in 1952, Bosch was jailed by Batista&#x27;s forces. After being liberated, he left Cuba and headed to Costa Rica, where he dedicated his time to pedagogical tasks, and to his activities as leader of the PRD.

Molasses tycoon Jacob Merrill Kaplan earned his fortune primarily through operations in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. The J.M. Kaplan Fund was found in a 1964 congressional investigation to be a conduit for funneling CIA money to Latin America, including through the Institute of International Labor Research (IILR) headed by Norman Thomas, six-time presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America. These funds were used in Latin America by José Figueres Ferrer, Sacha Volman, and Juan Bosch.

Via the Fund, the CIA gave Figueres money to publish a political journal, &quot;Combate,&quot; and to found a left-wing school for Latin American opposition leaders. Funds passed from a shell foundation to the Kaplan Fund, next to the IILR, and finally to Figueres and Bosch.

In 1959 the Cuban Revolution took place, led by Fidel Castro, causing a major political, economic and social upheaval in the Caribbean island. Cord Meyer, a CIA official, was chief of International Organizations Division, a CIA-sponsored group for promoting democracy in international groups. He used the contacts with Bosch, Volman, and Figueres for a new purpose – as the United States moved to rally the hemisphere against Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, Rafael Trujillo, the strongman &quot;caudillo&quot; that ran the Dominican Republic for 30 years had become a liability. The United States needed to demonstrate that it opposed all dictators, not just those on the left.

Bosch accurately perceived the process that had begun from those events and wrote a letter to Trujillo, dated 27 February 1961. He told Trujillo that his political role, in historical terms, had concluded in the Dominican Republic.

For over a year, the CIA had been in contact with dissidents inside the Dominican Republic who argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo. According to Chester Bowles, the Undersecretary of State, internal Department of State discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous. Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo. Quoting Bowles directly: &quot;The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When Allen Dulles found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.&quot;

==Presidency and opposition==

In May 1961, the ruler of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo was assassinated. An internal CIA memorandum states that a 1973 Office of Inspector General investigation into the assassination disclosed &quot;quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters.&quot; The CIA described its role in &quot;changing&quot; the government of the Dominican Republic &quot;as a &#x27;success&#x27; in that it assisted in moving the Dominican Republic from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy.&quot;

After 23 years in exile, Juan Bosch returned to his homeland months after Trujillo was assassinated. His presence in the national political life, as the Dominican Revolutionary Party presidential candidate, was a fresh change for the Dominicans. His manner of speaking, direct and simple, especially when addressing the lowest classes, appealed to farmers as much as people from the cities. Immediately he was accused by the Church but he threatened to pull out of the election which caused the Church to retract the accusation; Conservatives also accused him of being a communist. However, in the elections of 20 December 1962, Bosch and his running mate, Armando González Tamayo, won a sweeping victory over Viriato Fiallo of the &quot;National Civic Union&quot; in what is acknowledged to be the first free election in the country&#x27;s history.

On 27 February 1963, Bosch was sworn in as president in a ceremony that was attended by important democratic leaders and personalities of the region, like Luis Muñoz governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and José Figueres of Costa Rica. Bosch immediately launched a deep restructuring of the country. On 29 April, he promulgated a new social democratic constitution. The new document changed the laws in various ways. Among other things, it declared specific labour regulations, and mentioned unions, pregnant women, homeless people, the family, rights for the child and the young, for the farmers, and for illegitimate children.

However, Bosch faced powerful enemies. He moved to break up latifundia, drawing the ire of landowners. The Church thought Bosch was trying to oversecularize the country. Industrialists did not like the new Constitution&#x27;s guarantees for the working class. The military, who previously enjoyed free rein, felt Bosch put them on too short a leash.

==Coup d&#x27;état==
On 25 September 1963, after only seven months in office, Bosch was overthrown in a coup led by General Elias Wessin y Wessin, General Antonio Imbert Barreras, and other military leaders which established a three-man military junta. Bosch was deported to Guadeloupe on 28 September 1963, but would fly to Puerto Rico on 1 October 1963, where he spent the remainder of his exile.

Less than two years later, growing dissatisfaction generated another military rebellion on 24 April 1965, that demanded Bosch&#x27;s restoration. The insurgents, commanded by Colonel Francisco Caamaño, removed the junta from power on 28 April. The United States dispatched 42,000 troops to the island in &quot;Operation Power Pack&quot; during the ensuing civil war in support of the anti-Bosch forces.

An interim government was formed, and elections were fixed for 1 July 1966. Bosch returned to the country and ran as his party&#x27;s presidential candidate. However, he ran a somewhat muted campaign, fearing for his safety and believing he would be thrown out of office by the military again if he won. He was soundly defeated by Joaquín Balaguer, who garnered 57% of the vote. The last US battalion left in September 1966.

During the last half of the 1960s, Bosch remained a very prolific writer of essays, both political and historical. He published some of his most important works during this time: &quot;Dominican Social Composition&quot;, &quot;Brief History of the Oligarchy in Santo Domingo&quot;, &quot;From Christopher Columbus to Fidel Castro&quot;, and numerous articles of different sorts.

By 1970, Bosch had the intention of reorganizing the PRD and turning its members into active, studious militants of the historical and social reality of the country. His project was not accepted by most of the PRD, most of whose members were turning in a more mainstream social democratic direction. Also, given the military repression, and lack of political equality between the PRD and the official Reformist Party, Bosch abstained from the 1970 elections.

Bosch became studious of Marxist ideology. He described himself as a &quot;Marxist- non Leninist&quot;. The differences and contradictions between Bosch and an important sector of the PRD on ideology, as well as the corruption that had started to grow within the party, made him leave the organization in 1973, and thus he founded the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) on 15 December of that same year. The PLD originally was considerably to the left of Bosch&#x27;s original party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party which continued to advocate for social democracy within the Socialist International organization.

Later he ran unsuccessfully for president as the PLD candidate in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994. He came closest to winning in 1990, but there were serious allegations of fraud against Balaguer.

After placing third in the 1994 election, Bosch retired from politics at the age of 83.

==Death and legacy==
Juan Bosch died on 1 November 2001, in Santo Domingo. As a former president, he received the corresponding honors at the National Palace, and was buried in his hometown of La Vega. A metro station in Santo Domingo was named in Bosch&#x27;s honor in 2009.

His wife, former First Lady Carmen Quidiello, died on 19 December 2020, at the age of 105.

<text>SMS (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship &quot;) was the sixth of seven s of the Imperial German Navy, named after the city of Leipzig. She was begun by AG Weser in Bremen in 1904, launched in March 1905 and commissioned in April 1906. Armed with a main battery of ten guns and two torpedo tubes, was capable of a top speed of .

 spent her career on overseas stations; at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was cruising off the coast of Mexico. After rejoining with the East Asia Squadron, she proceeded to South American waters, where she participated in the Battle of Coronel, where the German squadron overpowered and sank a pair of British armored cruisers. A month later, she again saw action at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, which saw the destruction of the East Asia Squadron. was chased down and sunk by the cruisers and ; the majority of her crew was killed in the battle, with only 18 survivors.

==Design==
The German 1898 Naval Law called for the replacement of the fleet&#x27;s older cruising vessels—steam corvettes, unprotected cruisers, and avisos—with modern light cruisers. The first tranche of vessels to fulfill this requirement, the , were designed to serve both as fleet scouts and as station ships in Germany&#x27;s colonial empire. They provided the basis for subsequent designs, beginning with the that was designed in 1901–1903. The principle improvements consisted of a larger hull that allowed for an additional pair of boilers and a higher top speed.

 was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship had a minimal superstructure, which consisted of a small conning tower and bridge structure. Her hull had a raised forecastle and quarterdeck, along with a pronounced ram bow. She was fitted with two pole masts. She had a crew of 14 officers and 274–287 enlisted men.

Her propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion steam engines driving a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by ten coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers, which were vented through three funnels located amidships. Her propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of . carried up to of coal, which gave her a range of at .

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle; six were located on the broadside, three on either side; and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried ten Maxim guns in individual mounts. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. She was also fitted to carry fifty naval mines.

The ship was protected by a curved armored deck that was up to thick; it sloped down at the sides to provide a measure of protection against enemy fire. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields.

==Service history==
 was ordered under the contract name &quot;N&quot; and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen on 12 July 1904 and launched on 21 March 1905, after which fitting-out work commenced. Work on the ship was completed, save the installation of her armament, by February 1906, when she underwent builder&#x27;s trials. The ship then moved to Wilhelmshaven to have her guns installed. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 April 1906 for sea trials that lasted until mid-June. During this period, (&quot;FK&quot;—Frigate Captain) Franz von Hipper served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. The ship concluded the initial period of service as the escort for Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was traveling on his annual summer cruise aboard the HAPAG steamer . Hipper thereafter left the ship.

===Peacetime career in East Asia===
 was assigned to the East Asia Squadron, and her crew began preparations for the voyage overseas on 19 August. She sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 8 September and, after passing through the Dutch East Indies, arrived in Hong Kong on 6 January 1907. There, she met the protected cruiser , another member of the East Asia Squadron. From 25 January to 10 March, lay as a guard ship at Qingdao, the capital of the Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory. She later steamed up the Yangtze river with the squadron commander aboard, (&quot;VAdm&quot;—Vice Admiral) Carl von Coerper; the gunboat and the torpedo boat accompanied on the trip. In June, she joined the rest of the cruisers of the squadron for a tour of northern ports in the region. In the first half of 1908, the East Asia Squadron embarked on another lengthy cruise in northern East Asian waters. made a shorter voyage in the Yellow Sea in August; that month, (&quot;KK&quot;—Corvette Captain) Richard Engel took command of the ship. In September and October, she visited Shanghai, China, and made another trip up the Yangtze. On 17 November, she represented Germany at a major naval review held in Kobe, Japan. That month, &quot;KK&quot; Karl Heuser relieved Engel as the ship&#x27;s captain.

 was dry-docked at Hong Kong for periodic maintenance in January 1909, and while there, she received orders to sail to German Samoa after the work was completed. Unrest against German rule threatened to break out, and the colonial governor, Wilhelm Solf, requested assistance from the East Asia Squadron. From Hong Kong, she proceeded to Manila in the Philippines; there, Coerper came aboard the ship for the voyage to Samoa. The ship arrived in Apia, the capital of German Samoa, on 19 March. By the 28th, she had been joined by the light cruiser and the gunboat , along with the steamer &quot;Titania&quot;, which carried a contingent of 100 local police. The local chief who had led the movement and some of his supporters were taken aboard to Saipan, where they were exiled. The ships patrolled off Samoa through April, but by early May, the ships began to disperse. and &quot;Titania&quot; departed on 6 May, while took Coerper to Suva, Fiji, stopping there from 14 to 17 May. There, he transferred to another vessel to return home. then briefly returned to Samoa, though she was replaced by the unprotected cruiser on 21 May. From there, steamed to Pago Pago in American Samoa, made a brief stop in Apia, before departing for Qingdao, arriving there by way of Pohnpei and Manila on 29 June. For the rest of the year, cruised with the squadron flagship, the armored cruiser , in northern waters.

In early 1910, and met the gunboat in Hong Kong, and the three vessels embarked on a voyage south. and cruised together, at times with , to visit Siam and various ports in the South China Sea. During this period, in February, &quot;FK&quot; Hermann Schröder arrived to take Heuser&#x27;s place as the ship&#x27;s commander. The two cruisers then steamed back north to visit Japan in April and May. made another voyage up the Yangtze in July, steaming as far as Hankou, where unrest had broken out. and the armored cruiser steamed to Calcutta, India, in early 1911 to meet Crown Prince Wilhelm, who was on a tour of East Asia. The ships arrived there on 31 January, but an outbreak of plague in the area led Wilhelm to cancel the rest of his trip. In March, the new squadron commander, (Rear Admiral) Günther von Krosigk, came aboard the ship to make a visit to Japan, where he met Emperor Meiji. Over the following months, visited a series of ports in Japan and in Siberia. While she was in Vladimir Bay in Russia in mid-August, Schröder learned of heightened tensions with France as a result of the Agadir Crisis; the Russians had severed the telegraph lines, however, so he could not communicate with Germany. The ship received a garbled wireless message that indicated Krosigk was to deploy his squadron to the Indian Ocean, but seeking confirmation, he dispatched to Vladivostok, Russia, despite the risk of entering the port of France&#x27;s ally. remained in the port from 15 to 18 August, exchanging telegraphs with Germany; by that time, the crisis had passed, and Krosigk decided to take his squadron south, through the Yellow Sea, before arriving in Qingdao on 15 September.

On 10 October, the 1911 Revolution broke out against Qing rule in China; since the unrest threatened foreign interests in the country, Krosigk deployed the ships of the squadron to defend German nationals, as did several other navies. was sent to reinforce the gunboats and , while was sent to Nanking and the gunboat to Hankou. Command of the international force assembled in China was given to the Japanese Rear Admiral Kawashima Reijirō. The ships sent landing parties ashore to defend foreign holdings, and they evacuated women and children to Shanghai, though Chinese attacks on foreigners did not materialize. , which by then had Krosigk aboard, was forced to leave Hankou in November due to falling water levels in the Yangtze, and she joined in Shanghai. spent the next several months cruising between Qingdao and the areas of the country beset by revolution. These activities concluded in early August 1912, and on 7 August, she began a trip that included stops in Vladivostok, Russia, and various ports in Japan. While there, she was present for the funeral ceremonies for Meiji. By the end of the year, had returned to Shanghai.

In early 1913, she visited cities along the central Chinese coast. In March, Johann-Siegfried Haun took command of the ship; he was to be her final captain. Her crew observed heavy fighting between imperial and republican forces around Nanking in July and August. The ship returned to Qingdao in September for an overhaul that lasted into October. She thereafter cruised south and visited the Philippines. In May 1914, received orders to replace the light cruiser , which was cruising off the Pacific coast of Mexico to protect German interests during the Mexican Revolution. She arrived off Mazatlán, Mexico, on 7 July, where she met and the cruiser ; the three German cruisers operated in concert with vessels from other navies to evacuate foreigners in the country. Because telegraph lines had been cut in Mexico, the German vessels did not learn of the July Crisis in Europe until 31 July, by which time World War I had broken out. transferred forty civilians to the neutral US armored cruiser and then made preparations for wartime operations.

===World War I===
 anchored at Magdalena Bay in Mexico to await developments, and on 5 August, Haun learned of the state of war between Germany and the Triple Entente. The established mobilization plan called for the ships of the East Asia Squadron to unite, but lacked collier support. She stopped in San Francisco to take on coal, but was unable to fully replenish her bunkers due to the United States&#x27; strict adherence to neutrality laws. Haun therefore decided to embark on a commerce raiding campaign against British merchant shipping. The lack of suitable targets led Haun to move south to the Gulf of California on 17 August to take on more coal. A week later, sank a British freighter carrying sugar and then proceeded to the Peruvian coast by the 28th. She stopped in Guaymas in neutral Mexico to take on a fresh load of coal on 8 September. She got underway two days later, headed further south in accordance with instructions from the German naval command, and on 11 September she stopped and sank the British oil tanker . She called in the Galápagos Islands to take coal from a German merchant ship and put &quot;Elsinore&quot;″s crew ashore. Reports of a British squadron in the area forced to leave.

The ship thereafter stopped to allow the crew to clean her badly fouled boiler tubes, before resuming her voyage to Easter Island. There, on 14 October, she joined the rest of the East Asia Squadron, by which time the unit was under the command of &quot;VAdm&quot; Maximilian von Spee. By that time, had accumulated a group of three colliers. On 18 October, the Squadron departed, bound for South America; they stopped in the Juan Fernández Islands while en route, and by 26 October, they were approaching Mas a Fuera. They then steamed to Valparaiso, Chile, where they received intelligence that indicated that the British cruiser was anchored in Coronel. Spee decided to proceed to Coronel to ambush the British ship when it left port. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was in fact joined by the armored cruisers and .

====Battle of Coronel====

While patrolling off Coronel, stopped a Chilean barque and searched her, but since she was a neutral vessel, and not carrying contraband, the Germans let her go. At 16:00 on 1 November, spotted a column of smoke in the distance, followed by a second ship at 16:17, and a third at 16:25. The British spotted at approximately the same time, and the two squadrons formed into lines of battle. was the third ship in the German line, behind the two armored cruisers. At 18:07, Spee issued the order &quot;Fire distribution from left&quot;, meaning that each ship would engage its opposite number; the Germans fired first, at 18:34.

 and quickly wrecked their British counterparts, while fired at &quot;Glasgow&quot; without success. At 18:49, &quot;Glasgow&quot; hit , but the shell was a dud and did not explode. and hit &quot;Glasgow&quot; five times before Spee ordered to close with the stricken &quot;Good Hope&quot; and torpedo it. A rain squall obscured the ship, and by the time reached &quot;Good Hope&quot;″s position, the latter had sunk. Unaware of the sinking of &quot;Good Hope&quot;, no rescue operations were mounted by ″s crew. By 20:00, encountered in the gathering darkness, and the two initially mistook each other for hostile warships, though they quickly established their identity. emerged from the battle essentially unscathed, and with no wounded crewmen.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Coronel, Spee decided to return to Valparaiso to receive further orders; while , , and went into the harbor, and escorted the colliers to Mas a Fuera. The rest of the East Asia Squadron joined them there on 6 November; the cruisers restocked their coal and other supplies. On 10 November, and were sent to Valparaiso, arriving on the 13th. Five days later, they rejoined the Squadron approximately west of Robinson Crusoe Island; the unified Squadron then proceeded to the Gulf of Penas, arriving on 21 November. There, they coaled and prepared to make the long voyage around Cape Horn. The British, shocked by their defeat at Coronel, had meanwhile dispatched the powerful battlecruisers and , under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee, to hunt down and destroy Spee&#x27;s ships. They departed Britain on 11 November and reached the Falkland Islands on 7 December, having been joined on the way by the armored cruisers , , and and the light cruisers and the battered &quot;Glasgow&quot;.

====Battle of the Falkland Islands====

On 26 November, the East Asia Squadron departed the Gulf of Penas, bound for Cape Horn and the Atlantic and reached the Cape on 2 December. While off the Cape, took the Canadian sailing ship &quot;Drummuir&quot; as a prize; the ship was carrying of coal, which was transferred to the colliers and &quot;Santa Isabel&quot; at Picton Island. On the night of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders to discuss his proposed attack on the Falklands; Haun, along with the commanders from and , opposed the plan and favored bypassing the Falklands to wage commerce war off La Plata. Nevertheless, Spee made the decision to attack the Falklands on the morning of 8 December.

The Germans approached Port Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, early on the morning of 8 December; the British quickly spotted them, and raised steam to go out and meet them. Spee initially thought the smoke clouds to be the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. Upon realizing the presence of the powerful British squadron, he broke off the attack and turned to flee. The British quickly steamed out of the harbor in pursuit. By 12:55, the battlecruisers had caught up to the retreating Germans, and opened fire on , the last ship in the German line, though she was not hit. Spee signaled &quot; released&quot; at 13:15 and five minutes later instructed the other light cruisers to flee while and turned on their pursuers, in the hope that he could cover their escape. In response, Sturdee sent his cruisers to chase down , , and .

&quot;Glasgow&quot; pursued , and quickly caught up, opening fire by 14:40. After about twenty minutes of firing, was hit; she turned to port to open the range, before turning to starboard in order to bring her full broadside into action. In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing &quot;Glasgow&quot; to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. was battered severely by &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In the course of the engagement, hit &quot;Cornwall&quot; eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on the stricken cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun still aboard. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.

<text>North Battleford is a city in west-central Saskatchewan, Canada. It is the seventh largest city in the province and is directly across the North Saskatchewan River from the Town of Battleford. Together, the two communities are known as &quot;The Battlefords&quot;.

North Battleford and the greater Battlefords area are a notable stop along the Yellowhead Highway, part of the Trans-Canada system, and serve as a commercial and cultural hub for west- and north-central Saskatchewan. Together, the Battlefords are served by the Yellowhead Highway as well as Highway 4, Highway 26, Highway 29, and Highway 40.

Battlefords Provincial Park is north on Highway 4.

==History==

For thousands of years prior to European settlement, succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area. The Battlefords area (including the present city of North Battleford and town of Battleford) was home to several historic indigenous groups, including the Algonquian-speaking Cree and Blackfeet as well as Siouan Assiniboine First Nation band governments, who contested for control of local resources.

Early European settlement began as a result of fur trading by French colonists in the late 18th century. The Canadians founded Fort Montaigne d&#x27;Aigle (Eagle Hills Fort) nine miles below the confluence of the Saskatchewan and Battle Rivers in 1778. A year later the fort was abandoned following conflict between traders and natives.

Permanent European settlement in the area centred around the town of Battleford, founded 1875 and located on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Battleford served as capital of the North-West Territories between 1876 and 1883.

In 1905, the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway main line to Edmonton placed the line on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River. North Battleford, built along the railway line, was incorporated as a village in 1906, as a town in 1907, and as a city (with a population of 5,000) in 1913.

The Assyrians were one of the first settlers of the area in and around North Battleford. The immigrant colony comprised 36 men and a few women from the town of Urmia in northwestern Persia. It was established in 1903 by Dr. Isaac Adams, an Assyrian Presbyterian missionary. In 1907, 40 more settlers arrived. Eventually, due to economic hardships, Dr. Isaac Adams and a few close relatives emigrated to Turlock, California. The descendants of the families who remained in North Battleford have names that are Assyrian in origin. Examples of Assyrian family names include Bakus, Essau, George and Odishaw.

Population growth stagnated until the 1940s and then grew to approximately 10,000 by the 1960s.
The city has grown into an administrative centre and service hub for the economic, education, health and social needs of the region.

North Battleford used STV-PR in its city elections from 1920 to 1924.

The Latter Rain Revival, a Christian movement, started here in 1946–48.

===Crime rate===
In 2018, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranked North Battleford as Canada&#x27;s most dangerous place for overall crime. The prior year, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; published an article about this, &quot;Canada&#x27;s most dangerous place, North Battleford, is fighting for its future&quot;, discussing the safety initiatives planned by the community.

After the article was published, Mayor Ryan Bater said:
The reality is we require the provincial and federal levels of government to take notice of this and align their efforts with ours. This needs to be a partnership. This can&#x27;t be something the governments do in silos and we need to be working together. If we can do that, then sometime in the future we can see some great results.
City Manager Jim Puffalt added that the per person index may not be accurate because the population data does not consider the numerous transients, estimated at just over 14,000. In his view, the city has roughly 30,000 people at any time. &quot;If you put our rates over 30,000 people we wouldn&#x27;t be number one [in the Maclean&#x27;s study],&quot; he said.

<text>The Chandy–Lamport algorithm is a snapshot algorithm that is used in distributed systems for recording a consistent global state of an asynchronous system. It was developed by and named after Leslie Lamport and K. Mani Chandy.

==History==
According to Leslie Lamport&#x27;s website, the snapshot algorithm was described when he visited Chandy, who was at the University of Texas (Austin). Chandy posed the problem over dinner, but they had had too much wine to think about it. The next morning, while Lamport was in the shower, he came up with the solution. When he arrived at Chandy&#x27;s office, he was waiting for him with the same solution. Lamport considers the algorithm to be a straightforward application of the basic ideas in his article &quot;Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System&quot;. 

==Definition==
The assumptions of the algorithm are as follows:
* There are no failures and all messages arrive intact and only once
* The communication channels are unidirectional and FIFO ordered
* There is a communication path between any two processes in the system
* Any process may initiate the snapshot algorithm
* The snapshot algorithm does not interfere with the normal execution of the processes
* Each process in the system records its local state and the state of its incoming channels

The algorithm works using marker messages. Each process that wants to initiate a snapshot records its local state and sends a marker on each of its outgoing channels. All the other processes, upon receiving a marker, record their local state, the state of the channel from which the marker just came as empty, and send marker messages on all of their outgoing channels. If a process receives a marker after having recorded its local state, it records the state of the incoming channel from which the marker came as carrying all the messages received since it first recorded its local state.

Some of the assumptions of the algorithm can be facilitated using a more reliable communication protocol such as TCP/IP. The algorithm can be adapted so that there could be multiple snapshots occurring simultaneously.

==Algorithm==
The Chandy–Lamport algorithm works like this:

# The observer process (the process taking a snapshot):
## Saves its own local state
## Sends a snapshot request message bearing a snapshot token to all other processes
# A process receiving the snapshot token &quot;for the first time&quot; on &quot;any&quot; message:
## Sends the observer process its own saved state
## Attaches the snapshot token to all subsequent messages (to help propagate the snapshot token)
# When a process that has already received the snapshot token receives a message that does not bear the snapshot token, this process will forward that message to the observer process. This message was obviously sent before the snapshot “cut off” (as it does not bear a snapshot token and thus must have come from before the snapshot token was sent out) and needs to be included in the snapshot.

From this, the observer builds up a complete snapshot: a saved state for each process and all messages “in the ether” are saved.

<text>The St Cuthbert Gospel, also known as the Stonyhurst Gospel or the St Cuthbert Gospel of St John, is an early 8th-century pocket gospel book, written in Latin. Its finely decorated leather binding is the earliest known Western bookbinding to survive, and both the 94 vellum folios and the binding are in outstanding condition for a book of this age. With a page size of only , the St Cuthbert Gospel is one of the smallest surviving Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. The essentially undecorated text is the Gospel of John in Latin, written in a script that has been regarded as a model of elegant simplicity.

The book takes its name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, North East England, in whose tomb it was placed, probably a few years after his death in 687. Although it was long regarded as Cuthbert&#x27;s personal copy of the Gospel, to which there are early references, and so a relic of the saint, the book is now thought to date from shortly after Cuthbert&#x27;s death. It was probably a gift from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey, where it was written, intended to be placed in St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin in the few decades after this was placed behind the altar at Lindisfarne in 698. It presumably remained in the coffin through its long travels after 875, forced by Viking invasions, ending at Durham Cathedral. The book was found inside the coffin and removed in 1104 when the burial was once again moved within the cathedral. It was kept there with other relics, and important visitors were able to wear the book in a leather bag around their necks. It is thought that after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England by Henry VIII between 1536 and 1541, the book passed to collectors. It was eventually given to Stonyhurst College, the Jesuit school in Lancashire.

From 1979 it was on long-term loan from the British province of the Jesuit order to the British Library, catalogued as Loan 74. On 14 July 2011 the British Library launched a fundraising campaign to buy the book for £9 million, and on 17 April 2012 announced that the purchase had been completed and the book was now British Library Add MS 89000.

The library plans to display the Gospel for equal amounts of time in London and Durham. It describes the manuscript as &quot;the earliest surviving intact European book and one of the world&#x27;s most significant books&quot;. The Cuthbert Gospel returned to Durham to feature in exhibitions in 2013 and 2014, and was in the British Library&#x27;s Anglo-Saxon exhibition in 2018/19; it also spends periods &quot;resting&quot; off display. A new book on the gospel was published in 2015, incorporating the results of research since the purchase; among other things this pushed the likely date from the late 7th century to between around 700 and 730.

==Description==

The St Cuthbert Gospel is a pocket-sized book, 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 × 3.6 in), of the Gospel of St John written in uncial script on 94 vellum folios. It is bound in wooden cover boards, covered with tooled red leather.

===Context===
The St Cuthbert Gospel is significant both intrinsically as the earliest surviving European book complete with its original binding and by association with the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. A miniature in the Codex Amiatinus, of the Prophet Ezra writing in his library, shows several books similarly bound in red decorated with geometric designs. This miniature was probably based on an original in the Codex Grandior, a lost imported Italian Bible at Jarrow, which showed Cassiodorus and the nine volumes he wrote of commentary on the Bible. Whether the bindings depicted, which were presumably of leather, included raised elements cannot be detected, but the books are stored singly flat in a cupboard, which would reduce the wear on any raised patterns.

Early medieval treasure bindings with a structure in precious metal, and often containing gems, carved ivory panels or metal reliefs, are perhaps better known today than leather bindings, but these were for books used in church services or as &quot;book-icons&quot; rather than for use in libraries. Of treasure bindings from this period, only the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels (750–800, Morgan Library) now survives complete, though there are several references to them, most famously to that of the Book of Kells, which was lost after a theft in 1007. Various metal fragments of what were probably book-mounts have survived, usually adapted as jewellery by Vikings. In the context of the cult of Cuthbert, the lavishly illuminated Lindisfarne Gospels were made at Lindisfarne, probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel, with covers involving metalwork, perhaps entirely made in it, which are also now lost. Plainer, very early bindings in leather are almost as rare as treasure bindings, as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed, and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining.

===Text===

The text is a very good and careful copy of the single Gospel of John from what has been called the &quot;Italo-Northumbrian&quot; family of texts, other well-known examples of which are several manuscripts from Wearmouth–Jarrow, including the Codex Amiatinus, and in the British Library the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Gospel Book MS Royal 1. B. VII. This family is presumed to have derived from a hypothetical &quot;Neapolitan Gospelbook&quot; brought to England by Adrian of Canterbury, a companion of Theodore of Tarsus who Bede says had been abbot of Nisida, an equally hypothetical monastery near Naples. In the rubrics of the Lindisfarne Gospels are several that are &quot;specifically Neapolitan&quot;, including festivals which were celebrated only in Naples such as The Nativity of St. Januarius and the Dedication of the Basilica of Stephen. The Neapolitan manuscript was probably at Wearmouth–Jarrow.

Apart from enlarged and sometimes slightly elaborated initials opening the Ammonian Sections (the contemporary equivalent of the modern division into verses), and others in red at the start of chapters, the text has no illumination or decoration, but Sir David Wilson, historian of Anglo-Saxon art and Director of the British Museum, used it as his example in writing &quot;some manuscripts are so beautifully written that illumination would seem only to spoil them&quot;. Julian Brown wrote that &quot;the capitular uncial of the Stonyhurst Gospel owes its beauty to simple design and perfect execution. The decorative elements in the script never interfere with the basic structure of the letter-forms; they arise naturally from the slanted angle at which the pen was held&quot;.

The pages with the text have been ruled with a blind stylus or similar tool, leaving just an impression in the vellum. It can be shown that this was done for each gathering with just two sets of lines, ruled on the outermost and innermost pages, requiring a very firm impression to carry the marks through to the sheets behind. Impressed lines mark the vertical edges of the text area, and there is an outer pair of lines. Each line of text is ruled, only as far as the inner vertical lines, and there are prick marks where the horizontal lines meet the verticals. The book begins with 19 lines on a page, but at folio 42 changes to 20 lines per page, requiring the re-ruling of some pages. This change was evidently a departure from the original plan, and may have been caused by a shortage of the very fine vellum, as two different sorts are used, though the change does not coincide exactly with the change in the number of lines.

Four passages are marked in the margin, which correspond to those used as readings in Masses for the Dead in the Roman lectionary of the mid-7th century. This seems to have been done hastily, as most left offset marks on the opposite pages from the book being closed before the ink was dry. This seems to indicate that the book was used at least once as the gospel book for a Mass for the Dead, perhaps on the occasion of Cuthbert&#x27;s elevation in 698. In the example illustrated at left, the start of the reading at line 10 is marked with a cross, and &quot;de mortuorum&quot; () written beside. The reading ends on the next page, which is also marked.

===Binding===

The original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving intact Western binding, and the virtually unique survivor of decorated Insular leatherwork. The decoration of the front cover includes colour, and the main motif is raised, which is unique among the few surviving Early Medieval bindings. The panels of geometrical decoration with two-stranded interlace closely relate to Insular illuminated manuscripts, and can be compared to the carpet pages found in these. Elements of the design also relate to Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the case of the general origin of interlace in manuscripts, and Coptic and other East Mediterranean designs.

The decoration of the covers includes three pigments filling lines engraved with a sharp pointed instrument, which now appear as two shades of yellow, one bright and the other pale, and a dark colour that now appears as blue-grey, but was recorded as blue in the earliest descriptions. The front cover includes all three colours, but the pale yellow is not used on the back cover. The pigments have been analysed for the first time, as one benefit of the purchase of the manuscript by the British Library, and identified by Raman spectroscopy as orpiment (yellow) and indigo (grey-blue). The balance of the designs on both covers is now affected by what appears to be the greater fading of the dark blue-grey pigment. The bookbinder Roger Powell speculated that the &quot;pale lemon-yellow ... may once have been green&quot;, giving an original colour scheme of blue, green and yellow on the red background, although the recent testing suggests this was not the case.

Given the lack of surviving objects, we cannot know how common the techniques employed were, but the quality of the execution suggests that the binder was experienced in them. At the same time, an analysis by Robert Stevick suggests that the designs for both covers were intended to follow a sophisticated geometric scheme of compass and straightedge constructions using the &quot;two true measures of geometry&quot;, the ratio between Pythagoras&#x27; constant and one, and the golden section. However slips in the complicated process of production, some detailed below, mean that the finished covers do not quite exhibit the intended proportions, and are both slightly out of true in some respects.

Although it seems clear from the style of the script that the text was written at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow, it is possible that the binding was then added at Lindisfarne; the form of the plant scrolls can be compared to those on the portable altar also found in Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, presumed to have been made there, though also to other works of the period, such as the shaft of an Anglo-Saxon cross from Penrith and the Vespasian Psalter. Small holes in the folds of each gathering seem to represent a &quot;temporary sewing&quot; together of the pages, one explanation of which is a journey made by the unbound pages.

====Front cover====

The decoration of the front cover is divided into fields bordered by raised lines. The central field contains a plant motif representing a stylised chalice in the centre with a bud and scrolling vine stems leading from it, fruit and several small leaves. Above and below the central motif are fields containing interlace ornament in finely incised lines. The three motifs are enclosed within a border containing further interlacing.

Continuous vine scrolls in a great variety of designs of the same general type as the central motif, with few leaves and round fruits, were very common in slightly later religious Anglo-Saxon art, and are often combined with interlace in the same work, especially on Anglo-Saxon crosses, for example the Bewcastle Cross and the Easby Cross now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. One face of the fragmentary silver cover of the portable altar also recovered from Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin has a similar combination of elements, with both areas of interlace and, in the four corners, a simple plant motif with a central bud or leaf and a spiral shoot on either side. The combination of different types of ornament within a panelled framework is highly typical of Northumbrian art, above all the Lindisfarne Gospels. Interlace may well have still been believed to have some quasi-magical protective power, which seems to have been its function in pre-Christian Germanic art. The vine motif here differs from the common continuous scroll type in that the stems cross over each other twice on each side, but crossing stems are also seen on the upper north face of the Bewcastle Cross and a cross in the church at Hexham. Meyer Schapiro compares the motif with one in an initial in the later Book of Kells. It was suggested by Berthe van Regemorter that in the St Cuthbert Gospel this design represents Christ (as the central bud) and the Four Evangelists as the grapes, following , &quot;I am the vine, ye are the branches&quot;, but this idea has been treated with caution by other scholars.

The two panels of interlace use the same design, of what David H. Wright describes as the &quot;alternating pair thin-line type&quot; which he calls &quot;perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types&quot;. The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line, part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used for the rest of the panels. It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.

The transition between the top left, perhaps where the artist began, and the standard pattern, is somewhat awkward, leaving a rather bald spot (for an interlace pattern) to the left of the first curving yellow vertical. The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off-centre to the right, whereas in the lower panel it falls slightly to the left of dead centre. These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand, without marking-out the pattern using compasses for example. The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight, being higher at the left, probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run. The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the Durham Gospel Book Fragment, an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne.

====Back cover====

The back cover is decorated more simply, with no raised elements and purely geometric decoration of engraved lines, which are filled in with two pigments which now appear as the bright yellow and the dark colour, once apparently blue. Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself, a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of 3mm squares, 21 tall and 10 wide. Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped &quot;crosses&quot;, or squares standing on one corner, with additional stepped elements in the four corners and halfway up the vertical sides, between the two &quot;crosses&quot;. The vertical axial line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right to the edges of the grid. The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour. This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages, as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles, and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous Sutton Hoo shoulder-clasps. The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect, as the top framing line was extended too far to the left. Traces of an uncoloured first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side, above the coloured line.

====Construction====
Although the binding had never been taken apart for examination before it was bought by the British Library, a considerable amount can be said about its construction. A combination of looseness through wear and tear, damage in certain places, and the failure of the paste that glued the pages to the inside of the covers, now allow non-intrusive inspection of much of the binding construction, including the rear of the actual wooden front cover board, and some of the holes made through it.

The raised framing lines can be seen from the rear of the front cover to have been produced by gluing cord to the board and tooling the leather over it, in a technique of Coptic origin, of which few early examples survive – one of the closest is a 9th- or 10th-century Islamic binding found in the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan, Tunisia. There are holes in the board in which the cut-off ends can be seen from behind.

The chalice and plant motif on the front, of which there is no trace from behind, has been built up using some clay-like material underneath the leather, as shown by CT-scans since the purchase. In the 2015 book, Nicholas Pickwoad suggests that this raised decoration was formed using a matrix which was pressed into the damp leather over the clay-like substance and the wooden board. Previous authors had suggested that the material under the relief decoration might have been built up in gesso as well as cord and leather scraps before applying the cover leather. A broadly similar plant motif in similar technique is found on a later Middle Eastern pouch in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.
The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.

The stitching of the binding uses &quot;Coptic sewing&quot;, that is &quot;flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)&quot; Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these &quot;unsupported&quot; bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.

==Dating==

The manuscript itself carries no date but a rather precise dating has been given to it, based mainly on its palaeography or handwriting, and also the known facts of Cuthbert&#x27;s burial. The dating was revised after the acquisition by the British Library, who added to their online catalogue entry:

Previously dated to the end of the 7th century (The Stonyhurst Gospel, ed. T. J. Brown (1969), pp. 12–13), R. Gameson dates the script to c. 710–c. 730 and L. Webster dates the decoration on the covers to c. 700–c. 730 (The St Cuthbert Gospel, eds C. Breay and B. Meehan (2015), pp. 33, 80).

The script is the &quot;capitular&quot; form of uncial, with just a few emphasized letters at the start of sections in &quot;text&quot; uncial. Close analysis of the changing style of details of the forms of letters allows the manuscript to be placed with some confidence within a chronological sequence of the few other manuscripts thought to have been produced at Wearmouth-Jarrow. The Northumbrian scribes &quot;imitate very closely the best Italian manuscripts of about the sixth century&quot;, but introduced small elements that gave their script a distinct style, which has always been greatly admired. However, there were several scribes, seven different ones working on the Codex Amiatinus, whose scripts may not all have developed at the same pace.

Key to this sequence is the Codex Amiatinus, an almost complete Bible for which we have a very precise &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;, and within which, because of its size, developments in style can be seen in a single manuscript. The Codex Amiatinus can be precisely located as leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow with a party led by Abbot Ceolfrith on 4 June 716, bound for Rome. The codex was to be presented to Pope Gregory II, a decision only announced by Ceolfrith very shortly before the departure, allowing the dedication page to be dated with confidence to around May 716, though the rest of the manuscript was probably already some years old, but only begun after Ceolfrith succeeded as abbot in 689. The script of the dedication page differs slightly from that of the main text, but is by the same hand and in the same &quot;elaborated text uncial&quot; style as some pages at Durham (MS A II 17, part ii, ff 103-11). At the end of the sequence, it may be possible to date the Saint Petersburg Bede to 746 at the earliest, from references in &quot;memoranda&quot; in the text, although this remains a matter of controversy.

There survive parts of a gospel book, by coincidence now bound up with the famous Utrecht Psalter, which are identifiable as by the same scribe as the Cuthbert Gospel, and where &quot;the capitular uncial of the two manuscripts is indistinguishable in style or quality, so they may well be very close to each other in date&quot;. Since the Utrecht pages also use Rustic capital script, which the Cuthbert Gospel does not, it allows another basis for comparison with further manuscripts in the sequence.

From the palaeographical evidence, T. Julian Brown concluded that the Cuthbert manuscript was written after the main text of the Codex Amiatinus, which was finished after 688, perhaps by 695, though it might be later. Turning to the historical evidence for Cuthbert&#x27;s burial, this placed it after his original burial in 687 but possibly before his elevation to the high altar in 698. If this is correct, the book was never a personal possession of Cuthbert, as has sometimes been thought, but was possibly created specifically to be placed in his coffin, whether for the occasion of his elevation in 698 or at another date. The less precise hints about dating that can be derived from the style of the binding compared to other works did not conflict with these conclusions, though in the new 2015 study, Leslie Webster now dates the cover to &quot;c. 700–c. 730&quot;, and Richard Gameson &quot;dates the script to c. 710–c. 730&quot;, as quoted above.

==History==

===Background===

Cuthbert was an Anglo-Saxon, perhaps of a noble family, born in the Kingdom of Northumbria in the mid-630s, some ten years after the conversion of King Edwin to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert&#x27;s lifetime. Edwin had been baptised by Paulinus of York, an Italian who had come with the Gregorian mission from Rome, but his successor Oswald also invited Irish monks from Iona to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.

The tension between the Roman and Irish traditions, often exacerbated by Cuthbert&#x27;s near-contemporary Saint Wilfrid, an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways, was to be a major feature of Cuthbert&#x27;s lifetime. Cuthbert himself, though educated in the Irish tradition, followed his mentor Eata in accepting the Roman forms without apparent difficulty after the Synod of Whitby in 664. The earliest biographies concentrate on the many miracles that accompanied even his early life, but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages, and also well able to impress royalty and nobility. Unlike Wilfrid, his style of life was austere, and when he was able he lived the life of a hermit, though still receiving many visitors.

He grew up near the new Melrose Abbey, an offshoot from Lindisfarne which is today in Scotland, but was then in Northumbria. He had decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but seems to have seen some military service first. He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon, soon after 655, but had to return with Eata to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead. About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. In 684 he was made Bishop of Lindisfarne, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die, although he was probably still only in his early 50s. After a few weeks of illness he died on the island on 20 March 687, and his body was carried back to Lindisfarne and buried there the same day.

===Lindisfarne===

Although first documented in 1104, the book is presumed to have been buried with Cuthbert at Lindisfarne, and to have stayed with the body during the wanderings forced by the Viking invasions two centuries later. Bede&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; recounts that Cuthbert was initially buried in a stone sarcophagus to the right of the altar in the church at Lindisfarne; he had wanted to be buried at the hermitage on Inner Farne Island where he died, but before his death was persuaded to allow his burial at the main monastery. His burial was first disturbed eleven years after his death, when his remains were moved to behind the altar to reflect his recognition, in the days before a formal process of canonisation, as a saint. The sarcophagus was opened and his body was said to have been found perfectly preserved or incorrupt. This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert&#x27;s posthumous cult, to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England.

Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains. In particular, Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, was inspired and encouraged in his struggle against the Danes by a vision or dream he had of Cuthbert. Thereafter, the royal house of Wessex, who became the kings of England, made a point of devotion to Cuthbert, which also had a useful political message, as they came from opposite ends of the united English kingdom. Cuthbert was &quot;a figure of reconciliation and a rallying point for the reformed identity of Northumbria and England&quot; after the absorption of the Danish populations into Anglo-Saxon society, according to Michelle Brown. The 8th-century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St Cuthbert around 720. He has been described as &quot;perhaps the most popular saint in England prior to the death of Thomas Becket in 1170.&quot; In 698, Cuthbert was reburied in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, though he was to have many more coffins. The book was believed to have been produced for this occasion and perhaps placed in his coffin at this time, but according to the new dating it was only created up to 30 years after 698.

===Fleeing the Danes===
In 793 Lindisfarne was devastated by the first serious Viking raid in England, but Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine seems to have escaped damage. In 875 the Danish leader Halfdene (Halfdan Ragnarsson), who shared with his brother Ivar the Boneless the leadership of the Great Heathen Army that had conquered much of the south of England, moved north to spend the winter there, as a prelude to settlement and further conquest. Eardulf, the Bishop of Lindisfarne, decided the monastery must be abandoned, and orderly preparations were made for the whole community, including lay people and children, to evacuate.

It was possibly at this point that a shelf or inner cover was inserted some way under the lid of Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, supported on three wooden bars across the width, and probably with two iron rings fixed to it for lifting it off. Eardulf had decided to take the most important remains and possessions of the community with them, and whether new or old, the shelf in Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin was probably loaded with the St Cuthbert Gospel, which was found there in 1104. It may also have held the Lindisfarne Gospels, now also in the British Library, and other books from Lindisfarne that were, and in several cases still are, at Durham Cathedral. Other bones taken by the party were those remains of St Aidan (d. 651), the founder of the community, that had not been sent to Melrose, and the head of the king and saint Oswald of Northumbria, who had converted the kingdom and encouraged the founding of Lindisfarne. These and other relics were reverently packaged in cloth and labelled, as more recent relics are. The community also took a stone Anglo-Saxon cross, and although they had a &quot;vehiculum&quot; of some sort, probably a cart or simple wagon, Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin was carried by seven young men who had grown up in the community.

They set off inland and spent the first months at an unknown location in west Cumberland, near the River Derwent, probably in the modern Lake District, and according to Symeon of Durham&#x27;s &quot;Libellus de exordio&quot;, the main source for this period, Eardulf tried to hire a ship on the west coast to take them to Ireland. Then they left the more remote west side of the country and returned to the east, finding a resting-place at Craike near Easingwold, close to the coast, well south of Lindisfarne, but also sufficiently far north of the new Viking kingdom being established at York.

Over the next century the Vikings of York and the north became gradually Christianized, and Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine became a focus of devotion among them also. The community established close relations with Guthred (d. 895), Halfdene&#x27;s successor as king, and received land from him at Chester-le-Street. In 883 they moved the few miles there, where they stayed over a century, building St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, where Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine was placed. In 995 a new Danish invasion led the community to flee some 50 miles south to Ripon, again taking the coffin with them. After three or four months it was felt safe to return, and the party had nearly reached Chester-le-Street when their wagon became definitively stuck close to Durham, then a place with cultivated fields, but hardly a settlement, perhaps just an isolated farm. It was thought that Cuthbert was expressing a wish to settle where he was, and the community obeyed. A new stone church—the so-called White Church—was built, the predecessor of the present Durham Cathedral.

===Durham Cathedral===

In 1104, early in the bishopric of Ranulf Flambard, Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new shrine behind the main altar of the half-built Norman cathedral. According to the earlier of the two accounts of the event that survive, known as &quot;Miracles 18–20&quot; or the &quot;anonymous account&quot;, written by a monk of the cathedral, when the monks opened the decorated inner coffin, which was for the first time in living memory, they saw &quot;a book of the Gospels lying at the head of the board&quot;, that is on the shelf or inner lid. The account in &quot;Miracle 20&quot; adds that Bishop Flambard, during his sermon on the day the new shrine received Cuthbert&#x27;s body, showed the congregation &quot;a Gospel of Saint John in miraculously perfect condition, which had a satchel-like container of red leather with a badly frayed sling made of silken threads&quot;. In addition the book itself has an inscription on folio 1r &quot;written in a modest book-hand apparently of the later twelfth century&quot; recording that it was found in the translation.

As far as is known the book remained at Durham for the remainder of the Middle Ages, until the Dissolution, kept as a relic in three bags of red leather, normally resting in a reliquary, and there are various records of it being shown to visitors, the more distinguished of which were allowed to hang it round their neck for a while. According to Reginald of Durham (d. ) &quot;anyone approaching it should wash, fast and dress in an alb before touching it&quot;, and he recorded that a scribe called John who failed to do this during a visit by the Archbishop of York in 1153–54, and &quot;held it with unwashed hands after eating was struck down with a chill&quot;. Books treated as relics are especially characteristic of Celtic Christianity; several of the surviving Irish book-shrines were worn in this way.

Another recorded copy of the Gospel of John has also been associated with Cuthbert, and sometimes thought to be the St Cuthbert Gospel. Saint Boisil (d. 664) of Melrose Abbey was Cuthbert&#x27;s teacher. Bede&#x27;s prose life of Cuthbert records that during Boisil&#x27;s last illness, he and Cuthbert read daily one of the seven gatherings or quaternions of Boisil&#x27;s manuscript of the Gospel of John. The sermon in &quot;Miracle 20&quot; identifies this manuscript with the one at Durham, and says that both saints had worn it round their necks, ignoring that it has twelve gatherings rather than seven. There are further references from Durham to Boisil&#x27;s book, such as a list of relics in the cathedral in 1389, and some modern scholars were attracted to the idea that they were the same, but Brown&#x27;s palaeographical evidence seems to remove the possibility of Boisil&#x27;s book being the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the 11th century Boisil&#x27;s remains had also been brought to Durham, and enshrined next to those of Cuthbert. Around the same time Bede&#x27;s own remains were stolen from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow for Durham, by a &quot;notably underhand trick&quot;, and placed in Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin, where they remained until 1104.

===After the Reformation===

It is thought likely that the book remained at Durham until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, although the various late medieval records of books and relics held there do not allow it to be identified with certainty. Durham Cathedral Priory closed in 1540, and some decades later the book was recorded by Archbishop Ussher in the library of the Oxford scholar, antiquary and astrologer Thomas Allen (1542–1632) of Gloucester Hall (now Worcester College, Oxford). However it is not in a catalogue of Allen&#x27;s library of 1622, and was not in the collection of Allen&#x27;s manuscripts that was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby in 1634. Nothing is then known of its whereabouts for a century or so.

According to an 18th-century Latin inscription pasted to the inside cover of the manuscript, the St Cuthbert Gospel was given by the 3rd Earl of Lichfield (1718–1772) to the Jesuit priest Thomas Phillips S.J. (1708–1774) who donated it to the English Jesuit College at Liège on 20 June 1769. Lichfield was an Anglican, but knew Phillips as the latter was chaplain to his neighbour in Oxfordshire, the recusant George Talbot, 14th Earl of Shrewsbury (1719–1787). The manuscript was owned between 1769 and 2012 by the British Province of the Society of Jesus, and for most of this period was in the library of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, successor to the Liège college.

The manuscript was first published when in 1806 it was taken to London and displayed when a letter on it by the Rev. J. Milner, presumably Bishop John Milner, Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, was read to a meeting of the London Society of Antiquaries, which was subsequently printed in their journal &quot;Archaeologia&quot;. Milner followed the medieval note in relating the book to Cuthbert, and compared its script to that of the Lindisfarne Gospels, by then in the British Museum, examining the two side by side. However he thought that &quot;the binding seems to be of the time of Queen Elizabeth&quot;! After the lecture it took some years to return to Stonyhurst as an intermediary forgot to forward it. That the binding was original, and the earliest European example, was realised during the 19th century, and when exhibited in 1862 it was described in the catalogue as &quot;In unique coeval (?) binding&quot;. The whole appearance and feel of the book, and the accuracy of the text and beauty of the script was highly praised by scholars such as Bishop Christopher Wordsworth (1807–1885), nephew of the poet and an important New Testament textual scholar, who described the book as &quot;surpassing in delicate simplicity of neatness every manuscript that I have seen&quot;.

===From 1950===

From 1950 onwards the binding was examined several times, but not altered, at Stonyhurst and the British Museum by Roger Powell, &quot;the leading bookbinder of his day&quot;, who had rebound both the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow, and also fully photographed by Peter Walters. Powell contributed chapters on the binding to the two major works covering the book, the first being &quot;The Relics of St Cuthbert&quot; in 1956, a large work with chapters on Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin and each of the objects recovered from it. The main chapter on the St Cuthbert Gospel was by Sir Roger Mynors, and Powell&#x27;s chapter incorporated unpublished observations by the leading bindings expert Geoffrey Hobson. The second came in 1969, when T.J. (Julian) Brown, Professor of Palaeography at King&#x27;s College, London, published a monograph on the St Cuthbert Gospel with another chapter by Powell, who had altered his views in minor respects. Brown set out arguments for the dating of the manuscript to close to 698, which has been generally accepted. The book was placed on loan to the British Library in 1979 where it was very regularly on display, first in the British Museum building, and from 1999 in the Ritblat Gallery at the new St Pancras site of the Library, usually displaying the front cover. Despite minor damages, some of which appear to have occurred during the 20th century, the book is in extremely good condition for its age.

In 2011 an agreement was reached with the Jesuit British Province for the British Library to buy the book for £9 million. This required the purchase money to be raised by 31 March 2012, and a public appeal was launched. In the early stages the emphasis was on raising large individual donations, which included £4,500,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which distributes some of the money from the profits of the National Lottery, £250,000 pledged by the Art Fund, and &quot;a similar sum&quot; by The Garfield Weston Foundation, and a large gift from the Foyle Foundation. By early March 2012 the British Library reported that there was &quot;only £1.5M left to raise&quot;, and on 17 April announced that the purchase had been completed, after their largest ever public appeal. The purchase &quot;involved a formal partnership between the Library, Durham University and Durham Cathedral and an agreement that the book will be displayed to the public equally in London and the North East.&quot; There was a special display at the British Library until June 2012, and after coming off display for detailed investigation the book went on display in Durham in July 2013 in Durham University&#x27;s Palace Green Library. Subsequently it has been on display in both London and Durham, but with periods &quot;resting&quot; off display. All the pages are accessible on the British Library website.

==The Gospel of John as an amulet==

There was a long and somewhat controversial tradition of using manuscripts of the Gospel of John, or extracts such as the opening verse, as a protective or healing amulet or charm, which was especially strong in early medieval Britain and Ireland. Manuscripts containing the text of one gospel only are very rare, except for those with lengthy explanatory glosses, and all the examples known to Julian Brown were of John. Disapproving references to such uses can be found in the writings of Saints Jerome and Eligius, and Alcuin, but they are accepted by John Chrysostom, Augustine, who &quot;expresses qualified approval&quot; of using manuscripts as a cure for headaches, and Gregory the Great, who sent one to Queen Theodelinda for her son. Bede&#x27;s prose &quot;Life&quot; mentions that Cuthbert combated the use of amulets and charms in the villages around Melrose. However, like many other leading figures of the church, he may have distinguished between amulets based on Christian texts and symbols and other types.

The size of the Cuthbert Gospel places it within the Insular tradition of the &quot;pocket gospels&quot;, of which eight Irish examples survive, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, with the possible exception of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56 mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John &quot;seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and it seems reasonable to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin to protect it&quot;.

<text>&quot;Shosholoza&quot; is an Nguni song that was sung by the mixed tribes of gold miners in South Africa. It is a mix of Zulu and Ndebele words, and can have various other South African languages thrown in depending on the singers. It was sung by all-male African workers that were performing rhythmical manual labour in the South African mines in a call and response style. The song is so popular in South African culture that it is often referred to as South Africa&#x27;s second national anthem.

==History==

&quot;Shosholoza&quot; is a traditional miner&#x27;s song, originally sung by groups of men from the Ndebele ethnic group that travelled by steam train from their homes in Zimbabwe (formerly known as Rhodesia) to work in South Africa&#x27;s diamond and gold mines. The Ndebele live predominantly in Zimbabwe near its border with South Africa. The song uses Ndebele words and is Zimbabwean in origin even though the Zulu and Zimbabwean Ndebele ethnic groups are very similar (see Nguni languages).

Some people argue that the song describes the journey to the mines in South Africa, while others say it describes the return to Zimbabwe. It is also sometimes sung &quot;stimela siphume Rhodesia&quot;. According to cultural researchers Booth and Nauright, Zulu workers later took up the song to generate rhythm during group tasks and to alleviate boredom and stress. The song was sung by working miners in time with the rhythm of swinging their axes to dig. It was usually sung under hardship in call and response style (one man singing a solo line and the rest of the group responding by copying him). It was also sung by prisoners in call and response style using alto and soprano parts divided by row. The late former South African President Nelson Mandela described how he sang Shosholoza as he worked during his imprisonment on Robben Island. He described it as &quot;a song that compares the apartheid struggle to the motion of an oncoming train&quot; and went on to explain that &quot;the singing made the work lighter&quot;.

In contemporary times, it is used in varied contexts in South Africa to show solidarity in sporting events and other national events to relay the message that the players are not alone and are part of a team.

Climate activists made the song the centrepiece of their Occupy COP17 rally on 9 December 2011, the final day of the United Nations climate treaty negotiations. Activists were calling on negotiators to &quot;Stand With Africa&quot; and agree to a legally binding and effective treaty.

==Meaning==
The song was usually sung to express the hardship of working in the mines. It expresses heartache over the hard work performed in the mines. The word &quot;Shosholoza&quot; or &quot;tshotsholoza!&quot; means &quot;go forward&quot; or &quot;make way for the next man&quot;, in Ndebele. It is used as a term of encouragement and hope for the workers as a sign of solidarity. The sound &quot;sho sho&quot; uses onomatopoeia and reminiscent of the sound made by the steam train (&quot;stimela&quot;). Stimela is an Nguni word for steam train.
&quot;Kulezo ntaba!&quot; means (At those far away mountains), &quot;Stimela Siphuma eZimbabwe&quot; (the train is coming from Zimbabwe), &quot;Wen&#x27; uya baleka&quot; (Because you&#x27;re running away/hurrying).
In contemporary times, its meaning is to show support for any struggle.

==Pop culture references==
The song is also used in pop culture to convey messages of hope and solidarity for athletes during competitions or in other times of hardship and distress.

===Recordings===
The song has been recorded by a variety of artists, including Pete Seeger, John Edmond, Helmut Lotti, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, PJ Powers, Soweto Gospel Choir, Peter Gabriel (as the B-side of his single &quot;Biko&quot;), Sérgio Dias and Drakensberg Boys&#x27; Choir, as well as being a standard of most gumboots bands, and also featured in the musical &#x27;King Kong&#x27; (1959).

===Rugby World Cup 1995===
The song gained further popularity after South Africa won the 1995 Rugby World Cup and is a favourite at sport events in South Africa. It was sung by the then Talk Radio 702 Breakfast Show co-host Dan Moyane. The song was recorded, mastered and released in five days, having been mastered in the UK to get it ready in time for the first game in the 1995 RWC. It was conceptualised and produced by Famous Faces Management&#x27;s CFF Stuart Lee. The record went gold in sales.

====Hollywood====
The South African a cappella group Overtone recorded the song for director Clint Eastwood&#x27;s movie &quot;Invictus&quot; (2009).

===FIFA World Cup 2010===
The song was also sung by the South African football team as they came onto the field of play to open the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

===Who is America===
Sacha Baron Cohen sings this song in an attempt to calm angry Arizonites who do not welcome a construction of a mosque in their town.

===Other references===
The first African challengers for the America&#x27;s Cup, Team Shosholoza, took their name from the song; as did the Shosholoza Meyl, a long-distance passenger train service operating in South Africa. The song is also used as a campfire song by scouts in South Africa.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of the song vary, as do the transcriptions. In the older traditional styles, the words translate to &quot;train from Rhodesia&quot;. Such is the version heard in the movie &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; and as sung by Pete Seeger in his album &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;. Here is one example:

<doc id="331555" wikidata="Q2684150" url="?curid=331555" title="Michael Ray Charles">
<text>Michael Ray Charles (born 1967) is an American painter born in Lafayette, Louisiana. He won the Rome Prize in 2018.

== Education and background ==
He spent most of his youth growing up in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and St. Martinville, Louisiana. He graduated from St. Martinville Senior High School in 1985. Later that fall, he entered McNeese State University, Lake Charles, Louisiana. Over the next three and a half years, Charles studied design and advertising before receiving a BFA degree in 1989. After receiving his MFA degree in 1993 from the University of Houston, Charles began teaching at the University of Texas at Austin and in 2014, he took a position at the University of Houston.

== Work and research==
Charles&#x27;s work and research is an investigation into the legacy of historic racial stereotypes of African Americans. His work examines how African Americans have been viewed in American history and also how they have come to view themselves as a result of demeaning stereotypes. In his colorful and graphic paintings and prints, Charles employs Black caricatures and stereotypes such as the Sambo, Aunt Jemima, grinning pickaninnies, and Uncle Tom, to comment on contemporary racial attitudes. His paintings have a scraped and antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art. With these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called Forever Free. This product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to African Americans by America and particularly also by the consumer market through their false images. To show connections between the past and the present, Charles takes common Black stereotypical characters and reinterprets them in contemporary ways. For example, the image of Aunt Jemima, a mammy, is one caricature that Charles often critiques in his work. The mammy character has historically been the caring house servant for the white family. However, in a painting where Charles parodies Norman Rockwell&#x27;s Rosie the Riveter, the Aunt Jemima is portrayed as kind of heroine. She sits royally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to white and Black America (a portrayal that would have never been in advertising at the time). At the same time, his ironic portrayals of the mammy are harsh critiques of her inferiority in commercial popular art. Charles sees the crafted image of mammies, along with other black characters, as an attempt to make them nonthreatening to whites. The same kind of approach can be seen in the way Charles treats images of the Blackface characters and minstrel shows. Charles appears to believe that by confronting racist and demeaning imagery, one can expose enduring subtle racist stereotypes.

== Public reception ==

Charles&#x27; aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy. In a 1999 &quot;ARTnews&quot; article, Charles once explained, &quot;Every time I have a show there are some black folks complaining.&quot; However, his blunt approach to his artwork suggests that he wants to elicit strong emotions from viewers. While many have criticized him for this, some have applauded Charles for his daring questioning. For example, director Spike Lee has spoken of the artist&#x27;s work as &quot;cinematic&quot;. &quot;His works are one-sheets, posters for movies that Hollywood would never have the nerve to make, exploring race and sex in this country.&quot;

== Career and achievements ==

In 1991, Charles presented his first solo exhibition at the Community Artists&#x27; Collective in Houston led by Michelle Barnes.

Charles is amongst the first group of artists showcased in the 2001 PBS series titled &quot;.&quot; The series highlights top artists of the 21st century. A 2003 article in &quot;Black Issues In Higher Education&quot; acknowledges Charles as one of the top future African-American scholars under forty. In 2000, he was a consultant on Spike Lee&#x27;s film, &quot;Bamboozled&quot; and has been the subject of several film documentaries.

He has served as a panelist for National Endowment for the Arts and jurors for The Bush Artist Fellowship and the Inaugural Biennial Underground Railroad Exhibition.

His work was included in the 2006 documentary &quot;Race is the Place&quot; and exhibitions at Cotthem Gallery in Barcelona and the PMMK Museum of Modern Art in Ostend, Belgium.

He lectures and exhibits nationally and internationally, and his work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in New York City, Düsseldorf, Paris, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Miami, and Santa Fe. His work is documented in many books, magazines, and newspapers as well as an extensive number public and private collection around the world including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, San Antonio Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and the Austin Museum of Art.

Charles continues to exhibit in national and international venues. His work remains the subject of books, magazines, and newspaper articles and is included in many public and private collection. Charles worked as a professor of art in the department of art and art history at The University of Texas at Austin until 2014. In 2014, Charles was appointed the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of Painting in the School of Art at the University of Houston. He lives in Houston, Texas.

In September 2019, Charles opened a new exhibition at the UMLAUF in Austin, Texas. The exhibit includes both old and new works, a site specific work about the slave ship &quot;Clotilda,&quot; as well as select items from Charles&#x27; research collection of racist imagery in advertising.

<text>Enuresis is a repeated inability to control urination. Use of the term is usually limited to describing people old enough to be expected to exercise such control. Involuntary urination is also known as urinary incontinence. The term &quot;enuresis&quot; comes from the .

Enuresis has been previously viewed as a psychiatric condition, however, scientific evidence has shown this view to be unsupported through current understanding of the condition and its underlying causes.

Management of enuresis varies and includes either mitigation via specialized nightwear or bedding, or identification and correction of the underlying cause, behavioral therapy, and the use of medications.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Nocturnal enuresis usually presents with voiding of urine during sleep in a child for whom it is difficult to wake. It may be accompanied by bladder dysfunction during the day which is termed non-mono symptomatic enuresis. Day time enuresis, also known as urinary incontinence, may also be accompanied by bladder dysfunction.

The symptoms of bladder dysfunction include:

# Urge incontinence – the presence of an overwhelming urge to urinate, frequent urination, attempts to hold the urine and urinary tract infections.
# Voiding postponement – delaying urination in certain situations such as school.
# Stress incontinence – incontinence that occurs in situations when increased intra-abdominal pressure occurs such as coughing.
# Giggling incontinence – incontinence that occurs when laughing.

Secondary incontinence usually occurs in the context of a new life event that is stressful such as abuse or parental divorce.

Signs indicating a child has a daytime wetting condition may include:
* urgency to urinate with leakage of urine
* urinating 8 times a day or more
* urinating less than a regular amount of 4-7 times a day (infrequent urination)
* inability to fully empty the bladder when urinating (incomplete urination)
* avoiding urine leakage through physical compensation, like squatting, squirming, leg crossing, or heel sitting.

Signs indicating a child has a nighttime wetting condition, if they are at least 5 years old, may include:
* bedwetting that occurs at least 2 times a week over at least 3 months
* reoccurrence of bedwetting after 6 months of no bedwetting.

=== Impact ===
It is recommended that children are made aware that bedwetting is not their fault, especially due to preconceived notions of inadequate parenting or psychiatric issues leading to enuresis. Untreated enuresis may lead to a lack of self-esteem or avoidance of social activities. Children with nocturnal enuresis are found to have lower quality of life, but it is not clear which aspects are most affected. More studies are needed to understand the impact of nocturnal enuresis on parents.

== Causes ==
Bedwetting children are often normal emotionally and physically, although enuresis can be caused by other health conditions. Primary nocturnal enuresis can have multiple causes, which can make approaching a course of treatment more difficult.

Enuresis can be caused by one or more of the following:

=== Caffeine consumption ===
Caffeine is a diuretic, which means that it increases urine production. Reports from those who have failed enuresis treatment say that they were not recommended to limit caffeine and that they mostly consume 2 to 4 mg/kg/day.

=== Pattern and volume of fluid intake ===
A pediatric day can be categorized into 3 periods: 7 AM to 12 PM, 12 PM to 5 PM, and after 5 PM. Children with enuresis are usually dehydrated and drink the most after 5 PM. This can be remedied by having the child drink 40% of daily fluid requirement before noon, 40% from noon to 4:30 PM, and 20% in the evening.

=== Lower functional bladder capacity ===

Children with enuresis have lower functional bladder capacity than healthy children. This means that their bladders hold less urine, often over 50% less.

=== Dysfunctional voiding ===
Both bladder voiding and storage problems may be present with dysfunctional voiding and may be present at any age. It is characterized by an obstruction of the bladder as a result of a non-neurogenic cause, which is due to the muscles controlling urine flow that do not completely relax. Symptoms may include daytime wetting, night wetting, urgency, a feeling that the bladder is always full, and straining to urinate.

=== Urinary tract infection ===
It is uncommon for nocturnal enuresis, in the absence of other symptoms, to be caused by an infection. Pinworms have also been linked with sudden onset enuresis in young girls.

=== Delay in maturation and development ===
Mastering urinary control during sleep time is a normal part of childhood development and may be delayed by stress and social pressures. The risk for enuresis increases threefold for children who experience stress, demonstrated by the higher prevalence of enuresis in lower socioeconomic groups.

Anxiety experienced by a child between ages 2 to 4 also increases the risk for enuresis because this particular time period is sensitive for the development of nighttime bladder control.

Nocturnal enuresis has been found to be more common in those with developmental delay, physical or intellectual disabilities, and psychological or behavioral disorders.

=== Bladder instability ===
Urodynamic sleep studies show that enuretic children have high pressure bladder contractions more frequently while they are asleep when compared to healthy children.

=== Nocturnal polyuria and antidiuretic hormone secretion ===
Nocturnal polyuria is defined as having more than 130% of the expected bladder capacity, which is specific for each age. Many children with nocturnal enuresis have altered nighttime secretion levels of antidiuretic hormone, which controls water retention in the body. This results in low antidiuretic hormone levels and excessive amounts of urine produced during sleep time.

=== Sleep disorders ===
The inability to wake from sleep has been understood as one cause of nocturnal enuresis, however studies focused on the importance of the time of night in which enuresis episodes occur have shown inconsistent results. Parents often report that their bedwetting children are very difficult to awaken from sleep, therefore research regarding enuresis has also aimed to elucidate why children with enuresis do not awaken from the sensation of a full bladder. Some studies have led to hypotheses that children with enuresis have altered hemodynamics during sleep (in terms of measurements of blood pressure and heart rate), sleep-disordered breathing, and altered hypothalamus function leading to a lack of bladder control during sleep.

=== Genetics ===
Enuresis is also theorized to be a hereditary condition based on epidemiological and genetic studies. Although several genes are considered of interest in relation to enuresis, lack of a single gene that may cause enuresis means that individuals of a family may have differing genetic mechanisms resulting in the condition.

== Pathophysiology ==
Currently, nocturnal enuresis is understood to be caused by three main underlying factors: excess urine production at night, lack of capacity for bladder storage, and inability to wake from sleep, with pathogenesis possibly varying based on presence of daytime symptoms. The inability to control the detrusor muscle has been theorized as a possible pathophysiological cause of enuresis, which may explain why anticholinergic drugs are effective as medication therapy, since they act on the detrusor muscles.

== Diagnosis ==
Clinical definition of enuresis is urinary incontinence beyond age of 4 years for daytime and beyond 6 years for nighttime, or loss of continence after three months of dryness.
Current DSM-5 criteria:
* Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (whether involuntary or intentional)
* Behavior must be clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of twice a week for at least three consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning.
* Chronological age is at least 5 years of age (or equivalent developmental level).
* The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effect of a substance (such as a diuretic) or a general medical condition (such as diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder, etc.).
All these criteria must be met in order to diagnose an individual. Generally, healthcare providers may further investigate for bladder control issues if a child is still enuretic in the daytime by age 4, or if they are still enuretic at nighttime by age 5 or 6.

=== Classification ===
The International Children&#x27;s Continence Society (ICCS) has developed the following standard terminology:
* Primary enuresis refers to children who have never been successfully trained to control urination.
* Secondary enuresis refers to children who have been successfully trained and are continent for at least 6 months but revert to wetting in a response to some sort of stressful situation.

There are 2 categories of enuresis:
* Monosymptomatic enuresis (MNE) – Does not include bladder dysfunction during daytime.
* Nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NMNE) – Includes bladder dysfunction causing daytime incontinence that is frequent and urgent. Wetting that occurs in the daytime is sometimes referred to as diurnal enuresis. Other conditions, or comorbidities, that commonly accompany enuresis may be expected to be more common with NMNE.

== Management ==
There are a number of management options for enuresis. Management of enuresis, both nocturnal and daytime, can include behavioral therapy, drug therapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and other alternative medicine therapies. Treatment of enuresis for children under 5 years old is not recommended. In adults with nocturnal enuresis, use of a bedwetting diary, which keeps track of when enuresis occurs, may be helpful for healthcare providers to figure out the causes of a person&#x27;s enuresis and their best route for treatment.
=== Behavioral therapy ===
Simple behavioral interventions may prove to be superior in comparison to no ongoing form of treatment and are recommended as initial treatment.
* Nighttime fluid limitation
* Enuresis alarm – includes sleeping mats with electrical circuits; alarms with sensors placed in child&#x27;s underwear; alarms that are wired or wireless and produce noise, vibration, or light; and alarm clocks or mobile phones for older individuals
* Motivational therapy
* Bladder training – training the bladder to hold more urine
* Reward systems – give star charts for dry nights
* Lifting – carrying the child, who is still asleep, away from the bed to an appropriate place to urinate
Waking a child up at night is not a medically supported long-term cure or solution for nocturnal enuresis, and may just be a one-time solution even if it appears to resolve enuresis.

==== Neurostimulation ====
Evidence suggests that neurostimulation therapy may be an efficacious and safe form of treatment of pediatric primary enuresis, also known as bedwetting. Neurostimulation of the sacral nerve is an option for children in which all other therapies have failed. Neurostimulation treatment of adult enuresis may be considered prior to pursuing surgical methods. For adult enuresis, sacral nerve stimulation can be administered to decrease bladder muscle activity so that the bladder muscles are not constantly in a contracted state to help improve enuresis symptoms.

==== Hypnotherapy ====
Hypnotherapy is often performed under the guidance of a licensed clinician or hypnotherapist. It is a guided state of relaxation, concentration and focused attention, and is often where the individual is in a guided trance-like state to treat conditions such as pediatric enuresis. However, some studies have shown that the utilization of enuresis alarm may be more effective than hypnotherapy. On the other hand, certain types of hypnotherapy may be more effective compared to no treatment of enuresis, but evidence is insufficient.

=== Medications ===
Nighttime incontinence may be treated by increasing antidiuretic hormone levels. The hormone can be boosted by a synthetic version known as desmopressin, or DDAVP. Desmopressin is approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis and is available in both spray and tablet formulations. There is good short-term success rate; however, there is difficulty in keeping the bed dry after medication is stopped.

In children whose enuresis symptoms do not resolve with desmopressin, anticholinergic drugs may be effective as a second-line therapy or as an add-on drug with desmopressin. However currently only oxybutynin has an FDA-approved labeled indication in children aged 6 and older. An additional third-line alternative shown to be effective is the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, however the use of tricyclic antidepressants carries the risk of cardiotoxicity and is not recommended to be given without evaluating a person&#x27;s risk factors for certain heart diseases.

=== Acupuncture ===
There are multiple studies examining the efficacy of acupuncture in treating nocturnal enuresis in children, but the evidence is generally of low quality and has multiple limitations. Therefore, there is not strong evidence to suggest that acupuncture is useful for treating enuresis.

== Epidemiology ==
Approximately 10% of six- to seven-year-olds around the world experience enuresis. While 15% to 20% of five‐year‐old children experience nocturnal enuresis which usually goes away as they grow older, approximately 2% to 5% of young adults experience nocturnal enuresis. About 3% of teenagers and 0.5% to 1% of adults experience enuresis or bedwetting, with the chance of it resolving being lower if it is considered frequent.

== History ==
Enuresis was first documented in the Ebers Papyrus in 1550 BCE. Roman author Gaius Plinius Secundus (CE 23/24–79) (&quot;Pliny the Elder&quot;) documents nocturnal enuresis in his work, &quot;Natural History&quot; (CE 77), stating that &quot;the incontinence of urine in infants is checked by giving boiled mice in their food.&quot; Furthermore, in the eighteenth century, children with enuresis were subjected to a variety of chemical and mechanical treatments including fluid restriction, enemata, the use of an alarm clock, cold baths, warm baths, cold dashes to the perineum and douches to the lower spine.

Enuresis has previously been documented as an occurrence in members of the military. During World War II, bedwetting was considered as part of neuropsychiatric evaluation of a soldier for discharge.

<doc id="331560" wikidata="Q120688" url="?curid=331560" title="St. Elmo's fire">
<text>St. Elmo&#x27;s fire (also called witchfire or witch&#x27;s fire) is a weather phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a corona discharge from a rod-like object such as a mast, spire, chimney, or animal horn in an atmospheric electric field. It has also been observed on the leading edges of aircraft, as in the case of British Airways Flight 009, and by US Air Force pilots. 

The intensity of the effect, a blue or violet glow around the object, often accompanied by a hissing or buzzing sound, is proportional to the strength of the electric field and therefore noticeable primarily during thunderstorms or volcanic eruptions.

St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is named after St. Erasmus of Formia (also known as St. Elmo), the patron saint of sailors. The phenomenon, which can warn of an imminent lightning strike, was regarded by sailors with awe and sometimes considered to be a good omen.

==Cause==
St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is a reproducible and demonstrable form of plasma. The electric field around the affected object causes ionization of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo&#x27;s fire are present during thunderstorms, when high-voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local electric field of about is required to begin a discharge in moist air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature, so discharges preferentially occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.

The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere cause St. Elmo&#x27;s fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon lights to glow, albeit at a different colour due to the different gas involved.

In 1751, Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that a pointed iron rod would light up at the tip during a lightning storm, similar in appearance to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire.

In an August 2020 paper, researchers in MIT&#x27;s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics demonstrated that St. Elmo&#x27;s fire behaves differently in airborne objects versus grounded structures. They show that electrically isolated structures accumulate charge more effectively in high wind, in contrast to the corona discharge observed in grounded structures.

==Research==
===Vacuum ultraviolet light===
Researchers at Rutgers University have devised a method to generate vacuum ultraviolet light using different forms of lighting, by employing sharp conductive needles placed within a dense gas, such as xenon, contained in a cell. They achieve this by applying a high negative voltage to the needles in the xenon-filled cell, resulting in the efficient production of vacuum ultraviolet light. St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire being similar, they believe it could be used as lighting but with a higher power source, thus increasing efficiency by over 50%.

==In history and culture==
*In ancient Greece, the appearance of a single instance of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire was called (), literally meaning &quot;torch&quot;, with two instances referred to as Castor and Pollux, names of the mythological twin brothers of Helen.
*After the medieval period, St. Elmo&#x27;s fire was sometimes associated with the Greek element of fire, such as with one of Paracelsus&#x27;s elementals, specifically the salamander, or, alternatively, with a similar creature referred to as an acthnici.
*Welsh mariners referred to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire as or (&quot;candles of the Holy Ghost&quot; or the &quot;candles of St. David&quot;).
*Russian sailors also historically documented instances of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, known as &quot;Saint Nicholas&quot; or &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s lights&quot;, also sometimes called St. Helen&#x27;s or St. Hermes&#x27; fire, perhaps through linguistic confusion.
*St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is reported to have been seen during the Siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. It was reportedly seen emitting from the top of the Hippodrome. The Byzantines attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering Muslim army. According to George Sphrantzes, it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire.
*Accounts of Magellan&#x27;s first circumnavigation of the globe refer to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire (calling it the body of St. Anselm) being seen around the fleet&#x27;s ships multiple times off the coast of South America. The sailors saw these as favourable omens.
*En route to Nagasaki with the Fat Man atom bomb on 9 August 1945, the B-29 &quot;Bockscar&quot; experienced an uncanny luminous blue plasma forming around the spinning propellers, &quot;as though we were riding the whirlwind through space on a chariot of blue fire.&quot;
*St Elmo&#x27;s fire was seen during the 1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak in Kansas and Oklahoma.
*Among the phenomena experienced on British Airways Flight 9 on 24 June 1982, were glowing light flashes along the leading edges of the aircraft, including the wings and cockpit windscreen, which were seen by both passengers and crew. While the bright flashes of light shared similarities with St Elmo&#x27;s fire, the glow experienced was from the impact of ash particles on the leading edges of the aircraft, similar to that seen by operators of sandblasting equipment.
*St. Elmo&#x27;s fire was observed and its optical spectrum recorded during a University of Alaska research flight over the Amazon in 1995 to study sprites.
*Ill-fated Air France Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2009 is understood to have experienced St. Elmo&#x27;s fire 23 minutes prior to crashing into the Atlantic Ocean; however, the phenomenon was not a factor in the disaster.
*Apoy ni San Elmo – commonly shortened to santelmo – is a bad omen or a flying spirit in Filipino folklore, although the description for santelmo is more similar to ball lightning than St. Elmo&#x27;s fire. There are various indigenous names for santelmo which has existed before the term santelmo was coined. The term santelmo originated from Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines.

==Notable observations==
===Classical texts===
St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is referenced in the works of Julius Caesar (&quot;De Bello Africo&quot;, 47) and Pliny the Elder (&quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, book 2, par. 101), Alcaeus frag. 34. Earlier, Xenophanes of Colophon had alluded to the phenomenon.

===Zheng He===
In 15th-century Ming China, Admiral Zheng He and his associates composed the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions, the two epitaphs of the Ming treasure voyages, where they made a reference to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire as a divine omen of Tianfei, the goddess of sailors and seafarers.
===Accounts associated with Magellan and da Gama===
Mention of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire can be found in Antonio Pigafetta&#x27;s journal of his voyage with Ferdinand Magellan. St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, also known as &quot;corposants&quot; or &quot;corpusants&quot; from the Portuguese &quot;corpo santo&quot; (&quot;holy body&quot;), is also described in &quot;The Lusiads&quot;, the epic account of Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyages of discovery.

===Robert Burton===
Robert Burton wrote of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire in his &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; (1621): &quot;Radzivilius, the Lithuanian duke, calls this apparition &quot;Sancti Germani sidus&quot;; and saith moreover that he saw the same after in a storm, as he was sailing, 1582, from Alexandria to Rhodes&quot;. This refers to the voyage made by Mikołaj Krzysztof &quot;the Orphan&quot; Radziwiłł in 1582–1584.

===John Davis===
On 9 May 1605, while on the second voyage of John Davis commanded by Sir Edward Michelborne to the East Indies, an unknown writer aboard the &quot;Tiger&quot; describes the phenomenon: &quot;In the extremity of our storm appeared to us in the night, upon our maine Top-mast head, a flame about the bigness of a great Candle, which the Portugals call &quot;Corpo Sancto&quot;, holding it a most divine token that when it appeareth the worst is past. As, thanked be God, we had better weather after it&quot;.

===Pierre Testu-Brissy===

Pierre Testu-Brissy was a pioneering French balloonist. On 18 June 1786, he flew for 11 hours and made the first electrical observations as he ascended into thunderclouds. He stated that he drew remarkable discharges from the clouds by means of an iron rod carried in the basket. He also experienced Saint Elmo&#x27;s fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballooning Who&#x27;s Who&quot;/

===William Bligh===
William Bligh recorded in his log on Sunday 4 May 1788, on board HMS Bounty of &#x27;Mutiny On The Bounty&#x27; fame:
&#x27;Corpo-Sant. Some electrical Vapour seen about the Iron at the Yard Arms about the Size of the blaze of a Candle.&#x27;
The location of this event was in the South Atlantic sailing from Cape Horn, (having failed to round the cape in the winter months), en route to Cape of Good Hope and west of Tristan da Cunha. The log records the ship&#x27;s location as: Latd. 42°:34&#x27;S, Longd (by the time keeper K2) as 34°:38&#x27;W.
Reference: Log of the Proceedings of His Majestys Ship Bounty in a Voyage to the South Seas, (to take the Breadfruit plant from the Society Islands to the West Indies,) under the Command of Lieutenant William Bligh, 1 December 1787 – 22 October 1788 Safe 1/46, Mitchell Library, State Library of NSW

===William Noah===
William Noah, a silversmith convicted in London of stealing 2,000 pounds of lead, while en route to Sydney, New South Wales on the convict transport ship , recorded two such observations in his detailed daily journal. The first was in the Southern Ocean midway between Cape Town and Sydney and the second was in the Tasman Sea, a day out of Port Jackson:
While the exact nature of these weather phenomena cannot be certain, they appear to be mostly about two observations of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire with perhaps some ball lightning and even a direct lightning strike to the ship thrown into the mix.

===James Braid===
On 20 February 1817, during a severe electrical storm, James Braid, surgeon at Lord Hopetoun&#x27;s mines at Leadhills, Lanarkshire, had an extraordinary experience whilst on horseback:
Weeks earlier, reportedly on 17 January 1817, a luminous snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire. Saint Elmo&#x27;s fire appeared as static discharges on roof peaks, fence posts, and the hats and fingers of people. Thunderstorms prevailed over central New England.

===Charles Darwin===
Charles Darwin noted the effect while aboard the &quot;Beagle&quot;. He wrote of the episode in a letter to J. S. Henslow that one night when the &quot;Beagle&quot; was anchored in the estuary of the Río de la Plata:
He also describes the above night in his book &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;:
===Richard Henry Dana===
In &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, Richard Henry Dana Jr., (1815–1882) describes seeing a corposant in the horse latitudes of the northern Atlantic Ocean. However, he may have been talking about ball lightning; as mentioned earlier, it is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo&#x27;s fire:

The observation by R. H. Dana of this phenomenon in &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; is a straightforward description of an extraordinary experience apparently only known to mariners and airline pilots.

===Nikola Tesla===
Nikola Tesla created St. Elmo&#x27;s fire in 1899 while testing a Tesla coil at his laboratory in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. St. Elmo&#x27;s fire was seen around the coil and was said to have lit up the wings of butterflies with blue halos as they flew around.

===Mark Heald===
A minute before the crash of the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin&#x27;s LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; on 6 May 1937, Professor Mark Heald (1892–1971) of Princeton saw St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire flickering along the airship&#x27;s back. Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the airship approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Heald&#x27;s estimation, he first noticed a dim &quot;blue flame&quot; flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, &quot;Oh, heavens, the thing is afire,&quot; for her to reply, &quot;Where?&quot; and for him to answer, &quot;Up along the top ridge&quot; – before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship&#x27;s length from the stern.

===William L. Laurence===
St. Elmo&#x27;s fire was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter William L. Laurence on 9 August 1945, as he was aboard a plane following &quot;Bockscar&quot; on the way to Nagasaki.
==In popular culture==

=== In literature ===

One of the earliest references to the phenomenon appears in Alcaeus&#x27;s Fragment 34a about the Dioscuri, or Castor and Pollux. It is also referenced in Homeric Hymn 33 to the Dioscuri who were from Homeric times associated with it. Whether the Homeric Hymn antedates the Alcaeus fragment is unknown.

The phenomenon appears to be described first in the &quot;Gesta Herwardi&quot;, written around 1100 and concerning an event of the 1070s. However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire made in fiction can be found in Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:
In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo&#x27;s fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:

The fires are also mentioned as &quot;death fires&quot; in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;:

Later in the 18th and 19th centuries, literature associated St. Elmo&#x27;s fire with a bad omen or divine judgment, coinciding with the growing conventions of Romanticism and the Gothic novel. For example, in Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:

In the 1864 novel &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; by Jules Verne, the author describes the fire occurring while sailing during a subterranean electrical storm (chapter 35, page 191):

In Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Starbuck points out &quot;corpusants&quot; during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119, &quot;The Candles&quot;.

St. Elmo&#x27;s fire makes an appearance in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, by Hergé. Tintin recognizes the phenomenon on Captain Haddock&#x27;s ice-axe.

The phenomenon appears in the first stanza of Robert Hayden&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ballad of Nat Turner&quot;; it is also referred to with the term &quot;corposant&quot; in the first section of his long poem &quot;Middle Passage&quot;.

In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Billy Pilgrim sees the phenomenon on soldiers&#x27; helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord&#x27;s dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.

In Robert Aickman&#x27;s story &quot;Niemandswasser&quot; (1975), the protagonist, Prince Albrecht von Allendorf, is &quot;known as Elmo to his associates, because of the fire which to them emanated from him&quot;. &quot;There was an inspirational force in Elmo of which the sensitive soon became aware, and which had led to his &quot;Spottname&quot; or nickname.&quot;

In &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; by Laura Ingalls Wilder, St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma&#x27;s knitting needles; it did not burn the floor (pages 309–310). The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to ball lightning.

In &quot;Voyager&quot;, the third major novel in Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s popular &quot;Outlander&quot; series, the primary characters experience St. Elmo&#x27;s fire while lost at sea in a thunderstorm between Hispaniola and coastal Georgia.

St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is also mentioned in the novel, &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman&quot; by Brian Jacques.

It is referenced multiple times in the novel &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; by Stephen King.

It is referenced multiple times in the Urban-Fantasy series &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; by Jim Butcher, particularly when magical beings such as the protagonist&#x27;s dog are exerting power, especially during conflict, or to describe the visual effects of magic being used.

=== In television ===
On the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot; (1982), episode four shows St. Elmo&#x27;s fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the Strait of Magellan. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to: &quot;Although I&#x27;ve never seen St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, I&#x27;d certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen, as it played havoc with compasses and equipment&quot;. The TV series also referred to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.

On the American television series &quot;Rawhide&quot;, in a 1959 episode titled &quot;Incident of the Blue Fire&quot;, cattle drovers on a stormy night see St. Elmo&#x27;s fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen. St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is also referenced in a 1965 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; in which religious pilgrims staying on the Cartwright property believe an experience with St. Elmo&#x27;s fire is the work of Satan.

On &quot;The Waltons&quot; episode &quot;The Grandchild&quot; (1977), Mary Ellen witnesses St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire while running through the woods.

On the American animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot; episode titled &quot;Möbius Dick&quot;, Turanga Leela refers to the phenomenon as &quot;Tickle me Elmo&#x27;s Fire.&quot;

On the Netflix original Singaporean animated series &quot;Trese&quot; (2021), the Santelmo (St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire) is one of the protagonist&#x27;s, Alexandra Trese&#x27;s, allies whom she contacts using her old Nokia phone, dialing the date of the Great Binondo fire, 0003231870.

===In film===

*In &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), St. Elmo&#x27;s fire stops Captain Ahab from killing Starbuck.
*In &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961), outlaw/cowhand Brendan &quot;Bren&quot; O&#x27;Malley (Kirk Douglas) rides in from the herd and leads the recently widowed Belle Breckenridge (Dorothy Malone) to an overview of the cattle. As he takes the rifle from her, he proclaims, &quot;Something out there, you could live five lifetimes, and never see again,&quot; the audience is then shown a shot of the cattle with a blue or violet glow coming from their horns. &quot;Look. St. Elmo&#x27;s fire. Never seen it except on ships,&quot; O&#x27;Malley says as Belle says, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen it anywhere. What is it?&quot; Trying to win her back, he says, &quot;Well, a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place.&quot;
*In &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985), Rob Lowe&#x27;s character Billy Hicks erroneously claims that the phenomenon is &quot;not even a real thing.&quot;
*In the Western miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989–1990), lightning strikes a herd of cattle during a storm, causing their horns to glow blue.
*In The Hunt for Red October (film) (1990) during a scene where the USS Dallas, a Los-Angeles-class submarine, is attempting to evade a torpedo, the crew discusses the presence of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire on the sub&#x27;s periscope.
*In The Perfect Storm (film); based on the true story of the Andrea Gail fishing vessel, there is a scene where the crew encounters St. Elmo&#x27;s fire during the height of a storm.
*In Lars von Trier&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Melancholia&quot;, the phenomenon features in the opening sequence and later in the film as the rogue planet Melancholia approaches the Earth for an impact event.
*In Robert Eggers&#x27;s 2019 horror film &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;, it appears in reference to the mysterious salvation that lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) is hiding from Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) inside the Fresnel lens of the lantern.

===In music===
*Brian Eno&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Another Green World&quot; (1975) contains a song titled &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; in which guesting King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp (credited with playing &quot;Wimshurst guitar&quot; in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a Wimshurst high-voltage generator.
*&quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; is a song recorded by John Parr. It hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 7 September 1985, remaining there for two weeks. It was the main theme for Joel Schumacher&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;.
*&quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; by Michael Franks.
*The Sammarinese entry for the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv &quot;Spirit of the Night&quot; contains references to St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire.

<doc id="331569" wikidata="Q364138" url="?curid=331569" title="Happened-before">
<text>In computer science, the happened-before relation (denoted: formula_1) is a relation between the result of two events, such that if one event should happen before another event, the result must reflect that, even if those events are in reality executed out of order (usually to optimize program flow). This involves ordering events based on the potential causal relationship of pairs of events in a concurrent system, especially asynchronous distributed systems. It was formulated by Leslie Lamport.

The happened-before relation is formally defined as the least strict partial order on events such that:
* If events formula_2 and formula_3 occur on the same process, formula_4 if the occurrence of event formula_2 preceded the occurrence of event formula_3.
* If event formula_2 is the sending of a message and event formula_3 is the reception of the message sent in event formula_2, formula_4.

If two events happen in different isolated processes (that do not exchange messages directly or indirectly via third-party processes), then the two processes are said to be concurrent, that is neither formula_11 nor formula_12 is true. 

If there are other causal relationships between events in a given system, such as between the creation of a process and its first event, these relationships are also added to the definition.
For example, in some programming languages such as Java, C, C++ or Rust, a happens-before edge exists if memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B, that is, if statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read.

Like all strict partial orders, the happened-before relation is &quot;transitive&quot;, &quot;irreflexive&quot; (and vacuously, &quot;asymmetric&quot;), i.e.:
* formula_13, if formula_4 and formula_15, then formula_16 (transitivity). This means that for any three events formula_17, if formula_18 happened before formula_19, and formula_19 happened before formula_21, then formula_18 must have happened before formula_21.
* formula_24 (irreflexivity). This means that no event can happen before itself.
* formula_25 if formula_11 then formula_27 (asymmetry). This means that for any two events formula_28, if formula_18 happened before formula_19 then formula_19 cannot have happened before formula_18.

Let us observe that the asymmetry property directly follows from the previous properties: by contradiction, let us suppose that formula_25 we have formula_4 and formula_12. Then by transitivity we have formula_36 which contradicts irreflexivity.

The processes that make up a distributed system have no knowledge of the happened-before relation unless they use a logical clock, like a Lamport clock or a vector clock. This allows one to design algorithms for mutual exclusion, and tasks like debugging or optimising distributed systems.

<text>Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a platform for lab-on-a-chip systems that is based upon the manipulation of microdroplets. Droplets are dispensed, moved, stored, mixed, reacted, or analyzed on a platform with a set of insulated electrodes. Digital microfluidics can be used together with analytical analysis procedures such as mass spectrometry, colorimetry, electrochemical, and electrochemiluminescense.

== Overview ==

In analogy to digital microelectronics, digital microfluidic operations can be combined and reused within hierarchical design structures so that complex procedures (e.g. chemical synthesis or biological assays) can be built up step-by-step. And in contrast to continuous-flow microfluidics, digital microfluidics works much the same way as traditional bench-top protocols, only with much smaller volumes and much higher automation. Thus a wide range of established chemical procedures and protocols can be seamlessly transferred to a nanoliter droplet format. Electrowetting, dielectrophoresis, and immiscible-fluid flows are the three most commonly used principles, which have been used to generate and manipulate microdroplets in a digital microfluidic device.

A digital microfluidic (DMF) device set-up depends on the substrates used, the electrodes, the configuration of those electrodes, the use of a dielectric material, the thickness of that dielectric material, the hydrophobic layers, and the applied voltage.
A common substrate used in this type of system is glass. Depending if the system is open or closed, there would be either one or two layers of glass. The bottom layer of the device contains a patterned array of individually controllable electrodes. When looking at a closed system, there is usually a continuous ground electrode found through the top layer made usually of indium tin oxide (ITO). The dielectric layer is found around the electrodes in the bottom layer of the device and is important for building up charges and electrical field gradients on the device. A hydrophobic layer is applied to the top layer of the system to decrease the surface energy where the droplet will actually we be in contact with. The applied voltage activates the electrodes and allows changes in the wettability of droplet on the device’s surface. In order to move a droplet, a control voltage is applied to an electrode adjacent to the droplet, and at the same time, the electrode just under the droplet is deactivated. By varying the electric potential along a linear array of electrodes, electrowetting can be used to move droplets along this line of electrodes.

Modifications to this foundation can also be fabricated into the basic design structure. One example of this is the addition of electrochemiluminescence detectors within the indium tin oxide layer (the ground electrode in a closed system) which aid in the detection of luminophores in droplets. In general, different materials may also be used to replace basic components of a DMF system such as the use of PDMS instead of glass for the substrate. Liquid materials can be added, such as oil or another substance, to a closed system to prevent evaporation of materials and decrease surface contamination. Also, DMF systems can be compatible with ionic liquid droplets with the use of an oil in a closed device or with the use of a catena (a suspended wire) over an open DMF device.

Digital microfluidics can be light-activated. Optoelectrowetting can be used to transport sessile droplets around a surface containing patterned photoconductors. The photoelectrowetting effect can also be used to achieve droplet transport on a silicon wafer without the necessity of patterned electrodes.

== Working principle ==
Droplets are formed using the surface tension properties of a liquid. For example, water placed on a hydrophobic surface such as wax paper will form spherical droplets to minimize its contact with the surface. Differences in surface hydrophobicity affect a liquid’s ability to spread and ‘wet’ a surface by changing the contact angle. As the hydrophobicity of a surface increases, the contact angle increases, and the ability of the droplet to wet the surface decreases. The change in contact angle, and therefore wetting, is regulated by the Young-Lippmann equation.

formula_1

where formula_2 is the contact angle with an applied voltage formula_3; formula_4 is the contact angle with no voltage; formula_5 is the relative permittivity of the dielectric; formula_6 is the permittivity of free space; formula_7 is the liquid/filler media surface tension; formula_8 is the dielectric thickness.

In some cases, the hydrophobicity of a substrate can be controlled by using electrical fields. This refers to the phenomenon Electrowetting On Dielectric (EWOD).[3][4] For example, when no electric field is applied to an electrode, the surface will remain hydrophobic and a liquid droplet will form a more spherical droplet with a greater contact angle. When an electric field is applied, a polarized hydrophilic surface is created. The water droplet then becomes flattened and the contact angle decreases. By controlling the localization of this polarization, we can create an interfacial tension gradient that allows controlled displacement of the droplet across the surface of the DMF device.

== Droplet formation ==
There are two ways to make new droplets with a digital microfluidic device. Either an existing droplet can be split in two, or a new droplet can be made from a reservoir of material. Both processes are only known to work in closed devices, though this often is not a problem as the top plates of DMF devices are typically removable, so an open device can be made temporarily closed should droplet formation be necessary.
=== From an existing droplet ===
A droplet can be split by charging two electrodes on opposite sides of a droplet on an uncharged electrode. In the same way a droplet on an uncharged electrode will move towards an adjacent, charged electrode, this droplet will move towards both active electrodes. Liquid moves to either side, which causes the middle of the droplet to neck. For a droplet of the same size as the electrodes, splitting will occur approximately when formula_9, as the neck will be at its thinnest. formula_10 is the radius of curvature of the menisci at the neck, which is negative for a concave curve, and formula_11 is the radius of curvature of the menisci at the elongated ends of the droplet. This process is simple and consistently results in two droplets of equal volume.

The conventional method of splitting an existing droplet by simply turning the splitting electrodes on and off produces new droplets of relatively equal volume. However, the new droplets formed by the conventional method show considerable difference in volume. This difference is caused by local perturbations due to the rapid mass transport. Even though the difference is negligible in some applications, it can still pose a problem in applications that are highly sensitive to variations in volume, such as immunoassays and DNA amplification. To overcome the limitation of the conventional method, an existing droplet can be split by gradually changing the potential of the electrodes at the splitting region instead of simply switching them on and off. Using this method, a noticeable improvement in droplet volume variation, from around 10% variation in volume to less than 1% variation in volume, has been reported.

=== From a reservoir ===
Creating a new droplet from a reservoir of liquid can be done in a similar fashion to splitting a droplet. In this case, the reservoir remains stationary while a sequence of electrodes are used to draw liquid out of the reservoir. This drawn liquid and the reservoir form a neck of liquid, akin to the neck of a splitting droplet but longer, and the collapsing of this neck forms a dispensed droplet from the drawn liquid. In contrast to splitting, though, dispensing droplets in this manner is inconsistent in scale and results. There is no reliable distance liquid will need to be pulled from the reservoir for the neck to collapse, if it even collapses at all. Because this distance varies, the volumes of dispensed droplets will also vary within the same device.

Due to these inconsistencies, alternative techniques for dispensing droplets have been used and proposed, including drawing liquid out of reservoirs in geometries that force a thinner neck, using a continuous and replenishable electrowetting channel, and moving reservoirs into corners so as to cut the reservoir down the middle. Multiple iterations of the latter can produce droplets of more manageable sizes.

== Droplet manipulation ==

=== Droplet merging ===
As an existing droplet can be split to form discrete droplets using electrodes (see From an existing droplet), droplets can be merged into one droplet by electrodes as well. Utilizing the same concept applied for creating new droplets through splitting an existing droplet with electrodes, an aqueous droplet resting on an uncharged electrode can move towards a charged electrode where droplets will join and merge into one droplet. However, the merged droplet might not always form a circular shape even after the merging process is over due to surface tension. This problem can be solved by implementing a superhydrophobic surface between the droplets and the electrodes. Oil droplets can be merged in the same way as well, but oil droplets will move towards uncharged electrodes unlike aqueous droplets.

=== Droplet transportation ===
Discrete droplets can be transported in a highly controlled way using an array of electrodes. In the same way droplets move from an uncharged electrode to a charged electrode, or vice versa, droplets can be continuously transported along the electrodes by sequentially energizing the electrodes. Since droplet transportation involves an array of electrodes, multiple electrodes can be programmed to selectively apply a voltage to each electrode for a better control over transporting multiple droplets.

=== Displacement by electrostatic actuation ===
Three-dimensional droplet actuation has been made possible by implementing a closed system; this system contains a μL sized droplet in immiscible fluid medium. The droplet and medium are then sandwiched between two electromagnetic plates, creating an EM field between the two plates. The purpose of this method is to transfer the droplet from a lower planar surface to an upper parallel planar surface and back down via electrostatic forces. The physics behind such particle actuation and perpendicular movement can be understood from early works of N. N. Lebedev and I. P. Skal’skaya. In their research, they attempted to model the Maxwell electrical charge acquired by a perfectly round conducting particle in the presence of a uniform magnetic field caused by a perfectly-conducting and infinitely-stretching surface. Their model helps to predict the Z-direction motion of the microdroplets within the device as it points to the magnitude and direction of forces acting upon a micro droplet. This can be used to help accurately predict and correct for unwanted and uncontrollable particle movement. The model explains why failing to employ dielectric coating on one of the two surfaces causes reversal of charge within the droplet upon contact with each electrode and in turn causes the droplets to uncontrollably bounce of between electrodes.

Digital microfluidics (DMF), has already been readily adapted in many biological fields. By enabling three-dimensional movement within DMF, the technology can be used even more extensively in biological applications, as it could more accurately mimic 3-D microenvironments. A large benefit of employing this type of method is that it allows for two different environments to be accessible by the droplet, which can be taken advantage of by splitting the microfluidic tasks among the two surfaces. For example, while the lower plane can be used to move droplets, the upper plate can carry out the necessary chemical and/or biological processes. This advantage can be translated into practical experiment protocols in the biological community, such as coupling with DNA amplification. This also allows for the chip to be smaller, and to give researchers more freedom in designing platforms for microdroplet analysis.

=== All-terrain droplet actuation (ATDA) ===
All-terrain microfluidics is a method used to transport liquid droplets over non-traditional surface types. Unlike traditional microfluidics platform, which are generally restricted to planar and horizontal surfaces, ATDA enables droplet manipulation over curved, non-horizontal, and inverted surfaces. This is made possible by incorporating flexible thin sheets of copper and polyimide into the surface via a rapid prototyping method. This device works very well with many liquids, including aqueous buffers, solutions of proteins and DNA, and undiluted bovine serum. ATDA is compatible with silicone oil or pluronic additives, such as F-68, which reduce non-specific absorption and biofouling when dealing with biological fluids such as proteins, biological serums, and DNA. A drawback of a setup like this is accelerated droplet evaporation. ATDA is a form of open digital microfluidics, and as such the device needs to be encapsulated in a humidified environment in order to minimize droplet evaporation.

== Implementation ==

In one of various embodiments of EWOD-based microfluidic biochips, investigated first by Cytonix in 1987 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919134752/https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do;jsessionid=D05E82394F781CBA17DB0C5AC8E3C0B8?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=james&amp;PILastName=brown&amp;PIInstitution=cytonix&amp;PIState=MD&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=US&amp;RestrictExpired=on&amp;Search=Search#results |date=2020-09-19 }} and subsequently commercialized by Advanced Liquid Logic, there are two parallel glass plates. The bottom plate contains a patterned array of individually controllable electrodes and the top plate is coated with a continuous grounding electrode. A dielectric insulator coated with a hydrophobic is added to the plates to decrease the wet-ability of the surface and to add capacitance between the droplet and the control electrode. The droplet containing biochemical samples and the filler medium, such as the silicone oil, a fluorinated oil, or air, are sandwiched between the plates and the droplets travel inside the filler medium. In order to move a droplet, a control voltage is applied to an electrode adjacent to the droplet, and at the same time, the electrode just under the droplet is deactivated. By varying the electric potential along a linear array of electrodes, electrowetting can be used to move droplets along this line of electrodes.

== Applications ==

=== Laboratory automation ===
In research fields such as synthetic biology, where highly iterative experimentation is common, considerable efforts have been made to automate workflows. Digital microfluidics is often touted as a laboratory automation solution, with a number of advantages over alternative solutions such as pipetting robots and droplet microfluidics. These stated advantages often include a reduction in the required volume of experimental reagents, a reduction in the likelihood of contamination and cross-contamination, potential improvements in reproducibility, increased throughput, individual droplet addressability, and the ability to integrate with sensor and detector modules to perform end-to-end or even closed loop workflow automation.

==== Reduced experimental footprint ====
One of the core advantages of digital microfluidics, and of microfluidics in general, is the use and actuation of picoliter to microliter scale volumes. Workflows adapted from the bench to a DMF system are miniaturized, meaning working volumes are reduced to fractions of what is normally required for conventional methods. For example, Thaitrong et al. developed a DMF system with a capillary electrophoresis (CE) module with the purpose of automating the process of next generation sequencing (NGS) library characterization. Compared to an Agilent BioAnalyzer (an instrument commonly used to measure sequencing library size distribution), the DMF-CE system consumed ten-fold less sample volume. Reducing volumes for a workflow can be especially beneficial if the reagents are expensive or when manipulating rare samples such as circulating tumor cells and prenatal samples. Miniaturization also means a reduction in waste product volumes.

==== Reduced probability of contamination ====
DMF-based workflows, particularly those using a closed configuration with a top-plate ground electrode, have been shown to be less susceptible to outside contamination compared to some conventional laboratory workflows. This can be attributed to minimal user interaction during automated steps, and the fact that the smaller volumes are less exposed to environmental contaminants than larger volumes which would need to be exposed to open air during mixing. Ruan et al. observed minimal contamination from exogenous nonhuman DNA and no cross-contamination between samples while using their DMF-based digital whole genome sequencing system.

==== Improved reproducibility ====
Overcoming issues of reproducibility has become a topic of growing concern across scientific disciplines. Reproducibility can be especially salient when multiple iterations of the same experimental protocol need to be repeated. Using liquid handling robots that can minimize volume loss between experimental steps are often used to reduce error rates and improve reproducibility. An automated DMF system for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was described by Sinha et al, and was used to culture and genetically modify H1299 lung cancer cells. The authors noted that no variation in knockout efficiencies across loci was observed when cells were cultured on the DMF device, whereas cells cultured in well-plates showed variability in upstream loci knockout efficiencies. This reduction in variability was attributed to culturing on a DMF device being more homogenous and reproducible compared with well plate methods.

==== Increased throughput ====
While DMF systems cannot match the same throughput achieved by some liquid handling pipetting robots, or by some droplet-based microfluidic systems, there are still throughput advantages when compared to conventional methods carried out manually.

==== Individual droplet addressability ====
DMF allows for droplet level addressability, meaning individual droplets can be treated as spatially distinct microreactors. This level of droplet control is important for workflows where reactions are sensitive to the order of reagent mixing and incubation times, but where the optimal values of these parameters may still need to be determined. These types of workflows are common in cell-free biology, and Liu et al. were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept DMF-based strategy for carrying out remote-controlled cell-free protein expression on an OpenDrop chip.

==== Detector module integration for end-to-end and closed-loop automation ====
An often cited advantage DMF platforms have is their potential to integrate with on-chip sensors and off-chip detector modules. In theory, real-time and end-point data can be used in conjunction with machine learning methods to automate the process of parameter optimization.

=== Separation and extraction ===
Digital microfluidics can be used for separation and extraction of target analytes. These methods include the use of magnetic particles, liquid-liquid extraction, optical tweezers, and hydrodynamic effects.

==== Magnetic particles ====
For magnetic particle separations a droplet of solution containing the analyte of interest is placed on a digital microfluidics electrode array and moved by the changes in the charges of the electrodes. The droplet is moved to an electrode with a magnet on one side of the array with magnetic particles functionalized to bind to the analyte. Then it is moved over the electrode, the magnetic field is removed and the particles are suspended in the droplet. The droplet is swirled on the electrode array to ensure mixing. The magnet is reintroduced and the particles are immobilized and the droplet is moved away. This process is repeated with wash and elution buffers to extract the analyte.

Magnetic particles coated with antihuman serum albumin antibodies have been used to isolate human serum albumin, as proof of concept work for immunoprecipitation using digital microfluidics.5 DNA extraction from a whole blood sample has also been performed with digital microfluidics.3 The procedure follows the general methodology as the magnetic particles, but includes pre-treatment on the digital microfluidic platform to lyse the cells prior to DNA extraction.

==== Liquid-liquid extraction ====
Liquid-liquid extractions can be carried out on digital microfluidic device by taking advantage of immiscible liquids.9 Two droplets, one containing the analyte in aqueous phase, and the other an immiscible ionic liquid are present on the electrode array. The two droplets are mixed and the ionic liquid extracts the analyte, and the droplets are easily separable.

==== Optical tweezers ====
Optical tweezers have also been used to separate cells in droplets. Two droplets are mixed on an electrode array, one containing the cells, and the other with nutrients or drugs. The droplets are mixed and then optical tweezers are used to move the cells to one side of the larger droplet before it is split. For a more detailed explanation on the underlying principles, see Optical tweezers.

==== Hydrodynamic separation ====
Particles have been applied for use outside of magnetic separation, with hydrodynamic forces to separate particles from the bulk of a droplet. This is performed on electrode arrays with a central electrode and ‘slices’ of electrodes surrounding it. Droplets are added onto the array and swirled in a circular pattern, and the hydrodynamic forces from the swirling cause the particles to aggregate onto the central electrode.

=== Chemical synthesis ===
Digital Microfluidics (DMF) allows for precise manipulation and coordination in small-scale chemical synthesis reactions due to its ability to control micro scale volumes of liquid reagents, allowing for overall less reagent use and waste. This technology can be used in the synthesis compounds such as peptidomimetics and PET tracers. PET tracers require nanogram quantities and as such, DMF allows for automated and rapid synthesis of tracers with 90-95% efficiency compared to conventional macro-scale techniques.

Organic reagents are not commonly used in DMF because they tend to wet the DMF device and cause flooding; however synthesis of organic reagents can be achieved through DMF techniques by carrying the organic reagents through an ionic liquid droplet, thus preventing the organic reagent from flooding the DMF device. Droplets are combined together by inducing opposite charges thus attracting them to each other. This allows for automated mixing of droplets. Mixing of droplets are also used to deposit MOF crystals for printing by delivering reagents into wells and evaporating the solutions for crystal deposition. This method of MOF crystal deposition is relatively cheap and does not require extensive robotic equipment.

Chemical synthesis using digital microfluidics (DMF) has been applied to many noteworthy biological reactions. These include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as the formation of DNA and peptides. Reduction, alkylation, and enzymatic digestion have also shown robustness and reproducibility utilizing DMF, indicating potential in the synthesis and manipulation of proteomics. Spectra obtained from the products of these reactions are often identical to their library spectra, while only utilizing a small fraction of bench-scale reactants. Thus, conducting these syntheses on the microscale has the benefit of limiting money spent on purchasing reagents and waste products produced while yielding desirable experimental results. However, numerous challenges need to be overcome to push these reactions to completion through DMF. There have been reports of reduced efficiency in chemical reactions as compared to bench-scale versions of the same syntheses, as lower product yields have been observed. Furthermore, since picoliter and nanoliter size samples must be analyzed, any instrument used in analysis needs to be high in sensitivity. In addition, system setup is often difficult due to extensive amounts of wiring and pumps that are required to operate microchannels and reservoirs. Finally, samples are often subject to solvent evaporation which leads to changes in volume and concentration of reactants, and in some cases reactions to not go to completion.

The composition and purity of molecules synthesized by DMF are often determined utilizing classic analytical techniques. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been successfully applied to analyze corresponding intermediates, products, and reaction kinetics. A potential issue that arises through the use of NMR is low mass sensitivity, however this can be corrected for by employing microcoils that assist in distinguishing molecules of differing masses. This is necessary since the signal-to-noise ratio of sample sizes in the microliter to nanoliter range is dramatically reduced compared to bench-scale sample sizes, and microcoils have been shown to resolve this issue. Mass spectrometry (MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have also been used to overcome this challenge. Although MS is an attractive analytical technique for distinguishing the products of reactions accomplished through DMF, it poses its own weaknesses. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have recently been paired with analyzing microfluidic chemical reactions. However, crystallization and dilution associated with these methods often leads to unfavorable side effects, such as sample loss and side reactions occurring. The use of MS in DMF is discussed in more detail in a later section.

=== Cell culture ===
Connecting the DMF chip to use in the field or world-to-chip interfaces have been accomplished by means of manual pumps and reservoirs which deliver microbes, cells, and media to the device. The lack of extensive pumps and valves allow for elaborate multi step applications involving cells performed in a simple and compact system. In one application, microbial cultures have been transferred onto the chip and allowed to grow with the use of sterile procedures and temperature required for microbial incubation. To validate that this was a viable space for microbial growth, a transformation assay was carried out in the device. This involves exposing E.coli to a vector and heat shocking the bacteria until they take up the DNA. This is then followed by running a DNA gel to assure that the wanted vector was taken up by the bacteria. This study found that the DNA indeed was taken up by the bacteria and expressed as predicted.

Human cells have also been manipulated in Digital Microfluidic Immunocytochemistry in Single Cells (DISC) where DMF platforms were used to culture and use antibodies to label phosphorylated proteins in the cell. Cultured cells are then removed and taken off chip for screening. Another technique synthesizes hydrogels within DMF platforms. This process uses electrodes to deliver reagents to produce the hydrogel, and delivery of cell culture reagents for absorption into the gel. The hydrogels are an improvement over 2D cell culture because 3D cell culture have increased cell-cell interactions and cel-extracellular matrix interactions. Spherical cell cultures are another method developed around the ability of DMF to deliver droplets to cells. Application of an electric potential allows for automation of droplet transfer directly to the hanging cell culture.] This is beneficial as 3 dimensional cell culture and spheroids better mimic in vivo tissue by allowing for more biologically relevant cultures that have cells growing in an extracellular matrix similarly resembling that in the human body. Another use of DMF platforms in cell culture is its ability to conduct &quot;in vitro&quot; cell-free cloning using single molecule PCR inside droplets. PCR amplified products are then validated by transfection into yeast cells and a Western blot protein identification.

Problems arising from cell culture applications using DMF include protein adsorption to the device floor, and cytotoxicity to cells. To prevent adsorption of protein to the platform&#x27;s floor, a surfactant stabilized Silicon oil or hexane was used to coat the surface of the device, and droplets were manipulated atop of the oil or hexane. Hexane was later rapidly evaporated from cultures to prevent a toxic effect on cell cultures. Another approach to solve protein adhesion is the addition of Pluronic additives to droplets in the device. Pluronic additives are generally not cytotoxic but some have been shown to be harmful to cell cultures.

Bio-compatibility of device set up is important for biological analyses. Along with finding Pluronic additives that are not cytotoxic, creating a device whose voltage and disruptive movement would not affect cell viability was accomplished. Through the readout of live/dead assays it was shown that neither voltage required to move droplets, nor the motion of moving cultures affected cell viability.

==== Biological extraction ====
Biological separations usually involve low concentration high volume samples. This can pose an issue for digital microfluidics due to the small sample volume necessary. Digital microfluidic systems can be combined with a macrofluidic system designed to decrease sample volume, in turn increasing analyte concentration. It follows the same principles as the magnetic particles for separation, but includes pumping of the droplet to cycle a larger volume of fluid around the magnetic particles.
Extraction of drug analytes from dried urine samples has also been reported. A droplet of extraction solvent, in this case methanol, is repeatedly flowed over a sample of dried urine sample then moved to a final electrode where the liquid is extracted through a capillary and then analyzed using mass spectrometry.

==== Immunoassays ====
The advanced fluid handling capabilities of digital microfluidics (DMF) allows for the adoption of DMF as an immunoassay platform as DMF devices can precisely manipulate small quantities of liquid reagents. Both heterogeneous immunoassays (antigens interacting with immobilized antibodies) and homogeneous immunoassays (antigens interacting with antibodies in solution) have been developed using a DMF platform. With regards to heterogeneous immunoassays, DMF can simplify the extended and intensive procedural steps by performing all delivery, mixing, incubation, and washing steps on the surface of the device (on-chip). Further, existing immunoassay techniques and methods, such as magnetic bead-based assays, ELISAs, and electrochemical detection, have been incorporated onto DMF immunoassay platforms.

The incorporation of magnetic bead-based assays onto a DMF immunoassay platform has been demonstrated for the detection of multiple analytes, such as human insulin, , cardiac marker Troponin I (cTnI), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), sTNF-RI, and 17β-estradiol. For example, a magnetic bead-based approached has been used for the detection of cTnI from whole blood in less than 8 minutes. Briefly, magnetic beads containing primary antibodies were mixed with labeled secondary antibodies, incubated, and immobilized with a magnet for the washing steps. The droplet was then mixed with a chemiluminescent reagent and detection of the accompanying enzymatic reaction was measured on-chip with a photomultiplier tube.

The ELISA template, commonly used for performing immunoassays and other enzyme-based biochemical assays, has been adapted for use with the DMF platform for the detection of analytes such as IgE and IgG. In one example, a series of bioassays were conducted to establish the quantification capabilities of DMF devices, including an ELISA-based immunoassay for the detection of IgE. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles were immobilized with anti-IgE antibodies and fluorescently labeled aptamers to quantify IgE using an ELISA template. Similarly, for the detection of IgG, IgG can be immobilized onto a DMF chip, conjugated with horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-labeled IgG, and then quantified through measurement of the color change associated with product formation of the reaction between HRP and tetramethylbenzidine.

To further expand the capabilities and applications of DMF immunoassays beyond colorimetric detection (i.e., ELISA, magnetic bead-based assays), electrochemical detection tools (e.g., microelectrodes) have been incorporated into DMF chips for the detection of analytes such as TSH and rubella virus. For example, Rackus et al. integrated microelectrodes onto a DMF chip surface and substituted a previously reported chemiluminescent IgG immunoassay with an electroactive species, enabling detection of rubella virus. They coated magnetic beads with rubella virus, anti-rubella IgG, and anti-human IgG coupled with alkaline phosphatase, which in turn catalyzed an electron transfer reaction that was detected by the on-chip microelectrodes.

=== Mass spectrometry ===
The coupling of digital microfluidics (DMF) and Mass Spectrometry can largely be categorized into indirect off-line analysis, direct off-line analysis, and in-line analysis and the main advantages of this coupling are decreased solvent and reagent use, as well as decreased analysis times.

Indirect off-line analysis is the usage of DMF devices to combine reactants and isolate products, which are then removed and manually transferred to a mass spectrometer. This approach takes advantage of DMF for the sample preparation step but also introduces opportunities for contamination as manual intervention is required to transfer the sample. In one example of this technique, a Grieco three-component condensation was carried out on chip and was taken off the chip by micropipette for quenching and further analysis.

Direct off-line analysis is the usage of DMF devices that have been fabricated and incorporated partially or totally into a mass spectrometer. This process is still considered off-line, however as some post-reaction procedures may be carried out manually (but on chip), without the use of the digital capabilities of the device. Such devices are most often used in conjugation with MALDI-MS. In MALDI-based direct off-line devices, the droplet must be dried and recrystallized along with matrix – operations that oftentimes require vacuum chambers. The chip with crystallized analyte is then placed in to the MALDI-MS for analysis. One issue raised with MALDI-MS coupling to DMF is that the matrix necessary for MALDI-MS can be highly acidic, which may interfere with the on-chip reactions

Inline analysis is the usage of devices that feed directly into mass spectrometers, thereby eliminating any manual manipulation. Inline analysis may require specially fabricated devices and connecting hardware between the device and the mass spectrometer. Inline analysis is often coupled with electrospray ionization. In one example, a DMF chip was fabricated with a hole that led to a microchannel This microchannel was, in turn, connected to an electrospray ionizer that emitted directly into a mass spectrometer. Integration ambient ionization techniques where ions are formed outside of the mass spectrometer with little or no treatment pairs well with the open or semi-open microfluidic nature of DMF and allows easy inline couping between DMF and MS systems. Ambient Ionization techniques such as Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) ionization generate surface waves on a flat piezoelectric surface that imparts enough acoustic energy on the liquid interface to overcome surface tension and desorb ions off the chip into the mass analyzer. Some couplings utilize an external high-voltage pulse source at the physical inlet to the mass spectrometer but the true role of such additions is uncertain.

A significant barrier to the widespread integration of DMF with mass spectrometry is biological contamination, often termed bio-fouling. High throughput analysis is a significant advantage in the use of DMF systems, but means that they are particularly susceptible to cross contamination between experiments. As a result, the coupling of DMF with mass spectrometry often requires the integration of a variety of methods to prevent cross contamination such as multiple washing steps, biologically compatible surfactants, and or super hydrophobic surfaces to prevent droplet adsorption. In one example, a reduction in cross contaminant signal during the characterization of an amino acid required 4-5 wash steps between each sample droplet for the contamination intensity to fall below the limit of detection.

==== Miniature Mass Spectrometers ====
Conventional mass spectrometers are often large as well as prohibitively expensive and complex in their operation which has led to the increased attractiveness of miniature mass spectrometers (MMS) for a variety of applications. MMS are optimized towards affordability and simple operation, often forgoing the need for experienced technicians, having a low cost of manufacture, and being small enough in size to allow for the transfer of data collection from the laboratory into the field. These advantages often come at the cost of reduced performance where MMS resolution, as well as the limits of detection and quantitation, are often barely adequate to perform specialized tasks. The integration of DMF with MMS has the potential for significant improvement of MMS systems by increasing throughput, resolution, and automation, while decreasing solvent cost, enabling lab grade analysis at a much reduced cost. In one example the use of a custom DMF system for urine drug testing enabled the creation of an instrument weighing only 25 kg with performance comparable to standard laboratory analysis.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy===

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used in conjunction with digital microfluidics (DMF) through the use of NMR microcoils, which are electromagnetic conducting coils that are less than 1 mm in size. Due to their size, these microcoils have several limitations, directly influencing the sensitivity of the machinery they operate within.

Microchannel/microcoil interfaces, previous to digital microfluidics, had several drawbacks such as in that many created large amounts of solvent waste and were easily contaminated. In this way, the use of digital microfluidics and its capability to manipulate singlet droplets is promising.

The interface between digital microfluidics and NMR relaxometry has led to the creation of systems such as those used to detect and quantify the concentrations of specific molecules on microscales with some such systems using two step processes in which DMF devices guide droplets to the NMR detection site. Introductory systems of high-field NMR and 2D NMR in conjunction with microfluidics have also been developed. These systems use single plate DMF devices with NMR microcoils in place of the second plate. Recently, further modified version of this interface included pulsed field gradients (PFG) units that enabled this platform to perform more sophisticated NMR measurements (e.g. NMR diffusometry, gradients encoded pulse measurements). This system has been successfully applied into monitoring rapid organic reactions.

<doc id="331582" wikidata="Q115962" url="?curid=331582" title="David Coverdale">
<text>David Coverdale (born 22 September 1951) is an English singer and songwriter best known as the founder and lead singer of the hard rock band Whitesnake. He was also the lead singer of Deep Purple from 1973 to 1976, after which he released two solo studio albums, &quot;White Snake&quot; (1977) and &quot;Northwinds&quot; (1978), before forming Whitesnake in 1978. 

During a Whitesnake hiatus from 1991 to 1993, he collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; album, which was subsequently certified platinum. In 1997 studio album &quot;Restless Heart&quot; was initially intended to be released as a solo album, but in the end was released under moniker of &quot;David Coverdale &amp; Whitesnake&quot;. In 2000, Coverdale released his third studio album &quot;Into the Light&quot;.

In 2016, Coverdale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple. Coverdale is known in particular for his powerful, blues-tinged voice. He has sold a cumulative 40 million copies throughout his career.

== Early life ==
Coverdale was born on 22 September 1951 in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, near Redcar, North Riding of Yorkshire, England, son of Thomas Joseph Coverdale and Winnifred May (Roberts) Coverdale. According to Coverdale, his maternal side and mother &quot;were the singers&quot;, while paternal side &quot;were the painters, the sketchers, the artists&quot;. He was initiated into music at his maternal grandmother&#x27;s place and school, at an early age started learning to play guitar and piano, but drawing was his primary medium of expression. 

From the beginning Coverdale showed singing talent and &quot;discovered that he could project&quot; and had a &quot;gut voice&quot;. Around the age of 14, he began performing professionally and developing his voice. &quot;I don&#x27;t think my voice had broken&quot;, he explained to &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1974. &quot;And that&#x27;s when I first learnt how to sing with my stomach, which sounds silly, but it&#x27;s totally different from a normal voice&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
==== Deep Purple (1973–1976) ====
Coverdale started his career performing with local bands Vintage 67 (1966–1968), The Government (1968–1972), and Fabulosa Brothers (1972–1973). By 1973 he left art college and was successfully working as a &quot;singing salesman&quot;, until he saw an article in a copy of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, which said that Deep Purple was auditioning for singers to replace Ian Gillan. Coverdale had fronted a local group called the Government, which had played with Deep Purple on the same bill in 1969, so he and the band were familiar with one another, and after sending a tape and later auditioning, Coverdale was admitted into the band due to &quot;his singing and songwriting talents&quot;, with new bassist Glenn Hughes also providing vocals with Coverdale.

In February 1974, Deep Purple released their first album with Coverdale and Hughes, titled &quot;Burn&quot;, which was certified Gold in the United States on 20 March 1974, and in the UK on 1 July. In April 1974 Coverdale and Deep Purple performed to over 200,000 fans on his first trip to the United States at the California Jam. In December 1974, &quot;Burn&quot; was followed-up by &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, which also ranked at Gold album status in the US and the UK. The funk and soul influences of the previous record were even more prominent here and this was one of the reasons why guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left the band in June 1975.
Rather than disbanding, Coverdale was instrumental in persuading the band to continue with American guitarist Tommy Bolin (of Billy Cobham and James Gang fame). As Jon Lord put it, &quot;David Coverdale came up to me and said, &#x27;Please keep the band together.&#x27; David played me the album that Tommy did with Billy Cobham. We liked his playing on it and invited Tommy to audition.&#x27;&quot; The band released one studio album with Bolin, &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot; in 1975, which was less commercially successful than previous records. The supporting tour proved difficult, with both Hughes and Bolin having drug habits. In March 1976, at the end of the final show of the tour, Coverdale reportedly walked off in tears and handed in his resignation, to which he was told there was no band left to quit. The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Ian Paice (the last remaining original members), who had not told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. Coverdale said in an interview: &quot;I was frightened to leave the band. Purple was my life, Purple gave me my break, but all the same I wanted out.&quot;

==== Solo efforts &quot;White Snake&quot; and &quot;Northwinds&quot; (1977–1978) ====
After the demise of Deep Purple, Coverdale embarked on a solo career. In the wake of the punk movement, he stayed true to his blues rock roots. He released his first solo studio album in February 1977, titled &quot;White Snake&quot;. All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody, and the music shows funk, R&amp;B and jazz influences. As his first solo effort, Coverdale later said: &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to think back and talk sensibly about the first album. &quot;White Snake&quot; had been a very inward-looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded as it was in the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple.&quot; Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale&#x27;s future band. 

In 1978, Coverdale released his second studio album &quot;Northwinds&quot;. Its &quot;blues- and R&amp;B-influenced hard rock&quot; style was received much better than the previous album, and in 2021 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; considered it &quot;a remarkably mature album that can still send shivers down the spine 30 years after it was recorded&quot; and the &quot;antithesis of Whitesnake&#x27;s super-slick &quot;1987&quot;&quot;. Before the album&#x27;s release, he had already formed a new band.

==== Early Whitesnake era (1978–1982) ====

After recording &quot;Northwinds&quot;, Coverdale soon formed the band Whitesnake, with Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody both handling guitar duties. Although this was originally a touring band for Coverdale&#x27;s first solo album, it soon developed into a full-time band. In early 1978, the band released an EP titled &quot;Snakebite&quot;, which was later expanded into a full album, also titled &quot;Snakebite&quot;, released in June 1978, with the EP on side one and select tracks from Coverdale&#x27;s &quot;Northwinds&quot; album on side two. For the follow-up album, &quot;Trouble&quot;, Coverdale was joined by his former Deep Purple colleague, keyboardist Jon Lord. For Whitesnake&#x27;s 1980 album, &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;, another Deep Purple member, drummer Ian Paice, joined the group. &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; also featured the band&#x27;s biggest hit up to that point, the song &quot;Fool for Your Loving&quot;, which reached No. 13 on the British charts, and No. 53 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; was followed up by the even more successful &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; in 1981. Coverdale put Whitesnake on hold during part of 1982, to make time for the treatment and care of his sick daughter. When the time was right to return, he reformed the band, which thereafter recorded the album &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot;. Also in 1982, Coverdale was considered for the vocalist position with Black Sabbath following the departure of Ronnie James Dio, but he declined because of Whitesnake.

=== Breakthrough ===
==== International success of Whitesnake (1983–1991) ====

Whitesnake gained significant popularity in the UK, Europe, and Asia, but North American success remained elusive. In 1984, the album &quot;Slide It In&quot; dented the US charts (reaching #40), but not enough to be considered a hit. In time for the US release of &quot;Slide It In&quot;, Coverdale made a calculated attempt at updating Whitesnake&#x27;s sound and look by recruiting guitarist John Sykes from the remnants of Thin Lizzy. Sykes brought a more contemporary, aggressive guitar sound with him and had stage manners to match. The last remaining Deep Purple connections were severed when Jon Lord left after recording &quot;Slide It In&quot; to re-form Deep Purple (Ian Paice had left Whitesnake in 1982).

In 1985, Sykes and Coverdale started working on new songs for the next album, but Coverdale soon contracted a serious sinus infection that made recording close to impossible for much of 1986 and which had doctors thinking he might never sing again. Coverdale eventually recovered, and recordings were continued. Before their upcoming album was fully recorded and released, Coverdale had dismissed Sykes from the band. In many period interviews, Coverdale stated that the next album was a make-or-break album for Whitesnake, and if not successful he would disband Whitesnake altogether. During 1987 and 1988, North America was finally won over with the multi-platinum self-titled &quot;Whitesnake&quot; album. Propelled by hit singles such as &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot;, as well as MTV airing of &quot;Still of the Night&quot;, it finally made Whitesnake a &quot;bona fide arena headliner&quot; in North America. 

Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, caught in the &quot;hair-band&quot; era, Coverdale kept Whitesnake going with great success despite changing line-ups. In 1989, Coverdale recruited Vandenberg to record a new album, &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot;. Vandenberg co-wrote the entire album with Coverdale, but a wrist injury sidelined him from contributing the solo guitar work. Steve Vai was recruited, re-recording most of Vandenberg&#x27;s existing parts and finishing the album. Upon release, it also was a success in Europe and the US, but it &quot;was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of &quot;Whitesnake&quot;&quot;. 
In 1990, Coverdale sang and co-wrote (with Hans Zimmer and Billy Idol) the song &quot;The Last Note of Freedom&quot; for the Tony Scott film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. On 26 September 1990, after the last show on the &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; tour in Tokyo, Coverdale disbanded Whitesnake indefinitely. Tired of the business in general, the rigors of touring and troubled by his separation and later divorce from Tawny Kitaen, Coverdale wanted to find other values in life and took &quot;private time to reflect&quot; and re-assess his career direction.

At that point Coverdale had grown uncomfortable with the entity he believed Whitesnake had become, and admitted that he got &quot;caught up in it&quot;. In a 1993 interview with Robert Hilburn he commented that he &quot;had to stop everything, this whole circus. I had never gone into (music) for the image thing at all, and I really couldn&#x27;t do it anymore&quot;. In one early 90s interview, Coverdale recalled &quot;it got louder and louder, and so did I, to the point now where I have to get dressed up like a &quot;girly man&quot; and tease one&#x27;s questionable bangs or hair and it&#x27;s all becoming a bit ... boring&quot;.

==== Coverdale and Page (1991–1993) ====
In the early spring of 1991, a collaboration was set up with guitarist Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame. Both parties have said that the collaboration revitalised them on many levels. This collaboration resulted in the &quot;Coverdale-Page&quot; album released in March 1993. The album was a hit worldwide, reaching number four in the UK and number five in the US, and was certified Platinum in the US on 7 April 1995. The US tour for the album had to be cancelled due to slow ticket sales, but held a limited Japanese arena tour before they parted ways and Page soon started collaborating again with Robert Plant.

=== Later years ===
==== Return of Whitesnake and &quot;Restless Heart&quot; (1994, 1997–1998) ====
In 1994, Coverdale assembled a new line-up of Whitesnake (with the exception of Coverdale&#x27;s musical partner, guitarist Adrian Vandenberg and bassist Rudy Sarzo, both of whom had been in Whitesnake since 1987) to tour for the release of Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. After this Coverdale once again retreated from the music business, for three years. 

In 1997 Coverdale returned and released &quot;Restless Heart&quot; (with Vandenberg on guitar). The album was originally supposed to be Coverdale&#x27;s solo album, but in the end the record company forced it to be released under the moniker &quot;David Coverdale &amp; Whitesnake&quot;. The tour was billed as Whitesnake&#x27;s farewell tour, during which Coverdale and Vandenberg played two unplugged shows, one in Japan and the other for VH1. The first of the two shows was released the next year under the title &quot;Starkers in Tokyo&quot;. After the Restless Heart-tour ended, Coverdale once again folded Whitesnake and took another short break from music.

==== Back to solo and &quot;Into the Light&quot; (1999–2002) ====
In 2000, Coverdale released his first solo studio album in 22 years, titled &quot;Into The Light&quot;, with singles &quot;Love is Blind&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;. Even though the album was not a commercial hit, it is his most successful solo album both commercially and critically, with the song &quot;River Song&quot; receiving most notoriety, and did return Coverdale to the music business. In 2003 the compilation album &quot;The Early Years&quot; was released, including his two studio albums &quot;White Snake&quot; and &quot;Northwinds&quot; from the 1970s.

==== Re-reformation of Whitesnake (2003–present) ====
In December 2002, Coverdale re-reformed Whitesnake for an American tour with the Scorpions in early 2003, with Tommy Aldridge on drums, Marco Mendoza (bass), Doug Aldrich (guitar), Reb Beach (ex-Winger guitarist) and keyboardist Timothy Drury. They were also performing on the Rock Never Stops Tour in the same year.

In April 2008, the band released its first new studio album in over 11 years titled &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; to great success. On 11 August 2009 Whitesnake were playing a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado when Coverdale suffered some kind of vocal injury. After seeing a specialist, it was announced on 12 August 2009 that Coverdale had been suffering from severe vocal fold edema and a left vocal fold vascular lesion. The remainder of the tour with Judas Priest was cancelled so that this injury would not worsen. In March 2011 the band released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Forevermore&quot;. 

In May 2015, the band released &quot;The Purple Album&quot;, featuring cover versions of the songs that Coverdale had originally performed with Deep Purple. It was followed by a tour. In May 2019, the band released new studio album &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;.

In 2022, the band began their COVID-delayed farewell tour with European dates kicking off in Dublin on 10 May 2022, but were able to continue only until their date in Croatia on 2 July 2022. After cancelling the last 11 dates of the European leg of the tour due to health problems affecting various band members including Reb Beach, Tommy Aldridge and Coverdale himself, Whitesnake subsequently cancelled the entire 2022 North American leg of its Farewell Tour as Coverdale was forced to deal with ongoing respiratory health issues.

In 2024, a compilation, &quot;Into the Light: The Solo Albums&quot;, was released, containing new mixes and remasters of all Coverdale&#x27;s solo albums under the Whitesnake name.

== Legacy ==
In 2006, hard rock/heavy metal magazine &quot;Hit Parader&quot; named Coverdale as No. 54 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. In 2009, he was voted as sixth out of 40 contenders for &quot;the greatest voice in rock&quot; in a poll conducted by UK classic rock radio station Planet Rock. 

In 2003 &quot;PopMatters&quot; proclaimed him as the &quot;crown prince of &#x27;70s rock. Not even Plant, definitely not Bad Company&#x27;s Paul Rodgers, or anyone else can touch Coverdale at this moment in time when it comes to rock icons from that era — it&#x27;s just a shame that hardly anyone comes to see it&quot;. In 2015, Dave Everley of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; considered that &quot;Whitesnake are one of the great British bands of the past 40 years, and Coverdale is one of the finest blue-eyed soul singers, full-stop&quot;. William Pinfold in &quot;Record Collector&quot;&#x27;s review of Martin Popoff&#x27;s 2015 biography on Whitesnake commented that both the band and Coverdale &quot;have been consistently taken seriously&quot; but &quot;are underrated compared with the plaudits given to their 70s/80s peers&quot;, considering Coverdale &quot;outrageously talented, charismatic and in equal parts lordly and humble, he&#x27;s a hugely likeable figure&quot;.

In 2016, Coverdale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple.

== Personal life ==
Coverdale was married from 1974 to 1982 to Julia Borkowski from Poland, and their daughter Jessica was born in 1978. 
Coverdale&#x27;s second marriage was to former model and actress Tawny Kitaen, from 17 February 1989 until they divorced two years later, in April 1991. Kitaen was known for her provocative appearances in Whitesnake&#x27;s music videos for &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and &quot;Still of the Night&quot;. 
Since marrying on 30 May 1997, he has lived with his third wife, Cindy, an author (&quot;The Food That Rocks&quot;); they have one son.

On 1 March 2007, Coverdale became a US citizen, in a ceremony in Reno, Nevada, and now holds dual UK citizenship and US. For many years in the 1980s he lived in hotels, including the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles. Since 1988 he has lived on almost 10,000 sq ft estate in Incline Village, Nevada at Lake Tahoe where he built a luxurious house. In 2019 he decided to sell it, and in 2021 it was reportedly sold for $6.8 million.

A more spiritual than religious person, Coverdale since late 1960s is regularly practising meditation and considers it &quot;the most incredible accessory or tool that I&#x27;ve found in my life&quot;.

<text>Crocodile Dundee is a 1986 action comedy film set in the Australian Outback and in New York City. It stars Paul Hogan as the weathered Mick Dundee and American actress Linda Kozlowski as reporter Sue Charlton. Inspired by the true-life exploits of Rod Ansell, the film was made on a budget of under $10 million as a deliberate attempt to make a commercial Australian film that would appeal to a mainstream American audience, but proved to be a worldwide phenomenon.

Released on 30 April 1986 in Australia, and on 26 September in the United States, it was the highest-grossing film of all time in Australia, the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide, the second-highest-grossing film in the United States in 1986, the highest-grossing non-US film at the US box office ever and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide for the year. There are two versions of the film: the Australian version, and an international version, which had much of the Australian slang replaced with more commonly understood terms, and was slightly shorter. As the first film in the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; film series, it was followed by two sequels: &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; (1988) and &quot;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&quot; (2001), although both films failed to match the critical success of the original.

==Plot==
Sue Charlton is a feature writer for her father&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot;, and is dating the editor Richard Mason. She travels to Walkabout Creek, a small township in the Northern Territory of Australia, to meet Michael J. &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee, a bushman reported to have lost half a leg to a saltwater crocodile before crawling hundreds of miles to safety. On arrival in Walkabout Creek, she cannot locate Dundee, but she is entertained at the local pub by Dundee&#x27;s business partner Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Reilly. When Dundee arrives that night, Sue finds his leg is not missing, but he has a large scar which he refers to as a &quot;love bite&quot;. While Sue dances with Dundee, a group of city kangaroo shooters make fun of Dundee&#x27;s status as a crocodile hunter, causing him to knock the leader out with one punch.

At first, Sue finds Dundee less &quot;legendary&quot; than she had been led to believe, unimpressed by his pleasant-mannered but uncouth behaviour and clumsy advances towards her. She is later amazed when, in the Outback, she witnesses &quot;Mick&quot; (as Dundee is called) subduing a water buffalo, taking part in an Aboriginal (Pitjantjatjara) tribal dance ceremony, killing a snake with his bare hands, and scaring away the kangaroo shooters by tricking them into thinking one of the kangaroos is shooting back.

The next morning, offended by Mick&#x27;s assertion that as a &quot;&quot; she is incapable of surviving the Outback alone, Sue goes out alone to prove him wrong but takes his rifle with her at his request. Mick follows her to make sure she is okay, but when she stops at a billabong to fill her canteen with water, she is attacked by a large crocodile and is rescued by Mick. Overcome with gratitude, Sue finds herself becoming attracted to him.

Sue invites Mick to return with her to New York City on the pretext of continuing the feature story. At first Wally scoffs at her suggestion, but he changes his mind when she tells him the newspaper would cover all expenses. Once in New York, Mick is perplexed by local behaviour and customs but overcomes problematic situations including encounters with a pimp and attempted robberies. After this Sue realises her true feelings for him, and they kiss.

At a society dinner at her father&#x27;s home in honour of Sue&#x27;s safe return and of Mick&#x27;s visit, Richard proposes marriage to Sue, and in a haze of confused emotions, she initially accepts in spite of Richard&#x27;s having recently revealed his self-centered and insensitive &quot;true colours&quot; during a period of intoxication.

Mick, disheartened at Sue&#x27;s engagement, decides to go &quot;walkabout&quot; around the United States, but Sue has a change of heart and, deciding not to marry Richard, follows Mick to a subway station. There, she cannot reach him through the crowd on the platform, but has members of the crowd relay her message to him, whereupon he climbs up to the rafters and walks to Sue on the heads and raised hands of the onlookers and kisses her, to the delight of the crowd, where they receive a round of applause.

==Cast==
==Production==
The idea to make the film came to Paul Hogan (the lead actor and one of the story writers) when he was in New York. He wondered what it would be like if a Northern Territory bushman arrived in town. As Paul Hogan said:
The film&#x27;s budget was raised through the 10BA tax concessions via Morgan Sharebrokers. Paul Hogan used his regular collaborators from TV, including John Cornell, Peter Faiman and Ken Shadie. Linda Kozlowski was imported to play the American reporter; Actors&#x27; Equity Australia objected to this but eventually relented.

Principal photography began on 13 July 1985. The first scenes were filmed in the small town of McKinlay in Queensland, where the hotel used has original warped and polished hardwood floors. Production decided to shoot in Kakadu National Park at the end of the dry season since crocodiles were less active in the filming locations. Areas such as Gunlom Falls, also known as the UDP Falls back in the 1980s, are also featured in the movie. The crocodile attack scene was filmed in Girraween Lagoon, just out of Darwin. Six weeks of filming were spent working out of Jaja, an abandoned uranium mining camp in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory with an additional week in Cloncurry. There was a further six weeks filming in New York City (including Newark Liberty International Airport, which serves the city). Filming wrapped on 11 October 1985.

When the filming finished, Hogan said he expected it would make millions of dollars around the world. Hogan also said of the film: &quot;I&#x27;m planning for it to be Australia&#x27;s first proper movie. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve had one yet—not a real, general public, successful, entertaining movie&quot;. &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; was offered to 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. for North American release before Paramount picked it up for US$6 million.

==Release==

The film was originally released on 30 April 1986 in Australia, and on 26 September 1986 in the United States.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS in the United Kingdom by CBS Fox Video on 24 September 1987 and sold a record 62,000 copies, generating a gross profit of £2.7 million (US$4.3 million).

===Television broadcasts===
&quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; remains the single most-viewed Christmas Day film or programme in the United Kingdom when it debuted on 25 December 1989 on BBC One, with an audience of 21.8 million.

===&quot;The Encore Cut&quot;===

In January 2025, a version of the film subtitled &quot;The Encore Cut&quot; premiered in Sydney, ahead of a wider theatrical release in May. Along with a 4K remaster, the film received a number of edits including the inclusion of a text land acknowledgement at the top of the film, extended scenes in Kakadu, and the removal of scenes that could be considered transphobic and homophobic. Production company Rimfire Films stated that the edits to the film were made at the request of Paramount Pictures. &quot;The Encore Cut&quot; will become the standard version for future releases.

Hogan defended &quot;The Encore Cut&quot;, arguing &quot;it wasn’t about being woke...it’s better without [those scenes]&quot;. Faiman possessed a mixed response, arguing that while re-edits to films are not unprecedented, &quot;I think that screwing around with history, in the arts particularly, is not a good idea.&quot; &quot;The Encore Cut&quot; received criticism from some fans and media outlets, including &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;Seven News&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a sleeper hit, grossing US$328 million and surpassing &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; as the highest-grossing Australian film at the worldwide box office.

&quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; opened with a record A$2,047,026 in its first week in Australia. It went on to gross A$47,707,045 at the box office in Australia and was the highest-grossing film of all time there after 11 weeks, surpassing &quot;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. It was also the highest-grossing film of all-time in New Zealand, with a gross of $5.1 million.

A number of minor changes were made to the film for its US release, where it was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures in September 1986. The film debuted at number one, grossing US$8 million in its opening weekend, and it remained at number one for nine weeks. It grossed US$174,803,506 at the U.S. and Canadian box office, being the second-highest-grossing film that year for both the studio and at the United States box office. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 46 million tickets in North America. The film was the highest-grossing non-American film at the US box office. 

It opened in London and Dublin on 12 December 1986 and was the highest-grossing film to open at only one cinema in the West End of London where it grossed £163,990 in its first week at the Leicester Square Theatre, beating the house record. Similar to its performance in Australia, by its third week of release the film had broken its own record, increasing its gross at the Leicester Square Theatre to £173,053 for the week. Its three-week gross of £463,460 was the biggest ever for a cinema in the UK at the time. It opened nationwide in the UK on 9 January 1987 where it became number one nationally, where it stayed for eight weeks to become one of the highest-grossing films of all-time with a gross of £20 million. It was the highest-grossing film of all-time in Ireland, with a gross of $2.8 million. 

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 37 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Infectiously easygoing charm and a leading man in the role he was born to play help &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; make the most of its familiar fish-out-of-water premise&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote: &quot;All of the cliches are in the right places, most of the gags pay off and there are moments of real amusement as the Australian cowboy wanders around Manhattan as a naive sightseer. The problem is that there&#x27;s not one moment of chemistry between the two stars: Paul Hogan as &#x27;Crocodile&#x27; Dundee and Linda Kozlowski as the clever little rich girl. The movie feels curiously machine-made, as if they had all the right ingredients and simply forgot to add the animal magnetism&quot;. Nina Darnton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that Paul Hogan was &quot;delightful&quot; in the title role, that the screenplay was &quot;witty, with a fine sense of irony and the gift at poking fun at its own conceits&quot;, and that &quot;Linda Kozlowski plays the reporter, Sue, very well&quot;, virtues which &quot;go a long way toward compensating for the film&#x27;s illogical plot and set-up situations&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that director Peter Faiman &quot;has problems with the pacing and a script (by Hogan and longtime TV colleague Ken Shadie) that has its flat, dull spots. Hogan is comfortable enough playing the wry, irreverent, amiable Aussie that seems close to his own persona, and teams well with Kozlowski, who radiates lots of charm, style and spunk&quot;. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote: &quot;Handsomely directed by Peter Faiman, the film punches most of the right buttons at most of the right times and emerges as an effective crowd-pleaser&quot;. Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the film &quot;has a double &#x27;fish out of water&#x27; structure—first she&#x27;s the fish, then he&#x27;s the fish—but the movie doesn&#x27;t go anywhere with it, mostly because the characters are such nullities ... There&#x27;s no drama in &#x27;Crocodile Dundee&#x27; because there&#x27;s no real conflict between these characters&quot;. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is nothing you can examine deeply or mull over afterward. It&#x27;s simply an expert crowd-pleaser. It has such a sure, easy, confident touch that it&#x27;s almost failure-proof—like a tip of the hat, a sip of beer, a quick, golden &#x27;G&#x27;day&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;as dull and lumbering as its hero&quot;.

Although &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; was a hit both in Australia and abroad, it became controversial with some Australian critics and audiences who resented the image of Australians as being ocker. Robert Hughes complained in 2000 that to Americans &quot;&quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; is a work of social realism&quot;, giving them a Wild West&#x27; fantasy&quot; about Australia. David Droga said in 2018, however, that &quot;there has been no better ad for Australia than that movie&quot;.

The film became the first in the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; series, with two sequels and a Super Bowl commercial.

===Accolades===
==Sequels==

A sequel titled &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; was released in 1988.

<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, the Kuratowski closure axioms are a set of axioms that can be used to define a topological structure on a set. They are equivalent to the more commonly used open set definition. They were first formalized by Kazimierz Kuratowski, and the idea was further studied by mathematicians such as Wacław Sierpiński and António Monteiro, among others.

A similar set of axioms can be used to define a topological structure using only the dual notion of interior operator.

== Definition ==
===Kuratowski closure operators and weakenings===
Let formula_1 be an arbitrary set and formula_2 its power set. A Kuratowski closure operator is a unary operation formula_3 with the following properties:

A consequence of formula_4 preserving binary unions is the following condition:

In fact if we rewrite the equality in [K4] as an inclusion, giving the weaker axiom [K4&quot;] (&quot;subadditivity&quot;):

then it is easy to see that axioms [K4&#x27;] and [K4&quot;] together are equivalent to [K4] (see the next-to-last paragraph of Proof 2 below).

 includes a fifth (optional) axiom requiring that singleton sets should be stable under closure: for all formula_5, formula_6. He refers to topological spaces which satisfy all five axioms as &quot;T1-spaces&quot; in contrast to the more general spaces which only satisfy the four listed axioms. Indeed, these spaces correspond exactly to the topological T1-spaces via the usual correspondence (see below).

If requirement [K3] is omitted, then the axioms define a Čech closure operator. If [K1] is omitted instead, then an operator satisfying [K2], [K3] and [K4&#x27;] is said to be a Moore closure operator. A pair formula_7 is called Kuratowski, Čech or Moore closure space depending on the axioms satisfied by formula_4.

=== Alternative axiomatizations ===
The four Kuratowski closure axioms can be replaced by a single condition, given by Pervin:
Axioms [K1]–[K4] can be derived as a consequence of this requirement:

# Choose formula_9. Then formula_10, or formula_11. This immediately implies [K1].
# Choose an arbitrary formula_12 and formula_13. Then, applying axiom [K1], formula_14, implying [K2].
# Choose formula_15 and an arbitrary formula_16. Then, applying axiom [K1], formula_17, which is [K3].
# Choose arbitrary formula_18. Applying axioms [K1]–[K3], one derives [K4].

Alternatively, had proposed a weaker axiom that only entails [K2]–[K4]:

Requirement [K1] is independent of [M] : indeed, if formula_19, the operator formula_20 defined by the constant assignment formula_21 satisfies [M] but does not preserve the empty set, since formula_22. Notice that, by definition, any operator satisfying [M] is a Moore closure operator.

A more symmetric alternative to [M] was also proven by M. O. Botelho and M. H. Teixeira to imply axioms [K2]–[K4]:
== Analogous structures ==
=== Interior, exterior and boundary operators ===
A dual notion to Kuratowski closure operators is that of Kuratowski interior operator, which is a map formula_23 satisfying the following similar requirements:

For these operators, one can reach conclusions that are completely analogous to what was inferred for Kuratowski closures. For example, all Kuratowski interior operators are &quot;isotonic&quot;, i.e. they satisfy [K4&#x27;], and because of intensivity [I2], it is possible to weaken the equality in [I3] to a simple inclusion.

The duality between Kuratowski closures and interiors is provided by the natural complement operator on formula_2, the map formula_25 sending formula_26. This map is an orthocomplementation on the power set lattice, meaning it satisfies De Morgan&#x27;s laws: if formula_27 is an arbitrary set of indices and formula_28,
formula_29

By employing these laws, together with the defining properties of formula_30, one can show that any Kuratowski interior induces a Kuratowski closure (and vice versa), via the defining relation formula_31 (and formula_32). Every result obtained concerning formula_4 may be converted into a result concerning formula_34 by employing these relations in conjunction with the properties of the orthocomplementation formula_30.

 further provides analogous axioms for Kuratowski exterior operators and Kuratowski boundary operators, which also induce Kuratowski closures via the relations formula_36 and formula_37.

=== Abstract operators ===

Notice that axioms [K1]–[K4] may be adapted to define an &quot;abstract&quot; unary operation formula_38 on a general bounded lattice formula_39, by formally substituting set-theoretic inclusion with the partial order associated to the lattice, set-theoretic union with the join operation, and set-theoretic intersections with the meet operation; similarly for axioms [I1]–[I4]. If the lattice is orthocomplemented, these two abstract operations induce one another in the usual way. Abstract closure or interior operators can be used to define a generalized topology on the lattice.

Since neither unions nor the empty set appear in the requirement for a Moore closure operator, the definition may be adapted to define an abstract unary operator formula_40 on an arbitrary poset formula_41.

== Connection to other axiomatizations of topology ==

=== Induction of topology from closure ===
A closure operator naturally induces a topology as follows. Let formula_1 be an arbitrary set. We shall say that a subset formula_43 is closed with respect to a Kuratowski closure operator formula_44 if and only if it is a &quot;fixed point&quot; of said operator, or in other words it is &quot;stable under&quot; formula_4, i.e. formula_46. The claim is that the family of all subsets of the total space that are complements of closed sets satisfies the three usual requirements for a topology, or equivalently, the family formula_47 of all closed sets satisfies the following:
Notice that, by idempotency [K3], one may succinctly write formula_48.
[T1] By extensivity [K2], formula_49 and since closure maps the power set of formula_1 into itself (that is, the image of any subset is a subset of formula_1), formula_52 we have formula_53. Thus formula_54. The preservation of the empty set [K1] readily implies formula_55.

[T2] Next, let formula_56 be an arbitrary set of indices and let formula_57 be closed for every formula_58. By extensivity [K2], formula_59. Also, by isotonicity [K4&#x27;], if formula_60for all indices formula_61, then formula_62 for all formula_61, which implies formula_64. Therefore, formula_65, meaning formula_66.

[T3] Finally, let formula_56 be a finite set of indices and let formula_57 be closed for every formula_69. From the preservation of binary unions [K4], and using induction on the number of subsets of which we take the union, we have formula_70. Thus, formula_71.
=== Induction of closure from topology ===

Conversely, given a family formula_72 satisfying axioms [T1]–[T3], it is possible to construct a Kuratowski closure operator in the following way: if formula_73 and formula_74 is the inclusion upset of formula_75, then
formula_76

defines a Kuratowski closure operator formula_77 on formula_2.
[K1] Since formula_79, formula_80 reduces to the intersection of all sets in the family formula_72; but formula_82 by axiom [T1], so the intersection collapses to the null set and [K1] follows.

[K2] By definition of formula_83, we have that formula_84 for all formula_85, and thus formula_75 must be contained in the intersection of all such sets. Hence follows extensivity [K2].

[K3] Notice that, for all formula_73, the family formula_88 contains formula_89 itself as a minimal element w.r.t. inclusion. Hence formula_90, which is idempotence [K3].

[K4&#x27;] Let formula_91: then formula_92, and thus formula_93. Since the latter family may contain more elements than the former, we find formula_94, which is isotonicity [K4&#x27;]. Notice that isotonicity implies formula_95 and formula_96, which together imply formula_97.

[K4] Finally, fix formula_98. Axiom [T2] implies formula_99; furthermore, axiom [T2] implies that formula_100. By extensivity [K2] one has formula_101 and formula_102, so that formula_103. But formula_104, so that all in all formula_105. Since then formula_106 is a minimal element of formula_107 w.r.t. inclusion, we find formula_108. Point 4. ensures additivity [K4].
=== Exact correspondence between the two structures ===
In fact, these two complementary constructions are inverse to one another: if formula_109 is the collection of all Kuratowski closure operators on formula_1, and formula_111 is the collection of all families consisting of complements of all sets in a topology, i.e. the collection of all families satisfying [T1]–[T3], then formula_112 such that formula_113 is a bijection, whose inverse is given by the assignment formula_114.
First we prove that formula_115, the identity operator on formula_109. For a given Kuratowski closure formula_117, define formula_118; then if formula_73 its primed closure formula_120 is the intersection of all formula_4-stable sets that contain formula_75. Its non-primed closure formula_123 satisfies this description: by extensivity [K2] we have formula_124, and by idempotence [K3] we have formula_125, and thus formula_126. Now, let formula_127 such that formula_128: by isotonicity [K4&#x27;] we have formula_129, and since formula_130 we conclude that formula_131. Hence formula_123 is the minimal element of formula_133 w.r.t. inclusion, implying formula_134.

Now we prove that formula_135. If formula_136 and formula_137 is the family of all sets that are stable under formula_77, the result follows if both formula_139 and formula_140. Let formula_141: hence formula_142. Since formula_89 is the intersection of an arbitrary subfamily of formula_72, and the latter is complete under arbitrary intersections by [T2], then formula_145. Conversely, if formula_146, then formula_89 is the minimal superset of formula_75 that is contained in formula_72. But that is trivially formula_75 itself, implying formula_141.
We observe that one may also extend the bijection formula_152 to the collection formula_153 of all Čech closure operators, which strictly contains formula_109; this extension formula_155 is also surjective, which signifies that all Čech closure operators on formula_1 also induce a topology on formula_1. However, this means that formula_155 is no longer a bijection.

== Examples ==
* As discussed above, given a topological space formula_1 we may define the closure of any subset formula_12 to be the set formula_161, i.e. the intersection of all closed sets of formula_1 which contain formula_75. The set formula_123 is the smallest closed set of formula_1 containing formula_75, and the operator formula_3 is a Kuratowski closure operator.
* If formula_1 is any set, the operators formula_169 such that formula_170are Kuratowski closures. The first induces the indiscrete topology formula_171, while the second induces the discrete topology formula_2.

*Fix an arbitrary formula_173, and let formula_174 be such that formula_175 for all formula_73. Then formula_177 defines a Kuratowski closure; the corresponding family of closed sets formula_178 coincides with formula_179, the family of all subsets that contain formula_41. When formula_181, we once again retrieve the discrete topology formula_2 (i.e. formula_183, as can be seen from the definitions).
* If formula_184 is an infinite cardinal number such that formula_185, then the operator formula_186 such thatformula_187satisfies all four Kuratowski axioms. If formula_188, this operator induces the cofinite topology on formula_1; if formula_190, it induces the cocountable topology.

== Properties ==

* Since any Kuratowski closure is isotonic, and so is obviously any inclusion mapping, one has the (isotonic) Galois connection formula_191, provided one views formula_2as a poset with respect to inclusion, and formula_193 as a subposet of formula_2. Indeed, it can be easily verified that, for all formula_73 and formula_196, formula_197 if and only if formula_198.
* If formula_199 is a subfamily of formula_2, then formula_201
* If formula_98, then formula_203.

== Topological concepts in terms of closure ==

=== Refinements and subspaces ===
A pair of Kuratowski closures formula_204 such that formula_205 for all formula_73 induce topologies formula_207 such that formula_208, and vice versa. In other words, formula_209 dominates formula_210 if and only if the topology induced by the latter is a refinement of the topology induced by the former, or equivalently formula_211. For example, formula_212 clearly dominates formula_213(the latter just being the identity on formula_2). Since the same conclusion can be reached substituting formula_215 with the family formula_216 containing the complements of all its members, if formula_109 is endowed with the partial order formula_218 for all formula_73 and formula_111 is endowed with the refinement order, then we may conclude that formula_152 is an antitonic mapping between posets.

In any induced topology (relative to the subset &quot;A&quot;) the closed sets induce a new closure operator that is just the original closure operator restricted to &quot;A&quot;: formula_222, for all formula_223.

=== Continuous maps, closed maps and homeomorphisms ===
A function formula_224 is continuous at a point formula_225 iff formula_226, and it is continuous everywhere iff formula_227 for all subsets formula_73. The mapping formula_229 is a closed map iff the reverse inclusion holds, and it is a homeomorphism iff it is both continuous and closed, i.e. iff equality holds.

=== Separation axioms ===
Let formula_7 be a Kuratowski closure space. Then

* formula_1 is a T0-space iff formula_232 implies formula_233;
* formula_1 is a T1-space iff formula_235 for all formula_5;
* formula_1 is a T2-space iff formula_232 implies that there exists a set formula_73 such that both formula_240 and formula_241, where formula_30 is the set complement operator.

=== Closeness and separation ===
A point formula_225 is close to a subset formula_75 if formula_245This can be used to define a proximity relation on the points and subsets of a set.

Two sets formula_98 are separated iff formula_247. The space formula_1 is connected iff it cannot be written as the union of two separated subsets.

<doc id="331600" wikidata="Q27434" url="?curid=331600" title="Common scoter">
<text>The common scoter (Melanitta nigra) is a large sea duck, in length, which breeds over the far north of Europe and the Palearctic east to the Olenyok River. The black scoter (&quot;M. americana&quot;) of North America and eastern Siberia was formerly considered to be a subspecies.

==Taxonomy==
The common scoter was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas nigra&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Lapland, England. The common scoter is now one of six species placed in the genus &quot;Melanitta&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot;. The common scoter was formerly considered to be conspecific with the black scoter (&quot;Melanitta americana&quot;) but the two taxa are now treated as separate species. The common scoter is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The common scoter is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. The male is all black with a bulbous bill which shows some yellow coloration around the nostrils. The female is a brown bird with pale cheeks, very similar to female black scoter. This species can be distinguished from other scoters, apart from black scoter, by the lack of white anywhere on the drake and the more extensive pale areas on the female. The black scoter and common scoter have diagnosably distinct vocalisations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
It winters farther south in temperate zones, on the coasts of Europe as far south as Morocco. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off and dive together.

The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. 6–8 eggs are laid.

This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs; it also eats aquatic insects and small fish when on fresh water.

The common scoter is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==UK population and current issues==
In 1977, the ornithologist Bruce Campbell estimated the wintering population in north-western Europe to be about 130,000, mostly in the Baltic area, and the UK population at about 20,000. There is a marked passage in spring through the Straits of Dover.

In 2003, a previously unknown wintering population of 50,000+ was found on Shell Flat in the north west of England by Cirrus Energy whilst surveying the area for a new wind farm. Due to this development and an oil spill off the coast of Wales in 1996, questions about the common scoter population have been asked in the UK Parliament.

Although the common scoter is a winter visitor to the UK, there are some breeding pairs in the north of Scotland. The species has been placed on the RSPB conservation Red List because of a greater than 50% decline in the UK breeding population. In 1998, the UK Government agreed to a biodiversity action plan (BAP) for the common scoter to increase the breeding population to 100 pairs by 2008. The Northern Irish population, which had reached a peak of 150–200 pairs in the 1970s, crashed disastrously in the 1990s and by 2010 there were no confirmed reports of breeding. However, 100 pairs were recorded in the south of Ireland in a 1995 survey. UK breeding pairs have declined to 35 as of 2015 and attempts are being made to research why.

At the third steering group meeting of the UK Common Scoter Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), the population in the Shell Flat area was put at 16,500 wintering scoter and 5,000 moulting birds, of which 4,000 used the footprint area of the proposed wind farm.

==Scoters and meatless Fridays in France==
In parts of France, in the nineteenth century and earlier, the common scoter was accepted by the Roman Catholic Church as a substitute for fish during the Friday fast.

<text>Discovery Records was a United States–based record company and label known for its recordings of jazz music.

Discovery was founded in 1948 by jazz fan and promoter Albert Marx; it was headquartered in Hollywood, California. The record label would eventually record jazz notables such as Dizzy Gillespie, Georgie Auld, Red Norvo, Art Pepper, Joe Pass and Charles Mingus. Discovery later recorded such performers as singers Lorez Alexandria and Ernie Andrews, and Grammy winning composer-band leader Gerald Wilson.

Marx had first become artistic for later Musicraft Records in 1944 before starting his own label. In the 1970s, Musicraft Records was revived through Discovery/Trend by Albert Marx in Los Angeles. He also started the Trend AM-PM label in the 1980s to document and promote talented educational, college level jazz ensembles to include the Los Angeles Jazz Workshop, Nashville Jazz Machine and the Fullerton College Jazz Ensemble. His estate sold the Discovery, Trend and Musicraft jazz labels in 1991 to Jac Holzman, which he refashioned into a contemporary label. In 1993, Discovery Records was acquired by Warner Music Group and was absorbed by Sire Records in 1996.

<doc id="331617" wikidata="Q529048" url="?curid=331617" title="Black scoter">
<text>The black scoter or American scoter (Melanitta americana) is a large sea duck, in length. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;netta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;. The species name is from the Latin for &quot;American&quot;.

Together with the common scoter &quot;M. nigra&quot;, it forms the subgenus &quot;Oidemia&quot;; the two are sometimes considered conspecific, the black scoter then being referred to as &quot;M. nigra americana&quot;. Its French name, used in parts of its Canadian range, is macreuse noire (also meaning &quot;black scoter&quot;). The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

==Description==
This large sea duck is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. The adult male is all black with a very bulbous bill which is mostly yellow. The female is a brown bird with pale cheeks, very similar to female common scoter. The adult female averages about and in length, while the adult male is on average and in length.

This species can be distinguished from other scoters, apart from common scoter, by the lack of white anywhere on the drake, and the more extensive pale areas on the female.

===Vocalisations===
The black scoter and common scoter have diagnosably distinct vocalisations.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black scoter breeds in the far north of North America in Labrador and Newfoundland to the southeast and northwest of Hudson Bay. It also occurs on the Siberian side of the Bering Straits east of the Yana River. It winters farther south in temperate zones, on the coasts of the northern USA and Canada, on the Pacific coast south to the San Francisco Bay region and on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and in Asia as far south as China.

Some birds may over-winter on the Great Lakes. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe; only drakes are safely identifiable out of range, so females are likely to be undetected.

==Ecology==

This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs while migrating or wintering on the sea-coasts, and feeds on insects and their larvae, especially caddisflies, fish eggs and, more rarely, vegetation such as duck weed while nesting on freshwater. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters in winter quarters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together; in the breeding season they are less social. It has been suggested that in coastal waters this species prefers sheltered embayments, and possibly waters that include some mixed depths.

Black scoters nest later than most other ducks in North America. Pairs form in late winter or spring. The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. 5–7 eggs are laid. Each eggs weighs from , or 8% of the females body weight. The incubation period may range from 27 to 31 days. Females brood their young extensively for about 3 weeks, after which the still flightless young must fend for themselves.

The male performs a diagnostic downward head movement when stretching his wings.

<doc id="331620" wikidata="Q230739" url="?curid=331620" title="Katie Couric">
<text>Katherine Anne Couric ( ; born January 7, 1957) is an American journalist and presenter. She is founder of Katie Couric Media, a multimedia news and production company. She also publishes a daily newsletter, &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;. From 2013 to 2017, she was Yahoo&#x27;s Global News Anchor. Couric has been a television host at all of the Big Three television networks in the United States, and in her early career she was an assignment editor for CNN. She worked for NBC News from 1989 to 2006, CBS News from 2006 to 2011, and ABC News from 2011 to 2014. She was the first solo female anchor of a major network (CBS) evening news program. In 2021, she appeared as a guest host for the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, the first woman to host the flagship American version of the show in its history.

In addition to her roles in television news, Couric hosted &quot;Katie&quot;, a syndicated daytime talk show produced by Disney–ABC Domestic Television from September 2012 to June 2014. Some of her most important presenting roles include co-host of &quot;Today&quot;, anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and as a correspondent for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Couric&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;The Best Advice I Ever Got: Lessons from Extraordinary Lives&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In 2004, Couric was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
Katherine Anne Couric was born in Arlington, Virginia, the daughter of Elinor Tullie (née Hene), a homemaker and part-time writer, and John Martin Couric Jr., a public relations executive and news editor at &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; and the United Press in Washington, D.C. Her mother was Jewish, and converted to Presbyterianism before the marriage. Couric&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Bert Hene and Clara L. Frohsin, were the children of Jewish emigrants from Germany. Couric&#x27;s father had French, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. She was raised Presbyterian. In a report for &quot;Today&quot;, she traced her patrilineal ancestry back to a French orphan who immigrated to the U.S. in the 19th century, and became a broker in the cotton business.

Couric attended Arlington Public Schools: Jamestown Elementary, Williamsburg Middle School, and Yorktown High School, and was a cheerleader. As a high school student, she was an intern at Washington, D.C. all-news radio station WAVA. She enrolled at her father&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Virginia, in 1975, and was a Delta Delta Delta sorority sister. Couric served in several positions at UVA&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot;. During her fourth year at UVA, Couric was chosen to live as Senior Resident of The Lawn, the heart of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Academical Village. She graduated in 1979, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American Studies.

==Television career==

===Career beginnings===
Couric&#x27;s first job in 1979 was at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C., later joining CNN as an assignment editor. Between 1984 and 1986, she worked as a general-assignment reporter for the then-CBS affiliate WTVJ in Miami, Florida.
During the following two years, she reported for WRC-TV, the NBC owned- and -operated station in Washington, D.C., work which earned her an Associated Press award and an Emmy.

===NBC===

Couric joined &quot;NBC News&quot; in 1989 as Deputy Pentagon Correspondent. From 1989 to 1991, Couric was an anchor substitute. She filled in for Bryant Gumbel as host of &quot;Today&quot;; Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville as co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot;; Boyd Matson, Garrick Utley, Mary Alice Williams, and Maria Shriver as co-host of Sunday &quot;Today&quot;; Chris Wallace, Garrick Utley and Tim Russert as anchor of Meet The Press, Scott Simon, Mike Schneider (news anchor) , Jack Ford, Jackie Nespral, Giselle Fernandez and Jodi Applegate as co-host of &quot;Weekend Today&quot;; Connie Chung, Bob Jamieson, John Palmer, Norville, Faith Daniels, Margaret Larson, Ann Curry, and Linda Vester as anchor of the former NBC News program &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;. She also subbed for Daniels, Norville, and John Palmer as the news anchor on &quot;Today&quot;.

Couric returned to NBC to co-host the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremonies with Mike Tirico, and to provide additional Winter Olympic coverage and athlete interviews. During the opening ceremony she suggested, erroneously, that the Dutch use their skates as a normal mode of transportation during wintertime, prompting criticism and bemusement from the U.S. Embassy in the Netherlands and others. Couric apologized that her intended compliment did not &quot;come out&quot; as intended, which the Embassy accepted, and invited her to the Netherlands for a tour.

====&quot;Today&quot; (1991–2006)====
In 1989, Couric joined &quot;Today&quot; as national political correspondent, becoming a substitute co-host in February 1991, when Norville went on maternity leave. Norville did not return and Couric became permanent co-anchor on April 5, 1991. In 1994, she became co-anchor of &quot;Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric&quot;—an evening time weekly TV newsmagazine with Tom Brokaw—which was later terminated and folded into part of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, where her reports appeared regularly and she was named the anchor. She remained at &quot;Today&quot; and NBC News for fifteen years until May 31, 2006, when she announced that she would be going to CBS to anchor the CBS Evening News, becoming the first solo female anchor of the &quot;Big Three&quot; weekday nightly news broadcasts.

While at NBC, Couric occasionally filled in for Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. From 1989 to 1993, Couric also filled in for Connie Chung, Maria Shriver and for Garrick Utley and later Brian Williams and John Seigenthaler on the Weekend Edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. In addition, during her time on &quot;Today&quot;, she served as a host of the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade for 14 years from 1991 to 2005. On June 17, 1997, Couric asked the &quot;Washington Post&quot;’s Bob Woodward about the Clinton &quot;Chinagate&quot; scandal: &quot;Are members of the media, do you think, Bob, too scandal-obsessed, looking for something at every corner?&quot;

Couric hosted or worked on a number of news specials, like &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Business: America&#x27;s Children&quot; in 1995. Similar entertainment specials were &quot;Legend to Legend Night: A Celebrity Cavalcade&quot; in 1993, and &quot;Harry Potter: Behind the Magic&quot; in 2001. Couric has also co-hosted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. She has broadcast with Bob Costas, beginning with the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Couric has interviewed many international political figures and celebrities, including presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and First Lady Barbara Bush. John F. Kennedy Jr. gave Couric his first and last interviews.

Couric has won multiple television reporting awards throughout her career, including the Peabody Award for her series &quot;Confronting Colon Cancer&quot;. Couric has also interviewed former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (her first television interview), Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, and Laura Bush.

On May 28, 2008, Couric made a return visit to &quot;Today&quot;, since leaving almost two years to the very day back on May 31, 2006. She made this appearance alongside her evening counterparts, NBC Nightly News&#x27; Brian Williams &amp; ABC World News&#x27; Charles Gibson, to promote an organization called &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; and raise cancer awareness on all three major television networks; ABC, CBS &amp; NBC. Couric, Gibson and Williams made appearances together on all three major network morning shows, first on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Early Show&quot;, then on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and finally on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

Couric returned for a week-long stint as co-host of Today in January 2017 to mark Matt Lauer&#x27;s 20th anniversary as anchor of the program.

===Move to CBS News===

====&quot;CBS Evening News&quot; (2006–2011)====

Couric announced on April 5, 2006, that she would be leaving &quot;Today&quot;. CBS confirmed later the same day that Couric would become the new anchor and managing editor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Couric would also contribute to &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and anchor prime-time news specials for CBS. Couric earned US$15 million per year while at CBS, a salary that made her the highest paid journalist in the world, a salary similar to Barbara Walters&#x27; at ABC. She made her first broadcast as anchor and managing editor of the &quot;CBS Evening News with Katie Couric&quot; on September 5, 2006.

CBS heavily promoted Couric&#x27;s arrival at the network, hoping to revive the evening news format, but there were suggestions that it backfired. Although there was much interest during her first week as anchor, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; remained a distant third in viewership, behind &quot;ABC World News&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. While Couric&#x27;s ratings improved over her predecessor, Bob Schieffer, ABC&#x27;s Charles Gibson widened World News&#x27; lead over Evening News.

Couric also announced CBS News&#x27;s official projection for the 2008 United States Presidential Election.

The &quot;CBS Evening News with Katie Couric&quot; won the 2008 and 2009 Edward R. Murrow Award for best newscast. In 2009, Couric was awarded the Emmy Governor&#x27;s Award for her broadcasting career.

She has interviewed presidents, cabinet members, celebrities, and business executives around the world, including President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Former President George W. Bush, Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, John Edwards just after the announcement that his then-wife Elizabeth&#x27;s cancer had returned, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, Norah Jones and Michael J. Fox.

Couric led CBS News&#x27; coverage of the 2006 midterm elections, the 2008 Presidential election and conventions, and 2010 midterm elections. Couric was the first network anchor on the ground in Port au Prince after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. After the BP oil spill, Couric anchored from the Gulf Coast weekly and brought much attention to the disaster. She reported from Cairo&#x27;s Tahrir Square during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011. In April 2011, she led CBS News&#x27; coverage from London for the Wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton.

Couric was the only solo female evening news anchor in the United States, until December 21, 2009, when Diane Sawyer succeeded the retiring Charles Gibson for &quot;ABC World News&quot;. Couric and Sawyer were previous rivals as the hosts of &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, respectively.

In early 2011, Couric announced that she would be leaving her anchor post at &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; when her contract expired. Couric made her final broadcast in the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; chair on Thursday, May 19, 2011.

====&quot;60 Minutes&quot; (2006–2011)====
Couric was a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent and contributed eight to ten stories a year for the program. She was the first to interview pilot Chesley Sullenberger after the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot; airplane landing. She also interviewed Valerie Plame, Robert Gates and Michelle Rhee for the program.

====Palin interviews (2008)====
The Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric were a series of interviews Couric taped with 2008 U.S. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin. The interviews were repeatedly broadcast on television before the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Couric received the Walter Cronkite Award for Journalism Excellence for the interviews. Steve Schmidt, McCain&#x27;s senior campaign strategist and advisor, later reflected on the interview, saying &quot;I think it was the most consequential interview from a negative perspective that a candidate for national office has gone through...&quot;

====&quot;CBS Reports&quot; (2009–2011)====

Couric was the lead reporter for two &quot;CBS Reports&quot; series, which aired across all CBS News platforms. The first series, &quot;CBS Reports: Children of the Recession&quot;, highlighted the pain suffered by the youngest of the then ongoing Great Recession&#x27;s victims. The series won the Columbia School of Journalism&#x27;s Alfred DuPont Award for Excellence in Journalism. The second series, which aired in early 2010, was &quot;CBS Reports: Where America Stands&quot;, which featured veteran CBS News correspondents reporting on major issues facing the United States in the decade ahead with research by the CBS News Polling Unit.

====&quot;@katiecouric&quot; (2009–2011)====
Couric hosted a weekly, one-hour interview program on CBSNews.com. Her first guest was Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck. Subsequent interviews included former U.S. vice president Al Gore, actor Hugh Jackman, recording artist Shakira, First Lady Michelle Obama, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Thomas Friedman, singer Justin Bieber, actress Jane Lynch, talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, actor Daniel Radcliffe, Bill Gates, former White House Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, national Tea Party movement leader Michael Johns, football player Drew Brees, and author Malcolm Gladwell.

===Return to ABC News===

====ABC News (2011–2013)====
From 2011 to 2013, Couric was a special correspondent for ABC News, a role she has incorporated into her talk show. Her first appearance on the network was a Sarah Jessica Parker interview on &quot;Nightline&quot;. Couric co-anchored coverage of the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, alongside Diane Sawyer, Christiane Amanpour, Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Vargas, George Stephanopoulos, and Robin Roberts. Couric was hosting &quot;Today&quot; on &quot;NBC&quot; at the time of the attacks, and led CBS News&#x27;s coverage of the fifth anniversary. Couric also guest co-hosted &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot;. Couric interviewed Lady Gaga in primetime on Thanksgiving as part of &quot;A Very Gaga Thanksgiving&quot;. In November 2011, Couric hosted a special primetime ABC news program highlighting Regis Philbin&#x27;s retirement, after Philbin&#x27;s 25-year tenure at ABC.

Similar to colleague Barbara Walters, Couric anchors specials for the network and for the newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot;. While she contributes to the news program all throughout the year, in 2011, Couric created her newly annual special &quot;The Year with Katie Couric&quot;, which is a program that marks the end of the year and covers some of the biggest newsmakers and news events of that year. This is a collaboration with &quot;People&quot; magazine, which also reflects events in the world of news, sports, politics, and major headlines that helped shape the world. This is very similar to that of Walters&#x27;s iconic &quot;Barbara Walters&#x27; 10 Most Fascinating People&quot;, a year end program that marks the end of the year and acknowledges the people that had the most impact on the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year. As part of the special, Couric interviews fellow members of the media that can provide some insight on some events that occurred.

From April 2 to 6, 2012, Couric substituted for co-anchor Robin Roberts on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, her first stint at hosting a morning news show since leaving &quot;Today&quot;.

====&quot;Katie&quot; (2012–2014)====
On June 6, 2011, ABC announced that Couric had signed a record US$40-million contract, and would begin hosting a daytime talk show for its Disney-ABC Domestic Television arm that would debut in September 2012; Couric would also contribute to ABC News programming. On August 22, 2011, it was announced that Couric&#x27;s talk show would be called &quot;Katie&quot;. &quot;Katie&quot; is the second web show that Couric has been affiliated with, the first being &quot;@katiecouric&quot; on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. The first episode aired on September 10, 2012.

Couric has incorporated her affiliation with the ABC News Division with her ABC Daytime show by having news colleagues Christiane Amanpour, Deborah Roberts, Mike Boettcher, Matt Gutman, Richard Besser, Marci Gonzalez, Jim Avila, Dan Abrams, Josh Elliott, Brian Ross, ABC News weather anchors Sam Champion and Ginger Zee, as well as &quot;ABC World News&quot; anchors Diane Sawyer and David Muir correspond on &quot;Katie&quot; for important news events. On the domestic end of her affiliation, Couric has had as guests &quot;The View&quot; co-host Whoopi Goldberg, Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan of &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot;, as well as some cast members of the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Disney-ABC Domestic Television renewed &quot;Katie&quot; for a second season starting in fall 2013. However, in October 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Katie&quot; was close to cancellation because of a low Q Score, low ratings, and a reported disdain of her core female audience. The syndicated show averaged a 1.7 household rating during its first season and a 1.8 in the 2013–14 season. In December 2013, Disney–ABC Domestic Television announced that &quot;Katie&quot; had been canceled. The last show was taped on June 12, 2014 and the series finale aired on July 30, 2014.

===Yahoo! / ABC News (2014–2017)===
In November 2013, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer announced she had hired Couric as Global Anchor of Yahoo! News. Couric debuted in the new role on January 13, 2014, in an interview with former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. She later interviewed United States Secretary of State John Kerry.
In March 2015, in an effort to collaborate and to consolidate their news pools, Yahoo News and ABC News has expanded their partnership to include specials and features, with Couric and other Yahoo editors to appear in daily segments on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The extended partnership secured Couric as having a spot in the ABC News division, as a special contributor.

In her book &quot;Going There&quot;, Couric admitted to editing a 2016 interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The edits included removing portions of Ginsburg&#x27;s statements that were critical of NFL protestors kneeling during the national anthem. Couric stated that her intent was to &quot;protect&quot; Ginsburg from her potentially unpopular comments as they were &quot;unworthy of a crusader for equality&quot;.

In June 2017, after Verizon purchased Yahoo! and combined it into Oath, Couric decided to end her contract at Yahoo! News, preferring to work with them on a &quot;project basis&quot; only, while she continues to expand her own production company.

===Public image===
Couric has been dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart,&quot; largely due to her co-anchor role for 15 years on &quot;The Today Show&quot;. On May 12, 2003, Couric guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; as part of a swap campaign, and had 45 percent more viewers than on other nights. She has been the only guest host used by Jay Leno on either &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; or his short-lived &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. Leno filled in for her on &quot;Today&quot; that same day. CNN and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; noted that instead of using Leno&#x27;s regular solid desk, &quot;workers cut away the front of her desk to expose her legs while she interviewed &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Simon Cowell and &quot;Austin Powers&quot; star Mike Myers&quot;.

===Other work===
In a media crossover to animated film, Couric was the voice of news-reporter &quot;Katie Current&quot; in the US version of the film &quot;Shark Tale&quot;. She has also made cameo appearances in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (as a Georgia State Prison guard) and an episode of &quot;General Hospital&quot; (as a journalist pretending to be a doctor: a storyline she helped create). She guest-starred as herself on the CBS sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; in 1992 and in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in late 2002, and made a cameo appearance on a &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; episode. On May 12, 2003, she traded places for a day with &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Jay Leno. Couric also co-hosted NBC&#x27;s live coverage of Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1991 until 2005. She received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2005. Couric delivered the graduation speech at her alma mater University of Virginia on May 20, 2012, at Randolph-Macon College on June 1, 2013, and at Princeton University on June 1, 2009. She also works with Carmen Marc Valvo to help publicize the deadliness, yet preventability, of colorectal cancer. On May 16, 2010, Couric received an honorary doctor of science degree for her efforts in raising awareness of colorectal cancer and for her commitment to advancing medical research from Case Western Reserve University, and later gave the university&#x27;s 2010 convocation keynote address. In 2016, she starred as herself in &quot;Sully&quot; to recreate the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview for the film.

In 2011, she gave the university commencement speech at Boston University and was awarded another doctoral degree, Doctor of Humane Letters. She has also hosted a Sesame Street special, &quot;When Families Grieve.&quot; The special, which aired on PBS on April 14, 2010, dealt with the issues that children go through when a parent dies. On February 6, 2011, Couric guest-starred on the post-Super Bowl episode of &quot;Glee&quot;, playing herself interviewing Sue Sylvester after the cheerleading team lost the championship. Sylvester sarcastically referred to Couric as &quot;Diane Sawyer&quot; during the segment.

Couric is the author of two children&#x27;s books and a non-fiction collection of essays. Her children&#x27;s books &quot;The Brand New Kid&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Blue Ribbon Day&quot; (2004) were illustrated by Marjorie Priceman and published by Doubleday. &quot;The Brand New Kid&quot; topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list for children&#x27;s picture books, and was adapted into a 2006 musical by Melanie Marnich and Michael Friedman. Couric&#x27;s third book, &quot;The Best Advice I Ever Got: Lessons from Extraordinary Lives&quot;, was published by Random House in 2011. The book is a collection of essays compiled over the past year by Couric; contributors include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Queen Rania of Jordan, and former &quot;Today Show&quot; colleague Matt Lauer. Couric said that a 2010 convocation keynote address she gave inspired her to write the book. To this end, all profits of the book will be donated to Scholarship America.

In December 2013, Couric ran a segment on the HPV vaccine which critics accused of being too sympathetic to the scientifically unsupported claims that this vaccine was dangerous. For example, Seth Mnookin accused her broadcast of employing false balance. In addition, Alexandra Sifferlin, of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, compared Couric to Jenny McCarthy, a well-known anti-vaccine celebrity. On December 10, 2013, a week after the original segment was aired, Couric posted an article on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; responding to this criticism, in which she stated:

Throughout the 2010s, Couric served as executive producer on several films. In 2014, Couric was an executive producer and narrator for the documentary &quot;Fed Up&quot;, examining the food industry and obesity in the United States. In 2016, Couric was an executive producer and narrator for the documentary &quot;Under the Gun&quot;, examining gun violence and gun control in the United States. The documentary was criticized for having an eight-second pause for &quot;dramatic effect&quot; inserted instead of the answer given to a question Couric posed to a gun-rights group in Virginia. Couric posted a response on the documentary&#x27;s website stating, &quot;I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL)&quot;, and she included a transcript of the response she received. Later that year, the VCDL filed a defamation lawsuit for $12 million against Couric and the film&#x27;s director, Stephanie Soechtig, for continuing to promote and distribute the film without correcting the pause. The lawsuit was dismissed after a Virginia judge determined that the film scene was neither false nor defamatory. In 2015 Couric founded Katie Couric Media, a film production company which has partnered with National Geographic to produce several documentaries. The first of these, &quot;Gender Revolution&quot;, premiered in 2017. She was also an executive producer of &quot;Flint&quot;, a 2017 Lifetime drama about the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. In 2018, Couric hosted a docudrama series titled &quot;America Inside Out with Katie Couric&quot;, which was telecast on the National Geographic Channel.

Couric is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She is also a member of
the Peabody Awards board of directors, which is presented by the University of Georgia&#x27;s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

In 2019, she served as executive producer on Netflix&#x27;s true crime miniseries &quot;Unbelievable&quot;.

Couric signed on to serve as a substitute host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in January 2021 following the death of Alex Trebek. Her episodes aired from March 8 to March 19.

==Personal life and charitable work==
===Family and relationships===
Couric married attorney John Paul &quot;Jay&quot; Monahan III in 1989. She gave birth to their first daughter, Elinor Tully &quot;Ellie&quot; Monahan, in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1991; their second daughter, Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; was born in New York City on January 5, 1996. Her husband died of colorectal cancer in 1998 at the age of 42. In September 2013, she became engaged to financier John Molner after a two-year relationship. Couric married Molner in a small, private ceremony at her home in The Hamptons on June 21, 2014. The two star in the online cooking series &quot;Full Plate with Katie &amp; John&quot;, appearing on the Sur La Table website.

Her sister Emily Couric, a Virginia Democratic state senator, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 54 on October 18, 2001. Couric gave a eulogy at the funeral. She pointed out that it irritated Emily when people asked her if she was Katie Couric&#x27;s sister. She told the mourners, &quot;I just want you to know I will always be proud to say &#x27;I am Emily Couric&#x27;s sister&#x27;.&quot; Couric has two other siblings, Clara Couric Batchelor and John M. Couric Jr.

During a January 15, 2021 appearance on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Couric revealed that she is distantly related to William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States.

===Cancer and advocacy===
On September 28, 2022, Couric revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer on June 21 of that year after a routine screening. She underwent surgery for the disease in July and began radiation treatment on September 7.

Couric had become a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness ever since her first husband had died from the disease. She underwent a colonoscopy on-air in March 2000, and, according to a study published in 2003 in &quot;Archives of Internal Medicine&quot;, may have inspired many others to get checked as well: &quot;Katie Couric&#x27;s televised colon cancer awareness campaign was temporarily associated with an increase in colonoscopy use in two different data sets. This illustrates the possibility that a well-known individual can draw attention and support to worthwhile causes.&quot; On October 7, 2005, as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Couric broadcast her own mammogram on the &quot;Today&quot; show, in the hopes of recreating the &quot;Couric Effect&quot; around the issue of breast cancer. She also was very active in the National Hockey League&#x27;s Hockey Fights Cancer campaign, appearing in some public service announcements and doing voice-overs for several others.

Couric was the honored guest at the 2004 Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation fall gala. As the Guest of Honor for the inaugural American Cancer Society Discovery Ball, Couric was recognized for her leadership in increasing cancer awareness and screening. In 2011, Couric became the Honorary National Chair of the National Parkinson Foundation&#x27;s Moving Day campaign, a grassroots campaign to spotlight Parkinson&#x27;s disease awareness on a national level. Couric&#x27;s father died in 2011 at age 90 from complications due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (28 August 1825 – 14 July 1895) was a German lawyer, jurist, journalist, and writer. He is today regarded as a pioneer of sexology and the modern gay rights movement. Ulrichs has been described as the &quot;first gay man in world history&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ulrichs was born in the East Frisian village of Westerfeld, incorporated today within Aurich, which at the time was in the Kingdom of Hanover. His father was an architect who died when Ulrichs was only ten years old. After that he was brought up in Burgdorf by his mother&#x27;s family of Lutheran pastors. Ulrichs recalled that as a youngster he felt different from other boys and was attracted by the bright colors of military uniforms and women&#x27;s clothing. In 1839, at the age of fourteen, he experienced his first sexual encounter with his riding instructor. He graduated in law and theology from Göttingen University in 1846. From 1846 to 1848, he studied history at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, writing a dissertation in Latin on the Peace of Westphalia.

From 1849 to 1854, Ulrichs worked as a lawyer for the civil service in the Kingdom of Hannover. Initially he worked as an official administrative lawyer in various locations but did not enjoy the work or thrive. He transferred to the court system in 1853 and joined the bench as an assistant judge in the district court of Hildesheim. He resigned on 30 November 1854 rather than face dismissal should a possible blackmail attempt be made and his sexuality become common knowledge.

== Campaigner for sexual reform ==
In 1862, Ulrichs took the momentous step of telling his family and friends that he was, in his own words, an &quot;Urning&quot;, and began writing under the pseudonym of &quot;Numa Numantius&quot;. His first five pamphlets, collected as &quot;Forschungen über das Rätsel der mannmännlichen Liebe&quot; (&quot;Studies on the Riddle of Male-Male Love&quot;), explained such love as natural and biological, summed up with the Latin phrase &quot;anima muliebris virili corpore inclusa&quot; (a female psyche confined in a male body). In these essays, Ulrichs coined various terms to describe different sexual orientations, including &quot;Urning&quot; for a man who desires men (English &quot;Uranian&quot;), and &quot;Dioning&quot; for one who desires women. These terms are in reference to a section of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; in which two kinds of love are discussed, symbolised by an Aphrodite who is born from a male (Uranos), and an Aphrodite who is born from a female (Dione). Ulrichs also coined words for the female counterparts (&quot;Urningin&quot; and &quot;Dioningin&quot;), and for bisexuals and intersex persons.
In the 1860s, Ulrichs moved around Germany, always writing and publishing, and always in trouble with the law — though always for his words rather than for sexual offences. In 1864, his books were confiscated and banned by police in Saxony. Later the same thing happened in Berlin, and his works were banned throughout Prussia. Several of Ulrichs&#x27;s more important works are back in print, both in German and in translation.

Ulrichs was a patriotic Hanoverian, and when Prussia annexed Hanover in 1866 he was briefly imprisoned for opposing Prussian rule and all his papers were confiscated. Some of these papers were later found in the Prussian state archives and published in 2004. On release, he was forced into exile and left Hanover for good and moved to Würzburg in Bavaria. From there, he attended the Association of German Jurists in Munich where he wished to speak on the need to reform German laws against homosexuality. His motion was banned by the presiding committee, so he took the opportunity on the final day of the conference to protest his exclusion. On 29 August 1867, Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality and though he was shouted down it appears that some in the audience were stirred into support for his call. Ulrichs published his account of the events in Munich as &quot;Gladius Furens&quot;, which he published under his own name and distributed to all the lawyers who had attended the event. In that pamphlet he wrote:Until my dying day I will look back with pride that I found the courage to come face to face in battle against the spectre which for time immemorial has been injecting poison into me and into men of my nature. Many have been driven to suicide because all their happiness in life was tainted. Indeed, I am proud that I found the courage to deal the initial blow to the hydra of public contempt.Thereafter, he began publishing his urning pamphlets under his own name as an &#x27;urning&#x27; apologist for the cause. This makes Ulrichs quite distinct from any other writer on the subject at that time and for some time after. In 1868, the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word &quot;homosexual&quot; in a letter to Ulrichs, and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation (in modern words) began to be widely discussed.

Later he moved to Stuttgart, where he cultivated silkworms for an income but convened a weekly discussion at a restaurant on Gymnasiumstrasse with other urning activists. 

In 1879, Ulrichs published the twelfth and final pamphlet in his series on man-manly love, &quot;Critische Pfeile&quot;. Believing he had done all he could in Germany, he went into self-imposed exile in Italy shortly afterwards. For several years he travelled around the country before settling in L&#x27;Aquila.

He continued to write prolifically and publish his works (in German and Latin) at his own expense, notably a latin newspaper &quot;Alaudae&quot;, which had a wide readership. In 1895, he received an honorary diploma from the University of Naples. Shortly afterwards he died in L&#x27;Aquila. His gravestone is marked (in Latin), &quot;Exile and Pauper.&quot; His friend and benefactor Marquis Niccolò Persichetti, gave the eulogy at his funeral. At the end of his eulogy, he said:

== Legacy ==
Ulrichs distributed his pamphlets widely in a pamphleteering strategy to lawyers and the medical authorities of his day. Karl Westphal, quoted Ulrichs&#x27; writings in the first psychiatric paper on &#x27;contrary sexual feeling&#x27; and largely used Ulrichs&#x27; theoretical framework. Ulrichs also corresponded for many years with the psychiatrist, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who later acknowledged in a letter to Ulrichs that:From that day when you sent your writings – I believe it was in 1866 – I have turned my full attention to this phenomenon, which was just as puzzling as it was interesting to me; and it was only the knowledge of your books which motivated me to study this highly important area.Krafft-Ebing went on to publish &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis,&quot; arguably the foundational text in sexology. Ulrichs&#x27; huge influence on the emerging fields of the sexual sciences was not his only legacy though. When he first started publishing his pamphlets, he received hundreds of letters from same sex attracted men, who began calling themselves &#x27;urnings&#x27;. So arguably Ulrichs&#x27; greatest legacy was the dissemination of a sexual identity.

Forgotten for many years, Ulrichs later became something of a cult figure in Europe in the late 1980s. There are streets named for him in Munich, Bremen, Hanover, and Berlin. His birthday is marked each year by a lively street party and poetry reading at Karl-Heinrich-Ulrichs-Platz in Munich. The city of L&#x27;Aquila has restored his grave and hosts the annual pilgrimage to the cemetery. Later gay rights advocates were aware of their debt to Ulrichs. Magnus Hirschfeld thoroughly referenced Ulrichs in his &quot;The Homosexuality of Men and Women&quot; (1914). Volkmar Sigusch called Ulrichs the &quot;first gay man in world history.&quot;

In Ulrichs&#x27; memory, the International Lesbian and Gay Law Association presents a Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award for distinguished contributions to the advancement of sexual equality.

In an interview, Robert Beachy said &quot;I think it is reasonable to describe [Ulrichs] as the first gay person to publicly out himself.&quot;

== Latin writer ==
During his stay in Italy, he devoted himself, between 1889 and 1895, to the international use of Latin with the publishing of the Latin newspaper &quot;Alaudae&quot;, which was widely disseminated and made known many European Latin poets of his time. This review found a suite, in &quot;Vox Urbis: de litteris et bonis artibus commentarius&quot; published twice monthly by the architect and engineer Aristide Leonori between 1898 and 1913.

<doc id="331632" wikidata="Q4630787" url="?curid=331632" title="20th Maine Infantry Regiment">
<text>The 20th Maine Infantry Regiment was a volunteer regiment of the United States Army (Union Army) during the American Civil War (1861–1865), most famous for its defense of Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1–3, 1863. The 133rd Engineer Battalion of the Maine Army National Guard and the United States Army today carries on the lineage and traditions of the 20th Maine.

==Organization==
The 20th Maine was organized in the state of Maine and mustered into federal service on August 29, 1862, with Col. Adelbert Ames as its commander. It was assigned to the Army of the Potomac in the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps, where it would remain until mustered out on July 16, 1865. At that time, the brigade also consisted of the 16th Michigan, the 12th, 17th, and 44th New York, 83rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry regiments, and a Michigan company of sharpshooters.

==Combat history==
Prior to their notable actions at Gettysburg in July 1863, the regiment was held in reserve at Antietam in September 1862. The regiment was also among those forced to remain overnight within sight of the Confederate lines at Fredericksburg in December 1862, forcing the regiment&#x27;s Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain to shield himself with a dead man. The unit was unable to participate in the Battle of Chancellorsville in April–May 1863, due to a quarantine prompted by a tainted smallpox vaccine that had been issued to the unit&#x27;s soldiers. On May 20, 1863, Colonel Ames was promoted and was succeeded as colonel and commander of the regiment by Lt. Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain, who had been offered and declined leadership of the unit at the time it was formed.

===Gettysburg and Little Round Top===
The most notable battle was the regiment&#x27;s decisive role on July 2, 1863, in the Battle of Gettysburg at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where it was stationed on Little Round Top hill at the extreme left of the Union line. When the regiment came under heavy attack from the Confederate 15th and 47th Alabama regiments (part of the division led by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood), the 20th Maine ran low on ammunition after one and a half hours of continuous fighting; it responded to the sight of rebel infantry forming again for yet another push up the slope at them by instead suddenly charging downhill with fixed bayonets, surprising and scattering the Confederates, thus ending the attack on the hill and the attempt to flank the hill position and move around the south end of the Federal &quot;fishhook&quot;. The 20th Maine and the adjacent 83rd Pennsylvania together captured many men from both Alabama regiments (including Lt. Col. Michael Bulger, commander of the 47th), as well as several other men of the 4th Alabama and 4th and 5th Texas regiments of the same division. Had the 20th Maine retreated from the hill, the entire Union line would have been flanked, endangering and hurting other Union regiments in the vicinity.

===Later war===
Later actions in which the regiment participated included Second Rappahannock Station, Mine Run, The Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, the Siege of Petersburg, Peebles&#x27;s Farm, Lewis&#x27;s Farm/Quaker Road, White Oak Road, Five Forks, and Appomattox Court House.

===Disbandment===
The 20th Maine marched from Appomattox, Virginia, on May 2, reaching the national capital at Washington, D.C., on May 12, where the remaining original members were mustered out of service on June 4, 1865, with the remainder of the regiment leaving the federal service on July 16. The heritage of the 20th Maine is carried on today by the 133rd Engineer Battalion, Maine Army National Guard.

==Casualties==
* 1,621 enrollment (soldiers assigned to the regiment)
* 147 killed or died of wounds
* 381 wounded
* 146 died of disease
* 15 in Confederate prisons

==Cultural references==
The participation of the 20th Maine in the Battle of Fredericksburg is depicted in the 2003 feature film &quot;Gods And Generals&quot; (prequel movie to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Gettysburg&quot; based on Michael Shaara&#x27;s son Jeff Shaara&#x27;s historical novel of the same name).

The regiment&#x27;s downhill charge during the Battle of Gettysburg is depicted in the 1974 historical novels &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara (winner of the 1975 Pulitzer Prize in fiction) and &quot;Courage on Little Round Top&quot;, and was subsequently an important scene in the feature movie made 18 years later, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; in 1993.

The 2012 music video for the pop song &quot;Some Nights&quot; performed by Fun includes American Civil War Union soldiers serving in the regiment. The regiment is victorious in a fictional battle that portrays a young Union soldier who has left his love in Maine to serve in the regiment. During the battle, he brutally kills a Confederate soldier in hand-to-hand combat.

The 20th Maine and its color-bearer Andrew Tozier are the subjects of &quot;Ballad of the 20th Maine&quot;, a song by the Maine band The Ghost of Paul Revere; it is the official state ballad of Maine. The song &quot;Dixieland&quot; by Steve Earle and the Del McCoury Band is also about the 20th Maine.

<doc id="331633" wikidata="Q32778" url="?curid=331633" title="Bronchiectasis">
<text>Bronchiectasis is a disease in which there is permanent enlargement of parts of the airways of the lung. Symptoms typically include a chronic cough with mucus production. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and chest pain. Wheezing and nail clubbing may also occur. Those with the disease often get lung infections.
Bronchiectasis may result from a number of infectious and acquired causes, including measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis, immune system problems, as well as the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis eventually results in severe bronchiectasis in nearly all cases. The cause in 10–50% of those without cystic fibrosis is unknown. The mechanism of disease is breakdown of the airways due to an excessive inflammatory response. Involved airways (bronchi) become enlarged and thus less able to clear secretions. These secretions increase the amount of bacteria in the lungs, resulting in airway blockage and further breakdown of the airways. It is classified as an obstructive lung disease, along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed using computed tomography. Cultures of the mucus produced may be useful to determine treatment in those who have acute worsening and at least once a year.
Periods of worsening may occur due to infection. In these cases, antibiotics are recommended. Common antibiotics used include amoxicillin, erythromycin, or doxycycline. Antibiotics, such as erythromycin, may also be used to prevent worsening of disease. Airway clearance techniques, a type of physical therapy, are also recommended. Medications to dilate the airways and inhaled steroids may be used during sudden worsening, but there are no studies to determine effectiveness. There are also no studies on the use of inhaled steroids in children. Surgery, while commonly done, has not been well studied. Lung transplantation may be an option in those with very severe disease.
The disease affects between 1 per 1000 and 1 per 250,000 adults. The disease is more common in women and increases as people age. It became less common since the 1950s with the introduction of antibiotics. It is more common among certain ethnic groups (such as indigenous people in the US). It was first described by René Laennec in 1819. The economic costs in the United States are estimated at $630 million per year.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of bronchiectasis commonly include a cough productive of frequent green or yellow sputum lasting months to years. Other common symptoms include difficulty breathing, wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), and chest pain. Exacerbations of symptoms may occur, these exacerbations occur more frequently in advanced or severe disease. Systemic symptoms, including fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue and weight loss may be seen with bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis may also present with coughing up blood in the absence of sputum, which has been called &quot;dry bronchiectasis.&quot;

Exacerbations in bronchiectasis present as a worsening of cough, increasing sputum volume or thickened consistency lasting at least 48 hours, worsening shortness of breath (breathlessness), worsening exercise intolerance, increased fatigue or malaise and the development of hemoptysis.

People often report frequent bouts of &quot;bronchitis&quot; requiring therapy with repeated courses of antibiotics. People with bronchiectasis may have bad breath from active infection. On examination, crepitations and expiratory rhonchi may be heard with auscultation. Nail clubbing is a rare symptom.

The complications of bronchiectasis include serious health conditions, such as respiratory failure and atelectasis:
collapse or closure of a lung. Respiratory failure occurs when not enough oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood. Atelectasis occur when one or more segments of the lungs collapse or do not inflate properly. Other pulmonary complications include lung abscess and empyema. Cardiovascular complications include cor pulmonale, in which there is enlargement and failure of the right side of the heart as a result of disease of the lungs.

==Causes==

There are many causes that can induce or contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. The frequency of these different causes varies with geographic location. Cystic fibrosis is identified as a cause in up to half of cases. Bronchiectasis without CF is known as non-CF bronchiectasis. Historically, about half of all cases of non-CF bronchiectasis were found to be idiopathic, or without a known cause. However, more recent studies with a more thorough diagnostic work-up have found an etiology in 60 to 90% of patients.

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disease in the United States and Europe. It is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR protein, a chloride channel expressed in epithelial cells. Lung disease results from clogging of the airways due to mucus build-up, decreased mucociliary clearance, and resulting inflammation. In later stages, changes to the structure of the lung, such as bronchiectasis, occur.

=== Airway obstruction ===
An airway obstruction can be caused by either an intraluminal mass such as a tumor or a foreign body. The presence of an airway obstruction leads to a cycle of inflammation. It is important to identify the presence of an obstruction because surgical resection is often curative if obstruction is the cause. In adults, foreign body aspiration is often associated with an altered state of consciousness. The foreign body is often unchewed food, or part of a tooth or crown. Bronchiectasis that results from foreign body aspiration generally occurs in the right lung in the lower lobe or posterior segments of the upper lobe.

=== Lung infections ===
A range of bacterial, mycobacterial, and viral lung infections are associated with the development of bronchiectasis. Bacterial infections commonly associated with bronchiectasis include &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;H. influenzae&quot;, and &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. Gram-negative bacteria are more commonly implicated than gram-positive bacteria. A history of mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis can lead to damage of the airways that predisposes to bacterial colonization. Severe viral infections in childhood can also lead to bronchiectasis through a similar mechanism. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infections such as &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex are found to be a cause in some patients. Recent studies have also shown Nocardia infections to been implicated in bronchiectasis.

=== Impaired host defenses ===
Impairments in host defenses that lead to bronchiectasis may be congenital, such as with primary ciliary dyskinesia, or acquired, such as with the prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs. Additionally, these impairments may be localized to the lungs, or systemic throughout the body. In these states of immunodeficiency, there is a weakened or absent immune system response to severe infections that repeatedly affect the lung and eventually result in bronchial wall injury. HIV/AIDS is an example of an acquired immunodeficiency that can lead to the development of bronchiectasis.

=== Aspergillosis ===
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an inflammatory disease caused by hypersensitivity to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. It is suspected in patients with a long history of asthma and symptoms of bronchiectasis such as a productive, mucopurulent cough. Imaging often shows peripheral and central airway bronchiectasis, which is unusual in patients with bronchiectasis caused by other disorders.

=== Autoimmune diseases ===
Several autoimmune diseases have been associated with bronchiectasis. Specifically, individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren syndrome have increased rates of bronchiectasis. In these diseases, the symptoms of bronchiectasis usually presents later in the disease course. Other autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease also have an association with bronchiectasis. Additionally, graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation can lead to bronchiectasis as well.

=== Lung injury ===
Bronchiectasis could be caused by: inhalation of ammonia and other toxic gases, chronic pulmonary aspiration of stomach acid from esophageal reflux, or a hiatal hernia.

=== Congenital ===
Bronchiectasis may result from congenital disorders that affect cilia motility or ion transport. A common genetic cause is cystic fibrosis, which affects chloride ion transport. Another genetic cause is primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare disorder that leads to immotility of cilia and can lead to situs inversus. When situs inversus is accompanied by chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis, this is known as Kartagener&#x27;s syndrome. Other rare genetic causes include Young&#x27;s syndrome and Williams-Campbell syndrome. Tracheobronchomegaly, or Mournier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare condition characterized by significant tracheobronchial dilation and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Individuals with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency have been found to be particularly susceptible to bronchiectasis, due to the loss of inhibition to enzyme elastase which cleaves elastin. This decreases the ability of the alveoli to return to normal shape during expiration.

=== Cigarette smoking ===
A causal role for tobacco smoke in bronchiectasis has not been demonstrated. Nonetheless, tobacco smoking can worsen pulmonary function and accelerate the progression of disease that is already present.

==Pathophysiology==

The development of bronchiectasis requires two factors: an initial injury to the lung (such as from infection, auto-immune destruction of lung tissue, or other destruction of lung tissue (as seen in gastroesophageal reflux disease or aspiration syndromes)) which leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, obstruction, or a defect in host defense. This triggers a host immune response from neutrophils (elastases), reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cytokines that results in progressive destruction of normal lung architecture. In particular, the elastic fibers of bronchi are affected. The result is permanent abnormal dilation and destruction of the major bronchi and bronchiole walls.

Disordered neutrophil function is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are extracellular fibers secreted by neutrophils that are used to trap and destroy pathogens, are hyperactive in bronchiectasis. Increased NET activity is associated with more severe bronchiectasis. Neutrophil elastase, which is an extracellular protein secreted by neutrophils to destroy pathogens as well as host tissue, is also hyperactive in many cases of bronchiectasis. An increased neutrophil elastase activity is also associated with worse outcomes and more severe disease in bronchiectasis. The initial lung injury in bronchiectasis leads to an impaired mucociliary clearance of the lung airways, which leads to mucous stasis. This mucous stasis leads to bacterial colonization in bronchiectasis which leads to neutrophil activation. This neutrophil activation leads to further tissue destruction and airway distortion by neutrophils in addition to direct tissue destruction by the pathogenic bacteria. The distorted, damaged lung airways thus have impaired mucociliary clearance; leading to mucous stasis and bacterial colonization leading to further neutrophil activation and thus fueling a self-perpetuating &quot;vicious cycle&quot; of inflammation in bronchiectasis. This &quot;vicious cycle&quot; theory is the generally accepted explanation for the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis.

Endobronchial tuberculosis commonly leads to bronchiectasis, either from bronchial stenosis or secondary traction from fibrosis. Traction bronchiectasis characteristically affects peripheral bronchi (which lack cartilage support) in areas of end-stage fibrosis.

== Diagnosis ==

The goals of a diagnostic evaluation for bronchiectasis are radiographic confirmation of the diagnosis, identification of potential treatable causes, and functional assessment of the patient. A comprehensive evaluation consists of radiographic imaging, laboratory testing, and lung function testing.

Laboratory tests that are commonly part of the initial evaluation include a complete blood count, sputum cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi, testing for cystic fibrosis, and immunoglobulin levels. Additional tests that are sometimes indicated include testing for specific genetic disorders.

Lung function testing is used for the assessment and monitoring of functional impairment due to bronchiectasis. These tests may include spirometry and walking tests. Obstructive lung impairment is the most common finding but restrictive lung impairment can be seen in advanced disease. Flexible bronchoscopy may be performed when sputum studies are negative and a focal obstructing lesion is suspected.

A chest x-ray is abnormal in most patients with bronchiectasis. Computed tomography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and is also used to describe the distribution and grade the severity of the disease. Radiographic findings include airway dilation, bronchial wall thickening, and atelectasis. There are three types bronchiectasis that can be seen on CT scan, namely cylindrical, varicose, and cystic bronchiectasis.

==Prevention==
In preventing bronchiectasis, it is necessary to prevent the lung infections and lung damage that can cause it. Children should be immunized against measles, pertussis, pneumonia, and other acute respiratory infections of childhood. Additionally, parents should stay alert to keep children from inhaling objects such as pieces of food or small toys that may get stuck in small airways. Smoking and other toxic fumes and gases should be avoided by all patients with bronchiectasis to decrease the development of infections (such as bronchitis) and further complications.

Treatments to slow down the progression of this chronic disease include keeping bronchial airways clear and secretions weakened through various forms of airway clearance. Aggressively treating bronchial infections with antibiotics to prevent the destructive cycle of infection, damage to bronchi and bronchioles, and more infection is also standard treatment. Regular vaccination against pneumonia, influenza, and pertussis are generally advised. A healthy body mass index and regular doctor visits may have beneficial effects on the prevention of progressing bronchiectasis. The presence of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, dyspnea level and radiographic extent can greatly affect the mortality rate from this disease.

==Management==
A comprehensive approach to the management of bronchiectasis is recommended. It is important to establish whether an underlying modifiable cause, such as immunoglobulin deficiency or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is present. The next steps include controlling infections and bronchial secretions, relieving airway obstructions, removing affected portions of lung by surgery, and preventing complications.

=== Airway clearance ===
The goal of airway clearance therapy is to loosen secretions and interrupt the cycle of inflammation and infection. Airway clearance techniques improve difficulty breathing, cough, and help patients cough up phlegm and mucus plugs. Airway clearance usually uses an inhaled agent (hypertonic saline) with chest physiotherapy, such as high-frequency chest wall oscillation. Many airway clearance techniques and devices exist. The choice of a technique or device is based on the frequency and tenacity of phlegm, patient comfort, cost, and the patient&#x27;s ability to use the technique or device with minimal interference to their lifestyle.
The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT), which can be employed with or without a flutter device, is beneficial in treating those with bronchiectasis. Mucolytic agents such as dornase alfa are not recommended for individuals with non-CF bronchiectasis. Mannitol is a hyperosmolar agent that is thought to hydrate airway secretions, however, clinical trials with it have not demonstrated efficacy.

=== Anti-inflammatories ===
The two most commonly used classes of anti-inflammatory therapies are macrolides and corticosteroids.

Despite also being antibiotics, macrolides exert immunomodulatory effects on the host inflammatory response without systemic suppression of the immune system. These effects include modifying mucus production, inhibition of biofilm production, and suppression of inflammatory mediators. Three large multicenter, randomized trials have shown reduced rates of exacerbations and improved cough and dyspnea with use of macrolide therapy. The impact of adverse effects of macrolides such as gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatotoxicity, and increased antimicrobial resistance needs ongoing review and study.

Inhaled corticosteroid therapy can reduce sputum production and decrease airway constriction over a period of time, helping prevent progression of bronchiectasis. Long term use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids can lead to adverse consequences such as cataracts and osteoporosis. It is not recommended for routine use in children. One commonly used therapy is beclometasone dipropionate.

=== Antibiotics ===
Antibiotics are used in bronchiectasis to eradicate &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; or MRSA, to suppress the burden of chronic bacterial colonization, and to treat exacerbations. The use of daily oral non-macrolide antibiotic treatment has been studied in small case series, but not in randomized trials. The role of inhaled antibiotics in non-CF bronchiectasis has recently evolved with two society guidelines and a systematic review suggesting a therapeutic trial of inhaled antibiotics in patients with three or more exacerbations per year and &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; in their sputum. Options for inhaled antibiotics include aerosolized tobramycin, inhaled ciprofloxacin, aerosolized aztreonam, and aerosolized colistin. However, there arises a problem with inhaled antibiotic treatments, such as ciprofloxacin, of staying in the desired area of the infected lung tissues for sufficient time to provide optimal treatment. To combat this and prolong the amount of time the antibiotic spends in the lung tissue, current study trials have moved to develop inhalable nanostructured lipid carriers for the antibiotics.

=== Bronchodilators ===
Some clinical trials have shown a benefit with inhaled bronchodilators in certain people with bronchiectasis. In people with demonstrated bronchodilator reversibility on spirometry, the use of inhaled bronchodilators resulted in improved dyspnea, cough, and quality of life without any increase in adverse events. However, overall there is a lack of data to recommend use of bronchodilators in all patients with bronchiectasis.

=== Surgery ===
The primary role of surgery in the management of bronchiectasis is in localized disease to remove segments of the lung or to control massive hemoptysis. Additionally, surgery is used to remove an airway obstruction that is contributing to bronchiectasis. The goals are conservative, aiming to control specific disease manifestations rather than cure or eliminate all areas of bronchiectasis. Surgical case series have shown low operative mortality rate (less than 2%) and improvement of symptoms in the majority of patients selected to receive surgery. However, no randomized clinical trials have been performed evaluating the efficacy of surgery in bronchiectasis.

=== Clinical trials ===
Results from a phase 2 clinical trial were published in 2018. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study conducted in 256 patients worldwide, patients who received Brensocatib reported prolonged time to the first exacerbation and also reduced rate of yearly exacerbation.

==Prognosis==
Two clinical scales have been used to predict disease severity and outcomes in bronchiectasis; the Bronchiectasis Severity Index and the FACED scale. The FACED scale uses the FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), age of the affected person, presence of chronic infection, extent of disease (number of lung lobes involved) and dyspnea scale rating (MRC dyspnea scale) to predict clinical outcomes in bronchiectasis. The Bronchiectasis Severity Index uses the same criteria as the FACED scale in addition to including criteria related to number of hospital admissions, annual exacerbations, colonization with other organisms and BMI (body mass index) less than 18.5. A decreased FEV-1, increasing age, presence of chronic infection (especially pseudomonas), a greater extent of lung involvement, high clinical dyspnea scale ratings, increased hospital admissions, a high number of annual exacerbations, and a BMI less than 18.5 lead to higher scores on both clinical scales and are associated with a poor prognosis in bronchiectasis; including increased mortality.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence and incidence of bronchiectasis is unclear as the symptoms are variable. The disease affects between 1 per 1000 and 1 per 250,000 adults. The disease is more common in women and in the elderly. In a Medicare cohort study in the United States, consisting of adults 65 years and older, the prevalence of bronchiectasis was 701 per 100,000 persons. A similar prevalence rate of bronchiectasis has been reported in other countries including China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Singapore. Those with a dual COPD and bronchiectasis diagnosis are more likely to be cigarette smokers and more likely to be hospitalized as compared to those with bronchiectasis without COPD. It became less common since the 1950s, with the introduction of antibiotics. It is more common among certain ethnic groups such as indigenous people.

An estimated 350,000 to 500,000 adults have bronchiectasis in the United States. Specifically, children of the indigenous populations of Australia, Alaska, Canada and New Zealand have significantly higher rates than other populations. Overall, a shortage of data exists concerning the epidemiology of bronchiectasis in Asia, Africa, and South America.

The prevalence and incidence of bronchiectasis has increased greatly in the 21st century. In a Medicare cohort analysis, consisting of adults 65 years and older in the United States; the annual rates of diagnosis have increased by 8.7% every year between 2000 and 2007. This large increase in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis may be due to increased recognition of the disease (including more widespread use of CT scans) or it may be due to an increase in the underlying causes of bronchiectasis.

==History==
René Laennec, the man who invented the stethoscope, used his invention to first discover bronchiectasis in 1819.

The disease was researched in greater detail by Sir William Osler, one of the four founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital, in the late 1800s. It is suspected that Osler himself died of complications from undiagnosed bronchiectasis. His biographies mention that he had frequent severe chest infections for many years.

The term &quot;bronchiectasis&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;bronkhia&quot; (meaning &quot;airway&quot;) and &quot;ektasis (&quot;meaning &quot;widening&quot;).

==Society and culture==

Judith Durham of the Australian band The Seekers died of bronchiectasis on August 5, 2022, at the age of 79.

<text>Moderately prosperous society or Xiaokang society (), is a Chinese term, originally of Confucianism, used to describe a society composed of a functional middle-class. In December 1979, Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader of China, first proposed the idea of &quot;Xiaokang&quot; based on the &quot;Four Modernizations&quot;.

The term is best known in recent years through its use by Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party between 2002 and 2012, when referring to economic policies intended to realize a more equal distribution of wealth. In the usages (&quot;Tifa&quot;) of current General Secretary Xi Jinping, the term Chinese Dream has gained somewhat greater prominence. In 2015, Xi unveiled a set of political slogans called the Four Comprehensives, which include &quot;Comprehensively build a moderately prosperous society.&quot;

== Origins ==
It has been loosely translated as a &quot;basically well-off&quot; society in which the people are able to live relatively comfortably, albeit ordinarily. The term was first used in &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; written as early as 3,000 years ago. &quot;Xiaokang&quot; also appears in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;. 

== Modern political discourse ==

The vision of a &quot;xiaokang&quot; society is one in which most people are moderately well off and middle class, and in which economic prosperity is sufficient to move most of the population in mainland China into comfortable means, but in which economic advancement is not the sole focus of society. Explicitly incorporated into the concept of a &quot;Xiaokang&quot; society is the idea that economic growth needs to be balanced with sometimes conflicting goals of social equality and environmental protection.

Deng Xiaoping described a &quot;xiaokang&quot; society as a goal of the Four Modernizations. In a 1979 discussion with Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira, Deng used the concept to distinguish China&#x27;s path of development from other approaches, stating, &quot;The Four Modernizations we hope to realize are a Chinese Four Modernizations. Our conceptualization of the Four Modernizations is not like your conception of modernization, but it is a &quot;xiaokang&quot; family.&quot;

The revival of the concept of a &quot;Xiaokang&quot; Society was in part a criticism of social trends in mainland China in the 1990s under Jiang Zemin, in which many in China felt was focusing too much on the newly rich and not enough on mainland China&#x27;s rural poor. At the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2002, Jiang, set a goal of achieving comprehensive &quot;xiaokang&quot; by 2020. Hu Jintao reiterated this goal at the 17th Party Congress and the 18th Party Congress. At the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party on 1 July 2021, Xi Jinping declared that China achieved its goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

&quot;Xiaokang&quot; is also a name for a semi-monthly magazine that is affiliated to the &quot;Qiushi&quot; Magazine, the party-run magazine in Beijing. Started in 2004, it mainly focuses on the political and economic development in China.

Chinese state media has used the term &quot;&quot;Xiaokang&quot; villages&quot; to describe structures built by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army near the Line of Actual Control in its ongoing border dispute with India.
