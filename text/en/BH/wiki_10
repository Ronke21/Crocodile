<text>Nikolay Alexeyevich Nekrasov (, – ) was a Russian poet, writer, critic and publisher, whose deeply compassionate poems about the Russian peasantry made him a hero of liberal and radical circles in the Russian intelligentsia of the mid-nineteenth century, particularly as represented by Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolay Chernyshevsky. He is credited with introducing into Russian poetry ternary meters and the technique of dramatic monologue (&quot;On the Road&quot;, 1845). As the editor of several literary journals, notably &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, Nekrasov was also singularly successful and influential.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Nikolay Alexeyevich Nekrasov was born in Nemyriv (now in Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine), in the Bratslavsky Uyezd of Podolia Governorate. His father Alexey Sergeyevich Nekrasov (1788–1862) was a descendant from Russian landed gentry, and an officer in the Imperial Russian Army. There is some uncertainty as to his mother&#x27;s origins. According to Brokhaus &amp; Efron (and this corresponds with Nekrasov&#x27;s 1887 autobiographical notes), Alexandra Zakrzewska was a Polish noblewoman, daughter of a wealthy landlord who belonged to szlachta. The church records tell a different story, and modern Russian scholars have her name as Yelena Andreyevna. &quot;Up until recently the poet&#x27;s biographers had it that his mother belonged to the Polish family. In fact she was the daughter of Ukrainian state official Alexander Semyonovich Zakrevsky, the owner of Yuzvino, a small village in the Podolia Governorate,&quot; Korney Chukovsky asserted in 1967. Pyotr Yakubovich argued that the records might have been tampered with so as to conceal the fact that the girl had been indeed taken from Poland without her parents&#x27; consent (Nekrasov in his autobiography states as much). D.S.Mirsky came up with another way of explaining this discrepancy by suggesting that Nekrasov &quot;created the cult of his mother, imparted her with improbable qualities and started worshipping her after her death.&quot;

In January 1823 Alexey Nekrasov, ranked army major, retired and moved the family to his estate in Greshnevo, Yaroslavl province, near the Volga River, where young Nikolai spent his childhood years with his five siblings, brothers Andrey (b. 1820), Konstantin (b. 1824) and Fyodor (b. 1827), sisters Elizaveta (b. 1821) and Anna (b. 1823). This early retirement from the army, as well as his job as a provincial inspector, caused Aleksey Sergeyevich much frustration resulting in drunken rages against both his peasants and his wife. Such experiences traumatized Nikolai and later determined the subject matter of his major poems that portrayed the plight of the Russian peasants and women. Nekrasov&#x27;s mother loved literature and imparted this passion to her son; it was her love and support that helped the young poet to survive the traumatic experiences of his childhood which were aggravated by images of social injustice, similar to Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s childhood recollections. &quot;His was a wounded heart, and this wound that never healed served as a source for his passionate, suffering verse for the rest of his life,&quot; the latter wrote.

===Education and literary debut===

In September 1832 Nekrasov joined the Yaroslavl Gymnasium but quit it prematurely. The reasons for this might have been the alleged trouble with tutors whom he wrote satires on (no archive documents confirm this) as well as Alexey Sergeyevich&#x27;s insistence that his son should join the military academy. The biographer Vladimir Zhdanov also mentions the father&#x27;s unwillingness to pay for his children&#x27;s education; he certainly was engaged at some point in a long-drawn correspondence with the gymnasium authorities on this matter. Finally, in July 1837 he took two of his elder sons back home, citing health problems as a reason, and Nikolai had to spend a year in Greshnevo, doing nothing besides accompanying his father in his expeditions. The quality of education in the gymnasium was poor, but it was there that Nekrasov&#x27;s interest in poetry grew: he admired Byron and Pushkin, notably the latter&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Freedom&quot;.

According to some sources he was then &#x27;sent&#x27; to Saint Petersburg by his father, but Nekrasov in his autobiography maintained that it was his own decision to go, and that his brother Andrey assisted him in trying to persuade their father to procure all the recommendations required. &quot;By the age of fifteen the whole notebook [of verses] has taken shape, which was the reason why I was itching to flee to the capital,&quot; he remembered. Outraged by his son&#x27;s refusal to join the Cadet Corps, the father stopped supporting him financially. The three-year period of his &quot;Petersburg tribulations&quot; followed when the young man had to live in extreme conditions and once even found himself in a homeless shelter. Things turned for the better when he started to give private lessons and contribute to the Literary Supplement to &quot;Russky Invalid&quot;, all the while compiling ABC-books and versified fairytales for children and vaudevilles, under the pseudonym Perepelsky. In October 1838 Nekrasov debuted as a published poet: his &quot;Thought&quot; (Дума) appeared in &quot;Syn Otechestva&quot;. In 1839 he took exams at the Saint Petersburg University&#x27;s Eastern languages faculty, failed and joined the philosophy faculty as a part-time student where he studied, irregularly, until July 1841. Years later detractors accused Nekrasov of mercantilism (&quot;A million was his demon,&quot; wrote Dostoyevsky). But, &quot;for eight years (1838–1846) this man lived on the verge of starvation... should he have backstepped, made peace with his father, he&#x27;d have found himself again in total comfort,&quot; Yakubovish noted. &quot;He might have easily become a brilliant general, outstanding scientist, rich merchant, should he have put his heart to it,&quot; argued Nikolai Mikhaylovsky, praising Nekrasov&#x27;s stubbornness in pursuing his own way.

In February 1840 Nekrasov published his first collection of poetry &quot;Dreams and Sounds&quot;, using initials &quot;N. N.&quot; following the advice of his patron Vasily Zhukovsky who suggested the author might feel ashamed of his childish exercises in several years&#x27; time. The book, reviewed favourably by Pyotr Pletnyov and Ksenofont Polevoy, was dismissed by Alexey Galakhov and Vissarion Belinsky. Several months later Nekrasov retrieved and destroyed the unsold bulk of his first collection; some copies that survived have become a rarity since. &quot;Dreams and Sounds&quot; was indeed a patchy collection, but not such a disaster as it was purported to be and featured, albeit in embryonic state, all the major motifs of the later Nekrasov&#x27;s poetry.

Nekrasov&#x27;s first literary mentor Fyodor Koni who edited theatre magazines (&quot;Repertoire of Russian Theatre&quot;, then &quot;Pantheon&quot;, owned by Nikolai Polevoy), helped him debut as literary critic. Soon he became a prolific author and started to produce satires (&quot;The Talker&quot;, &quot;The States Official&quot;) and vaudevilles (&quot;The Actor&quot;, &quot;The Petersburg Money-lender&quot;), for this publication and &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;. Nekrasov&#x27;s fondness for theater prevailed through the years, and his best poems (&quot;Russian Women&quot;, &quot;The Railway&quot;, &quot;The Contemporaries&quot;, &quot;Who Is Happy in Russia?&quot;) all had a distinct element of drama to them.

In October 1841 Nekrasov started contributing to Andrey Krayevsky&#x27;s &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; (which he did until 1846), writing anonymously. The barrage of prose he published in the early 1840s was, admittedly, worthless, but several of his plays (notably, &quot;No Hiding a Needle in a Sack&quot;) were produced at the Alexandrinsky Theatre to some commercial success. In 1842 (a year after his mother&#x27;s death) Nekrasov returned to Greshnevo and made peace with his father who was now quite proud of his son&#x27;s achievements.

In 1843 Nekrasov met Vissarion Belinsky and entered his circle of friends which included Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Panayev and Pavel Annenkov. Belinsky, obsessed with the ideas of the French Socialists, found a great sympathizer in Nekrasov for whom horrors of serfdom in his father&#x27;s estate were still a fresh memory. &quot;On the Road&quot; (1845) and &quot;Motherland&quot; (1846), two of Nekrasov&#x27;s early realistic poems, delighted Belinsky. The poet claimed later that those early conversations with Belinsky changed his life and commemorated the critic in several poems (&quot;In the Memory of Belinsky&quot;, 1853; &quot;V.G.Belinsky&quot;, 1855; &quot;Scenes from The Bear Hunt&quot;, 1867). Before his death in 1848, Belinsky granted Nekrasov rights to publish various articles and other material originally planned for an almanac, to be called the &quot;Leviathan&quot;.

In the mid-1840s Nekrasov compiled, edited and published two influential almanacs, &quot;The Physiology of Saint Petersburg&quot; (1845) and &quot;Saint Petersburg Collection&quot; (1846), the latter featuring Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Poor Folk&quot;. Gathering the works of several up and coming authors (Ivan Turgenev, Dmitry Grigorovich, Vladimir Dal, Ivan Panayev, Alexander Hertzen, Fyodor Dostoyevsky among them), both books were instrumental in promoting the new wave of realism in Russian literature. Several Nekrasov&#x27;s poems found their way into the &quot;First of April&quot; compilation of humour he published in April 1846. Among the curiosities featured there was the novel &quot;The Danger of Enjoying Vain Dreams&quot;, co-authored by Nekrasov, Grigorovich and Dostoyevsky. Among the work of fiction written by Nekrasov in those years was his unfinished autobiographical novel &quot;The Life and Adventures of Tikhon Trostnikov&quot; (1843–1848); some of its motifs would be found later in his poetry (&quot;The Unhappy Ones&quot;, 1856; &quot;On the Street&quot;, 1850, &quot;The Cabman&quot;, 1855). Part of it, the &quot;St. Petersburg Corners&quot;, featured in the &quot;Physiology of St. Petersburg&quot;, was treated later as an independent novelette, an exponent of the &quot;natural school&quot; genre.

===&quot;Sovremennik&quot; and &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;===

In November 1846 Panayev and Nekrasov acquired a popular magazine &quot;Sovremennik&quot; which had been founded by Alexander Pushkin but lost momentum under Pyotr Pletnyov. Much of the staff of the old &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;, including Belinsky, abandoned Andrey Krayevsky&#x27;s magazine, and joined &quot;Sovremennik&quot; to work with Nekrasov, Panayev and Alexander Nikitenko, a nominal editor-in-chief. In the course of just several months Nekrasov managed to draw to the invigorated magazine the best literary forces of Russia. Among the works published in it in the course of the next several years were Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot;, Dmitry Grigorovich&#x27;s &quot;Anton Goremyka&quot;, Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s &quot;A Common Story&quot;, Alexander Hertzen’s &quot;Magpie the Thief&quot; and &quot;Doctor Krupov&quot;. One of the young authors discovered by Nekrasov was Leo Tolstoy who debuted in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; with his trilogy &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;Boyhood&quot; and &quot;Youth&quot;.

Nekrasov managed to save the magazine during the &#x27;Seven years of darkness&#x27; period (1848–1855) when it was balancing on the verge of closure and he himself was under the secret police&#x27; surveillance. In order to fill up the gaps caused by censorial interference he started to produce lengthy picturesque novels (&quot;Three Countries of the World&quot;, 1848–1849, &quot;The Dead Lake&quot;, 1851), co-authored by Avdotya Panayeva, his common-law wife. His way of befriending censors by inviting them to his weekly literary dinners proved to be another useful ploy. Gambling (a habit shared by male ancestors on his father&#x27;s side; his grandfather lost most of the family estate through it) was put to the service too, and as a member of the English Club Nekrasov made a lot of useful acquaintances.

In 1854 Nekrasov invited Nikolai Chernyshevsky to join &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, in 1858 Nikolai Dobrolyubov became one of its major contributors. This led to the inevitable radicalisation of the magazine and the rift with its liberal flank. In 1859 Dobrolyubov&#x27;s negative review outraged Turgenev and led to his departure from &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. But the influx of young radical authors continued: Nikolai Uspensky, Fyodor Reshetnikov, Nikolai Pomyalovsky, Vasily Sleptsov, Pyotr Yakubovich, Pavel Yakushkin, Gleb Uspensky soon entered the Russian literary scene. In 1858 Nekrasov and Dobrolyubov founded &quot;Svistok&quot; (Whistle), a satirical supplement to &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. The first two issues (in 1859) were compiled by Dobrolyubov, from the third (October 1858) onwards Nekrasov became this publication&#x27;s editor and regular contributor.

In June 1862, after the series of arsons in Petersburg for which radical students were blamed, &quot;Sovremennik&quot; was closed, and a month later Chernyshevsky was arrested. In December Nekrasov managed to get &quot;Sovremennik&quot; re-opened, and in 1863 published &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; by the incarcerated author.

In 1855 Nekrasov started working upon his first poetry collection and on 15 October 1856, &quot;The Poems by N. Nekrasov&quot; came out to great public and critical acclaim. &quot;The rapture is universal. Hardly Pushkin&#x27;s first poems, or &quot;Revizor&quot;, or &quot;Dead Souls&quot; could be said to have enjoyed such success as your book,&quot; wrote Chernyshevsky on 5 November to Nekrasov who was abroad at the time, receiving medical treatment. &quot;Nekrasov&#x27;s poems… brandish like fire,&quot; wrote Turgenev. &quot;Nekrasov is an idol of our times, a worshipped poet, he is now bigger than Pushkin,&quot; wrote memoirist Elena Stakensneider. Upon his return in August 1857, Nekrasov moved into the new flat in the Krayevsky&#x27;s house on Liteiny Lane in Saint Petersburg where he resided since then for the rest of his life.

The 1861 Manifest left Nekrasov unimpressed. &quot;Is that freedom? More like a fake, a jibe at peasants,&quot; he said, reportedly, to Chernyshevsky on 5 March, the day of the Manifest&#x27;s publication. His first poetic responses to the reform were &quot;Freedom&quot; (&quot;I know, instead of the old nets they&#x27;d invented some new ones...&quot;) and &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; (1861). The latter was originally published in the Red Books series started by Nekrasov specifically for the peasant readership. These books were distributed by &#x27;ophens&#x27;, vagrant traders, not unlike the korobeinikis Tikhonych and Ivan, the two heroes of the poem. After the second issue the series were banned by censors.

In 1861 Nekrasov started campaigning for the release of his arrested colleague, Mikhail Mikhaylov, but failed: the latter was deported to Siberia. More successful was his plea for the release of Afanasy Shchapov: the decree ordering the Petersburg historian&#x27;s demotion to a monastery was retrieved by Alexander II. After his father&#x27;s death, Nekrasov in May 1862 bought the Karabikha estate, visiting it on a yearly basis until his own death.

In April 1866, after Dmitry Karakozov&#x27;s attempt on the life of the Tsar, Nekrasov, so as to save &quot;Sovremennik&quot; from closure, wrote the &quot;Ode to Osip Komissarov&quot; (the man who saved the monarch&#x27;s life by pushing Karakozov aside) to read it publicly in the English Club. His another poetic address greeted Muravyov the Hangman, a man responsible for the brutal suppression of the 1863 Polish Uprising, who was now in charge of the Karakozov case. Both gestures proved to be futile and in May 1866 &quot;Sovremennik&quot; was closed for good.

In the end of 1866 Nekrasov purchased &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; to become this publication&#x27;s editor with Grigory Yeliseyev as his deputy (soon joined by Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin) and previous owner Krayevsky as an administrator. Among the authors attracted to the new &quot;OZ&quot; were Alexander Ostrovsky and Gleb Uspensky. Dmitry Pisarev, put in charge of the literary criticism section, was later succeeded by Alexander Skabichevsky and Nikolai Mikhaylovsky.

In 1869 &quot;OZ&quot; started publishing what turned out to be Nekrasov&#x27;s most famous poem, &quot;Who Is Happy in Russia?&quot; (1863–1876). In 1873 a group of narodniks in Geneva printed the misleadingly titled, unauthorized &quot;Collection of New Poems and Songs by Nekrasov&quot;, featuring all the protest poems banned in Russia, a clear sign of what an inspiration now the poet has become for the revolutionary underground.

===Illness and death===

For many years Nikolai Nekrasov suffered from a chronic throat condition. In April 1876 severe pains brought about insomnia that lasted for months. In June Saltykov-Shchedrin arrived from abroad to succeed him as an editor-in-chief of &quot;OZ&quot;. Still unsure as to the nature of the illness, doctor Sergey Botkin advised Nekrasov to go to the Crimea. In September 1876 he arrived at Yalta where he continued working on &quot;Who Is Happy in Russia&quot;″s final part, &quot;The Feast for All the World&quot;. Banned by censors, it soon started spreading in hand-written copies all over Russia. Already in 1875 the high-profile concilium led by Nikolay Sklifosovsky had diagnosed the intestinal cancer.

In February 1877 groups of radical students started to arrive to Yalta from all over the country to provide moral support for the dying man. Painter Ivan Kramskoy came to stay and work upon the poet&#x27;s portrait. One of the last people Nekrasov met was Ivan Turgenev who came to make peace after years of bitter feud. The surgery performed on 12 April 1877 by Theodor Billroth who was invited from Vienna by Anna Alexeyevna Nekrasova brought some relief, but not for long. &quot;I saw him for the last time just one month before his death. He looked like a corpse... Not only did he speak well, but retained the clarity of mind, seemingly refusing to believe the end was near,&quot; remembered Dostoyevsky.

Nikolai Alekseyevich Nekrasov died on 8 January 1878. Four thousand people came to the funeral and the procession leading to the Novodevichy Cemetery turned into a political rally. Fyodor Dostoyevsky delivered a keynote eulogy, calling Nekrasov the greatest Russian poet since Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. One section of the crowd, the followers of Chernyshevsky (with Georgy Plekhanov as one of their leaders), chanted &quot;No, he was greater!&quot; Members of Zemlya i Volya, alongside other radical groups (with wreaths &quot;From the Socialists&quot;), were also present. &quot;His funeral was one of the most striking demonstrations of popularity ever accorded to a Russian writer,&quot; according to Mirsky.
==Private life==

Nikolai Nekrasov met the already married Avdotya Panayeva in 1842 when she was already a promising writer and a popular hostess of a literary salon. The 20-year-old Nekrasov fell in love but had to wait several years for her emotional response and at least on one occasion was on the verge of suicide, if one of his Panayeva Cycle poems, &quot;Some time ago, rejected by you... &quot; is to be believed. For several years she was &quot;struggling with her feelings&quot; (according to Chernyshevsky), then in 1847 succumbed. &quot;This was the lucky day I count as my whole life&#x27;s beginning,&quot; wrote Nekrasov later.

The way Nekrasov moved into Panayev&#x27;s house to complete a much-ridiculed love triangle seen by many as a take on the French-imported idea of the &#x27;unfettered love&#x27; which young Russian radicals associated with the Socialist moral values. In reality the picture was more complicated. Ivan Panayev, a gifted writer and journalist, proved to be &#x27;a family man of bachelor habits&#x27;, and by the time of Nekrasov&#x27;s arrival their marriage has been in tatters. Avdotya who saw gender inequality as grave social injustice, considered herself free from marital obligations but was still unwilling to sever ties with a good friend. A bizarre romantic/professional team which united colleagues and lovers (she continued &#x27;dating&#x27; her husband, sending her jealous lodger into fits of fury) was difficult for both men, doubly so for a woman in a society foreign to such experiments.

The Panayevs&#x27; home soon became the unofficial &quot;Sovremennik&quot;″ headquarters. In tandem with Panayeva (who used the pseudonym N. N. Stanitsky) Nekrasov wrote two huge novels, &quot;Three Countries of the World&quot; (1848–1849) and &quot;The Dead Lake&quot; (1851). Dismissed by many critics as little more than a ploy serving to fill the gaps in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; left by censorial cuts and criticised by some of the colleagues (Vasily Botkin regarded such a manufacture as &#x27;humiliating for literature&#x27;), in retrospect they are seen as uneven but curious literary experiments not without their artistic merits.

Nekrasov&#x27;s poems dedicated to and inspired by Avdotya formed the Panayeva Cycle which amounted &quot;in its entirety... to a long poem telling the passionate, often painful and morbid love story,&quot; according to a biographer. It is only these poems that the nature of their tempestuous relationship could be judged by. There was a correspondence between them, but in a fit of rage Panayeva destroyed all letters (&quot;Now, cry! Cry bitterly, you won’t be able to re-write them,&quot; – Nekrasov reproached her in a poem called &quot;The Letters&quot;). Several verses of this cycle became musical romances, one of them, &quot;Forgive! Forget the days of the fall...&quot; (Прости! Не помни дней паденья...) has been set to music by no less than forty Russian composers, starting with Cesar Cui in 1859, and including Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky.

In 1849 Panayeva gave birth to a son, but the boy soon died. Another death, of Ivan Panayev in 1862, drove the couple still further apart. The main reason for Panayeva&#x27;s final departure, though, was Nekrasov&#x27;s &#x27;difficult&#x27; character. He was prone to fits of depression, anger, hypochondria and could spend days &quot;sprawling on a couch in his cabinet, greatly irritated, telling people how he hated everybody but mostly himself,&quot; according to Zhdanov. &quot;Your laughter, your merry talking could not dispel my morbid thoughts/They only served to drive my heavy, sick and irritated mind insane,&quot; he confessed in a poem.

In 1863, while still with Panayeva, Nekrasov met the French actress Celine Lefresne, who was at the time performing at the Mikhaylovsky Theatre with her troupe. She became his lover; Nekrasov, when in France, stayed in her Paris flat several times; she made a visit to Karabikha in 1867. Celine was a kindred spirit and made his journeys abroad a joy, although her attitude towards him has been described as &#x27;dry&#x27;. Nekrasov helped Celine financially and bequeathed her a considerable sum of money (10,5 thousand rubles).

In 1870 Nekrasov met and fell in love with 19-year-old Fyokla Anisimovna Viktorova, a country girl for whom he invented another name, Zinaida Nikolayevna (the original one was deemed too &#x27;simple&#x27;). Educated personally by her lover, she soon learned many of his poems by heart and became in effect his literary secretary. Zina was treated respectfully by the poet&#x27;s literary friends, but not by Anna Alexeyevna, Nekrasov&#x27;s sister who found such mésalliance unacceptable. The two women made peace in the mid-1870s, as they were bedsitting in turns for the dying poet. On 7 April 1877, in a symbolic gesture of gratitude and respect, Nekrasov wed Zinaida Nikolayevna at his home.

==Works==
Nekrasov&#x27;s first collection of poetry, &quot;Dreams and Sounds&quot; (Мечты и звуки), received some favourable reviews but was dismissed as &#x27;bland and mediocre&#x27; by Vissarion Belinsky. It was Belinsky, though, who first recognized in Nekrasov the talent of a harsh and witty realist. &quot;Do you know that you are indeed a poet, and the true one?&quot; he exclaimed upon reading the poem, &quot;On the Road&quot; (В дороге, 1845), as Ivan Panayev recalled. According to Panayev, the autobiographical &quot;Motherland&quot; (Родина, 1846), banned by censors and published ten years later, &quot;drove Belinsky totally crazy, he learnt it by heart and sent it to his Moscow friends&quot;.

&quot;When from the darkness of delusion...&quot; (Когда из мрака заблужденья..., 1845), arguably the first poem in Russia about the plight of a woman driven to prostitution by poverty, brought Chernyshevsky to tears. Of &quot;Whether I ride the dark street though the night...&quot; (Еду ли ночью по улице темной..., 1847), another harrowing story of a broken family, dead baby and a wife having to sell her body to procure money for a tiny coffin, Ivan Turgenev wrote in a letter to Belinsky (14 November): &quot;Please tell Nekrasov that... [it] drove me totally mad, I repeat it day and night and have learnt it by heart.&quot; According to literary historian D.S. Mirsky, the early verse beginning &#x27;Whether I ride the dark street through the night...&#x27;, is &quot;truly timeless... recognized by many (including Grigoryev and Rozanov) as something so much more important than just a verse – the tragic tale of a doomed love balancing on the verge of starvation and moral fall&quot;.
&quot;The Poems by N. Nekrasov&quot;, published in October 1856, made their author famous. Divided into four parts and opening with the manifest-like &quot;The Poet and the Citizen&quot; (Поэт и гражданин), it was organized into an elaborate tapestry, parts of it interweaved to form vast poetic narratives (like &quot;On the Street&quot; cycle). Part one was dealing with the real people&#x27;s life, part two satirised &#x27;the enemies of the people&#x27;, part three revealed the &#x27;friends of the people, real and false&#x27;, and part four was a collection of lyric verses on love and friendship. The Part 3&#x27;s centerpiece was &quot;Sasha&quot; (Саша, 1855), an ode to the new generation of politically minded Russians, which critics see as closely linked to Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;Rudin&quot;. In 1861 the second edition of &quot;The Poems&quot; came out (now in 2 volumes). In Nekrasov&#x27;s lifetime this ever-growing collection has been re-issued several times. The academic version of the Complete N.A. Nekrasov, ready by the late 1930s, had to be shelved due to the break out of the World War II; it was published in 12 volumes by the Soviet Goslitizdat in 1948–1953.

1855–1862 were the years of Nekrasov&#x27;s greatest literary activity. One important poem, &quot;Musings By the Front Door&quot; (Размышления у парадного подъезда, 1858), was banned in Russia and appeared in Hertzen&#x27;s &quot;Kolokol&quot; in January 1860. Among others were &quot;The Unhappy Ones&quot; (Несчастные, 1856), &quot;Silence&quot; (Тишина, 1857) and &quot;The Song for Yeryomushka&quot; (Песня Еремушке, 1859), the latter turned into a revolutionary hymn by the radical youth.

Nekrasov responded to the 1861 land reform with &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; (Коробейники, 1861), the tragicomic story of the two &#x27;basket-men&#x27;, Tikhonych and Ivan, who travel across Russia selling goods and gathering news. The fragment of the poem&#x27;s first part evolved into a popular folk song. &quot;The most melodious of Nekrasov&#x27;s poems is &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;, the story which, although tragic, is told in the life-affirming, optimistic tone, and yet features another, strong and powerful even if bizarre motif, that of &#x27;The Wanderer&#x27;s Song&#x27;,&quot; wrote Mirsky.

Among Nekrasov&#x27;s best known poems of the early 1860 were &quot;Peasant Children&quot; (Крестьянские дети, 1861), highlighting moral values of the Russian peasantry, and &quot;A Knight for an Hour&quot; (Рыцарь на час, 1862), written after the author&#x27;s visit to his mother&#x27;s grave. &quot;Orina, the Soldier&#x27;s Mother&quot; (Орина, мать солдатская, 1863) glorified the motherly love that defies death itself, while &quot;The Railway&quot; (Железная дорога, 1964), condemning the Russian capitalism &quot;built upon peasant&#x27;s bones,&quot; continued the line of protest hymns started in the mid-1840s.

&quot;Grandfather Frost the Red Nose&quot; (Мороз, Красный нос, 1864), a paean to the Russian national character, went rather against the grain with the general mood of the Russian intelligentsia of the time, steeped in soul-searching after the brutal suppression of the Polish Uprising of 1863 by the Imperial forces. &quot;Life, this enigma you&#x27;ve been thrown into, each day draws you nearer to demolition, frightens you and seems maddeningly unfair. But then you notice that somebody needs you, and all of a sudden your whole existence gets filled with the meaning; the feeling that you&#x27;re an orphan needed by nobody, is gone&quot;, wrote Nekrasov to Lev Tolstoy, explaining this poem&#x27;s idea.

In the late 1860s Nekrasov published several important satires. &quot;The Contemporaries&quot; (Современники, 1865), a swipe at the rising Russian capitalism and its immoral promoters, is considered by Vladimir Zhdanov as being on par with the best of Saltykov-Shchedrin&#x27;s work. The latter too praised the poem for its power and realism. In 1865 the law was passed abolishing preliminary censorship but toughening punitive sanctions. Nekrasov lambasted this move in his satirical cycle &quot;Songs of the Free Word&quot; (Песни свободного слова), the publication of which caused more trouble for &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. 

In 1867 Nekrasov started his &quot;Poems for Russian Children&quot; cycle, concluded in 1873. Full of humour and great sympathy for the peasant youth, &quot;Grandfather Mazay and the Hares&quot; (Дедушка Мазай и зайцы) and &quot;General Stomping-Bear&quot; (Генерал Топтыгин) up to this day remain the children&#x27;s favourites in his country.

The rise of the Narodniks in the early 1870s coincided with the renewal of interest in the Decembrist revolt in Russia. It was reflected in first &quot;Grandfather&quot; (Дедушка, 1870), then in a dilogy called &quot;Russian Women&quot; (&quot;Princess Trubetskaya&quot;, 1872; &quot;Princess M.N. Volkonskaya, 1873), the latter based upon the real life stories of Ekaterina Trubetskaya and Maria Volkonskaya, who followed their Decembrist husbands to their exile in Siberia.

In the 1870s the general tone of Nekrasov&#x27;s poetry changed: it became more declarative, over-dramatized and featured the recurring image of poet as a priest, serving &quot;the throne of truth, love and beauty.&quot; Nekrasov&#x27;s later poetry is the traditionalist one, quoting and praising giants of the past, like Pushkin and Schiller, trading political satire and personal drama for elegiac musings. In poems like &quot;The Morning&quot; (Утро, 1873) and &quot;The Frightful Year&quot; (Страшный год, 1874) Nekrasov sounds like a precursor to Alexander Blok, according to biographer Yuri Lebedev. The need to rise above the mundane in search for universal truths forms the leitmotif of the lyric cycle &quot;Last Songs&quot; (Последние песни, 1877).

Among Nekrasov&#x27;s most important works is his last, unfinished epic &quot;Who Is Happy in Russia?&quot; (Кому на Руси жить хорошо?, 1863–1876), telling the story of seven peasants who set out to ask various elements of the rural population if they are happy, to which the answer is never satisfactory. The poem, noted for its rhyme scheme (&quot;several unrhymed iambic tetrameters ending in a Pyrrhic are succeeded by a clausule in iambic trimeter&quot;) resembling a traditional Russian folk song, is regarded Nekrasov&#x27;s masterpiece.

==Recognition and legacy==

Nikolai Nekrasov is considered one of the greatest Russian poets of the 19th century, alongside Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. In the 1850s and 1860s, Nekrasov (backed by two of his younger friends and allies, Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov) became the leader of a politicized, social justice-oriented trend in Russian poetry (evolved from the Gogol-founded natural school in prose) and exerted a strong influence upon the young radical intelligentsia. &quot;What prompted the Russian student&#x27;s inclination to &#x27;merge with the people&#x27; was not Western Socialism, but the Narodnik-related poetry of Nekrasov, which was immensely popular among the young people,&quot; argued the revolutionary poet Nikolai Morozov.

In 1860 the so-called &#x27;Nekrasov school&#x27; in Russian poetry started to take shape, uniting realist poets like Dmitry Minayev, Nikolai Dobrolyubov, Ivan Nikitin and Vasily Kurochkin, among others. Chernyshevsky praised Nekrasov for having started &quot;a new period in the history of Russian poetry.&quot;

Nekrasov was credited with being the first editor of Fyodor Dostoevsky, whose debut novel &quot;Poor Folk&quot; made its way into the &quot;St. Petersburg Collection&quot; which, along with its predecessor, 1845&#x27;s &quot;The Physiology of Saint Petersburg&quot;, played a crucial role in promoting realism in Russian literature. A long-standing editor and publisher of &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, Nekrasov turned it into the leading Russian literary publication of its time, thus continuing the legacy of Pushkin, its originator. During its 20 years of steady and careful literary policy, &quot;Sovremennik&quot; served as a cultural forum for all the major Russian writers, including Dostoevsky, Ivan Turgenev, and Leo Tolstoy, as well as Nekrasov&#x27;s own poetry and prose. His years at the helm of &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, though, were marred by controversy. According to Mirsky, &quot;Nekrasov was a genius editor, and his gift for procuring the best literature and the best authors at the height of their relevancy, bordered on miraculous,&quot; but he was also &quot;first and foremost, a ruthless manipulator, for whom any means justified the end&quot; and he &quot;shamelessly exploited the enthusiasm of his underpaid authors.&quot;

The conservatives among his contemporaries regarded him a dangerous political provocateur. &quot;Nekrasov is an outright communist... He&#x27;s openly crying out for the revolution,&quot; reported Faddey Bulgarin in his letter to the Russian secret police chief in 1846. Liberal detractors (Vasily Botkin, Alexander Druzhinin, Ivan Turgenev among them) were horrified by the way &quot;ugly, anti-social things creep into his verse,&quot; as Boris Almazov has put it, and the &#x27;antipoetic&#x27; style of his verse (Grigoryev, Rozanov). &quot;The way he pushes such prosaic subject matter down into poetic form, is just unthinkable,&quot; Almazov wrote in 1852. &quot;Nekrasov most definitely is not an artist,&quot; insisted Stepan Dudyshkin in 1861.

Attacks from the right and the center-right caused Nekrasov&#x27;s reputation no harm and &quot;only strengthened [his] position as a spiritual leader of the radical youth,&quot; as Korney Chukovsky maintained. More damage has been done (according to the same author) by those of his radical followers who, while eulogizing &#x27;Nekrasov the tribune,&#x27; failed to appreciate his &#x27;genius of an innovator&#x27;. &quot;His talent was remarkable if not for its greatness, then for the fine way it reflected the state of Russia of his time,&quot; wrote soon after Nekrasov&#x27;s death one of his colleagues and allies Grigory Yeliseyev. &quot;Nekrasov was for the most part a didactic poet and as such... prone to stiltedness, mannerisms and occasional insincerity,&quot; opined Maxim Antonovich. Georgy Plekhanov who in his 1902 article glorified &#x27;Nekrasov the Revolutionary&#x27; insisted that &quot;one is obliged to read him... in spite of occasional faults of the form&quot; and his &quot;inadequacy in terms of the demands of esthetic taste.&quot;

According to one school of thought (formulated among others by Vasily Rosanov in his 1916 essay), Nekrasov in the context of the Russian history of literature was an &quot;alien... who came from nowhere&quot; and grew into a destructive &#x27;anti-Pushkin&#x27; force to crash with his powerful, yet artless verse the tradition of &quot;shining harmonies&quot; set by the classic. Decades earlier Afanasy Fet described Nekrasov&#x27;s verse as a &#x27;tin-plate prose&#x27; next to Pushkin&#x27;s &#x27;golden poetry&#x27;. Korney Chukovsky passionately opposed such views and devoted the whole book, &quot;Nekrasov the Master&quot;, to highlight the poet&#x27;s stylistic innovations and trace the &quot;ideological genealogy&quot;, as he put it, from Pushkin through Gogol and Belinsky to Nekrasov. Mirsky, while giving credit to Chukovsky&#x27;s effort, still saw Nekrasov as a great innovator who came first to destroy, only then to create: &quot;He was essentially a rebel against all the stock in trade of &#x27;poetic poetry&#x27; and the essence of his best work is precisely the bold creation of a new poetry unfettered by traditional standards of taste,&quot; Mirsky wrote in 1925.

Modern Russian scholars consider Nekrasov a trailblazer in the Russian 19th-century poetry who &quot;explored new ways of its development in such a daring way that before him was plain unthinkable,&quot; according to biographer Yuri Lebedev. Mixing social awareness and political rhetoric with such conservative subgenres as elegy, traditional romance and romantic ballad, he opened new ways, particularly for the Russian Modernists some of whom (Zinaida Gippius, Valery Bryusov, Andrey Bely and Alexander Blok) professed admiration for the poet, citing him as an influence. Vladimir Mayakovsky did as much in the early 1920s, suggesting that Nekrasov, as &#x27;a brilliant jack-of-all-trades&#x27; would have fitted perfectly into the new Soviet poetry scene.

Nekrasov enriched the traditional palette of the Russian poetry language by adding to it elements of satire, feuilleton, realistic sketch and, most importantly, folklore and song-like structures. &quot;Of all the 19th century poets he was the only one so close to the spirit of a Russian folk song, which he never imitated – his soul was that of a folk singer,&quot; argued Mirsky. &quot;What distinguishes his verse is its song-like quality,&quot; wrote Zinaida Gippius in 1939. &quot;The greatest achievement in the genre of the folk Russian song,&quot; according to Misky is the poem &quot;Who Is Happy in Russia?&quot;, its style &quot;totally original, very characteristic and monolith. Never does the poet indulge himself with his usual moaning and conducts the narrative in the tone of sharp but good-natured satire very much in the vein of a common peasant talk... Full of extraordinary verbal expressiveness, energy and many discoveries, it&#x27;s one of the most original Russian poems of the 19th century.&quot;

Nekrasov is recognized as an innovator satirist. Before him the social satire in Russia was &quot;didactic and punishing&quot;: the poet satirist was supposed to &quot;rise high above his targets to bombard them easily with the barrage of scorching words&quot; (Lebedev). Nekrasov&#x27;s dramatic method implied the narrator&#x27;s total closeness to his hero whom he &#x27;played out&#x27; as an actor, revealing motives, employing sarcasm rather than wrath, either ironically eulogizing villains (&quot;Musings by the Front Door&quot;), or providing the objects of his satires a tribune for long, self-exposing monologues (&quot;A Moral Man&quot;, &quot;Fragments of the Travel Sketches by Count Garansky&quot;, &quot;The Railroad&quot;).

What interested Nekrasov himself so much more than the stylistic experiments, though, was the question of &quot;whether poetry could change the world&quot; and in a way he provided an answer, having become by far the most politically influential figure in the Russian 19th-century literature. Vladimir Lenin considered him &quot;the great Russian Socialist&quot; and habitually treated his legacy as a quotation book which he used to flay enemies, left and right. In the Soviet times scholars tended to promote the same idea, glorifying Nekrasov as a &#x27;social democrat poet&#x27; who was &#x27;fighting for the oppressed&#x27; and &#x27;hated the rich&#x27;.

Unlike many of his radical allies, though, Nekrasov held the Orthodox Christianity and &#x27;traditional Russian national values&#x27; in high esteem. &quot;He had an unusual power of idealization and the need to create gods was the most profound of his needs. The Russian people was the principal of these gods; next to it stood equally idealized and subjectively conditioned myths of his mother and Belinsky,&quot; noted Mirsky. Nekrasov&#x27;s poetry was admired and profusely quoted by liberals, monarchists, and nationalists, as well as Socialists. Several of his lines (like &quot;Seyat razumnoye, dobroye, vetchnoye...&quot; – &quot;To saw the seeds of all things sensible, kind, eternal...&quot; or &quot;Suzhdeny vam blagiye poryvi/ No svershit nichevo ne dano&quot;. – &quot;You&#x27;re endowed with the best of intentions / Yet unable to change anything&quot;) became the commonplace aphorisms in Russia, overused in all kinds of polemics.

With verdicts upon Nekrasov&#x27;s legacy invariably depending upon the political views of reviewers, the objective evaluation of Nekrasov&#x27;s poetry became difficult. As D.S. Mirsky noted in 1925, &quot;Despite his enormous popularity among the radicals and of a tribute given to him as a poet by enemies like Grigoryiev and Dostoyevsky, Nekrasov can hardly be said to have had his due during his lifetime. Even his admirers admired the matter of his poetry rather than its manner, and many of them believed that Nekrasov was a great poet only because matter mattered more than form and in spite of his having written inartistically. After Nekrasov&#x27;s death his poetry continued to be judged along the party lines, rejected en bloc by the right wing and praised in spite of its inadequate form by the left. Only in relatively recent times has he come into his own, and his great originality and newness being fully appreciated.&quot;

===Memory===
The centenary of his birth in 1921 was marked by the publication of &quot;N.A.Nekrasov: On the Centenary of his Birth&quot; by Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii. Nekrasov&#x27;s estate in Karabikha, his St. Petersburg home, as well as the office of &quot;Sovremennik&quot; magazine on Liteyny Prospekt, are now national cultural landmarks and public museums of Russian literature. Many Libraries are named in his honor. One of them is the Central Universal Science Nekrasov Library in Moscow. Ukrainian composer Tamara Maliukova Sidorenko (1919–2005) set some of his poems to music.

<text>James Alan Bouton (; March 8, 1939 – July 10, 2019) was an American professional baseball player. Bouton played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a pitcher for the New York Yankees, Seattle Pilots, Houston Astros, and Atlanta Braves between 1962 and 1978. He was also a best-selling author, actor, activist, sportscaster and one of the creators of Big League Chew.

Bouton played college baseball at Western Michigan University, before signing his first professional contract with the Yankees. He was a member of the 1962 World Series champions, appeared in the 1963 MLB All-Star Game, and won both of his starts in the 1964 World Series. Later in his career, he developed and threw a knuckleball. Bouton authored the 1970 baseball book &quot;Ball Four&quot;, which was a combination diary of his 1969 season and memoir of his years with the Yankees, Pilots, and Astros.

==Amateur and college career==
Bouton was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Gertrude (Vischer) and George Hempstead Bouton, an executive. He grew up as a fan of the New York Giants in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, where he lived until the age of 13. He lived with his family in Ridgewood, New Jersey until he was 15, when his family relocated to Homewood, Illinois. Bouton enrolled at Bloom High School, where he played for the school&#x27;s baseball team.

Bouton was nicknamed &quot;Warm-Up Bouton&quot; because he never got to play in a game, serving much of his time as a benchwarmer. Bloom&#x27;s star pitcher at that time was Jerry Colangelo, who later would become owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Phoenix Suns. In summer leagues, Bouton did not throw particularly hard, but he got batters out by mixing conventional pitches with the knuckleball that he had experimented with since childhood. Bouton attended Western Michigan University, and pitched for the Western Michigan Broncos baseball team. He earned a scholarship for his second year. That summer, he played amateur baseball, catching the attention of scouts. Yankees scout Art Stewart signed Bouton for $30,000.

==Professional career==
Bouton signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1959. After playing in minor league baseball, Bouton started his major league career in 1962 with the Yankees, where his tenacity earned him the nickname &quot;Bulldog.&quot; By this time, he had developed a formidable fastball. He also came to be known for his cap flying off his head at the completion of his delivery to the plate, as well as for his uniform number 56, a number usually assigned in spring training to players designated for the minor leagues. (Bouton later explained that he had been assigned the number in 1962 when he was promoted to the Yankees, and wanted to keep it as a reminder of how close he had come to not making the ball club. He wore number 56 throughout most of his major league career.)

Bouton appeared in 36 games (16 starts) during the 1962 season, going 7–7 with two saves and a 3.99 ERA. He did not play in the Yankees&#x27; 1962 World Series victory over the San Francisco Giants, although he had originally been slated to start Game 7. When the game was postponed a day because of rain, Ralph Terry pitched instead. Bouton went 21–7 and 18–13 in the next two seasons, and appeared in the 1963 All-Star Game. In Game 3 of the 1963 World Series, Don Drysdale of the Los Angeles Dodgers pitched a three-hit shutout in a 1–0 victory, while Bouton gave up just four hits in seven innings for the Yankees. The only run scored in the first inning on a walk, wild pitch and single by Tommy Davis that bounced off the pitching mound.

Bouton won both his starts in the 1964 World Series. He beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2–1 with a complete-game six-hitter on October 10 on a walk-off home run by Mickey Mantle, then won again on October 14 at Busch Stadium, 8–3, backed by another Mantle homer and a Joe Pepitone grand slam. He was 2–1 with a 1.48 ERA in three career World Series starts.
Bouton&#x27;s frequent use by the Yankees during these years (he led the league with 37 starts in 1964 in addition to pitching in that year&#x27;s World Series) probably contributed to his subsequent arm troubles. In 1965, an arm injury slowed his fastball and ended his status as a pitching phenomenon. Relegated mostly to bullpen duty, Bouton began to throw the knuckleball again, in an effort to lengthen his career. He was 1–1 in 12 appearances when his contract was sold on June 15, 1968, by the Yankees to the Seattle Pilots before the expansion franchise ever played a game. He was assigned to the Seattle Angels for the remainder of the campaign. In October 1968, Bouton joined a committee of American sportsmen who traveled to the 1968 Summer Olympics, in Mexico City, to protest the involvement of apartheid South Africa.

He was used almost exclusively out of the bullpen by the Pilots in 1969. On May 16, he pitched three hitless innings of relief without allowing a run against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. The Pilots scored six in the top of the 11th inning to earn him the win, even though other Seattle relievers gave five runs back in the bottom of the 11th. Bouton earned another win in July against the Red Sox with 1 innings of relief, again not allowing a hit. Over 57 appearances with the Pilots, he compiled a 2–1 record with a 3.91 ERA.

The Pilots traded him to the Houston Astros in late August, where Bouton was 0–2 with a 4.11 ERA in 16 appearances (one start).

===&quot;Ball Four&quot;===

Around 1968, sportswriter Leonard Shecter, who had befriended Bouton during his time with the Yankees, approached him with the idea of writing a season-long diary. Bouton agreed; he had taken some notes during the 1968 season with a similar goal.

The diary that became &quot;Ball Four&quot; chronicled Bouton&#x27;s experiences the next year with the Pilots. The diary also followed Bouton during his two-week stint with the triple-A Vancouver Mounties in April, and after his trade to the Houston Astros in late August. &quot;Ball Four&quot; was not the first baseball diary (Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jim Brosnan had written two such books), but it became more widely known and discussed than its predecessors.

The book was a frank, insider&#x27;s look at professional sports teams, covering the off-the-field side of baseball life, including petty jealousies, obscene jokes, drunken tomcatting of the players, and routine drug use, including by Bouton himself. Upon its publication, baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn called &quot;Ball Four&quot; &quot;detrimental to baseball&quot;, and tried to force Bouton to sign a statement saying that the book was completely fictional. Bouton, however, refused to deny any of &quot;Ball Four&quot;&#x27;s revelations. Some teammates never forgave him for disclosing information given to him in confidence, and naming names. The book made Bouton unpopular with many players, coaches, and officials on other teams as well; he was informally blacklisted from baseball.

Bouton&#x27;s writings about Mickey Mantle&#x27;s lifestyle were most notorious, though they comprise few pages of &quot;Ball Four&quot; and much of the material was complimentary. For example, when Bouton got his first shutout win as a Yankee, he describes Mantle laying a &quot;red carpet&quot; of white towels leading directly to Bouton&#x27;s locker in his honor.

The controversy and book sales enabled Bouton to write a sequel, &quot;I&#x27;m Glad You Didn&#x27;t Take It Personally&quot;, in which he discussed both the controversies and reactions to &quot;Ball Four&quot;, and the end of his original pitching career and his transition to becoming a New York sportscaster.

===Retirement===
Bouton retired midway through the 1970 season, shortly after the Astros sent him down to the minor leagues. After a handful of unsatisfactory appearances, Bouton left baseball to become a local sports anchor for New York station WABC-TV, as part of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;; he later held the same job for WCBS-TV. In 1973, Bouton published a collection of manager tales, including one by Bouton himself about Joe Schultz his manager with the Seattle Pilots. Bouton also became an actor, playing the part of Terry Lennox in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), plus the lead role of Jim Barton in the 1976 CBS television series &quot;Ball Four&quot;, which was loosely adapted from the book. The show was canceled after five episodes. Decades later, Bouton would also have a brief one-line cameo as a pitching coach in the 2010 James L. Brooks film &quot;How Do You Know&quot;.

By the mid-1970s, a cult audience saw the book &quot;Ball Four&quot; as a candid and comic portrayal of the ups and downs of baseball life. Bouton went on the college lecture circuit, delivering humorous talks on his experiences. He authored a sequel, &quot;I&#x27;m Glad You Didn&#x27;t Take It Personally&quot;, and later updated the original book with a new extended postscript that provided a ten-year update, dubbed &quot;Ball Five&quot;.

===Return===

Bouton launched his comeback bid with the Portland Mavericks of the Class A Northwest League in 1975, compiling a 5–1 record. He skipped the 1976 season to work on the TV series, but he returned to the diamond in 1977 when Bill Veeck signed him to a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. Bouton was winless for a White Sox farm club; a stint in the Mexican League and a return to Portland followed.

In 1978, Ted Turner signed Bouton to a contract with the Atlanta Braves. After a successful season with the Double-A Savannah Braves of the Southern League, he was called up to join Atlanta&#x27;s rotation in September, and compiled a 1–3 record with a 4.97 ERA in five starts. His winding return to the majors was chronicled in a book by sportswriter Terry Pluto, &quot;The Greatest Summer.&quot; Bouton also detailed his comeback in a 10th anniversary re-release of his first book, titled &quot;Ball Four Plus Ball Five&quot;, as well as adding a &quot;Ball Six&quot;, updating the stories of the players in &quot;Ball Four&quot;, for the 20th anniversary edition. All were included (in 2000) as &quot;Ball Four: The Final Pitch&quot;, along with a new coda that detailed the death of his daughter and his reconciliation with the Yankees.

After his return to the majors, Bouton continued to pitch at the semi-pro level for a Bergen County, New Jersey team called the Emerson-Westwood Merchants, among other teams in the Metropolitan Baseball League in northern New Jersey, while living in Teaneck, New Jersey.

Once his baseball career ended a second time, Bouton became one of the inventors of &quot;Big League Chew&quot;, a shredded bubblegum designed to resemble chewing tobacco and sold in a tobacco-like pouch. He also co-authored &quot;Strike Zone&quot; (a baseball novel) and edited an anthology about managers, entitled &quot;I Managed Good, But Boy Did They Play Bad&quot; (published 1973). His most recent book is &quot;Foul Ball&quot;, a non-fiction account of his attempt to save Wahconah Park, a historic minor league baseball stadium in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The book was released in 2003 and later updated in 2005.

Although Bouton had never been officially declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; by the Yankees or any other team as a result of &quot;Ball Four&quot;″s revelations, he was excluded from most baseball-related functions, including Old-Timers&#x27; Games. It was rumored that Mickey Mantle himself had told the Yankees that he would never attend an Old-Timers&#x27; Game to which Bouton was invited. Later, Mantle denied this charge during an answering-machine message to Bouton after Mantle&#x27;s son Billy had died of cancer in 1994 – Mantle was acknowledging a condolence card Bouton had sent.

On June 21, 1998 (Father&#x27;s Day) Bouton&#x27;s oldest son Michael wrote an open letter to the Yankees, which was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which Michael described the agony of his father following the August 1997 death of Michael&#x27;s sister Laurie at age 31, with Michael wishing that the Yankees would invite Bouton to their Old Timers Game on July 25 (he noted Yogi Berra&#x27;s decision to not participate in the game as long as George Steinbrenner was owner, but he cited it as just as petty for Berra to spite Steinbrenner as it is for Steinbrenner to spite Bouton). Not long after, the Yankees elected to invite him to the Old Timers Game. On July 25, 1998, Bouton, sporting his familiar number 56, received a standing ovation when he took the mound at Yankee Stadium.

==Personal life==
Bouton and his first wife Bobbie had two children together, Michael and Laurie, and adopted a Korean orphan, Kyong Jo. Kyong Jo later changed his name to David. Bobbie and Bouton divorced in 1981. In 1983, Bouton&#x27;s ex-wife teamed up with Nancy Marshall, the former wife of pitcher Mike Marshall, to write a tell-all book called &quot;Home Games.&quot; In response to the book&#x27;s publication, Bouton commented:

We all have the right to write about our lives, and she does, too. If the book is insightful, if it helps people, I may be applauding it.
I&#x27;m sure most of the things she says are true. I smoked grass, I ran around, I found excuses to stay on the road. It got so bad that I smoked grass to numb myself. It took me a year to where my brain worked again. I no longer think of grass as harmless. We were in the death throes of a marriage. She should ask herself how did she not see these things. 

In 1997, Laurie was killed in a car accident at age 31. Bouton later married Paula Kurman. They had six grandchildren.

In 2012, Bouton had a stroke that did not impair him physically but damaged his memory and speaking.

Bouton promoted the Vintage Base Ball Federation to form vintage clubs and leagues internationally, to codify the rules and equipment of its 19th-century origins, and to organize competitions.

Bouton was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention for George McGovern.

Bouton died at home on July 10, 2019, after weeks of hospice care for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, at age 80.

<text>Louise Hoffner (born 27 October 1963), known professionally as Lou, is a German pop singer. She toured with her band for 15 years, in Germany as well as abroad.

==Eurovision==
Lou participated in the 2001 Eurovision national finals, coming in third place. Shortly before Christmas 2002, composer Ralph Siegel asked her if she would be interested in competing in the national finals again with &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Happy&quot;, a song he had written with lyricist Bernd Meinunger.

Lou won the German 2003 finals on 7 March, which qualified her to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 in Riga where she came in 11th place. In March 2006, she made a guest appearance at that year&#x27;s German Eurovision preselection, singing &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Happy&quot; in a medley of past German Eurovision entries.

==Personal life==
Lou was born in Waghäusel, the sixth child of her parents.

<doc id="324164" wikidata="Q47232" url="?curid=324164" title="Enlargement of the European Union">
<text>The European Union (EU) has expanded a number of times throughout its history by way of the accession of new member states to the Union. To join the EU, a state needs to fulfil economic and political conditions called the Copenhagen criteria (named after the Copenhagen summit in June 1993), which require a stable democratic government that respects the rule of law, and its corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the Maastricht Treaty, each current member state and the European Parliament must agree to any enlargement. The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration. This term is also used to refer to the intensification of co-operation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual harmonisation of national laws.

The EU&#x27;s predecessor, the European Economic Community, was founded with the Inner Six member states in 1958, when the Treaty of Rome came into force. Since then, the EU&#x27;s membership has grown to twenty-seven, with the latest member state being Croatia, which joined in July 2013. The most recent territorial enlargement of the EU was the incorporation of Mayotte in 2014. Campione d&#x27;Italia joined the EU Customs Union in 2020. The most notable territorial reductions of the EU, and its predecessors, have been the exit of Algeria upon independence in 1962, the exit of Greenland in 1985, and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020.

Accession negotiations are currently ongoing with Montenegro (since 2012), Serbia (since 2014), Albania (since 2020), North Macedonia (since 2020), Moldova (since 2024), and Ukraine (since 2024). Negotiations with Turkey were opened in October 2005, but have been effectively frozen by the EU since December 2016, due to backsliding in the areas of democracy, rule of law, and fundamental rights.

Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia were granted official candidate status respectively in December 2022 and December 2023, but were asked to complete additional reforms before qualifying for the formal start of membership negotiations. Kosovo submitted an application for membership in December 2022. For Kosovo to be granted official candidate status, the Council will need to unanimously agree to start Kosovo&#x27;s accession process by requesting an opinion from the European Commission on its application. The EU however remains divided on its policy towards Kosovo, with five EU member states not recognising its independence.

== Criteria ==

According to the EU treaties, membership of the European Union is open to &quot;any European State which respects the values referred to in Article 2 and is committed to promoting them&quot; (). Those values are &quot;respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.&quot; This is based on the 1993 &quot;Copenhagen criteria&quot; agreed as it became clear many former Eastern Bloc countries would apply to join:

In December 1995, the Madrid European Council revised the membership criteria to include conditions for member country integration through the appropriate adjustment of its administrative structures: since it is important that European Community legislation be reflected in national legislation, it is critical that the revised national legislation be implemented effectively through appropriate administrative and judicial structures.

Finally, and technically outside the Copenhagen criteria, comes the further requirement that all prospective members must enact legislation to bring their laws into line with the body of European law built up over the history of the Union, known as the &quot;acquis communautaire&quot;.

== Process ==

Today the accession process follows a series of formal steps, from a pre-accession agreement to the ratification of the final accession treaty. These steps are primarily presided over by the European Commission (Enlargement Commissioner and DG Enlargement), but the actual negotiations are technically conducted between the Union&#x27;s Member States and the candidate country.

Before a country applies for membership it typically signs an association agreement to help prepare the country for candidacy and eventual membership. Most countries do not meet the criteria to even begin negotiations before they apply, so they need many years to prepare for the process. An association agreement helps prepare for this first step.

In the case of the Western Balkans, a special process, the Stabilisation and Association Process exists to deal with the special circumstances there.

When a country formally applies for membership, the Council asks the commission to prepare an opinion on the country&#x27;s readiness to begin negotiations. The council can then either accept or reject the commission&#x27;s opinion (The council has only once rejected the commission&#x27;s opinion when the latter advised against opening negotiations with Greece).

If the Council agrees to open negotiations the screening process then begins. The commission and candidate country examine its laws and those of the EU and determine what differences exist. The Council then recommends opening negotiations on &quot;chapters&quot; of law that it feels there is sufficient common ground to have constructive negotiations. Negotiations are typically a matter of the candidate country convincing the EU that its laws and administrative capacity are sufficient to execute European law, which can be implemented as seen fit by the member states. Often this will involve time-lines before the Acquis Communautaire (European regulations, directives and standards) has to be fully implemented.

A chapter is said to be closed when both sides have agreed it has been implemented sufficiently, however it can still be re-opened if the Commission feels that the candidate has fallen out of compliance.

To assess progress achieved by countries in preparing for accession to the European Union, the European Commission submits regular reports (yearly) to the European Council. These serve as a basis for the council to make decisions on negotiations or their extension to other candidates.

Once the negotiations are complete, a Treaty of Accession will be signed, which must then be ratified by all of the member states of the Union, as well as the institutions of the Union, and the candidate country. Once this has been completed it will join the Union on the date specified in the treaty.

The entire process, from application for membership to membership has typically taken about a decade, although some countries, notably Sweden, Finland, and Austria have been faster, taking only a few years. The process from application for association agreement through accession has taken far longer, as much as several decades (Turkey, for example, first applied for association in the 1950s and has yet to conclude accession negotiations).

On 18 October 2019, France vetoed starting of negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, citing problems with the current enlargement process. In November 2019, France proposed a seven-stage accession plan for membership. The reformed accession strategy proposes participation in different programs, such as Erasmus, Banking Union, Capital Markets Union, Customs Union, etc.

=== Example ===
The following is an example of the accession process—Estonia&#x27;s path to membership from its restoration of independence from the Soviet Union in November 1991 with recognition from the EU the same month to membership in May 2004. Ease of accession depends on the state: how integrated it is with the EU beforehand, the state of its economy and public institutions, any outstanding political issues with the EU and (historically) how much law to date the EU has built up that the acceding state must adopt. This outline also includes integration steps taken by the accession country after it attains membership.

== Success and fatigue ==
Enlargement has been one of the EU&#x27;s successful foreign policies, yet has equally suffered from considerable opposition from the start. French President Charles de Gaulle opposed British membership. A later French President, François Mitterrand, opposed Greek, Spanish and Portuguese membership, fearing that the former dictatorships were not ready and that the countries&#x27; inclusion would reduce the union to a free-trade area.

The reasons for the first member states to apply, and for them to be accepted, were primarily economic while the second enlargement was more political. The southern Mediterranean countries had just emerged from dictatorships and wanted to secure their democratic systems through the EEC, while the EEC wanted to ensure the same thing and that their southern neighbours were stable and aligned to NATO. These two principal forces, economic gain and political security, have been behind enlargements since. After the large enlargements in 2004, public opinion in Europe turned against further expansion.

It has also been acknowledged that enlargement has its limits; the EU cannot expand endlessly. Former Commission President Romano Prodi favoured granting &quot;everything but institutions&quot; to the EU&#x27;s neighbour states, allowing them to co-operate deeply while not adding strain on the EU&#x27;s institutional framework. This has in particular been pushed by France and Germany as a privileged partnership for Turkey, membership for which has faced considerable opposition on cultural and logistical grounds.

== Historical enlargements ==


Notes:

=== Membership of EU predecessors ===

The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was proposed by Robert Schuman in his declaration on 9 May 1950 and involved the pooling of the coal and steel industries of France and West Germany. Half of the project states, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, had already achieved a great degree of integration amongst themselves with the organs of Benelux and earlier bilateral agreements. These five countries were joined by Italy and they all signed the Treaty of Paris on 23 July 1952. These six members, dubbed the &#x27;Inner Six&#x27; (as opposed to the &#x27;outer seven&#x27; who formed the European Free Trade Association who were suspicious of such plans for integration) went on to sign the Treaties of Rome establishing two further communities, together known as the European Communities when they merged their executives in 1967.

In 1962, Spain, ruled by the military dictator Francisco Franco, issued its first attempt to join the European Communities. Spanish Foreign Affairs minister Fernando María Castiella sent the request form to French Prime Minister Maurice Couve de Murville. This request was rejected by all the member countries in 1964; Spain was not a democracy at the time, and thus unable to enter the EEC.

The Community did see some loss of territory due to the decolonialisation occurring in their era. Algeria, which was an integral part of France, had a special relationship with the Community. Algeria gained independence on 5 July 1962 and hence left the Community. There would be no further efforts at enlargement until the early 1970s.

=== Enlargement of the European Communities ===

The United Kingdom, which had refused to join as a founding member, changed its policy following the Suez crisis and applied to be a member of the Communities. Other EEC members were also inclined to British membership on those grounds. French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership.

Once de Gaulle had left office, the door to enlargement was once again opened. The EEC economy had also slowed down and British membership was seen as a way to revitalise the community. Only after a 12-hour talk between British Prime Minister Edward Heath and French President Georges Pompidou took place did Britain&#x27;s third application succeed. After Britain was accepted Prime Minister Edward Heath said:

As part of the deal for British entry, France agreed to allow the EEC its own monetary resources. However France made that concession only as Britain&#x27;s small agriculture sector would ensure that Britain would be a net contributor to the Common Agricultural Policy dominated EEC budget. Applying together with the UK, as on the previous occasions, were Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. These countries were so economically linked to the UK that they considered it necessary to join the EEC if the UK did. However the Norwegian government lost a national referendum on membership and hence did not accede with the others on 1 January 1973. Gibraltar joined the Community with the United Kingdom at this point, as can be seen in the long title of the UK European Communities Act 1972.

=== Mediterranean enlargements ===

The next enlargement would occur for different reasons. The 1970s also saw Greece, Spain, and Portugal emerge from dictatorship. These countries desired to consolidate their new democratic systems by binding themselves into the EEC. Equally, the EEC was unsure about which way these countries were heading and wanted to ensure stability along its southern borders. However François Mitterrand initially opposed their membership fearing they were not ready and it would water the community down to a free trade area.

Greece joined the EEC in 1981 followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986. None of these nations had a referendum related to accession. 

The year 1985, however, saw the first time a territory voted to leave the Community, when Greenland was granted home rule by Denmark and the territory used its new powers and voted to withdraw from the Community (see member state territories).

Morocco and Turkey applied for membership in 1987. Morocco&#x27;s application was turned down as it was not considered European; Turkey&#x27;s application was considered eligible on the basis of the 1963 Ankara Association Agreement but the opinion of the Commission on the possible candidate status was by then negative. Turkey received candidate status in 1999 and began full membership negotiations in 2005, which were still in progress as of 2021.

=== Post–Cold War ===


After the 1970s, Europe experienced an economic downturn which led to leaders launching of the Single European Act which set to create a single market by 1992. The effect of this was that EFTA states found it harder to export to the EEC and businesses (including large EFTA corporations such as Volvo) wished to relocate within the new single market making the downturn worse for EFTA. EFTA states began to discuss closer links with the EEC despite its domestic unpopularity.

Austria, Finland, and Sweden were neutral in the Cold War so membership of an organisation developing a common foreign and security policy would be incompatible with that. With the end of the Cold War in 1989, that obstacle was removed, and the desire to pursue membership grew stronger. On 3 October 1990, the reunification of East and West Germany brought East Germany into the Community without increasing the number of member states.

The Community later became the European Union in 1993 by virtue of the Maastricht Treaty, and established standards for new entrants so their suitability could be judged. The Copenhagen criteria stated in 1993 that a country must be a democracy, operate a free market, and be willing to adopt the entire body of EU law already agreed upon. Also in 1993 the European Economic Area was established with the EFTA states except Switzerland. Most of the new EEA states pursued full EU membership as the EEA did not sufficiently satisfy the needs of their export based corporations. The EU has also preferred these states to integrate via the EEA rather than full membership as the EEC wished to pursue monetary integration and did not wish for another round of enlargement to occupy their attention. However, with the EEA&#x27;s credibility dented following rejection by businesses and Switzerland, the EU agreed with full membership. This was more readily accepted with the prospect of poorer countries wishing to join; contributions from richer countries would help balance the EU budget. On 1 January 1995 Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the EU marking its fourth enlargement. The Norwegian government lost a second national referendum on membership.

=== Eastern enlargement ===


In the late 1980s (shortly prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union) Mikhail Gorbachev announced the Soviet Union would no longer intervene in other countries&#x27; internal affairs (Sinatra Doctrine), practically freeing Central and Eastern Europe from Soviet occupation (Czechoslovakia and Hungary) / Soviet backed authoritarian regimes. These countries wanted to consolidate their democracies through joining Western world international organisations (including participation in European integration) which would ensure the newly emerged democracies would not fall back under Russian control. The EU and NATO offered a guarantee of this, and the EU was also seen as vital to ensuring the economic success of those countries. However, the EU&#x27;s desire to accept these countries&#x27; membership applications was less than rapid. The collapse of communism came quickly and was not anticipated. The EU struggled to deal with the sudden reunification of Germany with the addition of its poorer 17 million people and, while keeping its monetary union project on track, it was still at that early stage pointing the EFTA countries in the direction of the EEA rather than full membership.

States in Central and Eastern Europe persisted and eventually the above-mentioned issues were cleared. The US also pressured the EU to offer membership as a temporary guarantee; it feared expanding NATO too rapidly for fear of frightening Russia. Although eventually trying to limit the number of members, and after encouragement from the US, the EU pursued talks with ten countries and a change of mind by Cyprus and Malta helped to offset slightly the influx of large poorer member states from Central and Eastern Europe.

Notes:
In the end, eight Central and Eastern European countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia), plus two Mediterranean countries (Malta and Cyprus), joined on 1 May 2004. This was the largest single enlargement in terms of people, and number of countries, though not in terms of GDP. The less developed nature of these countries was of concern to some of the older member states. Some countries, such as the UK, immediately opened their job market to the accession states, whereas most others placed temporary restrictions on the rights of work of the citizens of these states to their countries. The movement westward of some of the labour force of the newly acceded countries that occurred in the aftermath of the enlargement initially spawned clichés among the public opinion and media of some western countries (such as the &quot;Polish plumber&quot;), despite the generally conceded benefit to the economies concerned. The official EU media (the speeches of the European Commission) frequently referred to the enlargement to the CEE region as &quot;an historical opportunity&quot; and &quot;morally imperative&quot;, which reflected the desire of the EU to admit these countries as members, even though they were less developed than the Western European countries.

Following this, Romania and Bulgaria, deemed as not fully ready by the commission to join in 2004, acceded instead on 1 January 2007. These, like the countries joining in 2004, faced a series of restrictions as to their citizens not fully enjoying working rights on the territory of some of the older EU members until 2014. Romania and Bulgaria did not have a referendum related to accession.

The socio-economic research on the attitudes towards the integration from both hosting and visiting countries has revealed divergent views. The analysis shows, there are a number of possible factors of the rationalisation and understanding of the practices on what the enlargement has been and should be like. Attitudes of even sceptical citizens, do not discard the possibility on future sustainable enlargements. The years subsequent to the EU accession will lead to extensive dialogues between policy-makers, governments, and European citizens about the path for a constructive development.

=== Western Balkans enlargements ===
The 2003 European Council summit in Thessaloniki set integration of the Western Balkans as a priority of EU expansion. The EU&#x27;s relations with the Western Balkans states were moved from the &quot;External Relations&quot; to the &quot;Enlargement&quot; policy segment in 2005. Those states which have not been recognised as candidate countries are considered &quot;potential candidate countries&quot;. The move to Enlargement directorate was a consequence of the advancement of the Stabilisation and Association process.

Croatia joined on 1 July 2013, following ratification of the 2011 Accession Treaty by all other EU countries. Albania and the several successor states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have all adopted EU integration as an aim of foreign policy.

== Potential enlargements ==
=== Current enlargement agenda ===
Article 49 of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended) says that any European state that respects the &quot;principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law&quot;, may apply to join the Union. The European Council set out the conditions for EU membership in June 1993 in the so-called Copenhagen criteria (see Criteria above for details). The Western Balkan states had to sign Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) before applying for membership, but have been prioritised with an open path to apply for membership and roadmap for an accession perspective, since emerging from the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and subsequent Yugoslav Wars.

Accession negotiations are currently ongoing with Montenegro (since 2012), Serbia (since 2014), Albania (since 2020), North Macedonia (since 2020), Moldova (since 2024) and Ukraine (since 2024). Negotiations with Turkey were opened in October 2005, but have been effectively frozen by the EU since December 2016, due to backsliding in the areas of democracy, rule of law, and fundamental rights.

The most advanced stage of the negotiations, defined as meeting the interim benchmarks for negotiation chapter 23 and 24 which allow the closing process of all negotiation chapters to start, has so far only been reached by Montenegro. Montenegro&#x27;s declared political goal is to achieve membership of the EU by 2028.

Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia were granted official candidate status respectively in December 2022 and December 2023, but were asked to complete additional reforms before qualifying for the formal start of membership negotiations. Kosovo submitted an application for membership in December 2022. For Kosovo to be granted official candidate status, the Council will need to unanimously agree to start Kosovo&#x27;s accession process by requesting an opinion from the European Commission on its application. The EU however remains divided on its policy towards Kosovo, with five EU member states not recognising its independence.

====EU enlargement policy====

On 6 February 2018, the European Commission published its expansion plan, which covers the six Western Balkan countries. The plan envisages that all six applicants could achieve accession as members of the European Union after 2025. In May 2018, Bulgaria—holding the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union—hosted a summit on the Western Balkans, which aimed to facilitate accession by the six, including enhanced regional security cooperation and regional connectivity.

It was noteworthy that the Summit referred to &quot;partners&quot; rather than states: this reflects that Kosovo is only partially recognised as a state. , Kosovo was not recognised by fellow Western Balkan applicant Serbia and existing EU members Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania, and Greece. The European Commission is sensitive to the issue, which was addressed in a speech by the EU&#x27;s High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the European Parliament Plenary Session on the Western Balkan Strategy: &quot;shared, unequivocal, concrete perspective for European Union integration for each and every one of the six partners. Each at its own pace, with its own specificities and under different conditions, but the direction is clear and is one.&quot;

Amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the three former Soviet republics of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia submitted applications for EU membership.
The European Parliament subsequently voted to accept an emergency petition from the government of Ukraine for EU member state candidacy. On 17 June 2022, the European Commission recommended that Ukraine and Moldova become candidates for EU membership and that Georgia be recognised as a potential candidate but that it would need to &quot;meet certain conditions&quot; to be granted candidate status. These conditions included investing more in education and infrastructure and completing several reforms in elections, judicial independence, crime, corruption, and oligarchs. These recommendations were approved by the European Council during a summit on 23 June.

On 14 December 2023, the European Council granted candidate status to Georgia, agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, and announced that the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina would be reconsidered once certain conditions were met with an update expected in March 2024. On 9 July 2024 the European Union halted Georgia&#x27;s accession into the European union after their authorities adopted a new &quot;foreign influence&quot; law which some fear might curb democratic freedom.

=== Potential enlargement agenda ===


On 12 March 2024, the European Parliament passed a resolution confirming Armenia meets Maastricht Treaty requirements and that the country may apply for EU membership. On 12 February 2025, the Armenian parliament approved a bill calling for the start of the process of Armenia&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

=== Abandoned enlargement negotiations ===
Several sovereign states have previously submitted applications for membership to the EU but are no longer on the agenda:

* Norway has completed membership negotiations twice, in 1972 and 1994, but both times membership was rejected in a referendum. The application remains frozen.
* Switzerland applied for membership in 1992 but subsequently froze its application. It formally withdrew it in 2016.
* Iceland applied in 2009 following an economic collapse, but formally withdrew in 2013 after the election of a new government.

<text>The &#x27; (abbreviated as VU Amsterdam or simply VU&quot;&quot;&#x27; when in context) is a public research university in Amsterdam, Netherlands, being founded in 1880. The VU Amsterdam is one of two large, publicly funded research universities in the city, the other being the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The literal translation of the Dutch name is &quot;Free University&quot;. &quot;Free&quot; refers to independence of the university from both the State and the Dutch Reformed Church. Both within and outside the university, the institution is commonly referred to as &quot;the VU&quot;. Although founded as a private institution, the VU has received government funding on a parity basis with public universities since 1970. The university is located on a compact urban campus in the southern Buitenveldert neighbourhood of Amsterdam and adjacent to the modern Zuidas business district.

As of October 2021, the VU had 29,796 registered students, most of whom were full-time students. That year, the university had 2,263 faculty members and researchers, and 1,410 administrative, clerical and technical employees, based on FTE units. The university&#x27;s annual endowment for 2014 was circa €480 million. About three quarters of this endowment is government funding; the remainder is made up of tuition fees, research grants, and private funding.

The official university seal is entitled &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot;. Personally chosen by Abraham Kuyper, the Reformed-Protestant leader and founder of the university, it depicts a virgin living in freedom in a garden while pointing towards God, referring to the Protestant Reformation in the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th century. In 1990, the university adopted the mythical griffin as its common emblem.

==History==
=== Origins (1880) ===
The VU was founded in 1880 by a group of Calvinists led by Abraham Kuyper as the first Protestant university in the Netherlands. Kuyper was a theologian, journalist, politician, and prime minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905. He was a professor of theology at VU as well as the university&#x27;s first &quot;rector magnificus&quot; (academic president). Kuyper&#x27;s worldview and philosophy is referred to as Neo-Calvinism. As a reflection of his beliefs, literally means &#x27;Free University&#x27; (or &#x27;Liberated University&#x27;) to signify independence from both government and church. Teaching at the started in 1880 in a few rooms rented at the Scottish Missionary Church (now the &quot;Kleine Komedie&quot; theatre), along the Amstel river in Amsterdam&#x27;s city centre. Here, Kuyper and four fellow professors began lecturing in three faculties: theology, law, and the arts.

=== Expansion (1900s–1960s) ===

In 1884, the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the growing number of students and the university bought its first building, located at Keizersgracht 162. In the following years, the university acquired more buildings throughout the city. In 1905, VU was formally accredited and granted the legal right to award academic degrees. New faculties were subsequently added to the original three, including a science faculty (1930) and a medical faculty (1950).

Funding for the university was provided through the VU Association, an organization founded by Abraham Kuyper which was firmly rooted within the Calvinist community in the Netherlands. By the end of the 1960s, the university received financial support from more than 200,000 private contributors. Many were making small coin donations collected by some 10,000 (mostly female) fundraisers, who were going door to door with the quintessential green VU collecting box.

=== Change (1970s-2000s) ===

It was in the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, that the university&#x27;s profile changed significantly in many respects. From 1968 onwards, the university relocated from Amsterdam&#x27;s city centre to a new, functional campus in the southern Buitenveldert neighbourhood. In order to strengthen academic research, university administrators decided to apply for public funding on parity with public universities, which is guaranteed under the Dutch constitution, and no longer opposed admitting non-Protestant professors and students. As a result, the number of students grew substantially. Against the background of increasing student activism at universities around the world, new student organizations were formed demanding a more democratic academic culture at VU. By the end of the 1970s, the small, elitist Christian institution had all but disappeared and had become a broad, research-oriented university, open to students of diverse backgrounds.

=== Expansion and reform (2000s–present) ===
Student numbers continued to grow rapidly in the 21st century: from 15,700 students in 2002 to about 25,000 in 2011, causing growing pains which have resulted in lower student satisfaction and budgetary constraints. The university has embarked on a reform agenda, including a large-scale renewal of campus facilities, austerity programmes and staff reorganizations, which in turn were met with opposition and legal action from trade unions as well as a newly formed grassroots movement of staff and students.

==Campus and academic life==


===Buitenveldert===
The university&#x27;s main campus and medical centre are situated in the Buitenveldert neighbourhood, part of the southern district of Amsterdam. The campus occupies about and is built along the &#x27;De Boelelaan&#x27;, a large east–west thoroughfare. Initially a fairly isolated location surrounded mostly by fields, the campus is now adjacent to the modern Zuidas business district housing some of the largest banks, accounting and law firms in the Netherlands. The VU campus is served by the 51 metro line as well as a number of tram lines and bus routes. It is also within walking distance of the Amsterdam Zuid railway station.

The university&#x27;s Main Building (&#x27;Hoofdgebouw&#x27; or HG), established in 1973, is located at the intersection of the Boelelaan and the Buitenveldertselaan. In the early 2010s, the sixteen-story building underwent major renovation works. The Main Building is home to the faculties of Arts, Social Science, Philosophy, Economics and Business, and Theology. The University Library occupies five floors as well as several floors with closed stacks. In addition, the Main Building houses the Aula (main auditorium), the university restaurant, several kiosks, a fair trade store, and the VU bookstore.

On the south side, the Main Building provides access to the campus square (&#x27;Campusplein&#x27;). Many student organizations have their offices along the campus square entrance. South of the square is the Sciences Building (&#x27;Wis- en Natuurkundegebouw&#x27; or W&amp;N), another 1970s building. The W&amp;N is housing the faculties of Sciences and Earth and Life Sciences. In the middle of campus square is The Basket, the university bar, as well as a number of volleyball fields. Recent additions to the campus square area include a campus supermarket and an Italian coffeehouse. Also adjacent to the campus square is the modern building of the Institute for Health and Welness, which has been nicknamed the Red Potato after its distinct shape and color. 

Along the Buitenveldertselaan is the Initium Building, housing the Faculty of Law. 
The arch-shaped building, opened in 2010, now forms the eastern entrance of the VU campus. The Faculty of Social Sciences is located in the Metropolitan Building, technically just off-campus, on the other side of the Buitenveldertselaan. The medical faculty is located on west end of campus, adjacent to the sprawling Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc.

In 2018, the New University Building was opened hosting teaching and research spaces as well as two caffès, an exhibition space, and a film screening space. 
===Uilenstede===
The satellite campus &#x27;Uilenstede&#x27; is located further south, in the municipality of Amstelveen. Uilenstede, built mainly between 1966 and 1970, is home to several large student housing complexes and apartment buildings and the VU Sports Centre. and a campus café. Several of the university&#x27;s administrative departments are also located at the Uilenstede campus. Uilenstede is served by tram 25 and tram 5. Many of the residential halls at Uilenstede are currently undergoing major renovation works. A new apartment complex for visiting staff and international PhD students on the eastern side of the campus was opened in 2012. The new building was awarded the municipality&#x27;s architecture prize. A large renovation of the public space, made possible with a grant from the Schiphol Foundation, started in September 2013 and includes the construction of three new squares at the campus.

==Organizational structure==
The Vrije Universiteit is made up of several faculties, responsible for teaching and research, as well as a number of interdisciplinary research institutes. As of 2015, after a number of mergers, these faculties are: Behavioural and Movement Sciences; Dentistry; Earth and Life Sciences; School of Business and Economics; Humanities; Law; Sciences; Social Sciences; Theology; and the VUmc School of Medical Sciences.

The Vrije Universiteit is formally a private institution, part of the VU-VUmc Foundation. The other main institution within this foundation is the VU University Medical Center, which has a separate management structure.

The university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. The Executive Board has general management responsibilities and appoints the deans and professors of the faculties. The Executive Board is accountable to a Supervisory Board, appointed by the members&#x27; assembly of the VU Association, a private organization which founded the university in 1880.

The university&#x27;s Works Council, a body of elected representatives of faculty and staff, as well as the Student Council, have consultation and co-decision rights in some areas of university policy and management. The College of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and chaired by the rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.

==Academic profile==
Teaching is organized within the several faculties. Together, the faculties offer 50 bachelor&#x27;s, almost 160 master&#x27;s, and a number of PhD programmes.

The language of instruction for most bachelor&#x27;s courses is Dutch. As of fall 2015, the university offers five bachelor&#x27;s programmes fully in English: Business Analytics (Faculty of Science); Computer Science (Faculty of Science); International Business Administration (School of Business and Economics); Liberal Arts and Sciences (Amsterdam University College), Literature and Society (Faculty of Humanities); and Philosophy, Politics and Economics (Faculty of Humanities). Fall 2018 the English-taught Bachelor programme History and International Studies (Faculty of Humanities) was launched. Additionally, the university-wide VU Honours Programme is taught in English.

Over 130 master&#x27;s programmes at VU are offered entirely in English. In some master&#x27;s programmes, international students outnumber the Dutch students by a large margin. The university also maintains a number of bilateral exchange agreements with foreign universities, allowing foreign students to spend one or two semesters at the Vrije Universiteit.

As with all publicly funded universities in the Netherlands, bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s students pay tuition fees determined by law. For the academic year 2015/2016, regular tuition fees for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes amount to €1,951 per year for students from the European Union or European Economic Area and €9,000 to €12,000 per year for students from non-EU/EEA countries. Most Dutch students and long-term Dutch resident EU citizens are eligible for government loans or grants to cover tuition and living expenses.

PhD programmes are organized differently. Rather than applying to the university for admission, prospective students must find a (full) professor who has a position for a PhD candidate, called a &#x27;promovendus&#x27;, and contact him or her directly. Most faculties advertise open positions on their websites. As is common in Dutch universities, &#x27;promovendi&#x27; are paid a salary and are considered university employees, therefore they do not pay tuition.

==Research==
Like teaching, research at VU is organized mostly along the lines of the ten faculties and their departments. University-wide, four interdisciplinary themes have been determined as the principal focus areas of research:
* Human Health and Life Sciences;
* Science for Sustainability, linking research on national resources with studies on the effects of human intervention, such as climate change;
* Connected World, focusing on the impact of information technology on society; and
* Professional Services, focusing on the business and finance sector and issues such as corporate social responsibility.

In addition to faculty research centres and programmes, the university houses several interdisciplinary research institutes. The Amsterdam Institute of Molecules, Medicines and Systems, founded in 2010, consists of 17 research groups in pharmaceutical sciences, life sciences, computational life sciences and molecular sciences at VU. AIMMS focusses on three programs: molecular mechanisms of biological processes, design and characterization of molecules and medicines, and Biomarkers and diagnostics. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam School of Business and Economics is also part of the Tinbergen Institute (together with Erasmus University and University of Amsterdam) for economics and finance subject research and training.

Of the nearly 3,000 academic staff (2,257 in fte) employed at VU in 2012, 42% were female. Almost 80% were of Dutch origin, while about 15% had other European nationalities. The remaining 5% came from Asia, North America, Africa, South America and Oceania. Within the body of academic staff, 29% were PhD candidates employed as junior researchers. In 2012, about 300 PhD dissertations were defended at VU.

In 2012, the European Research Council awarded two starting grants and six advanced grants to VU researchers. In addition, 11 VENI and two VICI grants were awarded within the prestigious Innovational Research Incentives Scheme by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.

In 2013, Professor Piek Vossen (Computational Lexicology) was one of three scholars awarded with the Spinoza Prize, the highest scientific award in the Netherlands.

The University Library holds a relatively large collection of more than 1,000,000 printed items. The library occupies five floors in the university&#x27;s Main Building, not including closed stacks, while the medical collection is housed at the VU University Medical Center. The library&#x27;s special collections department holds 70,000 manuscripts and printed items in 26 collections. Important collections include reformation works, original English prints, pamphlets and portraits.

==University newspaper==
The university&#x27;s independent newspaper, Ad Valvas, has been in print since 1952. The newspaper formally acquired editorial independence in 1979. &quot;Ad Valvas&quot; appeared on a weekly basis until fall 2012, when it became as a biweekly magazine. The &quot;Ad Valvas&quot; magazine focuses primarily on background stories, interviews and op-ed articles, while daily campus news is mostly provided through the newspaper&#x27;s website.

&quot;Ad Valvas&quot; is published every Thursday during the academic year, 36 times a year. In 1979, the paper acquired editorial independence and no longer had to answer to the University&#x27;s Board of Directors. From 1994 to 1999 Frank van Kolfschooten served as the editor-in-chief of the paper.

&quot;Ad Valvas&quot; had a circulation of 12,226 copies in the period of 2008-2009.

<text>Larry Martin Hagman (September 21, 1931 – November 23, 2012) was an American film and television actor, director, and producer, best known for playing ruthless oil baron J. R. Ewing in the 1978–1991 primetime television soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;, and the befuddled astronaut Major Anthony Nelson in the 1965–1970 sitcom &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Hagman had supporting roles in numerous films, including &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;, &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;, &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, &quot;Nixon&quot;, and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. His television appearances also included guest roles on dozens of shows spanning from the late 1950s until his death, and a reprise of his signature role on the 2012 revival of &quot;Dallas&quot;. Hagman also worked as a television producer and director. He was the son of actress Mary Martin. Hagman underwent a life-saving liver transplant in 1995. He died on November 23, 2012, from complications of acute myeloid leukemia.

==Early life==
Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas. His mother, Mary Martin, became a Broadway actress and musical comedy star after his birth. His father, Benjamin Jackson Hagman, who was of Swedish descent, was an accountant and lawyer who worked as a district attorney. Hagman&#x27;s parents divorced in 1936 when he was five years old. He lived with his maternal grandmother, Juanita Presley Martin, in Texas and California, while his mother became a contract player with Paramount in 1938. In 1940, Hagman&#x27;s mother met and married Richard Halliday before giving birth to a daughter, Heller, the following year. Hagman attended a strict academy, Black-Foxe Military Institute, and briefly Woodstock Country School, a boarding school in Vermont.

When his mother moved to New York City to resume her Broadway career, Hagman again lived with his grandmother in California. A few years later, his grandmother died, so Hagman joined his mother in New York City. In 1946, Hagman moved back to his hometown of Weatherford, and attended Weatherford High School, from which he graduated. One summer, he worked for oilfield-equipment maker Antelope Tool Company. Although his father wanted Hagman to become a lawyer and join his practice, he was drawn to drama classes and reportedly fell in love with the stage. He graduated from high school in 1949, and decided to pursue acting. He attended Bard College, New York, majoring in dance and drama, but dropped out after one year.

==Career==
Hagman began his career in 1950 acting in productions at Margaret Webster&#x27;s school at the Woodstock Playhouse in Woodstock, New York. That summer, during a break from his one year at Bard College, he worked in Dallas as a production assistant and acting in small roles in Margo Jones&#x27;s theater company. He appeared in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in New York City, followed by numerous tent show musicals with St. John Terrell&#x27;s Music Circus in St. Petersburg, Florida and Lambertville, New Jersey. In 1951, Hagman appeared in the London production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; with his mother and stayed in the show for nearly a year. In 1952, Hagman received his draft notice and enlisted in the United States Air Force.

Stationed in London, he spent the majority of his military service entertaining U.S. troops in the United Kingdom and at bases in Europe. After leaving the Air Force in 1956, Hagman returned to New York City, where he appeared in the off-Broadway play &quot;Once Around the Block&quot;, by William Saroyan. That was followed by nearly a year in another off-Broadway play, James Lee&#x27;s &quot;Career&quot;. His Broadway debut occurred in 1958 in &quot;Comes a Day&quot;. Hagman appeared in four other Broadway plays, &quot;God and Kate Murphy&quot;, &quot;The Nervous Set&quot;, &quot;The Warm Peninsula&quot; and &quot;The Beauty Part&quot;. During this period, he also appeared in numerous, mostly live, television programs.

Hagman&#x27;s first television role was as Kenneth Davidson in the 1957 episode &quot;Saturday Lost&quot; of the syndicated crime drama, &quot;Decoy&quot;, starring Beverly Garland as the first female police officer in a television lead. In 1958, he joined Barbara Bain as a guest star in the short-lived adventure-drama series &quot;Harbormaster&quot; and appeared three times on Lloyd Bridges&#x27; syndicated adventure series, &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;. In 1960, he was cast in the CBS summer medical series &quot;&quot; in the role of Don Harding in the episode, &quot;The Case of the Radiant Wine&quot;. In 1961, Hagman joined the cast of daytime soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; as Ed Gibson and stayed in that role for two years. In 1963 and 1964, he appeared twice in segments of the CBS legal drama, &quot;The Defenders&quot;

In 1964, he made his film debut in &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot;, the sequel to 1955&#x27;s &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. That same year, he also appeared in the Cold War thriller &quot;Fail Safe&quot;.

==&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;==

In 1965, Hagman was cast as &quot;genie&quot; Barbara Eden&#x27;s master and eventual love interest, Air Force Captain (later Major) Anthony Nelson, in the NBC situation comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, which ran for five seasons from 1965 to 1970. The show entered the top 30 in its first year and was NBC&#x27;s answer to the successful 1960s magical comedies, &quot;Bewitched&quot; on ABC and &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; on CBS. Two reunion movies were later made, both televised on NBC: &quot;I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later&quot; (1985) and &quot;I Still Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1991), but Hagman did not appear in either of them. At Dragon Con, in 2010, Hagman said he was never approached about it.

In 1999, after 29 years, Hagman agreed to reunite with &quot;Jeannie&quot; co-stars Barbara Eden and Bill Daily and creator/producer Sidney Sheldon on &quot;The Donny and Marie Show&quot;. In 2002, when &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; was set to join the cable channel TV Land, Hagman once again took part in a reunion with Eden and Daily, this time on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. On the &quot;TV Land Awards&quot; in March 2004, Hagman and Eden were the first presenters to reunite on stage. The following October, Hagman and Daily appeared at the Ray Courts Hollywood Autograph Show. And the following year, 2005, brought all three surviving stars from &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; to the first cast reunion at the Chiller Expo Show.

Hagman and Eden reunited in March 2006 for a publicity tour in New York City to promote the first-season DVD of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. He reunited once again with Eden on stage in the play &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the College of Staten Island in New York and the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. The appearance marked the first time the two performers had acted together since Eden appeared with Hagman in a five-episode arc on &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1990.

==&quot;Dallas&quot;==
In 1978, Hagman was offered two roles on two television series that were debuting. One was for &quot;The Waverly Wonders&quot; and the other for &quot;Dallas&quot;, in the role of conniving elder son and businessman J.R. Ewing. When Hagman read the &quot;Dallas&quot; script at his wife&#x27;s suggestion, they both concluded it was perfect for him. Hagman based his portrayal in part on Jess Hall Jr., the owner of Antelope Tool and Supply Company, where Hagman had worked as a young man.

&quot;Dallas&quot; became a worldwide success, airing in 90 countries, most notably the United Kingdom, where it was enjoyed even by members of the country&#x27;s royal family, and led to several successful primetime spin-offs. Hagman became one of the best-known television stars of the era. Producers were keen to capitalize on that love/hate family relationship of J.R., building anticipation to a fever pitch in &quot;A House Divided&quot;, the 1980 cliffhanger season finale in which J.R. is shot by an unknown assailant, leading to the world-wide &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; phenomenon. 

At the beginning of the fourth season later that year, audience and actors were trying to guess &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;, now one of fictional TV&#x27;s most famous questions. During the media buildup, Hagman was involved in contract negotiations, delaying his return in the fourth season. Holding out for a higher salary, Hagman did not appear in the first episode of the show until the final few minutes. Producers were faced with a dilemma of whether to pay the greatly increased salary or to write J.R. out of the program. Lorimar Productions, the makers of the series, began shooting different scenes of &quot;Dallas&quot; that did not include Hagman. In the midst of negotiations, Hagman took his family to London for their July vacation. He continued to fight for his demands and network executives conceded that they wanted J.R. to remain on &quot;Dallas&quot;. From then on, Hagman became one of the highest-paid stars in television. At the beginning of the 1980–81 season, writers were told to keep the storylines away from the actors until they really found out who actually shot J.R. and three weeks passed until the culprit was revealed on November 21, 1980, in a ratings record-breaking episode.

For his performance as J.R. Ewing, Hagman was nominated for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1980 and 1981, but did not win. He was also nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, between 1981 and 1985. He was nominated for a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; award seven times for Outstanding Villain on a Prime Time Serial, Outstanding Actor in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial, Favorite Super Couple: Prime Time and Outstanding Actor in a Comic Relief Role on a Prime Time Serial and won five times. Hagman received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement from Academy member Ray Lee Hunt at the 1981 Achievement Summit in Dallas. In 1984, co-star Barbara Bel Geddes left &quot;Dallas&quot;, following a contract dispute that had resulted from her March 1983 quadruple heart bypass surgery. At one point, Hagman suggested to his real-life mother Mary Martin that she play Miss Ellie, but she rejected the suggestion and Bel Geddes was briefly replaced by Donna Reed for the 1984–1985 season, before Bel Geddes returned in better health for the 1985–1986 season. By the end of its 14th season in 1991, ratings had slipped to the extent that CBS decided to end &quot;Dallas&quot;. Hagman was the only actor to appear in all 357 episodes. He had also made five guest appearances on the &quot;Dallas&quot; spin-off series &quot;Knots Landing&quot; in the early 1980s. Some years after &quot;Dallas&quot; ended, Hagman appeared in two subsequent &quot;Dallas&quot; television movies: &quot;&quot; in 1996 and &quot;&quot; in 1998.

Hagman reprised his role as J.R. Ewing in TNT&#x27;s continuation of &quot;Dallas&quot;, which began in 2012. In 2011, while filming the new series, Hagman said, &quot;Of course it&#x27;s fun to play the villain.&quot; As a result of Hagman&#x27;s death in 2012, his character J.R. was killed off in season two of &quot;Dallas&quot;. Unused footage of Hagman was used in season three as part of the season&#x27;s story arc, which aired in 2014.

==Other work==
===Television ===

Hagman starred in two short-lived series in the 1970s, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1971–1972) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (1973). In 1993, Hagman starred in &quot;Staying Afloat&quot; as a down-on-his-luck former millionaire who agrees to work undercover with the FBI to maintain his playboy lifestyle. Originally ordered for two TV movies and a weekly series by NBC, the pilot movie aired in November 1993 to critical drubbing and low ratings, ending production.

In January 1997, Hagman starred in a short-lived television series titled &quot;Orleans&quot; as Judge Luther Charbonnet, which lasted only eight episodes. In 2002, he made an appearance in the fourth series of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer&#x27;s British comedy panel game, &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, often appearing bewildered at the nonsensical questions and the antics of the hosts – during the show Hagman even stated that he would fire his agent as a result. In January 2011, Hagman made a guest appearance in the seventh season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as a new husband for Lynette Scavo&#x27;s mother, Stella (played by Polly Bergen).

He also directed episodes of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;The Good Life&quot;, as well as several episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, which was the only series he directed, but in which he did not act. 

===Film ===
Hagman appeared in such feature films as &quot;The Group&quot;; &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;; &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot;; &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;; &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;; &quot;Superman&quot;; &quot;S.O.B.&quot;; &quot;Nixon&quot;; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. His television work included &quot;Getting Away from It All&quot;, &quot;Sidekicks&quot;, &quot;The Return of the World&#x27;s Greatest Detective&quot;, &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot;, &quot;Checkered Flag or Crash&quot; and &quot;A Howling in the Woods&quot;

Hagman directed (and appeared briefly in) the 1972 comedy horror film &quot;Beware! The Blob&quot;, also called &quot;Son of Blob&quot;, a sequel to the 1958 horror film &quot;The Blob&quot;. It was the only feature film he directed.

===Music===
The release of a Columbia single performed with his mother Mary Martin, &quot;Get Out Those Old Records&quot;, in 1950, was credited to Mary Martin and her Son Larry, with orchestration by Mitch Miller. It was released in Australia as a-78 rpm single, catalogue number DO-3409.

In 1980, Hagman recorded a single called &quot;Ballad of the Good Luck Charm&quot;.

===Product spokesman===
During the 1980s, Hagman was featured in a national televised Schlitz beer campaign, playing on, but not explicitly featuring, the J.R. character. He wore the same kind of Western business outfit – complete with cowboy hat – that he wore in his role. The end of each 30-second spot featured a male voice-over saying, &quot;Refreshing Schlitz beer...the gusto&#x27;s back...&quot; Hagman, grinning into the camera, added: &quot;...and I&#x27;m gonna get it!&quot; He also made commercials for BVD brand underwear.

In 2010, Hagman was hired as a spokesman for SolarWorld, a German solar energy commercial enterprise. While the SolarWorld commercials specifically mention neither &quot;Dallas&quot; nor J. R. Ewing, Hagman essentially revisits the character (complete with a picture of Hagman as J. R. Ewing from the original series on the mantle), stating that his oil company days are long over, &quot;though still in the energy business&quot;, meaning solar energy, instead, which alternative energy now plays a major part of the next-generation Ewing family war between Christopher and John Ross III.

==Personal life==

In 1973, his stepfather Richard Halliday died and Hagman reconciled with his mother, Mary Martin, soon after. The two were close until her death from colon cancer in 1990.

In 1954, Hagman married Swedish-born Maj Axelsson (born May 13, 1928, in Eskilstuna, Södermanlands län, Sweden – died May 31, 2016, in Los Angeles, California); they had two children, Heidi Kristina (born 1958) and Preston (born 1962). Longtime residents of Malibu, California, they then moved to Ojai. Hagman was a member of the Peace and Freedom Party from the 1960s. Hagman derided U.S. President George W. Bush prior to the Iraq War.

In 1969, Hagman&#x27;s friend, musician David Crosby, supplied him with LSD after a concert: &quot;LSD was such a profound experience in my life that it changed my pattern of life and my way of thinking and I could not exclude it [from my autobiography].&quot; Hagman was introduced to marijuana by Jack Nicholson as a safer alternative to Hagman&#x27;s heavy drinking. &quot;I liked it because it was fun, it made me feel good and I never had a hangover.&quot; Although Hagman was a member of a 12-step program, he publicly advocated marijuana as a better alternative to alcohol.

In 1995, Hagman underwent a life-saving liver transplant after he was diagnosed with liver cancer, which was most likely brought on by roughly 40 years of heavy drinking. His clinical picture was further complicated by cirrhosis of the liver, which had been diagnosed three years earlier in 1992. Hagman did not receive preferential treatment as a celebrity, with a 1995 UPI article stating that the donor liver &quot;matched Hagman&#x27;s anonymous physical profile listed with the United Network for Organ Sharing.&quot;

He was also a heavy smoker as a young man before quitting at age 34. He was the chairman of the American Cancer Society&#x27;s annual Great American Smokeout for many years and also worked on behalf of the National Kidney Foundation.

After attending a soccer game in Bucharest between Steaua Bucharest and West Ham United, he became a well-known fan of the Romanian team.

In 2001, Hagman wrote his autobiography titled &quot;Hello Darlin&#x27;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Hagman discussed his support for alternative energy. On a 2008 episode of &quot;Living with Ed&quot;, Hagman and his wife showed actor Ed Begley Jr. their solar-powered, super-energy efficient home named &quot;Heaven&quot; and talked about their green lifestyle. Maj Hagman was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2008 and Hagman at first took the lead in caring for her, but her condition deteriorated. By 2010, she required 24-hour nursing care. As a result, Hagman put their 43-acre estate in Ojai up for sale listing it at $11 million.

==Friendship with Carroll O&#x27;Connor==
Hagman had a long friendship with actor Carroll O&#x27;Connor, beginning in 1959 when Hagman was starring in the Broadway play &quot;God and Kate Murphy&quot; and O&#x27;Connor was working as an assistant stage manager. Later, as the two struggled as young actors, they rented apartments near each other in New York. Hagman&#x27;s daughter Heidi, whom O&#x27;Connor had known since her childhood, joined the cast for one season of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. Hagman directed several episodes of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s later series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. The two remained close after the death of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s son Hugh and Hagman delivered a eulogy at the funeral.

==Illness and death==
In June 2011, Hagman said he had stage 2 throat cancer. He commented, &quot;As J. R. I could get away with anything — bribery, blackmail and adultery, but I got caught by cancer. I do want everyone to know that it is a very common and treatable form of cancer. I will be receiving treatment while working on the new &quot;Dallas&quot; series. I could not think of a better place to be than working on a show I love, with people I love.&quot; Hagman had an acorn-sized tumor removed from his tongue in 2011. In June 2012, the cancer was said to be in remission. Then, in July 2012, doctors diagnosed Hagman with myelodysplastic syndrome (formerly known as preleukemia).

Hagman died on November 23, 2012, at Medical City Dallas Hospital in Dallas following complications from acute myeloid leukemia, after being interviewed for the National Geographic documentary &quot;The &#x27;80s: The Decade that Made Us&quot;, which aired in April 2013. In a statement to the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, Hagman&#x27;s family said: &quot;Larry&#x27;s family and close friends had joined him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday. He died surrounded by loved ones. It was a peaceful passing, just as he had wished for.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of television&#x27;s most beloved villains&quot;.

==Tributes==
Actress Barbara Eden, a longtime friend of Hagman&#x27;s, who played Jeannie on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and Lee Ann de la Vega on &quot;Dallas&quot;, said: &quot;Larry was one of the most intelligent actors I ever worked with. He more than hit his marks. And when you&#x27;re working with another actor, you know immediately if the ball isn&#x27;t tossed back. Plus, Larry was savvy about the business, which I wasn&#x27;t.&quot; In an interview with Australia&#x27;s News 10, she commented that their on-screen chemistry on the set of &quot;Jeannie&quot; &quot;was not work&quot; and &quot;our timing was right. I can&#x27;t even explain it. It was wonderful.&quot;

Actress Linda Gray, who played Sue Ellen Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot;, called Hagman her &quot;best friend for 35 years&quot; and was at his bedside when he died, her agent told the BBC. In a statement, she said: &quot;He was the Pied Piper of life and brought joy to everyone he knew. He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented and I will miss him enormously. He was an original and lived life to the fullest.&quot;

Actor Patrick Duffy, who played Bobby Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot;, was also at his bedside when he died. In a statement, he said: &quot;Friday, I lost one of the greatest friends ever to grace my life. The loneliness is only what is difficult, as Larry&#x27;s peace and comfort is always what is important to me, now as when he was here. He was a fighter in the gentlest way, against his obstacles and for his friends. I wear his friendship with honor.&quot;

<doc id="324174" wikidata="Q1326780" url="?curid=324174" title="Jinggang Mountains">
<text>The Jinggang Mountains, historically rendered as Chingkang Mountains are a mountain range of the Luoxiao Mountains System, in the border region of Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces.

The range lies at the junction of four counties - Ninggang, Yongxing, Suichuan and Lingxiang. The mountains cover some , with an average elevation of above sea level. The highest point is above sea level.

The range&#x27;s massif consists of a number of thickly forested parallel ridges. On the heights there is not much farmland with most settlements at the base of the mountains. The main settlement is at Ciping, which is surrounded by five villages whose literal meanings are Big Well, Little Well, Middle Well, Lower Well, and Upper Well. Henceforth came the name of the mountain, literally means &quot;Well Ridge Mountains&quot;.

Jinggang Mountains have rich reserves of porcelain clay and rare earth ore, which are two major dominant minerals. The Jinggang Mountains are also known as “the cradle of the Chinese revolution”.

==Base of the Red Army==
The Jinggang Mountains is known as the birthplace of the Chinese Red Army, predecessor of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the &quot;cradle of the Chinese revolution&quot;. After the Kuomintang (KMT) turned against the Communist Party during the April 12 Incident, the Communists either went underground or fled to the countryside. Following the unsuccessful Autumn Harvest Uprising in Changsha, Mao Zedong led his 1,000 remaining men here, setting up his first peasant soviet.

Mao reorganised his forces at the mountain village of Sanwan in Yongxin County, consolidating them into a single regiment - the &quot;1st Regiment, 1st Division, of the First Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Revolutionary Army&quot;. Mao then made an alliance with the local bandit chieftains Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai, who had previously had little association with the Communists. For the first year he set up military headquarters at Maoping, a small market town encircled by forests guarding the main western route into the mountains. In November, the army occupied Chaling, some to the west, though this was quickly overrun by KMT troops.

When pressure from KMT troops became too great, Mao abandoned Maoping and withdrew up the mountain to Wang Zuo&#x27;s stronghold at Dajing (Big Well), from which they could control the mountain passes. That winter the Communists drilled with the local bandits and the next year incorporated them into their regular army. In February a battalion from the KMT&#x27;s Jiangxi Army occupied Xincheng, a town north of Maoping. During the night of February 17, Mao surrounded them with three battalions of his own and routed them the next day.

Zhu De and his 1000 remaining troops, who had participated in the abortive Nanchang Uprising, joined Mao Zedong toward the end of April 1928. Together the two joined forces and proclaimed the formation of the Fourth Army. Other veterans who joined the new base included Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi. The partnership between Mao Zedong and Zhu De marked the heyday of the Jinggang Mountains base area, which rapidly expanded to include, at its peak in the summer of 1928, parts of seven counties with a population of more than 500,000. Together with Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo&#x27;s forces, their soldiers numbered more than 8000. A popular story from that period recounts the hardworking Zhu De carrying grain for the troops up the mountain since agriculture was nigh impossible in the mountain range itself. It was also around this period that Mao Zedong formulated his theories of rural-based revolution and guerrilla warfare.

In July 1928, Zhu De&#x27;s 28th and 29th regiments crossed into Hunan with plans to take the important communication hub of Hengyang. Mao Zedong&#x27;s 31st and 32nd regiments were supposed to hold Maoping and Ninggang until Zhu returned. They were, however, unable to hold back the advance of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Jiangxi units and lost Ninggang and two neighbouring counties. On August 30, the young officer He Tingying managed to hold the narrow pass of Huangyangjie with a single under-strength battalion against three regiments of the Hunanese Eight Army and one regiment of Jiangxi troops, thus saving Maoping from being overrun.

As the size of the Communist forces grew and pressure grew from the Kuomintang, the Fourth Army was forced to move out. From January 14, 1929, the organisation moved to Ruijin, further south in Jiangxi province, where the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually set up. At the same time, the Kuomintang were executing another encirclement campaign, involving 25,000 men from fourteen regiments. Peng Dehuai was left in command of an 800-man-strong force, formerly the Fifth Army. By February, his remaining troops broke up under heavy attack from Wu Shang&#x27;s Hunan troops.

After the Jiangxi Soviet had established itself in southern Jiangxi, the Jinggang Mountains became the northwestern frontier of Communist operations. Peng Dehuai returned with a much stronger Fifth Army in early 1930, basing himself just north of the mountains. In late February 1930, the bandits Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were assassinated by Communist guerillas, probably on orders from officials in the Jiangxi Soviet. Their men made Wang Yunlong, Wang Zuo&#x27;s younger brother, their new leader. Most Communist forces left the area in 1934, when the Long March began. By the time they returned in 1949, Wang Yunlong had been succeeded by his son. He was charged with banditry and executed.

==Tourism==
Along with Mao Zedong&#x27;s hometown, Shaoshan, the Jinggang Mountains is one of the most important sites of the early Communist Revolution. It was celebrated on posters, songs and operas. During the Cultural Revolution, it became a place of pilgrimage for young Red Guards, who took advantage of a nationwide &quot;networking movement&quot;. They often made the journey on foot to relive the experiences of their revolutionary forebears. At its peak, more than 30,000 Red Guards arrived a day, causing terrible problems of food, housing, sanitation. Peak numbers continued for more than two months until the government began to discourage the young people.

In 1981, an area of was designated a Natural Protection Area. The next year the mountains was listed as a National Priority Scenic Area. In recent years the Jinggang Mountains has become an attraction for domestic tourists interested in revolutionary history. The scenic area was classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. According to Xinhua, tens of thousands of domestic tourists visit the mountain every year. Sites promoted by the local authorities include the mint of the Red Army, the Revolution Museum, and the Martyrs Cemetery.

In May 2004 a domestic airport was opened to attract tourists.

<doc id="324176" wikidata="Q7054693" url="?curid=324176" title="North Carolina v. Mann">
<text>North Carolina v. Mann, 13 N.C. 263 (N.C. 1830) (or State v. Mann, as it would have been identified within North Carolina), is a decision in which the Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that slave owners had absolute authority over their slaves and could not be found guilty of committing violence against them.

==Background==
Elizabeth Jones owned a slave named Lydia and she hired her out for work to John Mann of Chowan County. Mann shot and wounded Lydia when she tried to escape a lashing. Mann was found guilty of battery by a jury of twelve white men drawn from his town and the court (Superior Court Judge Joseph J. Daniel) assessed a five-dollar fine. The North Carolina Supreme Court overruled the conviction on the grounds that slaves were the absolute property of their owners who could not be punished at common law unless the legislature authorized such punishment.

==Decision==
The judgment of the state supreme court was written by Judge Thomas Ruffin, who stated that &quot;the power of the master must be absolute, to render the submission of the slave perfect&quot;, but said that slaves should have legal right of protection from persons other than their owners. Ruffin, however, made it clear that his opinion was a legal one, and that his sympathy lay with Lydia. He wrote that &quot;the struggle, too, in the Judge&#x27;s own breast between the feelings of the man, and the duty of the magistrate is a severe one, presenting strong temptation to put aside such questions, if it be possible. It is useless however, to argue of things inherent in our political state. And it is criminal in a court to avoid any responsibility which the laws impose&quot;. Harriet Beecher Stowe cited &quot;State v. Mann&quot; as a source for her depiction of slavery in her novel &quot;&quot;.

==Comparisons==

The decision has been contrasted with the British first instance decision in 1811, &quot;R v Arthur Hodge&quot;. In that case, on a charge of murdering one of his slaves, the defendant argued that an owner had absolute power over their slave to do as they will. The defense was rejected and Hodge was hanged for the murder.

The decision is also contrasted with a later North Carolina Supreme Court decision that granted slaves a limited right of self-defense against slave owners and overseers: &quot;State v. Negro Will&quot; in 1834. In that case, Judge William Gaston, writing for the court, found that a slave acting in self-defense who killed his overseer could not be found guilty of first-degree murder but at most of manslaughter.

<text>Qin Na () is the set of joint lock techniques used in the Chinese martial arts to control or lock an opponent&#x27;s joints or muscles/tendons so they cannot move, thus neutralizing the opponent&#x27;s fighting ability. &quot;Qin Na Shu&quot; ( meaning &quot;technique&quot;) literally translates as &quot;lock catch technique&quot;. Some schools simply use the word &quot;na&quot; (&quot;hold&quot;) to describe the techniques. Qinna features both standing and ground-based grappling techniques.

Some Chinese martial arts instructors focus more on their &quot;Qin Na&quot; techniques than others. This is one of the many reasons why the &quot;qinna&quot; of one school may differ from that of another. All martial arts contain &quot;qinna&quot; techniques in some degree. The southern Chinese martial arts have more developed &quot;Qin Na&quot; techniques than northern Chinese martial systems. The southern martial arts have much more prevalent reliance on hand techniques which causes the practitioner to be in closer range to their opponent. There are over 700 &quot;Qin Na&quot; traditional techniques found in all martial arts. In the Non-Temple White Crane style there are 150-200 &quot;qinna&quot; techniques alone. Along with Fujian White Crane, styles such as Northern Eagle Claw (Ying Jow Pai) and Tiger Claw (Fu Jow Pai) have &quot;qinna&quot; as their martial focus and tend to rely on these advanced techniques.

There is no universally accepted systemized form of &quot;Qin Na&quot;. Instead, each school varies depending on the instructor&#x27;s training and/or personal preference of focus.

== Techniques ==
While techniques of &quot;qinna&quot; are trained to some degree by most martial arts worldwide, many Chinese martial arts are famous for their specialization in such applications. Styles such as Eagle Claw (Yīng zhua quán 鹰爪拳), which includes 108 &quot;qinna&quot; techniques, Praying Mantis (Tánglángquán 螳螂拳), the Tiger Claw techniques of Hung Gar (洪家), and Shuai Jiao are well known examples.

&quot;Qinna&quot; can generally be categorized (in Chinese) as:

#&quot;Fen jin&quot; or &quot;zhua jin&quot; (dividing the muscle/tendon, grabbing the muscle/tendon). &quot;Fen&quot; means &quot;to divide&quot;, &quot;zhua&quot; is &quot;to grab&quot; and &quot;jin&quot; means &quot;tendon, muscle, sinew&quot;. They refer to techniques which tear apart an opponent&#x27;s muscles or tendons.
#&quot;Cuo gu&quot; (misplacing the bone). &quot;Cuo&quot; means &quot;wrong, disorder&quot; and &quot;gu&quot; means &quot;bone&quot;. Cuo gu therefore refer to techniques which put bones in wrong positions and is usually applied specifically to joints.
#&quot;Bi qi&quot; (sealing the breath). &quot;Bi&quot; means &quot;to close, seal or shut&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;, or more specifically &quot;kong qi&quot;, meaning &quot;air&quot;. &quot;Bi qi&quot; is the technique of preventing the opponent from inhaling. This differs from mere strangulation in that it may be applied not only to the windpipe directly but also to muscles surrounding the lungs, supposedly to shock the system into a contraction which impairs breathing.
#&quot;Dian mai&quot; or &quot;dian xue&quot; (sealing the vein/artery or acupressure cavity). Similar to the Cantonese dim mak, these are the technique of sealing or striking blood vessels and chi points.
#&quot;Rou dao&quot; or &quot;rou shu dao&quot; (soft techniques) which generally refers to the techniques deemed safe for sparring and/or training purposes.

&quot;Qin&quot; means to capture or lock, &quot;na&quot; means to grab or hold, and while those actions are very often executed in that order, the actions can be performed distinctly in training and self-defense: a trap isn&#x27;t always followed by a lock or break, and a lock or break is not necessarily set up by a trap.

There is quite a bit of overlap between &quot;qinna&quot; theory and technique with the branches of Traditional Chinese Medicine known as tui na (推拏) as well as the use of offensive and defensive qigong as an adjunct of &quot;qinna&quot; training in some styles.

<text>Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective that arose in the mid-20th century in answer to two theories: Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner&#x27;s behaviorism. Thus, Abraham Maslow established the need for a &quot;third force&quot; in psychology. The school of thought of humanistic psychology gained traction due to Maslow in the 1950s.

Some elements of humanistic psychology are

* to understand people, ourselves and others holistically (as wholes greater than the sums of their parts)
* to acknowledge the relevance and significance of the full life history of an individual
* to acknowledge the importance of intentionality in human existence
* to recognize the importance of an end goal of life for a healthy person

Humanistic psychology also acknowledges spiritual aspiration as an integral part of the psyche. It is linked to the emerging field of transpersonal psychology.

Primarily, humanistic therapy encourages a self-awareness and reflexivity that helps the client change their state of mind and behavior from one set of reactions to a healthier one with more productive and thoughtful actions. Essentially, this approach allows the merging of mindfulness and behavioral therapy, with positive social support.

In an article from the Association for Humanistic Psychology, the benefits of humanistic therapy are described as having a &quot;crucial opportunity to lead our troubled culture back to its own healthy path. More than any other therapy, Humanistic-Existential therapy models democracy. It imposes ideologies of others upon the client less than other therapeutic practices. Freedom to choose is maximized. We validate our clients&#x27; human potential.&quot;

In the 20th century, humanistic psychology was referred to as the &quot;third force&quot; in psychology, distinct from earlier, less humanistic approaches of psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

Its principal professional organizations in the US are the Association for Humanistic Psychology and the Society for Humanistic Psychology (Division 32 of the American Psychological Association). In Britain, there is the UK Association for Humanistic Psychology Practitioners.

== Differences with psychoanalytic theory and behaviorism ==
Through disagreement with the predominant theories at the time, developed by Freud and Skinner, Maslow was able to formulate the main points of humanistic theory.

Maslow had the following criticisms of the two main theories at the time:

# Freud&#x27;s theory was deterministic, meaning that it attributed the behavior of people to unconscious desires.
# Freud and Skinner&#x27;s theories focused on individuals with mental conflicts (pathological) rather than all individuals.
# The other two theories focused too much on the negative traits of human beings, rather than focusing on the positive power Maslow believed individuals to have.

As a result, when Maslow developed his theory, he decided to focus on the conscious (rather than the unconscious) and decided to develop a new theory to explain how all individuals could reach their highest potential.

==Origins==
One of humanistic psychology&#x27;s early sources was the work of Carl Rogers, who was strongly influenced by Otto Rank, who broke with Freud in the mid-1920s. Rogers&#x27; focus was to ensure that the developmental processes led to healthier, if not more creative, personality functioning. The term &#x27;actualizing tendency&#x27; was also coined by Rogers, and was a concept that eventually led Abraham Maslow to study self-actualization as one of the needs of humans. Rogers and Maslow introduced this positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis.

The other sources of inspiration include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology.

=== Conceptual origins ===
Whilst origins of humanistic psychology date back to the early 1960s, the origins of humanism date back to the classical civilizations of China, Greece, and Rome, whose values were renewed in the European Renaissance.
The modern humanistic approach has its roots in phenomenological and existentialist thought (see Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre). Eastern philosophy and psychology also play a central role in humanistic psychology, as well as Judeo-Christian philosophies of personalism, as each shares similar concerns about the nature of human existence and consciousness.
For further information on influential figures in personalism, see: Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev, Emmanuel Mounier, Gabriel Marcel, Denis de Rougemont, Jacques Maritain, Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, Max Scheler and Karol Wojtyla.

As behaviorism grew out of Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s work with the conditioned reflex, and laid the foundations for academic psychology in the United States associated with the names of John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner; Abraham Maslow gave behaviorism the name &quot;the first force&quot;, a force which systematically excluded the subjective data of consciousness and much information bearing on the complexity of the human personality and its development. Behavioral theory continued to develop to both account for simple and complex human behavior through theorists such as Arthur Staats, Steven Hayes, and other post-Skinnerian researchers. Clinical behavioral analysis continues to be widely employed in anxiety disorder treatments, mood disorders, and even personality disorders.

The &quot;second force&quot; arose out of Freudian psychoanalysis, which were composed by psychologists like Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, Melanie Klein, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Sigmund Freud himself. Maslow then emphasized the necessity of a &quot;third force&quot; (even though he did not use the term), saying that &quot;it is as if Freud supplied us the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half&quot;, as a critical review towards the cold and distant approach of the psychoanalysis and its deterministic way of viewing the human being.

In the late 1930s, psychologists, interested in the uniquely human issues, such as the self, self-actualization, health, hope, love, creativity, nature, being, becoming, individuality, and meaning—that is, a concrete understanding of human existence—included Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Clark Moustakas, who were interested in founding a professional association dedicated to a psychology focused on these features of human capital demanded by post-industrial society.

The humanistic psychology perspective is summarized by five core principles or &quot;postulates&quot; of humanistic psychology first articulated in an article written by James Bugental in 1964 and adapted by Tom Greening, psychologist and long-time editor of the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;. The five basic principles of humanistic psychology are:

# Human beings, as human, supersede the sum of their parts. They cannot be reduced to components.
# Human beings have their existence in a uniquely human context, as well as in a cosmic ecology.
# Human beings are aware and are aware of being aware—i.e., they are conscious. Human consciousness always includes an awareness of oneself in the context of other people.
# Human beings have the ability to make choices and therefore have responsibility.
# Human beings are intentional, aim at goals, are aware that they cause future events, and seek meaning, value, and creativity.

While humanistic psychology is a specific division within the American Psychological Association (Division 32), humanistic psychology is not so much a &quot;discipline&quot; within psychology as a &quot;perspective&quot; on the human condition that informs psychological research and practice.

=== Practical origins ===

WWII created practical pressures on military psychologists, they had more patients to see and care for than time or resources permitted. The origins of group therapy are here. Eric Berne&#x27;s progression of books shows this transition out of what we might call pragmatic psychology of WWII into his later innovation, Transactional Analysis, one of the most influential forms of humanistic Popular Psychology of the later 1960s-1970. Even though transactional analysis was considered a unique methodology, it was challenged after Berne&#x27;s death.

== Orientation to scientific research ==

Humanistic psychologists generally do not believe that we will understand human consciousness and behavior through mainstream scientific research. The objection that humanistic psychologists have to traditional research methods is that they are derived from and suited for the physical sciences and not especially appropriate to studying the complexities and nuances of human meaning-making.

However, humanistic psychology has involved scientific research of human behavior since its inception. For example:
* Abraham Maslow proposed many of his theories of human growth in the form of testable hypotheses, and he encouraged scientists to put them to the test.
* Shortly after the founding of the American Association of Humanistic Psychology, its president, psychologist Sidney Jourard, began his column by declaring that &quot;research&quot; is a priority. &quot;Humanistic Psychology will be best served if it is &quot;undergirded with research&quot; that seeks to throw light on the qualities of man that are uniquely human&quot; (emphasis added)
* In May 1966, the AAHP release a newsletter editorial that confirmed the humanistic psychologist&#x27;s &quot;allegiance to meaningfulness in the selection of problems for study and of research procedures, and an opposition to a primary emphasis on objectivity at the expense of significance.&quot; This underscored the importance of research to humanistic psychologists as well as their interest in special forms of human science investigation.
* Likewise, in 1980, the American Psychological Association&#x27;s publication for humanistic psychology (Division 32 of APA) ran an article titled, &quot;What makes research humanistic?&quot; As Donald Polkinghorne notes, &quot;Humanistic theory does not propose that human action is completely independent of the environment or the mechanical and organic orders of the body, but it does suggest that, within the limits of experienced meanings, persons as unities can choose to act in ways not determined by prior events...and this is the theory we seek to test through our research&quot; (p. 3).

A human science view is not opposed to quantitative methods, but, following Edmund Husserl:
# favors letting the methods be derived from the subject matter and not uncritically adopting the methods of natural science, and
# advocates for methodological pluralism. Consequently, much of the subject matter of psychology lends itself to qualitative approaches (e.g. the lived experience of grief), and quantitative methods are mainly appropriate when something can be counted without leveling the phenomena (e.g. the length of time spent crying).

Research has remained part of the humanistic psychology agenda, though with more of a holistic than reductionistic focus. Specific humanistic research methods evolved in the decades following the formation of the humanistic psychology movement.

==Development of the field==
=== Saybrook Conference ===
In November 1964 key figures in the movement gathered at Old Saybrook (CT) for the &quot;first invitational conference on Humanistic psychology&quot;. The meeting was a co-operation between the Association for Humanistic Psychology (AHP), which sponsored the conference, the Hazen Foundation, which provided financing, and Wesleyan University, which hosted the meeting. In addition to the founding figures of Humanistic psychology; Abraham Maslow, Rollo May, James Bugental and Carl Rogers, the meeting attracted several academic profiles from the humanistic disciplines, including: Gordon Allport, George Kelly, Clark Moustakas, Gardner Murphy, Henry Murray, Robert W. White, Charlotte Bühler, Floyd Matson, Jacques Barzun, and René Dubos. Robert Knapp was chairman and Henry Murray gave the keynote address.

Among the intentions of the participants was to formulate a new vision for psychology that, in their view, took into consideration a more complete image of the person than the image presented by the current trends of Behaviorism and Freudian psychology. According to Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening the participants took issue with the positivistic trend in mainstream psychology at the time. The conference has been described as a historic event that was important for the academic status of Humanistic psychology and its future aspirations.

=== Major theorists ===
Several key theorists have been considered to have prepared the ground for humanistic psychology. These theorists include Otto Rank, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers and Rollo May. This section provides a short-handed summary of each individual&#x27;s contributions for the theory.

Abraham Maslow: In regards to humanistic theory, Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs. This is a pyramid which basically states that individuals first must have their physiological needs met, then safety, then love, then self-esteem and lastly self-actualization. People who have met their self-actualization needs are self-aware, caring, wise and their interests are problem centered. He theorized that self-actualizing people are continuously striving, thinking broadly and focusing on broader problems. He also believed however, that only 1% of people actually achieved self-actualization.

Carl Rogers: Rogers built upon Maslow&#x27;s theory and argued that the process of self-actualization is nurtured in a growth promoting climate. Two conditions are required in order for a climate to be a self-actualizing growth promoting climate: the individual must be able to be their genuine self, and as the individual expresses their true self, they must be accepted by others.

==Counseling and therapy==
The aim of humanistic therapy is usually to help the client develop a stronger and healthier sense of self, also called self-actualization. Humanistic therapy attempts to teach clients that they have potential for self-fulfillment. This type of therapy is insight-based, meaning that the therapist attempts to provide the client with insights about their inner conflicts.

===Approaches===
Humanistic psychology includes several approaches to counseling and therapy. Among the earliest approaches we find the developmental theory of Abraham Maslow, emphasizing a hierarchy of needs and motivations; the existential psychology of Rollo May acknowledging human choice and the tragic aspects of human existence; and the person-centered or client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers, which is centered on the client&#x27;s capacity for self-direction and understanding of his or her own development. Client-centered therapy is non-directive; the therapist listens to the client without judgement, allowing the client to come to insights by themselves. The therapist should ensure that all of the client&#x27;s feelings are being considered and that the therapist has a firm grasp on the concerns of the client while ensuring that there is an air of acceptance and warmth. Client-centered therapist engages in active listening during therapy sessions.

A therapist cannot be completely non-directive; however, a nonjudgmental, accepting environment that provides unconditional positive regard will encourage feelings of acceptance and value.

Existential psychotherapies, an application of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans have the freedom to make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves and do whatever it is they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.

Another approach to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts a focus on the here and now, especially as an opportunity to look past any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.

Also part of the range of humanistic psychotherapy are concepts from depth therapy, holistic health, encounter groups, sensitivity training, marital and family therapies, body work, the existential psychotherapy of Medard Boss, and positive psychology.

===Empathy and self-help===
Empathy is one of the most important features of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist&#x27;s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard is one of the key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers&#x27; students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.

Self-help is also part of humanistic psychology: Sheila Ernst and Lucy Goodison have described using some of the main humanistic approaches in self-help groups. Humanistic Psychology is applicable to self-help because it is oriented towards changing the way a person thinks. One can only improve once they decide to change their ways of thinking about themselves, once they decide to help themselves. Co-counselling, which is an approach based purely on self-help, is regarded as coming from humanistic psychology as well. Humanistic theory has had a strong influence on other forms of popular therapy, including Harvey Jackins&#x27; Re-evaluation Counselling and the work of Carl Rogers, including his student Eugene Gendlin; (see Focusing) as well as on the development of the Humanistic Psychodrama by Hans-Werner Gessmann since the 80s.

===Ideal and real selves===
The ideal self and real self involve understanding the issues that arise from having an idea of what you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.

===Non-pathological===
Humanistic psychology tends to look beyond the medical model of psychology in order to open up a non-pathologizing view of the person. This usually implies that the therapist downplays the pathological aspects of a person&#x27;s life in favour of the healthy aspects. Humanistic psychology tries to be a science of human experience, focusing on the actual lived experience of persons. Therefore, a key ingredient is the actual meeting of therapist and client and the possibilities for dialogue to ensue between them. The role of the therapist is to create an environment where the client can freely express any thoughts or feelings; he does not suggest topics for conversation nor does he guide the conversation in any way. The therapist also does not analyze or interpret the client&#x27;s behavior or any information the client shares. The role of the therapist is to provide empathy and to listen attentively to the client.

==Societal applications==

===Social change===

While personal transformation may be the primary focus of most humanistic psychologists, many also investigate pressing social, cultural, and gender issues. In an academic anthology from 2018, British psychologist Richard House and his co-editors wrote, &quot;From its very outset, Humanistic Psychology has engaged fulsomely and fearlessly with the social, cultural and political, in a way that much of mainstream scientific, &#x27;positivistic&#x27; psychology has sought to avoid&quot;.
Some of the earliest writers who were associated with and inspired by psychological humanism explored socio-political topics. For example:
* Alfred Adler argued that achieving a sense of community feeling is essential to human development.
* Medard Boss defined health as an openness to the world, and unhealth as anything in the psyche or society that blocked or constricted that openness.
* Erich Fromm argued that the totalitarian impulse is rooted in people&#x27;s fear of the uncertainties and responsibilities of freedom – and that the way to overcome that fear is to dare to live life fully and compassionately.
* R. D. Laing analyzed the political nature of &quot;normal&quot;, everyday experience.
* Rollo May said that people have lost their values in the modern world, and that their health and humanity depends on having the courage to forge new values appropriate to the challenges of the present.
* Wilhelm Reich argued that psychological problems are often caused by sexual repression, and that the latter is influenced by social and political conditions – which can and should be changed.
* Carl Rogers came to believe that political life did not have to consist of an endless series of winner-take-all battles, that it could and should consist of an ongoing dialogue among all parties. If such dialogue were characterized by respect among the parties and authentic speaking by each party, compassionate understanding and – ultimately – mutually acceptable solutions could be reached.
* Virginia Satir was convinced that her approach to family therapy would enable individuals to expand their consciousness, become less fearful, and bring communities, cultures, and nations together.

Relevant work was not confined to these pioneer thinkers. In 1978, members of the Association for Humanistic Psychology (AHP) embarked on a three-year effort to explore how the principles of humanistic psychology could be used to further the process of positive social and political change. The effort included a &quot;12-Hour Political Party&quot;, held in San Francisco in 1980, where nearly 1,400 attendees discussed presentations by such non-traditional social thinkers as &quot;Ecotopia&quot; author Ernest Callenbach, &quot;Aquarian Conspiracy&quot; author Marilyn Ferguson, &quot;Person/Planet&quot; author Theodore Roszak, and &quot;New Age Politics&quot; author Mark Satin. The emergent perspective was summarized in a manifesto by AHP President George Leonard. It proffered such ideas as moving to a slow-growth or no-growth economy, decentralizing and &quot;deprofessionalizing&quot; society, and teaching social and emotional competencies in order to provide a foundation for more humane public policies and a healthier culture.

There have been many other attempts to articulate humanistic-psychology-oriented approaches to social change. For example, in 1979 psychologist Kenneth Lux and economist Mark A. Lutz called for a new economics based on humanistic psychology rather than utilitarianism. Also in 1979, California state legislator John Vasconcellos published a book calling for the integration of liberal politics and humanistic-psychological insight. From 1979 to 1983 the New World Alliance, a U.S. political organization based in Washington, D.C., attempted to inject humanistic-psychology ideas into political thinking and processes; sponsors of its newsletter included Vasconcellos and Carl Rogers.

In 1989 Maureen O&#x27;Hara, who had worked with both Carl Rogers and Paulo Freire, pointed to a convergence between the two thinkers. According to O&#x27;Hara, both focus on developing critical consciousness of situations which oppress and dehumanize. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Institute of Noetic Sciences president Willis Harman argued that significant social change cannot occur without significant consciousness change. In the 21st century, influenced by humanistic psychology, people such as Edmund Bourne, Joanna Macy, and Marshall Rosenberg continued to apply psychological insights to social and political issues.

In addition to its uses in thinking about social change, humanistic psychology is considered to be the main theoretical and methodological source of humanistic social work.

===Social work===
After psychotherapy, social work is the most important beneficiary of the humanistic psychology&#x27;s theory and methodology. These theories have produced a deep reform of the modern social work practice and theory, leading, among others, to the occurrence of a particular theory and methodology: Humanistic Social Work. Most values and principles of the humanistic social work practice, described by Malcolm Payne in his book &quot;Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice&quot;, directly originate from the humanistic psychological theory and humanistic psychotherapy practice, namely creativity in human life and practice, developing self and spirituality, developing security and resilience, accountability, flexibility and complexity in human life and practice.

Furthermore, the representation and approach of the client (as &quot;human&quot; being) and social issue (as &quot;human&quot; issue) in social work is made from the humanistic psychology position. According to Petru Stefaroi, the way humanistic representation and approach of the client and their personality is realized is, in fact, the theoretical-axiological and methodological foundation of humanistic social work.

In setting goals and the intervention activities, in order to solve social/human problems, there prevail critical terms and categories of the humanistic psychology and psychotherapy, such as: self-actualization, human potential, holistic approach, human being, free will, subjectivity, human experience, self-determination/development, spirituality, creativity, positive thinking, client-centered and context-centered approach/intervention, empathy, personal growth, empowerment. Humanistic psychology has been utilised as a framework for theorizing the African philosophy of Ubuntu in social work practice. In addition, humanistic social work calls for the pursuit of social justice, holistic service provision, technological innovation and stewardship, dialogue and cooperation as well as professional care and peer support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Creativity in corporations===

Humanistic psychology&#x27;s emphasis on creativity and wholeness created a foundation for new approaches towards human capital in the workplace stressing creativity and the relevance of emotional interactions. Previously the connotations of &quot;creativity&quot; were reserved for and primarily restricted to, working artists. In the 1980s, with increasing numbers of people working in the cognitive-cultural economy, creativity came to be seen as a useful commodity and competitive edge for international brands. This led to corporate creativity training in-service trainings for employees, led pre-eminently by Ned Herrmann at G.E. in the late 1970s.

<doc id="324183" wikidata="Q639711" url="?curid=324183" title="Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter">
<text>The Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) was a proposed NASA spacecraft designed to explore the icy moons of Jupiter. The main target was Europa, where an ocean of liquid water may harbor alien life. Ganymede and Callisto, which are now thought to also have liquid, salty oceans beneath their icy surfaces, were also targets of interest for the probe.

== The JIMO spacecraft ==

Throughout JIMO&#x27;s main voyage to the Jupiter moons, it was to be propelled by an ion propulsion system via either the High Power Electric Propulsion or NEXIS engine, and powered by a small fission reactor.
A Brayton power conversion system would convert reactor heat into electricity. Providing a thousand times the electrical output of conventional solar- or radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)-based power systems, the reactor was expected to open up opportunities like flying a full scale ice-penetrating radar system and providing a strong, high-bandwidth data transmitter.

Using electric propulsion (8 ion engines, plus Hall thrusters of varying sizes) would make it possible to go into and leave orbits around the moons of Jupiter, creating more thorough observation and mapping windows than exist for current spacecraft, which must make short fly-by maneuvers because of limited fuel for maneuvering.

The design called for the reactor to be positioned in the tip of the spacecraft behind a strong radiation shield protecting sensitive spacecraft equipment. The reactor would only be powered up once the probe was well out of Earth orbit, so that the amount of radionuclides that would be launched into orbit is minimized. This configuration is thought to be less risky than the RTGs used on previous missions to the outer Solar System.

The &quot;Europa Lander Mission&quot; proposed to include a small nuclear-powered Europa lander on JIMO. It would travel with the orbiter, which would also function as a communication relay to Earth. It would investigate Europa&#x27;s habitability and assess its astrobiological potential by confirming the existence of water within and below Europa&#x27;s icy shell, and determining its characteristics.

Northrop Grumman was selected on September 20, 2004 for a US$400 million preliminary design contract, beating Lockheed Martin and Boeing IDS. The contract was to have run through to 2008. Separate contracts, covering construction and individual instruments, were to be awarded at a later date.

== Preliminary design specifications ==
* Gross mass in low Earth orbit: 36,375 kg
* Mass of xenon propellant: 12,000 kg
* Reactor module mass: 6,182 kg (200 kWe output)
* Spacecraft module dry mass: 16,193 kg 
* Science payload mass: 1,500 kg
* Electric turboalternators: multiple 104 kW (440 V AC)
* Deployable radiator: 422 m2 surface area
* Electric Herakles ion thrusters: multiple 30 kW high efficiency, specific impulse 7,000 s (69 kN·s/kg)
* Hall thrusters: high power, higher thrust
* Telecommunications link: 10 Mbit/s (4×250 watt TWTA)
* Deployed size: 58.4 m long × 15.7 m wide
* Stowed size: 19.7 m long × 4.57 m wide
* Mission design life: 20 years
* Launch date: 2017
* Launch Vehicle: Delta IV Heavy
* Cost: 16 billion $ excluding launch 

==Nuclear propulsion==
The JIMO mission was proposed to include a nuclear electric propulsion system, with power provided by a small 200 kWe fission power system. The nuclear propulsion program was conducted from 2003 to 2005 by the Naval Reactors branch of the DOE.

The proposed system design was a gas-cooled reactor and Brayton power conversion to generate a peak output of 200 kilowatts of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa/doe2010&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission profile ==

Three launches were planned for May 2015 to low Earth orbit in order to assemble the two transfer stages and the probe. Transfer stages were designed to launch the probe on its trajectory to Jupiter during the launch window extending from late October 2015 to mid-January 2016.

During the first month of flight, the probe&#x27;s main structures would be deployed, the nuclear reactor activated, and the thrusters tested. The interplanetary flight would have lasted until April 2021 (the ion engines were supposed to work two-thirds of the time).

Once the probe was in the influence area of Jupiter, the navigation would become more complex and difficult. The probe would have to use gravity assist manoeuvres to enter orbit.

The probe would have studied Callisto and then Ganymede for three months each, and finally Europa for one month (studies of Io were also planned when orbital conditions would have been favorable).

At the end of the mission in September 2025, the vehicle would have been parked in a stable orbit around Europa.

== Cancellation ==
Due to a shift in priorities at NASA that favored crewed space missions, the project lost funding in 2005, effectively cancelling the JIMO mission. Among other issues, the proposed nuclear technology was deemed too ambitious, as was the multiple-launch and in-orbit assembly mission architecture.
Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with JIMO were laid off or reassigned during the spring and summer of 2005.

As a result of the budget changes, NASA is instead considering a demonstration mission to a target closer to Earth to test out the reactor and heat rejection systems. The spacecraft would possibly be scaled down from its original size as well.

When it was cancelled, the JIMO mission was in an early planning stage and launch wasn&#x27;t expected before 2017. It was to be the first proposed mission of NASA&#x27;s Project Prometheus, a program for developing nuclear fission into a means of spacecraft propulsion.

===Subsequent proposed replacements===
After JIMO, NASA and ESA planned a joint mission to Jupiter&#x27;s moons, the Europa Jupiter System Mission. This mission was also cancelled in 2011.

ESA has since continued to work separately on that design and on May 2, 2012 selected the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) mission over two other ESA missions for funding. The JUICE mission will study the Jupiter moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede and was launched as an ESA L-class mission on April 14, 2023 on an Ariane 5 carrier rocket.

In the late 2010s, the Europa Clipper became the main NASA mission to Europa with a significant difference in that it would be solar-powered and engage in multiple flybys of the moon rather than orbit it. Another similar mission is the Europa Lander, a proposed NASA astrobiology mission to Europa, to complement Europa Clipper. Europa Clipper was launched in 2024 and Europa Lander is planned to be launched in 2027.

<doc id="324196" wikidata="Q26036" url="?curid=324196" title="Fred Lynn">
<text>Fredric Michael Lynn (born February 3, 1952) is an American former professional baseball center fielder who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), mostly with the Boston Red Sox and the California Angels. He was the first player to win MLB&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award and Most Valuable Player Award in the same year, which he accomplished in 1975 with the Red Sox.

Lynn was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002 and to the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Early life==
Lynn was born in Chicago, and graduated from El Monte High School located in Los Angeles County in 1969. He was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 3rd round in the 1970 amateur draft but he chose to attend the University of Southern California, where he was a member of the USC Trojans baseball teams that won the College World Series in 1971, 1972, and 1973. He represented the United States at the 1971 Pan American Games, where he won a silver medal. He was selected by the Red Sox in the second round of the 1973 MLB draft, with the 41st overall pick. Lynn played in Boston&#x27;s minor league system during 1973 (with the Double-A Bristol Red Sox) and during 1974 (with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox).

==Professional career==
===Boston Red Sox (1974–1980)===
Lynn made his major league debut on September 5, 1974, in a Boston loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. He appeared in 15 games through the end of the season, batting 18-for-43 (.419).

Lynn had an outstanding 1975 season; in 145 games with the Red Sox, he batted .331 with 21 home runs and 105 RBIs. He led the American League (AL) in doubles, runs scored, and slugging percentage, finished second in batting (Rod Carew of the Minnesota Twins hit .359), and won a Gold Glove Award for his defensive play. Lynn won both the Most Valuable Player Award and Rookie of the Year Award, becoming the first player to win both in the same season; the feat was later duplicated by Seattle Mariners right fielder Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. In a game on June 18 at Tiger Stadium, Lynn hit three home runs, had 10 RBIs, and 16 total bases in one game. Lynn and fellow rookie outfielder Jim Rice were dubbed the &quot;Gold Dust Twins&quot;. In the 1975 World Series, which Boston lost in seven games to the Cincinnati Reds, Lynn batted 7-for-25 (.280) with a home run and five RBIs.

Lynn won three more Gold Gloves (1978, 1979, and 1980), and in 1979 won the AL batting title with a .333 average and finished fourth in MVP voting. He was elected to the All-Star team each season from 1975 through 1980 with Boston. On May 13, 1980, he hit for the cycle.

In seven seasons with the Red Sox, Lynn batted .308 with 124 home runs and 521 RBIs in 828 games played.

===California Angels (1981–1984)===
In January 1981, Lynn and Steve Renko were traded to the Angels for Frank Tanana, Jim Dorsey, and Joe Rudi. Lynn was limited to 76 games in his first year with the Angels, 1981, due to a knee injury. For the season, he batted just .219 with five home runs and 31 RBIs. He played three more seasons with the Angels, batting .299 in 138 games during 1982, .272 in 117 games in 1983, and .271 in 142 games in 1984. His .299 average in 1982 would be the closest he would come to batting .300 again.

In 1982, Lynn and the Angels won the AL West division and made the playoffs, but lost in the 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers in 5 games. Even so, Lynn was selected as MVP of the ALCS, becoming the first player from a losing team to be so honored. Lynn batted an astounding .611 (11 hits in 18 at-bats), with a home run and 5 RBI&#x27;s. Lynn was an All-Star in his first three seasons with the Angels, bringing his total number of selections to nine; he was the MVP of the 1983 All-Star Game, hitting the first grand slam in All-Star Game history. Overall, in his four seasons with the Angels, Lynn appeared in 473 games, batting .271 with 71 home runs and 270 RBIs.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Lynn in their book, &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

===Baltimore Orioles (1985–1988)===
A free agent following the 1984 season, Lynn defied expectations that he would continue his career with a West Coast team by accepting the best offer and signing a five-year $6.8 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles on December 11. His signing, along with that of Lee Lacy and Don Aase, cost the ballclub three of its top five picks in the 1985 MLB Draft and was part of Edward Bennett Williams&#x27; ill-fated attempt to buy championships which only resulted in last-place finishes in 1986 and 1988. Lynn&#x27;s time in Baltimore was most noted for his complaints about the Orioles&#x27; caps which he called &quot;the hat with the funny little duck on it&quot; due to the smiling cartoon bird on the front. Lynn played for the Orioles from the start of the 1985 seasons through August 1988, appearing in a total of 434 games while batting .265 with 87 home runs and 232 RBIs.

===Detroit Tigers (1988–1989)===
On August 31, 1988, the Orioles traded Lynn to the Detroit Tigers for Chris Hoiles, Cesar Mejia, and Robinson Garces. Detroit traded for Lynn for their 1988 pennant drive, and there was some initial controversy about his postseason eligibility. His acquisition was made on the day of the MLB trade deadline, and Lynn did not arrive in Chicago (where the Tigers had played that day) until after the deadline had passed; he was initially declared ineligible for postseason play. MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth later overruled this decision, declaring that as long as the transaction was completed by the deadline, the player did not need to physically &quot;report&quot; to his new team before the deadline. The controversy later proved to be moot, as Detroit finished one game behind Boston in the AL East.

Lynn appeared in 27 games with Detroit through the end of the 1988 season, batting .222 with seven home runs and 19 RBIs. In 1989, he appeared in 117 games, batting .241 with 11 home runs and 46 RBIs. In November 1989, Lynn became a free agent.

===San Diego Padres (1990)===
In December 1989, Lynn signed with the Padres, his first and only National League team. He played 90 games during the 1990 season, batting .240 with six home runs and 23 RBIs at age 38. After the season, he again became a free agent. He was not invited to spring training by any team in 1991, and although he kept in shape in case an opportunity to join a team arose, he did not play in the major leagues again.

===Career statistics===
In his 17-year career, Lynn batted .283 with 1,111 RBIs, 1,960 hits, 1,063 runs, 306 home runs, 388 doubles, 43 triples, and 72 stolen bases in 1969 games. From 1982 to 1988, he had seven consecutive seasons of hitting more than twenty home runs (his totals were 21-22-23-23-23-23-25). His 306 career home runs place him, through the end of the 2017 seasons, in 13th place among center fielders. Defensively, Lynn recorded a career .988 fielding percentage at centerfield, his primary position.

In 15 career postseason games, Lynn batted 22-for-54 (.407) with two home runs and 13 RBIs. Lynn was a nine-time All-Star, batting an overall 6-for-20 (.300) in All-Star Games with four home runs and ten RBIs, including the first (and to date, only) grand slam in All-Star Game history, which he hit in the 1983 game. His four home runs in All-Star Games is second only to Stan Musial with six.

Lynn&#x27;s career was hampered by some injuries caused by fearless play, such as a broken rib from crashing into an outfield wall, or knee injuries from breaking up double plays, and playing all-out defensively. He never played more than 150 games in a season, and only topped 140 games four times.

Lynn played for five different teams, but considers himself a member of the Red Sox family. &quot;I&#x27;m a Red Sock. I didn&#x27;t want to leave the Red Sox,&quot; said Lynn, further noting, &quot;I came up with them and from 1973 to 1980 I was their property. I thought I&#x27;d end up spending my entire career in Boston. It was tough, even though I was going to a great team [the Angels] and playing for a great owner in Gene Autry.&quot;

==Post-playing career==

Lynn worked as a baseball color analyst for ESPN from 1991 to 1998, doing some College World Series games and some west coast MLB games. He has also been a spokesman for Gillette and MasterCard, and occasionally entertains clients at Red Sox games from the Legends Skybox at Fenway Park.

Lynn has raised thousands of dollars through charity work for Childhaven, a home for abused and neglected children, and FACE Foundation, an animal charity. He has been a frequent participant in the All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game, held annually since 2001 in the days leading up to the MLB All-Star Game.

Lynn was inducted into the USC Hall of Fame in 1994, and was selected by fans to the Red Sox&#x27; All-Fenway Team in 2012.

==Personal life==
While in high school, Lynn met a fellow student named Diane May Minkle, a cheerleader who went by the name &quot;Dee Dee&quot;. The two married in February 1974, and went on to have two children, son Jason and daughter Jennifer. Fred and Dee Dee later divorced. Lynn has three grandchildren through his first marriage.

In 1986, Lynn married second wife Natalie Cole. As of 2014, Lynn resided in Carlsbad, California, with his wife.

<text>Lior Narkis (; born November 8, 1976, in Holon, Israel) is an Israeli singer.

==Biography==
Lior Narkis was born in Holon. His father, David Narkis, was of Iraqi-Jewish origin. His mother Hanna Narkis, was of Serbian-Jewish descent and also had Greek-Tunisian-Jewish ancestry. Narkis speaks Hebrew, Serbian and French. He is married to Sapir Vanunu, who is thirteen years his junior. They have two sons and a daughter, and live in Savyon.

His sixth album, &quot;Rak Itakh&quot; (Only with You), which includes the hit &quot;Lekhol Ekhad Yesh&quot; (Everyone Has), placed Narkis at the center stage of Israeli music. This song was also chosen as the &quot;Song of the Year&quot; in Israel, and was very popular among football (soccer) fans. In 2001, Narkis released his album &quot;Ze Mehalev&quot; (&quot;Straight from the Heart&quot;). As with his previous albums, this was a great success and many of its songs became hits.

<text>Greenwood Raceway (originally Woodbine Race Course) was a horse racing facility in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
===Woodbine Race Course===
Inaugurated in 1874 as Woodbine Race Course at the foot of Woodbine Avenue and Lake Ontario, it was owned and operated by Raymond Pardee and William J. &quot;Jiggs&quot; Howell. The facility&#x27;s land was mostly owned by Jesse Ashbridge and C.C. Small. Within a few years, financial problems resulted in the property reverting to Joseph Duggan, the original landowner and retired innkeeper. In 1881, Duggan helped found the Ontario Jockey Club (OJC). The facility hosted seasonal harness racing for Standardbred horses and flat racing events for Thoroughbreds.

Harness racing dates were transferred to the racetrack from Thorncliffe Park Raceway to fill the gap between the spring and fall thoroughbred meets, and the track was known as Greenwood Raceway during the harness meets. The track was at the junction of Kingston Road and Queen Street East, with only a narrow strip of land between it and Lake Ontario. Thoroughbred racing continued at the racetrack on a shortened six-furlong (1,207 m) track. Harness races were at first conducted on the Thoroughbred track, but serious problems with mud (including the starting gate being immobilized) led to the construction of a five-furlong (1006 m) stone dust harness track inside the Thoroughbred track. This track was known for its tight turns and long back and homestretches.

In the early 1950s, the Ontario Jockey Club, led by directors E. P. Taylor, George C. Hendrie, and J. E. Frowde Seagram, undertook an acquisition and consolidation program for southern Ontario racing. The OJC bought and closed the Orpen-owned Dufferin Park and Long Branch race tracks. By 1956, the OJC operated just three facilities, consisting of the Fort Erie Racetrack in Fort Erie, Ontario, and two facilities in Toronto. A new facility for Thoroughbred horse races was constructed in Etobicoke and given the name Woodbine Racetrack.

===Greenwood Raceway===
The old facility was completely renovated and renamed Greenwood Raceway in 1963. It held both harness racing and Thoroughbred racing meets until its closure at the end of 1993. Steeplechase races were held at Woodbine/Greenwood for a few years, and there was a Thoroughbred race announcer by the name of Foster &quot;Buck&quot; Dryden for several years.

A horse by the name of Last Mark (owned by James G. Fair of Cainsville, Ontario) won the &quot;Plate&quot; in 1948, setting a new Plate record and only being equalled once before the track was decommissioned. R.J. Speers&#x27; horse, Lord Fairmond, came second in that Plate race. Fair had two horses in that Plate which never ran in the Plate Trials but worked out between the two divisions of the Trials. Their times were faster than the times of either of the trial divisions.

Greenwood Raceway was the site of the Canadian Pacing Derby, the North America Cup, the Fan Hanover Stakes, the Maple Leaf Trot, and the Canadian Trotting Classic.
In 1994, the Thoroughbred and harness operations were moved to Woodbine Racetrack in Etobicoke. The stadium was demolished and replaced by residential and commercial development, including a betting parlour. To commemorate the history of the site, two of the new residential roadways were given names that reflected horse racing themes: Northern Dancer Blvd. (in honour of the famous thoroughbred Northern Dancer) and Winners Circle. Joseph Duggan Road was named after the historical landowner.

===Woodbine Park===

The southern half of the property became Woodbine Park with a water fountain feature in a man-made pond. It is separated from Woodbine Beach by Lake Shore Boulevard.

===Greenwood Off Track Wagering===
In 2016, it was announced that Live Nation Entertainment had purchased the other half of the property (known as Greenwood Off Track Wagering or Champions Greenwood) with the intent of repurposing the site into a medium-sized entertainment venue with a capacity of 2,700 attendees.

<doc id="324210" wikidata="Q1585838" url="?curid=324210" title="Jemini">
<text>Jemini (formerly Tricity) are a British pop group from Liverpool, best known for scoring &quot;nul points&quot; and finishing in last place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with &quot;Cry Baby&quot;.

==Early career==
Chris Cromby and Gemma Abbey (born 10 March 1981) met in 1995 at Liverpool&#x27;s Starlight Stage School and toured Liverpool&#x27;s pubs and clubs with the academy&#x27;s kids&#x27; roadshow. At 16, after leaving college, they formed Tricity, named after the brand of electrical appliances. They changed their name to Jemini (&quot;Gem-and-I&quot;) at the age of 19. They spent the next two and a half years touring pubs and clubs in the UK performing Stevie Wonder, Randy Crawford and Motown covers and ABBA medleys, as well as their own compositions. Abbey stated she has loved the Eurovision Song Contest since childhood, and counts previous Eurovision entrants such as Sonia, Precious and Dana International amongst her favourites.

==&quot;Cry Baby&quot;==

Jemini and the song &quot;Cry Baby&quot; were selected to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 in Riga, Latvia, after winning the BBC&#x27;s national selection &quot;&quot;. Their performance at Eurovision was criticised for being off-key, and later earned the UK &quot;nul points&quot;.

=== Failure and break-up ===
The Eurovision failure prompted both mirth and consternation in the British media. Jemini admitted that their performance was off-key, and claimed they were unable to hear the backing track due to a technical fault. Terry Wogan, long-time commentator on the contest for the BBC, claimed that the UK was suffering from &quot;post-Iraq backlash&quot;. Following their failure at Eurovision, they were dropped by their record label, Integral Records UK, and their planned album was never released. &quot;Cry Baby&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 15, but spent only three weeks in the chart. They later split up as a duo.

=== Reunions ===
In 2013, the duo reunited for a special interview about their performance in a two-hour-long BBC Three special &quot;How to Win Eurovision&quot;. The special aired on 11 May 2013. In 2014, the duo reunited once again to take part in a Eurovision special of &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;, and have subsequently appeared in several television interviews about their Eurovision experience.

==Legal issues==
Abbey was arrested and sentenced for social security fraud in November 2016. She was claiming as a single mother when she had undergone a wedding ceremony in Algarve in 2013 and was living with her partner. She overclaimed tax credits for her daughter born in 2009. She was given a 30-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, and put on supervision order for one year.

<text>Oleksandr Valeriyovych Ponomariov (; born August 9, 1973) is a Ukrainian singer. He has been awarded the country&#x27;s &quot;Singer of the Year&quot; seven times.

==Early life and education==
Ponomariov was born in Khmelnitskiy, Ukrainian SSR (now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine). One of his early interests was boxing. When his eyesight started to deteriorate he was forbidden to fight by his doctor. While he had always enjoyed singing, he never thought that music could be his main occupation. Despite this, he applied to a music college where he encountered one drawback: he could not read music. The college professors accepted him on the basis of his excellent singing voice and allowed him to stay on the condition that he master the school&#x27;s seven-year curriculum in the space of one year. He apparently succeeded.

==Career==
Since 1992, Oleksandr has taken part in dozens of Ukrainian and international festivals. In 1998, Ukraine&#x27;s government recognized Oleksandr by awarding him the title of &quot;Honored Artist of Ukraine&quot;.

Oleksandr, performing &quot;Hasta la vista&quot; was the first artist ever to represent Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. His performance included a circus act with a contortionist and an Apollo program rocket. He finished in 14th place.

<doc id="324217" wikidata="Q28456" url="?curid=324217" title="Silla">
<text>Silla (; Old Korean: , Yale: Syerapel, RR: &quot;Seorabeol&quot;; IPA: ) was a Korean kingdom that existed between 57 BCE – 935 CE and was located on the southern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula. Silla, along with Baekje and Goguryeo, formed the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Silla had the lowest population of the three, approximately 850,000 people (170,000 households), significantly smaller than those of Baekje (3,800,000 people) and Goguryeo (3,500,000 people).

Its foundation can be traced back to the semi-mythological figure of Hyeokgeose of Silla (Old Korean: *pulkunae, &quot;light of the world&quot;), of the Park clan. The country was first ruled intermittently by the Miryang Park clan for 232 years and the Wolseong Seok clan for 172 years and beginning with the reign of Michu Isageum the Gyeongju Kim clan for 586 years. Park, Seok and Kim have no contemporary attestations and went by the Old Korean names of 居西干 &quot;Geoseogan&quot; (1st century BCE), 次次雄 &quot;Chachaung&quot; (1st century CE), 泥師今 &quot;Isageum&quot; (Old Korean: *nisokum) and 麻立干 &quot;Maripkan&quot; (5th-6th century) instead.

It began as a chiefdom in the Jinhan confederacy, part of the Samhan, and after consolidating its power in the immediate area, conquered the Gaya confederacy. Eventually allying with Sui China and then Tang China, it conquered the other two kingdoms, Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in 668. Thereafter, Unified Silla occupied most of the Korean Peninsula, while the northern part re-emerged as Balhae, a successor-state of Goguryeo. After nearly 1,000 years of rule, Silla fragmented into the brief Later Three Kingdoms of Silla, Later Baekje, and Taebong, handing over power to Goryeo in 935.

== Etymology ==
Until the official adoption of Hanja names for its administration, Silla was recorded using the Hundok reading of Hanja to phonetically approximate its native Korean name, including (), (), (), (), (), and ().

In 504, Jijeung of Silla standardized the characters into (), which in Modern Korean is pronounced &quot;Silla&quot;. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, the name of (&quot;Silla&quot;), consisting of the components &quot;sin&quot; (), as in &quot;deokeopilsin&quot; () and &quot;ra&quot;, as in &quot;mangrasabang &quot; () is thought to be a later Confucian interpretation.

The modern Seoul is a shortened form of Seorabeol, meaning &quot;capital city&quot;, and was continuously used throughout the Goryeo and Joseon periods even in official documents, despite the formal name having been Hanyang or Hanseong. The name of the Silla capital changed into its Late Middle Korean form &quot;Syeobeul&quot; (), meaning &quot;royal capital city,&quot; which changed to &quot;Syeoul&quot; () soon after, and finally resulted in &quot;Seoul&quot; () in the Modern Korean language.

The name of either Silla or its capital Seorabeol was widely used throughout Northeast Asia as the ethnonym for the people of Silla, appearing as in Japanese and as &quot;Solgo&quot; or &quot;Solho&quot; in the language of the medieval Jurchens and their later descendants, the Manchus, respectively. Koreans are still known as &quot;Солонгос&quot; (&quot;Solongos&quot;) in Mongolian, which is according to popular folk etymology is believed to be derived from the Mongolian word for &quot;rainbow&quot; (&quot;солонго&quot; &quot;solongo&quot;). In a paper published in 2023 regarding the etymology of the Mongolian word &quot;Solongos&quot; &quot;Korea, Koreans,&quot; the following seven etymological hypotheses regarding the origin of &quot;Solongos&quot; have been enumerated: (1) It comes from the Mongolian word &quot;solongo&quot; meaning &quot;rainbow&quot;; (2) It comes from the Mongolian word &quot;solongo&quot; meaning &quot;weasel&quot;; (3) It comes from the Mongolian/Manchurian ethnonym Solon; (4) It comes from the name of the ancient kingdom of Silla; (5) It comes from Jurchen *&quot;Solgo(r)&quot; ~ &quot;Solho&quot; which in turn stems from Old Korean 수릿골 &quot;suɾiskol&quot; &gt; 솔골 &quot;solkol&quot; &quot;Goguryeo&quot;; (later) Korea, Korean&quot;; (6) It comes from the Mongolian word &quot;solgoi&quot; &quot;left, east&quot;; (7) It comes from the name of the medieval kingdom of Goryeo (via *&quot;Hoɾyo&quot; &gt; *&quot;Solo(n)-&quot;). The authors of this paper have ended up supporting the sixth hypothesis, &quot;i.e.&quot; that Mongolian &quot;Solongos&quot; &quot;Korea, Koreans&quot; ultimately should be cognate with Mongolian &quot;soluγai&quot; &gt; &quot;solγoi&quot; &quot;left, wrong side of the body, left-handed, enemy to the east (from the perspective of the Mongols)&quot;.&quot;

Silla was also referred to as Gyerim (), literally &quot;rooster forest&quot;, a name that has its origins in the forest near the Silla capital. Legend has it that the state&#x27;s founder was born in the same forest, hatched from the egg of a cockatrice ().

== History ==
=== Founding ===
During the Proto–Three Kingdoms period, central and southern Korea consisted of three confederacies called the Samhan. Silla began as &quot;Saro-guk&quot;, a statelet within the 12-member confederacy known as Jinhan. Saro-guk consisted of six clans later known as the Six Clans of Jinhan () from Gojoseon.

According to Korean records, Silla was founded by Bak Hyeokgeose of Silla in 57 BCE, around present-day Gyeongju. Hyeokgeose is said to have been hatched from an egg laid from a white horse, and when he turned 13, six clans submitted to him as king and established the kingdom of &quot;Saro (pronounced [si.raʔ] at the time)&quot; which later became the kingdom of Silla.

In various inscriptions on archaeological founding such as personal gravestones and monuments, it is recorded that Silla royals considered themselves having Xiongnu ancestry through the Xiongnu prince Kim Il-je, also known as Jin Midi in Chinese sources. According to several historians, it is possible that this unknown tribe was originally of Koreanic origin in the Korean peninsula and joined the Xiongnu confederation. Later the tribe&#x27;s ruling family returned to Korea from Liaodong peninsula where they thrive, and after coming back to the peninsula they got married into the royal family of Silla. There are also some Korean researchers that point out that the grave goods of Silla and of the eastern Xiongnu are alike, and some researchers insist that the Silla king is descended from Xiongnu. It&#x27;s more likely that the ruling families were just native Koreanic speakers as the linguistic situation at that time suggests.

Nihon Shoki and Kojiki also mentions Silla as the place where the Japanese god, Susanoo first descended from the heavens after his banishment in a place called &quot;Soshimori&quot; (). Up until the liberation of Korea in 1945, Meiji era Japanese historians claimed that Susanoo had ruled over Silla and that the Koreans were the descendants of him, thus finding justification and legitimizing the Japanese occupation of Korea through the use of Nissen dōsoron. According to the &quot;Shinsen Shōjiroku&quot;, Inahi no Mikoto the brother of the mythological Emperor Jimmu was the ancestor to the kings of Silla. Another source found in &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; claims that a Japanese man named, Hogong helped build the kingdom of Silla.

=== Early period ===
In its early days, Silla started off as a city-state by the name of Saro (), initially founded by Yemaek refugees from Gojoseon. It has also accepted dispersed people fleeing from the Lelang Commandery after Goguryeo&#x27;s invasion, while later on incorporating native Jin people in the vicinity and Ye people to the North.

Talhae of Silla (57 CE–80 CE) was the son-in-law of Namhae of Silla (4 CE–24 CE). According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Seoktalhae was the prince of &quot;Yongseongguk&quot; (龍成國) or &quot;Dapana&quot; (多婆那國), located 1,000-ri (里), northeast of Japan (?). Following the will of Namhae of Silla, he became the fourth king of Silla. One day, he found a low peak next to Mt. Toham (吐含山) and packed it with his own house, and he buried charcoal next to the house of a Japonic official named Hogong (瓠公), who lived there, and deceived him that his ancestors were blacksmiths, but the Hogong family took their home. Hogong was tricked into handing over his house and property to the Seoktalhae. During this period, Kim Al-chi, the ancestor of Gyeongju Kim, was adopted by Talhae of Silla.

The territory outside the capital was greatly conquered during the period of Pasa of Silla (80–112). As soon as he ascended the throne, he ordered officials to encourage agriculture, silkworm farming and train soldiers. There was a territorial dispute between the Eumjipbeol and Siljikgok, and the two countries first asked Pasa of Silla to mediate, Pasa of Silla was handed over to King Suro of Gimhae, who was the local leader at the time. King Suro instead resolved the territorial issue and ruled in favor of Eumjipbeol. However, King Suro sent an assassin to kill the head of the six Silla divisions, who hid in the Eumjipbeol while the assassin was escaping, and King Tachugan (陀鄒干) protected the assassin. In response, Pasa of Silla invaded Eumjipbeol in 102 and Tachugan surrendered, and the Siljikgok and Apdok, which were frightened by Silla, also surrendered. Six years later, it entered the inland area and attacked and merged Dabulguk, Bijigukuk, and Chopalguk.

During the Naehae of Silla period (196–230), the Eight Port Kingdoms War (浦上八國 亂) broke out to determine hegemony in the southern part of the peninsula. In 209, when the &quot;eight upper countries (of the estuary)&quot; (浦上八國) in the Nakdong River basin attacked the Silla-friendly Aragaya, the prince of Aragaya asked Silla for a rescue army, and the king ordered Crown Prince Seok Uro to gather his troops and attack the eight kingdoms. Crown Prince SeokUro saved Aragaya and rescued 6,000 of the pro-Silla Gaya people who had been captured and returned to their homeland. Three years later, three among the eight countries (浦上八國), Golpo-guk, Chilpo-guk, and Gosapo-guk, will launch counterattacks against Silla. A battle took place in Yeomhae, the southeastern part of the capital, and the war ended when the Silla king came out to fight against it, and the soldiers of the three kingdoms were defeated.
By the 2nd century, Silla existed as its own distinct political entity in the southeastern area of the Korean peninsula. It expanded its influence over the neighboring Jinhan chiefdoms, but throughout the 3rd century was probably no more than the strongest constituent in the Jinhan confederacy.

To the west, Baekje had centralized into a kingdom by about 250 CE, overtaking the Mahan confederacy. To the southwest, Byeonhan was being replaced by the Gaya confederacy. In northern Korea, Goguryeo, founded around 50 CE, destroyed the last Chinese commandery in 313 CE and had grown into the largest regional power.

=== Emergence of a centralized monarchy ===
Naemul of Silla (356–402) of the Kim clan established a hereditary monarchy and took the royal title of &quot;Maripgan&quot; (麻立干; 마립간). However, in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Naemul of Silla still appears as a title of &quot;Isageum&quot; (泥師今; 이사금). He is considered by many historians as the starting point of the Gyeongju Kim period, which lasted more than 550 years. However, even when the Kim monopolized the throne for more than 500 years, the veneration of the founder Bak Hyeokgeose continued.

In 377, Silla sent emissaries to China and established relations with Goguryeo. Facing pressure from Baekje in the west and Japan in the south, in the later part of the 4th century, Silla allied with Goguryeo. However, after King Gwanggaeto&#x27;s unification campaign, Silla lost its status as a sovereign country becoming a vassal of Goguryeo. When Goguryeo began to expand its territory southward, moving its capital to Pyongyang in 427, Nulji of Silla was forced to ally with Baekje.

By the time of Beopheung of Silla (514–540), Silla was a full-fledged kingdom, with Buddhism as state religion, and its own Korean era name. Silla absorbed the Gaya confederacy during the Gaya–Silla Wars, annexing Geumgwan Gaya in 532 and conquering Daegaya in 562, thereby expanding its borders to the Nakdong River basin.

Jinheung of Silla (540–576) established a strong military force. Silla helped Baekje drive Goguryeo out of the Han River (Seoul) area, and then wrested control of the entire central western Korea region from Baekje in 553, breaching the 120-year Baekje-Silla alliance. Also, King Jinheung established the Hwarang.

The early period ended with the death of Jindeok of Silla and the demise of the &quot;hallowed bone&quot; (; &quot;seonggol&quot;) rank system.

==== Etymology of title ====
The royal title &quot;Maripgan&quot; () is analyzed into two elements in many popular explanations, with the first element alleged to be from the Korean root
* &quot;mari&quot; (마리) from Middle Korean 마리〮 &quot;màlí&quot;, &quot;head&quot;/ countable of &quot;head / per head&quot; or &quot;hair&quot;
* &quot;mang-rip&quot; or &quot;mang-nip&quot; (網笠), &quot;a traditional-style hat made of horsehair&quot;
* &quot;mo-rip&quot; (毛笠), &quot;a kind of hat worn by servants in the old days&quot;
* &quot;mi-rip&quot; or &quot;mi-reup&quot;, meaning &quot;a knack, a trick, the hang of something&quot;
* &quot;madi&quot; (맏이) or &quot;maji&quot; (맏히), meaning &quot;the firstborn, the eldest (child of a family); an elder, a senior, a person whose age is greater than someone else&#x27;s age&quot;
* &quot;mat-jip&quot; (맛집), meaning &quot;the house in which the head of a household lives, the main house on an estate&quot;
* &quot;mŏrŏ&quot; or &quot;maru&quot; (마루), meaning &quot;ridge, peak, crest (of a roof, a mountain, a wave, &quot;etc.&quot;); zenith, climax, prime; the first, the standard&quot;
* &quot;maru&quot; (마루) or &quot;mallu&quot;, meaning &quot;floor&quot;
or from a word related to Middle Korean &quot;marh&quot; meaning &quot;stake, post, pile, picket, peg, pin (of a tent)&quot;.

The second element, &quot;gan&quot; (Hangul: 간), is a likely cognate to &quot;han&quot; (Hangul: 한) and the word for &quot;big, great&quot; &quot;keun,&quot; first attested as Late Old Korean 黑根 *hùkú-n. Both carry the meaning of &quot;great, leader&quot;, which was previously used by the princes of southern Korea, and is sometimes also speculated to have an external relationship with the Mongolic/Turkic title of Khan.

=== Unified Silla ===

In the 7th century, Silla allied itself with the Chinese Tang dynasty. In 660, under Muyeol of Silla (654–661), the Silla–Tang alliance subjugated Baekje after the Baekje–Tang War. In 668, under King Munmu of Silla (King Muyeol&#x27;s successor) and General Kim Yu-sin, the Silla–Tang alliance conquered Goguryeo to its north after the Goguryeo–Tang War. Silla then fought against the Tang dynasty for nearly a decade to expel Chinese forces on the peninsula intent on creating Tang colonies there to finally establish a unified kingdom as far north as modern Pyongyang. The northern region of the defunct Goguryeo state later reemerged as Balhae.

Silla&#x27;s middle period is characterized by the rising power of the monarchy at the expense of the &quot;jingol&quot; nobility. This was made possible by the new wealth and prestige garnered as a result of Silla&#x27;s unification of the peninsula, as well as the monarchy&#x27;s successful suppression of several armed aristocratic revolts following early upon unification, which afforded the king the opportunity of purging the most powerful families and rivals to central authority. Further, for a brief period of about a century from the late 7th to late 8th centuries the monarchy made an attempt to divest aristocratic officialdom of their landed base by instituting a system of salary payments, or office land (&quot;jikjeon&quot;, 직전, 職田), in lieu of the former system whereby aristocratic officials were given grants of land to exploit as salary (the so–called tax villages, or &quot;nog-eup&quot;, 녹읍, 祿邑).

By the late 8th century, however, these royal initiatives had failed to check the power of the entrenched aristocracy. The mid to late 8th century saw renewed revolts led by branches of the Kim clan which effectively limited royal authority. Most prominent of these was a revolt led by Kim Daegong that persisted for three years. One key evidence of the erosion of kingly authority was the rescinding of the office land system and the re-institution of the former tax village system as salary land for aristocratic officialdom in 757.

In Jinjin and Silla, the king was referred to as Gan, and during the Unified Silla Period, the title &quot;Gan&quot; was also used as Chungji Jagan and Agan.

The middle period of Silla came to an end with the assassination of Hyegong of Silla in 780, terminating the kingly line of succession of Muyeol of Silla, the architect of Silla&#x27;s unification of the peninsula. Hyegong&#x27;s demise was a bloody one, the culmination of an extended civil war involving most of the kingdom&#x27;s high–ranking noble families. With Hyegong&#x27;s death, during the remaining years of Silla, the king was reduced to little more than a figurehead as powerful aristocratic families became increasingly independent of central control.

Thereafter the Silla kingship was fixed in the house of Wonseong of Silla (785–798), though the office itself was continually contested among various branches of the Kim lineage.

Nevertheless, the middle period of Silla witnessed the state at its zenith, the brief consolidation of royal power, and the attempt to institute a Chinese style bureaucratic system.

=== Decline and fall ===
The final century and a half of the Silla state was one of nearly constant upheaval and civil war as the king was reduced to little more than a figurehead and powerful aristocratic families rose to actual dominance outside the capital and royal court.

The tail end of this period, called the Later Three Kingdoms period, briefly saw the emergence of the kingdoms of Later Baekje and Taebong, which were really composed of military forces capitalizing on their respective region&#x27;s historical background, and Silla&#x27;s submission to Goryeo.

== Society and politics ==
From at least the 6th century, when Silla acquired a detailed system of law and governance, social status and official advancement were dictated by the bone rank system. This rigid lineage-based system also dictated clothing, house size, and the permitted range of marriage.

Since its emergence as a centralized polity Silla society had been characterized by its strict aristocratic makeup. Silla had two royal classes: &quot;sacred bone&quot; (&quot;seonggol&quot;, 성골, 聖骨) and &quot;true bone&quot; (&quot;jingol&quot;, 진골, 眞骨). Up until the reign of King Muyeol this aristocracy had been divided into &quot;sacred bone&quot; and &quot;true bone&quot; aristocrats, with the former differentiated by their eligibility to attain the kingship. This duality had ended when Queen Jindeok, the last ruler from the &quot;sacred bone&quot; class, died in 654. The numbers of &quot;sacred bone&quot; aristocrats had been decreasing for generations, as the title was only conferred to those whose parents were both &quot;sacred bones&quot;, whereas children of a &quot;sacred&quot; and a &quot;true bone&quot; parent were considered as &quot;true bones&quot;. There were also many ways for a &quot;sacred bone&quot; to be demoted to a &quot;true bone&quot;, thus making the entire system even more likely to collapse eventually.

The king (or queen) theoretically was an absolute monarch, but royal powers were somewhat constrained by a strong aristocracy. Notably, Silla was unique in having female monarchs. There were, for example, three reigning Sillan female &quot;kings&quot; (yeouang, 여왕), distinct from queens who were merely the consorts of male rulers. Descent also continued to be traced through both paternal and maternal lines throughout the Sillan era, suggesting women enjoyed a relatively high status compared to other contemporary East Asian states.

The &quot;Hwabaek&quot; (화백,和白) served as royal council with decision-making authorities on some vital issues like succession to the throne or declarations of war. The Hwabaek was headed by a person (Sangdaedeung) chosen from the &quot;sacred bone&quot; rank. One of the key decisions of this royal council was the adoption of Buddhism as state religion.

Following unification Silla began to rely more upon Chinese models of bureaucracy to administer its greatly expanded territory. This was a marked change from pre-unification days when the Silla monarchy stressed Buddhism, and the Silla monarch&#x27;s role as a &quot;Buddha-king&quot;. Another salient factor in post-unification politics were the increasing tensions between the Korean monarchy and aristocracy.

== Military ==
The early Silla military was built around a small number of Silla royal guards designed to protect royalty and nobility and in times of war served as the primary military force if needed. Due to the frequency of conflicts between Baekje and Goguryeo as well as Yamato Japan, Silla created six local garrisons one for each district. The royal guards eventually morphed into &quot;sworn banner&quot; or Sodang units. In 625 another group of Sodang was created. Garrison soldiers were responsible for local defense and also served as a police force.

A number of Silla&#x27;s greatest generals and military leaders were Hwarang (equivalent to the Western knights or chevaliers). Originally a social group, due to the continuous military rivalry between the Three Kingdoms of Korea, they eventually transformed from a group of elite male aristocratic youth into soldiers and military leaders. Hwarang were key in the fall of Goguryeo (which resulted in the unification of the Korean Peninsula under Unified Silla) and the Silla–Tang Wars, which expelled Tang forces in the other two Korean kingdoms.

Silla is known to have operated crossbows called the Cheonbono () that was said to have had a range of one thousand steps and a special pike unit called the Jangchang-Dang () to counter enemy cavalry. In particular, Silla&#x27;s crossbows were prized by Tang China due to its excellent functions and durability. Silla would later employ special crossbow units against its Korean counterparts such as Goguryeo and Baekje, as well as the Tang dynasty during the Silla–Tang War. The pike unit, called Changchangdang that would later be known as the Bigeum Legion () as part of the Nine Legions () and which was consisted of Silla folks, had a special purpose to counter the Göktürks cavalries operated by the Tang army during the Silla-Tang War.
In addition, Silla&#x27;s central army, the Nine Legions (), were consisted of Silla, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Mohe people. These nine legions aimed at defending the capital became complete in formation and compilation after Silla unified the Three Kingdoms. Each Legions were known for their representative colors marked on their collars and were constituted by different groups. The Golden, Red, and Dark Blue Legion employed Goguryeoans while the Blue and White Legion accepted Baekje folks into their ranks. The Bigeum (also Red in color), Green, and Purple Legion were formed by Sillan people whilst the Black Legion took dispersed Mohe refugees into their fold that came along with Goguryeo refugees after the Fall of Goguryeo.

Silla is also known for its maritime prowess shown by the navy backed with master shipbuilding and seamanship. The boats employed were usually called &quot;Sillaseon&quot; (), which had an international reputation for its solid durability and effective capabilities that were said to &#x27;enable men surf across the biggest of waves&#x27; amongst the Chinese and Japanese according to the Shoku Nihon Koki. During the Silla-Tang War, the Silla navy under the command of general Sideuk defeated the Tang Navy 22 times out of 23 engagements in Gibeolpo, today&#x27;s Seocheon County. Jang Bogo, a prominent maritime figure of Silla, was also famous for his navy based on the Cheonghaejin Garrison.

== Culture ==

A significant number of Silla tombs can still be found in Gyeongju, the capital of Silla. Silla tombs consist of a stone chamber surrounded by a soil mound. The historic area around Gyeongju was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2000. Much of it is also protected as part of Gyeongju National Park. Additionally, two villages near Gyeongju named Hahoe and Yangdong Folk Village were submitted for UNESCO heritages in 2008 or later by related cities and the South Korean government. Since the tombs were harder to break into than those of Baekje, a larger number of objects has been preserved. Notable amongst these are Silla&#x27;s elaborate gold crowns and jewelry.

The massive Bronze Bell of King Seongdeok the Great of Silla is known to produce a distinctive sound. Cheomseongdae near Gyeongju is the oldest extant astronomical observatory in East Asia but some disagree on its exact functions. It was built during the reign of Queen Seondeok (632–647).

It was from Silla that Korea&#x27;s oldest extant genre of poems, known as &quot;hyangga&quot;, developed and were recorded. Additionally, among the three kingdoms, Silla has the best preserved ancient Korean literature written in Classical Chinese, which includes the &quot;hanshi&quot; poetry of Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn, as well as the travelogue of Buddhist monk Hyecho.

Muslim traders brought the name &quot;Silla&quot; to the world outside the traditional East Asian sphere through the Silk Road. Geographers of the Arab and Persian world, including ibn Khurdadhbih, al-Masudi, Dimashiki, Al-Nuwayri, and al-Maqrizi, left records about Silla.

The current descendants to the Silla dynasty fall under the Park name. Family records since the last ruler have been provided, but these records have yet to be fully verified.

=== Native ethnic religion/Shamanism/Animism ===
The ancient indigenous native religion of Korea presented one of the most important aspects in early Korean society and involved the very lives of its people as well of its culture. One of the key features is the belief in the spirits of nature, that inhabit all the things in existence. Its presence is seen in Korean culture itself and could be considered inseparable from it, from cultural and national festivals such as Seollal and Chuseok, to many practices within Korean Buddhism that originate from it.

The ethnic religion of Silla was a key element within the Silla state and constituted the State religion around which many of the national rites, festivals and ceremonies revolved around. The ruler of Silla was simultaneously its religious head and one of the most revered figures in the nation, having a near deity/saint like status due to their descendance from the spirits of the skies. The title of the second ruler of Silla, Nurye &quot;Yuri&quot; Isageum, called &quot;Chachaung&quot; was one of the high shamans of the state for example.

The ruler also performed the national ceremonies to support the nation in upcoming times together with his sister serving as a high ranking shamaness figure only second to the ruler himself. Silla&#x27;s unique exceptionalist nationalism focused on the struggle for survival against the much more powerful neighbours of Goguryeo and Baekje.

The Hwarang order had its origin in Silla&#x27;s native religion as well, where the youth would strive to fight for their country and monarch. They would embark on nationalistic pilgrimages to seek out the spirits, who would grant them powers to vanquish their enemies. The Hwarang segi is one of the manuscripts that give insight into their lives and practices.

Springs and Mountains are some of the sources, where the spirits of life originate from, who sometimes take on the form of animals and girls.

When Silla adopted Buddhism, the previous ethnic religion was syncretized with the new faith and largely became synonymous to it. Buddhist deities are often treated the same way deities from the native religion are. Buddhism subsequently also found its way into native folk beliefs.

Shamanism remained important well into the Goryeo period, with a nativist uprising nominally led by a Buddhist court monk named Myocheong occurring in the 12th century.

The national festivals of Goryeo, Palgwanhoe and Yeondeunghoe, while they were Buddhist festivals were originally native shamanistic ones.

During Joseon shamans were still reached out to by the common folk, who for example often went to them to decide the names of their kids.

=== Buddhism ===
Centuries after Buddhism emerged in India, the strand called Mahayana Buddhism spread out of Central Asia, modern-day Afghanistan, and arrived in Silla the very last out of Goguryeo and Baekje due to its geographic isolation. In Korea, it was adopted as the state religion of 3 constituent polities of the Three Kingdoms Period, first by Goguryeo in 372 CE, by Silla in 528 CE, and by Baekje in 552 CE. Buddhism was introduced much more reluctantly compared to the two others to Silla in 528. Silla had been exposed to the religion for over a century during which the faith had certainly made inroads into the native populace and mixed with the native Shamanist and Animist folk religion to form the Korean specific form of Buddhism. The Buddhist monk Ado introduced Silla to Buddhism when he arrived to proselytize in the mid 5th century. The Samguk yusa and Samguk sagi following 3 monks among the first to bring Buddhist teaching, or Dharma, to Korea: Malananta (late 4th century) – an Indian Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to King Baekje of Baekje in the southern Korean peninsula in 384, Sundo – a Chinese Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea in 372, and Ado – a Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in central Korea. However, according to legend, the Silla monarchy was convinced to adopt the faith only by the martyrdom of the Silla general Ichadon, who was executed for his Buddhist faith by the Silla monarch in 527 only to have his blood flow the color of milk.

The importance of Buddhism in Silla society of the late early period is difficult to exaggerate. From King Beopheung and for the following six reigns Silla kings adopted Buddhist names and came to portray themselves as Buddhist–kings.
By the time of the 7th century, Buddhism in Korea reached its golden age with the advent of prominent, elite scholar-monks such as Wonhyo, Uisang, and Jajang that influenced East Asian philosophy and played pivotal roles in laying key ideas within East Asian Buddhism like Essence-Function. With the support of the government, massive temples like the Temple of the Golden Dragon, Temple of the Buddhist Realms and hermitages like Seokguram were built across the nation. Buddhist ideals and practices permeated the people&#x27;s daily lives regardless of class and the court, as well as the government, actively promoted Buddhism as a symbol of patriotism in times of invasions. The main assessment is that relics and temple ruins related to Silla found today were ahead of their time and surpassed those of Goryeo and Joseon in terms of size and extravagancy. Many Sillan monks who were part of the elite caste chose to expand their experience and knowledge by studying abroad in Tang China or travelling far west to India. Hyecho, known for his travelogue &quot;An Account of Travel to the Five Indian Kingdoms&quot;, was one of the many Korean monks that ventured to territories west to China yet to be visited by Koreans at that time.

Silla&#x27;s strong Buddhist nature is also reflected by the thousands of remnant Buddhist stone figures and carvings, mostly importantly on Namsan. The international influence of the Tang dynasty on these figures and carvings can be witnessed in the hallmarks of a round full form, a stern expression of the face, and drapery that clings to the body, but stylistic elements of native Korean culture can still be identified.

== Foreign relations ==

Korea&#x27;s and Iran&#x27;s long-running relationship started with cultural exchanges dating back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea era, more than 1600 years ago by the way of the Silk Road. A dark blue glass was found in the Cheonmachong Tomb, one of Silla&#x27;s royal tombs unearthed in Gyeongju. An exotic golden sword was found in Gyerim-ro, a street also located in Gyeongju. These are all relics that are presumed to be sent to Silla from ancient Iran or Persia through the Silk Road. Other items uncovered during the excavation include a silver bowl engraved with an image of the Persian goddess Anahita; a golden dagger from Persia; clay busts; and figurines portraying Middle Eastern merchants.

It was only during the Goryeo dynasty during Hyeonjeong&#x27;s reign when trade with Persia was officially recorded in Korean history. But in academic circles, it is presumed that both countries had active cultural exchanges during the 7th century Silla era which means the relationship between Korea and Iran began more than 1,500 years ago. &quot;In a history book written by the Persian scholar Khurdadbid, it states that Silla is located at the eastern end of China and reads &#x27;In this beautiful country Silla, there is much gold, majestic cities and hardworking people. Their culture is comparable with Persia&#x27;. &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;— the official chronicle of the Three Kingdoms era, compiled in 1145—contains further descriptions of commercial items sold by Middle Eastern merchants and widely used in Silla society. The influence of Iranian culture was profoundly felt in other ways as well, most notably in the fields of music, visual arts, and literature. The popularity of Iranian designs in Korea can be seen in the widespread use of pearl-studded roundels and symmetrical, zoomorphic patterns.

An ancient Persian epic poem, the Kushnameh, contains detailed descriptions of Silla. Former South Korean president Park Geun-hye said during a festival celebrating Iran and Korea&#x27;s 1,500 years of shared cultural ties, &quot;The Kushnameh, that tells of a Persian prince who went to Silla in the seventh century and got married with a Korean princess, thus forming a royal marriage.&quot;

Silla also traded indirectly with the Roman Empire through the Silk Road. Many Roman relics were excavated from the royal tombs of Silla, and it is presumed that Roman glass was a particularly popular luxury product among the high-ranking class. The Silla tombs where Roman glass has been proven to have been excavated include Geumnyeong Tomb, Cheonma Tomb, Hwangnamdae Tomb, and Nambun Tomb No. 98.

Silla was also a place of interest by the Japanese as the Nihon Shoki and the Kojiki both claim that the Japanese god, Susanoo (brother of Amaterasu) first emerged from the kingdom of Silla after being banished from the heavens, but soon left the peninsula for the Japanese archipelago after being dissatisfied with the land. He was also used as a means of spreading propaganda through Nissen dōsoron that Susanoo once reigned over Silla and that the modern Koreans are his descendants (in turn the Japanese), ultimately using him to justify the Japanese occupation of Korea.

<doc id="324222" wikidata="Q28179" url="?curid=324222" title="Joseon">
<text>Joseon ( ; ; , also romanized as Chosun), officially Great Joseon (; ), was a dynastic kingdom of Korea that existed for 505 years. It was founded by Taejo of Joseon in July 1392 and replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897. The kingdom was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city of Kaesong. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day Seoul. The kingdom&#x27;s northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amnok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens.

During its 500-year duration, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society. Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new state&#x27;s ideology. Buddhism was accordingly discouraged, and occasionally Buddhists faced persecutions. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the Korean peninsula and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. In the 1590s, the kingdom was severely weakened due to the two failed Japanese invasions of 1592 and 1598. Several decades later, Joseon was invaded by the Later Jin dynasty and the Qing dynasty in 1627 and 1636–1637 respectively, leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the &quot;hermit kingdom&quot; in Western literature. After the end of these invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. What power the kingdom recovered during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close. Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

The Joseon period has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern Korean culture, etiquette, norms, and societal attitudes toward current issues, along with the modern Korean language and its dialects, derive from the culture and traditions of Joseon. Modern Korean bureaucracy and administrative divisions were also established during the Joseon period.

==History==

=== Early period (late 14th-mid 16th century) ===

==== Founding ====
By the late 14th century, the nearly 500-year-old Goryeo established in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war spilled over from the disintegrating Yuan dynasty. Following the emergence of the Ming dynasty, the royal court in Goryeo split into two conflicting factions, one favouring neutrality and the other wanting to retake the Liaodong peninsula, which many in Goryeo believed was theirs. Goryeo remained a neutral third-party observer in the conflict between the Yuan and the Ming and had friendly diplomatic relations with both. In 1388, a Ming messenger came to Goryeo to demand that territories of the former Ssangseong Prefectures be handed over to Ming China. The tract of land was taken by Mongol forces during the invasion of Korea, but had been reclaimed by Goryeo in 1356 as the Yuan dynasty weakened. The act caused an uproar among the Goryeo court, and General Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng seized the chance to argue for an invasion of the Ming-controlled Liaodong Peninsula.

General Yi Sŏng-gye was chosen to lead the attack; he revolted, swept back to the capital Gaegyeong (now Kaesong) and initiated a coup d&#x27;état, overthrowing King U of Goryeo in favor of his son, Chang of Goryeo (1388). Neo-Confucian scholars, who were a small and medium-sized power at the time, were able to use this incident as an opportunity to lay a political foundation, and in particular, Jeong Do-jeon, a friend of Yi Sŏng-gye, wanted to use this incident as an opportunity to reform the corrupt nobles and the Buddhist community. He later killed King U and his son after a failed restoration and forcibly placed a royal named Wang Yo on the throne (he became King Gongyang of Goryeo). In 1392, Yi eliminated Chŏng Mong-ju, a highly respected leader of a group loyal to Goryeo dynasty, and dethroned King Gongyang, exiling him to Wonju, and he ascended the throne himself. The Goryeo kingdom had come to an end after 474 years of rule.

In the beginning of his reign, Yi Sŏng-gye, now ruler of Korea, intended to continue to use the name Goryeo for the country he ruled and simply change the royal line of descent to his own, thus maintaining the façade of continuing the 500-year-old Goryeo tradition. After numerous threats of mutiny from the drastically weakened but still influential Gwonmun nobles, who continued to swear allegiance to the remnants of the Goryeo and to the now-demoted Wang clan, the consensus in the reformed court was that a new dynastic title was needed to signify the change. In naming the new kingdom, Taejo contemplated two possibilities – &quot;Hwaryeong&quot; (his place of birth) and &quot;Joseon&quot;. After much internal deliberation, as well as endorsement by the neighboring Ming dynasty&#x27;s emperor, Taejo declared the name of the kingdom to be Joseon, a tribute to the ancient Korean state of Gojoseon. He also moved the capital to Hanseong (modern Seoul) from Gaegyeong (modern Kaesong).

==== Strifes of princes ====
When the new dynasty was brought into existence, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Yi Bang-won, Taejo&#x27;s fifth son by Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to assisting his father&#x27;s rise to power, Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon and Nam Eun used their influence on the king to name Yi Bang-seok, his eighth son (second son of Queen Sindeok), as crown prince in 1392. This conflict arose largely because Jeong Do-jeon, who shaped and laid down ideological, institutional, and legal foundations of the new kingdom more than anyone else, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by ministers appointed by the king while Yi Bang-won wanted to establish an absolute monarchy ruled directly by the king. With Taejo&#x27;s support, Jeong Do-jeon kept limiting the royal family&#x27;s power by prohibiting political involvement of princes and attempting to abolish their private armies. Both sides were well aware of each other&#x27;s great animosity and were getting ready to strike first.

After the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife, Yi Bang-won struck first by raiding the palace and killed Jeong Do-jeon and his supporters as well as Queen Sindeok&#x27;s two sons (his half-brothers) including the crown prince in 1398. This incident became known as the &quot;First Strife of Princes&quot;.

Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo abdicated and immediately crowned his second son Yi Bang-gwa as King Jeongjong. One of King Jeongjong&#x27;s first acts as monarch was to revert the capital to Gaegyeong, where he is believed to have been considerably more comfortable, away from the toxic power strife. Yet Yi Bang-won retained real power and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled older brother, Yi Bang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, the tensions between Yi Bang-won&#x27;s faction and Yi Bang-gan&#x27;s camp escalated into an all-out conflict that came to be known as the &quot;Second Strife of Princes&quot;. In the aftermath of the struggle, the defeated Yi Bang-gan was exiled to Dosan while his supporters were executed. Thoroughly intimidated, King Jeongjong immediately invested Yi Bang-won as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bang-won assumed the throne of Joseon as King Taejong, third king of the dynasty.

=====Consolidation of royal power=====
In the beginning of Taejong&#x27;s reign, the former King Taejo refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of any king&#x27;s rule. Regardless, Taejong initiated policies he believed would prove his qualification to rule. One of his first acts as king was to abolish the privilege enjoyed by the upper echelons of government and the aristocracy to maintain private armies. His revocation of such rights to field independent forces effectively severed their ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of men employed in the national military. Taejong&#x27;s next act as king was to revise the existing legislation concerning the taxation of land ownership and the recording of state of subjects. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national income increased twofold.

In 1399, Taejong had played an influential role in scrapping the Dopyeong Assembly, a council of the old government administration that held a monopoly in court power during the waning years of Goryeo, in favor of the State Council of Joseon, a new branch of central administration that revolved around the king and his edicts. After passing the subject documentation and taxation legislation, he issued a new decree in which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers and advisors making decisions through debate and negotiations amongst themselves, and thus brought the royal power to new heights.

Shortly thereafter, Taejong installed an office, known as the Sinmun Office, to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by government officials or aristocrats. He kept Jeong Do-jeon&#x27;s reforms intact for the most part. In addition, Taejong executed or exiled many of his supporters who had helped him ascend the throne to strengthen his own royal authority. To limit the influence of in-laws, he killed all four of his wife&#x27;s brothers and Shim On, the father-in-law of his son Sejong.

Taejong remains a controversial figure who killed many of his rivals and relatives to gain power and yet ruled effectively to improve the populace&#x27;s lives, strengthen national defense, and lay down a solid foundation for his successor Sejong&#x27;s rule.

=====Sejong the Great=====

In August 1418, following Taejong&#x27;s abdication two months earlier, Sejong the Great ascended the throne. In May 1419, King Sejong, under the advice and guidance of his father Taejong, embarked upon the Gihae Eastern Expedition to remove the nuisance of waegu (coastal pirates) who had been operating out of Tsushima Island.

In September 1419, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Tsushima, Sadamori, capitulated to the Joseon court. In 1443, The Treaty of Gyehae was signed in which the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Tsushima was granted rights to conduct trade with Korea using fifty ships per year in exchange for sending tribute to Korea and aiding to stop any Waegu coastal pirate raids on Korean ports.

On the northern border, Sejong established four forts and six posts to safeguard his people from the Jurchens, who later became the Manchus, living in Manchuria. In 1433, Sejong sent Kim Chongsŏ, a government official, north to fend off the Jurchens. Kim&#x27;s military campaign captured several castles, pushed north, and expanded Korean territory, roughly the current border between North Korea and China.

During the rule of Sejong, Korea saw advances in natural science, agriculture, literature, traditional Chinese medicine, and engineering. Because of such success, Sejong was given the title &quot;Sejong the Great&quot;. The most remembered contribution of King Sejong is the creation of Hangul, the Korean alphabet, in 1443. Rejected in its time by the scholarly elite, the everyday use of Hanja in writing was eventually surpassed by Hangul in the latter half of the 20th century.

=====Six martyred ministers=====
After King Sejong&#x27;s death, his son Munjong continued his father&#x27;s legacy but soon died of illness in 1452, just two years after his coronation. He was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son, Danjong. In addition to two regents, Princess Gyeonghye also served as Danjong&#x27;s guardian and, along with the general Kim Chongsŏ, attempted to strengthen royal authority. Danjong&#x27;s uncle, Grand Prince Suyang, gained control of the government and eventually deposed his nephew to become the seventh king of Joseon himself in 1455, taking the name Sejo. After six ministers loyal to Danjong attempted to assassinate Sejo to return Danjong to the throne, Sejo executed the six ministers and also killed Danjong in his place of exile.

King Sejo enabled the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. He also revised the land ordinance to improve the national economy and encouraged the publication of books. Most importantly, he compiled the Grand Code for State Administration, which became the cornerstone of dynastic administration and provided the first form of constitutional law in a written form in Korea.

Sejo undermined much of the foundation of many existing systems, including the Jiphyeonjeon which his predecessors, Sejong and Munjong, had carefully laid down. He cut down on everything he deemed unworthy and caused countless complications in the long run. Many of these adjustments were done for his own power, not regarding the consequences and problems that would occur. The favoritism he showed toward the ministers who aided him in taking the throne led to increased corruption in the higher echelon of the political field.

=====Institutional arrangements and Prosper culture=====
Sejo&#x27;s weak son Yejong succeeded him as the eighth king, but died two years later in 1469. Yejong&#x27;s nephew Seongjong ascended the throne. His reign was marked by the prosperity and growth of the national economy and the rise of neo-Confucian scholars called sarim who were encouraged by Seongjong to enter court politics. He established Hongmungwan, the royal library and advisory council composed of Confucian scholars, with whom he discussed philosophy and government policies. He ushered in a cultural golden age that rivaled Sejong&#x27;s reign by publishing numerous books on geography, ethics, and various other fields.

He also sent several military campaigns against the Jurchens on the northern border in 1491, like many of his predecessors. The campaign, led by General Heo Jong, was successful, and the defeated Jurchens, led by the Udige clan (兀狄哈), retreated to the north of the Yalu River. King Seongjong was succeeded by his son, Yeonsangun, in 1494.

====Literati purges====

Yeonsangun is often considered the worst tyrant in Joseon&#x27;s history, whose reign was marked by literati purges between 1498 and 1506. His behavior became erratic after he learned that his biological mother was not Queen Junghyeon but the deposed Queen Yun, who was forced to drink poison after poisoning one of Seongjong&#x27;s concubines out of jealousy and leaving a scratch mark on Seongjong&#x27;s face. When he was shown a piece of clothing that was allegedly stained with his mother&#x27;s blood vomited after drinking poison, he beat two of Seongjong&#x27;s concubines, who had accused Queen Yun to death, and pushed his grandmother, Grand Queen Dowager Insu, who died afterward. He executed government officials who supported Queen Yun&#x27;s death along with their families. He also executed sarim scholars for writing phrases critical of Sejo&#x27;s usurpation of the throne.

Yeonsangun also seized a thousand women from the provinces to serve as palace entertainers and appropriated the Sungkyunkwan as a personal pleasure ground. He abolished the Office of Censors, whose function was to criticize inappropriate actions and policies of the king, and Hongmungwan. He banned the use of hangul when the common people used it on posters to criticize the king. After twelve years of misrule, he was finally deposed in a coup which placed his half-brother Jungjong on the throne in 1506.

Jungjong was a fundamentally weak king because of the circumstances that placed him on the throne, but his reign also saw a period of significant reforms led by his minister Jo Gwang-jo, the charismatic leader of sarim. He established a local self-government system called hyangyak to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among the people, sought to reduce the gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers more equally and limit the amount of land and number of slaves that one could own, promulgated Confucian writings with vernacular translations widely among the populace, and sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats. According to the &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because as Inspector General, he applied the law strictly.

These radical reforms were very popular with the populace but were fiercely opposed by the conservative officials who had helped to put Jungjong on the throne. They plotted to cause Jungjong to doubt Jo&#x27;s loyalty. Jo Gwang-jo was executed, and most of his reform measures died with him in the resulting third literati purge. For nearly 50 years afterward, the court politics were marred by bloody and chaotic struggles between factions backing rival consorts and princes. In-laws of the royal family wielded great power and contributed to much corruption in that era.

===Middle period (mid 16th-mid 17th century)===
The middle Joseon period was marked by intense and bloody power struggles between political factions that weakened the country, and by large-scale invasions by Japan and Manchu which nearly toppled the kingdom.

====Factional struggle====
The Sarim faction had suffered a series of political defeats during the reigns of Yeonsangun, Jungjong, and Myeongjong, but it gained control of the government during the reign of King Seonjo. It soon split into opposing factions known as the Easterners and the Westerners by their political or philosophical masters. Easterners mainly followed the teachings and philosophy of Yi Hwang and Jo Sik while the Westerners followed the philosophy of Yi I and Song Hon. Within decades the Easterners themselves divided into the Southerners and the Northerners; in the seventeenth century the Westerners also permanently split into the Noron and the Soron. Factions in the Joseon dynasty were formed based on their different interpretations of Confucian philosophy, which mainly differed according to who their master was and what they believed in. The alternations in power among these factions were often accompanied by charges of treason and bloody purges, initiating a cycle of revenge with each change of regime.

One example is the 1589 rebellion of Jeong Yeo-rip, one of the bloodiest political purges of Joseon. Jeong Yeo-rip, an Easterner, had formed a society with a group of supporters that also received military training to fight against Waegu. There is still a dispute about the nature and purpose of his group, which reflected the desire for a classless society and spread throughout Honam. He was subsequently accused of conspiracy to start a rebellion. Jeong Cheol, head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used this event to affect the widespread purge of Easterners who had the slightest connection to Jeong Yeo-rip. Eventually 1000 Easterners were killed or exiled in the aftermath.

====Japanese invasions====
Throughout Korean history, there was frequent piracy on sea and brigandage on land. The only purpose for the Joseon navy was to secure the maritime trade against the Waegu. The navy repelled pirates using an advanced form of gunpowder technologies including cannons and fire arrows in form of singijeon deployed by hwacha.

During the Japanese invasions in the 1590s, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, plotting the conquest of Ming China with Portuguese guns, invaded Korea with his &quot;daimyōs&quot; and their troops, intending to use Korea as a stepping stone. Factional division in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon&#x27;s part. The use of superior firearms by the Japanese left most of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula occupied within months, with both Hanseong (present-day Seoul) and Pyongyang captured.
The invasion was slowed when Admiral Yi Sun-shin destroyed the Japanese invasion fleet. The guerrilla resistance that eventually formed also helped. Local resistance slowed down the Japanese advance and decisive naval victories by Admiral Yi left control over sea routes in Korean hands, severely hampering Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, Ming China intervened on the side of the Koreans, sending a large force in 1593 which pushed back the Japanese together with the Koreans.

During the war, Koreans developed powerful firearms and the turtle ships. The Joseon and Ming forces defeated the Japanese at a deep price. Following the war, relations between Korea and Japan were completely suspended until 1609.

====Manchu invasions====

After the Japanese invasions, the Korean Peninsula was devastated. Meanwhile, Nurhaci (r. 1583–1626), the chieftain of the Jianzhou Jurchens, was unifying the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria into a strong coalition that his son Hong Taiji (r. 1626–1643) would eventually rename the &quot;Manchus&quot;. After he declared Seven Grievances against Ming China in 1618, Nurhaci and the Ming engaged in several military conflicts. On such occasions, Nurhaci required help from Gwanghaegun of Joseon (r. 1608–1623), putting the Korean state in a difficult position because the Ming court was also requesting assistance. Gwanghaegun tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting Ming China, which had saved Joseon during Hideyoshi&#x27;s invasions.

In 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by Injo of Joseon (r. 1623–1649), who banished Gwanghaegun&#x27;s supporters. Reverting his predecessor&#x27;s foreign policy, the new king decided to openly support the Ming, but a rebellion led by military commander Yi Gwal erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon&#x27;s military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.

In 1627, a Jurchen army of 30,000 led by Nurhaci&#x27;s nephew Amin overran Joseon&#x27;s defenses. After a quick campaign that was assisted by northern yangban who had supported Gwanghaegun, the Jurchens imposed a treaty that forced Joseon to accept &quot;brotherly relations&quot; with the Jurchen kingdom. Because Injo persisted in his anti-Manchu policies, Qing emperor Hong Taiji sent a punitive expedition of 120,000 men to Joseon in 1636. Defeated, King Injo was forced to end his relations with the Ming and recognize the Qing as suzerain instead. Injo&#x27;s successor Hyojong of Joseon (r. 1649–1659) tried to form an army to keep his enemies away and conquer the Qing for revenge, but could never act on his designs.

Despite reestablishing economic relations by officially entering the imperial Chinese tributary system, Joseon leaders and intellectuals remained resentful of the Manchus, whom they regarded as barbarians, and regarded the Ming dynasty as the center of the civilized world. Joseon intellectuals, who had political and cultural allegiances to the Ming dynasty, were forced to reexamine their state identity when the Qing overthrew the Ming, leading to an influx of Ming refugees into Joseon. As a result, Joseon created the Little China ideology, known as sojunghwa. According to Youngmin Kim, &quot; it held that the Joseon embodied Chineseness authentically while other neighboring countries failed to do so in the face of the barbarian domination of the center of the civilized world.&quot; A set of standardized rites and unifying symbols were developed in Late Joseon Korea to maintain that sense of cultural identity. Long after submitting to the Qing, the Joseon court and many Korean intellectuals kept using Ming reign periods, as when a scholar marked 1861 as &quot;the 234th year of Chongzhen&quot;.

===Late period (mid 17th-late 19th century)===
====Emergence of Silhak and renaissance of the Joseon====

After invasions from Japan and Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Joseon witnessed the emergence of Silhak (Practical Learning). The early group of Silhak scholars advocated comprehensive reform of civil service examination, taxation, natural sciences and the improvement in agromanagerial and agricultural techniques. It aimed to rebuild Joseon society after it had been devastated by the two invasions. Under the leadership of Kim Yuk, the chief minister of King Hyeonjong, the implementation of reforms proved highly advantageous both to state revenues and to the lot of the peasants.

The co-existence system between Southerners and Westerners which were established after the Injo coup started to fall. After the Yesong debate, factional conflict grew particularly intense under the reigns of the kings Sukjong and Gyeongjong, with major rapid reversals of the ruling faction, known as hwanguk (換局; literally &quot;change in the state of affairs&quot;), being commonplace. During the early reign of Sukjong, the southerners managed to become a ruling faction and made westerners lose power. But the southerners&#x27; rise to power was temporary. Sukjong, who believed that political faction would weaken the king&#x27;s power started rapid reversals of the ruling faction, which resulted in bloody killings between factions. After the three bloody hwanguk, the Southerners lost their influence in the central government, and the ruling Westerners were divided into hard-line Noron who rejected the Southerners and moderate Soron who were friendly to the Southerners. This shift resulted in political radicalism which viewed other factions as the ones that should be eliminated. In response, the next kings, Yeongjo (r. 1724–1776) and Jeongjo (r. 1776–1800), generally pursued the &quot;Tangpyeongchaek&quot; – a policy of maintaining balance and equality between the factions.

The two kings led a second renaissance of the Joseon kingdom. Yeongjo&#x27;s grandson, the enlightened King Jeongjo enacted various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Kyujanggak, a royal library to improve the cultural and political position of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to run the nation. King Jeongjo also spearheaded bold social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would previously have been barred because of their social status. King Jeongjo had the support of the many Silhak scholars. King Jeongjo&#x27;s reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon&#x27;s popular culture. At that time, the group of Silhak scholars encouraged the individual to reflect on state traditions and lifestyle, initiating the studies of Korea that addressed its history, geography, epigraphy and language.

====Architecture====
During the late Joseon period of the 18th and 19th centuries, Joseon started to change its perceptions of the Qing dynasty. The shift in perceptions commenced through the introduction of Qing dynasty culture to Joseon society by Yeonhaengsa, Korean envoys to the Qing dynasty. Progressive-thinking Joseon intellectuals advocated the Bukhak theory, which argued that Joseon should adopt Qing and Western culture through the Qing dynasty. Joseon scholars became intrigued by the sophisticated architectural technology of China, encompassing construction techniques, wagon utilization, and the ondol heating system. Particularly fascinated by brick, the proponents of Bukhak endeavored to popularize its usage across Joseon, and eventually succeeded. Bak Jiwon was among the first to construct brick Chinese-style buildings in Anui, Gyeongsang Province, and Gyedong, Seoul, towards the end of the 18th century. Following the establishment of the Suwon Hwaseong Fortress, which was influenced by Qing construction technology and techniques, Qing-style architectural style and techniques started to become more widespread in Joseon society.

==== Government by in-law families ====
After the death of King Jeongjo, the Joseon faced difficult external and internal problems. Internally, the foundation of national law and order weakened as a result of &quot;Sedo Politics&quot; (in-law government) by royal in-laws.

The young Sunjo succeeded his father, King Jeongjo, in 1800. With Jeongjo&#x27;s death the Noron seized power with the regency of Queen Dowager Jeongsun, whose family had strong ties to the faction, and initiated a persecution of Catholics. However, after the retirement and death of the Queen Dowager, the Norons were gradually ousted, while the Andong Kim clan of Kim Jo-sun, the father of the Queen Sunwon, gained power. Gradually the Andong Kims came to dominate the court.

With the domination of the Andong Kims, the era of Sedo Politics began. The formidable in-law lineage monopolized the vital positions in government, holding sway over the political scene, and intervening in the succession of the throne. These kings had no monarchic authority and could not rule over the government. The other aristocratic families, overwhelmed by the power exercised by the royal in-laws, could not speak out. As the power was concentrated in the hands of the royal in-law lineage, there was disorder in the governing process, and corruption became rampant. Large sums were offered in bribes to the powerful lineages to obtain positions with nominally high rank. Even the low-ranking posts were bought and sold. This period, which spanned 60 years, saw the manifestation of both severe poverty among the Korean population and ceaseless rebellions in various parts of the country.

Externally, Joseon became increasingly isolationist. Its rulers sought to limit contact with foreign countries.

==== End of the dynasty ====

In 1863, King Gojong took the throne. His father, Heungseon Daewongun, ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. During the mid-1860s the Regent was the main proponent of isolationism and the instrument of the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the French Campaign against Korea in 1866. The early years of his rule also witnessed a large effort to restore the dilapidated Gyeongbokgung, the seat of royal authority. From 1862 to 1864, an insurgency movement driven by Donghak followers and religious leader Choe Je-u gathered a peasant army to take over southern parts of Korea until Choe was executed in 1864.

During his reign, the power and authority of the in-law families such as the Andong Kims sharply declined. To get rid of the Andong Kim and Pungyang Jo clans, he promoted persons without making references to political party or family affiliations, and to reduce the burdens of the people and solidify the basis of the nation&#x27;s economy, he reformed the tax system. In 1871, U.S. and Korean forces clashed in a U.S. attempt at &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; following on the General Sherman incident of 1866.

In 1873, King Gojong announced his assumption of royal rule. With the subsequent retirement of Heungseon Daewongun, Queen Min (later called Empress Myeongseong) became a power in the court, placing her family in high court positions.

Japan, after the Meiji Restoration, acquired Western military technology, and forced Joseon to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876, opening three ports to trade and granting the Japanese extraterritoriality. Port Hamilton was briefly occupied by the Royal Navy in 1885.
Many Koreans despised Japanese and foreign influences over their land and the corrupt oppressive rule of the Joseon dynasty. In 1881, the Byeolgigun, a modern elite military unit, was formed with Japanese trainers. The salaries of the other soldiers were held back, and in 1882 rioting soldiers attacked the Japanese officers and even forced the queen to take refuge in the countryside. In 1894, the Donghak Peasant Revolution saw farmers rise up in a mass rebellion, with peasant leader Jeon Bong-jun defeating the forces of local ruler Jo Byong-gap at the battle of Gobu on January 11, 1894; after the battle, Jo&#x27;s properties were handed out to the peasants. By May, the peasant army had reached Jeonju, and the Joseon government asked the Qing dynasty government for assistance in ending the revolt. The Qing sent 3,000 troops, and the rebels negotiated a truce, but the Japanese considered the Qing presence a threat and sent in 8,000 troops of their own, seizing the Royal Palace in Seoul and installing a pro-Japanese government on June 8, 1894. This soon escalated into a war (1894–1895) between Japan and the Qing Empire, fought largely in Korea. (The king made a deal with Japan, partially out of a distrust of the queen&#x27;s support for open trade policies toward the Western civilizations and China. He ended up preempting a specific disadvantageous, exclusive negotiation with Japan previous to the Queen&#x27;s decision, which was later used as a political premise for Japan to wage military action. Scholars, particularly during the Joseon era, were touted for expressing allegiance to the king.)

Empress Myeongseong (referred to as Queen Min) had attempted to counter Japanese interference in Korea and was considering turning to the Russian Empire and to China for support. In 1895, Empress Myeongseong was assassinated by Japanese agents. The Japanese minister to Korea, Lieutenant-General Viscount Miura, almost certainly orchestrated the plot against her. A group of Japanese agents entered the palace Gyeongbokgung in Seoul, which was under Japanese control, and Queen Min was killed and her body desecrated in the north wing of the palace.

The Qing acknowledged defeat in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (April 17, 1895), which officially guaranteed Korea&#x27;s independence from China. It was a step toward Japan gaining regional hegemony in Korea.

==== Establishment of the Empire and Colonization ====
The Joseon court, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the Korean Empire, along with the Gwangmu Reform in 1897. King Gojong assumed the title of Emperor to assert Korea&#x27;s independence. In addition, other foreign powers were sought for military technology, especially Russia, to fend off the Japanese. Technically, 1897 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the empire was changed; the Joseon dynasty still reigned, albeit perturbed by Japan and Russia.

In a complicated series of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers, Japan pushed back the Russian fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in 1904. With the conclusion of the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War with the Treaty of Portsmouth, the way was open for Japan to take control of Korea. After the signing of the Protectorate Treaty in 1905, Korea became a protectorate of Japan. Prince Itō was the first Resident-General of Korea, although he was assassinated by Korean independence activist An Jung-geun in 1909 at the train station at Harbin. In 1910 the Japanese Empire finally annexed Korea.

==Government==

Joseon was a highly centralized monarchy, and neo-Confucian bureaucracy as codified by Gyeongguk daejeon, a sort of Joseon constitution.

=== King ===


The king had absolute authority, but his actual power varied with political circumstances. He was bound by tradition, precedents set by earlier kings, Gyeongguk daejeon, and Confucian teachings. The king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to persuade the king to the right path if the latter was thought to be mistaken. Natural disasters were thought to be due to the king&#x27;s failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences. When there was severe drought or a series of disasters, the king often formally sought criticism from officials and citizenry. On those occasions, critics were immune from prosecution, regardless of what they said or wrote (although there were a few exceptions).

Direct communication between the king and the common people was possible through the &quot;sangeon&quot; () written petition system and the &quot;gyeokjaeng&quot; () oral petition system. Through the &quot;gyeokjaeng&quot; oral petition system, commoners could strike a gong or drum in front of the palace or during the king&#x27;s public processions to appeal their grievances or petition to the king directly. This allowed even the illiterate members of Joseon society to make a petition to the king. More than 1,300 &quot;gyeokjaeng&quot;-related accounts are recorded in the Ilseongnok.

==== Royal seals ====

===Officials===
Government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from first senior rank () down to ninth junior rank (). Seniority and promotion was achieved through royal decree, based on examination or recommendation. The officials from 1st senior rank to 3rd senior rank wore red robes. Those from 3rd junior rank to 6th junior rank wore blue. Those below wore green robes.

Here, &quot;government official&quot; means one who occupied an office which gave its holder yangban status – hereditary nobility for three generations. To become such an official, one had to pass a series of gwageo examinations. There were three kinds of gwageo exams – literary, military, and miscellaneous. The literary route was the most prestigious. Many key posts, including all Censorate posts, were open only to officials who advanced through literary exam. The literary route involved a series of four tests. To qualify, one had to pass them all. 33 candidates who were chosen in this manner would take the final exam, before the king. The candidate with the highest score was appointed to a position of 6th junior rank (a jump of six ranks). The two candidates with the next highest scores were appointed to a position of 7th junior rank. The seven candidates with next highest scores were assigned to 8th junior rank. The remaining 23 candidates were given 9th junior rank, the lowest of 18 ranks.

The officials of 1st senior rank, 1st junior rank, and 2nd senior rank were addressed with honorific &quot;daegam&quot; () while those of 2nd junior rank and 3rd senior rank were addressed with honorific &quot;yeonggam&quot; (). These red-robed officials, collectively called &quot;dangsanggwan&quot; (), took part in deciding government policies by attending cabinet meetings. The rest of the ranked officials were called &quot;danghagwan&quot; ().

===Central government===
====State Council====

State Council (Uijeongbu, 의정부, 議政府) was the highest deliberative body, whose power declined over the course of the period. The Chief State Councillor (Yeonguijeong, 영의정, 領議政), Left State Councillor (Jwauijeong, 좌의정, 左議政), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, 우의정, 右議政) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (all three were of 1st senior rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, 좌찬성, 左贊成) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, 우찬성, 右贊成), both of 1st junior rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king&#x27;s power. There were periods when it directly controlled the Six Ministries, the chief executive body of Joseon government, but it primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions concurrently.

====Six Ministries====

Six Ministries (Yukjo, 육조, 六曹) make up the chief executive body. Each minister (Panseo, 판서, 判書) was of 2nd senior rank and was assisted by deputy minister (Champan, 참판, 參判), who was of 2nd junior rank. Ministry of Personnel was the most senior office of six ministries. As the influence of State Council waned over time, Minister of Personnel was often de facto head of ministers. Six ministries are in the order of seniority.

:*Ministry of Personnel (Ijo, 이조, 吏曹) – was primarily concerned with appointment of officials
:*Ministry of Taxation (Hojo, 호조, 戶曹) – taxation, finances, census, agriculture, and land policies
:*Ministry of Rites (Yejo, 예조, 禮曺) – rituals, culture, diplomacy, gwageo exam
:*Ministry of Defence (Byeongjo, 병조, 兵曺) – military affairs
:**Office of Police Bureau (Podocheong, 포도청, 捕盜廳) – office for public order
:*Ministry of Justice (Hyeongjo, 형조, 刑曺) – administration of law, slavery, punishments
:*Ministry of Commerce (Gongjo, 공조, 工曹) – industry, public works, manufacturing, mining
Government offices of each organization were located where the current Gwanghwamun Plaza is located. So it was also called Yukjo street after the six ministries.

====Three Offices====

Three Offices, or &quot;Samsa&quot; (), is a collective name for three offices that functioned as major organ of press and provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. While modeled after the Chinese system, they played much more prominent roles in the Joseon government than their Chinese counterparts. In their role as organ of press, they did not have actual authority to decide or implement policies, but had influential voice in the ensuing debate.

The officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but had strong academic reputation and enjoyed special privileges and great prestige (for instance, censors were permitted to drink during working hours because of their function of criticizing the king). To be appointed, they went through more thorough review of character and family background. Three Offices provided the fastest route of promotion to high posts and was almost a requirement to becoming a State Councillor.
:*Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu, 사헌부) – It monitored government administration and officials at each level in both central and local governments for corruption, malfeasance, or inefficiency. It was also in charge of advancing public morals and Confucian customs and redressing grievances of the populace. It was headed by Inspector General (Daesaheon, 대사헌), a position of 2nd junior rank, who oversaw 30 largely independent officials.
:*Office of Censors (Saganwon, 사간원) – Its chief function was to remonstrate with the king if there was wrong or improper action or policy. Important decrees of the king were first reviewed by censors, who could ask for them to be withdraw if they judged them improper. It also issued opinions about the general state of affairs. It was composed of five officials, led by the Chief Censor (Daesagan, 대사간), of 3rd senior rank.
While the primary focus for Office of Inspector General is the government officials and Office of Censors is focused on the king, two offices often performed each other&#x27;s functions, and there was much overlap. Together they were called &quot;Yangsa&quot;, () which literally means &quot;Both Offices&quot;, and often worked jointly especially when they sought to reverse the king&#x27;s decision.
:*Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan, 홍문관, 弘文館) – It oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king&#x27;s questions. Its officials took part in the daily lessons called &quot;gyeongyeon&quot; (), in which they discussed history and Confucian philosophy with the king. Since these discussions often led to commentary on current political issues, its officials had significant influence as advisors. It was headed by Chief Scholar (Daejehak, 대제학), a part-time post of 2nd senior rank that served concurrently in another high post (such as in State Council), and Deputy Chief Scholar (Bujehak, 부제학), a full-time post of 3rd senior rank that actually ran the office. There was great prestige attached to being Chief Scholar in this deeply Confucian society. The office was established to replace Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon, 집현전) after the latter was abolished by King Sejo in the aftermath of Six martyred ministers.

====Other offices====
The major offices include the following:
*Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, 승정원) served as a liaison between the king and Six Ministries. There were six royal secretaries (), one for each ministry, and all were of 3rd senior rank. Their primary role was to pass down royal decree to the ministries and submit petitions from the officials and the populace to the king, but they also advised the king and served in other key positions close to the king. In particular Chief Royal Secretary (), a liaison to Ministry of Personnel, served the king in the closest proximity of all government official and often enjoyed great power that was derived from the king&#x27;s favor. Hong Guk-yeong (during Jeongjo&#x27;s reign) and Han Myeong-hoe (during Sejo) are some examples of chief royal secretaries who were the most powerful officials of their time.
*Capital Bureau (Hanseongbu, 한성부) was in charge of running the capital, &quot;Hanseong&quot; (now Seoul). It was led by &quot;Panyoon&quot; (), of 2nd senior second rank equivalent to today&#x27;s mayor of Seoul.
*Royal Investigation Bureau (Uigeumbu, 의금부) was an investigative and enforcement organ under direct control of the king. It chiefly dealt with treason and other serious cases that concerned the king and royal family and served to arrest, investigate, imprison, and carry out sentences against the suspected offenders, who were often government officials.
*Office of Records (Chunchugwan, 춘추관) officials wrote, compiled, and maintained the government and historical records. It was headed by State Councillors, and many posts were held by officials serving in other offices concurrently. There were eight historiographers whose sole function was to record the meetings for history.
* Sungkyunkwan or Royal Academy () prepared future government officials. Those who passed first two stages of gwageo examinations (literary exam) were admitted to Sungkyunkwan. The class size was usually 200 students, who lived in the residential hall and followed strict routine and school rules. (Tuition, room and board were provided by the government.) It also served as the state shrine for Confucian and Korean Confucian sages. The students&#x27; opinions on government policies, especially collective statements and demonstrations, could be influential as they represented fresh and uncorrupted consensus of young scholars. The official in charge was Daesaseong (), of 3rd senior rank, and 36 other officials including those from other offices were involved in running the academy.

===Local government===
The officials of high rank were sent from the central government. Sometimes a secret royal inspector (Amhaengeosa, 암행어사) was appointed by the king to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials. These undercover inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but were invested with the royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.
* Provinces (Do, 도, 道) – There were eight provinces, each of which was governed by Governor (Gwanchalsa, 관찰사, 觀察使), a position of 2nd junior rank.
* Bu () – administrative offices in charge of major cities in provinces. Each bu was led by Buyun (), which was equivalent to Governor in rank.
* Mok () – There were twenty moks, which governed large counties named ju (). They were run by Moksa (), of 3rd senior rank.
* County (Gun, 군, 郡) – There were eighty counties in Joseon, each governed by Gunsu (), a 4th junior rank.
* Hyeon () – Large hyeons were governed by Hyeonryeong () of 5th junior rank while smaller hyeons were governed by Hyeongam () of 6th junior rank.

=== Administrative divisions ===
During most of the Joseon period, Korea was divided into eight provinces (do, 도, 道). The eight provinces&#x27; boundaries remained unchanged for almost five centuries from 1413 to 1895, and formed a geographic paradigm that is still reflected today in the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s administrative divisions, dialects, and regional distinctions. The names of all eight provinces are still preserved today, in one form or another.
=== Military ===
==== Army ====

The army consists of the central army and the provincial armies. Each is made of peasant soldiers, cavalry, &quot;pengbaesu&quot; and &quot;gabsa&quot; elite soldiers, archers, musketeers, and artillery. The king appointed their generals.

==== Navy ====

The Joseon Navy consists of two types of main warships, the panokseon and the turtle ship. They also used small vessels and fishing boats for reconnaissance and landings. The king also appoints their admirals.

==== Royal Guard ====

The Naegeumwi were royal guards defending the king, queen, and ministers. These were soldiers hand-selected by the king. The King&#x27;s Royal Palace Gatekeepers, the &quot;Wanggung Sumunjang&quot; () were a royal guard unit tasked with defending the gates of the five palaces and Hanseong&#x27;s city gates.

== Foreign relations ==

Joseon was a tributary state of the China that was ritually subordinate to the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty but exercised a high level of independence and sovereignty. The ruling Yi family proclaimed their indigenous legitimacy but institutionalized structures that limited Joseon monarch power, which modern scholars view as producing contradictory statuses from a modern view of sovereignty. Joseon maintained the highest position among China&#x27;s tributary states, which also included countries such as Japan, Vietnam, Ryukyu, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, and the Philippines, among others. In addition, Joseon received tribute from Jurchens and Sō clan of Tsushima until the 17th century, and had a small enclave in the Ryukyu Kingdom that engaged in trade with Siam and Java.

===China===

In 1392, General Yi Sŏng-gye led a successful coup to take political power in Korea from the King. General Yi&#x27;s followers forced him to take the crown as Taejo of Joseon, thus establishing a new dynasty. In search of a justification for its rule given the lack of a royal bloodline, the new regime wanted recognition from other countries such as China. Furthermore, the only way to establish diplomatic relations and trade with China was to accept the tributary system of China. Thus, Joseon joined the Imperial Chinese tributary system in 1401 within the context of the Mandate of Heaven, in return for recognition. Within this tributary system, China assumed the role of a &quot;big brother&quot;, with Korea maintaining the highest position among the tributary states, which also included countries such as the Ashikaga shogunate, Ryukyu Kingdom, Lan Xang, Đại Việt, and the Ayutthaya Kingdom, in return for accepting the subordinate tributary role of a &quot;younger brother&quot;. A series diplomatic ventures illustrate the persistence of Joseon&#x27;s &quot;sadae&quot; (serving the great or serving Ming China) diplomacy in dealings with Ming dynasty. &quot;Sadae&quot; construes China as the center of a Confucian moral universe. and describes a foreign policy characterized by the various ways a weaker nation-state such as Korea acknowledges the strength of a greater power such as China. &quot;Sadae&quot; is made manifest in the actions of the weaker nation-state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys. &quot;Sadaejuui&quot; conflates an attitude of subservience with the political realism which accompanies the prudent recognition of greater power. As a foundation of diplomacy, the Joseon kingdom presumed that the Korean state was positioned within a Sinocentristic milieu.

During the 1400s, the connection between Ming and Joseon was mainly pragmatic and somewhat contractual. The concept of Sadae implied a commitment to serve Ming China, and depending on the international context, the dominant state could be substituted. However, by the early 1500s, the relationship between Ming and Joseon was reinforced through a father-son dynamic, as Joseon elites began to regard the Ming emperor not just as a suzerain but also as a ritual father figure. This transformation held significant weight because, unlike the changeable loyalty to a ruler, the Confucian principle of filial piety was considered immutable and irrevocable. The lasting effect of the Ming-Joseon relationship on the Joseon elites endured well beyond the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the mid-1600s, molding the prevailing political and intellectual developments within Joseon Korea. This influence is evident in the construction of the Taebodan, the Altar of Great Gratitude, and the Mandongmyo, an Eastern Shrine dedicated to Ming emperors, within Korea. These structures, erected in 1704 within a palace courtyard and a local private academy respectively, served as tributes to the memory of selected Ming emperors, to honor the memory of specific Ming emperors.

Joseon&#x27;s perceptions of the Qing dynasty were significantly influenced by Sungmyeongbancheong, which means worship of Ming and disdain for Qing, prior to the middle of the 18th century. The Joseon dynasty was characterized by strong anti-Qing sentiments and allegiance to the Ming dynasty. According to the &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, Joseon regarded the Ming Empire as its ancestral homeland and considered the Qing dynasty barbaric, maintaining loyalty to the Ming even after its collapse. Due to their adherence to the China-centric perspective called Hwai-gwan, intellectuals in Joseon held profound disdain for the Qing dynasty.

 China [Ming Dynasty] is the mother and father of our country; thus, those barbarians [Qing Dynasty] are the enemy of our parents. As a civil servant, how can you abandon your parents and become the brother of your parents&#x27; enemy? The work [Ming&#x27;s help to Joseon] of the Imjinwaeran (Japanese invasion of Joseon, 1592) was thanks to the power of the [Ming] emperor. It is difficult to forget the grace of the emperor as long as our country lives and breathes. … we [Joseon Dynasty] shall not abandon our loyalty even if our country disappears (Injo of Joseon Citation 1636).

Joseon wanted to dispatch envoys as often as possible for economic and cultural interests as well as diplomatic purposes. China demanded that Joseon pay tribute only once in a three-year cycle. However, Joseon strongly opposed this measure and demanded that Joseon pay tribute to China three times a year. In response, China put pressure on them by banning envoy delegates from entering the country or demanding unreasonable tributes, but in the end Joseon, which had a theoretical advantage, got the privilege of paying tribute at least one or two times a year. Joseon enjoyed the most opportunities for tribute trade with China, and the tribute trade with China was considered as a privilege not easily granted in Asia. China had to give a higher value than the tribute it received to maintain face, and Joseon abused it. Joseon experienced numerous economic and cultural benefits through gifts from the imperial China. The purpose of the tribute varied depending on the circumstances, but it was usually for economic or diplomatic gain.

At the time of the 1882 Imo Incident, the Qing dynasty had a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policy toward Joseon; despite being a tributary state of China, Joseon was independent in its internal and external affairs, and China did not manipulate or interfere in them. After the Imo Incident, China abandoned its &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policy, signed the China–Korea Treaty of 1882, and became directly involved in the affairs of Joseon.

====Sino-Korean relationship after the Imo Incident====
After the Imo Incident in 1882, early reform efforts in Korea suffered a major setback. In the aftermath of the incident, the Chinese reasserted their influence over the peninsula, where they began to interfere in Korean internal affairs directly. After stationing troops at strategic points in the capital Seoul, the Chinese undertook several initiatives to gain significant influence over the Korean government. The Qing dispatched two special advisers on foreign affairs representing Chinese interests to Korea: the German Paul Georg von Möllendorff, a close confidant of Li Hongzhang, and the Chinese diplomat Ma Jianzhong. The Chinese supervised the creation of a Korean Maritime Customs Service headed by von Möllendorff. A staff of Chinese officers also took over the training of the army, providing the Koreans with 1,000 rifles, two cannons, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the (Capital Guards Command), a new Korean military formation, was created and trained along Chinese lines by Yuan Shikai.

In October 1882, the two countries signed the China–Korea Treaty of 1882, and Korea was reduced to a semi-colonial tributary state of China with King Gojong unable to appoint diplomats without Chinese approval, and with troops stationed in the country to protect Chinese interests. China&#x27;s new policy toward Joseon was set by Li Hongzhang and implemented by Yuan Shikai. According to Ming-te Lin: &quot;Li&#x27;s control of Korea from 1885 to 1894 through Yuan Shikai as resident official represented an anachronistic policy of intervention toward Korea.&quot;

===Gyorin===
This long-term, strategic policy contrasts with the &quot;gyorin&quot; (&quot;kyorin&quot;) (neighborly relations) diplomacy in dealings with Jurchens, Japan, Ryukyu Kingdom, Siam and Java. Gyorin was applied to a multi-national foreign policy. The unique nature of these bilateral diplomatic exchanges evolved from a conceptual framework developed by the Chinese. Gradually, the theoretical models would be modified, mirroring the evolution of a unique relationship.

====Japan====
As an initial step, a diplomatic mission was dispatched to Japan in 1402. The Joseon envoy sought to bring about the re-establishment of amicable relations between the two countries and he was charged to commemorate the good relations which existed in ancient times. This mission was successful, and &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this initial embassy. Not less than 70 diplomatic missions were dispatched from the Joseon capital to Japan before the beginning of Japan&#x27;s Edo period.

Reciprocal missions were construed as a means of communication between Korean kings and Japanese &quot;shōguns&quot; of almost equal ranking. The emperors of Japan at the time were figureheads with no actual political or military power, and the actual political and military rulers of Japan that Joseon communicated with were the shoguns who were represented as &quot;tycoon of Japan&quot; in many foreign communications to avoid the conflict with the Sinocentric system in which the emperor of China was the highest authority, and all rulers of tributary states were known as &quot;kings&quot;.

== Society ==


The exact population figures of Joseon-era Korea are disputed as government records of households are considered unreliable in this period. Between 1810 and 1850, the population declined approximately 10% and remained stable. Before the introduction of modern medicine by the Korean Empire government in the early 20th century, the average life expectancy for peasant and commoner Korean males was 24 years and for females 26 years, accounting for infant mortality.

Joseon Korea installed a centralised administrative system controlled by civil bureaucrats and military officers who were collectively called yangban. By the end of the 18th century, the yangban had acquired most of the traits of a hereditary nobility except that the status was based on a unique mixture of family position, gwageo examinations for Confucian learning, and a civil service system. The family of a yangban who did not succeed in becoming a government official for the third generation lost their yangban status and became commoners. For most part, the only way to become a government official was to pass a series of gwageo exams (one had to pass the &quot;lesser gwageo&quot; exam () in both of two stages to qualify for the greater gwageo exam, which again one had to pass in both of two stages to become a government official). The yangban and the king, in an uneasy balance, controlled the central government and military institutions. The proportion of yangban may have reached as high as 30% by 1800, due to the later practices of transaction of yangban status to peasants, although there was considerable local variation. As the government was small, a great many yangban were local gentry of high social status, but not always of high income.

Another portion of the population were slaves or serfs (&quot;nobi&quot;), &quot;low borns&quot; (&quot;cheonmin&quot;) or untouchable outcastes (&quot;baekjeong&quot;). Slavery in Korea was hereditary, as well as a form of legal punishment. The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen other than the ruling yangban class, and some possessed property rights, legal entities and civil rights. Hence, some scholars argue that it is inappropriate to call them &quot;slaves&quot;, while some scholars describe them as serfs. There were both government- and privately owned nobi, and the government occasionally gave them to yangban. Privately owned nobi could be inherited as personal property. During poor harvests, many sangmin people would voluntarily become nobi to survive. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. Joseon slaves could, and often did, own property. Private slaves could buy their freedom.
Many of the remaining 40–50% of the population were surely farmers, but recent work has raised important issues about the size of other groups: merchants and traders, local government or quasi-governmental clerks (&quot;Jungin&quot;), craftsmen and laborers, textile workers, etc. Given the size of the population, it may be that a typical person had more than one role. Most farming was, at any rate, commercial, not subsistence. In addition to generating additional income, a certain amount of occupational dexterity may have been required to avoid the worst effects of an often heavy and corrupt tax system.

Gender roles tightened during the Joseon period compared to the Goryeo era. The influence of Neo-Confucianism contributed to the increasingly male-dominated society of the time. Women were expected to be silent and not socialize with men who were not their relatives. They were required to be chaste to their husbands, and widows were not allowed to remarry. Any doubt of a woman&#x27;s chastity would bring dishonor to the family. To protect the family&#x27;s honor, young girls would carry a small knife (&quot;paedo&quot;), and with this they were expected to take their own lives if they were raped or even rumored to be caught in an affair. Laws were also enacted to prohibit women from riding horses or playing sports.

During the Late Joseon, the Confucian ideals of propriety and &quot;filial piety&quot; gradually came to be equated with a strict observance to a complex social hierarchy, with many fine gradations. By the early 18th century, the social critic Yi Chung-hwan (1690–1756) sarcastically complained that &quot;[W]ith so many different ranks and grades separating people from one another, people tend not to have a very large circle of friends.&quot; But, even as Yi wrote, the informal social distinctions of the Early Joseon were being reinforced by legal discrimination, such as Sumptuary law regulation of the dress of different social groups, and laws restricting inheritance and property ownership by women. Precisely because of the tenets of the Confucian &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, the adult male practice of Joseon Korea prescribed to keep both hair and beard, in contrast to the Japanese Tokugawa period.

Yet, these laws may have been announced precisely because social mobility was increasing, particularly during the prosperous century beginning about 1710. The original social hierarchy of the Joseon era was developed based on the social hierarchy of the Goryeo era. In the 14th–16th centuries, this hierarchy was strict and stable. Since economic opportunities to change status were limited, no law was needed.

In the late 17th to 19th centuries, new commercial groups emerged, and the old class system was extremely weakened. The situation was most marked in the Daegu region&#x27;s Yangban class, where they were expected to reach nearly 70% in 1858.

In 1801, government-owned slaves were all emancipated, and the institution gradually died out over the next century. By 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5 percent of the total population of Korea. The institution was completely abolished as part of a social plan in the Gabo Reform of 1894.
===Seonbis===

Seonbis () played a major role within political factions of the Joseon dynasty. Etymologically derived from a native Korean word meaning &quot;someone who is wise and knowledgeable,&quot; the word later became synonymous with the Chinese character 士 (shì), which meant &quot;scholar&quot; or &quot;retainer&quot;. As the Joseon dynasty encouraged the study of Confucianism, &quot;seonbis&quot; were interpreted as &quot;students who study Confucianism&quot; in Joseon-era Korean society.

&quot;Seonbis&quot; lived under strict, standardized Confucianist guidelines. Although they were encouraged to participate in politics and act as advisors to the King, many &quot;seonbis&quot; lived quiet lives in secluded regions, unaffiliated with any government office. These &quot;seonbis&quot; often organized scholarly communities which often imposed a huge influence over local regions. Those who became office-holders acted as aristocrats, boasting influence over Joseon politics.

&quot;Seonbis&quot; consistently used debate as a major decision-making method. Seonbis expressed their views on problems to be solved in front of the king and discussed the wrongdoings of the other faction&#x27;s argument. These political clashes often led to violence, such as the Korean literati purges.

Seonbis also participated in righteous armies during times of war, as archery was taught as a liberal arts subject for &quot;seonbis&quot;. Seonbis such as Gwak jae-u, Ko Kyung-myung, and Jo Heon led armies in battle. As &quot;seonbis&quot; also acted as village leaders, they often united local peasants and led armies into war.

== Culture ==
The Joseon dynasty presided over two periods of great cultural growth, during which Joseon culture created the first Korean tea ceremony, Korean gardens, and extensive historic works. The royal dynasty also built several fortresses and palaces.

Noble Korean women during this time were suppressed, along with shamans, in the 15th century because of Neo-Confucianist social norms when they previously led some of the least restricted lives out of anyone in Asia.

=== Clothing ===
During the Joseon period, jeogori of women&#x27;s hanbok became gradually tightened and shortened. In the 16th century, jeogori was baggy and reached below the waist, but by the 19th century, jeogori was shortened to the point that it did not cover the breasts, so another piece of cloth (&quot;heoritti&quot;) was used to cover them. At the end of the 19th century, Heungseon Daewongun introduced Magoja, a Manchu-style jacket, to Korea, which is often worn with hanbok to this day.

Chima was full-skirted and jeogori was short and tight in the late Joseon period. Fullness in the skirt was emphasized round the hips. Many undergarments were worn underneath chima such as darisokgot, soksokgot, dansokgot, and gojengi to achieve a desired silhouette. Because jeogori was so short it became natural to expose heoritti or &quot;heorimari&quot; which functioned like a corset. The white linen cloth exposed under jeogori in the picture is heoritti.

The upper classes wore hanbok of closely woven ramie cloth or other high-grade lightweight materials in warm weather and of plain and patterned silks the rest of the year. Commoners were restricted by law as well as resources to cotton at best. The upper classes wore a variety of colors, though bright colors were generally worn by children and girls and subdued colors by middle-aged men and women. Commoners were restricted by law to everyday clothes of white, but for special occasions they wore dull shades of pale pink, light green, gray, and charcoal. Formally, when Korean men went outdoors, they were required to wear overcoats known as &quot;durumagi&quot; which reach the knees.

=== Art ===

The Mid-Joseon period painting styles moved toward increased realism. A national painting style of landscapes called &quot;true view&quot; began – moving from the traditional Chinese style of idealized general landscapes to particular locations exactly rendered. While not photographic, the style was academic enough to become established and supported as a standardized style in Korean painting. At this time China ceased to have pre-eminent influence, Korean art took its own course, and became increasingly distinctive to the traditional Chinese painting.

Ceramics are a form of popular art during the Joseon period. Examples of ceramics include white porcelain or white porcelain decorated with cobalt, copper red underglaze, blue underglaze and iron underglaze. Ceramics from the Joseon period differ from other periods because artists felt that each piece of art deserved its own uniquely cultivated personality.

Beginning in the 10th century, white porcelain has been crafted in Korea. Historically overshadowed by the popularity of celadon, it was not until the 15th and 16th centuries that white porcelain, also known as baekje, was recognized for its artistic value. Among the most prized of Korean ceramics are large white jars. Their shape is symbolic of the moon and their color is associated with the ideals of purity and modesty of Confucianism. During this period, the bureau that oversaw the meals and court banquets of the royal family strictly controlled the production of white porcelain.

Blue and white porcelain artifacts decorating white porcelain with paintings and designs in underglaze by using natural cobalt pigment are another example of popular wares of the Joseon period. Many of these items were created by court painters employed by the royal family. During this period, the popular style of landscape paintings is mirrored in the decoration of ceramics. Initially developed by the Chinese at the Jingdezhen kilns in the mid-14th century, Joseon began to produce this type of porcelain from the 15th century under Chinese influence. The first cobalt imported from China was used by Korean artists. In 1463 when sources of cobalt were discovered in Korea, artists and their buyers found the material was inferior in quality and preferred the more expensive imported cobalt. Korean porcelain with imported cobalt decoration contradict the emphasis of an orderly, frugal and moderate life in Neo-Confucianism.

Strikingly different from cobalt, porcelain items with a copper-red underglaze are the most difficult to successfully craft. During production, these items require great skill and attention or will turn gray during the process of firing. While the birthplace of ceramics with copper red underglaze is widely disputed, these items originated during 12th century in Korea and became increasingly popular during the second half of the Joseon period. Some experts have pointed to the kilns of Bunwon-ri in Gwangju, a city that played a significant role in the production of ceramics during the Joseon period, as a possible birthplace.

Porcelain was also decorated with iron. These items commonly consisted of jars or other utilitarian pieces.

===Literature===
During the Joseon period, the yangban scholars and educated literati studied Confucian classics and Neo-Confucian literature.

The middle and upper classes of Joseon society were proficient in Classical Chinese. The Joseon official records (such as the &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Seungjeongwon ilgi&quot;) and the written works of the Yangban literati were written in Classical Chinese.

Newspapers like the &quot;Hwangsŏng Shinmun&quot; toward the end of the period were written in the Korean language using the Korean mixed script.

====&quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;====

The &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot; (also known as the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;) are the annual records of the Joseon dynasty, which were kept from 1413 to 1865. The annals, or &quot;sillok&quot;, consist of 1,893 volumes and are thought to cover the longest continual period of a single dynasty in the world. With the exception of two &quot;sillok&quot; compiled during the colonial era, the &quot;Annals&quot; are the 151st national treasure of Korea and listed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World registry.

====Uigwe====

&quot;Uigwe&quot; is a collection of royal protocols of the Joseon period, which records and prescribes through text and stylized illustration the important ceremonies and rites of the royal family.

===Education===

===Religion and philosophy===

The Joseon kingdom was noted for having Confucianism as its main philosophy, and also included some Buddhism. The study of literary exchanges between Confucian scholar officials and Buddhists shows that Buddhism was not cast out. There literary exchanges show a middle ground of both philosophies. &quot;scholar-officials – Some who in public castigated Buddhism as a heresy and deluded tradition, in private visited temples and associated closely with monks.&quot; This shows that while in public some scholars shamed Buddhists, their exchanges with Buddhists show that at the very least it was not cast outside of the kingdom.

One example of this is a famous Joseon scholar official Park Se-dang (박세당, 朴世堂, 1629–1703). He argues against Buddhism with the following, &quot;People say that Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu have harshly criticized Buddhism and therefore have only discussed what is aberrant and have not fully investigated what is profound. People say, their understanding is lacking and they have not fully examined it [its profoundness]. I, myself, don&#x27;t think that is the case… The heresies under heaven, they are also rather foul. Among them, Buddhism is the worst. If a person is inclined to Buddhism, then he is of the kind that pursues what is foul. Is it not clear that there is nothing further to discuss? It is like Mencius who [also felt no need to argue in detail when he] criticized Yang Zhu and Mozi. Surely, he did not argue further than to say Yang Zhu and Mozi did not respect their fathers and their emperors.&quot; He wrote a poem:

Buddhism was a part of the Joseon kingdom. While not supported publicly, privately it was very prevalent in Confucian-scholar officials. Many monarchs and members of the royal court also practiced or tolerated Buddhism among their family and court advisors and commissioned or were patrons of Buddhist art.

Pope Gregory XVI established an Apostolic Vicariate for the Kingdom of Korea on September 8, 1831, to provide for the spiritual care of Catholics in the kingdom and separating Korea from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Beijing.

=== Music ===
The &quot;Joseon&quot; period developed several musical forms. The form with the most extant pieces is &quot;sijo&quot; (). &quot;Sijo&quot; is a poetic form consisting of three lines, each with four feet, traditionally sung very slowly. In Korean verse, a foot is generally a short syntactic unit, such as a noun with an adjective or a verb with an adverb. For example:
==== Translation ====
&quot;Can tiny insects devour a whole great spreading pine?&quot;

&quot;Where is the long-billed woodpecker? Why is he not here?&quot;

&quot;When I hear the sound of falling trees, I cannot contain myself for sorrow.&quot;

Here, like other Korean musical forms, each foot can stand on its own. As &quot;sijo&quot; were sung in Korean, the pioneering of Hangul created the possibility for &quot;sijo&quot; to be written down without the use of substitutions such as Idu script. The first copy of &quot;sijo&quot; is of the &#x27;Twelve Songs of &quot;Dosan&quot;&#x27; by &quot;Yi Hwang&quot; written in 1565, which were written 100 years after the proclamation of Hangul. Additionally, the first anthology of &quot;sijo&quot; was compiled by &quot;Kim Cheontaek&quot; in 1728; before the anthology few &quot;sijo&quot; were written.

&quot;Kim Cheontaek&quot;&#x27;s anthology represents a change in the authorship of &quot;sijo&quot;. At first, &quot;sijo&quot; were primarily composed by the yangban aristocracy and entertainers of the Kisaeng class. By the mid-seventeenth century, the jungin or &quot;professional class&quot; were composing &quot;sijo&quot; as well. This also coincided with a new form of &quot;sijo&quot; called &quot;narrative &quot;sijo&quot;&quot; (), in which the first two lines were greatly lengthened. This expansion is likely a development from the so-called &quot;irregular &quot;sijo&quot;&quot; (), in which there was a minor lengthening of one of the first two lines. While there are very few remaining irregular &quot;sijo&quot;, and the form has not been revived, there is a sizable body of narrative &quot;sijo&quot; and the form continues to evolve.

&quot;Pansori&quot; () is another musical form that combines singing and prose to portray a story. Its development likely originates from shaman rituals and the songs within the Jeolla Province. It became a full-fledged musical form by the middle of the eighteenth century, and not long thereafter the yangban aristocracy also became interested in it. Originally there was a set of twelve stories that were sung, but only five were written down, and hence those five are the only ones sung today. Having been developed by commoners, &quot;p&#x27;ansori&quot; usually reflected their attitudes and aspirations, but by becoming popular with the &quot;yangban&quot;, &quot;p&#x27;ansori&quot; shifted somewhat toward &quot;yangban&quot; sensibilities and restrictions. &quot;P&#x27;ansori&quot; had a strong influence of the writing of the time, both because of the &quot;p&#x27;ansori&quot; novel (each based on one of the twelve stories) and by increasing the realism of the classical novel.

== Science and technology ==

=== 15th century ===
The Joseon period under the reign of Sejong the Great was Korea&#x27;s greatest period of scientific advancement. Under Sejong&#x27;s new policy, Cheonmin (low-status) people such as Jang Yeong-sil were allowed to work for the government. At a young age, Jang displayed talent as an inventor and engineer, creating machines to facilitate agricultural work. These included supervising the building of aqueducts and canals.

Some of his inventions were an automated (self-striking) water clock (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved model of the previous metal movable printing type created in the Goryeo period. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the sight glass, and the udometer.

The highpoint of Korean astronomy was during the Joseon period, where men such as Jang created devices such as celestial globes which indicated the positions of the sun, moon, and the stars. Later celestial globes (Gyupyo, 규표) were attuned to the seasonal variations.

The apex of astronomical and calendarial advances under King Sejong was the Chiljeongsan, which compiled computations of the courses of the seven heavenly objects (five visible planets, the sun, and moon),
developed in 1442. This work made it possible for scientists to calculate and accurately predict all the major heavenly phenomena, such as solar eclipses and other stellar movements. Honcheonsigye is an astronomical clock created by Song I-yeong in 1669. The clock has an armillary sphere with a diameter of 40 cm. The sphere is activated by a working clock mechanism, showing the position of celestial objects at any given time.

Gangnido, a Korean-made map of the world was created in 1402 by , , and . The map was created in the second year of the reign of Taejong of Joseon. The map was made by combining Chinese, Korean and Japanese maps.

=== 16th–19th century ===
The scientific and technological advance in the late Joseon period progressed slower than the early Joseon period.

16th-century court physician, Heo Jun wrote a number of medical texts, his most significant achievement being Dongui Bogam, which is often noted as the defining text of Traditional Korean medicine. The work spread to China and Japan, where it is still regarded as one of the classics of Oriental medicine today.

The first soft ballistic vest, myeonjebaegab, was invented in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the French campaign against Korea. Heungseon Daewongun ordered development of bulletproof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gi-du and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea (1871), when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests and took it to the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.

<doc id="324230" wikidata="Q1544903" url="?curid=324230" title="Sinking of SS Princess Alice">
<text>SS &quot;Princess Alice, formerlyPS &quot;Bute, was a British passenger paddle steamer that sank on 3 September 1878 after a collision with the collier on the River Thames. Between 600 and 700 people died, all from &quot;Princess Alice&quot;, the greatest loss of life of any British inland waterway shipping accident. No passenger list or headcount was made, so the exact figure of deaths has never been known.

Built in Greenock, Scotland, in 1865, &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was employed for two years in Scotland before being purchased by the Waterman&#x27;s Steam Packet Co to carry passengers on the Thames. By 1878 she was owned by the London Steamboat Co and was captained by William R. H. Grinstead; the ship carried passengers on a stopping service from Swan Pier, near London Bridge, downstream to Sheerness, Kent, and back. On her homeward journey, at an hour after sunset on 3 September 1878, she passed Tripcock Point and entered Gallions Reach. She took the wrong sailing line and was hit by &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;; the point of the collision was the area of the Thames where of London&#x27;s raw sewage had just been released. &quot;Princess Alice&quot; broke into three parts and sank quickly; her passengers drowned in the heavily polluted waters.

Grinstead died in the incident, so the subsequent investigations never established which course he thought he was supposed to take. The jury in the coroner&#x27;s inquest considered both vessels at fault, but more blame was put on &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;; the inquiry run by the Board of Trade found that &quot;Princess Alice&quot; had not followed the correct path and her captain was culpable. In the aftermath of the sinking, changes were made to the release and treatment of sewage, and how it was transported to, and released into, the sea. The Marine Police Force—the branch of the Metropolitan Police that had responsibility for policing the Thames—were provided with steam launches, after the rowing boats used up to that point had proved insufficient for the rescue. Five years after the collision &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; sank in the Bay of Biscay with the loss of all forty crew.

==Background==
===SS &quot;Princess Alice&quot;===

Caird &amp; Company of Greenock, Scotland, launched the passenger paddle steamer &quot;Bute&quot; on 29 March 1865. She entered service on 1 July 1865. The ship was long and at the beam, and measured 432 gross registered tons. &quot;Bute&quot; had been built for the Wemyss Bay Railway Company, for whom she carried passengers between Wemyss Bay and Rothesay. In 1867 she was sold to the Waterman&#x27;s Steam Packet Co. to travel on the River Thames; the company renamed the vessel &quot;Princess Alice&quot;, after Queen Victoria&#x27;s third child. In 1870 she was sold to the Woolwich Steam Packet Company and was operated as an excursion steamer; the company later changed its name to the London Steamboat Company. In 1873 the ship carried Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, the Shah of Persia, up the Thames to Greenwich, and became known to many locals as &quot;The Shah&#x27;s boat&quot;.

When &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was acquired by the Woolwich Steam Packet Company, the company made several alterations to the ship, including the installation of new boilers and making the five bulkheads watertight. The vessel had been inspected and was passed as safe by the Board of Trade. In 1878 another survey by the Board of Trade allowed the ship to carry a maximum of 936 passengers between London and Gravesend in calm water.

===SS &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;===
The collier was built in Newcastle in 1869 and was owned by Messrs Hall of Newcastle. Her gross registered tonnage was 1376, she was long and at the beam; her depth of hold was . The master was Captain Thomas Harrison.

==3 September 1878==

On 3 September 1878 &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was making what was billed as a &quot;Moonlight Trip&quot; from Swan Pier, near London Bridge, downstream to Sheerness, Kent, and back. During the journey she called at Blackwall, North Woolwich and Rosherville Gardens; many of the Londoners on board were travelling to Rosherville to visit the pleasure gardens that had been built 40 years before. As the London Steamboat Co. owned several ships, passengers could use their tickets interchangeably on the day, stopping off to travel on or back on different vessels if they wanted; for tickets from Swan Pier to Rosherville, the cost was two shillings.

&quot;Princess Alice&quot; left Rosherville at about 6:30 pm on her return to Swan Pier; she was carrying close to her full capacity of passengers, although no lists were kept, and the exact number of people on board is unknown. The master of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;, 47-year-old Captain William Grinstead, allowed his helmsman to stay at Gravesend, and replaced him with a seaman named John Eyers. Eyers had little experience of the Thames, or of helming a craft such as &quot;Princess Alice&quot;. Between 7:20 pm and 7:40 pm, &quot;Princess Alice&quot; had passed Tripcock Point, entered Gallions Reach and come within sight of the North Woolwich Pier—where many passengers were to disembark—when &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; was sighted. &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; usually carried coal to Africa, but had just been repainted at a dry dock. She was due to sail to Newcastle to pick up coal bound for Alexandria, Egypt. Harrison was unfamiliar with the conditions, so employed Christopher Dix, an experienced Thames river pilot, although he was not obliged to do so. As &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; had a raised forecastle, Dix did not have a clear view in front of him, so a seaman was placed on lookout.
On leaving Millwall, &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; proceeded down river at five knots; she kept roughly to the middle of the river, except where other craft were in her way. Approaching Gallions Reach, Dix saw &quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s red port light approaching on a course to pass starboard of them. Grinstead, travelling up the river against the tide, followed the normal watermen&#x27;s practice of seeking the slack water on the south side of the river. He altered the ship&#x27;s course, bringing her into the path of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;. Seeing the imminent collision, Grinstead shouted to the larger vessel &quot;Where are you coming to! Good God! Where are you coming to!&quot; Although Dix tried to manoeuvre his vessel out of a collision course, and ordered the engines to be put into &quot;reverse full speed&quot;, it was too late. &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was struck on the starboard side just in front of the paddle box at an angle of 13 degrees; she split in two and sank within four minutes—her boilers separating from the structure as it sank.

The crew of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; dropped ropes from their deck for the passengers of &quot;Princess Alice&quot; to climb; they also threw anything that would float into the water for people to hold. Other crew from &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; launched their lifeboat and rescued 14 people, and crews from boats moored nearby did the same. Residents from both banks of the Thames, particularly the boatmen of local factories, launched vessels to rescue who they could. Many of the passengers from &quot;Princess Alice&quot; were unable to swim; the long heavy dresses worn by women also hindered their efforts to stay afloat. &quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s sister ship, &quot;Duke of Teck&quot;, was steaming ten minutes behind her; she arrived too late to rescue anyone left in the water. Only two people who had been below decks or in the saloon survived the collision; a diver who examined the saloon reported that the passengers were jammed together in the doorways, mostly still upright.

About 130 people were rescued from the collision, but several died later from ingesting the water. &quot;Princess Alice&quot; sank at the point where London&#x27;s sewage pumping stations were sited. The twice-daily release of of raw sewage from the sewer outfalls Abbey Mills, at Barking, and the Crossness Pumping Station had occurred one hour before the collision. In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; shortly after the collision, a chemist described the outflow as:

Two continuous columns of decomposed fermenting sewage, hissing like soda-water with baneful gases, so black that the water is stained for miles and discharging a corrupt charnel-house odour, that will be remembered by all ... as being particularly depressing and sickening.
The water was also polluted by the untreated output from Beckton Gas Works, and several local chemical factories. Adding to the foulness of the water, a fire in Thames Street earlier that day had resulted in oil and petroleum entering the river.

&quot;Bywell Castle&quot; moored at Deptford to await the action of the authorities and the inquest. That night Harrison and Belding, the first mate, wrote the ship&#x27;s log to describe the event:

At 6:30 left the West Dock, Millwall, in charge of Mr Dicks, pilot; proceeding slowly, the master and pilot being on the upper bridge ... Light air and weather little hazy. At 7:45 pm proceeding at half speed down Gallions Reach. Being about centre of the Reach, observed an excursion steamer coming up Barking Reach, showing her red and masthead lights, when we ported our helm to keep over towards Tripcock Point. As the vessel neared, observed that the other steamer had ported, and immediately afterwards saw that she had starboarded and was trying to cross our bows, showing her green light close under the port bow. Seeing collision inevitable, stopped our engines and reversed full speed, when the two vessels collided, the bow of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; cutting into the other steamer, which was crowded with passengers, with a dreadful crash. Took immediate means for saving life by hauling up over the bows several men of the passengers, throwing rope&#x27;s-ends over all round the ship, throwing over four lifebuoys, a hold ladder and several planks, and getting out three boats, keeping the whistle blowing loudly all the time for assistance, which was rendered by several boats from shore and a boat from a passing steamer. The excursion steamer, which turned out to be &quot;Princess Alice&quot;, turning over and sinking under the bows. Succeeded in rescuing a great many passengers and anchored for the night. About 8:30 pm the steamer &quot;Duke of Teck&quot; came alongside and took off such passengers as had not been taken on shore in the boats.

==Aftermath==

=== Recovery of the dead ===

News of the sinking was telegraphed back to the centre of London, and soon filtered through to those waiting at Swan Pier for the steamer&#x27;s return. Relatives made their way to the London Steamboat offices near Blackfriars to wait for more news; many took the train from London Bridge to Woolwich. The crowds grew during the night and into the following day, as both relatives and sightseers travelled to Woolwich; additional police were drafted in to help control the crowds, and deal with the remains that were being landed. Reports came in of corpses being washed up as far upstream as Limehouse and down to Erith. When bodies were landed, they were stored locally for identification, rather than centrally, although most ended up at Woolwich Dockyard. Relatives had to travel between several locations on both sides of the Thames to search for missing family members. Local watermen were hired for £2 a day to search for bodies; they were paid a minimum of five shillings for each one they recovered, which sometimes led to fights over the corpses. One of those picked up was that of Grinstead, &quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s captain.

Because of the pollution from the sewage and local industrial output, the bodies from the Thames were covered with slime, which was found difficult to clean off; the corpses began to rot at a faster pace than normal, and many of the corpses were unusually bloated. Victims&#x27; clothing also began to rot quickly and was discoloured after immersion in the polluted water. Sixteen of those who survived died within two weeks, and several others were ill.

=== Inquest ===
On 4 September Charles Carttar, the coroner for West Kent, opened the inquest for his region. That day he took the jury to view the corpses at the Woolwich Town Hall and Woolwich Pier. There were more bodies on the northern bank, but this lay outside his jurisdiction. Charles Lewis, the coroner for South Essex, visited the Board of Trade and the Home Office to try to have the remains in his jurisdiction moved to Woolwich to allow one inquest that could cover all the victims and hear the evidence in only one location, but the law meant that the dead could not be moved until the inquest had been opened and adjourned. Instead, he opened his inquest to formally identify the bodies under his authority, then adjourned proceedings until after Carttar&#x27;s case had come to a conclusion. He issued burial orders, and the remains were then transferred to Woolwich.
During low tide, part of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s rail could be seen above the waterline. Plans to raise the ship began on 5 September with a diver examining the wreckage. He found the vessel had broken into three sections—the fore, aft and boilers. He reported back that there were still several bodies on board. Work began the following day to raise the larger fore section, which was long. This was beached at low tide—2:00 am on 7 September—at Woolwich; while she was being pulled ashore, &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; steamed past, leaving London, but without her captain, who remained. The following day large crowds visited Woolwich again to view the raised section of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;. Fights broke out in places for the best vantage point, and people rowed up to the wreck to break off souvenirs. An additional 250 policemen were drafted in to help control the crowds. That evening, after most of the crowd had gone home, the aft section of the ship was raised and beached next to the bow.
Because of the accelerated rate of decomposition of many of the corpses, the burials of many of those still unidentified took place on 9 September at Woolwich cemetery in a mass grave; several thousand people were in attendance. The coffins all carried a police identification number, which was also attached to the clothing and personal items which were retained to aid later identification. The same day over 150 private funerals of victims took place.

The first two weeks of Carttar&#x27;s inquest were given over to the formal identification of the bodies, and visits to the wreck site to examine the remains of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;. From 16 September the proceedings began to examine the causes of the collision. Carttar began by bemoaning the media coverage of the event, which suggested strongly that &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; had been in error and should take the blame. He focused his proceedings on William Beechey, the first body to have been positively identified; Carttar explained to the jury that whatever verdict they reached on Beechey would apply to the other victims. Numerous Thames boatmen appeared as witnesses, all of whom had been active in the area at the time; their stories of the path taken by &quot;Princess Alice&quot; differed considerably. Most pleasure craft coming upriver on the Thames would round Tripcock Point and head for the northern bank to take advantage of more favourable currents. Had &quot;Princess Alice&quot; done that, &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; would have gone clearly astern of her. Several witnesses stated that once &quot;Princess Alice&quot; rounded Tripcock Point she had been pushed into the centre of the river by currents; the ship then attempted to turn to port, which would have kept her close to the river&#x27;s southern bank, but in doing so cut across the bows of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;. Several masters of other ships moored nearby who witnessed the collision agreed with this series of events. &quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s chief mate denied that his ship had changed direction.

During the inquest evidence was taken from George Purcell, the stoker on &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;, who, on the night of the sinking, had told several people that the captain and crew of the ship were drunk. Under oath he changed his claims, and stated that they were sober, and that he had no recollection of claiming that anyone was drunk. Evidence given by other members of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;″s crew showed it had been Purcell who had been drunk; one crewman said that &quot;Purcell was like the generality of firemen. He was rather the worse for drink, but not so bad that he could not take his watch&quot;. Evidence was also taken concerning the state of the Thames at the point the ship sank, and of the construction and stability of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;. On 14 November, after twelve hours of discussion, the inquest released its verdict; four members of the nineteen-member jury refused to sign the statement. The verdict was:
That the death of the said William Beachey and others was occasioned by drowning in the waters of the River Thames from a collision that occurred after sunset between a steam vessel called the &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; and a steam vessel called the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; whereby the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was cut in two and sunk, such collision not being wilful; that the &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; did not take the necessary precaution of easing, stopping and reversing her engines in time and that the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; contributed to the collision by not stopping and going astern; that all collisions in the opinion of the jury might in future be avoided if proper and stringent rules and regulations were laid down for all steam navigation on the River Thames.
Addenda:
# We consider that the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was, on the third of September, seaworthy.
# We think the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was not properly and sufficiently manned.
# We think the number of persons onboard the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; was more than prudent.
# We think the means of saving life onboard the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; were insufficient for a vessel of her class.

=== Board of Trade inquiry ===
Running at the same time as the coroner&#x27;s inquest was a Board of Trade inquiry. Specific charges were laid against Captain Harrison, two of the crew members of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;, and against Long, the first mate of &quot;Princess Alice&quot;; all had their licences suspended at the start of the hearing. The Board of Trade proceedings began on 14 October 1878 and continued until 6 November. The board found that &quot;Princess Alice&quot; had breached Rule 29, Section (d) of the Board of Trade Regulations and the Regulations of the Thames Conservancy Board, 1872. This stated that if two ships are heading towards each other, they should pass on the port side of each other. As &quot;Princess Alice&quot; had not followed this procedure, the Board found &quot;Princess Alice&quot; to blame and that &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; could not avoid the collision.
The company that owned &quot;Princess Alice&quot; sued the owners of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; for £20,000 compensation; the owners of &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; counter-sued for £2,000. The case was heard in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice in late 1878. After two weeks, the judgment was that both vessels were to blame for the collision.

As no passenger list was kept on &quot;Princess Alice&quot;—or a record of the number of people on board—it was not possible to determine precisely the number of people who died: figures vary from 600 to 700. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that &quot;the coroner believes that there are from 60 to 80 bodies unrecovered from the river. The total number of lives lost must thus have been from 630 to 650&quot;. Michael Foley, in his examination of disasters on the Thames, observes that &quot;there was no proof of the final death toll. However, around 640 bodies were eventually recovered&quot;. The sinking was the worst inland disaster on water in the UK.

A Mansion House fund for the victims had been opened by the Lord Mayor of London in the aftermath of the sinking; by the time it closed it had raised £35,000, which was distributed among the victims&#x27; families.

==Consequences and later events==

During the 1880s London&#x27;s Metropolitan Board of Works began to purify the sewage at Crossness and Beckton, rather than dumping the untreated waste into the river, and a series of six sludge boats were ordered to ship effluent into the North Sea for dumping. The first boat commissioned in June 1887 was named &quot;Bazalgette&quot;—after Joseph Bazalgette, who had rebuilt London&#x27;s sewer system. The practice of dumping at sea continued until December 1998.

Until &quot;Princess Alice&quot; sank, the Marine Police Force—the branch of the Metropolitan Police that had responsibility for policing the Thames—relied on rowing boats for their work. The inquest into the sinking of &quot;Princess Alice&quot; found that these were insufficient for the requirements of the role, and that they should be replaced by steam launches. The first two launches entered service in the mid-1880s; eight were working by 1898. The Royal Albert Dock, which opened in 1880, helped to separate heavy goods traffic from smaller boats; this and global adoption of emergency signalling lights on boats both helped avoid future tragedies.

After 23,000 people donated to a sixpenny fund, a memorial Celtic cross was erected in Woolwich Cemetery in May 1880. St Mary Magdalene Woolwich, the local parish church, also later installed a stained-glass memorial window. In 2008 a National Lottery grant funded the installation of a memorial plaque at Barking Creek to mark the 130th anniversary of the sinking.

&quot;Princess Alice&quot;″s owner, the London Steamboat Co, purchased the wreck of the vessel from the Thames Conservancy for £350; the engines were salvaged and the remainder sent to a ship breaker. The London Steamboat Co was bankrupt within six years, and its successor went into financial difficulties three years after that. According to the historian Jerry White, along with competition from the railways and bus services, the sinking of &quot;Princess Alice&quot; &quot;had some impact ... in blighting the tidal Thames as a pleasure-ground&quot;. &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; was reported missing on 29 January 1883 sailing between Alexandria and Hull; it carried a cargo of cottonseed and beans. In February 1883 newspapers carried a final report:

It is believed that the steamer &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;, which ran down the saloon boat &quot;Princess Alice&quot;, off Woolwich, some years ago, has been lost in the Bay of Biscay, in the gale which proved fatal to the &quot;Kenmure Castle&quot;. The &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; carried a crew of 40 men and her cargo consisted of Egyptian produce.

<doc id="324233" wikidata="Q12981878" url="?curid=324233" title="Wollemia">
<text>Wollemia is a genus of coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae, endemic to Australia. It represents only one of three living genera in the family, alongside &quot;Araucaria&quot; and &quot;Agathis&quot; (being more closely related to the latter). The genus has only a single known species, Wollemia nobilis, commonly known as the Wollemi Pine (though it is not a true pine) which was discovered in 1994 in a temperate rainforest wilderness area of the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales. It was growing in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided, sandstone gorges north-west of Sydney. The genus is named after the National Park. 

The Wollemi pine is classified as critically endangered (CR) on the IUCN&#x27;s Red List, and is legally protected in Australia. After it was discovered that the trees could be successfully cloned, new trees were potted up in the Botanic Gardens of Sydney and Mount Annan and planted as far away as the Humboldt Botanical Garden near Eureka, California.

A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population. The overall objective is to ensure that the species remains viable in the long term. Australian prime ministers and foreign affairs ministers have presented Wollemi pines to various dignitaries around the world.

Although often described as a &quot;living fossil&quot;, there are no unambiguous fossils of &quot;Wollemia&quot; and potential fossil records of it have been considered uncertain.

== Description ==

&quot;Wollemia nobilis&quot; is an evergreen tree reaching tall. The bark is very distinctive, dark brown, and knobbly, quoted as resembling the breakfast cereal Coco Pops. The tree coppices readily, and most specimens are multiple-trunked or appear as clumps of trunks thought to derive from old coppice growth, with some consisting of up to 100 stems of differing sizes. The branching is unusual in that nearly all the side branches never have further branching. After a few years, each branch either terminates in a cone (either male or female) or ceases growth. After this, or when the cone becomes mature, the branch dies. New branches then arise from dormant buds on the main trunk. Rarely, a side branch will turn erect and develop into a secondary trunk, which then bears a new set of side branches.

The leaves are flat linear, long and broad. They are arranged spirally on the shoot but twisted at the base to appear in two or four flattened ranks. As the leaves mature, they develop from bright lime-green to a more yellowish-green. The seed cones are green, long and in diameter, and mature about 18–20 months after wind pollination. They disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds which are small and brown, thin and papery with a wing around the edge to aid wind-dispersal. The male (pollen) cones are slender conic, long and broad and reddish-brown in colour and are lower on the tree than the seed cones. Seedlings appear to be slow-growing and mature trees are extremely long-lived; some of the older individuals today are estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 years old.
== History ==
=== Discovery ===
The discovery, on or about 10 September 1994, by David Noble, Michael Casteleyn, and Tony Zimmerman, occurred only because the group had been systematically exploring the area, looking for new canyons. Noble had good botanical knowledge, and quickly recognised the trees as unusual because of the unique bark, and worthy of further investigation.

He took specimens to work for identification, expecting someone to be able to identify the plants.
His specimens were identified by Wyn Jones, a botanist with National Parks and Jan Allen from the Botanical Gardens. After the identification was made, National Parks then went under a veil of secrecy, with the discoverers not learning the full magnitude of their discovery for about six months. National Parks came close to damaging the stand when a helicopter used to collect cones inadvertently pruned one of the pines with its rotor. The species was subsequently named after David Noble.

The first illustrations of the Wollemi Pine were drawn by David Mackay, a botanical artist and scientific illustrator who was working at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney when the species was discovered.

Further study would be needed to establish its relationship to other conifers. The initial suspicion was that it had certain characteristics of the 200 million year-old family Araucariaceae, but was not similar to any living species in the family. Comparison with living and fossilised Araucariaceae proved that it was a member of that family, and it has been placed into a new genus, beside the genera &quot;Agathis&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot;.

Fewer than 60 adult trees are known to be growing wild in four locations, not far apart. It is very difficult to count individuals, as most trees are multi-stemmed and may have a connected root system. Genetic testing has revealed that all the specimens are genetically indistinguishable, suggesting that the species has been through a genetic bottleneck 10,000–26,000 years ago, in which its population became so low (possibly just one or two individuals) that all genetic variability was lost.

=== Conservation ===

==== Threats ====
In November 2005, wild-growing trees were found to be infected with &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;. New South Wales park rangers believe the virulent water mould was introduced by unauthorised visitors to the site, the location of which is still undisclosed to the public.

The grove of Wollemia trees was endangered by fire during the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season. They were saved by specialist firefighters from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, supported by the Rural Fire Service who installed an irrigation system as well as dropping retardant.

=== Global involvement in conservation ===

&quot;Home gardeners become accidental citizen scientists for Wollemi Pine&quot; was the headline of a 2023 news article reporting results of an unusual conservation strategy underway since 2005. Ten years after safeguarding of rooted branch cuttings had been initiated in botanic gardens around the world, commercial growers were authorized to receive surplus cuttings to propagate for sales to their own customers. This unusual management decision for an endangered plant owed to the &quot;huge public interest in this rare tree&quot; and as an experiment to test whether commercial availability would serve &quot;to protect wild populations from illegal collecting.&quot;

Results were tallied from more than 1,500 people from 31 countries who were growing the cuttings and responded to an online survey created by two plant scientists in Australia. Results indicated that the species grows well where climate is temperate and there is adequate year-round rainfall. Loamy soils with good drainage proved to be ideal. The team concluded, &quot;This study demonstrates that it is feasible to establish Wollemi pines in many parts of the world and under different climates and cultural regimes, which can help conserve this species in the face of climate change and other threats.&quot;

== Cultivation and uses ==

A propagation programme made Wollemi pine specimens available to botanical gardens, first in Australia in 2006 and subsequently throughout the world. It may prove to be a valuable tree for ornament, either planted in open ground or for tubs and planters. In Australia, potted native Wollemi pines have been promoted as a Christmas tree. It is also proving to be more adaptable and cold-hardy than its restricted temperate-subtropical, humid distribution would suggest, tolerating temperatures between , with reports, from Japan and the USA, that it can survive down to . A grove of Wollemi pines planted in Inverewe Garden, Scotland, believed to be the most northerly location of any successful planting, have survived temperatures of , recorded in January 2010. It also handles both full sun and full shade. Like many other Australian trees, &quot;Wollemia&quot; is susceptible to the pathogenic water mould &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, so this may limit its potential as a timber tree.

The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have published information on how to grow Wollemi pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.

Examples of the species can be viewed at The Tasmanian Arboretum and at Giardini di Villa della Pergola in Alassio, Italy.

=== Care ===
The Wollemi pine is extremely hardy and versatile in cultivation. Despite it being an endangered species, it is easy to grow and requires relatively low maintenance. It will adapt to a diverse range of climatic zones, thriving in full sun to semi shaded outdoor positions. They can be maintained in a pot almost indefinitely, and make good container plants for patios, verandas, and courtyards. Because it tolerates air conditioning, it can also be used as an indoor decorative plant. They require well-drained soil and protection from frost.

=== Pruning ===
When pruning the Wollemi pine, use sterile secateurs at any time of year to retain its compact form. It can be pruned heavily with up to two thirds of the plant size removed. Pruning heavily can be done on the apical growth and the branches. The best time to prune is during the winter months.

=== Growth rate ===
The Wollemi pine has very controlled growth, especially if it is kept in a pot. It may take up to 25 years to reach in height.

== Phylogeny ==
The genus &quot;Wollemia&quot; shares morphological characteristics with the genera &quot;Araucaria&quot; and &quot;Agathis&quot;. &quot;Wollemia&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot; both have closely crowded sessile and amphistomatic (producing stomata on both sides of the leaf) leaves, and aristate bract scales, while &quot;Wollemia&quot; and &quot;Agathis&quot; both have fully fused bracts, ovuliferous scales, and winged seeds. Scrutiny of the fossil record likewise does not clarify &quot;Wollemia&quot; relationship to &quot;Araucaria&quot; or &quot;Agathis&quot;, since the former has similarly disparate leaf characters in its adult and juvenile forms, and the latter has similar cone characters. Further, the recent description of several extinct genera within the Araucariaceae points to complex relationships within the family and a significant loss of diversity since the Cretaceous. An early study of the rbcL gene sequence places &quot;Wollemia&quot; in the basal position of the Araucariaceae and as the sister group to &quot;Agathis&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot;. In contrast, another study of the rbcL sequence shows that &quot;Wollemia&quot; is the sister group to &quot;Agathis&quot;, and &quot;Araucaria&quot; is basal. The different outgroup selection and genes used in previous studies are the reasons behind the discrepancy over the groupings of the three genera. Later genetic studies corroborate &quot;Wollemia&quot;&#x27;s placement in the Araucariaceae as sister to &quot;Agathis&quot; based on data from the 28s rRNA gene, a combination of rbcL and matK genes, and a comprehensive study encompassing nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S rRNA, chloroplast 16S rRNA, rbcL, matK and rps4, and mitochondrial coxl and atp1 genes.

Below is the phylogeny of the Araucariaceae based on the consensus from the most recent cladistic analysis of molecular data. It shows the relative positions of &quot;Wollemia&quot;, &quot;Agathis&quot;, and &quot;Araucaria&quot; within the division.
=== Potential fossil record ===
There are no fossils that can be assigned definitively to &quot;Wollemia. Araucarioides&quot; leaves possibly representing &quot;Wollemia&quot; or a close relative have been reported from the Early Eocene of Tasmania. Some authors have suggested that the fossil pollen genus &quot;Dilwynites&quot;, known from the Late Cretaceous-Pliocene of Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia and Antarctica is assignable to &quot;Wollemia&quot;, however, the pollen of &quot;Wollemia&quot; is highly variable, and its similarity to &quot;Dilwynites&quot; has been questioned, with &quot;Dilwynites&quot; also closely resembling the pollen of some species of &quot;Agathis&quot;. It is therefore possible that &quot;Dilwynites&quot; pollen represents that of other araucarian conifers as well as possibly also &quot;Wollemia&quot;.

<text>The King of Hungary () was the ruling head of state of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1000 (or 1001) to 1918. The style of title &quot;Apostolic King of Hungary&quot; (&quot;apostoli magyar király&quot;) was endorsed by Pope Clement XIII in 1758 and used afterwards by all monarchs of Hungary.

==Establishment of the title==
Before 1000 AD, Hungary was not yet recognized as a kingdom by the Pope and the ruler of Hungary was styled Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The first King of Hungary, Stephen I. was crowned on 25 December 1000 (or 1 January 1001) with the crown Pope Sylvester II had sent him and with the consent of Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor.

Following King Stephen I&#x27;s coronation, all the monarchs of Hungary and the Árpád dynasty used the title &quot;King&quot;. However, not all rulers of Hungary were kings—for example, Stephen Bocskai and Francis II Rákóczi were proclaimed rulers as &quot;High Princes of Hungary&quot;, and there were also three Governors of Hungary who were sometimes styled &quot;regents&quot;, János Hunyadi, Lajos Kossuth and Miklós Horthy.

===Legal requirements for a coronation to be legitimate===

From the 13th century on, a process was established to confirm the legitimacy of the King. No person could become the legitimate King of Hungary without fulfilling the following criteria:
* Coronation by the Archbishop of Esztergom
* Coronation with the Holy Crown of Hungary
* Coronation at Székesfehérvár Basilica
This meant a certain level of protection to the integrity of the Kingdom. For example, stealing the Holy Crown of Hungary was no longer enough to become legitimate King.

The first requirement (coronation by the Archbishop of Esztergom) was confirmed by Béla III, who had been crowned by Archbishop Berthold of Kalocsa, based on the special authorisation of Pope Alexander III. After his coronation he declared that this coronation would not affect the customary claim of the Archbishop of Esztergom to crown the king. In 1211, Pope Innocent III refused to confirm the agreement of Archbishop John of Esztergom and Archbishop Berthold of Kalocsa on the transfer of the claim, and he declared that only the Archbishop of Esztergom was entitled to crown the King of Hungary.

King Charles I of Hungary was crowned in May 1301 with a provisional crown in Esztergom by the Archbishop of that city; this led to his second coronation in June 1309. At that time the Holy Crown was not used, and he was crowned in Buda by the Archbishop of Esztergom. However, his final third coronation was in 1310, in Székesfehérvár, with the Holy Crown and by the Archbishop of Esztergom. Then the King&#x27;s coronation was considered absolutely legitimate.

On the other hand, in 1439, the dowager queen Elizabeth of Luxemburg ordered one of her handmaidens to steal the Holy Crown from the palace of Visegrád, and then promoted the coronation of her newborn son Ladislaus V, which was carried out legitimately in Székesfehérvár by the Archbishop of Esztergom.

A similar situation occurred with Matthias Corvinus, when he negotiated for return of the Holy Crown, which was in the possession of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. After it was returned, Matthias was legitimately crowned.

===Inheriting the throne===

As in all the traditional monarchies, the heir descended through the male line from a previous King of Hungary. In accordance with Hungarian tradition, this right usually passed to younger brothers, before passing to the son of the previous King, which caused family disputes on many occasions. The founder of the first Hungarian royal house was Árpád, who led his people into the Carpathian Basin in 895. His descendants, who ruled for more than 400 years, included Saint Stephen I, Saint Ladislaus I, Andrew II, and Béla IV. In 1301 the last member of the House of Árpád died, and Charles I was crowned, claiming the throne in the name of his paternal grandmother Mary, the daughter of Stephen V. With the death of Mary, the granddaughter of Charles I, in 1395, the direct line was interrupted again, and Mary&#x27;s husband Sigismund continued reigning, after being elected by the nobility of the Kingdom in the name of the Holy Crown.

Later, Matthias Corvinus was elected by the nobles of the Kingdom, being the first Hungarian monarch who descended from an aristocratic family, and not from a royal family that inherited the title. The same happened decades later with John Zápolya, who was elected in 1526 after the death of Louis II in the battle of Mohács.

After this, the House of Habsburg inherited the throne, and ruled Hungary from Austria for almost 400 years until 1918. Admiral Horthy was appointed regent in 1920, but Charles IV of Hungary&#x27;s attempts to retake the throne were unsuccessful. The monarchy of Hungary was formally abolished on 1 February 1946 on the establishment of the Second Hungarian Republic.

==Other titles used by the King of Hungary==

Over the centuries, the Kings of Hungary acquired or claimed the crowns of several neighboring countries, and they began to use the royal titles connected to those countries. By the time of the last kings, their precise style was: &quot;By the Grace of God, Apostolic King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania and Bulgaria, Grand Prince of Transylvania, Count of the Székelys&quot;.

The title &quot;Apostolic King&quot; was confirmed by Pope Clement XIII in 1758 and used thereafter by all the Kings of Hungary.

The title of &quot;King of Slavonia&quot; referred to the territories between the Drava and the Sava Rivers. That title was first used by Ladislaus I. It was also Ladislaus I who adopted the title &quot;King of Croatia&quot; in 1091. Coloman added the phrase &quot;King of Dalmatia&quot; to the royal style in 1105.

The title &quot;King of Rama&quot;, referring to the claim to Bosnia, was first used by Béla II in 1136. It was Emeric who adopted the title &quot;King of Serbia&quot;. The phrase &quot;King of Galicia&quot; was used to indicate the supremacy over Halych, while the title &quot;King of Lodomeria&quot; referred to Volhynia; both titles were adopted by Andrew II in 1205. In 1233, Béla IV began to use the title &quot;King of Cumania&quot; which expressed the rule over the territories settled by the Cumans (i.e., Wallachia and Moldavia) at that time. The phrase &quot;King of Bulgaria&quot; was added to the royal style by Stephen V.

Transylvania was originally a part of the Kingdom of Hungary ruled by a voivode, but after 1526 became a semi-independent principality vassal to the Ottoman Empire, and later to the Habsburg monarchy. In 1696, after dethroning Prince Michael II Apafi, Leopold I took the title &quot;Prince of Transylvania&quot;. In 1765, Maria Theresa elevated Transylvania to the status of Grand Principality.

The &quot;Count of the Székelys&quot; was originally a dignitary of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the title was later used by the Princes of Transylvania. The title was revived during the reign of Maria Theresa who adopted it at the request of the Székelys.

<text>Fame was a Swedish musical duo consisting of Jessica Andersson (born 27 October 1973 in Stockholm) and Magnus Bäcklund (born 16 November 1965 in Kristinehamn, Värmland County). They met each other at the televised arts school and contest &quot;Fame Factory&quot;, which aired in autumn 2002. Bäcklund was the overall winner, while Andersson dropped out to give birth to her son Liam. Bäcklund also has two young twin daughters at home. Andersson is a former photo model and Bäcklund is a commercial pilot.

==Melodifestivalen==
In 2003, Fame won the favour of the Swedish public and the jury with the song &quot;Give Me Your Love&quot; in a landslide victory in Melodifestivalen 2003 at the Stockholm Globe Arena. Fame won with 240 points, overtaking such former Melodifestivalen winners as Jan Johansen, Jill Johnson and Afro-Dite, as well as the famous Swedish pop group Alcazar. They went on to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest, eventually garnering 107 points, which put them in fifth place.

In 2004, they participated in Melodifestivalen again and reached sixth place with the song &quot;Vindarna vänder oss&quot; (&quot;The Winds Turn Us&quot;).

==After break up==

*Magnus Bäcklund 
Magnus Bäcklund went on to take part in Melodifestivalen 2006 with the song &quot;The Name of Love&quot;. He took part in the first semifinal and made it to the &quot;Andra Chansen&quot; (second chance) round. From there he reached the final, where he finished 5th. Jessica Andersson also entered with the song &quot;Kalla nätter&quot; (&quot;Cold Nights&quot;), but came in fifth in her semifinal round, which eliminated her from the competition.

*Jessica Andersson
Jessica Andersson took part in Melodifestivalen six times with &quot;Kalla nätter&quot; in 2006, &quot;Kom&quot; in 2007, &quot;I Did It for Love&quot; in 2010, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hurt Me Now&quot; in 2015, &quot;Party Voice&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Horizon&quot; in 2021, but without winning the competition. She also released two solo albums: &quot;Wake Up&quot; in 2009 and &quot;40.14.4&quot; in 2013.

<text>F.L.Y. was a Latvian band created to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest.

At a party following the national finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, Mārtiņš Freimanis came up with an idea for the following year’s contest.
In the autumn of 2002, during a golf tournament hosted by Latvijas Televīzija, Mārtiņš Freimanis, Lauris Reiniks and Yana Kay, started discussing such a co-operative venture and so the trio F.L.Y. was born. Their song &quot;Hello from Mars&quot; was written by Mārtiņš Freimanis and Lauris Reiniks and recorded soon after.

Each member of F.L.Y. had further careers. Yana Kay and Lauris Reiniks each released an album, whilst Mārtiņš Freimanis was the lead singer of the band Tumsa, which has three albums to its credit.

Yana Kay, Lauris Reiniks and Mārtiņš Freimanis have all participated separately in the national finals of the Eurovision Song Contest preliminaries, but their big break – the chance to represent Latvia at the Eurovision international finals – came in year 2003, when they participated as a group.

After spending time together promoting their Eurovision Song Contest entry, F.L.Y. started jamming and creating new songs. As a result an album was made and released in Latvia at the beginning of May 2003. They represented Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 and got 24th place.

The band broke up in 2005.

On 27 January 2011, Mārtiņš Freimanis died in a hospital in Riga of complications from an influenza A infection.

<doc id="324245" wikidata="Q1813750" url="?curid=324245" title="Hurricane Opal">
<text>Hurricane Opal was a large and powerful tropical cyclone that caused severe and extensive damage along the northern Gulf Coast of the United States in October 1995. The fifteenth named storm, ninth hurricane and strongest tropical cyclone of the unusually active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Opal developed from the interaction of a tropical wave and a low-pressure area near the Yucatán Peninsula on September 27 as Tropical Depression Seventeen. The depression crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and intensified into a tropical storm on September 30. Opal intensified into a hurricane on October 2 after entering the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone turned northeastward and strengthened significantly. By October 4, Opal was an intense , Category 4 hurricane. With a minimum pressure of , Hurricane Opal was the most intense category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record. However, the cyclone abruptly weakened to a low-end Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall on the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola later that day. The storm quickly unraveled as it moved inland and became extratropical on October 5. The remnants of Opal moved northward and dissipated over Ontario the following day.

The precursor and initial stages of Opal brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Guatemala and Mexico. In the former, flooding and landslides left about 34,000 people homeless and damage to infrastructure and agriculture. A total of 31 deaths occurred in Guatemala. In Mexico, a number of rivers overflowed in the states of Campeche and Tabasco, forcing more than 42,000 people to evacuate. The storm left hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to agriculture in Campeche alone. Nineteen people were killed in the country. In Florida, high winds and storm surge left extensive damage in the panhandle. The majority of structures were swept away or experienced some degree of damage, particularly from Wakulla County westward. In Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Bay counties, nearly 300 homes were destroyed and 1,000 others suffered major damage. The storm left at least $2.1 billion in damage in Florida alone. Several other states were impacted by the storm, especially Alabama, where the storm spawned many tornadoes and strong winds downed numerous trees and left about 2.6 million people without electricity. A total of 27 deaths were attributed to Opal in the United States. The hurricane overall left about $4.7 billion in damage, much of which took place in the US. Due to its destructive effects, the name &quot;Opal&quot; was retired in the spring of 1996 and replaced with &quot;Olga&quot; for the 2001 season.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Hurricane Opal were linked using satellite imagery and synoptic analyses to a tropical wave that left the western coast of Africa on September 11. Ten days later, the disturbance reached the Lesser Antilles after crossing the tropical Atlantic. Continuing westward, the disturbance showed little signs of organization before entering the western Caribbean Sea on September 23. There, the wave became entangled with a broad area of low-pressure east of Nicaragua, and the combined system drifted west-northwestward toward the Yucatán Peninsula; but even then, the disturbance lacked significant development. However, a burst of thunderstorm activity occurred near the storm&#x27;s center on September 27, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to declare the system a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC that day. At the time, the depression was centered south-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico.
The primordial depression meandered across the Yucatán Peninsula during the three days following tropical cyclogenesis due to the lack of dominant steering currents. Despite remaining over land for an extended period, the depression developed organized rainbands, and ships in the region reported weather conditions that were suggestive of a stronger system. As a result, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 12:00 UTC on September 30 while the storm was over the north-central coast of Yucatán; this classification resulted in the tropical cyclone being named &quot;Opal&quot;, which also made it the first Atlantic storm to be given a name starting with the letter O. Over the next two days, Opal entered the Gulf of Mexico before tracking slowly west-southwestward into the Bay of Campeche. There, the storm strengthened into a hurricane at 12:00 UTC on October 2. Shortly afterward, a primitive eye began to form. At the same time, a strong trough tracking across the United States caused Opal to slowly turn northeastward.

After clearing the Bay of Campeche, Opal accelerated towards the United States Gulf Coast. The combination of warm sea surface temperatures associated with an unusually warm pocket of ocean waters and an upper-level high pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a highly conducive environment for intensification. After a significant reorganization in Opal&#x27;s internal structure, the hurricane was able to rapidly intensify in these favorable conditions. At 12:00 UTC on October 4, Opal reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of , making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a minimum barometric pressure of 916 hPa (27.05 inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. The tropical cyclone&#x27;s eye measured at peak intensity as the storm was beginning an eyewall replacement cycle. The progression of this cycle resulted in Opal&#x27;s gradual weakening thereafter. At 22:00 UTC that day, Opal made landfall between Pensacola Beach, Florida and Navarre Beach, Florida, on a stretch of beach now known as &quot;Opal Beach&quot;, as a weakened Category 3 hurricane with winds of . Weakening quickened as Opal moved further inland, degenerating into a tropical depression over Tennessee less than a day after landfall. The diffusing cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards; these extratropical remnants tracked towards the northeast before they were last noted along the northern shore of Lake Ontario in Eastern Ontario.
==Preparations==

Although Opal was a weak system located over the Yucatán Peninsula at the time, 350 people evacuated from Grand Isle, Louisiana on September 28 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten Louisiana Highway 1—the only thoroughfare connecting Grand Isle with the Louisianan mainland. The following day, oil companies operating offshore oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land. On October 1, a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the United States Coast due to the risk of storm surge from Opal. The United States Coast Guard issued an advisory for boaters in the Gulf of Mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible. The next day, the Galveston, Texas, emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city. Meanwhile, the launch Space Shuttle Columbia&#x27;s STS-73 mission set for October 5 was postponed due to Opal&#x27;s anticipated effects.

On October 3, a voluntary evacuation order was placed on Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, due to the risks of potential storm surge. Schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish. Voluntary evacuation orders for the Florida panhandle, which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area, also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders. Farther west, a mandatory evacuation order was placed on Mobile County, Alabama, by then-Governor Fob James. Just before noon on October 4, with the hurricane near landfall, Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties halted evacuations, instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead. However, the large number of evacuees led to severe traffic congestion; Escambia County officials estimated that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before Opal made landfall. Mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of October 4, though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force winds.

An estimated 100,000 people evacuated from the United States Gulf Coast ahead of Opal, with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties; in their post-storm assessment the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) noted that the landfalls of Hurricane Allison and Hurricane Erin on the Florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for Hurricane Opal—some people may have taken a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach that resulted in complacency, while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by Erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane. Regardless, the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic, and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for Opal. Traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds.

The post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with Opal were a flash flood warning released on October 5 for portions of Alabama, northern Georgia, and the western parts of North Carolina and South Carolina. The warning also included eastern Tennessee. A flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the Upper Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic region, the central Appalachians, and the lower Great Lakes. Wind warnings were in effect for northwestern South Carolina all the way to western New York. A gale watch was also in effect for Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the southern sections of the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Six hours later, the gale warnings over Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the southern sections of the St. Lawrence Seaway were upgraded into a storm warning for Erie alone. The gale warning for the other two sections remained. The shoreline of Lake Erie was under a beach erosion warning from Buffalo, New York to Ripley, New York. The Storm Prediction Center released a tornado watch for northern and central New Jersey and portions of New York and Connecticut on October 6.

Significant non-surge areas of Escambia County, Florida, south of US 98 were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by flooding.

==Impact==
===Mexico and Central America===
Although Opal was only a weak tropical storm when it affected the Yucatán Peninsula, its slow movement led to prolonged, flooding rains over much of the region. Tabasco received about 20 percent of its annual rainfall in four days due to the cyclone. Across Campeche and Tabasco, more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overflowed their banks. According to Notimex, approximately 100,000 people evacuated due to the storm. By October 1, an estimated 500,000 acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods. In San Francisco de Campeche, flood waters reached a depth of . Governor Jorge Salomon ordered the closure of all government offices, businesses, and schools by October 2 in light of the extensive flooding. At least 60 towns across the state were isolated by the extreme rainfall. By October 3, agricultural losses in Campeche alone were estimated in the billions of pesos (hundreds of millions of USD). At least 19 people perished across Mexico while another 31 were killed in Guatemala.

===Florida===
About of Florida&#x27;s coastline felt the impact of Hurricane Opal.

Rainfall in Florida peaked at in Ellyson, at Pensacola, and at Hurlburt Field. The highest gust recorded was a gust at the latter. Lower gusts were at Eglin Air Force Base and an gust at Pensacola P.N.S. The highest sustained winds were at Hurlburt Field and at Eglin Air Force Base. Opal brought heavy surge to the area, in some places, comparing itself to Hurricane Eloise, which struck the same area at near equal strength in 1975. The two reported storm surges were above normal at Apalachicola and above normal at Sarasota.
Opal caused about US$4.7 billion (1995 dollars) in damage, making it the third costliest hurricane at the time. Most of the structural damage occurred near the coastline on the Florida Panhandle, due to intense surge. Nearly a mile of U.S. Highway 98 near Eglin Air Force Base was completely destroyed. The pavement was nearly replaced by mounds of sand left behind after storm surge. Opal also spawned an F2 tornado that killed a young woman in Florida. None died as a direct result of storm surge. This was quite unusual, considering the strength and landfall location of Opal. Okaloosa Island, Fort Walton Beach, was overwhelmed by storm surge. Numerous homes were under of water. Residents were not allowed to return to the island until the homes could be secured. A Humvee tour was arranged by the National Guard so home owners could &#x27;see&#x27; the damage, but the homeowners were not allowed off the bus. Sand dunes along the stretch of US 98, normally high, were removed by wind and surge. Where once the ocean was obscured from view by the dunes for miles, a flat open space opened up along U.S. Highway 98.

=== U.S. Gulf Coast ===

The peak rainfall from Opal in Alabama was east-northeast of Brewton, Alabama. Lesser amounts include in Mobile and in Anniston. The highest gust reported was a gust in Fort Rucker and a secondary one at Maxwell Air Force Base with a gust of . The highest sustained winds reported from Opal was at Fort Rucker, in downtown Mobile and at Maxwell Air Force Base and Montgomery. Numerous downed trees across much of the southeastern United States left over 2 million people without power. Alabama reported that 476,000 residents were without power, which was a record at the time; however, this number was surpassed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Damage was heavy far inland, all the way to Montgomery, where sustained winds reached .

Highest rainfalls in Mississippi were throughout the eastern side of the state with lower amounts going westward. Tropical-storm-force winds were reported along the Gulf Coast during the afternoon and early evening of October 4. Wind damage was mainly limited to downed tree limbs, power lines, and signs. One minor injury was reported in Harrison County due to flying debris. Damage in Mississippi totaled up to $75 thousand.

In Louisiana, the only significant wind damage occurred in extreme south Plaquemines Parish where winds were estimated around with gusts to hurricane force, with wind damage reported to some mobile homes and roofs of a few other structures. Tropical storm force winds were reported in extreme south Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish, as well as extreme east St. Bernard Parish. Property damage cost estimated. Tides were generally above normal in Lake Pontchartrain, and three to five feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coast from Grand Isle eastward. Some low-lying coastal roads were flooded. Approximately 10,000 people evacuated from the southern, or lower, portions of Plaquemines, St. Bernard, Lafourche, and Jefferson Parishes. The only significant gathering of persons in public shelters occurred in Plaquemines Parish, where 1,600 people were placed in public shelters. Although no direct injuries occurred from the hurricane, an indirect injury is attributed to the hurricane in a freak accident. A Jefferson Parish employee was injured while attempting to lower a large flag on October 4. The employee, who was holding onto a rope attached a flag, was tossed high into the air, and suffered severe injuries when he fell back to the ground. Total damage in Louisiana totaled out to US$200,000 (1995 dollars).

Breaking swells from Opal in Texas caused water to spill across at the usual wash-over points which damaged several vehicles.

=== Southeastern United States ===
The peak rainfall in Georgia was in Marietta, in Peachtree City, and in west Atlanta. Southern Georgia only reported of rain, while the northern part of the state reached about . The peak wind gust in Georgia was a gust in Marietta, a gust in Columbus, and a gust in the Atlanta-Hartsfield area. High winds in Rabun County caused $5 million (1995 USD) from the approach of Opal on October 5. The damage was worst in Rabun County where numerous trees were blown down. The wind damage was described as being worse than the March Superstorm of 1993. Power was out for some people for at least a week. More than 4000 trees were knocked down within the city of Atlanta alone. These trees fell across roads, and on power lines, homes, mobile homes, and automobiles. More than a half a dozen people were injured from falling trees in the early morning hours of October 5. There were more than 1200 telephone poles knocked down and almost 5,000 power lines snapped. Power crews from surrounding states helped to restore power to many, however, thousands of residences remained without power through the weekend.

An gash was torn out of Interstate 285 between Roswell Road and the Glenridge Connector in Atlanta. Schools were closed on October 5 and 6 throughout the cities of Atlanta, Marietta, and in Fulton, Coweta, Carroll and Douglas counties. A total of 47 of 101 schools were closed in Dekalb County alone. Four state parks were closed after Opal: Moccasin Creek Park, Black Rock Mountain, Vogel State Park, and Fort Mountain State Park. 273 stations reported many falling traffic lights.

<text>John Baptist Wolf (July 16, 1907 – April 22, 1996) was an American historian, specializing in modern European history.

==Life==
Born in Ouray, Colorado, on July 16, 1907, Wolf was the son of a German immigrant.

Wolf received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Colorado, then attended Northwestern University, before entering the doctoral program at the University of Minnesota. He received his doctorate in 1934 for a dissertation on the diplomatic history of the Baghdad Railway, published in 1936.

Wolf began his teaching career at the University of Missouri in 1934, remaining there until 1943, when he took a position at the University of Minnesota. In 1966 he moved to the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle, retiring in 1974 as professor emeritus. 
Wolf died of leukemia on April 22, 1996 while living in a retirement community located near Syracuse. Writing his obituary (&quot;AHA Perspectives&quot; Dec. 1996), two of his students, Joseph Klaits and John T. O&#x27;Connor, recalled &quot;his wit, passion for history, and zest for life&quot; that stimulated his classes.

==Work==
Wolf published a number of important books, including &quot;France, 1815 to the Present&quot; (1940), &quot;The Emergence of the Great Powers (1685–1715)&quot; (1951), &quot;Toward a European Balance of Power (1640–1720)&quot; (1969). His most important study was the major biography, &quot;Louis XIV&quot; (1968).

In retirement Wolf published &quot;The Barbary Coast: Algiers under the Turks, 1500-1730&quot; (1979), which was translated into Arabic. He was twice a fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, first in Paris (1959–60), then in Madrid (1967–68). For his work in French history, Wolf was decorated as a Chevalier des Palmes Académiques by the French government in 1979. He was also president of the Society for French Historical Studies (1968–69).

<text>Henry B. Krajewski (July 15, 1912 – November 8, 1966) was an American politician who ran for president of the United States in 1952 (for the Poor Man&#x27;s Party) and in 1956 (for the American Third Party). He was also an American Third Party candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey in 1954. He also ran for governor of New Jersey three times, in 1953 (Jersey Veterans Bonus), 1957 (American Third Party), and 1961 (Veterans Bonus Now).

==Biography==
Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, Krajewski had an imposing stature; he stood six feet tall (1.83 m) and weighed 240 pounds (109 kg). In 1952, he owned and ran a 4,000-pig farm in Secaucus, New Jersey. With printing-press operator Frank Jenkins as his running mate, his platform included a one-year tax moratorium for every taxpayer with an annual income below $6,000, and one free pint of milk a day in school for every child. He won 4,203 votes. In 1956, Krajewski&#x27;s running mate was Anna Yezo, he got 1,829 votes.

<text>Araucaria (; original pronunciation: [a.ɾawˈka. ɾja]) is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae. While today they are largely confined to the Southern Hemisphere, during the Jurassic and Cretaceous they were globally distributed. There are 20 extant species in New Caledonia (where 14 species are endemic, see New Caledonian &quot;Araucaria&quot;), eastern Australia (including Norfolk Island), New Guinea, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay.

The genus is familiar to many people as the genus of the distinctive Chilean pine or monkey-puzzle tree (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;). No distinct vernacular name exists for the genus. Many are called &quot;pine&quot;, although they are only distantly related to true pines, in the genus &quot;Pinus&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Araucaria&quot; are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem, reaching a height of . The horizontal, spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle-like leaves. In some species, the leaves are narrow, awl-shaped and lanceolate, barely overlapping each other; in others they are broad and flat, and overlap broadly.

The trees are mostly dioecious, with male and female cones found on separate trees, though occasional individuals are monoecious or change sex with time. The female cones, usually high on the top of the tree, are globose, and vary in size among species from in diameter. They contain 80–200 large edible seeds, similar to pine nuts, though larger. The male cones are smaller, long, narrow to broad cylindrical, and broad.

==Taxonomy==
The genus is named after the Spanish exonym &quot;Araucano&quot; (&quot;from Arauco&quot;) applied to the Mapuche of south-central Chile and south-west Argentina, whose territory incorporates natural stands of a species in this genus identified as &quot;A. araucana&quot;; the Mapuche people call it &#x27;, and consider it sacred. Some Mapuche living in the Andes name themselves Pehuenche (&quot;people of the &#x27;&quot;) as they traditionally harvested the seeds extensively for food.

There are four extant sections and two extinct sections in the genus, sometimes treated as separate genera.


===Extant species===
===Genetic studies===
Genetic studies indicate that the extant members of the genus can be subdivided into two large clades – the first consisting of the sections &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Bunya&quot;, and &quot;Intermedia&quot;; and the second of the strongly monophyletic section &quot;Eutacta&quot;. Sections &quot;Eutacta&quot; and &quot;Bunya&quot; are both the oldest taxa of the genus, with &quot;Eutacta&quot; possibly older.

&quot;Araucaria bindrabunensis&quot; (previously classified under section &quot;Bunya&quot;) has been transferred to the genus &quot;Araucarites&quot;.

==Distribution and paleoecology==
Members of &quot;Araucaria&quot; are found in Argentina, Brazil, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Australia, New Guinea, Chile and Papua (Indonesia). Many if not all current populations are relicts, and of restricted distribution. They are found in forest and maquis shrubland, with an affinity for exposed sites. The earliest records of the genus date to the Middle Jurassic, represented by &quot;Araucaria mirabilis&quot; of Argentina, and &quot;Araucaria sphaerocarpa&quot; from England. Fossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the Cretaceous period.

By far the greatest diversity exists in New Caledonia, likely due to a relatively recent adaptive radiation, as all New Caledonian species are more closely related to each other than they are to other &quot;Araucaria&quot;. Much of New Caledonia is composed of ultramafic rock with serpentine soils, with low levels of nutrients, but high levels of metals such as nickel. Consequently, its endemic &quot;Araucaria&quot; species are adapted to these conditions, and many species have been severely affected by nickel mining in New Caledonia and are now considered threatened or endangered, due to their habitat lying in prime areas for nickel mining activities.

Some evidence suggests that the long necks of sauropod dinosaurs may have evolved specifically to browse the foliage of tall trees, including those of &quot;Araucaria&quot;. An analysis of modern &quot;Araucaria&quot; leaves found that they have a high energy content but are slow fermenting, making their ancestors a likely attractive target.

==Uses==

Some of the species are relatively common in cultivation because of their distinctive, formal symmetrical growth habit. Several species are economically important for timber production.

===Food===

The edible large seeds of &quot;A. araucana&quot;, &quot;A. angustifolia&quot; and &quot;A. bidwillii&quot; — also known as &quot;Araucaria&quot; nuts, and often called, although improperly, &quot;pine nuts&quot; — are eaten as food, particularly among the Mapuche people of Chile and southwest Argentina, the Kaingang people in Southern Brazil and among Indigenous Australians.
In South America &quot;Araucaria&quot; nuts or seeds are called &quot;piñas&quot; or &quot;piñones&quot; in Spanish and &quot;pinhões&quot; in Portuguese, like pine nuts in Europe.

===Pharmacological activity===
Pharmacological reports on genus Araucaria are anti-ulcer, antiviral, neuro-protective, anti-depressant and anti-coagulant.

<doc id="324262" wikidata="Q196667" url="?curid=324262" title="Fideism">
<text>Fideism ( ) is a standpoint or an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). The word &quot;fideism&quot; comes from , the Latin word for faith, and literally means &quot;faith-ism&quot;. Philosophers have identified a number of different forms of fideism. Strict fideists hold that reason has no place in discovering theological truths, while moderate fideists hold that though some truth can be known by reason, faith stands above reason.

Theologians and philosophers have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of metaphysical ideas, morality, and religious beliefs. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: Søren Kierkegaard, Blaise Pascal, William James, and Ludwig Wittgenstein; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers. A qualified form of fideism is sometimes attributed to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s famous suggestion that we must &quot;deny knowledge in order to make room for faith&quot;.

== Overview ==
Alvin Plantinga defines &quot;fideism&quot; as &quot;the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and is used especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth&quot;. The fideist therefore &quot;urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious&quot;, and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason. The fideist seeks truth, above all, and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.

=== History ===
=== Theories of truth ===

The doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:
* Correspondence theory of truth
* Pragmatic theory of truth
* Constructivist epistemology
* Consensus theory of truth
* Coherence theory of truth
* Subjectivism

=== Tertullian ===

Tertullian taught fideistic concepts such as the later philosophers William of Ockham and Søren Kierkegaard. Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;De Carne Christi&quot; (On the Flesh of Christ]) says &quot;the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.&quot;

On the other hand, some deny Tertullian&#x27;s fideistic character, the statement &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot; (&quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot;) is sometimes cited as an example of views of the Church Fathers. However, this has been argued to have been a misquotation of Tertullian, saying that Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but that he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.

=== William of Ockham ===
Ockham was a fideist, holding that belief in God is only a matter of faith and not from knowledge; this led him to deny all the alleged proofs of God.

=== Luther ===
Martin Luther taught that faith informs the Christian&#x27;s use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, &quot;All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.&quot; And &quot;Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has.&quot; However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, &quot;Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life.&quot;

=== Blaise Pascal and fideism ===

Another form of fideism is assumed by Pascal&#x27;s Wager, which is a rational argument for a pragmatic view of God&#x27;s existence. Blaise Pascal invites the atheist considering faith to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward. He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal&#x27;s Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific god, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian version (referred to both by Jews and Christians as God), as is mentioned in the following quote. In his &quot;Pensées&quot;, Pascal writes:
Pascal, moreover, contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to deism instead of revealed religion: &quot;The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—not the god of the philosophers!&quot;

=== Hamann and fideism ===
Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, Johann Georg Hamann promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of David Hume he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith. Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like Spinozism that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.

===Kant&#x27;s qualified fideism===
Hamann was a personal friend of Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers of the modern era. While Kant and Hamann disagreed about both the use of reason and the scientific method, there were also a number of points of agreement between them. For instance, one of the views defended in Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is that reason is incapable of attaining knowledge of the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, a point with which Hamann would agree. The most important difference on this point is that Kant did not think that this gave way to antirationalism, whereas Hamann did. As a result, a qualified form of fideism is sometimes attributed to Kant. This modified form of fideism is also evident in his famous suggestion that we must &quot;deny knowledge in order to make room for faith&quot;.

===Kierkegaard===
Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God&#x27;s existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and his followers in Christian existentialism. Many of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works, including &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, are under pseudonyms; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.

In &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, Kierkegaard focused on Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham&#x27;s act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted murder, perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general. He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the &quot;absolute paradox&quot;, since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.

===James and &quot;will to believe&quot;===
American pragmatic philosopher and psychologist William James introduced his concept of the &quot;will to believe&quot; in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.

William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: &#x27;passivity&#x27;, &#x27;ineffability&#x27;, &#x27;a noetic quality&#x27;, and &#x27;transiency&#x27;. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

=== Wittgenstein and fideism ===
The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic (e.g., student notes published as &quot;Lectures on Religious Belief&quot;), and various remarks about religions appear in sources such as the &quot;Remarks on Frazer&#x27;s Golden Bough&quot;, his private diaries, and in Culture and Value. In his 1967 article, entitled &quot;Wittgensteinian Fideism&quot;, Kai Nielsen argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein&#x27;s thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a &quot;fideistic&quot; manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or &quot;grammar&quot;. This view—commonly called &quot;Wittgensteinian fideism&quot;—states: that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view. 

Wittgenstein stated that &quot;Christianity is not based on historical truth; rather, it offers us a historical narrative and says: now believe! But not, believe this narrative with the belief appropriate to a historical narrative, rather: believe, through thick and thin&quot;. For Wittgenstein you should &quot;not take the same attitude to it as you take to other historical narratives...there is nothing paradoxical about that!&quot; and that &quot;The historical accounts in the Gospel, might historically speaking, be demonstrably false yet belief would lose nothing by this&quot;.

=== Shestov ===
Lev Shestov is associated with radical fideism, holding that religious truth can only be gained by rejecting reason.

=== Fideism and presuppositional apologetics ===
Presuppositional apologetics is a Christian system of apologetics associated mainly with Calvinist Protestantism; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism. It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the revelation contained in the Bible is axiomatic, rather than transcendentally necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic foundationalism). To non-believers who reject the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the &quot;transcendental argument for God&#x27;s existence&quot; (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as Cornelius Van Til, believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.

Presuppositional apologetics could be seen as being more closely allied with foundationalism than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.

== Criticism ==

=== Fideism rejected by the Catholic Church ===
Catholic doctrine rejects fideism, with its earliest condemnations dating back to 1348. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God&#x27;s existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason.

The Anti-Modernist oath promulgated by Pope Pius X required Catholics to affirm that:

Similarly, the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; teaches that:
Pope John Paul II&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Fides et Ratio&quot; also affirms that God&#x27;s existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against &quot;a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God&quot;.

==== Fideist currents in Catholic thought ====
Another course of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of &quot;signs of contradiction&quot;. According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes some instances of reasoning to go astray.

=== As sin ===
Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. &quot;Blind faith&quot; is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
* Peter Abelard – &quot;Sic et Non&quot;
* Lord Herbert – &quot;De Veritate&quot;

=== As relativism ===
Some critics argue that fideism can lead to relativism.

=== A case for reason ===

Some critics note the successful use of reason in the daily lives of people to solve problems. That reason has led to an increase of knowledge, including in the sphere of science.

<text>Howard Ellsworth &quot;Smoky Joe&quot; Wood (October 25, 1889 – July 27, 1985) was an American professional baseball player for 14 years. He played for the Boston Red Sox from 1908 to 1915, where he was primarily a pitcher, and for the Cleveland Indians from 1917 to 1922, where he was primarily an outfielder. Wood is one of only 13 pitchers to win 30 or more games in one season (going 34–5 in 1912) since 1900.

==Early career==
Wood played his first amateur baseball for a local minor league team in Ouray, Colorado. He made his debut with the mostly-female &quot;Bloomer Girls.&quot; There were many such teams across the country, which barnstormed in exhibition games against teams of men. Bloomer Girl rosters featured at least one male player.

Red Sox star Ted Williams, as a guest on the Bill Stern&#x27;s &quot;The Colgate Sports Newsreel&quot; radio program in 1950, told the story Wood was posing as a girl on a girls&#x27; team when the Red Sox signed him. The story ended, &quot;The pitcher I&#x27;m talking about was the immortal Smoky Joe Wood. A pitcher who can never be forgotten even though he did get his start posing as a girl&quot;.

After joining the Red Sox in 1908 at 18, Wood had his breakthrough season in 1911 in which he won 23 games, compiled an earned run average of 2.02, threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Browns and struck out 15 batters in a single game. Wood once struck out 23 batters in an exhibition game. He earned the nickname &quot;Smoky Joe&quot; because of his blazing fastball. Wood recounted in the seminal 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, &quot;I threw so hard I thought my arm would fly right off my body.&quot;

His peers concurred. A story that gained common parlance was that legendary fastballer and pitching contemporary Walter Johnson once said, &quot;Can I throw harder than Joe Wood? Listen, my friend, there&#x27;s no man alive can throw harder than Smoky Joe Wood!&quot; Reminded of Johnson&#x27;s supposed assessment 60 years later, Wood said, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t think there was ever anybody faster than Walter.&quot; Johnson, whether being as usual self-effacing or literal, did say Wood could throw as hard as he could for two or three innings, but his delivery put much strain on his arm. Johnson had a speed faster than anyone measured with the photo-electric system (used occasionally in the 1910s through 1930s), but Wood when tested in 1917 had already suffered a career-changing injury.

==1912 season==
Wood&#x27;s best season was in 1912, when he had an ERA of 1.91, 258 strikeouts, a record of 34 wins and only 5 losses. Only 21 times since 1900 have pitchers won 30 or more games, with Wood&#x27;s 34 victories ranking as the sixth-highest total. He also tied Walter Johnson&#x27;s record for consecutive victories with 16.

During the 1912 season, Wood had a 13-game winning streak and Johnson had his own American League record 16-game winning streak snapped. On September 6, 1912, Wood faced off against Johnson in a pitching duel at Fenway Park. Originally, Wood was not scheduled to pitch that day, but the Washington Senators challenged the Red Sox to move Wood up in the rotation, so Wood could oppose Johnson. The papers of the time hyped the matchup like a heavyweight prizefight, and a standing-room-only crowd of 29,000 packed the park that day. Johnson and Wood dueled to a scoreless tie through five innings, when with two outs in the sixth, Boston&#x27;s Tris Speaker doubled to left on a 1–2 count and Duffy Lewis knocked him in with a double down the right-field line. Meanwhile, Wood gave up only two hits and no runs, and the Red Sox prevailed, 1–0.

 Equally compelling in drama, Wood&#x27;s Red Sox faced John McGraw&#x27;s New York Giants in the 1912 World Series. After slugging it out in seven close games, the teams met for the deciding game eight at Fenway with future Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson starting for the Giants. After Boston tied the score 1–1 in the bottom of the seventh, Wood came in to pitch. He matched Mathewson in the eighth and ninth, and the game went into extra innings. In the top of the tenth, Fred Merkle got to Wood knocking in a run with a single. But in the bottom of the tenth, Clyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, hit an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field, and Snodgrass dropped the ball. Given new life, the &quot;Snodgrass Muff&quot; cost the Giants as Speaker and Larry Gardner each knocked in a run to overcome the 1-run deficit. Wood and the Red Sox won the game 3–2 and the series 4–3–1. For Wood, the game was his third win in the series against one loss. He also struck out 11 batters in one game, becoming the first pitcher to record double-digit strikeouts in a World Series game.

==Position player==
The following year, Wood slipped on wet grass while fielding a bunt in a game against the Detroit Tigers. He fell and broke his thumb, and pitched in pain for the following three seasons. Although he maintained a winning record and a low ERA, his appearances were limited, as he could no longer recover quickly from pitching a game. Wood sat out the 1916 season and most of the 1917 season, and for all intents and purposes ended his pitching career.

Late in the 1917 season, Wood was sold to the Cleveland Indians, where he rejoined former teammate Tris Speaker. Always proficient with the bat, Wood embarked on a second career as an outfielder. His former Boston teammate Babe Ruth would make a similar position change a season later in 1919.

Early in the 1918 season, Wood was struggling to establish himself as a regular player. But in a 19-inning game on May 24 against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, Wood hit two home runs, including the eventual game-winner in the 19th, and in Wood&#x27;s words, &quot;the worst was finally over.&quot;

Establishing himself as a solid player, Wood finished in the top 10 in the American League in runs batted in in two seasons (1918 and 1922), and in 1918 he also finished in the top ten in home runs, doubles, batting average and total bases. Wood pitched seven more times, all but one game in relief, winning none and losing one. He also appeared in four games in the 1920 World Series.

Wood finished his major league career after the 1922 season with a pitching record of 117–57 and an ERA of 2.03. His lifetime batting average was .283. In his final season with the Indians, he had his highest hit total for a season with 150, and also set a personal mark for RBI with 92.

==Later life==
Wood went on to become head baseball coach at Yale University from 1924 to 1941, where he compiled a record of 283–228–1 over 18 seasons. While at Yale, he coached his son Joe, who pitched briefly for the 1944 Red Sox.

Decades later, in 1981, Wood was present at an historic pitcher&#x27;s duel between Yale and St. John&#x27;s University, featuring future major leaguers (and teammates) Ron Darling and Frank Viola. Darling threw 11 no-hit innings for Yale, matched by Viola&#x27;s 11 shutout innings for St. John&#x27;s. Wood, sitting in the stands, recalled Ty Cobb and said, &quot;A lot of fellows in my time shortened up on the bat when they had to – that&#x27;s what the St. John&#x27;s boys should try against this good pitcher.&quot; Darling lost the no-hitter and the game in the 12th, and Wood called it the best baseball game he had ever seen. The account was recorded in Roger Angell&#x27;s &quot;New Yorker&quot; (July 20, 1981) article &quot;The Web of the Game&quot;, in Angell&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Late Innings&quot;, and, later, in the anthology &quot;Game Time: A Baseball Companion.&quot;

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. They explained what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot;, where a player of truly exceptional talent but a career curtailed by injury should still, in spite of not having had career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats, be included on their list of the 100 greatest players. Wood was also interviewed for Ritter&#x27;s famous 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;.

In 1984, Wood received a standing ovation on Old Timers Day at Fenway Park in Boston, some 72 years after his memorable season. Aged 94, he said he was happy that Boston remembered him as &quot;Smoky&quot;.

On January 3, 1985, Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti presented Joe Wood with the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. Wood, who was 95 years old, was given this honor in his home close to the Yale ball field. Joe Wood is the first big league player to be given an honorary degree by Yale University. He and Cole Porter are the only two men so honored outside of a traditional Yale commencement.

Wood died in West Haven, Connecticut on July 27, 1985. He was buried in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. He was the last surviving member of the 1912 World Champion Boston Red Sox. In 1995, he was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. On August 27, 2005, the Society for American Baseball Research&#x27;s Connecticut Chapter named itself the Connecticut Smoky Joe Wood SABR Chapter.

In 2013, Gerald C. Wood&#x27;s biography, &quot;Smoky Joe Wood: The Biography of a Baseball Legend&quot;, was published by the University of Nebraska Press.

<doc id="324272" wikidata="Q1113295" url="?curid=324272" title="Winslow, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Winslow is a market town and civil parish in north Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. It has a population of just over 4,400. It is located approximately south-east of Buckingham, and south-west of Bletchley (Milton Keynes).

==History==
Winslow was first recorded in a royal charter of 792–793 in which it was granted by Offa of Mercia to St Albans Abbey as &quot;Wineshauue&quot;, which means &#x27;Wine&#x27;s Burial Mound&#x27;. Compare , &#x27;low hill, mound&#x27;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Weneslai&quot;. 

A late Celtic copper torc has been found here, and also a silver drinking-cup of late Roman design.

The 1841 census reveals the population that year was 1,333.

==Notable buildings==
Winslow Hall sits on the main road leading into the town from Aylesbury. It was built possibly from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren by William Lowndes, secretary to the Treasury. His name and the date 1700 can be seen on the frieze over the door. The Anglican parish church in High Street, dating from about 1320 is dedicated to St. Laurence (St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Winslow), and is twinned with St Paul&#x27;s Church in Winslow, Arizona.

<doc id="324274" wikidata="Q940807" url="?curid=324274" title="Apsley, Hertfordshire">
<text>Apsley is a village in Hertfordshire, England, in a valley of the Chiltern Hills below the confluence of the River Gade and Bulbourne. It was the site of water mills serving local agriculture and from the early 19th century became an important centre for papermaking. Today it is a suburb of Hemel Hempstead.

==Origin of the name==
The name Apsley dates from the Anglo-Saxon period and means &quot;aspen wood&quot;.

==History==
===1798-1999===
It was the construction of the trunk canal (later to be called the Grand Union Canal) between London and the Midlands through the valley in 1798 that began its industrial rise at the start of the 19th century. The canal gave an easy way of transporting the raw and manufactured products to and from the mills.

John Dickinson, the inventor of a new method of continuous papermaking, purchased Apsley Mill in 1809. During the 1930s, Apsley Mill became a vast industrial complex and its owner, John Dickinson Stationery, acquired Shendish Manor for use as its sports and social club.

In the 1950s the adjacent town of Hemel Hempstead was designated a &quot;New Town&quot; as part of the provision of new residential areas surrounding London and Apsley became a part of the development, also giving its name to the new school of Apsley Grammar School at Bennetts End.

===21st century===
Apsley is an outer district of Hemel Hempstead and is still a busy commercial centre. The Victorian shops that grew up when it was a mill town now house newsagents, public houses, restaurants, and a range of small businesses. The former mill sites are taken up with supermarkets, retail parks and offices (including large offices on the Dolittle Meadows site occupied by Hertfordshire County Council, Epson, HSBC and until recently, British Telecom). Housing developments combining the canal-side location with the ease of access to Apsley railway station have been very successful, and Apsley Marina is a thriving location for boaters.

The local parish church is St Mary&#x27;s, in London Road. There is also a Methodist church.

An important local issue since the summer of 2003 is the proposal to build on land surrounding the Manor Estate in Apsley that had previously been designated as green belt land. A new housing estate, called the Aspen Estate, has since been built on the hills above the Manor Estate.

Frogmore Paper Mill is a working paper mill and visitor centre located in some of the original mill buildings. Paper continued to be made until 2006 a short distance away at Nash Mill by the global Sappi group. This too closed for production in 2006 but continued as a distribution centre for some time.
==Apsley timeline==
* 13th century – Ralf de Chenduit was granted land in the area. The local manor is still called Shendish Manor today.
* 1803 – First record of paper making in the area at Frogmore Mill.
* 1809 – John Dickinson, the inventor of a continuous mechanised papermaking process, purchased Apsley Mill and started making paper.
* 1811 – The &quot;Grand Junction Canal&quot;, later to be called the Grand Union Canal, opened to through traffic. The original route of part of the canal was higher up the side of the valley passing north of the &quot;George&quot; and the &quot;Three Tuns&quot; pubs on &quot;Belswains Lane&quot;. It put Apsley on the principal trade route from London to the north.
* 1836 – John Dickinson built his country house in nearby Nash Mills and called it Abbot&#x27;s Hill. It is now a private school.
* 1838 – The London and Birmingham Railway passed through the valley adjacent to the site but no station was built. Canals continued to be the primary commercial means of transport for Apsley&#x27;s mills.
* 1853 – Charles Longman, heir to the publisher Longman&#x27;s and partner to John Dickinson, bought the Shendish estate and built an impressive manor house.
* 1871 – The Church at Apsley End was opened for public worship; its construction was funded by Charles Longman.
* 1938 – Apsley railway station was built with backing from John Dickinson Ltd as a way to bring more people to work at the mills.
* 1939–1945 – John Dickinson&#x27;s was at its peak, and employed more than 7,000 workers. It made munitions as well as paper and paper products.
* 1999 – The last paper mills owned by John Dickinson were finally shut.
* 2003 – A working heritage and education centre was built around the framework of the remaining mill; its visitor centre aims to celebrate the links between the industry, the town and the international impact, innovations created in Apsley had upon the world.
* 2003 – Apsley Marina was established.
* 2011 – Local football club Apsley Athletic FC was formed.

<doc id="324276" wikidata="Q1020619" url="?curid=324276" title="Stagecraft">
<text>Stagecraft is a technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery; hanging and focusing of lighting; design and procurement of costumes; make-up; stage management; audio engineering; and procurement of props. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a scenic designer&#x27;s artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft may be executed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. Regional theaters and larger community theaters will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.
Within significantly larger productions, for example a modern Broadway show, effectively bringing a show to opening night requires the work of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. Modern stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition.

==History==

=== Ancient Greece ===
Greek theatre made extensive use of stagecraft, and Greek vocabulary and practice continue to influence contemporary Western stagecraft. The defining element of a Greek theatre&#x27;s stage was the skene, a structure at the back of the stage, often featuring three doors. The usual setting for a classical Greek tragedy was a palace, and skenes were decorated to support that setting. 

On the audience-side of the skene, what are now known as flats could be hung. Flats evolved from one-sided to two-sided painted flats, which would be mounted and centered on a rotating pin. Rope would run around each consecutive pin, allowing the flats to be turned for scene changes. The double-sided-flat eventually evolved into the periaktos.

Greek stagecraft was essential to the storytelling of its works. An &quot;ekkyklema&quot;, similar to a contemporary wagon, was used to present the death of a character by rolling out their dead body, instead of showing their death onstage. The &quot;mechane&quot;, a crane for lifting actors over the skene, supported the conclusions of plays, whose storylines were often suddenly resolved by the introduction of a god. The mechane is the literal source for the contemporary phrase deus ex machina. Performances were lit by sunlight, often taking advantage of the particular time of day to support the story.

=== Europe ===
Plays of Medieval times were held in different places such as the streets of towns and cities, performed by traveling, secular troupes. Some were also held in monasteries, performed by church-controlled groups, often portraying religious scenes. The playing place could represent many different things such as indoors or outdoors (as in the Cornish &quot;plen-an-gwary&quot; amphitheatres). They were played in certain places so the props could be used for the play. Songs and spectacles were often used in plays to enhance participation.

More modern stagecraft was developed in England between 1576 and 1642. There were three different types of theaters in London – public, private and court. The size and shape varied but many were suggested to be round theaters. Public playhouses such as the Globe Theatre used rigging housed in a room on the roof to lower and raise scenery or actors, and used the raised stage by developing the practice of using trap-doors in theatrical productions. Most of the theaters had circular-design, with an open area above the pit to allow sunlight to enter and light the stage.

Proscenium stages, or picture-box stages, were constructed in France around the time of the English Restoration, and maintain the place of the most popular form of stage in use to-date, and originally combined elements of the skene in design, essentially building a skene on-stage. Lighting of the period would have consisted of candles, used as foot-lights, and hanging from chandeliers above the stage.

Stagecraft during the Victorian era in England developed rapidly with the emergence of the West End. Prompted by and influx of urbanites in the greater London area, Parliament was forced to do away with previous licensing laws and allowed all theaters to perform straight plays in 1843. Electric lighting and hydraulics were introduced to draw large audiences to see on-stage storms, explosions, and miraculous transformations. Technologies developed during the latter part of the 19th-century paved the way for the development of special effects to be used in film.

Lighting continued to develop. In England, a form lamp using a blowpipe to heat lime to incandescence was developed, for navigation purposes – it was soon adapted to theatrical performances and the limelight became a widespread form of artificial light for theaters. To control the focus of the light, a Fresnel lens was used.

After candles, came gas lighting, using pipes with small openings which were lit before every performance, and could be dimmed by controlling the flow of gas, so long as the flame never went out. With the turn of the 20th century, many theater companies making the transition from gas to electricity would install the new system right next to the old one, resulting in many explosions and fires due to the electricity igniting the gas lines.

Modern theatrical lighting is electrically-based. Many lamps and lighting instruments are in use today, and the field is rapidly becoming one of the most diverse and complex in the industry.

==Sub-disciplines==

A wide range of disciplines are included in stagecraft, all of which are crucial to creating compelling and immersive theatrical productions. Stagecraft is the foundation of any theatrical play, impacting the audience&#x27;s experience, from the skilled application of lighting to the elaborate creation of scenery and costumes. Stagecraft promotes flawless performance execution and amplifies the emotional impact of storytelling by coordinating the interaction of visual and aural elements. Stagecraft is essential to producing captivating and unforgettable theatrical moments, whether it is through the creative application of makeup and wigs, the inventive use of mechanical scenery, or the well-planned fusion of sound and visual effects. Stagecraft brings dramatic dreams to life by a fusion of artistic innovation and technical mastery, making a profound impact on audiences all over the world.

Stagecraft comprises many disciplines, typically divided into a number of main disciplines:
* Lighting: Lighting design, which involves the process of determining the angle, size, intensity, shape, and color of light for a given scene as well as hanging, focusing, procurement and maintenance of lighting and special effects equipment, and aspects of show control.
* Make-up/Wigs: The application of makeup and wigs to accentuate an actor&#x27;s features.
* Mechanics: Design, engineering and operation of Flown scenery or flying of performers and mechanized scenic elements and special effects.
* Production, comprising stage management, production management, show control, house management, and company management
* Scenery, which includes set design, set construction, scenic painting, theater drapes and stage curtains, and special effects.
* Sound design, which can include musical underscoring, vocal and instrument mixing as well as theatrical sound effects. The sound designer is also responsible for the system design and build.
* Theatrical property, or props, which includes furnishings, set dressings, and all items large and small which cannot be classified as scenery, electrics, or wardrobe. Some crossover may apply. Props handled by actors are known as hand props, and props which are kept in an actor&#x27;s costume are known as personal props.
* Wardrobe: costume design, construction, procurement, and maintenance.
* Video (or Projection) is a relatively recent field of stagecraft which is gaining recognition. As well as being a discipline in itself, its role may also be taken on by the Lighting or Scenery disciplines.
* Stage automation: is the use and control of moving electronics that have the ability to move set pieces, set dressings and stage floor among many other stage elements. Stage automation may also include rigging when a motor is used to control lines or objects.

=== Scenery ===

The theater designer, responsible for orchestrating the visual and auditory aspects of a stage production, is traditionally known as the set designer. This convention has emerged for practical reasons, ensuring efficiency in the design process. Upon entering a theater, viewers are immediately drawn to the set design, shaping their initial impression of the show. In this moment, designers establish the show&#x27;s concept, define its style, evoke mood and atmosphere, and establish the tone by revealing the date and setting. Stage designers intentionally select elements to craft the audience&#x27;s perception of the depicted worlds in a play, rather than simply replicating settings realistically. For much of theatrical history, there was no dedicated scenic designer role. Instead, theater practitioners relied on stock scenery or utilized the space itself to establish settings.

=== Stage Management ===
While playwrights, producers, directors, designers, and performers all have specific roles to play, the stage manager is the one who manages the intricate collaboration between all of these important participants. Serving as the production&#x27;s center point, the stage manager makes sure that every aspect, from staff to materials, works in unison to realize the theatrical concept. Their responsibilities are broad and include managing backstage operations, organizing technical cues, and arranging rehearsals. In addition, the stage manager plays a pivotal role in mediating issues and fostering constructive communication between the actors and the creative team during the course of the production. As a result, even if the actors and directors receive most of the attention, the stage manager&#x27;s hard work and knowledge behind the scenes preserves the integrity and professionalism of live theater production.

<text>The Northern District (; ) is one of Israel&#x27;s six administrative districts. The Northern District has a land area of 3,324 km2, making it the second largest district in Israel.

The Golan Heights has been run as a sub-district of the North District of Israel since the 1981 Golan Heights Law was passed, although the claim is only recognized by the United States while United Nations Security Council condemned the annexation in its Resolution 497 without enforcing it. The Golan Heights covers a land area of 1,154 km2 and the remainder of the Northern District covers 3,324 km2 (3,484 km2 including water).

== Demographics ==
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics data for 2022:
* Total population: 1,527,800 (2022)
* Ethnic:
** Arabs: 816,800 (53.5%)
** Jews: 647,500 (42.4%)
** Others: 63,500 (4.2%)

In the Israeli census, no distinction is made between Arab citizens of Israel and Syrian inhabitants of the Golan Heights, many of whom are not citizens of Israel, but of Syria.

* Religious:
** Jews: 647,500 (42.4%)
** Muslims: 597,300 (39.1%)
** Druze: 120,300 (7.9%)
** Christians: 97,800 (6.4%)
** Not classified: 55,600 (3.6%)
* Density: 335/km2

The Northern District is the only district of Israel where the majority of inhabitants are Arabs.

<doc id="324288" wikidata="Q192303" url="?curid=324288" title="Treaty of Karlowitz">
<text>The Treaty of Karlowitz, concluding the Great Turkish War of 1683–1699, in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated by the Holy League at the Battle of Zenta, was signed in Karlowitz, in the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy (present-day Sremski Karlovci, Serbia), on 26 January 1699. Also known as &quot;The Austrian treaty that saved Europe&quot;, it marks the end of Ottoman control in much of Central Europe, with their first major territorial losses in Europe, beginning the reversal of four centuries of expansion (1299–1683). The treaty established the Habsburg monarchy as the dominant power of the region.

== Context and terms ==
Following a two-month congress between the Ottoman Empire on one side and the Holy League of 1684, a coalition of the Holy Roman Empire, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Republic of Venice and Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, a peace treaty was signed on 26 January 1699.

On the basis of &quot;&quot;, the treaty confirmed the territorial holdings of each power. The Habsburgs received from the Ottomans the Eğri Eyalet, Varat Eyalet, much of the Budin Eyalet, the northern part of the Temeşvar Eyalet and parts of the Bosnia Eyalet. That corresponded to much of Hungary, Croatia and Slavonia. The Principality of Transylvania remained nominally independent but was subject to the direct rule of Austrian governors. 

Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth recovered Podolia with the undestroyed fortress at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Although the fortress in Kamianets was not recaptured in the 1698 campaign). Therefore, the areas lost 27 years earlier in the Treaty of Buchach in 1672 were regained. In return, Commonwealth gave back captured fortresses in Moldova. The treaty also assumed the release of prisoners, the displacement of the Buda Tatars from Moldova, the end of Tatar raids, the rendition of fugitives (Cossacks to Commonwealth, Moldovans to Ottomans) and the cessation of tribute payments by Commonwealth. Commonwealth never again had a military conflict with Ottomans.

Venice obtained most of Dalmatia along with the Morea (the Peloponnese peninsula of southern Greece) though the Morea was restored to the Turks within 20 years by the Treaty of Passarowitz. There was no agreement about the Holy Sepulchre although it was discussed in Karlowitz.

The Ottomans retained Belgrade, the Banat of Temesvár (now Timișoara), as well as suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia. Negotiations with Tsardom of Russia for a further year under a truce agreed at Karlowitz culminated in the Treaty of Constantinople of 1700 in which the Sultan ceded the Azov region to Peter the Great. (Russia had to return the territories eleven years later after the failed Pruth River Campaign and the Treaty of the Pruth in 1711.)

Commissions were set up to devise the new borders between the Austrians and the Turks, with some parts disputed until 1703. Largely through the efforts of the Habsburg commissioner, Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, the Croatian and Bihać borders were agreed by mid-1700 and that at Temesvár by early 1701, leading to a border demarcated by physical landmarks for the first time.

The acquisition of some of Hungarian territories at Karlowitz and of the Banat of Temesvár 18 years later by the Treaty of Passarowitz, enlarged the Habsburg monarchy to its largest extent to that point, cementing Archduchy of Austria as a dominant regional power. It was later increased further in size by the acquisition of Polish territories in 1772 and 1795, by the annexation of Dalmatia in 1815, and by the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908.

The treaty was a watershed moment in the history of the Ottoman Empire, which for the first time lost substantial amounts of territory after three-and-a-half centuries of expansionism in Europe. Although the Ottoman borders in the region would wax and wane over the next 100 years, never again would there be any further acquisition of territory on a scale seen during the reigns of Mehmed the Conqueror, Selim the Grim, or Suleiman the Magnificent in the 15th-16th centuries. Indeed, after the mid-1700s the Ottoman frontier was largely delimited to the south of the Sava River and the Balkans proper, and would be further pushed south as the 19th century began.

<text>Theatrical production management is a sub-division of stagecraft. The production management team (consisting of a production manager and any number of assistants) is responsible for realizing the visions of the producer and the director or choreographer within constraints of technical possibility. This involves coordinating the operations of various production sub-disciplines (scenic, costume design, lighting, sound, projection, automation, video, pyrotechnics, stage management, etc.) of the presentation.

In addition to management and financial skills, a production manager must have detailed knowledge of all production disciplines including a thorough understanding of the interaction of these disciplines during the production process. This may involve dealing with matters ranging from the procurement of staff, materials and services, to freight, customs coordination, telecommunications, labor relations, logistics, information technology, , venue booking, scheduling, operations management, mending delay problems and workplace safety.

<text>The Canada Pension Plan (CPP; ) is a contributory, earnings-related social insurance program. It is one of the two major components of Canada&#x27;s public retirement income system, the other being Old Age Security (OAS). Other parts of Canada&#x27;s retirement system are private pensions, either employer-sponsored or from tax-deferred individual savings (known in Canada as a registered retirement savings plan). As of June 30, 2024, CPP Investments (CPPI) manages over C$646 billion in investment assets for the Canada Pension Plan on behalf of 22 million Canadians. CPPI is one of the world&#x27;s largest pension funds.

==Description==
The CPP mandates all employed Canadians 18 years of age and over to contribute a prescribed portion of their earnings income (with an equal matching amount contributed by their employer) to a federally administered pension plan. The plan is administered by Employment and Social Development Canada on behalf of employees in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which operates an equivalent plan, the Quebec Pension Plan (&quot;Régime des rentes du Québec&quot; in French). Because the Constitutional authority for pensions is shared between the provincial and federal governments, stewardship for the CPP is jointly shared. As a result, major changes to the CPP (including those that alter how benefits are calculated) require the approval of at least seven Canadian provinces representing at least two-thirds of the country&#x27;s population.
John Graham is the current CEO of the 
CPP

A province may choose to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan, as Quebec did in 1965, but must offer a comparable plan to its residents. Any province may establish an additional or supplementary plan anytime, as under section 94A of the Canadian Constitution, pensions are a provincial responsibility.

The CPP Fund is a professionally managed investment fund, overseen by the CPP Investments (CPPI), an independent organization that reports to the federal and provincial governments. The CPPI&#x27;s investment strategy is guided by a set of principles that emphasize long-term benefits security, a focus on quality, and a commitment to sustainability and responsible investment practices. CPPI also regularly reports on its investment performance and activities and is subject to oversight by the federal and provincial governments.

== History ==
The Liberal government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson established the Canadian Pension Plan in 1965.

Beginning in January 2024, a second earnings ceiling will be introduced, also known as CPP2. The first ceiling will be $68,500, while the second ceiling will be $73,200. The second ceiling is calculated &quot;in accordance with the CPP legislation and [taking] into account the growth in average weekly wages and salaries in Canada&quot;.

==Benefits==
The primary benefit provided by the CPP a monthly retirement pension. Currently, this is equal to 25% of the average earnings on which CPP contributions were made over the entire working life of a contributor from age 18 to 65 in constant dollars. The earnings upon which contributions are made are subject to an annual limit, which was $58,700 as of 2020. However, under changes being phased in by 2025, the pension benefit will rise to 33.33% of earnings on which contributions were made, and the maximum amount of income covered by the CPP will rise by 14% from the projected 2025 limit of $69,700 to $79,400.

The CPP enhancement will serve as a top-up to the existing, or base, CPP. For individuals who work and make contributions in 2019 or later, enhanced components of benefits will be calculated and added to the base portion of the benefit. These calculations are similar but follow different formulae.

When calculating the base portion of the CPP, there is a general drop-out provision that enables the lower-earnings years in a contributor&#x27;s contributory period to be dropped from the calculation of the average. Since 2014, the lowest 17% of earnings are dropped in this way, accounting for up to eight years of contributory earnings.

Benefits under the CPP enhancement will be calculated based on a forty-year period, using the best forty years to calculate the benefit. This calculation effectively allows seven years to be dropped from the benefit calculation (for an individual who begins contributing at age 18 and ends at age 65).

In October 2018, the average monthly benefits for a new retirement pension (taken at age 65) was just over $664.00 per month, and the maximum amount in 2019 was $1,154.58 per month. Monthly benefits are adjusted every year based on the Consumer Price Index. CPP benefit payments are taxable as ordinary income.

The standard age for receiving the retirement pension is age 65; however, individuals may begin collecting a permanently reduced pension as early as age 60 or defer payment until age 70 to increase the monthly payment. For those who take the pension early (the majority), the reduction factor is 0.6% for each month that benefits are received before age 65 (to a maximum reduction of 36%, at age 60). For those who defer, the adjustment rate is 0.7% for each month that one delays in receiving it, to a maximum increase of 42% at age 70. There is no financial benefit to delaying beyond age 70.

The CPP also provides disability pensions to eligible workers under the age of 65 who become disabled in a severe and prolonged fashion, and a monthly survivor&#x27;s pension to the spouse or common-law partners of contributors who die (having made sufficient contributions).

An application must be filed at least six months in advance in order to receive CPP benefits. If an application for disability pension is denied, an appeal can be made for reconsideration, and then to the Social Security Tribunal. All CPP benefits in pay are indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index.

==Contribution rates==
===1966 to 1996===
From 1966 to 1986, the contribution rate was 3.6%. The rate was 1.8% for employees (and a like amount for their employers) and 3.6% in respect of self-employed earnings. Contribution rates began rising by 0.2% per year in 1987. By 1997, this had reached combined rates of 6% of pensionable earnings.

===1998 reforms===
By the mid-1990s, the 3.6% contribution rate was not sufficient to keep up with Canada&#x27;s aging population, and it was concluded that the &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; structure would lead to excessively high contribution rates within about 20 years, due to Canada&#x27;s changing demographics, increased life expectancy, a changing economy, benefit improvements, and increased usage of disability benefits (all referenced in the Chief Actuary&#x27;s study of April 2007, noted above). The same study reports that the reserve fund was expected to run out by 2015. This impending pension crisis sparked an extensive review by the federal and provincial governments in 1996. As a part of the review, the federal government actively conducted consultations with the Canadian public to solicit suggestions, recommendations, and proposals on how the CPP could be restructured to achieve sustainability again. As a result of this public consultation process and internal review, the following key changes were proposed and jointly approved by the federal and provincial governments in 1997:

* Increase total CPP annual contribution rates (employer/employee combined) from 6% of pensionable earnings in 1997 to 9.9% by 2003.
* Continuously seek out ways to reduce CPP administration and operating costs.
* Move toward a hybrid structure to take advantage of investment earnings on accumulated assets. Instead of a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; structure, the CPP is expected to be 20% funded by 2014, with this funding ratio to constantly increase thereafter toward 30% by 2075 (that is, the CPP Reserve Fund will equal 30% of the liabilities, or accrued pension obligations).
* Create the CPP Investments (CPPI).
* Review the CPP and CPPI every 3 years.

As of 2019, the prescribed employee contribution rate was 4.95% of a salaried worker&#x27;s gross employment income between $3,500 and $57,400, to a maximum contribution of $2,668. The employer matches the employee contribution, effectively doubling the employee&#x27;s contributions. Self-employed workers must pay both halves of the contribution, or 9.9% of their pensionable income, when filing their income tax return. These rates have been in effect since 2003.

===2017 reforms===
The federal government and its provincial counterparts moved to enhance the Canada Pension Plan to provide working Canadians with more income in retirement. These changes were principally motivated by the declining share of the workforce that was covered by an employer defined-benefit pension plan, which had fallen from 48% of men in 1971 to 25% by 2011. They were given additional impetus by moves on the part of the government of Ontario to launch the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, a supplementary provincial pension plan intended to begin in 2018.

Unlike the existing, or base, CPP, the enhancement to the Canada Pension Plan will be fully funded, meaning that benefits under the enhancement will slowly accrue each year as an individual works and makes contributions. Additionally, the enhancement will be phased in over a period of seven years, starting in 2019. When fully mature, the enhanced CPP will provide a replacement rate of one third (33.33%) of covered earnings, up from the quarter (25%) provided previously. Additionally, the maximum income covered by the CPP will increase by 14% by 2025 (projected by the Chief Actuary of Canada to be $79,400 in 2025, compared to the projected normal limit of $69,700 in the same year in the 28th Actuarial Report on the CPP). The combination of the increased replacement rate and increased earnings limit will result in individuals receiving retirement pensions that are 33% to 50% higher, depending on their earnings across their working years. (The maximum retirement pension will increase by 50% but will require 40 years of contributions on earnings at the new maximum.) Workers earning the 2016 maximum covered wage of $54,900 a year would receive an additional $4,390 annually (approximately $365.83 monthly).

To finance the expanded pensions and maintain the soundness of the plan, contributions to the CPP by workers and their employers will each rise 1% from current levels to 5.95% over the existing band of covered earnings. This increase will be phased in over five years starting in 2019. The increase to the earnings threshold will be phased in over two years starting in 2024. Workers and their employers will contribute 4% on earnings in this range (i.e., earnings above the normal earnings limit and below the new, higher one). To ease the impact of the increased contribution on near-term disposable income, worker contributions will become tax-deductible.

==Funding==

===Description===
The base CPP is funded on a &quot;steady-state&quot; basis, with its current contribution rate set so that it will remain constant for the next 75 years, by accumulating a reserve fund sufficient to stabilize the asset/expenditure and funding ratios over time. This system is a hybrid between a fully funded one and a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; plan. In other words, assets held in the CPP fund are by themselves insufficient to pay for all future benefits accrued to date but sufficient to prevent contributions from rising any further. While a sustainable path for this particular plan, given the indefinite existence of a government, it is not typical of other public- or private-sector pension plans. A study published in April 2007 by the CPP&#x27;s chief actuary showed that this type of funding method is &quot;robust and appropriate&quot; given reasonable assumptions about future conditions.

The enhancement to the CPP will be fully funded, meaning that each generation will pay for the benefits it receives. Contributions made to the enhancement will be directed into a separate account.

The chief actuary submits a report to Parliament every three years on the financial status of the plan. Future reports will report on both the base and enhanced components of the plan.

===Assets===
As noted in the 27th Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan, if one uses the &quot;closed group approach&quot;, the plan has an enormous unfunded liability. As of December 31, 2015, the CPP&#x27;s unfunded liability was $884 billion, which is the difference between its liabilities ($1.169 trillion) and its assets ($285 billion).

===Unfunded liability===
While the unfunded liability has been increasing with every published Actuarial Report, the assets as a percentage of liabilities using the closed group approach has also been increasing since the 1996 reforms. The unfunded liabilities reported in the last few reports are:

Using the &quot;open group approach&quot; (&quot;one that includes all current and future participants of a plan, where the plan is considered to be ongoing into the future, that is, over an extended time horizon&quot;), the plan is reported to have assets in excess of $2.5 trillion. This approach uses a different definition of the term &quot;assets&quot;. &quot;Assets&quot; are the sum of (1) the CPP&#x27;s current assets and (2) the present value of future contributions for the next 150 years, totalling $2.544 trillion.

Unlike most pension plans, the unfunded liability is not reported on the balance sheet of the Canada Pension Plan&#x27;s financial statements. Consequently, the balance sheet reports that the CPP&#x27;s assets exceed its liabilities by $269 billion as of March 31, 2015.

==CPP Investment Board==
Under the direction of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, CPP Investments (CPPI) was created in 1997 as an organization independent of the government to monitor and invest the funds held by the CPP. In turn, the CPPI created the CPP Reserve Fund. The CPP Investment Board is a Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament. It reports quarterly on its performance, has a professional management team to oversee the operation of various aspects of the CPP reserve fund and to plan changes in direction, and a board of directors that is accountable to but independent from the federal government. The board reports annually to Parliament through the federal Minister of Finance.

==Quebec Pension Plan==
Quebec is the only province that opted out of the CPP upon its formation in 1965; the government of Quebec runs its own pension program. The Quebec Pension Plan (QPP; ) is Quebec&#x27;s version of the Canada Pension Plan. The QPP is managed by , which was formed from a merger of the (CARRA) and the (RRQ) in 2016. Closely mirroring the CPP, the QPP is a contributory earnings-related pension plan that pays benefits in the event of the earner becoming disabled, retiring, or dying. Both Quebec and the federal tax benefits are paid from the QPP.

===Increase in contribution rate===
The QPP&#x27;s contribution rate was 9.9% prior to 2012. In accordance with the 2011–12 Budget of the Government of Quebec, the contribution rate was increased by 0.15% per year for six years from 2012 to 2017. Consequently, the contribution rate increased to 10.8% for 2017 and subsequent years.

<text>The Phyllopharyngea are a class of ciliates, some of which are extremely specialized. Motile cells typically have cilia restricted to the ventral surface, or some part thereof, arising from monokinetids with a characteristic ultrastructure. In both chonotrichs and suctoria, however, only newly formed cells are motile and the sessile adults have undergone considerable modifications of form and appearance. Chonotrichs, found mainly on crustaceans, are vase-shaped, with cilia restricted to a funnel leading down into the mouth. Mature suctorians lack cilia altogether, and initially were not classified as ciliates.

The mouths of Phyllopharyngea are characteristically surrounded by microtubular ribbons, called &quot;phyllae&quot;. Nematodesmata, rods found in several other classes of ciliates, occur among the subclass Phyllopharyngia, most of which are free-living. In others, the mouth is often modified to form an extensible tentacle, with toxic extrusomes at the tip. These are especially characteristic of the suctoria, which feed upon other ciliates, and are unique among them in having multiple mouths on each cell. They are also found in many rhynchodids which are mostly parasites of bivalves.

<doc id="324304" wikidata="Q1754734" url="?curid=324304" title="Full Moon Fever">
<text>Full Moon Fever is the debut solo studio album by American musician Tom Petty, released on April 24, 1989, by MCA Records. It features contributions from members of his band the Heartbreakers, notably Mike Campbell, as well as Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison (who died prior to its release), and George Harrison, Petty&#x27;s bandmates in the Traveling Wilburys. The record showcases Petty exploring his musical roots with nods to his influences. The songwriting primarily consists of collaborations between Petty and Lynne, who was also a producer on the album. &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; became a commercial and critical success, peaking at No. 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified 5× platinum in the United States and 6× platinum in Canada.

MCA Records under Irving Azoff originally refused to issue the album, believing it did not contain any hits. Azoff resigned within a few months and, with new label management reviewing the album positively, they decided to release it. In 2019, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 298 on its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of all Time&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Having earlier in 1987 finished a Heartbreakers tour behind the album &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot;, Petty decided to record a solo album without the Heartbreakers (similar to the arrangement between Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band at the time). This stirred some controversy among members of the Heartbreakers, although all but drummer Stan Lynch contributed to the album. Benmont Tench and Howie Epstein initially were not happy about playing the &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; songs live during Heartbreakers concerts. Lynch hated playing them right up until his departure from the band, saying it made him feel like he was in a cover band.

The recording process in 1988 was a low-key affair, with many of Petty&#x27;s friends contributing, including the members of the Traveling Wilburys, except for Bob Dylan. Recorded mainly in the relaxed atmosphere of Mike Campbell&#x27;s garage studio, Petty would later say it was the most enjoyable record of his career. Recording of &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; was actually interrupted to allow time for recording of the first Wilburys&#x27; album. Two songs recorded during the sessions did not make the &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; album. &quot;Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Treat Me Like a Stranger&quot; were released as B-sides. During the sessions, Petty wrote &quot;Indiana Girl&quot;, an early draft of what would eventually become &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;.

==Musical style and themes==
The album is noted for being heavily influenced by Jeff Lynne, resulting in a cleaner and glossier version of the Heartbreakers&#x27; roots rock from previous albums. Lynne incorporated layers of keyboards and backing vocals, giving it a Beatlesque feel. The songs show Petty paying dues to his influences with a Byrds cover (&quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;) and a nod to Del Shannon in &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;. Other songs, such as &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot;, show Petty addressing nostalgia on his rise to fame. &quot;A Mind With a Heart of Its Own&quot; uses a Bo Diddley-style rhythm, while &quot;The Apartment Song&quot; features an instrumental break with paradiddle drumming reminiscent of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The album, which became Petty&#x27;s commercial peak as an artist, was helped by favorable critical reviews and three hit singles. The album was released on April24, 1989, and rose to eventually peak at No.3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No.8 in the UK. Five singles were released from the album; two hit the top 20 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot100 and three topped the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart. The RIAA certified &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; 5× platinum on October5, 2000, in the US and the CRIA certified it 6× platinum on September18, 1991, in Canada.

Critical praise was generally high. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the album favorably to the Traveling Wilburys&#x27; debut, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot;, saying it has the &quot;same restless charm&quot;, but commenting that &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; at times seems &quot;sprawling&quot;. The review claims the album is &quot;another rewarding, low-key side project for Petty&quot;, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted that &quot;some Petty fans might find this album to be a kind of cruise control, but its sheer unpretentiousness and crisp, non-doctored sound make it irresistible.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; opined that &quot;Lynne&#x27;s production is sometimes a little too clean, and there&#x27;s nothing earthshaking or innovative going on... But when was the last time you picked up an album this solid: tough, pretty, good rockin&#x27;, no filler?&quot;

AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five in a retrospective review, admiring the craft of the album and rivaling it with the Heartbreakers&#x27; &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot;. This review notes there are no weak tracks on the album, calling it a &quot;minor masterpiece&quot;. The 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; called &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; a &quot;masterful solo album&quot;. It was ranked number 92 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s, and was ranked number 298 in the 2020 update of the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2000. it was voted number534 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Track listing==

=== &quot;Hello, CD listeners ...&quot; ===
The original compact disc release of the album contains a hidden track in the pregap of Track 6 (&quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;), at the point where cassette or LP listeners would have to flip sides to continue. The track consists of a brief tongue-in-cheek monologue by Petty, over a background of barnyard noises (credited to Del Shannon). The interlude is not included in other physical versions of the album, though it is mentioned (as &quot;Attention CD Listeners&quot;) in the album credits of all versions. On some later CD and digital releases, it is added to the end of &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;, rather than the beginning of &quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;.

<doc id="324305" wikidata="Q8354932" url="?curid=324305" title="Right to privacy">
<text>The right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions that intends to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. Over 185 national constitutions mention the right to privacy. 
Since the global surveillance disclosures of 2013, the right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. Government agencies, such as the NSA, FBI, CIA, R&amp;AW, and GCHQ, have engaged in mass, global surveillance. Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual&#x27;s life; whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats; and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population. Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacyparticularly technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo that use and collect personal data.

==International ==
The right to privacy is a fundamental human right firmly grounded in international law. On10 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); while the right to privacy does not appear in the document, Article 12 mentions privacy: 

Privacy is later codified in successive (hard) international human human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:
# No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
# Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
::—International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 17

== History ==
The concept of a human &quot;right to privacy&quot; begins when the Latin word &quot;ius&quot; expanded from meaning &quot;what is fair&quot; to include &quot;a right – an entitlement a person possesses to control or claim something,&quot; by the Decretum Gratiani in Bologna, Italy in the 12th century.

In the United States, an article in the 15 December 1890, issue of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; entitled &quot;The Right to Privacy,&quot; written by attorney Samuel D. Warren II and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, is often cited as the first explicit finding of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren II and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the &quot;right to be let alone,&quot; and focused on protecting individuals. This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography and sensationalist journalism, also known as &quot;yellow journalism.&quot;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in &quot;Olmstead v. United States&quot; (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in the article &quot;The Right to Privacy.&quot; In that dissent, he urged that personal privacy matters were more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as to say that &quot;the government was identified as a potential privacy invader.&quot; He writes, &quot;Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.&quot; At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and potentially eavesdropping switchboard operators. By the time of &quot;Katz&quot;, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies raised more concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles.

In recent years, there have been few attempts to clearly and precisely define the &quot;right to privacy.&quot;

== As an individual right ==

Alan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as &quot;the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others&quot;. Westin describes 4 states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:

Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of themself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which they live.
:— Alan Westin, &quot;Privacy and Freedom&quot;, 1968

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression. Privacy to individuals is the ability to behave, think, speak, and express ideas without the monitoring or surveillance of someone else. Individuals exercise their freedom of expression through attending political rallies and choosing to hide their identities online by using pseudonyms.

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops &#x27;data protection&#x27; as an aspect of privacy, which involves &quot;the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information&quot;. This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, &quot;individuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used&quot;.

Marc Rotenberg has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: &quot;the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information.&quot; Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labor market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any &#x27;defect&#x27; in the &#x27;product&#x27; that is not reported is fraud. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims that &quot;the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right,&quot; and that &quot;individuals should be able to control information about themselves&quot;. Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

Adam D. Moore has argued that privacy, the right to control access to and use of personal information is closely connected to human well-being. He notes that &quot;having the ability and authority to regulate access to and uses of locations, bodies, and personal information, is an essential part of human flourishing&quot; and while &quot;the forms of privacy may be culturally relative . . . the need for privacy is not.&quot;

== As a collective value and a human right ==
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allow freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limit government power. Collective elements describe privacy as a collective good that cannot be divided. Regan&#x27;s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: &quot;if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection&quot;.

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.

== Privacy laws in different jurisdictions ==
Privacy laws apply to both public and private sector actors.

=== Australia ===

Australia does not have a constitutional right to privacy. However, the &quot;Privacy Act 1988&quot; (Cth) provides a degree of protection over an individual&#x27;s personally identifiable information and its usage by the government and large companies. The &quot;Privacy Act&quot; also outlines the 13 Australian Privacy Principles.

Australia also lacks a tort against invasions of privacy. In the 2001 case of , the High Court of Australia explained that there stood the possibility of &quot;a tort identified as unjustified invasion of privacy&quot;, but that this case lacked the facts to establish it. Since 2001, there have been some state-based casesnamely the 2003 case ; and the 2007 case that attempted to establish a tortious invasion of privacy, but these cases were settled before decisions could be made. Further, they have received conflicting analyses in later cases.

=== Canada ===
Canadian privacy law is derived from the common law, statutes of the Parliament of Canada and the various provincial legislatures, and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Perhaps ironically, Canada&#x27;s legal conceptualization of privacy, along with most modern legal Western conceptions of privacy, can be traced back to Warren and Brandeis’s &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot; published in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; in 1890, Holvast states &quot;Almost all authors on privacy start the discussion with the famous article &#x27;The Right to Privacy&#x27; of Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis&quot;.

=== China ===
The Constitution is the highest law in China. Privacy rights have been applied throughout China. The Constitution provides direction for all states in China and it further stipulates that &quot;all states must abide by and be held accountable for any violation of the Constitution and the law; the law specifically protects civil rights of a citizen&#x27;s personal dignity and confidentiality of correspondence.&quot; China has a new standard and the first of its kind for the country coming into effect 1 January 2021, the Civil Code is the first of its kind sweeping law replacing all laws covering general provisions, real property, contracts, personality rights, marriage and family, inheritance, tort liability, and supplementary provisions.

In many cases raised in the legal system, these rights have been overlooked as the courts have not treated each case with the same legal precedent for each case. China deploys mass surveillance on its population including through the use of closed-circuit television.

The 2021 Data Security Law classifies data into different categories and establishes corresponding levels of protection. It imposes significant data localization requirements, in a response to the extraterritorial reach of the United States CLOUD Act or similar foreign laws.

The 2021 Personal Information Protection Law is China&#x27;s first comprehensive law on personal data rights and is modeled after the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation.

=== European Union ===

The right to privacy is protected in the EU by European Convention on Human Rights Article 8:
Compared to the United States, the European Union (EU) has more extensive data protection laws.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

Under GDPR, data about citizens may only be gathered or processed under specific cases, and with certain conditions. Requirements of data controller parties under the GDPR include keeping records of their processing activities, adopting data protection policies, transparency with data subjects, appointing a Data Protection Officer, and implementing technical safeguards to mitigate security risks.

=== Council of Europe ===

The Council of Europe gathered to discuss the protection of individuals when the Convention Treaty No.108 was created and opened for signature by member states and for accession by non-member States.

The Convention closed and was then renamed Convention 108: Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.

Convention 108 has undergone 5 ratifications with the last ratification 10 January 1985 officially changing the name to Convention 108+ and providing the summary stating the intent of the treaty as:

&quot;The first binding international instrument which protects the individual against abuses which may accompany the collection and processing of personal data, and which seeks to regulate at the same time the transfrontier flow of personal data.&quot;

Increase use of the Internet and technological advancement in products lead to the Council of Europe to look at Convention 108+ and the relevance of the Treaty in the wake of the changes.

In 2011 the modernization of Convention 108+ started and completed in 2012 amending the treaty with Protocol CETS No223.

This modernization of Convention 108+ was in progress while the EU data protection rules were developed, the EU data protection rules would be adapted to become the GDPR.

=== India ===
The new data sharing policy of WhatsApp with Facebook after Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must decide if the right to privacy can be enforced against private entities.

The Indian Supreme Court with nine-judge bench under JS Khehar, ruled on 24 August 2017, that the right to privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens per Article 21 of the Constitution and additionally under Part III rights. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for the encroachment of any Article 21 right – legalityi.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object.

This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power. The Court adopted a liberal interpretation of the fundamental rights to meet the challenges posed an increasing digital age. It held that individual liberty must extend to digital spaces and individual autonomy and privacy must be protected.

This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalization of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private. India is the world&#x27;s biggest democracy and with this ruling, it has joined United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union, and the UK in recognizing this fundamental right.

India&#x27;s Data Protection law is known as Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

=== Israel ===
In Israel privacy protection is a constitutional basic right and is therefore protected by the Basic Law. Basic Law: the Knesset passed on 12 February 1958, by the Third Knesset. The Twelfth Knesset update to the Basic Law occurred on 17 March 1992. This update added to the law Human Dignity and Liberty by defining: Human freedom in Israel as being the right to leave the country and enter it, as well as the right to privacy and intimacy, refrainment from searches relating to one&#x27;s private property, body and possessions, and avoidance of violations of the privacy of one&#x27;s speech, writings and notes.

October 2006 Israel established a regulatory authority, the PPA, part of the Ministry of Justice. PPA defined the Privacy Law and associated regulates based on two principles: general right to online privacy and the protection of personal data stored in databases.

=== New Zealand ===

=== Russia ===
The Constitution of the Russian Federation: Article 45 states:

# State protection of human and civil rights and freedoms in the Russian Federation shall be guaranteed.
# Everyone shall the right to protect his (her) rights and freedoms by all means not prohibited by law.

The Russian Constitution specifically articles 23 and 24, institutes individual citizen the right to privacy. Russia, a member of the Strasbourg Convention, ratified processing of personal data against automatic processing and afterwards adopted a new convention. The new Russian Federal Law No.152-FZ R implemented on 27 July 2006, was updated to cover Personal Data and this law extends privacy to include personal and family secrets. Its main target is to protect individuals&#x27; personal data.

Privacy entered the forefront of Russian legislature in 2014 when the approach to privacy turned to the goal of protecting privacy of government operations and the people of Russia. The amendments originally modified the Personal Data Law which has since been renamed The Data Localisation Law. The new law requires business operators who collect any information on Russian citizens&#x27; must maintain the collected data locally. This means that data transmission, processing, and storage must be in a database in Russia. 1 March 2021, the new amendment came into effect. Consent from the data subject is required if the data operator wants to use the data publicly.

=== United States ===

The Constitution of the United States and United States Bill of Rights do not explicitly include a right to privacy. Currently no federal law takes a holistic approach to privacy regulation.

In the US, privacy and expectations of privacy have been determined via court cases. Those protections have been established through court decisions provide a reasonable expectations of privacy.

The Supreme Court in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479&quot; (1965) found that the Constitution guarantees a right to privacy against governmental intrusion via &quot;penumbras&quot; located in the founding text.

In 1890, Warren and Brandeis drafted an article published in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; titled &quot;The Right To Privacy&quot; that is often cited as the first implicit finding of a U.S. stance on the right to privacy.

Right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of civil liberties cases, including &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, which invalidated a successful 1922 Oregon initiative requiring compulsory public education; &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which struck down an abortion law from Texas, and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against abortion; and &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which struck down a Texas sodomy law, and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against sodomy. &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; later overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, in part due to the Supreme Court finding that the right to privacy was not mentioned in the constitution, leaving the future validity of these decisions uncertain.

Legally, the right of privacy is a basic law which includes:

# The right of persons to be free from unwarranted publicity
# Unwarranted appropriation of one&#x27;s personality
# Publicizing one&#x27;s private affairs without a legitimate public concern
# Wrongful intrusion into one&#x27;s private activities

However, outside of recognized private locations, American law, for the most part, grants next to no privacy for those in public areas. In other words, no verbal or written consent is needed to take photos or videos of those in public areas. This laxness extends to potentially embarrassing situations such as when actress Jennifer Garner bent over to retrieve something from her car and revealed her thong underwear to create a whale tail. Because the photographer took the photo in a public location, in this case a pumpkin patch, circulating the photo online was a legal act.

For the health care sector where medical records are part of an individual&#x27;s privacy, The Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in 1996. This act safeguards medical data of the patient which also includes giving individuals rights over their health information, like getting a copy of their records and seeking correction. Medical anthropologist Khiara Bridges has argued that the US Medicare system requires so much personal disclosure from pregnant women that they effectively do not have privacy rights.

==== CCPA ====
In 2018, California set out to create a policy promoting data protection, the first state in the United States to pursue such protection. The resulting effort is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), reviewed as a critical juncture where the legal definition of what privacy entails from California lawmakers&#x27; perspective. The California Consumer Protection Act is a privacy law protecting the residents of California and their Personal identifying information. The law enacts regulation over all companies regardless of operational geography protecting the six Intentional Acts included in the law.

The intentions included in the Act provide California residents with the right to:

# Know what personal data is being collected about them.
# Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
# Say no to the sale of personal data.
# Access their personal data.
# Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.
# Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

== Mass surveillance ==
=== United States ===
Governmental organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA), CIA, and GCHQ amongst others are authorized to conduct mass surveillance throughout other nations in the world. Programs such as PRISM, MYSTIC, and other operations conducted by NATO-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. Domestic law enforcement at the federal level is conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, so these agencies have never been authorized to collect US data. PRISM has faced criticism for privacy concerns, in that it collects &quot;metadata and communication content.&quot; However, scholars have argued that programs like PRISM do more good than harm, in that they protect Americans from foreign threats.

After the September 11 attacks, the NSA turned its surveillance apparatus on the US and its citizens.

In March 2013, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence at the time, testified under oath that the NSA does not &quot;wittingly&quot; collect data on Americans. Clapper later retracted this statement.

The US Government&#x27;s own Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) reviewed the confidential security documents, and found in 2014 that the program did not have &quot;a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference&quot; in counterterrorism or the disruption of a terrorist attack.

=== China ===
The Chinese government is conducting mass surveillance in Xinjiang province for detention of Muslims. As part of its &quot;Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism&quot; policy the authorities in China have subjugated 13 million Turkish Muslims to the highest order of restrictions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic the Chinese authorities documented the contact information and travel history of every individual and issued red, yellow and green badges/codes for transportation and entering stores. These badges/codes were also sometimes misused to freeze bank accounts and pressurize the protestors who were angry about the severe restrictions. The privacy of these health codes remain unacknowledged and unaddressed.

== Journalism ==

It is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the media, that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press. The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public has a right to know personal information about those with status as a public figure. This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of freedom of speech.

===Publication of private facts===
Publication of private facts speaks of the newsworthiness of private facts according to the law and the protections that private facts have. If a fact has significant newsworthiness to the public, it is protected by law under the freedom of the press. However, even if the fact is true, if it is not newsworthy, it is not necessarily protected. Digital Media Law Project uses examples such as sexual orientation, HIV status, and financial status to show that these can be publicly detrimental to the figure being posted about. The problem arises from the definition of newsworthiness.

===Newsworthiness===

According to Digital Media Law Project, the courts will usually side with the press in the publication of private facts. This helps to uphold the freedom of the press in the US Constitution. &quot;there is a legitimate public interest in nearly all recent events, as well as in the private lives of prominent figures such as movie stars, politicians, and professional athletes.&quot; Digital Media Law Project supports these statements with citations to specific cases. While most recent events and prominent figures are considered newsworthy, it cannot go too far and too deep with a morbid curiosity. The media gain a lot of leverage once a person becomes a prominent figure and many things about their lives become newsworthy. Multiple cases such as Strutner v. Dispatch Printing Co., 442 N.E.2d 129 (Ohio Ct. App. 1982) show that the publication of a person&#x27;s home address and full name who is being questioned by the police is valid and &quot;a newsworthy item of legitimate public concern.&quot; The last part to consider is whether this could be considered a form of doxxing. With the court upholding the newspaper&#x27;s right to publish, this is much harder to change in the future. Newsworthiness has much around it that is held up by court rulings and case law. This is not in legislation but is created through the courts, as many other laws and practices are. These are still judged on a case-by-case basis as they are often settled through a lawsuit of some form. While there is a fair amount of case law supporting newsworthiness of subjects, it is hardly comprehensive and, news publications can publish things not covered and defend themselves in court for their right to publish these facts.

== Technology ==

Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacyparticularly technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo that use and collect personal data. These private sector threats are more acute due to AI data processing.

In some American jurisdictions, the use of a person&#x27;s name as a keyword under Google&#x27;s AdWords for advertising or trade purposes without the person&#x27;s consent has raised certain personal privacy concerns. The right to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California&#x27;s &quot;online erasure&quot; law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. State laws, such as the CPPA in California, have granted more comprehensive protection.

However, the United States is behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors. The General Data Protection Regulation has made significant progress to protect privacy from these risks, and it has led to a wave of privacy and data protection laws around the world. 

Privacy is a major issue in the health care sector with technology becoming an essential component of it. Connecting personal data of patients to internet makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks. There are also concerns about how much data should be stored and who should have access to it.

== Protection of minors ==
=== United Kingdom ===
Laws and courts in the UK uphold the protection of minors in the journalistic space. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) in the UK have shown that the usage of footage of a 12-year-old girl being bullied in 2017 can be retroactively taken down due to fears of cyber-bullying and potential harm done to the child in the future. This was after the Mail Online published the video without any attempt to hide the identity of the child. Following the newsworthiness point, it is possible that content like this would be allowed in the United States due to the recentness of the event. Protection of minors is a different matter in the United States with new stories about minors doing certain things and their faces are shown in a news publication. The Detroit Free Press, as an example, chose to do a hard-hitting story about prostitution and drugs from a teenager but never named her or showed her face, only referring to her and the &quot;16-year-old from Taylor&quot;. In the UK, During the case of Campbell v MGN, Lord Hope stated that the protection of minors will be handled on a case-by-case basis and affected by the child&#x27;s awareness of the photo and their expectation of privacy. Many factors will be considered such as the age of the children, activity, usage of real names, etc.

=== United States ===
The protection of minors in the United States often falls on the shoulders of the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This protects any children under the age of 13 from the collection of their data without their parent&#x27;s or guardian&#x27;s permission. This law is the reason why many sites will ask if you are under 13 or require you to be 13 to sign up. While this law is intended to protect preteen children, it fails to protect the information of anyone older than 13, including teenage minors. It also begins to overlap with other privacy protection laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

<text>Sir John Richard Nicholas Stone (30 August 1913 – 6 December 1991) was an eminent British economist. He was educated at Gonville and Caius College and King&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge. In 1984, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and, later, an international scale.

==Early life and education==
Richard Stone was born in London on 30 August 1913. He received an English upper middle class education when he was a child as he attended Cliveden Place and Westminster School. However, he had not been taught mathematics and science until secondary school. When he was 17 years old, he followed his father to India as his father was appointed as a judge in Madras. From India, he visited many Asian countries: Malaya, Singapore, and Indonesia. After travelling for one year, he went back to London and then matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1931, where he studied law for two years.

The young Stone then changed to studying economics. He was interested in economics as he thought that &quot;if there were more economists, the world would be a better place&quot;. During the Great Slump of the 1930s, unemployment was very high and this motivated him to know what caused it and how to overcome it. He faced a challenge from his parents as they were disappointed with his choice. However, Stone was very enthusiastic to be an economist and then enjoyed his time studying economics. At his new major, he got supervision from Richard Kahn and Gerald Shove. However, Stone&#x27;s quantitative mind had been greatly influenced by Colin Clark, Stone&#x27;s teacher in statistics at Cambridge. Clark then introduced Stone to his project in measuring the national income. This project then brought the greatest name for Stone as he received Nobel Prize because of this topic. After their meeting at Cambridge, Stone and Clark then became best friends.

==Career==
After graduating from Cambridge in 1935 and until World War II he worked at Lloyd&#x27;s of London. During the war, Stone worked with James Meade as a statistician and economist for the British Government. At the government&#x27;s request, they analyzed the UK&#x27;s economy related to the current total resources of the nation for the war time. It was at this time that they developed the early versions of the system of national accounts. Their work resulted in the U.K.&#x27;s first national accounts in 1941.

The collaboration between Stone and Meade was over after 1941 as their office was split into two different ones. They then worked separately, Meade being responsible for the Economic Section and Stone, for the national income. In his new office, the Central Statistical Office, Stone became John Maynard Keynes&#x27; assistant. Stone left working for the government when the war ended in 1945.

After the war, Stone took up an academic career when he worked at Cambridge as the director of the new Department of Applied Economics (1945–1955). As the director, Stone made the Department focus on research programmes about economic theory and statistical methodology. This strategy attracted many top economists in that era to join the Department. Some remarkable works at the Department were, for example, Durbin and Watson on testing serial correlation in econometrics, and Alan Prest and Derek Rowe on demand analysis. This condition made DAE become one of the leading quantitative economic research centres in the world in his era. Stone himself had many projects in DAE: national accounting where he had employed Agatha Chapman as a research associate, the analysis of consumer demand, and the system of socio-demographic account.

In 1955, Stone gave up his Directorship at the department as he was appointed as the P.D. Leake Chair of Finance and Accounting at Cambridge (emeritus from 1980). Together with J.A.C. Brown he began the Cambridge Growth Project, which developed the Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the British economy (MDM). In building the Cambridge Growth Project, they used Social Accounting Matrices (SAM), which also formed computable equilibrium model which then developed at the World Bank. He was succeeded as leader of the Cambridge Growth Project by Terry Barker. In 1970, Stone was appointed as the Chairman of the Faculty Board of Economics and Politics for the next two years. A company founded by members of the Department and limited by guarantee, Cambridge Econometrics, was founded in 1978 with Stone as its first honorary president. The company continues to develop MDM and to use the model to make economic forecasts. Before retiring from Cambridge in 1980, Stone served as the President of the Royal Economic Society for 1978–1980.

== Achievements ==
Stone in 1984 received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and, later, an international scale.

While he was not the first economist to work in this field, he was the first to do so with double entry accounting. Double entry accounting basically states that every income item on one side of the balance sheet must be met by an expenditure item on the opposite side of the accounting sheet therefore creating a system of balance. This double entry system is the basis of nearly all modern accounting today. This allowed for a reliable way of tracking trade and wealth transfer on a global scale.

He is sometimes known as the &#x27;father of national income accounting&#x27;, and is the author of studies of consumer demand statistics and demand modeling, economic growth, and input-output.

During his acceptance speech Stone mentioned François Quesnay as well as the &quot;Tableau économique&quot;. Stone stated that it was one of the first works in economics to examine various sectors on such a global level and how they are all interconnected.

==Personal life==
Stone married three times. In 1936, he married Winifred Mary Jenkins who was also from Cambridge. Both of them had a passion for Economics and started a monthly paper called &quot;Trends&quot;, which was a supplement to the periodical, &quot;Industry Illustrated&quot;. It contained articles about the British economic conditions. Soon after, in 1939, he was asked to join the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The couple&#x27;s marriage dissolved in 1940.

Soon after, In 1941 Stone married his second wife Feodora Leontinoff. Feodora died in 1956.

In 1960, he married Giovanna Saffi (1919-2009), great-grandchild of Italian patriot Aurelio Saffi, who became his partner in many of his works. They collaborated for some projects in economics, for example in rewriting his book &quot;National Income and Expenditure&quot; in 1961.

==Death==
Stone died on 6 December 1991 in Cambridge, aged 78. He was survived by his third wife Giovanna, and his daughter Caroline.

<doc id="324317" wikidata="Q352867" url="?curid=324317" title="Theatrical scenery">
<text>Theatrical scenery is that which is used as a setting for a theatrical production. Scenery may be just about anything, from a single chair to an elaborately re-created street, no matter how large or how small, whether the item was custom-made or is the genuine item, appropriated for theatrical use.

==History==
The history of theatrical scenery is as old as the theatre itself, and just as obtuse and tradition bound. What we tend to think of as &#x27;traditional scenery&#x27;, i.e. two-dimensional canvas-covered &#x27;flats&#x27; painted to resemble a three-dimensional surface or vista, is a relatively recent innovation and a significant departure from the more ancient forms of theatrical expression, which tended to rely less on the actual representation of space and more on the conveyance of action and mood. By the Shakespearean era, the occasional painted backdrop or theatrical prop was in evidence, but the show itself was written so as not to rely on such items to convey itself to the audience. However, this means that today&#x27;s set designers must be that much more careful, so as to convey the setting without taking away from the actors.

==Contemporary scenery==

Our more modern notion of scenery, which dates back to the 19th century, finds its origins in the dramatic spectacle of &quot;opera buffa&quot;, from which the modern opera is descended. Its elaborate settings were appropriated by the &#x27;straight&#x27;, or dramatic, theatre, through their use in comic operettas, burlesques, pantomimes and the like. As time progressed, stage settings grew more realistic, reaching their peak in the Belasco realism of the 1910-&#x27;20s, in which complete diners, with working soda fountains and freshly made food, were recreated onstage. Perhaps as a reaction to such excess and in parallel with trends in the arts and architecture, scenery began a trend towards abstraction, although realistic settings remained in evidence, and are still used today. At the same time, the musical theatre was evolving its own set of scenic traditions, borrowing heavily from the burlesque and vaudeville style, with occasional nods to the trends of the &#x27;straight&#x27; theatre. Everything came together in the 1980s and 1990s and, continuing to today, until there is no established style of scenic production and pretty much anything goes. Modern stagecraft has grown so complex as to require the highly specialized skills of hundreds of artists and craftspeople to mount a single production.

==Types of scenery==
The construction of theatrical scenery will be frequently one of the most time-consuming tasks when preparing for a show. As a result, many theatres have a place for storing scenery (such as a loft) so that it can be used for multiple shows. Since future shows typically are not known far in advance, theatres will often construct stock scenery that can be easily adapted to fit a variety of shows. Common stock scenery types include:
* Curtains
* Flats
* Platforms
* Scenery wagons

<text>Thomas John Dempsey (January 12, 1947April 4, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL) for the New Orleans Saints, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, Houston Oilers and Buffalo Bills. Unlike the &quot;soccer style&quot; approach which was becoming more and more widely used during his career, Dempsey&#x27;s kicking style was the then-standard straight-toe style. With the Saints in 1970, he made a 63-yard field goal, setting an NFL record which stood for over 40 years.

==Early life and education==
Dempsey was born in Milwaukee and attended high school and college in Southern California. He was born with no toes on his right foot and no fingers on his right hand. To accommodate his foot structure, Dempsey wore a custom, flat-front kicking shoe that had no toe box.

==NFL career==

Dempsey was born without toes on his right foot and no fingers on his right hand. He wore a modified shoe with a flattened and enlarged toe surface. The custom made, $200 () shoe generated controversy about whether such a shoe gave a player an unfair advantage. When reporters would ask him if he thought it was unfair, he said, &quot;Unfair, eh? How &#x27;bout you try kickin&#x27; a 63 yard field goal to win it with 2 seconds left an&#x27; yer wearin&#x27; a square shoe, oh yeah, and no toes either.&quot; Additionally, ESPN &quot;Sport Science&quot; analyzed Dempsey&#x27;s kick and determined his modified shoe gave Dempsey no advantage.

The league made two rule changes in the subsequent years to discourage further long field goal attempts. The first was in 1974, which moved the goal posts from the goal line to the back of the end zone, adding ten yards to the kick distance, and awarded the ball to the defense on a missed kick at the spot where the ball was snapped. (This was changed in 1994 to the spot of the kick.) Then, in 1977, the NFL added a rule, informally known as the &quot;Tom Dempsey Rule&quot;, that &quot;any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.&quot;

===Field goal record===
Dempsey is most widely known for kicking a 63-yard field goal as time expired to give the Saints a 19–17 win over the Detroit Lions on November 8, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans. Prior to 1974, the goal posts in the NFL were on the goal lines instead of the end lines. With time running out in the game, the Saints attempted a field goal with holder Joe Scarpati spotting at the Saints&#x27; own 37-yard line. The snap from Jackie Burkett was good, and Dempsey&#x27;s kick just barely cleared the crossbar to make the try good. The win was one of only two for the Saints that season.

With the kick, Dempsey broke Bert Rechichar&#x27;s NFL record for longest field goal by seven yards. His record was tied three times—by Jason Elam with the Denver Broncos in 1998, Sebastian Janikowski with the Oakland Raiders in 2011, and David Akers with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012—before it was broken on December 8, 2013,
by Matt Prater, who hit a 64-yard field goal. On Sunday, September 26, 2021, Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens broke that record with a 66-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Detroit Lions. This walk-off kick eclipsed both Dempsey&#x27;s and Graham Gano&#x27;s 63-yarder in 2018 as the longest field goal to win a game on its final play.

Since Dempsey was the only kicker to make a field goal from more than sixty yards prior to the relocation of the goal posts, he remains the only player in NFL history to successfully kick a field goal from beyond his own team&#x27;s 40-yard line.

==Post career==

In 1983, Dempsey was inducted into the American Football Association&#x27;s Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.

After retiring from professional football, Dempsey resided with his wife Carlene, who taught history at Kehoe-France, a private school in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. His house was flooded during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

==Personal life and death==
Dempsey married Carlene and had three children, one named Ashley.

In January 2013, Dempsey revealed he had dementia. Psychiatrist Daniel Amen made the initial diagnosis of damage to Dempsey&#x27;s brain. During medical examinations and scans, Amen found three holes in the brain, along with other damage.

On March 30, 2020, Dempsey tested positive for COVID-19 during the coronavirus pandemic. He was one of 15 residents at a New Orleans senior residence to test positive for the virus. Dempsey died on April 4, due to covid.
