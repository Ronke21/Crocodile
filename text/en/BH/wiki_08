<text>The history of [[animation]], the method for creating moving pictures from still images, has an early history and a modern history that began with the advent of celluloid film in 1888. Between 1895 and 1920, during the rise of the cinematic industry, several different animation techniques were developed or re-invented, including stop-motion with objects, puppets, clay or cutouts, and drawn or painted animation. Hand-drawn animation, which mostly consisted of a succession of still images painted on cels, was the dominant technique of the 20th century and became known as traditional animation.

Today, computer animation is the dominant animation technique in most regions (hand-drawn animation continues to be very popular outside of the USA; for example, Japanese anime and European hand-drawn productions). Computer animation is mostly associated with a three-dimensional appearance with detailed shading, although many different animation styles have been generated or simulated with computers. Some productions may be recognized as Flash animations, but in practice, computer animation with a relatively two-dimensional appearance, stark outlines and little shading, will generally be considered &quot;traditional animation&quot; even if it is created on a computer. The first feature movie made on computers, without a camera, is &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), but its style can hardly be distinguished from cel animation.

==Influence of predecessors==

Animated movies are part of ancient traditions in storytelling, the visual arts and theatre. Popular techniques with moving images before film include shadow play, mechanical slides, and mobile projectors in magic lantern shows (especially phantasmagoria). Techniques with fanciful three-dimensional moving figures include masks and costumes, puppetry and automata. Illustrated children&#x27;s books, caricature, political cartoons and especially comic strips are closely related to animation, with a lot of influence on visual styles and types of humour.

The principle of modern animation is based on the stroboscopic illusion of motion that was introduced in 1833 with stroboscopic discs (better known as the phenakistiscope). These animated discs had an average of 8 to 16 images that were usually designed as endless loops, for home use as a hand-operated &quot;philosophical toy&quot;. Although several pioneers hoped it could be applied to longer scenes for theatrical use, further development of the technique throughout the 19th century mostly concentrated on combinations with the stereoscope (introduced in 1838) and photography (introduced in 1839). The breakthrough of cinematography partly depended on the novelty of a technique that was able to record and reproduce life-like motion pictures. During the first years, drawing animated pictures seemed an archaic technique in comparison, until some artists produced popular and influential animated shorts and producers embraced cheap techniques to turn popular comic strips into animated cartoons.

==1888–1909: Earliest animations on film==
===Théâtre Optique===
Charles-Émile Reynaud developed his projection praxinoscope into the Théâtre Optique with transparent hand-painted colorful pictures on a long perforated strip wound between two spools, which he patented in December 1888. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to over 500,000 visitors at the Musée Grévin in Paris. His &quot;Pantomimes Lumineuses&quot; series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. A background scene was projected separately. Piano music, song and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. The first program included three cartoons: &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot; (created in 1892), &quot;Un bon bock&quot; (created in 1892, now lost), and &quot;Le Clown et ses chiens&quot; (created in 1892, now lost). Later, the titles &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine &quot; (created in 1894) and &quot;A rêve au coin du feu&quot; (created in 1894) would be part of the performances.

===Standard picture film===
Despite the success of Reynaud&#x27;s films, it took some time before animation was adapted in the film industry that came about after the introduction of Lumiere&#x27;s Cinematograph in 1895. Georges Méliès&#x27; early fantasy films and trick films (released between 1896 and 1913) occasionally contain elements that somewhat resemble animation, including painted props or painted creatures that were moved in front of painted backgrounds (mostly using wires), and film colorization by hand. Méliès also popularized the stop trick, with a single change made to the scene in between shots, that had already been used in Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;The Execution of Mary Stuart&quot; in 1895 and probably led to the development of stop-motion animation some years later. It was not until 1906 that proper animated films appeared in cinemas. The dating of some presumed earlier films with animation is contested, while other early films that might have used stop motion or other animation techniques are lost or unidentified.

====Printed animation film====

By 1897, German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing had a first prototype of their toy &quot;kinematograph&quot;, which they presented at a toy convention in Leipzig in November 1898. Soon after, other toy manufacturers in Germany and France, including Ernst Plank, Georges Carette, and Lapierre, started selling similar devices. The &quot;kinematographs&quot; were basically traditional toy magic lanterns, adapted with one or two small spools that used standard &quot;Edison perforation&quot; 35mm film, a crank, and a shutter. These projectors were intended for the same type of &quot;home entertainment&quot; toy market that most of the manufacturers already provided with praxinoscopes and magic lanterns. Apart from relatively expensive live-action films, the manufacturers produced many cheaper films by printing lithographed drawings. These animations were probably made in black-and-white starting in 1898 or 1899, but by 1902 at the latest they were produced in color. The pictures were often traced from live-action films (like the later rotoscoping technique). These very short films typically depicted a simple repetitive action and most were designed to be projected as a loop - playing endlessly with the ends of the film joined. The lithograph process and the loop format follow the tradition that was set by the stroboscopic disc, zoetrope and praxinoscope.

&quot;Katsudō Shashin&quot; (produced between 1907 and 1912), is speculated to be the oldest work of animation in Japan and it was probably made in imitation of similar Western printed film strips.

====J. Stuart Blackton====

J. Stuart Blackton was a British-American filmmaker, co-founder of the Vitagraph Studios, and one of the first to use animation in his films. His &quot;The Enchanted Drawing&quot; (1900) can be regarded as the first theatrical film recorded on standard picture film that included animated elements, although this concerns just a few frames of changes in drawings. It shows Blackton doing &quot;lightning sketches&quot; of a face, cigars, a bottle of wine and a glass. The face changes expression when Blackton pours wine into the face&#x27;s mouth and when Blackton takes his cigar. The technique used in this film was basically the stop trick: the single change to the scenes was the replacement of a drawing by a similar drawing with a different facial expression. In some scenes, a drawn bottle and glass were replaced by real objects. Blackton had possibly used the same technique in a lost 1896 lightning sketch film.

Blackton&#x27;s 1906 film &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot; is often regarded as the oldest known hand-drawn animation on standard film. It features a sequence made with blackboard drawings that are changed between frames to show two faces changing expressions and some billowing cigar smoke, as well as two sequences that feature cutout animation with a similar look for more fluid motion.

====Alexander Shiryaev====
Alexander Shiryaev was a Russian ballet dancer, ballet master, and choreographer who served at the Mariinsky Theatre who is credited with the independent invention of stop motion animation. From 1906 to 1909, he created the earliest known animated films made in Russia, using puppet animation, hand-drawn animation, and mixed techniques. While some were made as experiments (for example, a 20-minute drawn animation showing the flight of birds in a continuous line), most of his films were made for the educational purpose of showing ballet dancers what their choreography should look like. The puppet animations ranged in length from just over a minute to 10 minutes long. Shiryaev&#x27;s films were only screened within the Mariinsky Theatre for the performers, not publicly, and were generally unknown until 2003, when Russian documentarist and ballet historian Viktor Bocharov released a one-hour movie titled &quot;A Belated Premiere&quot; which included fragments of the various films.

====Segundo de Chomón====
Spanish filmmaker Segundo de Chomón made many trick films for French film company Pathé. By 1906, he had used stop motion in several short films, including &quot;La Maison ensorcelée&quot; and &quot;Le théâtre de Bob&quot; (both released in the US in April 1906). Blackton&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; (23 February 1907) contains stop motion elements that are very similar to those in &quot;La Maison ensorcelée&quot;. If the release dates are correct (and if translated titles have not been mixed up), Blackton must have been inspired by De Chomón&#x27;s work rather than vice versa, but it has been believed that &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; was a big hit in France and other European countries, and would have been the film that inspired local filmmakers, including Émile Cohl, to start working with the innovative animation technique. De Chomon also made the related short film &quot;Hôtel électrique&quot; (1908), which includes a short scene with pixilation.

====Émile Cohl====

In 1907, the French artist Émile Cohl started his filmmaking career with &quot;Japon de faintasie&quot;, with imaginative use of stop motion techniques. His next short can be regarded as the first animated film using what would come to be known as traditional animation methods: the 1908 &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot;. The film largely consists of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There are also sections of live action where the animator&#x27;s hands enters the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film, which gave the picture a blackboard look. Cohl later went to Fort Lee, New Jersey near New York City in 1912, where he worked for French studio Éclair and spread its animation technique to the US.

==1910s: From original artists to &quot;assembly-line&quot; production studios==
During the 1910s larger-scale animation studios come into being and solo artists faded from the public eye. The first known professional female animator, Bessie Mae Kelley, began her career in 1917.

===Winsor McCay===

Starting with a short 1911 film of his most popular character &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, successful newspaper cartoonist Winsor McCay gave much more detail to his hand-drawn animations than any animation previously seen in cinemas. His 1914 film &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; featured an early example of character development in drawn animation. It was also the first film to combine live-action footage with animation. Originally, McCay used the film in his vaudeville act: he would stand next to the screen and speak to Gertie who would respond with a series of gestures. At the end of the film McCay would walk behind the projection screen, seamlessly being replaced with a prerecorded image of himself entering the screen, getting on the cartoon dinosaur&#x27;s back and riding out of frame. McCay personally hand-drew almost every one of the thousands of drawings for his films. Other noteworthy titles by McCay are &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; (1918).

=== Cartoon Film Company – Buxton and Dyer ===
Between 1915 and 1916 Dudley Buxton and Anson Dyer produced a series of 26 topical cartoons, during WWI, mainly utilising cutout animation, which they released as &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Animated Sketchbook&quot;, The episodes included events such as the shelling of Scarborough by German battleships, and the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in episode No.4 in June 1915.

===Barré Studio===
Around 1913 Raoul Barré developed the peg system that made it easier to align drawings by perforating two holes below each drawing and placing them on two fixed pins. He also used a &quot;slash and tear&quot; technique to not have to draw the complete background or other motionless parts for every frame. The parts where something needed to be changed for the next frame were carefully cut away from the drawing and filled in with the required change on the sheet below. After Barré had started his career in animation at Edison Studios, he founded one of the first film studios dedicated to animation in 1914 (initially together with Bill Nolan). Barré Studio had success with the production of the adaptation of the popular comic strip &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; (1916–1926). The studio employed several animators who would go on to have notable careers in animation, including Frank Moser, Gregory La Cava, Vernon Stallings, and Pat Sullivan.

===Bray Productions===
In 1914, John Bray opened John Bray Studios, which revolutionized the way animation was created. Earl Hurd, one of Bray&#x27;s employees, patented the cel technique. This involved animating moving objects on transparent celluloid sheets. Animators photographed the sheets over a stationary background image to generate the sequence of images. This, as well as Bray&#x27;s innovative use of the assembly-line method, allowed John Bray Studios to create Colonel Heeza Liar, the first animated series. Many aspiring cartoonists started their careers at Bray, including Paul Terry (later of Heckle and Jeckle fame), Max Fleischer (later of Betty Boop and Popeye fame), and Walter Lantz (later of Woody Woodpecker fame). The cartoon studio operated from until 1928. Some of the first cartoon stars from the Bray studios were Farmer Alfalfa (by Paul Terry) and Bobby Bumps (by Earl Hurd).

===Hearst&#x27;s International Film Service===

Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst founded International Film Service in 1916. Hearst lured most of Barré Studio&#x27;s animators away, with Gregory La Cava becoming the head of the studio. They produced adaptations of many comic strips from Heart&#x27;s newspapers in a rather limited fashion, giving just a little motion to the characters while mainly using the dialog balloons to deliver the story. The most notable series is &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, probably the first of many anthropomorphic cartoon cat characters and other talking animals. Before the studio stopped in 1918, it had employed some new talents, including Vernon Stallings, Ben Sharpsteen, Jack King, John Foster, Grim Natwick, Burt Gillett and Isadore Klein.

===Rotoscoping===
In 1915, Max Fleischer applied for a patent, which was granted in 1917, for a technique which became known as rotoscoping: the process of using live-action film recordings as a reference point to more easily create realistic animated movements. The technique was often used in the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series by John Bray Studios (and others). The series resulted from experimental rotoscoped images of Max&#x27;s brother, Dave Fleischer, performing as a clown, which evolved into the character who would become known as Koko the Clown.

===Felix the Cat===

In 1919, Otto Messmer of Pat Sullivan Studios created Felix the Cat. Pat Sullivan, the studio head, took all of the credit for Felix, a common practice in the early days of studio animation. Felix the Cat was distributed by Paramount Studios and attracted a large audience, eventually becoming one of the most recognized cartoon characters in film history. Felix was the first cartoon to be merchandised.

===Quirino Cristiani: the first animated features===
The first known animated feature film was &quot;El Apóstol&quot; by Quirino Cristiani, released on 9 November 1917 in Argentina. This successful 70-minute satire utilized a cardboard cutout technique, reportedly with 58,000 frames at 14 frames per second. Cristiani&#x27;s next feature Sin dejar rastros was released in 1918, but it received no press coverage and poor public attendance before it was confiscated by the police for diplomatic reasons. None of Cristiani&#x27;s feature films have survived.

==1920s: Absolute film, synchronized sound and the rise of Disney==
A number of key events occurred in the 1920s, including the development of the first animations with synchronized sound, and the founding of the Walt Disney Studio. The decade also saw the first appearance of Mickey Mouse in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928).

===Absolute film===

In the early 1920s, the absolute film movement with artists such as Walter Ruttmann, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling and Oskar Fischinger made short abstract animations which proved influential. Although some later abstract animation works by, for instance, Len Lye and Norman McLaren would be widely appreciated, the genre largely remained a relatively obscure avant-garde art form, while direct influences or similar ideas would occasionally pop up in mainstream animation like in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor&quot; in &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), which Fischinger originally collaborated on until his work was scrapped, and which was partly inspired by the works of Lye or the later movie &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; (1965) by Chuck Jones.

===Early synchronized sound: &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; and &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Sound Fables&quot;===
From May 1924 to September 1926, Dave and Max Fleischer&#x27;s Inkwell Studios produced 19 sound cartoons, part of the &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; series, using the Phonofilm &quot;sound-on-film&quot; process. The series also introduced the &quot;bouncing ball&quot; above lyrics to guide audiences to sing along to the music. &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; from June 1926 was probably the first film to feature a bit of synchronized animated dialogue, with an early version of Bimbo mouthing the words &quot;Follow the ball, and join in, everybody&quot;. The Bimbo character was further developed in Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Talkartoons&quot; (1929–1932).

Paul Terry&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Time&quot;, from his &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (1921–1936) series, premiered on 1 September 1928 with a synchronized soundtrack that contained dialogue. Terry was urged to add the novelty against his wishes by the new studio owner Van Beuren. Although the series and its main character Farmer Al Falfa had been popular, audiences were not impressed by this first episode with sound.

===Lotte Reiniger===
The earliest surviving animated feature film is the 1926 silhouette-animated &quot;Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (Adventures of Prince Achmed)&quot;, which used colour-tinted film. It was directed by German Lotte Reiniger and her husband Carl Koch. Walter Ruttmann created visual background effects. French/Hungarian collaborator Berthold Bartosch or Reiniger created depth of field by putting scenographic elements and figures on several levels of glass plates with illumination from below and the camera vertically above. Later, a similar technique became the basis for the multiplane camera.

===Early Disney: Laugh-O-Grams, Julius, Alice, Oswald and Mickey===
Between 1920 and 1922, cartoonists Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks and Fred Harman worked at the Slide Company (soon renamed to Kansas City Film Ad Company), which produced cutout animation commercials. Disney started experimenting with drawn animation techniques in his parents&#x27; garage and managed to sell a series that satirized current local topics to the owner of the three local Newman Theatres as weekly &quot;Newman Laugh-O-Grams&quot; in 1921. With his short-lived own company Laugh-O-Gram Films, Inc., Disney, together with Iwerks, Fred&#x27;s brother Hugh Harman, Rudolph Ising and Carman Maxwell produced a series of circa seven-minute modernized fairy tale cartoons, inspired by Terry&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;. The studio went bankrupt in 1923, but had already made the unsold 12-minute film &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, featuring a live-action girl (Virginia Davis) interacting with numerous cartoon characters, including the Felix-inspired Julius the Cat (who had already appeared in the Laugh-O-Gram fairy tales without a name). When Disney moved to Hollywood, he managed to close a deal with New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler, who had just lost the rights to Felix the Cat and &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot;. To make the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; series (1923–1927), Iwerks also moved to Hollywood, later followed by Ising, Harman, Maxwell, and Film Ad colleague Friz Freleng. The series was successful enough to last 57 episodes, but Disney eventually preferred to create a new fully animated series. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit followed in 1927 and was a hit, but after failed negotiations for continuation in 1928, Charles Mintz took direct control of production and Disney lost his character and most of his staff to Mintz.
Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse in 1928 to replace Oswald. A first film entitled &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; failed to impress a test audience and did not raise sufficient interest of potential distributors. After some live-action movies with synchronized sound had become successful, Disney put the new Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; on hold to start work on a special sound production which would launch the series more convincingly. Much of the action in the resulting &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (November 1928) involves the making of sounds, for instance Mickey uses livestock aboard the boat as musical instruments. The film became a huge success and Mickey Mouse would soon become the most popular cartoon character in history.

===Bosko===
Bosko was created in 1927 by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, specifically with talkies in mind. They were still working for Disney at the time, but they left in 1928 to work on the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons at Universal for about a year, and then they produced &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot; pilot in May 1929 to shop for a distributor. They signed with Leon Schlesinger Productions and started the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series for Warner Bros. in 1930. Bosko was the star of 39 Warner Bros. cartoons before Harman and Ising took Bosko to MGM after leaving Warner Bros. After two MGM cartoons, the character received a dramatic make-over that was much less appreciated by audiences. Bosko&#x27;s career ended in 1938.

==1930s: Color, depth, cartoon superstars and &quot;Snow White&quot;==
While the global economy suffered under the Great Depression through the 1930s, animation continued to flourish. Early color processes came into use, along with the use of the multiplane camera. In 1937, &quot;Snow White&quot; debuted in theatres—the first full-length traditionally animated feature film.

===Two-strip color===
The multi-colored lithograph technique of the early European animated film loops for home use seems not to have been applied to theatrically release animated films. While the original prints of &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; featured film tinting, most theatrically released animated films before 1930 were black and white. Effective color processes thus were a welcome innovation in Hollywood and seemed especially suitable for cartoons.

A cartoon segment in the feature film &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (April 1930), made by Walter Lantz and Bill Nolan, was the first animation presented in two-strip Technicolor.

&quot;Fiddlesticks&quot;, released together with &quot;King of Jazz&quot;, was the first Flip the Frog film and the first project Ub Iwerks worked on after he left Disney to set up his studio. In England, the cartoon was released in Harris Color, a two-color process, probably as the first theatrically released standalone animated cartoon to boast both sound and color.

===Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; in Technicolor===
When the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series, started in 1929, was less popular than Disney had hoped, he turned to new technological innovation to improve the impact of the series. In 1932 he worked with the Technicolor company to create the first full-color animation &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, debuting the three-strip technique (the first use in live-action movies came about two years later). The cartoon was successful and won an Academy Award for Short Subjects, Cartoons. Disney temporarily had a deal for the exclusive use of Technicolor&#x27;s full-color technique in animated films. He even waited before producing the ongoing Mickey Mouse series in color, so the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; would have their special appeal to audiences. After the exclusivity deal lapsed in September 1935, full-color animation soon became the industry standard.

&quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; inspired many cartoon series that boasted various other color systems until Technicolor was not exclusive to Disney anymore, including Ub Iwerks&#x27; ComiColor Cartoons (1933–1936), Van Beuren Studios&#x27; &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot; (1934–1936), Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Color Classics&quot; (1934–1941), Charles Mintz&#x27;s &quot;Color Rhapsody&quot; (1936–1949), MGM&#x27;s &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; (1934–1938) George Pal&#x27;s &quot;Puppetoons&quot; (1932–1948), and Walter Lantz&#x27;s &quot;Swing Symphony&quot; (1941–1945).

===Multiplane cameras and the stereopticon process===

Several techniques were developed to create the impression of depth. The most common technique was to have characters move between several layers that could be moved independently, corresponding to the laws of perspective (e.g. the further away from the camera, the slower the speed).

Lotte Reiniger had already designed a type of multiplane camera for &quot;Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed&quot; and her collaborator Berthold Bartosch used a similar setup for his intricately detailed 25-minute film &quot;L&#x27;Idée&quot; (1932).

In 1933, Ub Iwerks developed a multiplane camera and used it for several &quot;Willie Whopper&quot; (1933–1934) and &quot;ComiColor Cartoons&quot; episodes.
The Fleischers developed the very different stereopticon process in 1933 for their &quot;Color Classics&quot;. It was used in the first episode &quot;Betty Boop in Poor Cinderella&quot; (1934) and most of the following episodes. The process involved three-dimensional sets built and sculpted on a large turntable. The photographed cells were placed within the movable set so that the animated characters would appear to move in front and behind the 3D elements within the scene when the turntable was made to rotate.

Disney employee William Garity developed a multiplane camera that could have up to seven layers of artwork. It was tested in the Academy Award-winning &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; episode &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937) and used prominently in &quot;Snow White&quot; and later features.

===New colorful cartoon superstars===
After the additions of sound and color were a huge success for Disney, other studios followed. By the end of the decade, almost all the theatrical cartoons were produced in full color.

Initially, music and songs were the focus of many series, as indicated by titles such as &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot;, &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, but it was the recognizable characters that stuck with audiences. Mickey Mouse was the first cartoon superstar who surpassed Felix the Cat&#x27;s popularity, but soon dozens of cartoon superstars followed, many remaining popular for decades.

Warner Bros. had a vast music library that could be used in cartoons, and inspired many cartoons as well, while Disney needed to create the music for every cartoon. Leon Schlesinger sold Warner Bros. a second series called &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, which until 1939 contractually needed to contain at least one refrain from the music catalog. Unlike &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; with Bosko, Merrie Melodies only featured a few recurring characters like Foxy, Piggy and Goopy Geer before Harman and Ising left in 1933. Bosko was replaced with Buddy for the Looney Tunes series, but he lasted only two years, while &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; continued without recurring characters. Eventually, the two series became indistinguishable and produced many new characters that became popular. Animator/director Bob Clampett designed Porky Pig (1935) and Daffy Duck (1937) and was responsible for much of the energetic animation and irreverent humor associated with the series. The 1930s also saw early anonymous incarnations of characters who would later become Elmer Fudd (1937/1940) and Bugs Bunny (1938/1940). Beginning in 1937, Mel Blanc performed most of the characters&#x27; voices.

Disney introduced new characters to the Mickey Mouse universe who would become very popular, including Minnie Mouse (1928), Pluto (1930), Goofy (1932), and a character who would soon become the public&#x27;s new favorite: Donald Duck (1934). Disney also realized that the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories; he developed a &quot;story department&quot; where storyboard artists separate from animators would focus on developing the story alone, which proved its worth when Disney studio released, in 1933, the first animated short to feature well-developed characters: &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;. Disney kept on expanding his studio and started more and more production activities, including comics, merchandise, and theme parks. Most projects were based on the characters developed for theatrical short films.

Fleischer Studios introduced an unnamed dog character as Bimbo&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;Dizzy Dishes&quot; (1930), who evolved into the human female Betty Boop (1930–1939) and became Fleischer&#x27;s best-known creation. In the 1930s they also added Hunky and Spunky (1938) and the popular animated adaptation of Popeye (1933) to their repertoire.

===Hays code and Betty Boop===
Hays&#x27; Motion Picture Production Code for moral guidelines was applied in 1930 and rigidly enforced between 1934 and 1968. It had a big impact on filmmakers who had liked to create relatively saucy material. An infamous example, Betty Boop suffered greatly when she had to be changed from a carefree flapper with an innocent sex appeal into a more wholesome and much tamer character wearing a fuller dress. Her boyfriend Bimbo&#x27;s disappearance was probably also the result of the Code&#x27;s disapproval of mixed-species relationships.

===&quot;Snow White&quot; and the breakthrough of the animated feature===
At least eight animated feature films were released before Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, while at least another two earlier animated feature projects remained unfinished. Most of these films (of which only four survive) were made using cutout, silhouette or stop-motion techniques. Among the lost animated features were three features by Quirino Cristiani, who premiered his third feature &quot;Peludópolis&quot; on 18 September 1931 in Buenos Aires with a Vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronized soundtrack. It was received quite positively by critics, but did not become a hit and was an economic fiasco for the filmmaker. Cristiani soon realized that he could no longer make a career with animation in Argentina. The only other feature film, &quot;Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons&quot;—also by Disney—was hand-drawn. It was released seven months before &quot;Snow White&quot; to promote that movie&#x27;s upcoming release. Many do not consider the &quot;Review&quot; a genuine feature film, because it is a package film and lasts only 41 minutes. It does meet the official definitions of a feature film by the British Film Institute, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the American Film Institute, which require that the film has to be over 40 minutes long.

When it became known that Disney was working on a feature-length animation, critics regularly referred to the project as &quot;Disney&#x27;s folly&quot;, believing that audiences could not stand the expected bright colors and jokes for such a long time. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; premiered on 21 December 1937 and became a worldwide success.

The Fleischer studios followed Disney&#x27;s example with &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; in 1939, which was a minor success at the box office.

===Early TV animation===
In April 1938, when about 50 television sets were connected, NBC aired the eight-minute low-budget cartoon &quot;Willie the Worm&quot;. It was specially made for this broadcast by former Disney employee Chad Grothkopf, mainly with cutouts and a bit of cel animation. About a year later, on 3 May 1939, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Donald&#x27;s Cousin Gus&quot; was premiered on NBC&#x27;s experimental W2XBS channel, a few weeks before the short cartoon was released in movie theaters, as part of the first full-evening program.

==1940s: Feature films and the rise of television==

===Wartime propaganda===
Several governments had already used animation in public information films, like those by the GPO Film Unit in the U.K. and Japanese educational films. During World War II, animation became a common medium for propaganda. The US government contracted its best studios to work for the war effort.

To instruct service personnel about all kinds of military subjects and to boost morale, Warner Bros. was contracted for several shorts and the special animated series &quot;Private Snafu&quot;. The character was created by the famous movie director Frank Capra, Dr. Seuss was involved in screenwriting and the series was directed by Chuck Jones. Disney also produced several instructive shorts and even personally financed the feature-length &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot; (1943) that promoted the idea of long-range bombing.

Many popular characters promoted war bonds, like Bugs Bunny in &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot;, Disney&#x27;s little pigs in &quot;The Thrifty Pig&quot; and a whole bunch of Disney characters in &quot;All Together&quot;. Daffy Duck asked for scrap metal for the war effort in &quot;Scrap Happy Daffy&quot;. Minnie Mouse and Pluto invited civilians to collect their cooking grease so it could be used for making explosives in &quot;Out of the Frying Pan Into the Firing Line&quot;. There were several more political propaganda short films, like Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Fifth Column Mouse&quot;, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Little&quot; and the more serious &quot;Education for Death&quot; and &quot;Reason and Emotion&quot; (nominated for an Academy Award).

Such wartime films were very appreciated. Bugs Bunny became something of a national icon and Disney&#x27;s propaganda short &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; (starring Donald Duck) won the company its tenth Academy Award for cartoon short subjects.

Japan&#x27;s first feature-length animated film, &quot;&quot;, was made in 1944, under orders of the Ministry of the Navy of Japan. It was designed for children and, partly inspired by &quot;Fantasia&quot;, was meant to inspire dreams and hope for peace. The main characters are an anthropomorphic monkey, dog, bear, and pheasant who become parachute troopers (except the pheasant who becomes a pilot) tasked with invading the island of Celebes. An epilogue hints at America being the target for the next generation.

===Feature animation in the 1940s===
====High ambitions, setbacks, and cutbacks in US feature animation====

Disney&#x27;s next two features (&quot;Pinocchio&quot; and the very ambitious concert film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, both released in 1940) and Fleischer Studios&#x27; second animated feature &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; (1941/1942) were all received favorably by critics, but failed at the box office during their initial theatrical runs. The primary cause was that World War II had cut off most foreign markets. These setbacks discouraged most companies that had plans for animated features.

Disney cut back on costs for the next features and first released &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, mostly consisting of a live-action tour of the new studio in Burbank, partly in black and white, with four short cartoons. It was a mild success at the worldwide box office and was followed only a few months later by &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), animated in a relatively simple style and only 64 minutes long. The limited length and economically efficient techniques helped the movie make a profit at the box office, and critics and audiences reacted positively. Disney&#x27;s next feature &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) returned to a larger budget and a lavish style, but the more dramatic story, darker mood, and lack of fantasy elements were not well-received during its initial run and the movie lost money at the box office.

Although all the other eight Disney features of the 1940s were package films, or combinations with live-action (for instance &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944)), Disney kept faith in animated features. Only a few other American animation studios managed to release more than a handful of features before the 1990s.

====Non-US animation forces====
American cel-animated films dominated the worldwide production and consumption of theatrical animated releases since the 1920s. Disney&#x27;s work especially proved to be very popular and influential around the world. Studios from other countries could hardly compete with American productions so many animation producers outside the US chose to work with techniques other than cel animation, such as puppet animation or cut-out animation. However, several countries (most notably Russia, China, and Japan) developed their own relatively large &quot;traditional&quot; animation industries. Russia&#x27;s Soyuzmultfilm animation studio, founded in 1936, employed up to 700 skilled workers and, during the Soviet period, produced 20 films per year on average. Some titles that were noticed outside their respective domestic markets include &quot;铁扇公主 (Princess Iron Fan)&quot; (China 1941, influential in Japan), &quot;Конёк-Горбуно́к (The Humpbacked Horse)&quot; (Russia 1947, winner special jury award in Cannes in 1950), &quot;I Fratelli Dynamite (The Dynamite Brothers)&quot; (Italy 1949) and &quot;La Rosa di Bagdad (The Rose of Baghdad)&quot; (Italy 1949, the 1952 English dub starred Julie Andrews).

===Successful theatrical short cartoons of the 1940s===

During the &quot;Golden Age of American animation&quot;, new studios competed with the studios that survived the sound and color innovation battles of the previous decades. Cartoon animals were still the norm and music was still a relevant element, but often lost its main stage appeal to Disney&#x27;s melodramatic storytelling or the wild humor in Looney Tunes and other cartoons.

Disney continued their cartoon successes, adding Daisy Duck (1937/1940) and Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale (1943/1947) to the Mickey Mouse universe, while Warner Bros. developed new characters to join their popular Merrie Melodies/Looney Tunes cast, including Tweety, Henery Hawk (both in 1942), Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam (all in 1945), Foghorn Leghorn, Barnyard Dawg, Gossamer (all in 1946), Marvin the Martian (1948), and Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner (1949).

Other new popular characters and series were Terrytoons&#x27; Mighty Mouse (1942–1961) and Heckle and Jeckle (1946–1966), and Screen Gems&#x27; The Fox and the Crow (1941–1950).

====Fleischer/Famous Studios====
Fleischer launched its spectacular Superman adaptation in 1941. The success came too late to save the studio from its financial problems and in 1942 Paramount Pictures took over the studio from the resigning Fleischer Brothers. The studio which was renamed to Famous Studios continued the &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; series, developed popular adaptations of Little Lulu (1943–1948, licensed by Gold Key Comics), Casper, the Friendly Ghost (1945) and created new series, such as Little Audrey (1947–1958) and Baby Huey (1950–1959).

====Walter Lantz Productions====
Walter Lantz started his animation career at Hearst&#x27;s studio at the age of 16. He had also worked for the Bray Studios and Universal Pictures, where he had gained control over the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons in 1929 (reportedly by winning the character and control of the studio in a poker bet with Universal president Carl Laemmle). In 1935, the Universal studio was turned into the independent Walter Lantz Productions, but remained on the Universal lot and continued to produce cartoons for Universal to distribute. When Oswald&#x27;s popularity dwindled and the character was eventually retired in 1938, Lantz&#x27;s productions went without successful characters until he developed Andy Panda in 1939. The anthropomorphic panda starred in over two dozen cartoons until 1949, but he was soon overshadowed by the iconic Woody Woodpecker, who debuted in the Andy Panda cartoon &quot;Knock Knock&quot; in 1940. Other popular Lantz characters include Wally Walrus (1944), Buzz Buzzard (1948), Chilly Willy (1953), Hickory, Dickory, and Doc (1959).

====MGM====
After distributing Ub Iwerks&#x27; &quot;Flip the Frog&quot; and &quot;Willie Whopper&quot; cartoons and &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; by Harman and Ising, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer founded its own cartoon studio in 1937. The studio had much success with Barney Bear (1939–1954), Hanna and Joseph Barbera&#x27;s Tom and Jerry (1940) and Spike and Tyke (1942).

In 1941, Tex Avery left Warner Bros. for MGM and created Droopy (1943), Screwy Squirrel (1944) and George and Junior (1944) there.

====UPA====
While Disney and most of the other studios sought a sense of depth and realism in animation, UPA animators (including former Disney employee John Hubley) had a different artistic vision. They developed a much sparser and more stylized type of animation, inspired by Russian examples. The studio was formed in 1943 and initially worked on government contracts. A few years later they signed a contract with Columbia Pictures, took over &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; from Screen Gems, and earned Oscar nominations for their first two theatrical shorts in 1948 and 1949. While the field of animation was dominated by anthropomorphic animals at the time when the studio was allowed to create a new character, they came up with the near-sighted old man. Mr. Magoo (1949) became a hit and would be featured in many short films. Between 1949 and 1959, UPA received 15 Oscar nominations, winning their first Academy Award with the Dr. Seuss adaptation &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; (1950), followed by two more for &quot;When Magoo Flew&quot; (1954) and &quot;Magoo&#x27;s Puddle Jumper&quot; (1956). The distinctive style was influential and even affected the big studios, including Warner Bros. and Disney. Apart from effective freedom in artistic expression, UPA had proved that sparser animation could be appreciated as much as (or even more than) the expensive lavish styles.

===TV animation in the 1940s===

The back catalog of animated cartoons from many studios, originally produced for a short theatrical run, proved very valuable for television broadcasting. &quot;Movies for Small Fry&quot; (1947), presented by &quot;big brother&quot; Bob Emery on Tuesday evenings on the New York WABD-TV channel, was one of the first TV series for children and featured many classic Van Beuren Studios cartoons. It was continued on the DuMont Television Network as the daily show &quot;Small Fry Club&quot; (1948–1951) with a live audience in a studio setting.

Many classical series from Walter Lantz, Warner Bros., Terrytoons, MGM, and Disney similarly found a new life in TV shows for children, with many reruns, for decades. Instead of studio settings and live-action presentations, some shows would feature new animation to present or string together the older cartoons.

The earliest American animated series specifically produced for TV came about in 1949, with &quot;Adventures of Pow Wow&quot; (43 five-minute episodes broadcast on Sunday mornings from January to November) and &quot;Jim and Judy in Teleland&quot; (52 episodes, later also sold to Venezuela and Japan).

== 1950s: Shift from classic theatrical cartoons to limited animation in TV series for children==

Most theatrical cartoons had been produced for non-specific audiences. Dynamic action and gags with talking animals in clear drawing styles and bright colors were naturally appealing to young children, but the cartoons regularly contained violence and sexual innuendo and were often screened together with newsreels and feature films that were not for children. On US television, cartoons were mainly programmed for children, in convenient time slots on weekend mornings, weekday afternoons, or early evenings.

The scheduling constraints of the 1950s American TV animation process, and notable issues of resource management (higher quantity needed to be made in less time for a lower budget compared to theatrical animation), led to the development of various techniques now known as limited animation. The sparser type of animation which originally had been an artistic choice of style for UPA was embraced as a means to cut back production time and costs. Full-frame animation (&quot;on ones&quot;) became rare in the United States, outside its use for a decreasing amount of theatrical productions. Chuck Jones coined the term &quot;illustrated radio&quot; to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals. Some producers also found that limited animation looked better than the fully animated styles on the small black-and-white TV screens of the time.

===Animated TV series of the 1950s===
Jay Ward produced the popular &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; (tested in 1948, original broadcasts in 1949–1952 and 1957–1959), with the successful use of a limited-animation style.

At the end of the 1950s, several studios dedicated to TV animation production started competing. While the focus for competition in theatrical animation had been on quality and innovation, it now shifted to delivering animation quickly and cheaply. Critics noted how the quality of many shows was often poor in comparison to classic cartoons, with rushed animation and run-of-the-mill stories. Network executives were satisfied as long as there were enough viewers, and the huge amounts of young viewers were not bothered with the lack of quality that the critics perceived. Watching Saturday-morning cartoon programming, up to four hours long, became a favorite pastime of most American children in mid-1960s, and was a mainstay for decades.

Disney had entered into TV production relatively early, but for a long time refrained from creating new animated series. Instead, Disney had their anthology series on the air since 1954 in prime time three-hour slots, starting with the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot; series (1954–1958), clearly promoting the Disneyland theme park that opened in 1955. Walt Disney personally hosted the series that –apart from older cartoons– featured segments with looks behind the scenes at film-making processes or with new live-action adventures among others.

William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (the creators of Tom and Jerry) continued as Hanna-Barbera after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer closed their animation studio in 1957 when MGM considered their back catalog sufficient for further sales. While Hanna-Barbera only made one theatrically released series with &quot;Loopy de Loop&quot; (1959–1965), they proved to be the most prolific and successful producers of animated television series for several decades. Starting with &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot; (1957–1960), they continued with successful series like &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; (1958, the first half-hour television program to feature only animation) and &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; (1959–1961).

Other notable programs include UPA&#x27;s &quot;Gerald McBoing Boing&quot; (1956–1957), Soundac&#x27;s &quot;Colonel Bleep&quot; (1957–1960, the first animated TV series in color), Terrytoons&#x27;s &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; (1958), and Jay Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; (1959–1964).

In contrast to the international film market (developed during the silent era when language problems were limited to title cards), TV-pioneering in most countries (often connected to radio broadcasting) focused on the domestic production of live programs. Rather than importing animated series that usually would have to be dubbed, children&#x27;s programming could more easily and more cheaply be produced in other ways (for instance, featuring puppetry). One notable method was the real-time &quot;animation&quot; of cutout figures in &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; (1957) on the BBC. One of the few early animated series for TV that was seen outside of the country of production was Belvision Studios&#x27; &quot;Les Aventures de Tintin, d&#x27;après Hergé (Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin)&quot; (Belgium 1957–1964, directed by Ray Goossens), broadcast by the BBC in 1962 and syndicated in the United States from 1963 to 1971.

===Theatrical short cartoons in the 1950s===
Warner Bros. introduced new characters Granny, Sylvester Jr. (both in 1950), Speedy Gonzales, Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog (all three in 1953), and Tasmanian Devil (1954).

===Theatrical feature animation in the 1950s===
====Disney====
After a string of package features and live-action/animation combos, Disney returned to fully animated feature films with &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1950 (the first since &quot;Bambi&quot;). Its success practically saved the company from bankruptcy. It was followed by &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), which flopped at the box office and initially received negative reviews. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953) and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955) were hits. The ambitious, much delayed, and more expensive &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959) lost money at the box office and caused doubts about the future of Walt Disney&#x27;s animation department. Like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and most of Disney&#x27;s flops, it would later be commercially successful through re-releases and would eventually be regarded as a true classic.

==1960s: Animated TV shows and the rise of anime==

===US animated TV series and specials in the 1960s===
Total Television was founded in 1959 to promote General Mills products with original cartoon characters in Cocoa Puffs commercials (1960–1969) and the General Mills-sponsored TV series &quot;King Leonardo and His Short Subjects&quot; (1960–1963, repackaged shows until 1969), &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; (1963–1966, repackaged shows until 1972), &quot;The Underdog Show&quot; (1964–1967, repackaged shows until 1973) and &quot;The Beagles&quot; (1966–1967). Animation for all of these series was produced at Gamma Studios in Mexico. Total Television stopped producing after 1969 when General Mills no longer wanted to sponsor them.

Many of the American animated TV series from the 1960s to 1980s were based on characters and formats that had already proved popular in other media. UPA produced &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot; (1961–1962), based on comic books. Filmation, active from 1962 to 1989, created few original characters, but many adaptations of DC Comics, live-action TV series (including &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Rescue Rangers&quot; (1973–1975) and &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;), some live-action features (including &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1967–1969), and more). Grantray-Lawrence Animation was the first studio to adapt Marvel Comics superheroes in 1966. Pop groups got animated versions in &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1965–1966) and Rankin/Bass&#x27;s &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot; (1971–1972) and &quot;The Osmonds&quot; (1972). Hanna-Barbera turned comedians into cartoon characters with &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot; (1966–1967) and &quot;The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show&quot; (1967–1968). Format Films&#x27; &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; (1961–1962) was a spin-off of a 1958 novelty song and the subsequent comic books with redesigned versions of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Other series contained unlicensed appropriations. For instance, Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1960–1966) was inspired by the sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and creator Jackie Gleason considered suing Hanna-Barbera, but he did not want to be known as &quot;the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air&quot;.

&quot;The Flintstones&quot; was the first prime-time animated series and became immensely popular, it remained the longest-running network animated television series for three decades. Hanna-Barbera scored more hits with &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot; (1960–1962), &quot;The Jetsons&quot; (1962–1963, 1985, 1987), and &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; (1969–1970, later followed by other Scooby-Doo series).

From around 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and then Robert F. Kennedy, and other violent acts made the public less at ease with violence in entertainment, networks hired censors to ban anything deemed too violent or suggestive from children&#x27;s programming.

Apart from regular TV series, there were several noteworthy animated television (holiday) specials, starting with UPA&#x27;s &quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1962), followed a few years later by other classic examples such as the string of Bill Melendez&#x27; &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials (1965–2011, based on Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip), and Chuck Jones&#x27;s &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1966, based on the story by Dr. Seuss).

====Cambria Productions====
Cambria Productions only occasionally used traditional animation and would often resort to camera movements, real-time movements between foreground and background cels, and integration of live-action footage. Creator Clark Haas explained: &quot;We are not making animated cartoons. We are photographing &#x27;motorized movement&#x27; and—the biggest trick of all—combining it with live-action... Footage that Disney does for $250,000 we do for $18,000.&quot; Their most famous trick was the Syncro-Vox technique of superimposing talking lips on the faces of cartoon characters instead of animating mouths synchronized to dialogue. This optical printing system had been patented in 1952 by Cambria&#x27;s partner and cameraman Edwin Gillette and was first used for popular &quot;talking animal&quot; commercials. The method would later be widely used for comedic effect, but Cambria used it straight in their series &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot; (1959–1960), &quot;Space Angel&quot; (1962), and &quot;Captain Fathom&quot; (1965). Thanks to imaginative stories, &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot; was a surprise hit. Their last series, &quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; (1965–1966), did not use Syncro-Vox. It contained 40 new live-action segments of the original Three Stooges that was spread and repeated through 126 segments of new animation (occasionally causing people to turn off their TV when live-action footage was repeated, convinced that they had already seen the episode).

===US theatrical animation in the 1960s===
For &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961) production costs were restrained, helped by the xerography process that eliminated the inking process. Although the relatively sketchy look produced by the xerox process is often maligned by historians and critics, the animators at the time embraced being able to have their drawings transferred directly onto the finished picture. This period at Disney also coincided with the maturation of the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot;, a tightly knit group of animators whom Walt entrusted with the development and animation of the films especially as Walt devoted increasingly more time to the construction of parks and other projects. Animators typically regard this period in the studio&#x27;s history as the most accomplished in terms of the draftsmanship and overall quality of animation. Animation, character designs, and model sheets from this period are still used as reference by animation schools and studios today. &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; was a hit for the studio as was &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963) though over the years it has become one of the least-known Disney features. 1964 saw the release of the live-action/animation hybrid &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) which received 13 Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture. Disney&#x27;s biggest animated feature of the 1960s was &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) which was both a critical and commercial success. This was also the final film that was overseen by Walt Disney before his death in 1966. After Walt&#x27;s passing, the studio went into a period of long decline. Led by the Nine Old Men, the studio continued to produce films that were successful enough to enable the continuation of the studio. As veteran animators began to age, a training program was introduced to nurture the next generation of talent. The departure of Don Bluth sapped the studio of many veterans and forced many young animators into taking on bigger responsibilities. By the early 1980s, the Nine Old Men had retired, many veterans were gone, and this cohort was struggling to keep the studio viable.

UPA produced their first feature &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot; (1959) (starring Mr. Magoo as Alladin&#x27;s uncle) for Columbia Pictures, with little success. They tried again with &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot; in 1962, released by Warner Bros. It was well received by critics, but failed at the box office and would be the last feature the studio made.

====Decline of the theatrical short cartoon====
The Supreme Court ruling of the Hollywood Anti-trust Case of 1948 prohibited &quot;block bookings&quot; in which hit feature films were exclusively offered to theatre owners in packages together with newsreels and cartoons or live-action short films. Instead of receiving a reasonable percentage of a package deal, short cartoons had to be sold separately for the prices that theatre owners were willing to pay for them. Short cartoons were relatively expensive and could now be dropped from the program without people losing interest in the main feature, which became a sensible way to reduce costs when more and more potential movie-goers seemed to stay at home to watch movies on their television sets. Most cartoons had to be re-released several times to recoup the invested budget. By the end of the 1960s most studios had ceased producing theatrical cartoons. Even Warner Bros. and Disney, with occasional exceptions, stopped making short theatrical cartoons after 1969. Walter Lantz was the last of the classic cartoon producers to give up when he closed his studio in 1973.

====DePatie–Freleng====
DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, founded by Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie in 1963 after Warner Bros. closed their animation department, was the only studio that found new success with short theatrical cartoon series after the 1950s. They created Pink Panther in 1963 for the opening and closing credits of the live-action Pink Panther film series featuring Peter Sellers. Its success led to a series of short films (1964–1980) and TV series (1969–1980). Pink Panther was followed by the spin-off &quot;The Inspector&quot; (1965–1969), &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot; (1969–1971), and a handful of other theatrical series. &quot;The Dogfather&quot; (1974–1976) was the last new series, but Pink Panther cartoons appeared in theaters until 1980, shortly before the demise of the studio in 1981. From 1966 to 1981 DePatie–Freleng also produced many TV series and specials.

===Rise of anime===

Japan was notably prolific and successful with its style of animation, which became known in the English language initially as Japanimation and eventually as anime. In general, anime was developed with limited-animation techniques that put more emphasis on aesthetic quality than on movement compared to USA animation. It also applies a relatively &quot;cinematic&quot; approach with zooming, panning, complex dynamic shots, and more attention to backgrounds which were instrumental to creating an atmosphere.

Anime was first domestically broadcast on TV in Japan in 1960. The export of theatrical anime features started around the same time. Within a few years, several anime TV series was made that would also receive varying levels of airplay in the United States and other countries, starting with the highly influential &quot;鉄腕アトム (Astro Boy)&quot; (1963), followed by &quot;ジャングル大帝 (Kimba the White Lion)&quot; (1965–1966), &quot;エイトマン (8th Man)&quot; (1965), &quot;魔法使いサリー (Sally the Witch)&quot; (1966–1967) and &quot;マッハGoGoGo (Mach GoGoGo a.k.a. Speed Racer)&quot; (1967).

The domestically popular &quot;サザエさん / Sazae-san&quot; started in 1969 and is the longest-running animated TV show in the world according to Guinness, with more than 2,250 episodes.

===Early adult-oriented and counterculture animation===

Before the end of the 1960s, hardly any adult-oriented animation had been produced. A notable exception was the pornographic short &quot;Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure&quot; (1928), presumably made by famous animators for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay, and not publicly screened until the late 1970s. After 1934, the Hays code gave filmmakers in the United States little leeway to release risky material, until the code was replaced by the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system in 1968. While television programming of animation had made most people think of it as a medium for children or family entertainment, new theatrical animations proved otherwise.

Arguably, the philosophical, psychological, and sociological overtones of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; TV specials were relatively adult-oriented, while the specials were also enjoyable for children. In 1969 director Bill Mendelez expanded the success of the series to cinemas with &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. The theatrical follow-up &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972) was a box-office flop, despite positive reviews. &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot; (1977) and &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don&#x27;t Come Back!!)&quot; (1980) were the only other theatrical traditionally animated feature films for &quot;Peanuts&quot;, while the TV specials continued until 2011.

The anti-establishment counterculture boom at the end of the 1960s impacted Hollywood early on. In animation, anti-war sentiments were present in several short underground films like Ward Kimball&#x27;s &quot;Escalation&quot; (1968) (made independently from his employment at Disney) and the parody &quot;Mickey Mouse in Vietnam&quot; (1969). The less political parody &quot;Bambi meets Godzilla&quot; (1969) by Marv Newland, another underground short film for adults, is considered a great classic and, based on a poll of 1,000 people working in the animation industry, was included in &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot;.

The popularity of psychedelia reportedly made the 1969 re-release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; popular among teenagers and college students, and the film started to make a profit. Similarly, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; became popular with TV screenings in this period and with its 1974 theatrical re-release.

Also influenced by the psychedelic revolution, The Beatles&#x27; animated musical feature &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (1968) showed a broad audience how animation could be quite different from the well-known television cartoons and Disney features. Its distinctive design came from the art director Heinz Edelman. The film received widespread acclaim and would prove to be influential. Peter Max further popularized a similar visual style in his artworks.

===Non-US animation in the 1960s===
* &quot;わんぱく王子の大蛇退治 (The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon)&quot; (Japan, 1963 feature)
* &quot;大鬧天宮 (Havoc in Heaven)&quot; (China, 1963 feature)
* &quot;ガリバーの宇宙旅行 (Gulliver&#x27;s Travels Beyond the Moon)&quot; (Japan, 1965 feature)
* &quot;Calimero&quot; (Italy/Japan 1963–1972, TV series)
* Belvision&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio in Outer Space&quot; (Belgium/USA 1965, feature directed by Ray Goossens)
* &quot;West and Soda&quot; (Italy 1965, first feature by Bruno Bozzetto)

==1970s: Adult-oriented cartoons and use in music videos==
===Breakthrough of adult-oriented and counterculture feature animation===

Ralph Bakshi thought that the idea of &quot;grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.&quot; He, therefore, created a more sociopolitical type of animation, starting with &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972), based on Robert Crumb&#x27;s comic books and it was the first animated feature to receive an X-rating. The X-rating was used to promote the film and it became the highest-grossing independent animated film of all time. The success of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; (1973) made Bakshi the first since Disney to have two financially successful animated feature films in a row. The film utilized an artistic blend of techniques with still photography as the background in parts, a live-action scene of models with painted faces rendered in negative cinematography, a scene rendered in very limited sketchy animation that was only partly colored, detailed drawing, archival footage, and most characters animated in a consistent cartoon style throughout it all, except the last ten minutes which were fully filmed as a standard live-action film. He continued to experiment with different techniques in most of his next projects. His next projects &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; (finished in 1975, but shelved by Warner Bros. until release in an adjusted version in 1982) and &quot;Coonskin&quot; (1975, suffered from protests against its perceived racism while satirizing it) were far less successful, but received more appreciation later on and became cult films.

Bakshi found new success with the fantasy films &quot;Wizards&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978). Both used rotoscoping for massive battle scenes. For &quot;Wizards&quot; the technique was used on archival footage as a solution to budgetary problems and rendered in a psychedelic artistic style. For &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; it became a means to create a look that Bakshi described as &quot;real illustration as opposed to cartoons&quot; for a film that he wanted to be true to Tolkien&#x27;s work, with reference material shot with costumed actors in Spain. The more family-oriented television film &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (1980) by Rankin/Bass and Topcraft is sometimes regarded as an unofficial sequel after Bakshi&#x27;s intended second part was not made, but they had already independently started their adaptation of the story on television with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1977.

The imaginative French/Czech science fiction production &quot;La Planète sauvage&quot; (1973) was awarded the Grand Prix special jury prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, and in 2016, it was ranked the 36th-greatest animated movie ever by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

The British production &quot;Watership Down (film)&quot; (1978) was a huge international success. It featured animal characters that looked more realistic than anthropomorphic, against watercolor backgrounds. Despite its dark and violent aspects, it was deemed suitable for all ages in the UK and rated PG in the United States.

===Anime in Europe===
Anime import offered relatively inexpensive animated series, but some European broadcasters thought of animation as something for young children and programmed anime series accordingly. This led to a lot of criticism when some programs were deemed too violent for children. Child-friendly adaptions of European stories ensured much more success in Europe, with popular titles such as &quot;アルプスの少女ハイジ (Heidi, Girl of the Alps)&quot; (1974) and &quot;みつばちマーヤの冒険 (Maya the Honey Bee)&quot; (1975).

Only a few animation studios were active in Europe and starting a new studio required a lot of time, effort, and money. For European producers interested in animated series, it made sense to collaborate with Japanese studios that could provide affordable animation of relatively high quality. Resulting productions of these arrangements include &quot;Barbapapa&quot; (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977), &quot;Wickie und die to starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ (Vicky the Viking)&quot; (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), &quot;Il était une fois... (Once Upon a Time...)&quot; (France/Japan 1978) and &quot;Doctor Snuggles&quot; (The Netherlands/West Germany/Japan/US 1979).

===Artistic short-animation highlights===

Short animated films mostly became a medium for film festivals in which independent animators showcased their talents. With the big studios away from the field, the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and nominations of the 1970s and 1980s usually went to relatively unknown artists.

&quot;La Linea&quot; (Italy 1971, 1978, 1986) is a popular animation series with the main character that is a part of an otherwise straight white line that runs horizontally across the screen.

Soviet/Russian animator Yuri Norstein &quot;is considered by many to be not just the best animator of his era, but the best of all time&quot;, according to Peter Finn. He released a handful of award-winning short films in the 1970s:
* &quot;The Battle of Kerzhenets&quot; (, 1971), in collaboration with Ivan Ivanov-Vano
* &quot;The Fox and the Hare&quot; (, 1973).
* &quot;The Heron and the Crane&quot; (, 1974).
* &quot;Hedgehog in the Fog&quot; (, 1975).
* &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; (, 1979).
Norstein has since 1981 been working on &quot;The Overcoat&quot; () and participated in .

===Early animated music videos===
Although the combination of music and animation has had a long tradition, it took some time before animation became part of music videos after the medium became a proper genre in the mid-1970s.

Halas and Batchelor produced an animated video for Roger Glover&#x27;s &quot;Love Is All&quot; (1974) that was broadcast internationally over decades, often as an interstitial program.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 &quot; Welcome to the Machine&quot; music video, animated by Gerald Scarfe, was initially only used as a backdrop for concert performances.

Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; (1979) was made by Annabelle Jackel and Rocky Morton, known for their animated commercials. Despite an initially lukewarm reception, the video has since received acclaim.

Roger Mainwood and John Halas created an animated music video for Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Autobahn&quot; in 1979. The short wordless documentary &quot;Making it move...&quot; showed the production process.

A cartoon for Linda McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Seaside Woman&quot; was made by Oscar Grillo and won a Palme d&#x27;Or for Best Short Film at the Cannes festival in 1980.

== 1980s ==

===US Animation Explosion (the 1980s)===
Animation for Saturday morning US TV programming had grown formulaic by the end of the 1970s being based on older cartoons and comic strip characters (Superfriends, Scooby Doo, Popeye) The demand for more cartoon content arose with the Reagan administration deregulation of children&#x27;s cartoons allowing for morning and afternoon time on UHF and cable channels now targeted toward children. Cartoons reflecting action, fantasy, and science fiction were common, with more complex narratives than cartoons of the previous decade. Several popular animated TV series of this time were based on toy lines, including Mattell&#x27;s &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (1983–1985) and Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; (1983–1986), &quot;The Transformers&quot; (1984–1987) and &quot;My Little Pony&quot; (1986–1987). Other cartoons were based on superhero comics, TV personalities (Garry Coleman, Chuck Norris, Mr. T), other live-action shows (Alf, Punky Brewster) adult action or science fiction movies (Robocop, Rambo, Ghostbusters, Teen Wolf), video games (Pac-Man, Pole Position, Captain N), or children&#x27;s literature (The Littles, Berenstain Bears). Japanese anime series were also edited and combined match to American broadcast guidelines (Robotech, Force Five).

Mostly in retrospect, Disney feature films have been perceived as going through a Dark Age in the decades after Walt Disney died in 1966 (despite a more steady string of box office successes than during the decades in which Walt was alive). The failure of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985), made on an ambitious budget, was a new low. Tim Burton cited Disney&#x27;s failure to train new animators during the 1960s and early 1970s as a reason for the decline, with Disney relying instead on an aging group of veterans.

Don Bluth, who had left Disney in 1979 together with nine other animators, started to compete with his former employer in cinemas in 1982 with &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. The film garnered critical acclaim but was only a modest success at the box office.

===Europe===
In comparison to the US animation output around the start of the 1980s, international co-productions seemed more imaginative and more promising. &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (1981–1989), produced by Belgian Freddy Monnickendam&#x27;s SEPP International in collaboration with Hanna-Barbera, was highly successful, and followed by &quot;Snorks&quot; (1984–1989) and &quot;Foofur&quot; (1986–1988). Production for Bzz Films&#x27; &quot;Bibifoc (Seabert)&quot; (1984–1988) was also handled by SEPP. Other notable international co-productions include &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (France/U.S.A. 1983) and &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (Canada/Japan 1986–1987).

In the U.K., Cosgrove Hall Films&#x27; very successful TV series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; debuted in September 1981 and would continue until 1992, receiving 11 BAFTA nominations between 1983 and 1987. Also broadcast on Nickelodeon, the witty secret agent parody featuring a mouse became popular with young as well as adult American audiences and spawned the &quot;Count Duckula&quot; (1988–1993) spin-off.

===Studio Ghibli and TV anime===

Anime, together with printed manga, had built an enormous fandom in Japan and became a big part of the country&#x27;s mainstream culture. Among anime&#x27;s many genres, mecha (giant-robot science fiction) became particularly iconic. Print manga in particular entered into a golden age during the 1980s, buoyed by series such as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1984–1995), and these series received successful long-running anime adaptations. The relatively new home video market grew very large and original video animation (OVA) became a much-appreciated medium, often with higher-quality productions than those made for TV (in contrast to the US, where direct-to-video was mainly a medium for releases that were not expected to be popular enough to warrant a theatrical release or TV broadcast and therefore often produced on a much lower budget). Naturally, the OVA medium was also suited for the consumption of erotic and pornographic animation. The first erotic OVA release was the &quot;ロリータアニメ (Lolita Anime)&quot; series from February 1984 to May 1985, soon followed by the &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; series (August 1984 – 2005). The genre became internationally known as hentai and is infamous for often containing perverse subject matters, including underage sex, monster sex, and tentacle sex (originally devised as a means to bypass Japanese censorship regulations). New anime series based on European material included &quot;ニルスのふしぎな旅 (The Wonderful Adventures of Nils)&quot; (1980–1981) and &quot;スプーンおばさん (Mrs. Pepper Pot)&quot; (1983–1984).

Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s epic theatrical features &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984), based on his manga, and &quot;天空の城ラピュタ (Castle in the Sky)&quot; (1986) are regularly praised as some of the greatest animated films of all time. &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was the first feature for Studio Ghibli, founded in 1985 by Miyazaki with Isao Takahata and others. Studio Ghibli continued its success with Takahata&#x27;s WWII film &quot;火垂るの墓 (Grave of the Fireflies)&quot; (1988) and Miyazaki&#x27;s iconic &quot;となりのトトロ (My Neighbor Totoro)&quot; (1988) and &quot;魔女の宅急便 (Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service)&quot; (1989).

===&quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; and the renaissance of US animation===
Beginning in the mid-1980s, US animation would see a renaissance. This has been credited to a wave of talent that emerged from the California Institute of the Arts- primarily among the cohort that had studied there in the 1970s under Marc Davis, a member of the Nine Old Men that had influenced the language of animation in the 1920s and 1930s. At this time, many of the Nine were in the process of retiring. As an inside joke, many students in the classroom A113 have inserted the room code into their films, television series, and so forth in the years since. The students of A113 include Jerry Rees, John Lasseter, Tim Burton, Michael Peraza, and Brad Bird. Two other members of the nine old men, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, published &quot;The Illusion of Life&quot; in 1981, an instructional book that has been voted the best animation book of all time and influenced James Baxter among other modern animators.

In cinemas, Robert Zemeckis&#x27; live-action/animation hit &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) also harkened back to the quality and zany comedy of the golden age of cartoons, with cameos of many of the superstars of that era, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Betty Boop, Droopy, Woody Woodpecker and the Mel Blanc-voiced Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, and Sylvester, in addition to original characters such as Roger Rabbit, Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman and Benny the Cab. The film won several Oscars and helped revive interest in theatrical feature animation and classic cartoons. The fully animated Roger Rabbit short film &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot; (1989) was then packaged with the live-action family comedy &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; and believed to have helped that movie&#x27;s quick start at the box-office. In collaboration with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, Bluth&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) became the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at the time. &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988) was equally successful, but Bluth&#x27;s next five feature films flopped.

&quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; (1987–1989) was one of the first animated TV shows to recapture the earlier quality and originality of American cartoons. It was produced by Ralph Bakshi and the first season was supervised by John Kricfalusi, who allowed plenty of artistic freedom for the animators. Rather than being a nostalgic rehash of the original Terrytoons series, it tried to recreate the quality and the zany humor of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; classics.

Matt Groening&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; started in April 1987 as a short segment in-sketch comedy show &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and then launched as a separate prime-time half-hour sitcom in December 1989. It became one of the biggest cartoon hits in history and is the longest-running scripted US primetime television series.

While the successes of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986) and &quot;Oliver and Company&quot; (1988) had already helped to get the Disney studio back on track, they struck gold with the box office record-breaking hit &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). A shot for the rainbow sequence at the end of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was the first piece of feature animation to be created with the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney and Pixar had collaboratively assembled. This digital ink and paint system replaced the expensive method of inking and coloring cells by hand and provided filmmakers with new creative tools. By 1990, the boom of animated hits was heralded as a comeback that might rival the golden age of cartoons.

===Adult-oriented theatrical animation in the 1980s===
Bakshi&#x27;s rock musical &quot;American Pop&quot; (1981) was another success, was mostly made with the rotoscope technique in combination with some watercolors, computer graphics, live-action shots, and archival footage. His next film &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983) was a collaboration with artist Frank Frazetta. It was one of many films in the sword and sorcery genre released after the success of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982). Critics appreciated the visuals and action sequences, but not its script and the film flopped at the box office. After failing to get several projects off the ground, Bakshi retired for a few years.

The Canadian anthology hit film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981) was based on comics published in the popular&quot;&quot; Heavy Metal&quot; magazine&quot; and was co-produced by its founder. Mixed reviews thought the film was uneven, juvenile, and sexist. It was eventually followed in 2000 by the poorly received &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; and re-imagined as the Netflix series &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot; in 2019.

The dark rock opera film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982) contained 15 minutes worth of animated segments by British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, who had already designed related artwork for the 1979 album and 1980-81 concert tour. Some of the film&#x27;s animated material was previously used for the 1979 music video for &quot;Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2&quot; and for the tour. Scarfe had also made animations for Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour.

The successful British nuclear disaster film &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (1986) showed hand-drawn characters against real backgrounds, with stop-motion for objects that moved.

The violent post-apocalyptic cyberpunk anime &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) garnered increased popularity for anime outside Japan and is now widely regarded as a classic.

===MTV and animated videos===

MTV launched in 1981 and further popularized the music video medium, which allowed relatively free artistic expression and creative techniques, since everyone involved wanted their video to stand out. Many of the most celebrated music videos of the 1980s featured animation, often created with techniques that differed from standard cel animation. For instance, the iconic video for Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; (1986) featured claymation, pixilation, and stop motion by Aardman Animations and the Brothers Quay.

A-ha&#x27;s &quot;Take On Me&quot; (1985) famously combined live-action with realistic pencil-drawing animation by Michael Patterson. The video was directed by Steve Barron, who would also direct the groundbreaking computer-animated Dire Straits &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; in the same year. The A-ha video was inspired by Alex Patterson&#x27;s CalArts graduation film &quot;Commuter&quot; (1984), which had attracted the attention of Warner Bros. Records executives and would be partly used again for A-ha&#x27;s &quot;Train of Thought&quot; video.

Patterson also directed Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; (1989), featuring his animated creation MC Skat Kat.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;The Harlem Shuffle&quot; (1986) featured animated elements directed by Ralph Bakshi and John Kricfalusi, created in a few weeks.

The original Moon landing bumpers on MTV were pulled in early 1986 in the wake of the &quot; Challenger&quot; disaster MTV then furthered its wild artistic postmodern image with a plethora of experimental ident bumpers, most of them animated. Animators usually went uncredited, but were free to work in their identifiable styles. For instance, Canadian animator Danny Antonucci&#x27;s anonymously contributed a feature with his &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; character that was allowed to utter his psychotic ramblings.

From around 1987, MTV had their own dedicated animation department and slowly started introducing more animation in between its music-related programming. Bill Plympton&#x27;s &quot;Microtoons&quot; is an early example.

===Rise of computer animation===

Early experiments with computers to generate (abstract) moving images had been conducted since the 1940s but had not garnered much attention until commercial arcade video games started to get marketed in the early 1970s. Pong (1972) by Atari, Inc., with very simple two-dimensional black-and-white graphics, and Taito&#x27;s Space Invaders became huge successes that paved the way for a medium that can be regarded as an interactive branch of computer animation. Since 1974, the annual SIGGRAPH convention has been organized to demonstrate developments and new research in the field of computer graphics (including CGI), but computer animation had seldom been seen on TV or in movie theaters (with notable exceptions of some demonstrations of 3D wire-frame models as futuristic technologies seen on screens in a few big Hollywood productions as &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977)).

3D computer animation started to have a much wider cultural impact during the 1980s, demonstrated for instance in the 1982 movie &quot;Tron&quot; and the music video for &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1985) by the Dire Straits. The concept even spawned a popular faux 3D-animated AI character: Max Headroom (introduced in 1985).

During the 1980s, computer animation also became a relatively common means to create motion graphics for logos and text in TV-commercials and movies title sequences.

==1990s: The Disney Renaissance and the rise of computer animation==
===Disney Renaissance===

The 1990s saw Disney release numerous films that were both critically and commercially successful, returning to heights not seen since their heyday of the 1930s to 1960s. The period from 1989 to 1999 is now referred to as the Disney Renaissance or the Second Golden Age and began with the release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). Their success led other major film studios to establish new animation divisions such as Amblimation, Fox Animation Studios or Warner Bros. Feature Animation to replicate Disney&#x27;s success by turning their animated films into Disney-styled musicals. The 90s are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Renaissance Age of Animation&quot; for animation as a whole, including both theatrical animated films and cartoon TV series.

Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) (the first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) successively broke box-office records. &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) opened to mixed reviews from critics but was a financial success, it received two Academy Awards and was well received by viewers. &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999) did not surpass &quot;The Lion King&quot; as the highest-grossing (traditionally) animated film of all time but the viewer and financial reception of both films were successful and each grossing over $300 million worldwide. &quot; The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996) was a financial success at the time but contained very dark and adult themes and has since become one of Disney&#x27;s lesser-known films, although it has a cult following. Only the sequel &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990) and &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997) underperformed box-office expectations, but they were both well received amongst the viewers like the other Disney Renaissance films.

From The Return of Jafar in 1994 to Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast in 2015, Disney continued to produce feature-length sequels to successful titles, but only as direct-to-video releases by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.

===Television===
John Kricfalusi&#x27;s influential &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (1991–1996) garnered widespread acclaim. Throughout its initial run, it was the most popular cable TV show in the United States. Although it was programmed as a children&#x27;s cartoon, it was notoriously controversial for its dark humor, sexual innuendos, adult jokes, and shock value. &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; was the third cartoon that premiered together with &quot;Doug&quot; (1991–1994, 1996–1999) and &quot;Rugrats&quot; (1991–1994, 1997–2004) on the paid Nickelodeon television channel. Klasky Csupo, the animation studio behind Rugrats, produced and animated era-defining shows for the children&#x27;s network, in the 1990s and 2000s. Once the studio faded into obscurity in 2008, they were succeeded by Frederator Studios, the studio behind &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; (2001–2006, 2009–2017). Frederator remained active for most of the 2000s and the 2010s, before fading into obscurity by 2017.

Before 1991, Nickelodeon would import cartoons from other channels to their network, which is a practice that remains ongoing. Examples of cartoons imported to Nickelodeon are &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot; (1999–2001) from Fox Family Channel (with foreign releases), &quot;Wayside&quot; (2005, 2007–2008), from the Canadian channel of Teletoon and &quot;Growing Up Creepie&quot; (2006–2008) from Discovery Kids. The most successful imported cartoon to the channel is &quot;PAW Patrol&quot; (2013–present), from another Canadian network Spin Master, which is on Nickeoldeon&#x27;s sub-channel Nick Jr., where programs on that station are aimed at toddlers rather than children or teenagers. The most successful cartoon native to Nick Jr. is &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; (2000-2019). Years before Nick&#x27;s heyday in the 90s, Nickelodeon launched the (unaired) pilot of &quot;Video Dream Theatre&quot; in 1979 or 1980, and it was soon to be followed by two more failed attempts of original animation, which were the aired pilots of &quot;Christmas in Tattertown&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Nick&#x27;s Thanksgiving Fest&quot; in 1989.

These early shows paved the way for later Nicktoons, including &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; (1993–1996, 2019), &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; (1996–2004, 2017), &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; (1997–2001), and &quot;CatDog&quot; (1998-2001/2005). Initially the long-running Nicktoon &quot;Rugrats&quot; was the flagship franchise of Nickelodeon before being surpassed by &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (1999–present) in 2004 when the network rebranded itself with the release of the first SpongeBob film.

On September 13, 1993, Fox Kids aired the first episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (1993–1998, 2020–2023) and in 1999 an Animaniacs film called Wakko&#x27;s Wish was released. Similarly to &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, Animaniacs had adult humour and innuendos. The enormous success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1989–present) and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (1991-1996) prompted more original and relatively daring series, including &quot;South Park&quot; (1997–present), &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1997–2010), &quot;Family Guy&quot; (1999-present), and &quot;Futurama&quot; (1999–2003, 2008–2013, 2023–present).

The use of animation on MTV increased as the channel started to make more shows that did not fit the &quot;music television&quot; moniker. &quot;Liquid Television&quot; (1991 to 1995) showcased contributions that were mostly created by independent animators specifically for the show and spawned the separate shows &quot;Æon Flux&quot; (1991-1995), &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; (1993–1997) as well as &quot;Daria&quot; (1997–2002). Other 1990s cartoon series on MTV included &quot;The Head&quot; (1994–1996) and &quot;The Maxx&quot; (1995), both under the &quot;MTV&#x27;s Oddities&quot; banner. By 2001, MTV closed its animation department, began to outsource its animated series, and eventually imported shows from associated networks.

Warner Brothers&#x27; 24-hour cable channel Cartoon Network was launched in the United States on October 1, 1992, and was soon followed by its international versions. Originally the programming consisted of classic cartoons from the back catalogs of Warner Bros, MGM, Fleischer/Famous, and Hanna-Barbera. From 1996 to 2003, new original series ran as &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; and included the popular titles &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; (1996–2003), &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; (1997–2004), &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; (1997–2000), &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; (1998–2005), &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; (1999–2009), and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; (1999–2002).

Television animation for children also continued to flourish in the United States on other specialized cable channels like Disney Channel/Disney XD, PBS Kids, and in syndicated afternoon time slots. Examples of animated Disney cartoons in the 90s are &quot;TaleSpin&quot; (1990–1991), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1992), &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992, 1995, 2000), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994–1995, 1996), &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994–1997), &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot; (1995–1999), &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1997–1998), &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; (1997–2000), and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Recess&quot; (1997–2001, 2003).

The Disney Channel (owned by Disney Branded Television), Nickelodeon (owned by Viacom, now known as Paramount Global), and Cartoon Network (owned by Warner Bros. Animation) dominated the animated television industry. These three channels are considered to be the &quot;Big Three&quot; of children&#x27;s entertainment.

===Breakthrough of computer animation and new media===
During the 1990s, 3D animation became more and more mainstream, especially in video games, and eventually had a big breakthrough in 1995 with Pixar&#x27;s feature film hit &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

More or less photo-realistic 3D animation has been used for special effects in some commercials and films since the 1980s before breakthrough effects were seen in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). Since then, techniques have developed to the stage that the difference between CGI and real-life cinematography is seldom obvious. Filmmakers can blend both types of images seamlessly with virtual cinematography. &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) and its two sequels are usually regarded as breakthrough films in this field.

The creation of virtual worlds allows real-time animation in virtual reality, a medium that has been experimented with since 1962 and started to see commercial entertainment applications in the 1990s.

The launch of the World Wide Web increased interest in motion graphics and computer animation, spawning many new applications, techniques, and markets for what became known as new media.

==2000s–2010s: Animation goes digital==

After the success of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) and DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), computer animation grew into the dominant animation technique in the US and many other countries. Even animation that looked traditional was often created fully with computers, helped by for instance cel-shading techniques to replicate the desired look of traditional animation (true real-time cel-shading was first introduced in 2000 by Sega&#x27;s &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; for their Dreamcast console). By 2004, only small productions were still created with traditional techniques.

The first decades of the 21st century also saw 3D film turn mainstream in theatres. The production process and visual style of CGI lend themselves perfectly to 3D viewing, much more than traditional animation styles and methods. However, many traditionally animated films can be very effective in 3D. Disney successfully released a 3D version of &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 2011, followed by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 2012. A planned 3D version of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was canceled when &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and two 3D-converted Pixar titles were not successful enough at the box office.

===Disney-Pixar===
Disney started producing their own 3D-style computer-animated features with &quot;Dinosaur&quot; and &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, but continued to make animated features with traditional look: &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002), &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), &quot;Brother Bear&quot; (2003) and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004).

&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; were big flops on big budgets and it looked like Disney would only continue with 3D computer animation. Financial analysis in 2006 proved that Disney had lost money on their animation productions in the previous ten years. In the meantime, Pixar&#x27;s CGI features did extremely well. To turn things around Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, and put creative control over both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios in the hands of Pixar&#x27;s John Lasseter as part of the deal. The studios would remain separate legal entities. Under Lasseter, the Disney studio developed both traditionally styled and 3D-styled animation projects.

The theatrical short &quot;How to Hook Up Your Home Theater&quot; (2007) tested whether new paperless animation processes could be used for a look similar to cartoons of the 1940s and 1950s, with Goofy returning to his &quot;Everyman&quot; role in his first solo appearance in 42 years.

Ron Clements and John Musker&#x27;s feature &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; (2009) was a moderate commercial and critical success, but not the comeback hit for traditional features that the studio had hoped it would be. Its perceived failure was mostly blamed on the use of &quot;princess&quot; in the title causing potential movie-goers to think it was only for little girls, and old-fashioned.

&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; (2011) received favorable reviews, but failed at the box office and was Disney&#x27;s most recent traditional feature to date, though the studio has stated in 2019 and 2023 that they are open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand-drawn feature projects. &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) was originally conceived in the traditional style but switched to 3D CGI to enable the creation of certain required visual elements. It became Disney&#x27;s biggest hit at the time, surpassing both &quot;The Lion King&quot; and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and winning the studio&#x27;s first Academy Award for a best-animated feature.

===Anime===
Hand-drawn animation continued to be very popular outside of the US, most notably in Japan, where traditionally styled anime remained the dominant technique. The popularity of anime continued to rise domestically, with a record-high 340 anime series airing on television in 2015, as well as internationally, with a dedicated Toonami block on Cartoon Network (1997–2008) and Adult Swim (since 2012) and with streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime licensing and producing an increasing amount of anime.

Studio Ghibli continued its enormous success with Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001), &quot;ハウルの動く城 (Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle)&quot; (2004), &quot;崖の上のポニョ (Ponyo)&quot; (2008) and &quot;風立ちぬ (The Wind Rises)&quot; (2013) and Hiromasa Yonebayashi&quot;借りぐらしのアリエッティ(The Secret World of Arrietty)&quot; (2010), all grossing more than $100 million worldwide and appearing in the top 20 of the highest-grossing anime films of all time (as of 2024). Takahata&#x27;s &quot;かぐや姫の物語 (The Tale of the Princess Kaguya)&quot; (2013) was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film Academy Award and many other awards.

Makoto Shinkai directed &quot;君の名は。(Your Name)&quot; (2016, highest-grossing anime film of all time internationally) and &quot;天気の子 (Weathering with You)&quot; (2019).

=== The Big Three in the 21st century ===
The 21st century Nicktoons included &quot;Invader Zim&quot; (2001–2006, 2019), &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; (2001, 2002–2006), &quot;ChalkZone&quot; (2002–2008), &quot;&quot; (2005–2008), and &quot;Catscratch&quot; (2005-2007), &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot; (2006, 2007-2011), &quot;The Mighty B!&quot; (2008-2011), Avatar&#x27;s spin-off series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot; (2012–2014), &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot; (2013–2016), &quot;Harvey Beaks&quot; (2015–2017), &quot;The Loud House&quot; (2016–present), the TLH spinoff &quot;The Casagrandes&quot; (2019-2022, 2024). &quot;It&#x27;s Pony&quot; (2020–2022), &quot;Glitch Techs&quot; (2020), &quot;Middlemost Post&quot; (2021-2022), &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; (2021-2022) &quot;Big Nate&quot; (2022-2024), and &quot;Rock Papper Scissors&quot; (2024–present).

Examples of CN cartoons of the 21st century are &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; (2001–2004, 2017), &quot;&quot; (2002–2008), &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (2003–2006), &quot;Ben 10&quot; (2005–2008), &quot;Adventure Time&quot; (2010–2018), the &quot;Regular Show&quot; (2010–2017) and &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot; (2011–2019).

Following the Disney Renaissance, Disney has produced &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002–2006, 2007), &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (2007–2015), &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; (2012–2016), &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot; (2015–2019), &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; (2016–2019), &quot;DuckTales&quot; (2017–2021), &quot;Big City Greens&quot; (2018-present), &quot;Amphibia&quot; (2019–2022), and &quot;The Owl House&quot; (2020–2023).

==Stop motion==
After pioneering work by the likes of J. Stuart Blackton, Segundo de Chomón, and Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, stop motion became a branch of animation that has been much less dominant than hand-drawn animation and computer animation. Nonetheless, there have been many successful stop-motion films and television series. Among the animators whose work with animated puppets has received the highest acclaim are Wladyslaw Starewicz, George Pal, and Henry Selick. Popular titles using animated clay include &quot;Gumby&quot; (1953), &quot;Mio Mao&quot; (1970), &quot;The Red and the Blue&quot; (1976), &quot;Pingu&quot; (1990–2000) and many Aardman Animations productions (&quot;Morph&quot; (1977) and &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; (1989)).

In the hands of influential filmmakers such as Jan Svankmajer and Brothers Quay, stop motion has been regarded as a highly artistic medium.

Until largely replaced by computer-animated effects, stop motion was also a popular technique for special effects in live-action films. Pioneer Willis O&#x27;Brien and his protégé Ray Harryhausen animated many monsters and creatures for live-action Hollywood films, using models or puppets with armatures. In comparison, hand-drawn animation has relatively often been combined with live-action, but usually in an obvious fashion and often used as a surprising gimmick that combines a &quot;real&quot; world and a fantasy or dream world. Only rarely has hand-drawn animation been used as convincing special effects (for instance in the climax of &quot;Highlander&quot; (1986)).

==Cutout animation==

Cutout techniques were relatively often used in animated films until cel animation became the standard method (at least in the United States). The earliest animated feature films, by Quirino Cristiani and Lotte Reiniger, were cutout animations.

Before 1934, Japanese animation mostly used cutout techniques rather than cel animation, because celluloid was too expensive.

As cutouts often have been hand-drawn and some productions combine several animation techniques, cutout animation can sometimes look very similar to hand-drawn traditional animation.

While sometimes used as a simple and cheap animation method in children&#x27;s programs (for instance in &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;), cutout animation has remained a relatively artistic and experimental medium in the hands of filmmakers like Harry Everett Smith, Terry Gilliam, John Korty and Jim Blashfield.

Today, cutout-style animation is frequently produced using computers, with scanned images or vector graphics taking the place of physically cut materials. &quot;South Park&quot; is a notable example of the transition since its pilot episode was made with paper cutouts before switching to computer software. Similar stylistic choices and blends with different techniques in computer animation have made it harder to differentiate between &quot;traditional&quot;, cutout, and Flash animation styles.

<text>Visual effects (sometimes abbreviated as VFX) is the process by which imagery is created or manipulated outside the context of 
a live-action shot in filmmaking and video production.
The integration of live-action footage and other live-action footage or CGI elements to create realistic imagery is called VFX.

VFX involves the integration of live-action footage (which may include in-camera special effects) and generated-imagery (digital or optics, animals or creatures) which look realistic, but would be dangerous, expensive, impractical, time-consuming or impossible to capture on film. Visual effects using computer-generated imagery (CGI) have more recently become accessible to the independent filmmaker with the introduction of affordable and relatively easy-to-use animation and compositing software.

==History==
===Early developments===

In 1857, Oscar Rejlander created the world&#x27;s first &quot;special effects&quot; image by combining different sections of 32 negatives into a single image, making a montaged combination print. In 1895, Alfred Clark created what is commonly accepted as the first-ever motion picture special effect. While filming a reenactment of the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots, Clark instructed an actor to step up to the block in Mary&#x27;s costume. As the executioner brought the axe above his head, Clark stopped the camera, had all the actors freeze, and had the person playing Mary step off the set. He placed a Mary dummy in the actor&#x27;s place, restarted filming, and allowed the executioner to bring the axe down, severing the dummy&#x27;s head. Techniques like these would dominate the production of special effects for a century.

It was not only the first use of trickery in cinema, it was also the first type of photographic trickery that was only possible in a motion picture, and referred to as the &quot;stop trick&quot;. Georges Méliès, an early motion picture pioneer, accidentally discovered the same &quot;stop trick.&quot;

According to Méliès, his camera jammed while filming a street scene in Paris. When he screened the film, he found that the &quot;stop trick&quot; had caused a truck to turn into a hearse, pedestrians to change direction, and men to turn into women. Méliès, the director of the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, was inspired to develop a series of more than 500 short films, between 1896 and 1913, in the process developing or inventing such techniques as multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color.

Because of his ability to seemingly manipulate and transform reality with the cinematograph, the prolific Méliès is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cinemagician.&quot; His most famous film, &quot;Le Voyage dans la lune&quot; (1902), a whimsical parody of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, featured a combination of live action and animation, and also incorporated extensive miniature and matte painting work.

=== Modern ===
VFX today is heavily used in almost all movies produced. Other than films, television series and web series are also known to utilize VFX.

==Techniques==
* Special effects: Special effects (often abbreviated as SFX, SPFX, F/X or simply FX) are illusions or visual tricks used in the theatre, film, television, video game and simulator industries to simulate the fictional events in a story or virtual world. With the emergence of digital film-making, a distinction between special effects and visual effects has grown, with the latter referring to digital post-production while &quot;special effects&quot; refers to mechanical and optical effects. Mechanical effects (also called practical or physical effects) are usually accomplished during the live-action shooting. This includes the use of mechanized props, scenery, scale models, animatronics, pyrotechnics and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds, making a car appear to drive by itself and blowing up a building, etc. Mechanical effects are also often incorporated into set design and makeup. For example, prosthetic makeup can be used to make an actor look like a non-human creature. Optical effects (also called photographic effects) are techniques in which images or film frames are created photographically, either &quot;in-camera&quot; using multiple exposures, mattes, or the Schüfftan process or in post-production using an optical printer. An optical effect might place actors or sets against a different background.
*Motion capture: Motion-capture (sometimes referred as mo-cap or mocap, for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robotics. In filmmaking and video game development, it refers to recording actions of human actors, and using that information to animate digital character models in 2-D or 3-D computer animation. When it includes face and fingers or captures subtle expressions, it is often referred to as performance capture. In many fields, motion capture is sometimes called motion tracking, but in filmmaking and games, motion tracking usually refers more to match moving.
*Matte painting: A matte painting is a painted representation of a landscape, set, or distant location that allows filmmakers to create the illusion of an environment that is not present at the filming location. Historically, matte painters and film technicians have used various techniques to combine a matte-painted image with live-action footage. At its best, depending on the skill levels of the artists and technicians, the effect is &quot;seamless&quot; and creates environments that would otherwise be impossible or expensive to film. In the scenes the painting part is static and movements are integrated on it.
*Animation: Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop-motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets or clay figures. Swift progression of consecutive images with minor differences is a common approach to achieving the stylistic look of animation. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain. Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on the computer, techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.

*3D modeling: In 3D computer graphics, 3-D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any &quot;surface&quot; of an object (either inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software. The product is called a 3-D model. Someone who works with 3-D models may be referred to as a 3-D artist. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called &quot;3D rendering&quot; or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.
*Rigging: Skeletal animation or rigging is a technique in computer animation in which a character (or another articulated object) is represented in two parts: a surface representation used to draw the character (called the &quot;mesh&quot; or &quot;skin&quot;) and a hierarchical set of interconnected parts (called &quot;bones&quot;, and collectively forming the &quot;skeleton&quot; or &quot;rig&quot;), a virtual armature used to animate (&quot;pose&quot; and &quot;key-frame&quot;) the mesh. While this technique is often used to animate humans and other organic figures, it only serves to make the animation process more intuitive, and the same technique can be used to control the deformation of any object—such as a door, a spoon, a building, or a galaxy. When the animated object is more general than, for example, a humanoid character, the set of &quot;bones&quot; may not be hierarchical or interconnected but simply represent a higher-level description of the motion of the part of the mesh it is influencing.

*Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is an animation technique that animators use to trace over motion picture footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic action. Originally, animators projected photographed live-action movie images onto a glass panel and traced over the image. This projection equipment is referred to as a &quot;rotoscope&quot;, developed by Polish-American animator Max Fleischer. This device was eventually replaced by computers, but the process is still called rotoscoping. In the visual effects industry, &quot;rotoscoping&quot; is the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background. Chroma key is more often used for this, as it is faster and requires less work, however, rotoscope is still used on subjects that are not in front of a green (or blue) screen, due to practical or economic reasons.
*Match Moving: In visual effects, match-moving is a technique that allows the insertion of computer graphics into live-action footage with correct position, scale, orientation, and motion relative to the photographed objects in the shot. The term is used loosely to describe several different methods of extracting camera motion information from a motion picture. Sometimes referred to as motion-tracking or camera-solving, match moving is related to rotoscoping and photogrammetry. Match moving is sometimes confused with motion capture, which records the motion of objects, often human actors, rather than the camera. Typically, motion capture requires special cameras and sensors and a controlled environment (although recent developments such as the Kinect camera and Apple&#x27;s Face ID have begun to change this). Match moving is also distinct from motion control photography, which uses mechanical hardware to execute multiple identical camera moves. Match moving, by contrast, is typically a software-based technology applied after the fact to normal footage recorded in uncontrolled environments with an ordinary camera. Match moving is primarily used to track the movement of a camera through a shot so that an identical virtual camera move can be reproduced in a 3D animation program. When new CGI elements are composited back into the original live-action shot, they will appear in a perfectly matched perspective.
*Compositing: Compositing is the combining of visual elements from separate sources into single images, often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Live-action shoots for compositing is variously called &quot;chroma key&quot;, &quot;blue screen&quot;, &quot;green screen&quot; and other names. Today, most, though not all, compositing is achieved through digital image manipulation. Pre-digital compositing techniques, however, go back as far as the trick films of Georges Méliès in the late 19th century, and some are still in use.
*Splash of color: The term splash of color is the use of a colored item on an otherwise monochrome film image.

==Production pipeline==
Visual effects are often integral to a movie&#x27;s story and appeal. Although most visual effects work is completed during post-production, it usually must be carefully planned and choreographed in pre-production and production. While special effects such as explosions and car chases are made on set, visual effects are primarily executed in post-production with the use of multiple tools and technologies such as graphic design, modeling, animation and similar software. A visual effects supervisor is usually involved with the production from an early stage to work closely with production and the film&#x27;s director to design, guide and lead the teams required to achieve the desired effects.

===Visual effects companies===

Many studios specialize in visual effects; among them are Digital Domain, DreamWorks, DNEG, Framestore, Weta Digital, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Pixomondo, Moving Picture Company and Sony Pictures Imageworks &amp; Jellyfish Pictures.

<doc id="323863" wikidata="Q917963" url="?curid=323863" title="Bristol Proteus">
<text>The Bristol Proteus was the Bristol Engine Company&#x27;s first mass-produced gas turbine engine design, a turboprop that delivered just over 4,000 hp (3,000 kW). The Proteus was a reverse-flow gas turbine. Because the second turbine drove no compressor stages, but only the propeller, this engine was classified as a free-turbine. It powered the Bristol Britannia airliner, small naval patrol craft, hovercraft and electrical generating sets. It was also used to power a land-speed record car, the Bluebird-Proteus CN7. After the merger of Bristol with Armstrong Siddeley the engine became the Bristol Siddeley Proteus, and later the Rolls-Royce Proteus.
The Proteus was to have been superseded by the Bristol Orion which would have given a Britannia a 75% increase in power for cruising faster.

==Design and development==
The Proteus was to power a very large airliner for use after the war. Design work started in September 1944 with its free turbine and propeller gearbox based on the earlier Bristol Theseus engine. The compressor had 12 axial and 2 centrifugal stages. The gas generator was built as a turbojet, and called the Bristol Phoebus, to speed development of the engine by not hindering it with gearbox problems. It was test-flown in May 1946 fitted to the bomb bay of an Avro Lincoln, performance was poor and the first centrifugal compressor stage was removed. The first Proteus, the Proteus 1, also ran with the original compressor, as first tested in the Phoebus, but by 1950 had been redesigned as the Proteus 2 with only a single centrifugal stage.

The Proteus 2 (Mk.600 series) was supposed to produce 3,200 shp and weigh 3,050 lb. It was overweight and underpowered, weighing 3,800 lb producing 2,500 shp, and plagued with mechanical problems with virtually every part including compressor blades, turbine blades and bearings which failed at frequent intervals even at low power levels. This led to the famous quote of Proteus Chief Engineer Frank Owner to Chief Engineer of the Engine Division Stanley Hooker: &quot;You know, Stanley, when we designed the Proteus I decided we should make the engine with the lowest fuel consumption in the world, regardless of its weight and bulk. So far, we have achieved the weight and bulk!&quot; The redesigned Proteus 3 (700 series) gave 3,780 shp and weighed nearly 1,000 lb less than the previous design. It came too late for the first prototype Britannia and Saunders-Roe Princess flying-boat though. Eight engines on the Princess were mounted in four pairs with each pair driving two propellers through a gearbox in opposite directions. They were known as Coupled Proteus. Two more engines were mounted singly with reversing propellers for manoeuvring on water. The Coupled Proteus was also intended to be used on the Mk.II version of the Bristol Brabazon, but this project was cancelled. Only three Princesses were built, only one of which flew, and by the time the second Britannia was ready for testing the Proteus 3 was installed.

In 1954 a potentially troublesome design feature in the propeller gearbox, straight-cut gears, finally made itself known during a flight carrying a delegation from the Dutch airline KLM, a potential customer. A gearwheel stripped its teeth and the resulting damage set fire to the aircraft which made an emergency landing on the mud in the river Severn estuary. 
Hearing of this failure, Lord Hives of Rolls-Royce, Hooker&#x27;s former boss, sent Rolls-Royce engineers to assist the Bristol team. This unasked-for generosity to what was, after all, a commercial competitor thawed the cold relationship that had existed between Hives and Hooker since Hooker&#x27;s departure from Rolls-Royce concerning development of the Avon in 1948.

Developing an anti-icing system for the engine intake turned out to be a lengthy exercise. It had to be able to deal with the type of icing considered likely to cause problems to Britannias. Icing tests on a Proteus installation in an Ambassador aircraft in Canada showed that the engine and powerplant anti-icing system could deal with severe icing conditions of the type considered likely in parts of the world where the Britannia would operate. However, during route-proving flights in Africa in April 1956 a different type of icing was encountered for which the anti-icing systems were ineffective. Modifications were made that were effective against this second type of icing. BOAC started services in February 1957 but later in the year a third type of icing was encountered on flights to Australia. When flying in icing conditions for prolonged periods the accumulation of ice on the surfaces of the reverse-flow air intake – inherited from the original intended Brabazon II and Princess installation – and subsequent shedding through the engine caused flame-outs. The engine would auto-relight with a long tongue of flame from the jetpipe which was of concern to the passengers. Although the problem was not inherently dangerous, it was avoided with restrictions in the flight manual (it could be avoided by not flying in cloud above a certain height). Modifications for the third type were successfully tested in icing conditions encountered during flights from Singapore in April 1958. BOAC, the launch customer for the Britannia, were unyielding in their demands for rectification, and attempted to maximise the extent of the problem in public, damaging sales prospects of the Britannia and delaying the aircraft&#x27;s entry into service by two years, as well as almost bankrupting Bristol Aircraft.

The Mk.705 of 3,900 hp (2,900 kW) was the first version used the Bristol Britannia 100 and some 300 series aircraft. The Mk.755 of 4,120 hp (3,070 kW) was used on the 200 series (not built) and other 300s, and the Mk.765 of 4,445 hp (3,315 kW) was used on the RAF Series 250 aircraft.

==Variants==
As with most gas turbine engines of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s the Ministry of Supply allocated the Proteus a designation which was apparently little used. Officially the Proteus was named Bristol BPr.n Proteus

==Applications==

===Aircraft===
*Bristol Britannia
*Bristol Type 167 Brabazon I Mk.II
*Saunders-Roe Princess

===Other applications===
After testing on the frigate HMS &quot;Exmouth&quot; a marinised Proteus engine was used to power the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot;-class fast patrol boats, and subsequently in many fast patrol boats of similar design built for export by Vosper. These were among the fastest warships ever built, achieving over 50 knots on flat water. The Swedish torpedo boat &quot;Spica&quot; and her sisters were also powered by the Proteus. The Italian Navy&#x27;s hydrofoil Sparviero-class patrol boats used a Proteus to drive a pump jet at high speeds.

The Proteus was used on the SR.N4 &quot;Mountbatten&quot;-class cross-Channel hovercraft. In this installation four &quot;Marine Proteus&quot; engines were clustered in the rear of the craft, exhausts pointed rearward. The engines drove horizontal power shafts that delivered power to one of four &quot;pylons&quot; positioned at the corners of the boat. At the pylons, gearboxes used the horizontal torque to power a vertical shaft, with a lift fan at the bottom and propeller at the top. The two at the front required long shafts running above the passenger cabin, as all four engines were mounted at the rear of the craft.

==== Pocket Power Stations ====

Another use of the Proteus was for remote power generation in the South West of England in what were called &quot;Pocket Power Stations&quot;. The regional electricity board installed several 2.7 MW remote operated generation sets for peak load powered by the Proteus. Designed to run for ten years many were still in use forty years later. A working example is preserved at the Internal Fire - Museum of Power in West Wales.

<text>Gaylord Jackson Perry (September 15, 1938 – December 1, 2022) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for eight teams from 1962 to 1983, becoming one of the most durable and successful pitchers in history. A five-time All-Star, Perry was the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues. He won the American League (AL) award in 1972 after leading the league with 24 wins with a 1.92 earned run average (ERA) for the fifth-place Cleveland Indians, and took the National League (NL) award in 1978 with the San Diego Padres after again leading the league with 21 wins; his Cy Young Award announcement just as he turned the age of 40 made him the oldest to win the award, which stood as a record for 26 years. He and his older brother Jim Perry, who were Cleveland teammates in 1974–1975, became the first brothers to both win 200 games in the major leagues, and remain the only brothers to both win Cy Young Awards.

Perry gained notoriety for doctoring baseballs (e.g. throwing spitballs), and perhaps even more so for making batters think he was throwing them on a regular basis—he went so far as to title his 1974 autobiography &quot;Me and the Spitter&quot;, though he claimed that his use of the prohibited practice was in the past. He was the subject of two decades of controversy during which opposing managers, umpires and league officials frequently attempted to catch him in a violation, even revising rules and guidelines; despite the constant scrutiny, he was not ejected from a game for the practice until his 21st season in the majors in 1982. In the meantime, Perry firmly established himself as one of baseball&#x27;s most accomplished pitchers. He won 20 games five times and struck out 200 batters eight times, leading his league in innings pitched and complete games twice each. He pitched a no-hitter in September 1968, three weeks after throwing a one-hitter, and also pitched thirteen career two-hitters. In 1978 Perry became the third pitcher to register 3,000 strikeouts, and while pitching for the Seattle Mariners in 1982, he became the first pitcher in 19 years to join the 300 win club; he joined Walter Johnson to become only the second pitcher to reach both milestones.

During a 22-year career, with most of its second half spent with losing teams, Perry compiled 314 wins; upon his retirement, he ranked third in major league history with 3,534 strikeouts and his 690 games started placing him behind only Cy Young&#x27;s 815. His 5,350 innings pitched ranked fourth; he had been the first right-handed pitcher since the 1920s to surpass 5,000 innings. He was the last pitcher to throw 300 complete games, and was then the eighth-oldest pitcher ever to start a major league game. Perry was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his third year of eligibility, a delay widely regarded as resulting from his career-long controversies.

==Early life==
Perry was born in Williamston, North Carolina, and named after a close friend of his father&#x27;s, who had died while having his teeth pulled.

Gaylord was the son of Evan and Ruby Perry, who were farmers. Evan Perry had been a noted athlete. Gaylord grew up with his older brother Jim and younger sister Carolyn in Williamston and the small area of Farmlife, a populated place located within the Township of Griffins, a minor division of Martin County. Gaylord assisted his father with farming on their family&#x27;s land in this area. Jim and Gaylord both began playing baseball with their father during their lunch break on the farm as youths.

Gaylord attended Williamston High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was All-State as an offensive and defensive end as a sophomore and junior, before giving up football. In basketball, Gaylord and Jim helped Williamston to reach the state finals in Gaylord&#x27;s first year. In his career at Williamston, Gaylord averaged nearly 30 points and 20 rebounds per game, as Williamston had a 94–8 record. He would turn down dozens of college basketball scholarship offers.

In baseball, Perry initially was a third baseman as a freshman, and Jim was the pitcher for Williamston. However, near the end of Gaylord&#x27;s first year, he began sharing pitching duties with Jim. In 1955 Williamston High won the North Carolina Class A state tournament, as the Perry brothers threw back-to-back shutouts to sweep the best-of-three finals. Gaylord had a 33–5 win–loss record in his high school career.

As a teenager, Perry played semi-professional baseball for the Alpine Cowboys in Alpine, Texas at Kokernot Field. Perry and his brother both attended Campbell University, where they played college baseball.

==Pitching style==
Perry claims he was taught the spitball in 1964 by pitcher Bob Shaw. Perry had a reputation throughout his career for doctoring baseballs, and was inspected on the mound by umpires and monitored closely by opposing teams. On August 23, 1982, he was ejected from a game against the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball for the first and only time of his career; though umpire Dave Phillips ejected him without inspecting the ball, Perry was still suspended for 10 days.

Perry reportedly approached the makers of Vaseline about endorsing the product and was allegedly rebuffed with a one-line postcard reading, &quot;We soothe babies&#x27; backsides, not baseballs.&quot; Former manager Gene Mauch famously quipped &quot;He should be in the Hall of Fame with a tube of K-Y Jelly attached to his plaque.&quot;

Gene Tenace, who caught Gaylord Perry when they played for the San Diego Padres, said: &quot;I can remember a couple of occasions when I couldn&#x27;t throw the ball back to him because it was so greasy that it slipped out of my hands. I just walked out to the mound and flipped the ball back to him.&quot;

Perry used his reputation to psych out the hitters too. As he looked in to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he may or may not have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry in a 1982 game that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.

The spitball was not his only method for upsetting batters. Sportswriter Joe Posnanski described Perry&#x27;s &quot;Puffball,&quot; writing that Perry &quot;would load up on the resin bag and so when he threw the pitch, this big puff of resin smoke would form and the hitter would have a hard time even finding the ball, much less hitting it. The puff ball was outlawed in 1981 strictly because of Perry.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
The San Francisco Giants signed Perry on June 3, 1958, and he received a $90,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut in the 1958 season with the St. Cloud Rox team in the Class A level Northern League, compiling a 9–5 record and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 17 games (15 starts).

In 1959, the Giants promoted Perry to the Double-A Corpus Christi Giants, where he posted a 10–11 record and 4.05 ERA in 41 games (26 starts). He remained with the franchise as they became the Rio Grande Valley Giants in the 1960 season, and he finished with a 9–13 record and an improved ERA of 2.82 in 32 games (23 starts). His performance earned him a promotion to the Triple-A Tacoma Giants for the 1961 season. At Tacoma, Perry led the Pacific Coast League in wins (16) and innings pitched (219) in 1961.

===San Francisco Giants (1962–1971)===
Perry made his major league debut with the Giants on April 14, 1962, against the Cincinnati Reds. In the game, he allowed four earned runs on five hits in innings, picking up a no-decision. He appeared in 13 games (seven starts) for the Giants, but had a 3–1 record and a 5.23 ERA and was sent back down to Tacoma in June, where he went on to lead the PCL with a 2.44 ERA. Perry was promoted back to the Giants in September, but was not on the roster for the team&#x27;s World Series appearance; it would be the only time in his career that he pitched for a pennant winner.

After his brief call-up in 1962, Perry joined the Giants in 1963 to work mostly as a relief pitcher, going 1–6 with a 4.03 ERA in 31 appearances (four starts). Nevertheless, he was given the opportunity to join the starting rotation in 1964. In 44 games (19 starts), Perry finished with a 2.75 ERA and a 12–11 record, both second-best for the Giants that year behind Juan Marichal. In 1965, his record was 8–12, and with two full seasons as a starter, his 24–30 record attracted little national attention.

Perry&#x27;s breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous start, going 20–2 into August. Perry and Marichal became known as a &quot;1–2 punch&quot; to rival the famous Koufax/Drysdale combination of the Los Angeles Dodgers. While Marichal was NL Player of the Month in May, Perry was so named in June (5–0, 0.90 ERA, 31 strikeouts). He played in his first All-Star game, but after August, he slumped the rest of the season, finishing 21–8, and the Giants finished second to the Dodgers. Marichal missed much of the 1967 season with a leg injury, and Perry was thrust into the role of team ace. While he finished the season with a disappointing 15–17 record, he posted a 2.61 ERA and allowed only 7.1 hits per nine innings pitched in 39 games (37 starts).

Perry had similar numbers in 1968: he posted a 16–15 record, but with a then-career-best 2.45 ERA in 39 games (38 starts), helping the Giants to a second-place finish behind the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 17 of that year, two days after his 30th birthday, Perry threw a 1–0 no-hitter against the Cardinals and Bob Gibson at Candlestick Park. The lone run came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt—the second of the only two he hit that season. The next day, Ray Washburn of the Cardinals no-hit the Giants, winning 2–0, and marking the first time in major league history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series.

Like most pitchers, Perry was not renowned for his hitting ability, and in his sophomore season of 1963, his manager Alvin Dark is said to have joked, &quot;There would be a man on the moon before Gaylord Perry would hit a home run.&quot; There are other variants on the story, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just an hour after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career.

In 1969, Perry led the league in innings pitched, but the Giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight season. Perry took over as the Giants&#x27; ace in 1970, and led the league both in wins (23) and innings pitched (). Perry&#x27;s strong 1970 performance salvaged the Giants&#x27; season, helping them finish above .500 but in third place. In 1971, the Giants finally won their division, with Perry posting a 16–12 record and 2.76 ERA in 37 starts. In what would be his only trip to the postseason, Perry won Game 1 of the National League Championship Series but lost the decisive Game 4 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

===Cleveland Indians (1972–1975)===
On November 29, 1971, the Giants traded the then 33-year-old Perry and shortstop Frank Duffy to the Cleveland Indians for 29-year-old flamethrower Sam McDowell, the ace of the Indians&#x27; staff. Perry went 24–16 in 1972 with a 1.92 ERA and one save in 41 games (40 starts), winning his first Cy Young Award. He remained the only Cy Young winner for Cleveland until CC Sabathia in 2007.

By the 1973 season, Perry was widely suspected of throwing a spitball. That season, Bobby Murcer of the New York Yankees publicly criticized Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, and Joe Cronin, the president of the American League, for lacking the &quot;guts&quot; to enforce Rule 8.02, which banned the spitball; in response, Kuhn fined Murcer $250 (equivalent to $ today). After losing a game to Perry, Billy Martin, manager of the Detroit Tigers, told reporters that he instructed his pitchers to throw a spitball, leading to Cronin suspending Martin for three games. Publicly, Perry insisted that the pitch was a &quot;hard slider&quot;.

After the 1973 season, Perry approached Bob Sudyk, sportswriter for the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot;, about co-authoring an autobiography. Sudyk said that Perry would have to be willing to discuss the rumors that he threw a spitball, and Perry agreed. Phil Seghi, the general manager of the Indians, tried to dissuade Perry from sharing his secrets, but was unsuccessful. Perry showed Sudyk how he threw spitballs with substances like Vaseline and K-Y Jelly, and a &quot;puffball&quot; using rosin dust. Perry also showed Sudyk how he hid additives on his uniform and body. The book, titled &quot;Me and the Spitter&quot;, was released in 1974.

Before the 1974 season, Major League Baseball added to Rule 8.02, now nicknamed &quot;Gaylord&#x27;s Rule&quot;, allowing umpires to call an automatic ball if they suspected a spitball, and eject the pitcher on the second offense. During spring training, the Indians acquired Perry&#x27;s brother Jim from the Tigers as part of a three-team trade including the Yankees. Gaylord was named AL Player of the Month in June 1974, after winning six complete games. In July, he started for the AL in the All-Star Game, the only time he started the game, but he got no decision in the AL&#x27;s 7–2 loss. Perry won 21 games in 1974, and was Cleveland&#x27;s last 20-game winner until Cliff Lee in 2008; his brother added 17 wins, with the pair accounting for half of the team&#x27;s 77 victories.

Perry feuded with player-manager Frank Robinson after Robinson was acquired during the 1974 season. Perry told the press that he wanted to earn &quot;one dollar more&quot; than Robinson&#x27;s $173,000 salary. They also feuded over Robinson&#x27;s training regimen during spring training in 1975. Perry began the 1975 season with a 6–9 record and a 3.55 ERA in 15 starts through mid-June. In May, the Indians traded Jim Perry to the Oakland Athletics after he began the season with a 1–6 record and 6.69 ERA; it would turn out to be his final major league season.

===Texas Rangers (1975–1977)===

On June 13, 1975, at the start of a three-game series with the Texas Rangers, the Indians traded Perry to the Rangers in exchange for pitchers Jim Bibby, Jackie Brown, and Rick Waits. Perry was 12–8 with a 3.03 ERA in 22 starts during the remainder of 1975.

In 1976, Perry had a 15–14 record and a 3.24 ERA in 32 starts. The Rangers protected Perry in the expansion draft after the season. In 1977, the Rangers surged to second place in the AL West. Perry again won 15 games, this time against only 12 defeats, in a rotation that included Doyle Alexander, Bert Blyleven, and Dock Ellis.

===San Diego Padres (1978–79)===
Before the 1978 season, the Rangers traded Perry to the San Diego Padres in exchange for middle reliever Dave Tomlin and $125,000. In the final game of the 1978 season, Perry recorded his 3,000th strikeout, becoming the third pitcher to do so after Walter Johnson and Bob Gibson. Perry won the Cy Young Award, going 21–6 with a 2.73 ERA in 37 starts for San Diego, becoming the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues.

In 1979, Perry posted a 12–11 record and a 3.05 ERA in 32 starts before quitting the team on September 5, saying he would retire unless the club traded him back to Texas. The Padres traded Perry to the Texas Rangers on February 15, 1980, with minor leaguers Tucker Ashford and Joe Carroll for first baseman Willie Montañez.

===Texas Rangers / New York Yankees (1980)===
In 1980, Perry posted a 6–9 record and 3.43 ERA in 24 starts with Texas before being traded to the Yankees on August 13, 1980, for minor leaguers Ken Clay and a player to be named later (Marvin Thompson). Many Yankees players had complained about Perry during his stints with the Rangers, and the club even used a special camera team to monitor his movements during one of his starts at Yankee Stadium. Perry finished the season with a 4–4 record with a 4.44 ERA in 10 games (eight starts) for the Yankees. He did not pitch in the team&#x27;s trip to the AL Championship Series.

===Atlanta Braves (1981)===
Perry&#x27;s contract was up after the 1980 season and he agreed to a one-year, $300,000 contract with the Atlanta Braves for the 1981 season on January 8. During the strike-shortened 1981 season, Perry, the oldest player at the time in Major League baseball, started 23 games ( innings) and had an 8–9 record with a 3.94 ERA. The Braves released Perry after the season, leaving him three victories short of 300.

===Seattle Mariners / Kansas City Royals (1982–83)===
After being released by the Braves, Perry was unable to find interest from any clubs during the offseason, and missed his first spring training in 23 years. On March 5, 1982, he signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners, where he acquired the nickname &quot;Ancient Mariner.&quot; Perry won his 300th game on May 6, 1982, becoming the first pitcher to win 300 games since Early Wynn did so in 1963. On August 23, he was ejected from a game against the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a ten-day suspension. It was the second time Perry had been ejected in his entire career, and it was his first ejection for ball doctoring.

After starting the 1983 season 3–10, Perry was designated for assignment by Seattle on June 26 and the Kansas City Royals picked him on a waiver claim ten days later. In August, Perry became the third pitcher in history to record 3,500 strikeouts. In the final months of the season, Perry experimented with a submarine delivery for the first time in his career and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the first-place Baltimore Orioles on August 19.

In August 1983, Perry became the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime strikeout king Walter Johnson&#x27;s record of 3,509 strikeouts. Steve Carlton and Nolan Ryan were the others. Also in 1983, Perry was involved in the Pine Tar Game against the New York Yankees. The game originally ended when the umpires called George Brett out for too much pine tar on his bat, negating his home run and drawing a vehement protest from him and the Royals. Perry absconded with Brett&#x27;s bat and gave it to a bat boy so he could hide it in the clubhouse, only to be caught by Joe Brinkman. When the Royals won the protest, Perry was retroactively ejected for doing this.

Perry announced his retirement on September 23, 1983. He finished his MLB career with 314 wins, a 3.11 ERA, and 3,534 strikeouts. He threw 303 complete games.

==Post-playing career==
Perry retired to his farm in Martin County, North Carolina, where he grew tobacco and peanuts, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1986. He briefly worked for Fiesta Foods as a sales manager, and later in the year Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina, chose Perry to be the college&#x27;s first baseball coach. Perry was there until 1991 when he retired. In 1998, Perry was inducted into the Limestone College Athletics Hall of Fame (Class of 1998). He later moved to Spruce Pine, North Carolina.

Perry supported the Republican Party. He campaigned for Jesse Helms and contemplated a bid for Congress himself in 1986.

==Honors==
In 1991, his third year of eligibility, Perry was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1999, he was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1998, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked him 97th on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Bill James lists Perry as having the tenth best career of any right-handed starting pitcher, and the 50th greatest player at any position.

On July 23, 2005, the Giants retired Perry&#x27;s uniform number 36. Perry was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on March 9, 2009. Perry was honored on April 9, 2011, at AT&amp;T Park with a 2010 World Series ring along with other San Francisco Giants greats Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie Mays. He was honored again on April 7, 2013, with Mays and Juan Marichal receiving a 2012 World Series ring, and on April 18, 2015, with a 2014 World Series ring along with Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, and Marichal. The Indians invited Perry to throw the ceremonial first pitch before their Opening Day game for the 2015 season. On August 13, 2016, the Giants unveiled a bronze statue of Perry at the corner of Second and King streets outside of AT&amp;T Park.

==Personal life==
Perry&#x27;s wife, Blanche Manning Perry, died on September 11, 1987, when a car ran a stop sign and hit her car broadside on U.S. Route 27 in Lake Wales, Florida. Perry and Blanche had three daughters and one son. Their son, Jack, died of leukemia on June 18, 2005. In 1988, Perry launched the baseball program at Limestone College (now Limestone University) in Gaffney, South Carolina, and his son Jack was an inaugural team member. Jack was an accomplished pitcher and was posthumously inducted into the Limestone University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. Jack pitched three seasons at Limestone under his father&#x27;s coaching and is the only player in team history to throw a no-hitter—achieving a no-hitter twice within two weeks during the 1990 season. Perry&#x27;s nephew, Chris, is a professional golfer on the PGA Tour.

Perry contracted COVID-19 in 2021 and never fully recovered. He died at home on December 1, 2022, at age 84.

<doc id="323884" wikidata="Q1262858" url="?curid=323884" title="Hong Kong Jockey Club">
<text>The Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) was founded in 1884 and is one of the oldest institutions in Hong Kong. In 1960, it was granted a royal charter and renamed The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club (). The institution reverted to its original name in 1996 due to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Membership of the club is by nomination and election. 

It is a non-profit organisation providing horse racing, sporting and betting entertainment in Hong Kong. It holds a government-granted monopoly in providing pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, the Mark Six lottery, and fixed odds betting on overseas football events. The organisation is the largest taxpayer in Hong Kong, as well as the largest community benefactor and one of the city&#x27;s major employers. In 2022/2023, The Hong Kong Jockey Club contributed a record HK$35.9 billion to the community. This comprised a record HK$28.6 billion in betting duty, profits tax and Lotteries Fund contributions, and HK$7.3 billion in approved charity donations. The club also proactively identifies, funds and develops projects which anticipate and address social issues and pressing needs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Jockey Club also provides dining, social, sport and recreation facilities to its approximately 23,000 members. Its Charities Trust is also one of the world&#x27;s top ten charity donors.

==History==
Founded in 1884 as an amateur body to promote horse racing, it was an exclusive club whose membership was drawn from the upper class with strict rules of membership, with women and people of unsuitable background being banned. This led to the club having no Chinese members until the 20th century.

The club evolved into a professional institution from 1971. The club organised the annual races which took place around Chinese New Year and was initially financed by commissions on bets which were placed through private clubs.

Queen Elizabeth II accorded the club with a royal charter in 1960, and it became &quot;The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club&quot; () until 1996.

In July 2005, the decision was made to stage equestrian competitions of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Hong Kong. The club&#x27;s racing centre at Sha Tin was used as the foundation for the Olympic and Paralympic venues, with additional competition and training venues being incorporated into existing sports facilities at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, the Jockey Club Beas River Country Club and the adjacent golf course.

In January 2023, after Regina Ip proposed increasing taxes on the Jockey Club&#x27;s football betting revenue, the Jockey Club said that the move would &quot;destroy&quot; its business model and jeopardize public interest. In February 2023, after Financial Secretary Paul Chan increased football betting taxes, Chan said &quot;They can have their reactions, and we will do what we have to do.&quot;

==Racing activities==
The HKJC conducts nearly 700 horse races per year at its two race tracks at Sha Tin (沙田) and Happy Valley (快活谷). During the 2001/02 racing season, the HKJC licensed 1,144 horse owners, 24 trainers and 35 jockeys and had 1,435 horses in training.

In 2002–2003, the betting turnover was HK$71 billion. After paying dividends of 58 billion and betting duty of 9.5 billion, its betting commission revenue was HK$3.9 billion. It contributes 11.7% of Hong Kong&#x27;s tax revenue. Surpluses from its operation are allocated to The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust.

Following the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, the popularity of horse racing declined substantially, possibly due to economic conditions in the region.

On 16 March 2007, the HKJC appointed William (Bill) Nader, formerly with the New York Racing Association, as its executive director of racing from April 2007.

On 9 September 2007, Sha Tin Racecourse opened after its summer break with record 1-day crowd of about 60,000. Chief Secretary Henry Tang struck the ceremonial gong. The Hong Kong Jockey Club collected US$106 million in bets (highest since 2001). Children of horse owners were admitted amid protest of local anti-gambling groups. &quot;Sunny Power&quot;, booted by Howard Cheng, got the trophy in the 1,200-metre dash.

In January 2008, Eclipse and Sovereign Award winning jockey Emma-Jayne Wilson became the first North American female rider to be granted a license to compete in Hong Kong.

The reform and other changes mentioned above, the HKJC revenue has steadily increased back to previous levels and above. The total racing revenue for the Racing Season 2011/2012 reached HK$86.1 billion, up 43.4% since the 2006 reform.

==Betting and the law==

The HKJC has a legal monopoly over betting on horse racing and football. In 1974, it opened 6 off-course branches where the members of the public could wager on horse race meets at the club&#x27;s Happy Valley racecourse. There are now in excess of 100 betting branches throughout the territory that accept bets on racing and football, as well as buy Mark Six lottery tickets.

The HKJC was instrumental in persuading the Hong Kong government to pass the Gambling (Amendment) Bill 2002 to combat unauthorised cross-border gambling and the related promotional activities in Hong Kong, making it a criminal offence for any person in Hong Kong to bet with an unauthorised bookmaker, even when the bets are received outside Hong Kong. The offence applies to all visitors as well as to residents of Hong Kong.

It was also instrumental in persuading other members of the Asian Racing Federation to sign the Good Neighbour policy on 1 September 2003.

===2006 Horse racing reforms===
In 2006, after years of declining turnover, the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the Betting Ordinance (Amendment) 2006. This amendment granted the Hong Kong Jockey Club more autonomy in how it ran its own operations.

====Single-race bets====

==Social membership==
Membership in this club is very strict, limited to the moneyed social elite. In the past, this club was reserved for only &quot;old money&quot; families; but currently there are increasing numbers of &quot;newly rich&quot; members. Similar to other elite clubs, HKJC membership applicants often must wait for years if not decades to be accepted. What makes it especially difficult to join is that this club does not allow memberships to be bought and sold in the secondary market. 

For joining racing membership, one has to be proposed by a voting member and seconded by another voting member, with the support of three other members. For joining full membership, one has to be proposed by a voting member. Note that if a interested person is not yet a racing member, applications to be racing member and full member must be made at the same time if one is intended to be full member.

As of 30 June 2022, the joining fee for racing membership is HK$150,000 whereas that for full membership is HK$850,000. Monthly fee is HK$850 and HK$2,550 respectively. 
In September 2021, the club terminated several memberships, including those of Martin Lee, Jimmy Lai, and Albert Ho.

==Charities==

The Hong Kong Jockey Club can trace its long tradition of donating to charitable causes back to at least 1915, but it was in the 1950s, as Hong Kong struggled to cope with post-war reconstruction and a massive influx of immigrants, that this role became integral to its operation. In 1955, the Club formally decided to devote its surplus each year to charity and community projects, and in 1959, a separate company, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (Charities) Ltd, was formed to administer donations. In 1993, a new entity was established, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, to reflect the evolving nature, scale and scope of donations. The Charities Trust is one of the world’s top ten charity donors.

Over many years, the Club has established its position as a major social partner in fostering a caring and inclusive community in Hong Kong. It accomplishes this through donations made to its community partners via The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust; various Trust-initiated projects; and by organising its own events that allow people to experience a healthy and vibrant lifestyle. Today, the Charities Trust contributes across various areas of social needs and focuses on five strategic areas: Positive Ageing &amp; Elderly Care, Youth Development &amp; Poverty Alleviation, Healthy Community, Talent &amp; Sector Development, and Sports &amp; Culture.

Over the past decade, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has donated an average of HK$5 billion a year to the community. In 2022/2023, its total approved donations were HK$7.3 billion, benefiting 247 charity and community projects.

The Charities Trust’s substantial donations to the community are made possible by The Hong Kong Jockey Club’s unique integrated business model, which comprises racing and racecourse entertainment, responsible sports wagering and lottery, a membership club, and charities and community contribution. Approximately 90% of the Club’s annual operating surplus after tax is donated to its Charities Trust, enabling it to play a significant role in the community’s development.

==Lease==
The Happy Valley Racecourse occupies a 92,000 m2 plot of land on Inland Lot 8847, under a government-subsidized Private Recreational Lease. The lease began in 1884 and currently is set to expire on 23 June 2034.

&quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot; in September 2021 claimed that the Jockey Club has broken its earlier promise to return the land at the Happy Valley Racecourse in exchange for land in Shatin.

In August 2024, news reported that the Jockey Club would convert some land it leased cheaply from the government (HK$84,600 per year) to build and sell private residences with high potential profit, with one researcher saying that such a plan was unfair and that &quot;The government has leased the land to them at a very favourable price. It is not reasonable for them to profit fully from it.&quot;

==Club chairmen==
==CEO==
The role of Chief Executive Officer was first known as the General Manager. Major-General Bernard Penfold was appointed as the club&#x27;s first General Manager in 1972.

#Major-General Robert Bernard Penfold, (1972–1979)
#General Sir Arthur John Archer (1979–1986)
#Major-General Guy Hansard Watkins,  (1986–1996)

<doc id="323886" wikidata="Q646322" url="?curid=323886" title="Franco-Dutch War">
<text>The Franco-Dutch War was a European conflict that lasted from 1672 to 1678. Its primary belligerents were France, backed at different times by Münster, Cologne, England, and the Swedish Empire, and the Dutch Republic, allied with the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark-Norway. The 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War and 1675 to 1679 Scanian War are considered related conflicts.

Fighting began in May 1672 when France nearly overran the Netherlands, an event remembered in Dutch history as the &quot;Rampjaar&quot;, or &quot;Disaster Year&quot;. However, by late July their position had stabilised, while in 1673 concern over French gains brought support from Emperor Leopold I, Spain and Brandenburg-Prussia. England exited the war and made peace with the Dutch in February 1674. 

Having sought a quick and overwhelming victory, Louis XIV of France now faced war on multiple fronts. He changed focus, instead strengthening his borders with the Spanish Netherlands and Rhineland, while the Allies led by William of Orange sought to minimise any losses. By 1677, France had occupied Franche-Comté and made strategic gains in the Spanish Netherlands and Alsace, but neither side was able to achieve a decisive victory. 

Though France failed to conquer the Dutch Republic, the September 1678 Peace of Nijmegen is often seen as the high point of French power in this period. Spain recovered Charleroi from France, but in return ceded Franche-Comté, as well as much of Artois and Hainaut. Under William of Orange, the Dutch recovered all the territory lost at the beginning, making him dominant in domestic politics. This position helped him create the anti-French Grand Alliance that fought in the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War, and subsequent 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession.

==Origins==

As part of a general policy of opposition to Habsburg power in Europe, France backed the Dutch Republic during the 1568 to 1648 Eighty Years War against Spain. The 1648 Peace of Münster confirmed Dutch independence and permanently closed the Scheldt estuary, benefiting Amsterdam by eliminating its rival, Antwerp. Preserving this monopoly was a Dutch priority, but this increasingly clashed with French aims in the Spanish Netherlands, which included reopening Antwerp.

William II of Orange&#x27;s death in 1650 led to the First Stadtholderless Period, with political control vested in the urban patricians or &quot;Regenten&quot;. This maximised the influence of the States of Holland and Amsterdam, the power base of Johan de Witt, Grand Pensionary from 1653 to 1672. He viewed his relationship with Louis XIV of France as crucial for preserving Dutch economic power, but also to protect him from his domestic Orangist opponents.

Although France and the Republic concluded an assistance treaty in 1662, the States of Holland refused to support a division of the Spanish Netherlands, convincing Louis his objectives could only be achieved by force. The Dutch received limited French support during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667) but increasingly preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. Shortly after talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War began in May 1667, Louis launched the War of Devolution, rapidly occupying most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté.

In July, the Treaty of Breda ended the Anglo-Dutch War, leading to talks between the Dutch and Charles II of England on a common diplomatic front against France. This was supported by Spain and Emperor Leopold, who was also concerned by French expansion. After his first suggestion of an Anglo-French alliance was rejected by Louis, Charles entered the 1668 Triple Alliance, between England, the Republic and Sweden. After the Alliance mediated between France and Spain, Louis relinquished many of his gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
While Breda and Aix-la-Chapelle were seen as Dutch diplomatic triumphs, they also presented significant dangers; De Witt himself was well aware of these, but failed to convince his colleagues. Louis considered the January 1668 Partition Treaty with Leopold confirmation of his right to the Spanish Netherlands, a point reinforced by Aix-la-Chapelle, despite his concessions. He no longer saw the need to negotiate, and decided their acquisition was best achieved by first defeating the Republic.

The Dutch also over-estimated their own power; defeat at Lowestoft in 1665 exposed the shortcomings of their navy and the federal command system, while the successful Raid on the Medway was largely due to English financial weakness. In 1667, the Dutch States Navy was at the height of its power, an advantage rapidly eroded by English and French naval expansion. The Anglo-Dutch War was primarily fought at sea, masking the poor state of the Dutch army and forts, deliberately neglected since they were viewed as bolstering the power of the Prince of Orange.

In preparation for an attack on the Republic, Louis embarked on a series of diplomatic initiatives, the first being the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, an Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch. It contained secret clauses not revealed until 1771, including the payment to Charles of £230,000 per year for providing a British brigade of 6,000. Agreements with the Bishopric of Münster and Electorate of Cologne allowed French forces to bypass the Spanish Netherlands, by attacking via the Bishopric of Liège, then a dependency of Cologne (see Map). Preparations were completed in April 1672, when Charles XI of Sweden accepted French subsidies in return for invading areas of Pomerania claimed by Brandenburg-Prussia.

==Preparations==
French armies of the period held significant advantages over their opponents; an undivided command, talented generals like Turenne, Condé and Luxembourg, as well as vastly superior logistics. Reforms introduced by Louvois, the Secretary of War, helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much quicker. This meant the French could mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready, seize their objectives, then assume a defensive posture. As in other wars of the period, the army&#x27;s strength fluctuated throughout the conflict; starting with 180,000 in 1672, by 1678 it had an authorised strength of 219,250 infantry and 60,360 cavalry, of whom 116,370 served in garrisons.

The retention of border towns like Charleroi and Tournai in 1668 allowed Louvois to pre-position supply dumps, stretching from the French border to Neuss in the Rhineland. 120,000 men were allocated to attacks on the Republic, split into two main groups; one at Charleroi, under Turenne, the other near Sedan, commanded by Condé. After marching through the Bishopric of Liège, they would join near Maastricht, then occupy the Duchy of Cleves, a possession of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. At the same time 30,000 mercenaries, paid by Münster and Cologne and led by Luxembourg, would attack from the east. One final element was a planned English landing in the Spanish Netherlands but this ceased to be a viable option as the Dutch retained control of the sea.

The French had demonstrated their new tactics when over-running the Duchy of Lorraine in mid 1670, while the Dutch were given accurate information on their plans as early as February 1671. These were confirmed by Condé in November and again in January 1672, Dutch regent de Groot describing him as &quot;one of our best friends.&quot; However, the Dutch were poorly prepared for a campaign against France; available funds had mostly been invested in the fleet, at the expense of their land defences. Most of the Dutch States Army was based in the three southern fortresses of Breda, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Maastricht; in November 1671, the Council of State reported these as being short of supplies and money, with many fortifications barely defendable. Most units were substantially below strength; on 12 June, one officer reported his official strength of eighteen companies had only enough men for four.

This was partly because with Prince William now of age, his Orangist supporters refused to approve additional military spending unless he was appointed Captain-General, a move opposed by de Witt. Aware of internal English opposition to the Anglo-French alliance, the Dutch relied on the provisions of the Triple Alliance requiring England and the Republic to support each other, if attacked by Spain or France. This assumption was shared by the Parliament of England, who approved funding for the fleet in early 1671 to fulfil its obligations under the alliance. The true danger only became obvious on 23 March, when acting under orders from Charles, the Royal Navy attacked a Dutch merchant convoy in the Channel; this followed a similar incident in 1664.

In February 1672, de Witt compromised by appointing William as Captain-General for a year. Budgets were approved and contracts issued to increase the army to over 80,000 but assembling these men would take months. Negotiations with Frederick William to reinforce Cleves with 30,000 men were delayed by his demands for Dutch-held fortresses on the Rhine, including Rheinberg and Wesel. By the time they reached agreement on 6 May, he was occupied with a French-backed Swedish invasion of Pomerania, and could not engage the French in 1672. The Maastricht garrison was increased to 11,000, in the hope they could delay the French long enough to strengthen the eastern border; the cities provided 12,000 men from their civil militia, with 70,000 peasants conscripted to build earthworks along the IJssel river. These were unfinished when France declared war on 6 April, followed by England on 7 April, using a manufactured diplomatic incident known as the &#x27;Merlin&#x27; affair. Münster and Cologne entered the war on 18 May.

==French offensive: 1672==

===France crosses the Rhine===
The French offensive began on 4 May 1672 when a subsidiary force under Condé left Sedan and marched north along the right bank of the Meuse. Next day, Louis arrived in Charleroi to inspect the main army of 50,000 under Turenne, one of the most magnificent displays of military power in the seventeenth century. Accompanied by Louis, on 17 May Turenne met up with Condé at Visé, just south of Maastricht; supported by Condé, Louis wanted to besiege the fortress immediately but Turenne convinced him it would be folly to allow the Dutch time to reinforce other positions. Avoiding a direct assault on Maastricht, Turenne prevented it being reinforced by occupying outlying positions at Tongeren, Maaseik and Valkenburg.

Leaving 10,000 men to cover Maastricht, the rest of the French army crossed back over the Meuse, then advanced along the Rhine, supported by troops from Münster and the Electorate of Cologne, led by Luxembourg. The Dutch garrisoned forts intended to defend the Rhine crossings were still severely undermanned and poorly equipped. By 5 June, the French had captured Rheinberg, Orsoy and Burick, with minimal resistance; Wesel, perhaps the most important fortress, surrendered when the townspeople threatened to butcher the commanders, followed by Rees on 9 June. Having secured their rear, the bulk of the French army began to cross the Rhine at Emmerich am Rhein; Grand Pensionary De Witt was deeply shocked by the news of the catastrophe and concluded &quot;the fatherland is now lost&quot;.

Although the situation on land had become critical for the Dutch, events at sea were much more favourable. On 7 June, Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter attacked the Anglo-French fleet as it took on supplies at Southwold on the English coast. The French squadron under d&#x27;Estrées and English squadrons under the Duke of York failed to properly coordinate, which meant that the French ended up fighting a separate battle with Lieutenant-Admiral Adriaen Banckert. This led to mutual recriminations between the two allies. Although ship losses were roughly equal, the Battle of Solebay ensured the Dutch retained control of their coastal waters, secured their trade routes and ended hopes of an Anglo-French landing in Zeeland. Anger at the alleged lack of support from D&#x27;Estrées increased opposition to the war, and the English Parliament was reluctant to approve funds for essential repairs. For the rest of the year, this restricted English naval operations to a failed attack on the Dutch East India Company Return Fleet.

===IJssel Line is outflanked===
In early June, the Dutch headquarters at Arnhem prepared itself for a French onslaught on the IJssel Line. Only twenty thousand troops could be assembled to block a crossing and a dry spring meant that the river could be forded at many points. Nevertheless, there seemed to be no alternative but to make a last stand at the IJssel. However, should the enemy outflank this river by crossing the Lower Rhine into the Betuwe, the field army would fall back to the west to prevent being surrounded and quickly annihilated. The commander of Fort Schenkenschanz protecting the Lower Rhine abandoned his position. When he arrived at Arnhem with his troops, immediately a force of two thousand horse and foot under Field Marshal Paulus Wirtz was sent out to cover the Betuwe. At arrival they intercepted French cavalry crossing at a ford pointed out to them by a farmer. A bloody encounter fight followed but in this Battle of Tolhuis on 12 June, the Dutch cavalry was eventually overwhelmed by French reinforcements. Louis personally observed the battle from the Elterberg. Condé was shot through the wrist. In France, this battle was celebrated as a major victory and paintings of the &quot;Passage du Rhin&quot; have this crossing as their subject, not the earlier one at Emmerich.

Captain-General William Henry now wanted the entire field army to fall back on Utrecht. However, in 1666 the provinces had regained full sovereignty of their forces. Overijssel and Guelders in June 1672 withdrew their troops from the confederated army. The French army made little effort to cut off the escape route of the Dutch field army. Turenne recrossed the Lower Rhine to attack Arnhem, while part of his army moved to the Waal towards Fort Knodsenburg at Nijmegen. Louis wanted to besiege Doesburg first, on the east side of the IJssel, taking it on 21 June. The king delayed the capture somewhat to allow his brother, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, to take Zutphen some days earlier. On his right flank, the armies of Münster and Cologne, reinforced by a French corps under de Luxembourg, advanced to the north along the river, after having taken Grol on 10 June and Bredevoort on 18 June. The IJssel cities panicked. Deventer seceded from the Republic and again rejoined the Holy Roman Empire on 25 June. Then, the province of Overijssel surrendered as a whole to the bishop of Münster, Bernard von Galen, whose troops plundered towns on the west side of the IJssel, such as Hattem, Elburg and Harderwijk, on 21 June. Louis ordered Luxembourg to expel them again, as he wanted to make the duchy of Guelders a French possession. Annoyed, Von Galen announced to advance to the north of the Republic and invited de Luxembourg to follow him by wading through the IJssel, as no pontoon bridge was available. Exasperated, Luxembourg got permission from Louis to withhold his corps and the army of Cologne from the Münsterite forces.

From that point onwards, Von Galen would wage a largely separate campaign. He started to besiege Coevorden on 20 June. Von Galen, nicknamed &quot;Bomb Berend&quot;, was an expert on artillery ammunition and had devised the first practical incendiary shell or carcass. With such fire shot he intimidated the garrison of Coevorden into a quick surrender on 1 July. He was advised by his subcommanders to subsequently plunder the hardly defended Friesland and use vessels captured there to isolate Groningen, the largest city in the north. Alternatively, he could take Delfzijl, allowing a landing by an English expeditionary force. But the bishop feared the Protestant British would make common cause with the Calvinist Groningers and expected that his siege mortars would force a fast capitulation, starting the Siege of Groningen on 21 July.

===Peace negotiations===

On 14 June, William arrived with the remnants of the field army, some eight thousand men, at Utrecht. The common citizens had taken over the city gates and refused him entrance. In talks with the official city council, William had to admit that he had no intention to defend the city but would retreat behind the Holland Water Line, a series of inundations protecting the core province of Holland. Eventually, the council of Utrecht delivered the keys of the gates to Henri Louis d&#x27;Aloigny (the Marquis de Rochefort), to avoid plundering. On 18 June, William withdrew his forces. The flooding was not ready yet, only having been ordered on 8 June, and the countryside of Holland was defenceless against the French. On 19 June, the French took the fortress of Naarden close to Amsterdam.

In a defeatist mood a divided States of Holland – Amsterdam was more pugnacious – sent a delegation to de Louvois in Zeist to ask for peace terms, headed by Pieter de Groot. The French king was offered the Generality Lands and ten million guilders. Compared to the eventual outcome of the war, these conditions were very favourable to France. It would have led to territorial gains in the Low Countries for France not equalled until 1810. The Generality Lands included the fortresses of Breda, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Maastricht. Their possession would have greatly facilitated the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands, and the remaining Republic would have been little more than a French satellite state. De Louvois, rather bemused that the Estates had not capitulated but still considered some damage control possible, demanded far harsher terms.

The Dutch were given the choice of surrendering their southern fortresses, permitting religious freedom for Catholics and a payment of six million guilders, or France and Münster retaining their existing gains – thus the loss of Overijssel, Guelders and Utrecht – and a single payment of sixteen million livres. Louis knew perfectly well that the delegation did not have the mandate to agree such terms and would have to return for new instructions. However, he also did not continue his advance to the west.

Several explanations have been given for this policy. The French were rather overwhelmed by their success. They had within a month captured three dozen fortresses. This strained their organisational and logistical capacities. All these strongholds had to be garrisoned and supplied. An intrusion into Holland proper seemed meaningless to them, unless Amsterdam could be besieged. This city would be a very problematic target. It had a population of 200,000 and could raise a large civil militia, reinforced by thousands of sailors. As the city had recently expanded, its fortifications were the best maintained in the Republic. Their normal armament of three hundred pieces was being enlarged by the militia hauling the reserve ordnance of the Admiralty of Amsterdam upon the ramparts which began to bristle with thousands of cannon. The low-lying surrounding terrain, below sea level, was easily flooded, making a traditional attack via trenches impractical. The battle fleet could support the fortifications from the IJ and Zuyderzee with gun fire, meanwhile ensuring a constant resupply of the food and ammunition stocks. A deeper problem was that Amsterdam was the world&#x27;s main financial centre. The promissory notes with which many of the French military and the contractors had been paid, were covered by the gold and silver reserves of the Amsterdam banks. Their loss would mean the collapse of Europe&#x27;s financial system and the personal bankruptcy of large segments of the French elite.

Relations with England were also delicate. Louis had promised Charles to make William Henry the Sovereign Prince of a Holland rump state and puppet state. He very much preferred that it would be France pulling the strings but there was a distinct possibility that the uncle of the prince would be in control. Louis had not mentioned William in his peace conditions. The very patricians that the French king desired to punish were traditionally pro-French and his natural allies against the pro-English Orangists. He wanted to simply annex Holland and hoped that fear of the Orangists would cause the &quot;regenten&quot; to surrender the province to him. Of course, the opposite might happen too: that a French advance would lead to the Orangists taking power and capitulating to England. The province of Zealand had already decided to rather make Charles their lord than be subjugated by the French. Only fear of the military power of De Ruyter&#x27;s fleet had kept them from surrendering outright to the English. De Ruyter would not tolerate any talk of capitulation and intended, if necessary, to take the fleet overseas to continue the fight. Louis feared the English wanted to claim Staats-Vlaanderen which he saw as French territory because the County of Flanders was a fief of the French crown. In secret he arranged an informal warband of six thousand under Claude Antoine de Dreux to quickly cross the officially neutral Spanish Flanders and execute a surprise assault on the Dutch fortress of Aardenburg, on 25–26 June. The attempt was a total failure, the small garrison killing hundreds of attackers and taking prisoner over six hundred Frenchmen who had become pinned down in a ravelin.

Louis also allowed his honour to take precedence over the raison d&#x27;état. The harsh peace conditions upon which he insisted were meant to humiliate the Dutch. He demanded an annual embassy to the French court asking pardon for their perfidy and presenting a plaquette extolling the magnanimity of the French king. For Louis, a campaign was not complete without some major siege to enhance his personal glory. The quick surrender of so many cities had been somewhat disappointing in this respect. Maastricht having escaped him for the time being, he turned his attention on an even more prestigious object: &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, which was considered &quot;inexpugnable&quot;. The city was not only a formidable fortress in itself, it was surrounded by a rare fortification belt. Normally its marshy surroundings would make a siege impossible but its presently weak garrison seemed to offer some possibility of success. After Nijmegen had been taken on 9 July, Turenne captured near &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch Fort Crèvecœur, which controlled the sluice outlets of the area, halting further inundations. The main French force, thus removed from the Holland war theatre, camped around Boxtel and Louis took residence in Heeswijk Castle.

===Orangists take power===
The news that the French had penetrated into the heart of the Republic led to a general panic in the cities of the province of Holland. Blaming the States regime for the Dutch collapse, their populations rioted. Members of the city councils were by force replaced by Orangist partisans or in fear of reprisals declared for the cause of the Prince of Orange. Pamphlets accused the &quot;regenten&quot; of having betrayed the Republic to Louis and De Ruyter of wanting to deliver the fleet to the French. When the French peace terms became known on 1 July, they caused outrage.

The result was to bolster Dutch resistance. On 2 July, William was appointed stadtholder of Zealand and on 4 July of Holland. The new stadtholder William III of Orange was given a general mandate to negotiate. Meanwhile, the polders of the Holland Water Line had slowly filled, forming an obstacle to a possible French advance.
Charles thought that William&#x27;s rise to power allowed to quickly obtain a peace favourable to England. He sent two of his ministers to Holland. They were received with jubilation by the population, who assumed they came to save them from the French. Arriving at the Dutch army camp in Nieuwerbrug, they proposed to install William as monarch of a Principality of Holland. In return he should pay ten million guilders as &quot;indemnities&quot; and formalise a permanent military English occupation of the ports of Brill, Sluys and Flushing. England would respect the French and Münsterite conquests. To their surprise, William flatly refused. He indicated that he might be more pliable if they managed to moderate the French peace terms. They then travelled to Heeswijk Castle, but the Accord of Heeswijk they agreed there was even harsher, England and France promising never to conclude a separate peace. France demanded the areas of Brabant, Limburg and Guelders. Charles tried to right matters by writing a very moderate letter to William, claiming that the only obstacle to peace was the influence of De Witt. William made counteroffers unacceptable to Charles but also on 15 August published the letter to incite the population. On 20 August, Johan and Cornelis de Witt were lynched by an Orangist civil militia, leaving William in control.

Observing that the water around &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch showed little sign of receding, Louis became impatient and lifted the siege on 26 July. Leaving his main force of 40,000 behind, he took 18,000 men with him, and marched to Paris within a week, straight through the Spanish Netherlands. He freed 12,000 Dutch prisoners of war for a small ransom, to avoid having to pay for their maintenance, allowing the majority to rejoin the Dutch States Army, which by August contained 57,000 men.

===War of attrition===
In June, the Dutch seemed defeated. The Amsterdam stock market collapsed and their international credit evaporated. Frederick William, the Elector of Brandenburg, in these circumstances hardly dared to threaten the eastern borders of Münster. A single loyal ally remained: the Spanish Netherlands. They well understood that if the Dutch capitulated, they too would be lost. Although officially neutral, and forced to allow the French to transgress their territory with impunity, they openly reinforced the Dutch with thousands of troops.

Concern at French gains brought the support of Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. Instead of a rapid victory, Louis was forced into a war of attrition around the French frontiers; in August, Turenne ended his offensive against the Dutch and proceeded to Germany with 25,000 infantry and 18,000 cavalry. Frederick William and Leopold combined their forces of around 25,000 under the Imperial general Raimondo Montecuccoli; he crossed the Rhine at Koblenz in January 1673 but Turenne forced him to retreat into northern Germany.
The faltering offensive caused financial problems for the anti-Dutch allies, especially England. Münster was in an even worse condition; on 27 August it had to abandon the siege of Groningen. Whereas the Dutch had managed to supply the city through waterways at its northern edge, Von Galen&#x27;s troops were starving and had largely deserted. Largely due to an effective guerrilla campaign by troops from Friesland under Hans Willem van Aylva against their supply lines. Also, his siege mortars had lost the artillery duel with the fortress cannon, gradually having been destroyed. Before the end of 1672, the Dutch under Carl von Rabenhaupt retook Coevorden and liberated the province of Drenthe, leaving the Allies in possession of only three of the ten—the territories of Drenthe, Staats-Brabant, and Staats-Overmaas were also part of the republic—Dutch provincial areas. The supply lines of the French army were dangerously overextended. In the autumn of 1672, William tried to cut them off, crossing the Spanish Netherlands via Maastricht in forced marches to attack Charleroi, the starting point of the supply route through Liège, though he had to abandon the siege quickly.

The absence of the Dutch field army offered opportunities for the French to renew their offensive. On 27 December, after a severe frost, Luxembourg began to cross the ice of the Water Line with eight thousand men, hoping to sack The Hague. A sudden thaw cut his force in half and he narrowly escaped to his own lines with the remainder, on his way back massacring the civilian population of Bodegraven and Zwammerdam. This increased the hatred against Luxembourg. The province of Utrecht was one of the richest regions of Europe and &quot;intendant&quot; Louis Robert had extorted large sums from its wealthy inhabitants. The French applied the not-unusual method of &quot;mettre à contribution&quot;: unless noble refugees or Amsterdam merchants made regular payments, their luxury mansions would be burnt down. This made the general the favourite subject of Dutch anti-French propaganda. Special books were published highlighting the outrages he committed, illustrated by Romeyn de Hooghe. The most common Dutch school book, the &quot;Mirror of Youth&quot;, that had been dedicated to Spanish misdeeds, was now rewritten to reflect French atrocities.

==1673==

Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water, making rivers such as the Lys, Sambre and Meuse vital for trade and military operations. The primary French objective in 1673 was the capture of Maastricht, which controlled a key access point on the Meuse; the city surrendered on 30 June. In June 1673, the French occupation of Kleve and lack of money temporarily drove Brandenburg-Prussia out of the war in the Peace of Vossem.

However, in August, the Dutch, Spain and Emperor Leopold, supported by other German states, agreed the anti-French Alliance of The Hague, joined by Charles IV of Lorraine in October. In September, the resolute defense by John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen and Aylva in the north of the Dutch Republic had now finally forced Von Galen to withdraw, while William crossed the Dutch Waterline and recaptured Naarden. In November, a 30,000-strong Dutch-Spanish army, under William&#x27;s command, marched into the lands of the Bishops of Münster and Cologne. The Dutch troops took revenge and carried out many atrocities. Together with 35,000 Imperial troops, they then captured Bonn, an important magazine in the long logistical lines between France and the Dutch Republic. The French position in the Netherlands became untenable and Louis was forced to evacuate French troops from the Dutch Republic. This deeply shocked Louis and he retreated to Saint Germain where no one, except a few intimates, were allowed to disturb him. The next year only Grave and Maastricht remained in French hands, while the war expanded into the Rhineland and Spain. Münster was forced to sign a peace treaty with the Dutch Republic in April 1674 and Cologne followed in May.

In England, the alliance with Catholic France had been unpopular from the start and although the real terms of the Treaty of Dover remained secret, many suspected them. The Cabal ministry that managed government for Charles had gambled on a short war but when this proved not to be the case, opinion quickly turned against it, while the French were also accused of abandoning the English at Solebay.
Opposition to the alliance with France further increased when Charles&#x27; heir, his Catholic brother, James, was given permission to marry Mary of Modena, also a devout Catholic. In February 1673, Parliament refused to continue funding the war unless Charles withdrew a proposed Declaration of Indulgence and accepted a Test Act barring Catholics from public office. That summer De Ruyter again defeated the Anglo-French fleets, now under Prince Rupert, at the two battles of Schooneveld and at the Battle of Texel, while a Dutch fleet in the Americas recaptured New Amsterdam from the English. Pressure to end the war mounted in England and Charles made peace in the Treaty of Westminster of February 1674.

This combination of events led Louis to pursue a &quot;policy of exhaustion that emphasised sieges and the gathering of war taxes, raids, and blockades over full-scale battles&quot;. In support of this strategy, Swedish forces in Swedish Pomerania attacked Brandenburg-Prussia in December 1674 after Louis threatened to withhold their subsidies. It resulted in the 1675–1679 Scanian War and the Swedish-Brandenburg War, whereby the Swedes tied up the armies of Brandenburg, Denmark and some minor German principalities.

Meanwhile, the French and English East India Companies had been unable to seriously undermine the strong position of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in both the intercontinental route and in intra-Asian trades. The VOC secured its position in Asia by defeating the French garrison in Trincomalee and the English in the Battle of Masulipatnam, and besieged another French force in São Tomé, which fell in 1674.

==War expands: 1674–1675==

In broad terms, French strategy now focused on retaking Spanish possessions gained in 1667–1668 but returned at Aix-La-Chapelle, while preventing Imperialist advances in the Rhineland. They also supported minor campaigns in Roussillon and Sicily that absorbed Spanish and Dutch naval resources.

===Flanders and the Franche-Comté===
In the spring of 1674, the French invaded the Spanish province of Franche-Comté and overran the entire province in less than six weeks. French troops then reinforced Condé&#x27;s army in the Spanish Netherlands, who were outnumbered by the main Allied field army. William invaded French Flanders, hoping to recapture the Spanish possession of Charleroi and take Oudenarde, but was halted by Condé at the Battle of Seneffe. While both sides claimed victory, the appalling casualties confirmed Louis&#x27; preference for positional warfare, ushering in a period where siege and manoeuvre dominated military tactics.

One of the biggest obstacles to Allied success in Flanders was their diverging objectives; the Imperials wanted to prevent reinforcements reaching Turenne in the Rhineland while the Spanish aimed at recovering losses in the Spanish Netherlands. The Dutch were further split by internal disputes; the powerful Amsterdam mercantile body were anxious to end an expensive war once their commercial interests were secured, while William saw France as a long-term threat that had to be defeated. This conflict increased once ending the war became a distinct possibility with the recapture of Grave in October 1674, leaving only Maastricht.

===Rhineland===
During the winter of 1673–1674, Turenne based his troops in Alsace and the Palatinate; despite England&#x27;s withdrawal from the war in February, his army of less than 8,000 retained a number of English regiments, as Charles II encouraged members to continue serving in order to keep his French subsidies. Monmouth and Churchill were among those who did so, while others enrolled in the Dutch Scots Brigade, including John Graham, later Viscount Dundee.

The 1674 campaign began when Turenne crossed the Rhine in June with 7,000 men, hoping to attack Charles of Lorraine before he could combine with forces under Alexander von Bournonville. At Sinsheim, the French routed a separate Imperial army led by Aeneas de Caprara but the delay allowed Bournonville to link up with Charles at Heidelberg; after receiving reinforcements, Turenne began crossing the Neckar river, forcing the Imperial troops to retreat.

Bournonville marched south to the Imperial city of Strasbourg, giving him a base for an attack on Alsace but delayed while he awaited the arrival of 20,000 troops under Frederick William. To prevent this, Turenne made a night march that enabled him to surprise the Imperial army and fought them to a standstill at Entzheim on 4 October. As was then accepted practice, Bournonville halted operations until spring but in his Winter Campaign 1674/1675, Turenne inflicted a series of defeats culminating in Turckkeim on 5 January, which secured Alsace and prevented an Imperial invasion. This campaign is often considered to be Turenne&#x27;s masterpiece.

Command of Imperial operations in the Rhineland passed to Montecuccoli, the only Allied general considered equal to Turenne. He crossed the Rhine at Philippsburg with 25,000 men, hoping to draw the French north, then double back, but Turenne was not fooled, and instead blocked the river near Strasbourg to prevent Montecuccoli being resupplied. By mid-July, both armies were running out of food and Turenne tried to bring the retreating Imperial army to battle. At Salzbach on 27 July, he was killed by a stray cannonball while reconnoitering the enemy&#x27;s positions. Demoralised by his death, the French withdrew after some inconclusive skirmishing, and fell back to Alsace. They were pursued by Montecuccoli, who crossed the Rhine at Strasbourg and besieged Hagenau, while another Imperial army defeated Créquy at Konzer Brücke and recaptured Trier. Condé was despatched from Flanders to take command and forced Montecuccoli to withdraw across the Rhine; however, ill-health forced him to retire in December and he was replaced by Créquy.

===Spain and Sicily===

Activity on this front was largely limited to skirmishing in Roussillon between a French army under Frederick von Schomberg and Spanish forces led by the Duque de San Germán. The Spanish won a minor victory at Maureillas in June 1674 and captured Fort Bellegarde, ceded to France in 1659 and retaken by Schomberg in 1675.

In Sicily, the French supported a successful revolt by the city of Messina against its Spanish overlords in 1674, obliging San Germán to transfer some of his troops. A French naval force under Jean-Baptiste de Valbelle managed to resupply the city in early 1675 and establish local naval supremacy.

===North Germany and Scandinavia===
In the 1660s and early 1670s, the Swedish Empire experienced a financial crisis. In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England signed the Treaty of Dover with France in 1670. In April 1672, Sweden and France also concluded an alliance, with France promising subsidies in peace time, and more subsidies in war time, if Sweden maintained a 16,000 men strong army in its German dominions. In December 1674 Sweden invaded Brandenburg after France had threatened to halt its subsidies if the Swedish would not use their army. In June, however, a Swedish army under Carl Gustaf Wrangel was decisively defeated by the Brandenburgian army under Frederick William at Fehrbellin. The Swedish invasion had failed and in September, Imperial and Danish forces attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden.

===War at sea===

At sea, after the peace with England, the Dutch fleet could now be deployed in an offensive manner. De Ruyter attempted an attack on the French Caribbean islands, but was forced to retreat without having achieved anything. A Dutch fleet under Cornelis Tromp meanwhile operated along the French coast. Tromp directed a landing on 27 June on the island of Belle Île, off the coast of Brittany, and captured its coastal bulwarks. The Dutch, however, left the island again after two days, because the 3,000 French defenders had taken refuge in the island&#x27;s strong fortress and a siege would have taken too long. A few days later, on 4 July, the island of Noirmoutier was attacked. After a short struggle, which left more than a hundred Dutch men out of action, the French retreated to Poitou, leaving the island, with its castle, coastal batteries, more than 30 pieces of artillery and several ships, in the hands of the Dutch. For nearly three weeks, the Dutch flag flew from the walls of the French stronghold and the Dutch fleet captured many French ships in the meantime. The whole coastline from Brest to Bayonne was in turmoil, and several strong French forces gathered to prevent the Dutch from landing. On 23 July the island of Noirmoutier was however abandoned after the Dutch blew up the castle and demolished the coastal batteries. The French coast was kept in fear for some time, but after ending the French blockade of Cádiz and visiting the Mediterranean, Tromp&#x27;s fleet returned to Holland at the end of 1674.

==Negotiating the peace: 1676–1678==
On both sides, the last years of the war saw minimal return for their investment of men and money. French strategy in Flanders was largely based on Vauban&#x27;s proposed line of fortresses known as the &quot;Ceinture de fer&quot; or iron belt (see Map). This aligned with Louis&#x27; preference for siege warfare, which was further reinforced by the death of Turenne, and Condé&#x27;s retirement, removing two of the most talented and aggressive French generals of the 17th century, and the only ones with sufficient stature to challenge him. The French were preparing a major offensive at the end of 1676. Intended to capture Valenciennes, Cambrai and Saint-Omer in the Spanish Netherlands, after which the &quot;Ceinture de fer&quot; was to be largely complete. Louis believed this would deprive the Dutch &quot;regenten&quot; of the courage to continue the war any longer. In this, however, he was mistaken. The impending French offensive actually led to an intensification of Dutch-Spanish cooperation. Still, the French offensive of 1677 was a success. The Spaniards found it difficult to raise enough troops due to financial constraints and the Allies were defeated in the Battle of Cassel. This meant that they could not prevent the cities from falling into French hands. The French then took a defensive posture, afraid that more success would force England to intervene on the side of the Allies.

In Germany, Imperial forces captured Philippsburg in September 1676 but the French stabilised their front. Créquy&#x27;s maneuvering countered Imperial offensives by Charles V of Lorraine whereas the French commander succeeded in capturing Freiburg in November 1677. Defeating the Imperials at Rheinfelden and Ortenbach in July 1678 ended their hopes of retaking the city. The French followed up by capturing Kehl and the bridge over the Rhine near Strasbourg, thus ensuring control of Alsace. The Spanish theatre remained largely static; French victory at Espolla in July 1677 left the strategic position unchanged but their losses worsened the crisis faced by the Spanish administration.

Looking to aid Spain in the defense of Sicily, the Dutch Republic sent a small fleet under command of De Ruyter to the Mediterranean Sea. De Ruyter disapproved of the operation, because he thought that his fleet was insufficient to change the balance of power in the Mediterranean, in which the French had a very strong presence. Under pressure from the admiralty he had accepted command anyway. His doubts would soon be justified, but not after he repulsed an attack of a superior French fleet under Abraham Duquesne at Stromboli. Several months later in April 1676 De Ruyter repeated this feat at the Battle of Augusta, but was mortally wounded in the process. The French would achieve naval supremacy in the Western Mediterranean after their galleys surprised the Dutch/Spanish fleet at anchor at Palermo in June. However, French intervention had been opportunistic; friction arose with the anti-Spanish rebels, the cost of operations was prohibitive and Messina was evacuated in early 1678.

In Northern Germany meanwhile the Swedish position crumbled. In 1675, most of Swedish Pomerania and the Duchy of Bremen had been taken by the Brandenburgers, Imperials, and Danes. In December 1677, the elector of Brandenburg captured Stettin. Stralsund fell on 11 October 1678. Greifswald, Sweden&#x27;s last possession on the continent, was lost on 5 November. Swedish seapower was annihilated, by the Danish and Dutch fleets under Niels Juel and Cornelis Tromp after the battles of Öland and Køge Bay, but the Danish invasion of Scania was less successful. After the very bloody Battle of Lund and the Battle of Landskrona the main body of the Danish forces was moved to southern Denmark, but the hostilities in Scania did not cease until September 1679. 

The peace talks that began at Nijmegen in 1676 were given a greater sense of urgency in November 1677 when William married his cousin Mary, Charles II of England&#x27;s niece. An Anglo-Dutch defensive alliance followed in March 1678, although English troops did not arrive in significant numbers until late May. Louis seized this opportunity to improve his negotiating position and captured Ypres and Ghent in early March, before signing a peace treaty with the Dutch on 10 August.

The Battle of Saint-Denis was fought three days later on 13 August, when a combined Dutch-Spanish force attacked the French army under Luxembourg. The French were forced to withdraw, which ensured that Mons remained in Spanish hands. On 19 August, Spain and France agreed to an armistice, followed by a formal peace treaty on 17 September.

==1678: the Peace of Nijmegen and its consequences==

Louis XIV&#x27;s two primary goals, the destruction of the Dutch Republic and the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands, had not been achieved. Nevertheless, the Peace of Nijmegen confirmed most of the conquests the French had made in the latter stages of the war. Louis, having successfully fought a powerful coalition, came to be known as the &#x27;Sun King&#x27; in the years that followed the conflict. France returned Charleroi, Ghent and other towns in the Spanish Netherlands, while receiving the entire Franche-Comté and the towns of Ypres, Maubeuge, Câteau-Cambrésis, Valenciennes, Saint-Omer and Cassel; with the exception of Ypres, all of these remain part of France today. But while favourable to France, and producing lasting gains, the peace terms were significantly worse than those that had been available in July 1672.

The Dutch recovered from the near disaster of 1672 to prove they were a significant power in Northern Europe. They ended the war without losing an inch of their own territory, obtained the French evacuation of several advanced positions conquered in 1668 and the repeal of the rigorous customs tariff of 1667, which had been designed, by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, to hinder their trade. Arguably, their most lasting gain was William&#x27;s marriage to Mary and his arrival as one of the most powerful statesmen in Europe, with sufficient stature to hold together an anti-French coalition. It also showed that while significant sections of the English mercantile and political class were anti-Dutch on commercial grounds, there was no popular support in England for an alliance with France. However, the advantageous separate peace, signed against William&#x27;s wishes, meant that the Republic&#x27;s allies were in a worse position. For years afterwards the 
Republic was burdened with the reputation of being an untrustworthy ally, concerned only with its commercial interests. The war had also seen the rebirth of the Dutch States Army as one of the most disciplined and best trained European armed forces. That this was not sufficient to keep France from making conquests in the Spanish Netherlands, William and the &quot;regenten&quot; blamed mainly on the Spanish themselves. The Dutch had expected more military strength from the once powerful Spanish Empire.

In Spain, defeat led to the Queen Regent, Mariana of Austria, being replaced by her long-term rival, the pro-French John of Austria the Younger. She returned to power after his death in September 1679 but not before he arranged the marriage of Charles II of Spain to Louis&#x27; niece, 17-year-old Marie Louise of Orléans in November 1679.

Brandenburg managed to occupy Swedish Pomerania completely in September 1678, France&#x27;s ally Sweden regained it by the 1679 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye but this did little to improve its perilous financial position. In addition, Frederick William&#x27;s resentment at being forced to give up what he saw as his own territory turned Brandenburg-Prussia into an implacable opponent.

Louis had the enormous advantages of a stellar corps of commanders, superior logistics and a unified strategy, in contrast to the differing objectives of his opponents. At the same time, the war demonstrated that the threat of French expansion overruled all other considerations for rival nations and that France, though having emerged as Europe&#x27;s greatest power, could not easily impose its will against a coalition. French forces would soon capture Strasbourg (in 1681) and triumph in the brief War of the Reunions (1683–1684), which only further alienated other European states and led to the creation of the anti-French Grand Alliance in 1688, which largely held together through the 1688–1697 Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714).

<doc id="323890" wikidata="Q2198292" url="?curid=323890" title="Triple Alliance (1668)">
<text>The Triple Alliance (; ) was signed by the Kingdom of England, the Swedish Empire and the Dutch Republic in May 1668. It was created in response to the occupation of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté by France. Although Spain and Emperor Leopold were not signatories, they were closely involved in the negotiations.

It consisted of three separate agreements: a defensive alliance, an undertaking to oblige Spain and France to make peace, and secret clauses that included mediating an end to the war between Spain and Portugal and enforcing the peace by military action if required.

By 1663, Louis XIV had accepted that French and Dutch objectives in the Low Countries were incompatible and used the Second Anglo-Dutch War to launch the War of Devolution in May 1667. He and Leopold were co-heirs to Charles of Spain, and in January 1668, they signed a treaty that divided the Spanish Empire if Charles died without an heir, and it awarded Louis the Spanish Netherlands and set the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

The alliance was short-lived since both Sweden and England backed France at the outset of the Franco-Dutch War four years later, but it marked the point at which England and the Dutch came to see France as a common threat. That made it the forerunner of the Grand Alliance, which fought the 1688-1697 Nine Years&#x27; War and the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession.

==Background==
As part of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees that ended the Franco-Spanish War, Louis XIV of France married Maria Theresa of Spain, eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the Spanish Empire remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by France, Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights and in return Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold écus, a huge sum that was never paid.

In 1661, French Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert argued economic growth required possession of the Spanish Netherlands and the port of Antwerp. Acquisition would give France control of its own export trade, currently dominated by the Dutch Republic, a long-time ally. However, this implied conflict with Spain, Emperor Leopold as well as the Dutch. The 1648 Peace of Münster that confirmed independence from Spain shut the Scheldt estuary, closing Antwerp and making Amsterdam the richest commercial city in North Western Europe. Keeping it shut was a Dutch priority.

By 1663, Louis had concluded the States General of the Netherlands would never voluntarily agree to concessions and began planning to seize the area by force. As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the Second Anglo-Dutch War in July 1665; this gave Louis an excuse to expand his army, while he also calculated it would make harder for the Dutch to oppose him.

In September, Philip died, leaving his four-year-old son Charles II of Spain as king, and his widow, Mariana of Austria, as regent. Louis argued since the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa&#x27;s renunciation was invalid and so her rights &quot;devolved&quot; to him under the &quot;Jus Devolutionis&quot;, an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. He used it to claim much of the Spanish Netherlands. In April 1666, Charles&#x27; sister Margaret Theresa married Emperor Leopold; this meant on his death, Leopold would inherit the entire Spanish Empire.

Talks on ending the Anglo-Dutch War opened in Breda in May 1667. Louis launched the War of Devolution on 24 May, and by September, his troops had occupied much of the Spanish Netherlands. On 27 May, the Treaty of Madrid ended the 1654-1660 Anglo-Spanish War, and England agreed to mediate an end to the Portuguese Restoration War in return for commercial concessions. The Dutch raid on the Medway in June forced England to agree to the Treaty of Breda on 31 July, and negotiations then began between the two countries for a common front against France.

==Negotiations==
For De Witt, the French alliance secured his position against the Orangist opposition and ensured Dutch economic supremacy. By 1667, the prospect of France replacing Spain as a neighbour meant that most of the States General and the Dutch populace saw an English alliance as essential for mutual survival. Although Charles preferred France as an ally, he viewed Breda as a personal humiliation and blamed Louis, who failed to deliver on a promise to ensure that the Dutch accepted English terms. This perspective was widely shared by his advisors, including chief minister Lord Arlington, many of whom also viewed Spain as a better ally than France. Losses from war and the Great Fire of London meant both Parliament and the City of London wanted peace, which seemed best achieved by partnering with the Dutch.

Negotiations were led by Sir William Temple, English ambassador in The Hague and Brussels, who viewed French expansion as a bigger threat than Dutch economic strength. He was supported by François-Paul de Lisola; he served as an imperial diplomat in London from 1667 to 1668 and The Hague from 1669 to 1673. Historian and political theorist Mark Goldie views Lisola&#x27;s 1667 work &#x27;The Buckler of State and Justice&#x27; as a key document in establishing France as England&#x27;s enemy, rather than Spain.
In September, De Witt asked Louis his conditions for withdrawing from the Spanish Netherlands and offered to mediate with Spain to ensure their acceptance. Louis agreed, but only if the Dutch enforced them on both parties; this meant when Spain rejected his terms, the States of Holland passed resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military support for France. On 20 January 1668, Louis and Leopold agreed to a secret Partition Treaty, dividing the Spanish Empire if Charles died.

The French ambassador, Godefroi, Comte d&#x27;Estrades, was well-informed on negotiations for the Alliance and assured Louis that he could delay approval by bribes. However, Temple persuaded the States General to approve it before asking the provincial bodies although normal practice was the other way around. Once the States General announced their decision, public enthusiasm was so great that no one dared take d&#x27;Estrades&#x27; money. On 23 January 1668, the Alliance was signed by England and the Republic. Seeking to widen the coalition, Temple invited Sweden to join; it had signed a treaty with the Dutch in July 1667 and controlled the Baltic trade in pitch and timber, essential for shipbuilding.

==Terms==
The Alliance contained three separate elements; a defensive alliance, a guarantee of terms for ending the War of Devolution and secret clauses. Spain was held partially responsible for the war by arranging the 1666 marriage between Leopold and Margaret Theresa and so had to bear some of the cost. As agreed in September, France would withdraw from the Spanish Netherlands but retain Lille, Armentières, Bergues, Douai Tournai, Oudenaarde, Kortrijk, Veurne, Binche, Charleroi, and Ath.

The Alliance guaranteed to enforce compliance by Spain by a secret clause requiring it to end the war with Portugal. With Louis clearly preparing action, another clause committed to forcing France back to its 1659 boundaries if it continued the war. The English Parliament approved £300,000 if needed, and the States General activated 48 warships, and the recruitment of 18,000 additional troops. As a condition of signing, Sweden demanded reimbursement of 480,000 rixdollars, costs incurred for its attempt to capture Bremen in 1666, which it claimed was for the benefit of Spain. The Dutch and the English refused to pay and passed the obligation onto Spain; after protracted debate, Sweden signed on 5 May (NS), bringing together the three major powers in the Baltic and North Sea.

==Aftermath==
French troops entered Franche-Comté on 5 February; two weeks later, its conquest was complete and Louis decided to make peace. The cost of the war was far higher than expected, while Charles of Spain was reportedly close to death; if so, his agreement with Leopold meant Louis might achieve his objectives without fighting. In April, he met with English and Dutch representatives at Saint Germain to agree to terms, which were used at Aix-la-Chapelle in May. In Article 6, the Dutch and English undertook to enforce them if Spain did not comply, mirroring the &#x27;secret&#x27; clause of the alliance against France. In reality, there was no English support for war with Spain on behalf of France or the Dutch, especially given the commercial terms of the 1667 Treaty of Madrid; besides, the Royal Navy was in no state to fight a war.

In the short term, the Triple Alliance was undermined by diverging interests. De Witt and Charles saw it as a way to improve their bargaining position with Louis, a perspective at odds with domestic opinion in both countries, which was strongly anti-French. In addition, the English were pro-peace, rather than pro-Dutch, and unresolved commercial disputes resulted in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. For Sweden, it was an opportunity to replace its regional rival Denmark-Norway as the primary Dutch ally in the Baltic, and end concessions imposed by the 1656 Treaty of Elbing.

However, the treaty marked the end of the longstanding Franco-Dutch alliance and the first step in creating the anti-French coalition that continued until the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714. The balance of power concept advocated by Temple had two important implications for English policy: the ability to enforce it and a network of allies. From 1668 to 1674, Parliament voted large sums to strengthen the Royal Navy, and English diplomacy began to focus on powers like Sweden, Brandenburg and Denmark, instead of only Spain, the Dutch, France or the Holy Roman Empire.

De Witt hoped the threat of the Triple Alliance would force Louis to moderate his demands, but it simply showed the limits of his ability to control the States General. The Treaties of Breda and the Alliance were viewed as Dutch diplomatic triumphs, but while although De Witt understood the danger of thwarting French ambitions, he failed to convince his colleagues. Louis now decided the best way to acquire the Spanish Netherlands was to defeat the Dutch and began preparations for the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War.

<text>Luperosaurus is a genus of lizards, commonly known as camouflage geckos, fringed geckos, wolf geckos, and flap-legged geckos, in the family Gekkonidae. The genus is native to Southeast Asia.

==Geographic range==
Species in the genus &quot;Luperosaurus&quot; are found in the Southeast Asian mainland and archipelago, extending from the Malay Peninsula, through the Philippines and Indonesia.

==Description==
These are small geckos, characterized by the flaps of skin on the front and rear of their limbs and sometimes, along their bodies.

==Taxonomy==
The original spelling intended was &quot;Lyperosaurus&quot; (= vexing gecko), for possessing characters from two different genera known to John Edward Gray, who named the genus. Most species of &quot;Lupersaurus&quot; are known from one or a few specimens.

==Behavior==
Members of the genus &quot;Luperosaurus&quot; are presumably highly arboreal.

==Species==
The following 9 species are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Luperosaurus angliit&quot; 
*&quot;Luperosaurus corfieldi&quot; – Corfield&#x27;s fringed gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus cumingii&quot; – Philippine fringed gecko, Philippine wolf gecko, Cuming&#x27;s flap-legged gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus joloensis&quot; – Taylor&#x27;s wolf gecko, Jolo flapped-legged gecko, Taylor&#x27;s fringed gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus kubli&quot; 
*&quot;Luperosaurus macgregori&quot; – MacGregor&#x27;s wolf gecko, McGregor&#x27;s flapped-legged gecko, MacGregor&#x27;s fringed gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus palawanensis&quot; – Palawan wolf gecko, Palawan flapped-legged gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus yasumai&quot; – fringed gecko
*&quot;Luperosaurus brooksii&quot;
(Boulenger, 1920) - Brooks&#x27;s wolf gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Luperosaurus&quot;.

<text>Joseph Joachim Raff (27 May 182224 or 25 June 1882) was a German-Swiss composer, pedagogue and pianist.

==Biography==
Raff was born in Lachen in Switzerland. His father, a teacher, had fled there from Württemberg in 1810 to escape forced recruitment into the military of that southwestern German state that had to fight for Napoleon in Russia. Joachim was largely self-taught in music, studying the subject while working as a schoolmaster in Schmerikon, Schwyz and Rapperswil. He sent some of his piano compositions to Felix Mendelssohn who recommended them to Breitkopf &amp; Härtel for publication. They were published in 1844 and received a favourable review in Robert Schumann&#x27;s journal, the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, which prompted Raff to go to Zürich and take up composition full-time.

In 1845, Raff walked to Basel to hear Franz Liszt play the piano. After a period in Stuttgart where he became friends with the conductor Hans von Bülow, he worked as Liszt&#x27;s assistant at Weimar from 1850 to 1853. During this time he helped Liszt in the orchestration of several of his works, claiming to have had a major part in orchestrating the symphonic poem &quot;Tasso&quot;. In 1851, Raff&#x27;s opera &quot;König Alfred&quot; was staged in Weimar, and five years later he moved to Wiesbaden where he largely devoted himself to composition. From 1878 he was the first Director of, and a teacher at, the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. There he employed Clara Schumann and a number of other eminent musicians as teachers, and established a class specifically for female composers. (This was at a time when women composers were not taken seriously.) His pupils there included Edward MacDowell and Alexander Ritter. 
He died in Frankfurt on the night of June 24/25, 1882. His tomb is in Frankfurt Main Cemetery.

==Compositions==

Raff was very prolific, and by the end of his life was one of the best known German composers, though his work is largely forgotten today. (Only one piece, a cavatina for violin and piano, is performed with any regularity today, sometimes as an encore.) He drew influence from a variety of sources - his eleven symphonies, for example, combine the Classical symphonic form, with the Romantic penchant for program music and contrapuntal orchestral writing which harks back to the Baroque. Most of these symphonies carry descriptive titles including &quot;In the Forest&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Lenore&quot; (No. 5) and &quot;To the Fatherland&quot; (No. 1), a very large-scale work lasting around seventy minutes. His last four symphonies make up a quartet of works based on the four seasons. A complete cycle of all his symphonies and many other orchestral works was recorded in the early 2000s by the Bamberg Symphony under Hans Stadlmair.

Raff&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 &quot;In the Forest&quot; was enthusiastically received by the audience at that time, spread quickly to England and America and was one of the most played orchestral pieces in the world at the end of the 19th century. It fell into oblivion together with Raff himself, but influenced many later romantic composers including Tchaikovsky in his famous &quot;Pathétique&quot; for example. Arturo Toscanini conducted some performances of the symphony in 1931.

The &quot;Lenore&quot; symphony (No. 5), famous in its time, was inspired by a ballad of the same name by Gottfried August Bürger that also inspired works by several other composers, including Maria Theresia von Paradis (1789), Henri Duparc, Franz Liszt (late 1850s, mentioned by Alan Walker in his Liszt biography vol. 2), for example. The world premiere recording of &quot;Lenore&quot; was made in 1970 by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bernard Herrmann, who championed Raff&#x27;s orchestral music. He described it as &quot;one of the finest examples of the Romantic Programme School - it deserves a place alongside the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; of Berlioz, Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; and the &quot;Manfred Symphony&quot; of Tchaikovsky&quot;.

Richard Strauss was a pupil of Hans von Bülow, a friend of Raff&#x27;s, and it has been said that Strauss was influenced in his early works by Raff. For example, Raff&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 &quot;In the Alps&quot; (1877) could have been an inspiration to Strauss&#x27;s &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot; (1915). Much of Raff&#x27;s music has been said to forecast the early works of Jean Sibelius.

Raff also composed in most other genres, including concertos, opera, chamber music and works for solo piano. His chamber works include five violin sonatas, a cello sonata, a piano quintet, two piano quartets, eight string quartets, a string sextet and four piano trios. Many of these works are now commercially recorded. He also wrote numerous suites, some for smaller groups (there are suites for piano solo and suites for string quartet), some for orchestra and one each for piano and orchestra and violin and orchestra.

<text>Afrasiyab ( &quot;afrāsiyāb&quot;; ; Middle-Persian: &quot;Frāsiyāv, Frāsiyāk&quot;) is the name of the mythical king and hero of Turan. He is the main antagonist of the Persian epic Shahnameh, written by Ferdowsi.

==The mythical king and hero==

According to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;), by the Persian epic poet Ferdowsi, Afrasiab was the king and hero of Turan and an archenemy of Iran. In Iranian mythology, Afrasiab is considered by far the most prominent of all Turanian kings; he is a formidable warrior, a skilful general, and an agent of Ahriman, who is endowed with magical powers of deception to destroy Iranian civilization. He is brother to Garsivaz, and the son of Pashang. He was an enemy of Rostam and Kay Khosrow, and was defeated by them.

According to Islamic sources, Afrasiab was a descendant of Tūr (Avestan: &quot;Tūriya-&quot;), one of the three sons of the Iranian mythical King Fereydun (the other two sons being Salm and Iraj). In &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, he is named as the seventh grandson of Tūr. In Avestan traditions, his common epithet &quot;mairya-&quot; (deceitful, villainous) can be interpreted as meaning &#x27;an evil man&#x27;. He lived in a subterranean fortress made of metal, called Hanakana.

According to Avestan sources, Afrasiab was killed by Haoma near the &quot;Čīčhast&quot; (possibly either referring to Lake Hamun in Sistan or some unknown lake in today&#x27;s Central Asia), and according to Shahnameh he met his death in a cave known as the Hang-e Afrasiab, or the dying place of Afrasiab, on a mountaintop in Azerbaijan. The fugitive Afrasiab, having been repeatedly defeated by the armies of his adversary, the mythical King of Iran Kay Khosrow (who happened to be his own grandson, through his daughter Farangis), wandered wretchedly and fearfully around, and eventually took refuge in this cave and died.

== Hypotheses ==
Ernst Hertzfeld believed that the name Parsondes is etymologically identical to the name Afrasiab. Tabari in his works mentions the derivative Afrasiab / Aspandiat under the name of the Hephtalite king Akhshunvar or Akhshunvaz.

<doc id="323912" wikidata="Q1458822" url="?curid=323912" title="Cultural ecology">
<text>Cultural ecology is the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments. Human adaptation refers to both biological and cultural processes that enable a population to survive and reproduce within a given or changing environment. This may be carried out diachronically (examining entities that existed in different epochs), or synchronically (examining a present system and its components). The central argument is that the natural environment, in small scale or subsistence societies dependent in part upon it, is a major contributor to social organization and other human institutions. In the academic realm, when combined with study of political economy, the study of economies as polities, it becomes political ecology, another academic subfield. It also helps interrogate historical events like the Easter Island Syndrome.

==History ==
Anthropologist Julian Steward (1902-1972) coined the term, envisioning cultural ecology as a methodology for understanding how humans adapt to such a wide variety of environments. In his &quot;Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution&quot; (1955), cultural ecology represents the &quot;ways in which culture change is induced by adaptation to the environment&quot;. A key point is that any particular human adaptation is in part historically inherited and involves the technologies, practices, and knowledge that allow people to live in an environment. This means that while the environment influences the character of human adaptation, it does not determine it. In this way, Steward wisely separated the vagaries of the environment from the inner workings of a culture that occupied a given environment. Viewed over the long term, this means that environment and culture are on more or less separate evolutionary tracks and that the ability of one to influence the other is dependent on how each is structured. It is this assertion - that the physical and biological environment affects culture - that has proved controversial, because it implies an element of environmental determinism over human actions, which some social scientists find problematic, particularly those writing from a Marxist perspective. Cultural ecology recognizes that ecological locale plays a significant role in shaping the cultures of a region.

Steward&#x27;s method was to:

#Document the technologies and methods used to exploit the environment to get a living from it.
#Look at patterns of human behavior/culture associated with using the environment.
#Assess how much these patterns of behavior influenced other aspects of culture (e.g., how, in a drought-prone region, great concern over rainfall patterns meant this became central to everyday life, and led to the development of a religious belief system in which rainfall and water figured very strongly. This belief system may not appear in a society where good rainfall for crops can be taken for granted, or where irrigation was practiced).

Steward&#x27;s concept of cultural ecology became widespread among anthropologists and archaeologists of the mid-20th century, though they would later be critiqued for their environmental determinism. Cultural ecology was one of the central tenets and driving factors in the development of processual archaeology in the 1960s, as archaeologists understood cultural change through the framework of technology and its effects on environmental adaptation.

==In anthropology==

Cultural ecology as developed by Steward is a major subdiscipline of anthropology. It derives from the work of Franz Boas and has branched out to cover a number of aspects of human society, in particular the distribution of wealth and power in a society, and how that affects such behaviour as hoarding or gifting (e.g. the tradition of the potlatch on the Northwest North American coast).

==As transdisciplinary project==

One 2000s-era conception of cultural ecology is as a general theory that regards ecology as a paradigm not only for the natural and human sciences, but for cultural studies as well. In his &quot;Die Ökologie des Wissens&quot; (The Ecology of Knowledge), Peter Finke explains that this theory brings together the various cultures of knowledge that have evolved in history, and that have been separated into more and more specialized disciplines and subdisciplines in the evolution of modern science (Finke 2005). In this view, cultural ecology considers the sphere of human culture not as separate from but as interdependent with and transfused by ecological processes and natural energy cycles. At the same time, it recognizes the relative independence and self-reflexive dynamics of cultural processes. As the dependency of culture on nature, and the ineradicable presence of nature in culture, are gaining interdisciplinary attention, the difference between cultural evolution and natural evolution is increasingly acknowledged by cultural ecologists. Rather than genetic laws, information and communication have become major driving forces of cultural evolution (see Finke 2006, 2007). Thus, causal deterministic laws do not apply to culture in a strict sense, but there are nevertheless productive analogies that can be drawn between ecological and cultural processes.

Gregory Bateson was the first to draw such analogies in his project of an Ecology of Mind (Bateson 1973), which was based on general principles of complex dynamic life processes, e.g. the concept of feedback loops, which he saw as operating both between the mind and the world and within the mind itself. Bateson thinks of the mind neither as an autonomous metaphysical force nor as a mere neurological function of the brain, but as a &quot;dehierarchized concept of a mutual dependency between the (human) organism and its (natural) environment, subject and object, culture and nature&quot;, and thus as &quot;a synonym for a cybernetic system of information circuits that are relevant for the survival of the species.&quot; (Gersdorf/ Mayer 2005: 9).

Finke fuses these ideas with concepts from systems theory. He describes the various sections and subsystems of society as &#x27;cultural ecosystems&#x27; with their own processes of production, consumption, and reduction of energy (physical as well as psychic energy). This also applies to the cultural ecosystems of art and of literature, which follow their own internal forces of selection and self-renewal, but also have an important function within the cultural system as a whole (see next section).

==In literary studies==

The interrelatedness between culture and nature has been a special focus of literary culture from its archaic beginnings in myth, ritual, and oral story-telling, in legends and fairy tales, in the genres of pastoral literature, nature poetry. Important texts in this tradition include the stories of mutual transformations between human and nonhuman life, most famously collected in Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses, which became a highly influential text throughout literary history and across different cultures. This attention to culture-nature interaction became especially prominent in the era of romanticism, but continues to be characteristic of literary stagings of human experience up to the present.

The mutual opening and symbolic reconnection of culture and nature, mind and body, human and nonhuman life in a holistic and yet radically pluralistic way seems to be one significant mode in which literature functions and in which literary knowledge is produced. From this perspective, literature can itself be described as the symbolic medium of a particularly powerful form of &quot;cultural ecology&quot; (Zapf 2002). Literary texts have staged and explored, in ever new scenarios, the complex feedback relationship of prevailing cultural systems with the needs and manifestations of human and nonhuman &quot;nature.&quot; From this paradoxical act of creative regression they have derived their specific power of innovation and cultural self-renewal.

German ecocritic Hubert Zapf argues that literature draws its cognitive and creative potential from a threefold dynamics in its relationship to the larger cultural system: as a &quot;cultural-critical metadiscourse,&quot; an &quot;imaginative counterdiscourse,&quot; and a &quot;reintegrative interdiscourse&quot; (Zapf 2001, 2002). It is a textual form which breaks up ossified social structures and ideologies, symbolically empowers the marginalized, and reconnects what is culturally separated. In that way, literature counteracts economic, political or pragmatic forms of interpreting and instrumentalizing human life, and breaks up one-dimensional views of the world and the self, opening them up towards their repressed or excluded other. Literature is thus, on the one hand, a sensorium for what goes wrong in a society, for the biophobic, life-paralyzing implications of one-sided forms of consciousness and civilizational uniformity, and it is, on the other hand, a medium of constant cultural self-renewal, in which the neglected biophilic energies can find a symbolic space of expression and of (re-)integration into the larger ecology of cultural discourses. This approach has been applied and widened in volumes of essays by scholars from over the world (ed. Zapf 2008, 2016), as well as in a recent monograph (Zapf 2016). Similar approaches have also been developed in adjacent fields, such as film studies (Paalman 2011).

==In geography==
In geography, cultural ecology developed in response to the &quot;landscape morphology&quot; approach of Carl O. Sauer. Sauer&#x27;s school was criticized for being unscientific and later for holding a &quot;reified&quot; or &quot;superorganic&quot; conception of culture. Cultural ecology applied ideas from ecology and systems theory to understand the adaptation of humans to their environment. These cultural ecologists focused on flows of energy and materials, examining how beliefs and institutions in a culture regulated its interchanges with the natural ecology that surrounded it. In this perspective humans were as much a part of the ecology as any other organism. Important practitioners of this form of cultural ecology include Karl Butzer and David Stoddart.

The second form of cultural ecology introduced decision theory from agricultural economics, particularly inspired by the works of Alexander Chayanov and Ester Boserup. These cultural ecologists were concerned with how human groups made decisions about how they use their natural environment. They were particularly concerned with the question of agricultural intensification, refining the competing models of Thomas Malthus and Boserup. Notable cultural ecologists in this second tradition include Harold Brookfield and Billie Lee Turner II. Starting in the 1980s, cultural ecology came under criticism from political ecology. Political ecologists charged that cultural ecology ignored the connections between the local-scale systems they studied and the global political economy. Today few geographers self-identify as cultural ecologists, but ideas from cultural ecology have been adopted and built on by political ecology, land change science, and sustainability science.

==Conceptual views==

===Human species===
Books about culture and ecology began to emerge in the 1950s and 1960s. One of the first to be published in the United Kingdom was &quot;The Human Species&quot; by a zoologist, Anthony Barnett. It came out in 1950-subtitled &quot;The biology of man&quot; but was about a much narrower subset of topics. It dealt with the cultural bearing of some outstanding areas of environmental knowledge about health and disease, food, the sizes and quality of human populations, and the diversity of human types and their abilities. Barnett&#x27;s view was that his selected areas of information &quot;...are all topics on which knowledge is not only desirable, but for a twentieth-century adult, necessary&quot;. He went on to point out some of the concepts underpinning human ecology towards the social problems facing his readers in the 1950s as well as the assertion that human nature cannot change, what this statement could mean, and whether it is true. The third chapter deals in more detail with some aspects of human genetics.

Then come five chapters on the evolution of man, and the differences between groups of men (or races) and between individual men and women today in relation to population growth (the topic of &#x27;human diversity&#x27;). Finally, there is a series of chapters on various aspects of human populations (the topic of &quot;life and death&quot;). Like other animals man must, in order to survive, overcome the dangers of starvation and infection; at the same time he must be fertile. Four chapters therefore deal with food, disease and the growth and decline of human populations.

Barnett anticipated that his personal scheme might be criticized on the grounds that it omits an account of those human characteristics, which distinguish humankind most clearly, and sharply from other animals. That is to say, the point might be expressed by saying that human behaviour is ignored; or some might say that human psychology is left out, or that no account is taken of the human mind. He justified his limited view, not because little importance was attached to what was left out, but because the omitted topics were so important that each needed a book of similar size even for a summary account. In other words, the author was embedded in a world of academic specialists and therefore somewhat worried about taking a partial conceptual, and idiosyncratic view of the zoology of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

===Ecology of man===
Moves to produce prescriptions for adjusting human culture to ecological realities were also afoot in North America. In his 1957 Condon Lecture at the University of Oregon, entitled &quot;The Ecology of Man&quot;, American ecologist Paul Sears called for &quot;serious attention to the ecology of man&quot; and demanded &quot;its skillful application to human affairs&quot;. Sears was one of the few prominent ecologists to successfully write for popular audiences. Sears documents the mistakes American farmers made in creating conditions that led to the disastrous Dust Bowl. This book gave momentum to the soil conservation movement in the United States.

The &quot;ecology of man&quot; as a limiting factor which &quot;should be respected&quot;, placing boundaries around the extent to which the human species can be manipulated, is reflected in the views of Popes Benedict XVI, and Francis.

===Impact on nature===
During this same time was J.A. Lauwery&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Impact on Nature&quot;, which was part of a series on &#x27;Interdependence in Nature&#x27; published in 1969. Both Russel&#x27;s and Lauwerys&#x27; books were about cultural ecology, although not titled as such. People still had difficulty in escaping from their labels. Even &quot;Beginnings and Blunders&quot;, produced in 1970 by the polymath zoologist Lancelot Hogben, with the subtitle &quot;Before Science Began&quot;, clung to anthropology as a traditional reference point. However, its slant makes it clear that &#x27;cultural ecology&#x27; would be a more apt title to cover his wide-ranging description of how early societies adapted to environment with tools, technologies and social groupings. In 1973 the physicist Jacob Bronowski produced &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;, which summarised a magnificent thirteen part BBC television series about all the ways in which humans have moulded the Earth and its future.

===Changing the Earth===
By the 1980s the human ecological-functional view had prevailed. It had become a conventional way to present scientific concepts in the ecological perspective of human animals dominating an overpopulated world, with the practical aim of producing a greener culture. This is exemplified by I. G. Simmons&#x27; book &quot;Changing the Face of the Earth&quot;, with its telling subtitle &quot;Culture, Environment History&quot; which was published in 1989. Simmons was a geographer, and his book was a tribute to the influence of W.L Thomas&#x27; edited collection, &quot;Man&#x27;s role in &#x27;Changing the Face of the Earth&quot; that came out in 1956.

Simmons&#x27; book was one of many interdisciplinary culture/environment publications of the 1970s and 1980s, which triggered a crisis in geography with regards its subject matter, academic sub-divisions, and boundaries. This was resolved by officially adopting conceptual frameworks as an approach to facilitate the organisation of research and teaching that cuts cross old subject divisions. Cultural ecology is in fact a conceptual arena that has, over the past six decades allowed sociologists, physicists, zoologists and geographers to enter common intellectual ground from the sidelines of their specialist subjects.

===21st Century===
In the first decade of the 21st century, there are publications dealing with the ways in which humans can develop a more acceptable cultural relationship with the environment. An example is sacred ecology, a sub-topic of cultural ecology, produced by Fikret Berkes in 1999. It seeks lessons from traditional ways of life in Northern Canada to shape a new environmental perception for urban dwellers. This particular conceptualisation of people and environment comes from various cultural levels of local knowledge about species and place, resource management systems using local experience, social institutions with their rules and codes of behaviour, and a world view through religion, ethics and broadly defined belief systems.

Despite the differences in information concepts, all of the publications carry the message that culture is a balancing act between the mindset devoted to the exploitation of natural resources and that, which conserves them. Perhaps the best model of cultural ecology in this context is, paradoxically, the mismatch of culture and ecology that have occurred when Europeans suppressed the age-old native methods of land use and have tried to settle European farming cultures on soils manifestly incapable of supporting them. There is a sacred ecology associated with environmental awareness, and the task of cultural ecology is to inspire urban dwellers to develop a more acceptable sustainable cultural relationship with the environment that supports them.

===Educational framework===
===Cultural Core===
To further develop the field of Cultural Ecology, Julian Steward developed a framework which he referred to as the &quot;cultural core&quot;. This framework, a “constellation” as Steward describes it, organizes the fundamental features of a culture that are most closely related to subsistence and economic arrangements. 

At the core of this framework is the fundamental human-environment relationship as it pertains to subsistence. Outside of the core, in the second layer, lies the innumerable direct features of this relationship - tools, knowledge, economics, labor, etc. Outside of that second, directly correlated layer is the less-direct but still influential layer, typically associated with larger historical, institutional, political or social factors. 

According to Steward, the secondary features are determined greatly by the “cultural-historical factors” and they contribute to building the uniqueness of the outward appearance of cultures when compared to others with similar cores. The field of Cultural Ecology is able to utilize the cultural core framework as a tool for better determining and understanding the features that are most closely involved in the utilization of the environment by humans and cultural groups.

<text>Pseudogonatodes is a genus of sphaerodactylid geckos, often known as South American clawed geckos, containing seven described species. Like most sphaerodactylines (South American sphaerodactylids), &quot;Pseudogonatodes&quot; are miniaturized geckos and among the smallest living lizards. They are diurnal and terrestrial, foraging among leaf litter and rotting wood on the ground. Prey items are primarily small arthropods such as springtails, insect larvae, and orthopterans (crickets and kin). Though locally common and not strongly threatened with extinction, most species occupy restricted ranges in remote tropical forests. The most widespread and well-studied species, &quot;Pseudogonatodes guianensis&quot;, is found throughout the Amazon rainforest.

==Species==
The following species and subspecies are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes barbouri&quot; – Barbour&#x27;s clawed gecko
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes furvus&quot; – Colombian clawed gecko
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes gasconi&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes guianensis&quot; – Amazon pigmy gecko
**&quot;Pseudogonatodes guianensis amazonicus&quot; – Amazonas Guyana clawed gecko
**&quot;Pseudogonatodes guianensis guianensis&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes lunulatus&quot; – Venezuela clawed gecko
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes manessi&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudogonatodes peruvianus&quot; – Peru clawed gecko

<text>Ptenopus is a small genus of lizards, known commonly as barking geckos, in the family Gekkonidae. The genus is endemic to southern Africa. There are only three described species in this genus.

==Species and subspecies==
The following species and subspecies are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Ptenopus carpi&quot; – Carp&#x27;s barking gecko, Namib chirping gecko
*&quot;Ptenopus garrulus&quot; – common barking gecko, whistling gecko
**&quot;Ptenopus garrulus garrulus&quot; 
**&quot;Ptenopus garrulus maculatus&quot; 
*&quot;Ptenopus kochi&quot; – interdune barking gecko, Koch&#x27;s barking gecko, Koch&#x27;s chirping gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority or a trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Ptenopus&quot;. 

==Description==
The genus &quot;Ptenopus&quot; is in several ways atypical of the family Gekkonidae. The toes have neither pads nor expanded tips; instead they have well-developed claws and they are fringed with comb-like scales that assist in rapid motion over sand, and perhaps in digging. 
&lt;br&gt;The name &quot;Ptenopus&quot; is from classical Greek and means &quot;feather-foot&quot;, referring to the fringes on the toes.

In build the body and tail are only moderately plump, roughly cylindrical without special frills. The tail tapers to a point, but as is common among geckos, it commonly has been partly shed by the time the animal is fully grown, and the distal part commonly is a regenerated replacement. The animal is of modest size for a gecko, typically in body length. The head plus tail add about a similar length, so that a typical specimen might measure roughly in total length. As in most geckos, the tail commonly is swollen with fat stores, but not as much so as most species, such as say, in the genera &quot;Chondrodactylus&quot; and &quot;Pachydactylus&quot;.

The profile of the head is blunt, the snout being rounded, reminiscent of the genera &quot;Chondrodactylus&quot; and &quot;Pachydactylus&quot;. The eyes are prominent and wide-set, sited distinctly far forward over the short muzzle, and they have vertical pupils without the pinholes to be seen in, for example, the pupils of many species of &quot;Pachydactylus&quot;. The body and tail are cylindrical and the tail tapers to a point. The scales are small and granular and have no keels. The colour ranges from off-white or mottled yellow to chestnut brown, with irregular blotches and speckles. The ventral scales are generally white, but males of all species and females of &quot;Ptenopus carpi&quot; have yellow throats.

==Biology==
Barking geckos dig burrows up to a metre long. During the day they plug their burrows for protection from heat and predators. The name &quot;barking gecko&quot; refers to the territorial calls of males. During summer males sit at the mouths of their burrows in the dusk and on overcast days, and with only their heads showing, they call &quot;kek-kek-kek&quot; for hours on end. The call of each of the species has its own characteristic pitch. Apart from territorial defence, the calls attract females. A female that has chosen a mate will enter his burrow, and after mating she takes it over. He leaves and digs himself a new burrow. Usually she lays a single egg in such a burrow and leaves soon after. As is typical of geckos, the egg is hard-shelled.

Because of the importance of their burrows in their biology, barking geckos can only live in areas where they can dig their burrows. They depend on sand or silt that is fine enough, and firm enough to dig. Dunes of loose sand will not do, and neither will hard nor stony ground, nor thick grass. They prefer sparsely vegetated sandy soil, or silt in dry riverbeds. In suitable spots, they sometimes congregate densely, with many burrows in a small area. However solitary burrows are not unusual.

At night after rain showers, such as in the weather in which termites undertake their nuptial flights, barking geckos commonly leave their burrows to hunt actively for prey. During the brief season when the termites take to flight, they form an important part of the geckos&#x27; nutrition. At other times of the year, the geckos are mainly ambush predators, awaiting prey at the burrow entrance and sallying forth opportunistically.

==Geographic range==
Barking geckos are endemic to the arid western parts of Southern Africa. &lt;br&gt;&quot;Ptenopus garrulus&quot; has the largest geographic range, from Northern Cape, most of southern Namibia, and the southern half of Botswana, to northwest Limpopo.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ptenopus carpi&quot; occurs only in the Namib Desert from the Kuiseb River northwards to about opposite Etosha. &lt;br&gt; &quot;Ptenopus kochi&quot; occurs between the Kuiseb River southwards to Lüderitz.

<text>Ptychozoon was a genus of arboreal geckos, endemic to Southeast Asia, known commonly as flying geckos, gliding geckos, or parachute geckos. They all are now placed in the genus Gekko in the family Gekkonidae. The biogeographic history of the genus &quot;Ptychozoon&quot; was deeply nested within that of the genus &quot;Gekko&quot;, the center of diversity of which is within Southeast Asia. Since dispersing into Southeast Asian rainforests, &quot;Pytochozoon&quot;, like other forest-dwelling vertebrates, adapted to facilitate gliding. All species in the genus &quot;Ptychozoon&quot; are characterized by cryptic coloration and elaborate webs surrounding the neck, limbs, trunk, and tail. These membranes help to conceal the gecko against trees. When the gecko leaps into the air, the flaps are used to generate lift and allow the gecko to control its fall. It can glide up to . Also it does a swoop at the end of its glide to land softly. A similar adaptation is found in geckos of the genus &quot;Cosymbotus&quot;. There were thirteen described species in the genus &quot;Ptychozoon&quot;.

<text>Quedenfeldtia is a small genus containing two attractive lizard species, both commonly known as the Atlas day gecko, in the family Sphaerodactylidae. The genus is endemic to the Atlas Mountains of northwestern Africa. Despite their common name, they are not part of the day gecko genus (&quot;Phelsuma&quot;) and do not resemble them in any way.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Quedenfeldtia&quot;, is in honor of German naturalist Max Quedenfeldt (1851–1891).

==Species==
Two species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Quedenfeldtia moerens&quot; – Atlas day gecko
*&quot;Quedenfeldtia trachyblepharus&quot; – Atlas day gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Quedenfeldtia&quot;.

<text>() is a Latin phrase which literally means &quot;whose realm, his religion&quot; – meaning that the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled. This legal principle marked a major development in the collective (if not individual) freedom of religion within Western civilization. Before tolerance of individual religious divergences became accepted, most statesmen and political theorists took it for granted that religious diversity was wrong and/or weakened a state – and particularly weakened ecclesiastically-transmitted control and monitoring in a state. The principle of was a compromise in the conflict between this paradigm of statecraft and the emerging trend toward religious pluralism (coexistence within a single territory) developing throughout the German-speaking lands of the Holy Roman Empire. It permitted assortative migration of adherents to two religious groups, Roman Catholic and Lutheran, eliding other confessions.

At the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, which ended a period of armed conflict between Roman Catholic and Protestant forces within the Holy Roman Empire, the rulers of the German-speaking states and the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, agreed to accept this principle.

==Religious divisions in the Empire==
Prior to the 16th century and after the Great Schism, there had been one dominant faith in Western and Central European Christendom, and that was the Roman Catholic faith. Heretical sects that arose during that period, such as the Cathars and Waldenses, were either quickly extinguished or made irrelevant. Chief figures during the later period, prominently being John Hus and Martin Luther, at first called for the reform of the Catholic Church, but not necessarily a rejection of the faith &quot;per se&quot;. Later on, Luther&#x27;s movement broke away from the Catholic Church and formed the Lutheran denomination. Initially dismissed by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V as an inconsequential argument between monks, the idea of a religious reformation accentuated controversies and problems in many of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, which became engulfed in the ensuing controversy. The new Protestant theology galvanized social action in the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–1526), which was brutally repressed and the popular political and religious movement crushed. In 1531, fearful of a repetition of similar suppression against themselves, several Lutheran princes formed the Schmalkaldic League, an alliance through which they agreed to protect themselves and each other from territorial encroachment, and which functioned as a political alliance against Catholic princes and armies.

It was broadly understood by princes and Catholic clergy alike that growing institutional abuses within the Catholic Church hindered the practices of the faithful. In 1537, Pope Paul III had called a council to examine the abuses and to suggest and implement reforms. In addition, he instituted several internal reforms. Despite these efforts, and the cooperation of Charles V, rapprochement of the Protestants with Catholicism foundered on different concepts of ecclesiology and the principle of justification. In the same year, the Schmalkaldic League called its own council, and posited several precepts of faith; Luther was present, but too ill to attend the meetings. When the delegates met again, this time in Regensburg in 1540–41, representatives could agree on the doctrine of faith and justification, but not on the number of sacraments, especially whether or not confession/absolution was sacramental, and they differed widely on the definition of &quot;church&quot;. Catholic and Lutheran adherents seemed further apart than ever; in only a few towns and cities were Lutherans and Catholics able to live together in even a semblance of harmony. By 1548, political disagreements overlapped with religious issues, making any kind of agreement seem remote.

In 1548 Charles declared an &quot;interreligio imperialis&quot; (also known as the Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground. This effort succeeded in alienating Protestant and Catholic princes and the &quot;Curia&quot;; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the Catholic Council of Trent restated and reaffirmed Catholic teaching and condemned anew the Protestants. The Council played an important part in the reform of the Catholic Church in the 17th and 18th centuries.

==Augsburg Diet==

Catholic and Protestant ideology seemed further apart than ever. Charles&#x27; interim solution satisfied no one. He ordered a general Diet in Augsburg at which the various states would discuss the religious problem and its solution (this should not be confused with the Diet of Augsburg in 1530). He himself did not attend, and delegated authority to his brother, Ferdinand, to &quot;act and settle&quot; disputes of territory, religion and local power. At the conference, Ferdinand cajoled, persuaded and threatened the various representatives into agreement on three important principles: &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;, ecclesiastical reservation, and the Declaration of Ferdinand.

==&quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;==

The principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; provided for internal religious unity within a state: The religion of the prince became the religion of the state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince&#x27;s religion were allowed to leave, an innovative idea in the 16th century; this principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution. &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot; went against earlier Catholic teaching, which held that the kings should faithfully obey the pope. This obedience was thought to produce greater fruits of cooperation and less political infighting and fewer church divisions. The phrase &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; was coined in 1582 by the legist Joachim Stephani (1544–1623) of the University of Greifswald.

==Second and third principles of Augsburg Peace==

The second principle covered the special status of the ecclesiastical states, called the ecclesiastical reservation, or &quot;reservatum ecclesiasticum&quot;. If a prince-bishop or prince-abbot changed his religion, he would have to relinquish his rule, allowing the chapter to elect a Catholic successor.

The third principle, known as &quot;Ferdinand&#x27;s declaration&quot;, exempted knights and some of the cities in ecclesiastical states from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s, allowing for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.

==Legal ramifications==

After 1555, the Peace of Augsburg became the legitimating legal document governing the coexistence of Catholic and Lutheran faiths in the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire, and it served to ameliorate many of the tensions between followers of the so-called Old Faith and the followers of Luther. It had two fundamental flaws. First, Ferdinand had rushed the article on &quot;ecclesiastical reservation&quot; through the debate; it had not undergone the scrutiny and discussion that attended the acceptance of &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;. Consequently, its wording did not cover all, or even most, potential legal scenarios. His &quot;ad hoc&quot; &quot;Declaratio Ferdinandei&quot; was not debated in plenary session at all; instead, using his authority to &quot;act and settle&quot;, he had added it at the last minute, responding to lobbying by princely families and knights.
These specific failings came back to haunt the Empire in subsequent decades. Perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure to take into account the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the so-called evangelical and reformed traditions. By 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; or those of Huldrych Zwingli, were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Religious Peace, their religious beliefs were officially heretical, and would remain so in lands under the direct rule of the House of Habsburg until the Patent of Toleration in 1781.

==Application in secular territories==

The idea of individual religious tolerance on a national level was, however, not addressed: neither the Reformed nor Radical churches (Calvinists and Anabaptists being the prime examples) were protected under the peace (and Anabaptists would reject the principle of &quot;cuius regio eius religio&quot; in any case). Crypto-Calvinists were accommodated by Philip Melanchthon, who supplied them with altered versions of the Augsburg Confession adapted to Reformed beliefs. One historical example is the case of Hessen-Kassel, where even though the Augsburg Confession was adopted in 1566, the territory was &quot;de facto&quot; Reformed even then, and continued as such until officially adopting a Reformed confession of faith in 1605.

Many Protestant groups living under the rule of Catholic or Lutheran noble still found themselves in danger of the charge of heresy. Tolerance was not officially extended to Calvinists until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and most Anabaptists eventually relocated east to Transylvania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire, or Russia, west to England and the New World or were martyred.

After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 limited all rulers in the Holy Roman Empire except the Emperor to change their religion but not impose it on their subjects anymore, rulers choosing to convert had to tolerate the religions that were already in place. For example, Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland, but the Electorate of Saxony had to remain officially Protestant. The Elector of Saxony even managed to retain the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag.

John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg converted to Calvinism in 1613, but his subjects remained predominantly Lutheran. Brandenburg-Prussia remained a bi-confessional state in which both Lutheranism and Calvinism were official religions until the 1817 Prussian Union of Churches. The Electors of Brandenburg already tolerated Catholicism in Ducal Prussia, which lay outside the borders of the Holy Roman Empire and was held in fief to the King of Poland. They would later acquire other Catholic territories in Poland, but imposed taxes of up to 80% on church revenues. Brandenburg-Prussia also acquired territories in western Germany where Catholicism was the official religion. In 1747, Frederick the Great gave permission for a Catholic cathedral, St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral, to be built in the predominantly Lutheran capital city of Berlin.
===End of Cuius regio, eius religio===
==Application in ecclesiastical territories==

No agreement had been reached on the question of whether Catholic bishops and abbots who became Lutheran should lose their offices and incomes until Peace of Augsburg under the reservatum ecclesiasticum clause. However prior to this in 1525, Albert, Duke of Prussia had converted to Lutheranism and expelled the Teutonic Knights. He was able to officially change his lands to the Lutheran faith and convert his ecclesiastical position as Grand Master of the Order into a secular duchy. When Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg converted to the Reformed faith, he thought he could do the same, despite the terms of the &quot;Peace of Augsburg&quot;. Catholics appointed Ernest of Bavaria to be the new archbishop-elector and fought the five-year war Cologne War. Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg was exiled and Cologne remained Roman Catholic.

The Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück was an exception to &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;. Osnabrück gradually became more Lutheran after 1543, with the conversion or election of several Protestant bishops. However, it never became fully Lutheran, as Catholic services were still held and Catholic bishops were also elected. In the Peace of Westphalia, which was partially negotiated in Osnabrück, both the Catholic and Lutheran religions were restored to the status they held in Osnabrück in 1624. Osnabrück remained an ecclesiastical territory ruled by a prince-bishop, but the office would be held alternately by a Catholic bishop and a Lutheran bishop, who was selected from what became the House of Hanover. While the territory was ruled by a Lutheran bishop, the Catholics would be under the supervision of the Archbishop of Cologne.

In 1731, Prince-Archbishop von Firmian of Salzburg decided to his territory. At first this included the seizing of Protestant children from their parents so they could be raised in a Catholic institution. The Prince-Archbishop requested Imperial and Bavarian troops to aid in the suppression of approximately 20,000 Lutherans living in Salzburg. When the Archbishop claimed they were radicals, they were examined and determined to be Lutherans of the ordinary sort. He expelled them anyway, which was technically legal under the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.

In February 1732, King Frederick William I of Prussia offered to resettle them in eastern Prussia. Others found their way to Hanover or the Dutch Republic. Additionally, a community of Salzburgers settled in the British colony of Georgia.

In 1966, Archbishop expressed regret about the expulsions.

<text>Dith Pran (; 23 September 1942 – 30 March 2008) was a Cambodian American photojournalist. He was a refugee and survivor of the Cambodian genocide and the subject of the film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984).

==Early life==
Dith was born in Siem Reap, Cambodia, near Angkor Wat. His father worked as a public works official. He learned French at school and taught himself English.

The United States Army hired him as a translator but after his ties with the United States were severed, Dith worked with a British film crew for the film &quot;Lord Jim&quot; and then as a hotel receptionist.

==Cambodian genocide==
In 1975, Dith and &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Sydney Schanberg stayed behind in Cambodia to cover the fall of the capital Phnom Penh to the Communist Khmer Rouge. Schanberg and other foreign reporters were allowed to leave the country, but Dith was not. Due to the persecution of intellectuals during the genocide, he hid the fact that he was educated or that he knew Americans, and pretended that he had been a taxi driver. When Cambodians were forced to work in labour camps, Dith had to endure four years of starvation and torture before Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge on 7 January 1979. He coined the phrase &quot;killing fields&quot; to refer to the clusters of corpses and skeletal remains of victims he encountered during his escape. His three brothers and one sister were killed in Cambodia.

Dith travelled back to Siem Reap where he learned that 50 members of his family had died. The Vietnamese had made him village chief, but he feared they would discover his US ties, and he escaped to Thailand on 3 October 1979.

==Career in the United States==
After Schanberg learned that Dith had made it to Thailand, he flew halfway around the world, and they had a joyful reunion there. Schanberg brought Dith back to the United States to reunite him with his family, and in 1980 Dith joined his paper, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he worked as a photojournalist. He gained worldwide recognition after the 1984 release of the film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; about his experiences under the Khmer Rouge. He was portrayed in the film by first-time actor and fellow survivor Haing S. Ngor (1940–1996), who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. He campaigned for recognition of the Cambodian genocide victims, especially as founder and president of the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness Project. He was a recipient of an Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1998 and the Award of Excellence of the International Center.

==Personal life==
In 1986, he became a U.S. citizen with his then wife Ser Moeun Dith, whom he later divorced. He then married Kim DePaul but they also divorced.

==Death==
On 30 March 2008, Dith died, aged 65, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, having been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer three months earlier. He was living in Woodbridge, New Jersey.

<doc id="323937" wikidata="Q1551005" url="?curid=323937" title="Brent (name)">
<text>Brent is an Old English given name and surname. The place name can be from Celtic words meaning &quot;holy one&quot; (if it refers to the River Brent), or &quot;high place&quot;, literally, &quot;from a steep hill&quot; (if it refers to the villages in Somerset and Devon). The surname often indicates that one&#x27;s ancestors lived in a place called Brent.

Brent has also become a regularly used given name in some countries, being among the thousand most common names for boys born in the United States since 1933. When used as a given name today, Brent is sometimes a short form of Brenton, but this was probably not the original inspiration for Brent&#x27;s use as a given name, since Brenton&#x27;s own regular use as a first name came many years after Brent was established in that role.

<text>Sphaerodactylus is a genus of geckos from the Americas that are distinguished from other Gekkota by their small size, by their round, rather than vertical, eye pupils, and by each digit terminating in a single, round adhesive pad or scale, from which their name (&quot;Sphaero&quot; = round, &quot;dactylus&quot; = finger) is derived. All species in this genus are rather small, but two species, &quot;S. ariasae&quot; and &quot;S. parthenopion&quot;, are tiny, and – with a snout-vent length of about – the smallest reptiles in the world.

<doc id="323949" wikidata="Q5582818" url="?curid=323949" title="Good Neighbour Policy (horse racing)">
<text>The Good Neighbour Policy is an agreement among horse racing bodies that no signatory shall provide betting on horse racing to residents of another signatory&#x27;s jurisdiction without its permission, nor solicit, market nor advertise betting without prior authorisation from that other signatory.

The signatories to the agreement stated that its purpose was to show their unity in cracking down on illegal, unlicensed or unauthorised offshore bookmakers on horse racing, in order to protect the revenue of the signatories.

It is viewed by some as documenting an international cartel to defend the signatories from competition from commercial bookmakers and bet exchanges so as to maintain higher profits for themselves.

== History ==
The Policy was initially signed by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Japan Racing Association in 2002. On September 1, 2003, representatives from the Australian Racing Board, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Turf Authorities of India, the Japan Racing Association, the Korea Racing Association, New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing, the Singapore Turf Club and the Jockey Club of Turkey signed the multilateral agreement in Hong Kong on September 1, 2003. The Asian Racing Federation also endorsed the agreement.

<text>Thecadactylus is a gekko genus from the tropical Americas. They are known as the turnip-tailed geckos. The genus belongs to the gecko family Phyllodactylidae. Until 2007, it was believed to be monotypic, with &quot;T. rapicauda&quot; the sole species. Then however, the population from upstream southern Amazon basin was discovered to be very distinct and was named a new species, &quot;T. solimoensis&quot;. A third species was described in 2011.

<text>The Vickers Viscount is a British medium-range turboprop airliner first flown in 1948 by Vickers-Armstrongs. A design requirement from the Brabazon Committee, it entered service in 1953 and was the first turboprop-powered airliner.

The Viscount was well received by the public for its cabin conditions, which included pressurisation, reductions in vibration and noise, and panoramic windows. It became one of the most successful and profitable of the first postwar transport aircraft; 445 Viscounts were built for a range of international customers, including in North America.

==Development==

===Origins===


The Viscount was a response to the 1943 Brabazon Committee&#x27;s proposed Type II design for a postwar, small, medium-range, pressurised aircraft to fly less-travelled routes, carrying 24 passengers up to 1,750 mi (2,816 km) at 200 mph (320 km/h). During discussions between the committee and Vickers&#x27; chief designer, Rex Pierson, Vickers advocated turboprop power. The committee was not convinced and split the specification into two types, the Type IIA using piston power, which led to the Airspeed Ambassador, and the turboprop-powered Type IIB, which Vickers was selected to develop in April 1945. British European Airways (BEA) was involved in the design and asked that the aircraft carry 32 passengers, instead, but remained otherwise similar.

The first design in June 1945 was based on the Viking with four turboprop engines and 24 seats and designated the VC-2 or Type 453. Later, a double-bubble fuselage was proposed to give extra underfloor cargo space. Neither was pressurised, but the designers soon realised that for economical operation, an altitude above was needed. Thus, pressurisation was required. The decision for pressurisation resulted in the double-bubble and elliptical fuselage designs being abandoned. A circular cross-section variant was offered at the beginning of 1946. The resulting 28-seat VC-2 was financed by the Ministry of Supply with an order for two prototypes. Before the contract was signed, though, the government asked for the capacity to be increased to 32. This stretched the fuselage from to and meant an increased wingspan of .

The contract for the aircraft to Air Ministry specification C.16/46 was signed on 9 March 1946 and Vickers allocated the designation Type 609 and the name &quot;Viceroy&quot;. Although George Edwards had always favoured the 800 hp Rolls-Royce Dart other engines were considered, including the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba, which the government specified for the two prototypes. The choice of the Mamba engine increased the weight, but Vickers made sure the engine nacelle would fit either the Mamba or Dart. While the Dart progressed better in development, the government asked in August 1947 for the second prototype to be Dart-powered. The second prototype was designated the 630 and was named as the Viscount. The first prototype already under construction was converted to the Dart as a 630, as well.

The resulting Vickers Type 630 design was completed at Brooklands by chief designer Rex Pierson and his staff in 1945, a 32-seat airliner powered by four Dart engines for a cruising speed of 275 mph (443 km/h). An order for two prototypes was placed in March 1946, and construction started in the company&#x27;s Foxwarren Experimental Department. Originally named Viceroy after the viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the aircraft was renamed Viscount following India&#x27;s independence in 1947. Work took place on replacing the Darts with the Mamba, but this was dropped by the time the prototypes were reaching completion. After Pierson&#x27;s death in 1948, George Edwards (later Sir George Edwards) took over as chief designer and assumed all technical control over the Viscount project.

===Prototypes===

The prototype Type 630, registered &quot;G-AHRF&quot;, made its maiden flight from the grass airfield at Wisley on 16 July 1948, piloted by Joseph &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers, Vickers&#x27; chief test pilot. The design was considered too small and slow at 275 mph (443 km/h), making the per-passenger operating costs too high for regular service, and BEA had placed an order for 20 piston-engined Airspeed Ambassadors in 1947. Retrospectively commenting on Britain&#x27;s aviation industry, Duncan Burn stated: &quot;Had BEA committed itself to full support of the Viscount... it was quite likely that the smaller version would have gone into production... It was in a sense BEA&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the [Type] 630 which made possible the [Viscount&#x27;s] success.&quot;

Early flight trials, however, showed the qualities of a turboprop, resulting in a February 1949 order from the Ministry of Supply for a prototype of a stretched version with more powerful engines, the Type 700. Meanwhile, the first prototype Type 630 was awarded a restricted Certificate of Airworthiness on 15 September 1949, followed by a full certificate on 27 July 1950, which allowed the aircraft to be placed into trial service with BEA on 29 July to familiarise the pilots and ground crew with the new aircraft. It flew scheduled flights between London and Paris, and London and Edinburgh until 23 August 1950. The 29 July 1950 flight between Northolt and Paris – Le Bourget Airport with 14 paying passengers was the first scheduled airline flight by any turbine-powered aircraft.
The second prototype Viscount, the Type 663 testbed, had two Rolls-Royce Tay turbojet engines, and first flew in RAF markings as serial &quot;VX217&quot; at Wisley on 15 March 1950. It was demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September and was later used in the development of powered controls for the Valiant bomber. It later was used as a test bed by Boulton Paul Ltd for the development of electronic flight-control systems.

The designers then went back to the drawing board and the aircraft emerged as the larger Type 700 with up to 48 passengers (53 in some configurations), and a cruising speed of 308 mph (496 km/h). The new prototype &quot;G-AMAV&quot; first flew from Brooklands on 28 August 1950, and served as a development aircraft for the type for several years. In late August 1950, BEA placed an order for 20 aircraft; further orders came in the following year from operators such as Air France, Aer Lingus, and Misrair. In 1953, the basic cost given for a Viscount was £235,000.

===Performance and changes===
One reporter, after travelling on an Air France Viscount, wrote in 1953: &quot;Noise level was less than that of piston engines. It was a definite relief to be rid of the rough vibrations... The turboprop is an excellent shorthaul airplane and a definite crowd pleaser. The substitution of a lower constant-pitch noise and smoothness for the vibration, grunts, and groans of the piston engine gives the hesitant passenger a feeling of confidence.&quot; Viscount cabin windows were huge ellipses, 19 by 26 inches. Viscount operational costs were lower than many rival aircraft; Vickers projected a 700 could carry a 13,000-lb payload from Chicago to New York in 2 hours 45 minutes against a 10-mph headwind, burning 6395 lb of fuel.
All production Viscounts were powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop; from its initial 800 hp, and then 1,000 hp and higher, Rolls-Royce extensively developed the Dart engine, due to its popularity and use on the Viscount and several later aircraft. One key model was the Dart 506 engine, with better fuel efficiency than earlier models, allowing airline Viscounts to fly longer routes, with more payload. With the availability of more powerful engines, Vickers continued to develop the Viscount&#x27;s design. Later models could carry more passengers and had fewer load limitations.

Three basic versions of the Viscount were built. The first production version was the Type 700 powered by R.Da.3 Dart 505 and later R.Da.3 Dart 506s. A subvariant was the type 700Ds powered by R.D.a Dart 510s.

The second version was the Type 800, which was shorter in range and had a higher passenger capacity aircraft than the 700. The fuselage was lengthened and the rear pressure bulkhead was moved aft , allowing more passengers to be carried. The 800s (excepting the 806s) were powered by the Dart 510.

The third type of Viscount was the 810. It was the same size as the 800s, but was powered with R.Da. 7/1 Mk 225 or Mk 530 Darts. With the greater power, the 810 was faster and longer ranged than the 800.

Proposed type 740, 850, and 870 Viscounts never left the drawing board.

The Viscount&#x27;s good performance and popularity with customers encouraged Vickers to privately finance and develop an enlarged and re-engined variant of the Viscount, later designated as the Vickers Vanguard. The Vanguard drew extensively from the knowledge and design of the Viscount, and maintained its advantage of lower operating costs over jet airliners, but its disadvantage in being slower became critical as jets became more available.
==Operational history==
Regular passenger flights were launched by BEA on 18 April 1953, the world&#x27;s first scheduled turboprop airline service. BEA became a large user of the Viscount, as well the rival Handley Page Dart Herald; by mid-1958, BEA&#x27;s Viscount fleet had carried over 2.75 million passengers over 200,000 flight hours. Following BEA&#x27;s launch of the type, multiple independent charter operators, such as British Eagle, were quick to adopt the Viscount into their fleets. During the 1960s, the Viscount formed the backbone of domestic air travel in Scotland.
The early operational service of the Viscount quickly proved it to have significant performance advances over its rivals, and orders rapidly rose as a result; up to November 1952, only 42 aircraft had been ordered; by the end of 1953, the order book had risen to 90, and 160 by the end of the following year. Vickers was able to quickly respond to the new orders, as it had gambled on such orders emerging and early on the decision had been taken to commit to a high production rate at the company&#x27;s own risk. In 1957, the Vickers production line was producing the Viscount at a rate of one aircraft every three days.

In October 1953, the Viscount 700 prototype G-AMAV achieved the fastest time (40 hours 41 minutes flying time) in the transport section of the 12,367 mi (19,903 km) air race from London to Christchurch, New Zealand. The aircraft averaged 320 mph (520 km/h) in the event, crossing the finish line nine hours ahead of its closest rival, a Douglas DC-6A of KLM, with the latter winning on handicap. &quot;En route&quot;, equipped with extra fuel tanks, it flew 3,530 mi (5,680 km) nonstop from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to Melbourne&#x27;s Essendon Airport in 10 hours 16 minutes (343.8 mph).

Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) received its first Viscount in 1954, and the aircraft quickly proved profitable, leading to additional orders. The Viscount proved to be an invaluable aircraft for TAA, aviation author John Gunn stating, &quot;TAA had achieved dominance on Australia&#x27;s trunk routes with its turboprop Viscounts&quot;. TAA procured over a dozen Viscounts, and purchased later turboprop aircraft such as the Fokker F27 Friendship; It later transitioned to jet aircraft as passenger demand outgrew the capacity of the Viscounts. To compete with its rival TAA, another Australian airline, Ansett-ANA also procured its own small Viscount fleet; the Viscount allowed Ansett to set out a faster and superior service than the larger TAA for the first time. The Two Airlines Policy was formally established in 1952 by the Fifth Menzies Ministry. The policy took practical effect when Ansett purchased the failing Australian National Airways in 1957, resulting in it being the only competitor for the government-owned TAA. Unstated was the requirement for both airlines to have identical equipment.
The first North American airline to use turboprop aircraft was Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), with a small fleet of Type 700 Viscounts. Initially, TCA was cautious of the Viscount due to the turboprop engine being a new technology, and a preference had existed for acquiring the piston-engined Convair CV-240, instead; praise of the Viscount from pilots and a promise from Vickers to make any design changes desired by TCA persuaded it to procure the Viscount, instead. On 6 December 1954, the first Viscount was delivered to Canada in a large media event that included an improvised aerial display.

TCA became a prolific operator of the type, placing multiple follow-up orders for additional Viscounts. By 1958, TCA had an operational fleet of 51 Viscounts. Aviation author Peter Pigott later wrote: &quot;For TCA and Vickers, the Viscount was a public-relations coup. Passengers loved the quiet ride and panoramic windows. No other airline in North America flew turbo-prop airliners then, and no other British aircraft was bought by American airlines in such quantity.&quot; TCA operated the Viscount for two decades until Air Canada (TCA relabelled with a name equally at home in English and French), ended Viscount services in 1974. The type was replaced by the McDonnell Douglas DC-9.&quot;Routine Flight&quot; (1955) featured the TCA introduction of the Viscount in this National Film Board of Canada documentary.

TCA&#x27;s procurement of the Viscount generated considerable interest from airlines and industry figures across the United States, including American aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, who purchased 15 Viscounts immediately after personally flying one. US Capital Airlines became an important operator of the Type 700 Viscount, using it heavily throughout the eastern US routes; in 1958, Capital reportedly had accumulated over 350,000 flight hours on its Viscounts, more than any other operator. Continental Airlines and Northeast Airlines also became US Viscount operators.
The first airline in Latin America to operate the Viscount was Cubana de Aviación. Cubana&#x27;s −755D Viscounts, delivered in 1956, were placed on the Havana-Miami and Varadero-Miami routes, and were successful at raising Cubana&#x27;s market share on these routes. During the 1958 Cuban elections, a Cubana Viscount was hijacked by gunmen aligned with the 26th of July Movement; the aircraft crash-landed in the sea, reportedly killing 17 of the 20 occupants. When the US government imposed its embargo on Cuba in 1962, Cubana decided to sell all of its Viscounts. They were replaced by Soviet-built turboprop aircraft.

South African Airways (SAA) was another major operator of the Viscount; by January 1959, it was operating on all of SAA&#x27;s domestic routes. In 1961, SAA had seven Viscounts, and acquired a further aircraft from Cuba in the following year. In 1965, SAA began receiving Boeing 727s, which had been selected the previous year as a jet-powered replacement for the Viscount. SAA sold its last Viscount to British Midland in the 1970s.

Central African Airways (CAA) had been a traditional customer of Vickers, already operating a number of Vickers Vikings when it received its first Viscount on 25 April 1956. The introduction of the Viscount roughly coincided with the opening of a major airport at Salisbury, and the Viscount became the mainstay of the route between Johannesburg in South Africa, Salisbury (now renamed Harare) in modern-day Zimbabwe, and London, England. CAA had enough Viscounts to entirely replace its Viking fleet and to occasionally lease them to other operators. More Viscounts were purchased by CAA right up until 1965, when CAA announced its intention to procure the British Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s jet-powered BAC 1-11 successor as the long-term successor to the Viscount.
BEA, and its nationalised successor British Airways (BA), vigorously operated the Viscount on Britain&#x27;s domestic routes. In the 1980s, BA began withdrawing its ageing Viscount fleet; all BA Viscount operations in Scotland had ended in 1982. Former BA aircraft were often sold on to charter operators such as British Air Ferries. Some airlines chose to replace the Viscount with a newer turboprop aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley HS 748. On 18 April 1996, British World Airlines conducted the last Viscount passenger service in Britain, exactly 46 years after BEA&#x27;s inaugural flight; on board the flight were Sir George Edwards and Sir Peter Masefield.

In late 1960, the People&#x27;s Republic of China had begun negotiations with Vickers for as many as 40 Viscounts, but negotiations were protracted due to political tensions. At this point, China sought arrangements to purchase Viscounts second-hand from existing operators, and later achieved successive deals regarding the Viscount with Britain directly. The last batch of six aircraft built was for the Chinese CAAC Airlines, which was delivered during 1964; at the end of production. 445 Viscounts had been manufactured. Many Viscounts were refurbished and saw new service with African operators; sales of these second-hand aircraft continued into the 1990s.

The last airworthy Viscount, 9Q-COD, is believed to have been flown last in January 2009 for Global Airways in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<text>Subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow crops on smallholdings to meet the needs of themselves and their families. Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements. Planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year, and only secondarily toward market prices. Tony Waters, a professor of sociology, defines &quot;subsistence peasants&quot; as &quot;people who grow what they eat, build their own houses, and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace&quot;.

Despite the self-sufficiency in subsistence farming, most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree. Although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets, they use these markets mainly to obtain goods, not to generate income for food; these goods are typically not necessary for survival and may include sugar, iron roofing-sheets, bicycles, used clothing, and so forth. Many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace.

Subsistence farming today is most common in developing countries. Subsistence agriculture generally features: small capital/finance requirements, mixed cropping, limited use of agrochemicals (e.g. pesticides and fertilizer), unimproved varieties of crops and animals, little or no surplus yield for sale, use of crude/traditional tools (e.g. hoes, machetes, and cutlasses), mainly the production of crops, small scattered plots of land, reliance on unskilled labor (often family members), and (generally) low yields.

==History==
Subsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently, when market-based capitalism became widespread.

Subsistence agriculture largely disappeared in Europe by the beginning of the twentieth century. It began to decrease in North America with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the American South and Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s. In Central and Eastern Europe, semi-subsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy after 1990 but declined in significance (or disappeared) in most countries by the accession to the EU in 2004 or 2007.

==Contemporary practices==
Subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa, and parts of Asia and Latin America. In 2015, about 2 billion people (slightly more than 25% of the world&#x27;s population) in 500 million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as &quot;smallholder&quot; farmers, working less than 2 hectares (5 acres) of land. Around 98% of China&#x27;s farmers work on small farms, and China accounts for around half of the total world farms. In India, 80% of the total farmers are smallholder farmers; Ethiopia and Asia have almost 90% being small; while Mexico and Brazil recorded 50% and 20% being small.

Areas where subsistence farming is largely practiced today, such as India and other regions in Asia, have seen a recent decline in the practice. This is due to processes such as urbanization, the transformation of land into rural areas, and integration of capitalist forms of farming. In India, the increase in industrialization and decrease in rural agriculture has led to rural unemployment and increased poverty for those in lower caste groups. Those that are able to live and work in urbanized areas are able to increase their income while those that remain in rural areas take large decreases, which is why there was no large decline in poverty.  This effectively widens the income gap between lower and higher castes and makes it harder for those in rural areas to move up in caste ranking. This era has marked a time of increased farmer suicides and the &quot;vanishing village&quot;.

=== Adaptation to global warming ===
Most subsistence agriculture is practiced in developing countries located in tropical climates. Effects on crop production brought about by climate change will be more intense in these regions as extreme temperatures are linked to lower crop yields. Farmers have been forced to respond to increased temperatures through things such as increased land and labor inputs which threaten long-term productivity. Coping measures in response to variable climates can include reducing daily food consumption and selling livestock to compensate for the decreased productivity. These responses often threaten the future of household farms in the following seasons as many farmers will sell draft animals used for labor and will also consume seeds saved for planting. Measuring the full extent of future climate change impacts is difficult to determine as smallholder farms are complex systems with many different interactions. Different locations have different adaptation strategies available to them such as crop and livestock substitutions. Rates of production for cereal crops, such as wheat, oats, and maize have been declining largely due to heat&#x27;s effects on crop fertility. This has forced many farmers to switch to more heat tolerant crops to maintain levels of productivity. Substitution of crops for heat tolerant alternatives limits the overall diversity of crops grown on smallholder farms. As many farmers farm to meet daily food needs, this can negatively impact nutrition and diet among many families practicing subsistence agriculture.

Water availability has a crucial role in determining the productivity of subsistence agriculture, especially in dryland regions. Rain-needed farming, common in many areas, relies only on natural precipitation. Because of this, dryland farming is particularly susceptible to the ill effects of climate change in areas where weather patterns are already very erratic.doi:10.3390/atmos11121287

==Types of subsistence farming==
===Shifting agriculture===
In this type of farming, a patch of forest land is cleared by a combination of felling (chopping down) and burning, and crops are grown. After two–three years the fertility of the soil begins to decline, the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues. While the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area and soil fertility and biomass is restored. After a decade or more, the farmer may return to the first piece of land. This form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities, but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering, opens up more of the forest canopy, and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees, eventually resulting in deforestation and soil erosion. Shifting cultivation is called &quot;dredd&quot; in India, &quot;ladang&quot; in Indonesia and &quot;jhumming&quot; in North East India.

===Sedentary farming===
While shifting agriculture&#x27;s slash-and-burn technique may describe the method for opening new land, commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields, sometimes merely gardens, near the homestead there they practice intensive &quot;non-shifting&quot; techniques. These farmers pair this with &quot;slash and burn&quot; techniques to clear additional land and (by the burning) provide fertilizer (ash). Such gardens near the homestead often regularly receive household refuse. The manure of any household chickens or goats are initially thrown into compost piles just to get them out of the way. However, such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields. They also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water.

In some areas of tropical Africa, at least, such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds. Thus farmers practicing &quot;slash and burn&quot; agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term &quot;slash and burn&quot; subsistence farmers suggests.

===Nomadic herding===
In this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals. Generally they rear cattle, sheep, goats, camels and/or yaks for milk, skin, meat and wool. This way of life is common in parts of central and western Asia, India, east and southwest Africa and northern Eurasia. Examples are the nomadic Bhotiyas and Gujjars of the Himalayas. They carry their belongings, such as tents, etc., on the backs of donkeys, horses, and camels. In mountainous regions, like Tibet and the Andes, yak and llama are reared. Reindeer are the livestock in arctic and sub-arctic areas. Sheep, goats, and camels are common animals, and cattle and horses are also important.

===Intensive subsistence farming===
In intensive subsistence agriculture, the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour. Climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils, permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough for their local consumption, while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods. It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns. In the most intensive situation, farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies. Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia, such as in the Philippines. They may also intensify by using manure, artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer. Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, southwest, and southeast Asia.

== Poverty alleviation ==
Subsistence agriculture can be used as a poverty alleviation strategy, specifically as a safety net for food-price shocks and for food security. Poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs, which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle- and high-income countries. Low-income countries tend to have populations in which 80% of poor are in rural areas. More than 90% of rural households have access to land, yet most of these poor have insufficient access to food. Subsistence agriculture can be used in low-income countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries.

Agriculture is more successful than non-agricultural jobs in combating poverty in countries with a larger population of people without education or who are unskilled. However, there are levels of poverty to be aware of to target agriculture towards the right audience. Agriculture is better at reducing poverty in those that have an income of $1 per day than those that have an income of $2 per day in Africa. People who make less income are more likely to be poorly educated and have fewer opportunities; therefore, they work more labor-intensive jobs, such as agriculture. People who make $2 have more opportunities to work in less labor-intensive jobs in non-agricultural fields.

<text>Carphodactylus is a monotypic genus of geckos in the family Carphodactylidae. The genus consists of the sole species Carphodactylus laevis, commonly known as the chameleon gecko. The species is endemic to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is rated as Least Concern, as it is common (albeit secretive) within its range and occurs within protected areas. It currently experiences no major threats, though long-term climate change may alter or reduce its geographic distribution under some scenarios.

==Description==

C. laevis has an average snout-to-vent length (SVL) of . The head has large labial (lip) scales, relatively small postmental scales (behind the chin), and rounded rostral and mental shields (at the tip of the snout). The body and tail are slender and mediolaterally compressed (flattened from the side), with a thin vertebral ridge extending from the nape to the tapered tail. The limbs are long and thin, and the five-toed feet have thin and narrow digits with distinct claws and an angular profile from the side. The claws are surrounded by five enlarged scales at their base. The underside of each digit has a single row of small lamellae, each of which are slightly broadened sideways. The genus possesses preanal pores.

Coloration includes a broad black streak from the snout to the eye, and a pair of narrower streaks (black above and pale below) towards the tympanum. Dorsally, the head and body are brown, speckled with small paler brown spots and black specks concentrated around the vertebral line. The original tail is dark brown or black with four to five complete whitish vertical crossbands.

==Distribution and ecology==
&quot;C. laevis&quot; is found in cool rainforests of northeastern Queensland, at altitudes of . It is nocturnal, foraging on the leaf litter or low shrubs at night. &quot;C. laevis&quot; is oviparous. Mitochondrial DNA has been used to argue that different &quot;C. laevis&quot; populations experienced significant genetic isolation during dry periods in the Pleistocene, but that this did not result in significant phenotypic change between populations.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Carphodactylus&quot;, is Latin meaning &quot;twig finger&quot;. The specific name, &quot;laevis&quot;, is Latin meaning &quot;smooth&quot;.

<text>Crenadactylus ocellatus, also known as the southwestern clawless gecko or western clawless gecko, is the smallest species of nocturnal Gecko found in Australia.

Endemic to Australia, it is distributed in the southwest of the country, and found on stony ground or in &quot;Triodia&quot;-dominated deserts. It a ground-dwelling gecko; its habitat is leaf litter, rubbish piles, and beneath rocks. It is sometimes found in the lower parts of hummock grass.

It is sometimes called the western clawless gecko, but that name is also reserved for &quot;Crenadactylus occidentalis&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The first description of the species was published by John Edward Gray in 1845, in a revision of specimens at the British Museum, placing his type in the genus &quot;Diplodactylus&quot;. The specimen was preserved in alcohol and noted as collected by Buchanan in Western Australia. A description of two other specimens, obtained by John Gilbert and noted as collected at &quot;Houtman&#x27;s Abrollos&quot;, was assigned to another species, &quot;Diplodactylus bilineatus&quot;, later recognised as the same taxon.

The diversity within the genus &quot;Crenadactylus&quot; has been circumscribed as a subspecific arrangement, two or three geographically identified subspecies, until a revision in 2016 elevated part of the population to a separate species.

The vernacular Gray gave for his two species names were &#x27;the two-lined diplodactyle&#x27;, for the epithet &quot;bilineatus&quot;, and &#x27;the eyed diplodactyle&#x27; to &quot;ocellatus&quot;.

<doc id="323972" wikidata="Q137420" url="?curid=323972" title="Eurydactylodes">
<text>Eurydactylodes is a small genus of geckos commonly referred to as chameleon geckos from the subfamily Diplodactylidae, endemic to New Caledonia and few adjacent islands. Within the Diplodactylidae, &quot;Eurydactylodes&quot; resides in the Carphodactylini tribe, and consists of four species. All species share similar morphology as well as lifestyle and habits. The first of the &quot;Eurydactylodes&quot; species to be classified, &quot;E. vieillardi&quot;, was discovered in 1869.

==Species==
Eurydactylodes comprises four species:
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Eurydactylodes&quot;.

== Appearance and anatomy ==

=== Body ===
Eurydactylodes geckos are approximately 55mm in length with a laterally compressed and narrow body shape, whom are covered in enlarged scales which are smooth and flattened along the dorsal body. These geckos are pale green in colouration yet lack peritoneal pigmentation. They also feature high, prominent spines as well as an increased amount of inscriptional ribs which are infrequent amongst other gekkota. On the back of the hindlimb there are loose folds of skin. Species of Eurydactylodes are closely related in appearance to the Rhacodactylus genus.

=== Head ===
Their head has large and flattened anterior headshields as well as an indentation of unscaled skin between the jaw and ear opening which may be complete or partial – and is the primary diagnostic character used to distinguish Eurydactylodes species. Enlarged endolymphatic sacs are located extracranially, and the tongue and mouth lining is yellow or orange. Premaxilla are completely paired, and the maxilla is in close contact with the frontal. The jugal bone is large and in contact with the gecko&#x27;s infraorbital processes while ornamentation upon the dorsal surface of the skull is present. Eurydactylodes have 27 scleral ossicles present in one eyeball and nasal process which is wide, short and large. These geckos also have approximately 30 premaxillary and 30 dental teeth which are conical and blunt. Such teeth are also homodont and pleurodont and increase in size anteriorly.

=== Tail ===
Eurydactylodes geckos have a long and slender tail – being approximately the same length as their body and possessing a snout-vent length of 100% - and are round in cross section. The tail is muscular and prehensile, aided by a subcaudal scansorial pad and adhesive subcaudal tissue with soft, long hairs. Covered in numerous small scales, the tail also has pores which are located near the anal opening and are concentrated in a large singular patch. A caudal glandular ability enables the serial openings in the tail to squirt a defensive secretion. Regenerated tails appear similar to the gecko&#x27;s previous tail.

=== Digits ===
The digits of the species within the Eurydactylodes genus are short and slender as well as dilated and strongly depressed. Distal phalangeal elements are neither compressed nor raised and follow gekkonid formula of 2-3-4-5-3 in hands and 2-3-4-5-4 in feet. All digits possess claws which are high at the base, compressed, robust and decurved and feature large, singular expanded pads underneath. Webbing between digits is lacking or absent completely.

==Behaviour and diet==
Eurydactylodes geckos are actively mobile yet slow moving and able to live for over a decade. These geckos are arboreal and spend little time on the ground. These geckos display diurnality, and choose to perch on the stalks and leaves of plants even in periods of inactivity as opposed to seeking cover. When threatened or approached, Eurydactylodes geckos may flatten their bodies against substrate, flee, hiss, growl or croak without a physical display or bite without warning. All Eurydactylodes species possess a defensive mechanism present in their tail which enables them to squirt a sticky liquid when stressed. In accordance with gekkonidae, the genus display ability of crypsis, possess an ability to lick their eyeballs in order to keep them clean and are insectivores yet also eat worms, fruit, and flower nectar.

==Habitat==
This genus of geckos inhabits a variety of woodland environments including Maquis shrublands, sclerophyll forest, gallery forest and montane forest. Such forests are humid with a tropical/subtropical climate, with both high and low rainfall, and offer opportunity for the arboreal geckos to perch on plants including trees, shrubs, vines, sedges, grasses and ferns. All geckos within the genus have been recorded at 20 metres above sea level, and have an upper elevation limit of approximately 1000 metres above sea level except for E. occidentalis with an upper limit of 20 metres.

==Reproduction==
Eurydactylodes geckos are oviparous, and only breed once a year. They lay a hard and mostly impermeable shelled egg which is composed of calcium carbonate. These eggs are among the largest relative to female body size of any gecko. Such eggs are initially pliable yet harden on exposure to air, and are more elongated and elliptical in shape in comparison to other gekkonine subfamilies. Enlarged endolymphatic sacs along each side of the neck are postulated to act as reservoirs storing calcareous material aiding in egg shell formation – being larger in females and increasing in size and density prior to egg-laying. However, endolymphatic sacs may also be required for assistance with periods of rapid bone growth.
== Distribution ==
Species within the Eurydactylodes genus are endemic to New Caledonia along with few adjacent islands theorised to be due to Diplodactylinae dispersion from Southeast Asia through the Indo-Australian islands. E. symmetricus is located in the southern part of Grande Terre with a northernmost location of Pic Ningua. E. symmetricus is allopatric with E. occidentalis yet sympatric with E. vieillardi. E. occidentalis is present in Province Sud and distributed in the central west coast of Grande Terre between Poya and Bourail. E. agricolae is parapatric with E. vieillardi and dispersed amongst Province Nord within Northern Grande Terre and also on the Iles Belep and Ile Yandé. E. vieillardi is widespread on Grande Terre south of the Koniambo and Tchingou massifs and also located from Ile des Pins.

== Evolution ==
The Diplodactylidae family with which Eurydactylodes resides is postulated to have evolved from a primitive gekkonid radiation located in south-east Asian tropics within the upper Cretaceous. Dispersion of this ancestral stock occurred toward Australia through the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Within this family, the Carphodactylini tribe containing Eurydactylodes are characterised as more primitive due to presence of numerous preanal pores concentrated into a large patch as well as a large nasal process and arboreal lifestyle. The extensive differences between the opposing Diplodactylini tribe indicate Carphodactylini differentiation occurring as early as Palaeocene-Eocene time. Genera present within the New Caledonia-Loyalty Islands radiation as a result of evolutionary migration include Eurydactylodes, Rhacodactylus, and likely Bavayia. Eurydactylodes are convergent with Australian diplodactylid genus Strophurus, twig anoles and other gekkonids according to traits involving crypsis, defense, and reproduction.

== History ==
French herpetologist Arthur René Jean Baptiste Bavay described the species E. vieillardi under the name of Platydactylus vieillardi in his first catalogue of reptiles in New Caledonia titled &quot;Catalogue des reptiles de la Nouvelle-Caledonia et description dupuces nouvelle&quot; during 1869. The genus Eurydactylus was named by Henri Émile Sauvage to accommodate the new specimen described by Bavay. Swedish herpetologist Lars Gabriel Andersson described a second species associated with the Eurydactylus genus named E. symmetricus in the article &quot;Two new Lizards (Eurydactylus and Lygosoma) from New Caledonia&quot; according to a single specimen and without specific locality data. The systematic placement of the genus was previously unknown until the efforts of Garth Leon Underwood who allocated the genus into the Gekkoninae according available literature in 1954. Underwood then proceeded to transfer the genus to the Diplodactylinae as justified by several characteristics in 1955 which has since been accepted by all following authors. In 1965, Heinz Fritz Wermuth altered the genus name to Eurydactylodes upon discovering that Andersson&#x27;s name was a homonym for Eurydactylus LaFerté-Sénectère – an insect and member of Carabidae. Recently, German herpetologist Wolfgang Böhme and Friedrich Wilhelm Henkel described a third species E. agricolae in 2001 and suggested that further species may be discovered under the genus. D. Han reevaluated the higher order relationships of gekkotans and hence reallocated Eurydactylodes to the Family Diplodactylidae in 2004. An additional species E. occidentalis was also described by American herpetologists Aaron Matthew Bauer and Todd R Jackman as well as Ross Allen Sadlier and Anthony Hume Whitaker in 2009.

== Threats ==
Eurydactylodes species range from CR (critically endangered) to NT (Near threatened) referring to the IUCN red list of threatened species. The following threats are common causations for the decreasing population trend of all species within the Eurydactylodes genus:

=== Habitat loss and deforestation ===
Eurydactylodes habitat loss is worsened through urban development and natural disasters. Expansion of massif nickel mining in Poum, Dôme de Tiébaghi, Kaala and Taom are resulting in the destruction of Maquis vegetation. Livestock and wild ungulates such as deer and pigs as well as cattle at Rivière Nehoué are resultant in agricultural deforestation. Wood and pulp plantations and also non-timber crops require cleared land to be farmed. Wildfires occur throughout the dry forest environment along the western coast of New Caledonia and in adjacent islands. Southern New Caledonia is subject to the threat of indigenous forestation being transformed into exotic forestry. Tourism development at Gouara-Déva requires land for development causing further habitat loss.
=== Invasive species ===
Predation by introduced species along the sclerophyll remnants of the western coast of New Caledonia including rodents and feral cats are harmful to Eurydactylodes geckos. Lower- elevation forests are abundant in the invasive ant Wasmannia auropumctata which are speculated to have a damaging effect on Eurydactylodes populations.

=== Pet trade ===
The resemblance of Eurydactylodes geckos to chameleons as well as its diurnal activity makes them a suitable pet for many. Thus, these geckos have been in the international pet trade since at least 2017 as well as a potential target for illegal collection and trafficking. Eurydactylodes specimens have appeared on the market in Europe for 1000 Euro in 2019, and prices have reached up to US$2300 for pairs.

== Conservation ==
All species under the Eurydactylodes genus are protected in Province Nord under Code de l&#x27;environnement de la Province Nord (Délibération No. 306-2008/APN, 24 October 2008) as well as in Province Sud under Code de l&#x27;environnement de la Province Sud (Délibération No. 25-2009/APS, 20 March 2009). The geckos are present in many reserves throughout southern New Caledonia, including Pic Ningua, Pic du Grand Kaori and Forêt Nord as well as Parc Provincial de la Rivière Bleue. No other conservation effort is enacted to preserve Eurydactylodes geckos in New Caledonia. It has been suggested that management of protected areas be undertaken urgently including surveys monitoring Eurydactylodes population size and trends, habitat loss and invasive fire ants.

<text>Institut Curie is a medical, biological and biophysical research centre in France. It is a private non-profit foundation operating a research center on biophysics, cell biology and oncology and a hospital specialized in treatment of cancer. It is located in Paris, France.

Institut Curie is member of EU-LIFE, an alliance of leading life sciences research centres in Europe.

==Research==
The institute now operates several research units in cooperation with national research institutions CNRS and INSERM. There are several hundred research staff at the institute. &quot;Institut Curie&quot; does not offer undergraduate degrees, but awards PhDs and employs many postdoctoral students alongside its permanent staff. Institut Curie is a constituent college (associate member) of University PSL.

==Hospital==
&quot;Institut Curie&quot; runs the &quot;Hôpital Claudius Régaud&quot;, a hospital specializing in cancer. The institute also operates the proton therapy center at Orsay, one of the few such facilities in the world.

==History==

The Institut du Radium, a giant laboratory for Marie Skłodowska–Curie, was founded in 1909 by the University of Paris and Institut Pasteur. The Institut du Radium had two sections. The Curie laboratory, directed by Maria Skłodowska-Curie, was dedicated to physics and chemistry research. The Pasteur laboratory, directed by Claudius Regaud, was studying the biological and medical effects of radioactivity. After receiving a joint Nobel Prize with her husband Pierre in 1903, Maria Skłodowska-Curie won a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. During World War One, Skłodowska-Curie used it to teach nurses about radiology.

Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Claudius Regaud established the Foundation Curie in 1920, a public interest institution. The Foundation&#x27;s purpose was to fund the Institut du Radium&#x27;s activities and contribute to the development of its therapeutic component. A first hospital opened in 1922. At the clinic, Regaud and his team developed innovative treatments combining surgery and radiation therapy to treat cancer. The Curie Foundation became a model for cancer centers around the world. Curie laboratory continued to play an important role in physics and chemistry research. In 1934, Skłodowska-Curie&#x27;s daughter Irène and her son-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie discovered artificial radioactivity. In 1935, it was recognized with a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Institut du Radium and the Fondation Curie merged in 1970. It became Institut Curie. The Institut has three missions: research, teaching and treating cancer. The original building of Curies Laboratory from 1914 now houses the Musée Curie.

==Nobel Laureates and female scientists mentorship==
Six Nobel prizes laureates (and four Nobel prizes) are attached to the Institute&#x27;s researchers.

*Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Physics, 1903 - thus becoming the first ever woman awarded the Nobel Prize
*Maria Skłodowska-Curie. Chemistry, 1911 - thus becoming the only person in the world, women or men, awarded two Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Peace prize excluded), originally the first person and, to this day, the first and only woman with two Nobel Prizes cf. Statistics on the Nobel Prize
*Pierre Curie, Physics, 1903 - thus becoming the first married couple to receive the Nobel Prize
*Irène Joliot-Curie, Chemistry, 1935 - thus becoming the only mother-daughter and sole father-daughter pairs in the world to have received a Nobel Prize to this day
*Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chemistry, 1935 - thus making of the Curie Institute the only research center in the world with two wife-and-husband researching couples awarded with the Nobel Prize
*Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Physics, 1991

43% of all scientific women Nobel prize laureates from France (three prizes out of seven received by French women in &quot;hard&quot; sciences and Economy) to this day received them for research conducted at Institut Curie or its ancestor the Radium Institute. If Economy - a social science - is excluded, 50% i.e 3 Nobel Prizes out of 6 received by French scientific women are affiliated to the Curie Institute.

Hence why it is considered that, based on internationally recognised prizes garnered by its researchers, no other research center in the world has hosted that many pioneering women scientists.

Moreover, Curie mentored upwards of 45 scientific women from all over the world including Marguerite Perey, discoverer of francium - five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Jeanne Ferrier, discoverer of autoradiography, amongst many other peers: Sonia Cotelle, Harriet Brooks, Alice Leigh-Smith, Eva Ramstedt, Lucie Blanquies, Suzanne Veil, Catherine Chamié, Alicja Dorabialska, Ellen Gleditsch, Marthe Weiss, Antonia Elisabeth Korvezee, May Sybil Leslie, Ștefania Mărăcineanu, Branca Edmée Marques, Eliane Montel, Elizabeth Rona, Jadwiga Szmidt, Margarete von Wrangell, Renée Galabert, Isabelle Archinard, and last but not least, Curie&#x27;s secretary of over 30 years: Léonie Razet.

The Radium Institute also pioneered mobile radiography during World War I where upwards of 150 proto-nurses (nursing diploma in France only in 1922) and radiology pioneers where trained and even more post-war.

<text>Hoplodactylus is a genus of geckos in the family Diplodactylidae. The genus is endemic to New Zealand, one of the seven genera of geckos found only in New Zealand. &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot; comprises two species of large to gigantic brownish lizards.

== Description ==
Species in this genus (now split into several genera) tend to have rather dull colouration with little variation on a generally brown/grey theme, although mottled greens are seen in some species, notably the forest gecko (&quot;Mokopirirakau granulatus&quot;). The one exception to this rule of general drabness in colouration is the striking &quot;herring boned&quot; colour pattern of green, brown, black and white that is displayed by the &quot;Harlequin Gecko&quot; (&quot;Tukutuku rakiurae&quot;).

Although generally species of this genus cannot compete with those of &quot;Naultinus&quot; in terms of their vivid and beautiful colouration, &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot; species do have the ability to subtly change their skin colour pattern to give better camouflage, thus reducing the risk of predation. &quot;In some of the Hoplodactylus species, the ability to change colour provides a supplementary method of thermoregulation&quot;(*1). When basking in cold conditions they can darken their skin to increase the amount of heat absorbed and conversely they can lighten the shades in hot weather to reflect more light and keep cool. All species in this genus have more or less nocturnal activity patterns in contrast to the solely diurnal nature of &quot;Naultinus&quot; species and unlike species in the latter genus, are not purely arboreal and will forage on the ground.

&quot;Hoplodactylus&quot; species do not have &quot;prehensile&quot; tails and are thus generally less reluctant to drop them when disturbed by predators than species in the genus &quot;Naultinus&quot;.

Many species of the genus &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot; also have toes that are broader and more expanded than do their relatives in the genus &quot;Naultinus&quot;.

The key differences between New Zealand&#x27;s two endemic gecko genera are summarised in the table below

*references used for this table;

== Species ==

&quot;Hoplodactylus duvaucelii&quot; is the largest species of gecko remaining in New Zealand, although due to predation by introduced mammals such as the brown rat their confirmed range is at present largely restricted to pest-free offshore islands. However, in 2010 a Duvaucel&#x27;s gecko was caught in a trap near Maungatautari, indicating that there are remnant populations on the New Zealand mainland. In 2023, the population of Hoplodactylus from islands in Cook Strait was determined to be a distinct species, &quot;Hoplodactylus tohu&quot;, which is believed to have formerly had a range across the South Island.

The extinct &quot;Hoplodactylus delcourti&quot; is the largest known gecko in the world. It was first described in 1986, though the only known specimen was collected in the early 19th century but was overlooked in a French museum for more than a century. However, it was later shown by genetic evidence to be nested within New Caledonian geckos, warranting its placement in the separate genus &quot;Gigarcanum,&quot; meaning that it is unlikely that the specimen originated in New Zealand, and thus was probably not the kawekaweau of Maori legend.

<text>The beaded gecko (Lucasium damaeum) is a gecko endemic to Australia.

==Description==

With only a few species of the genus &quot;Lucasium&quot; it is endemic to Australia. The 7 cm long beaded gecko is reddish brown on top, with what looks like chains of beads surrounding the cream pale ridged vertebral strip, thus given the name of beaded gecko. Single lines of pale blotches run down the side of its body with scattered smaller spots covering its dark brown limbs and surrounding body. This gecko has a rounded snout rather than beaked (with the rostral connection to the nostril), reddish brown in colour with a white or cream upper eyelid that is not able to cover, protect or clean the eye, rather the eye is covered in protective transparent scales. To keep the eye clean they use their long flat tongue to wipe the eye. With relatively large eyes, the pupil is a thin vertical slit during the day and rounded and full in the dark. The tail is a straight continuum of the body and the original tail has continuing patterns from the body down but will reproduce plain brown or spotted darker tails. The toes of a beaded gecko are flat and unkinked without adhesive pads and usually whitish in colour. The feet of the beaded gecko are not suitable for climbing 
The beaded gecko is nocturnal. Hiding through the day and coming out at night they travel large distances in search of food.

==Distribution==
Beaded geckos are found in drier arid to semi-arid climate parts of mainland Australia in all states and the Northern Territory.

==Ecology and habitat==
The beaded gecko is a terrestrial (ground-dwelling) animal that can be found in a variety of dry desert habitats within mainland Australia from the savannah woodlands to spinifex-covered sandhills. During the day the gecko uses insects and spider holes for shelter before coming out at night to hunt in open areas. This swift-moving gecko covers large areas in search for food.

==Reproduction==
The beaded gecko is oviparous, meaning it lays eggs rather than giving birth. Females are known to lay 2 eggs per clutch. Like most Australian reptiles, geckos have a breeding season which is from late September to December. Males have paired sex organs, each independent.

==Diet==
Beaded geckos like most other small lizards feed mainly on insects. The jaw is surrounded with short fine teeth; however, prey is crushed by the gecko rather than chewed.

==Threats==
Threats include loss of habitat, and feral predators like dogs, cats and foxes.

<text>Naultinus is a genus of geckos that are endemic to New Zealand. On account of their striking colouration, species in the genus &quot;Naultinus&quot; are commonly known as green geckos. There are nine described species in the genus. Species in the genus share a number of traits that set them apart as quite different from the rest of the world&#x27;s two thousand odd gecko species, which are generally brown in colour, ovivaparous, short-lived and nocturnal. In contrast, &quot;Naultinus&quot; are green (with the exceptions of males in two South Island species which exhibit sexual dimorphism in colouration), ovovivaparous, live up to 30 years or more and are strictly diurnal. New Zealand has a temperate, maritime climate, and in terms of distribution &quot;Naultinus&quot; is one of the southernmost gecko genera in the world — some species live in habitats in the South Island which receive regular snowfall in winter. Animals in this genus possess several physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with these periods of low temperatures and adverse weather.

While historically widespread and quite common in areas of native forest all over the country, all species in this genus are of conservation concern in the present day. All nine species of &quot;Naultinus&quot; are declining in the wild and are much harder to find than they used to be; the populations of the various species are highly fragmented and approaching extinction, while others in the genus have already gone extinct. Entire populations of certain species, with unique traits and distinctive genetic profiles, have disappeared in the last 20 years. The primary known agents of this catastrophic decline include predation by invasive mammalian and avian species, habitat destruction and poaching for the illegal pet trade. Vespid wasp predation is speculated to be another possible contributing cause. Legal protection in the form of longer prison sentences for poachers caught with New Zealand protected species has been increased in recent years and translocations of various species to pest free islands have been undertaken with mixed results, but the task of saving these animals remains daunting. The behavioural and visually cryptic nature of these animals also pose challenges to their conservation management. The genus is, in general, in &quot;dire need of research, particularly into factors that are causing their apparent decline&quot;, certain aspects of which remain unexplained.

==Taxonomy==
The following nine described species are recognized as being valid. A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Naultinus&quot;.
*&quot;Naultinus elegans&quot; – Auckland green gecko
*&quot;Naultinus flavirictus&quot; – Aupouri green gecko, North Cape green gecko, yellow-lipped green gecko
*&quot;Naultinus gemmeus&quot; – jewelled gecko
*&quot;Naultinus grayii&quot; – Northland green gecko, Gray&#x27;s tree gecko
*&quot;Naultinus manukanus&quot; – Marlborough green gecko, northern tree gecko
*&quot;Naultinus punctatus&quot; – Wellington green gecko
*&quot;Naultinus rudis&quot; – rough gecko, natural tree gecko
*&quot;Naultinus stellatus&quot; – Nelson green gecko, starry tree gecko
*&quot;Naultinus tuberculatus&quot; – West Coast green gecko, Lewis Pass green gecko

Defining what constitutes a species among different populations within this genus has proved difficult and is still a matter of some scientific debate. Genetic evidence suggests that all nine species share an ancestor which is &quot;very recent&quot; in deep time terms and that hybridization between them is quite common. All species will interbreed in the wild, which has led some biologists to reject the notion of multiple &quot;Naultinus&quot; species and to instead view each &quot;species&quot; as a separate &quot;race&quot; or subspecies of a single, very widespread species of this genus. However, there are many clear differences between recognized species in colouration, breeding times and even scale morphology. Many neighbouring species have slightly different mating seasons and behaviour, which is thought to explain why the species maintain their differences despite &quot;strong reproductive compatibility&quot;. These differences are the basis for the present consensus in the scientific community that &quot;Nautilnus&quot; is constituted of nine species instead of nine races of a single species.

Genetically speaking, the jewelled gecko (&quot;N. gemmeus&quot;) of the southern South Island is the most genetically distinct of the recognized species. In fact, it is thought that this species is the one that is ancestral to all other species in the genus. There are three distinct populations of &quot;N. gemmeus&quot; in Southland, Otago and Canterbury, differentiated by coloration and the time of their breeding seasons. In addition to recognizing &quot;gemmeus&quot; as one of a number of separate species within the genus, some biologists think that the three different populations of this species should be elevated to subspecies status to place more emphasis on their conservation management.

==Description==
&quot;Naultinus&quot; species are commonly known as &quot;green geckos&quot; in New Zealand for their striking bright green colouration. In addition, they are diurnal, which allows them to take advantage of warmer day-time temperatures. Both of these features are shared only with the day geckos (&quot;Phelsuma&quot;) of Madagascar. Almost every other type of gecko in the world is nocturnal and brown or grey in colour. All &quot;Naultinus&quot; are arboreal, and though most of them are predominantly green, their skin patterns are known to be plain (&quot;N. manukanus&quot;, &quot; N. punctatus&quot;), spotted (&quot;N. elegans&quot;, &quot;N. flavirictus&quot;, &quot;N. gemmeus&quot;, &quot;N. grayii&quot;, &quot;N. punctatus&quot;, &quot;N. rudis&quot;, &quot;N. stellatus&quot;, &quot;N. tuberculatus&quot;), or striped (&quot;N. gemmeus&quot;). Occasionally, individuals of an overall lemon-yellow colour are encountered; this is a rare genetic colour morph similar to albinism.
The distinctive green colouration is almost universally predominant; with the two exceptions of male &quot;N. rudis&quot; as well as males of some populations of the Canterbury form of &quot;N. gemmeus&quot;, which are sexually dichromatic. While females are green, the males of &quot;N. rudis&quot; are grey with white and brown splotches, and in Canterbury, &quot;N. gemmeus&quot; females are always predominantly green as compared to the grey, brown or white males. The inside of the mouth, which is revealed in a threat display in some species, is deep blue, orange, pink or red. The broad fleshy tongue, which has a major function in cleaning the transparent scales which cover the eyes, is also brightly coloured; depending on the species it is red, orange, pink, yellow or black. The ears of New Zealand geckos appear as small openings on the side of the head behind the eyes, and the eardrum is visible a short distance inside this opening.

&quot;Naultinus&quot; species and indeed, New Zealand lizards in general, are very conservative in their evolutionary development of scales. Most have the standard gecko-type scales which are small and granular, giving the skin a dull, velvety appearance. The two exceptions to this rule are two South Island members of the genus; the rough gecko (&quot;N. rudis&quot;) and, to a lesser extent, the Marlborough green gecko (&quot;N. manukanus&quot;). The rough gecko has enlarged conical scales which are both significantly wider and which protrude much further from the body than ordinary scales. These enlarged scales are scattered all over the body except for the underside of the animal. The Marlborough green gecko also has enlarged scales, but they are confined to the dorsal, pelvic area, and sometimes even in rows along the side of the animal. In any case, they are never found over all upper surfaces of the body as in the rough gecko.

All &quot;Naultinus&quot; species also possess very long, finely tapered, strongly prehensile tails which they use as a &quot;fifth limb&quot; for grasping when they climb among the twigs and leaves of their arboreal habitat. They can hang by their tails if necessary. They also have comparatively slender toes, another adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle. The arboreal &quot;Naultinus&quot; use their toes in a grasping action on twigs and leaves, but there is some lamellar function as well.

===Summary table of the key differences between &quot;Naultinus&quot; and &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot;===
There are many key differences in physiology and behaviour between species of NZ gecko in the two endemic genera, summarised in the table below:

==Distribution and habitat==
The nine described species of &quot;Naultinus&quot; are found throughout the North and South islands of New Zealand and on a number of offshore islands. Historically, &quot;Naultinus&quot; species lived throughout the length of New Zealand, from the coast to as much as 1400 metres above sea level. However, all species have now undergone massive declines, and populations nationwide are fragmented and few &quot;(see &quot;Conservation&quot;)&quot; Four species; &quot;elegans&quot;, &quot;grayii&quot;, &quot;flavirictus&quot; and &quot;punctatus&quot; are found only in the North Island. What was previously thought to be a distinct population of &quot;grayii&quot;, found only in the far north on the Aupōuri Peninsula has been determined from genetic work in the early 2000s to be a new species, more closely related, in fact, to &quot;elegans&quot;. It was described as &quot;N. flavirictus&quot; in 2021. The remaining five species: &quot;gemmeus&quot;, &quot;manukanus&quot;, &quot;rudis&quot;, &quot;stellatus&quot;, and &quot;tuberculatus&quot; are found only in the South Island. South Island &quot;Naultinus&quot; were, in the past, placed in a separate genus called &quot;Heteropholis&quot; but this taxon was abandoned when new genetic research in the 1980s showed little phylogenetic basis for this taxonomic division.

None of the &quot;Naultinus&quot; gecko populations are sympatric, presumably because each species is very finely adapted to its local environment and also because their respective ecological niches are incredibly similar.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Activity patterns and diet===
Most of the world&#x27;s two thousand-odd species of geckos are active by night (nocturnal) whereas all species of &quot;Naultinus&quot; are active by day (diurnal). Unlike their close relatives in the genus &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot;, &quot;Naultinus&quot; species lack the ability to alter their skin color. These geckos are omnivores. Diet for members of this genus consists of flying insects such as moths and flies but also of flightless invertebrates such as amphipods and spiders. All New Zealand geckos will supplement their primarily insectivorous diet and consume nectar and berries (the small purple fruits of Māhoe for example) and there is evidence that, in doing so, they may have a function in New Zealand ecosystems as pollinators and seed dispersers for certain species of native plant. In captivity they will thrive on a simple diet of moths and flies caught in traps.

===Predators and parasites===
New Zealand geckos have very few &quot;natural&quot; predators; although several species of native bird will take them as prey only the sacred kingfisher kills very many. The Tuatara, a large, ground dwelling, generalist predator, will feed on native geckos, including &quot;Naultinus&quot;, where the two occur together on a few predator-free offshore islands. All New Zealand geckos, including &quot;Naultinus&quot; (but particularly &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot; species) carry small orange-red skin mites which gather around the eyes, the base of limbs, ear openings and skin folds. These mites, while essentially harmless, do suck small amounts of blood from their hosts, in time becoming quite swollen and taking on their characteristically vivid colouration as a result.

===Thermoregulation===
As ectotherms, &quot;Naultinus&quot; geckos will move to positions of higher or lower temperature in order to thermoregulate. Because &quot;Naultinus&quot; spend most of their time on the top of plant foliage, they gain much of their heat directly from the sun. Thus, control of the upper limits of temperature is achieved by moving from the outside of the foliage in areas of direct sunlight, to shaded areas beneath the outside of the vegetation. Control of the lower limits of temperature involves more movement for the animals. Because New Zealand has a temperate climate, &quot;Naultinus&quot; geckos live in areas which are at times (particularly in winter) exposed to very cold temperatures and high levels of rainfall. In such adverse weather animals will descend from an arboreal position in vegetation and seek shelter on the ground in and around the base of these same plants or under rocks and other debris, where they are insulated to some degree against the cold air of the atmosphere. Because external temperatures essentially dictate rates of metabolism in ectotherms, the amount of food that these geckos will consume varies depending on the temperature and weather; they will feed frequently in spring and summer and much less in the colder seasons of autumn and winter.

===Defensive behaviour in North Island &quot;Naultinus&quot;===
The four species of North Island &quot;Naultinus&quot; exhibit, to varying degrees, defensive behaviours which involve &quot;gaping&quot; to reveal the vivid coloration of the interior of their mouthes - bright red in &quot;flavirictus&quot; and deep blue in &quot;grayi&quot;, &quot;elegans&quot; and &quot;punctatus&quot; - and, in some cases, aggressive lunges and a strange sort of vocalization which has been described as a &quot;barking sound&quot;. These behaviours are an adaptation to startle and scare off potential predators and so to prevent the lizards from being eaten and have even been observed by people working against quite large mammalian predators such as the domestic cat. All four North Island &quot;Naultinus&quot; species will exhibit &quot;gaping&quot; behaviour when threatened but in addition &quot;grayi&quot; and &quot;punctatus&quot; will lunge aggressively at the potential predator in question, often barking as they do so. One source suggests that this pugnacious behaviour is more a function of protection for an adult&#x27;s young, as they are only said to exhibit this behaviour in the presence of juveniles – the source saying that, by contrast, &quot;in the absence of young individuals (they) are usually very docile and easy to handle&quot;. Like all New Zealand lizards, &quot;Naultinus&quot; species will shed their tails to escape from predators but because they are prehensile and used for grasping as they climb, they are much more reluctant to shed them than their close relatives in genus &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot;.

==Reproduction and life history==
While most species of geckos in other parts of the world live for just a few years, &quot;Naultinus&quot; are very long lived in comparison - they have been known to live for 30 years or more All New Zealand geckos and indeed, all New Zealand lizards – except one species of skink – are viviparous, which is in contrast to most of the world geckos which are oviparous. Females will actively move from areas of higher or lower temperature to thermoregulate, in order to provide optimal temperatures for the development of their young inside them. The young of all species are born a rich, velvety green, often with a series of markings on either side of the spine which can be white, yellow or tan. The colouration changes to the normal pattern and colour of the adult at 15–18 months, around the time that young animals move out of their parental territories to set up territories of their own. One explanation postulated for this is that; &quot; the function is recognition of juveniles by adults, it ensures that there is no danger of very young males being attacked or driven away from the family group by territorially minded adult males&quot;. Gestation period in New Zealand geckos is variable but observations of animals in captivity suggest that it is usually a relatively long process, usually around 8–9 months - similar to that of humans.

==&quot;Naultinus&quot; and humans==

===In culture===
Reptiles in New Zealand were well known to Māori in pre-European times and featured in many carvings, some of which obviously depict tuatara and others which depict lizards. The body shape of many examples suggests that they are geckos, though skinks also seem to be depicted. With the exception of the Tuatara, which was frequently eaten, lizards were regarded with abhorrence by Māori and &quot;Naultinus&quot; in particular; sightings of &quot;Naultinus&quot; were regarded as bad omens.

===As pets===
&quot;Naultinus&quot; can legally be kept in captivity as pets in New Zealand, provided one has an appropriate permit from DOC and hundreds are kept in private collections all over the country. &quot;Elegans&quot;, &quot;grayii&quot; and &quot;punctatus&quot; can all be kept on an &quot;A permit&quot;, which is the entry level license given to new keepers, while the remaining species in the genus require a &quot;B permit&quot; for which several years experience keeping geckos is required. In the past, animals could be collected from the wild to add to captive collections and this is how people typically used to enter the hobby; this changed in 1981 when all species of native gecko were granted legal protection, with the exception of two species of &quot;Hoplodactylus&quot;, the forest gecko (&quot;Hoplodactylus ganulatus&quot;) and common gecko (&quot;Hoplodactylus maculatus&quot;) - these two species were later also granted full protection in 1996. These days, keepers must obtain their founder stock from an existing, licensed breeder and animals can only be given away or swapped; sale of any sort of native lizard commercially is illegal. A condition for granting an &quot;A permit&quot; is an inspection by DOC to ensure adequate quality of caging is provided and detailed records of changes in a collection must be kept; recording births, deaths, escapes and animals exchanged, received or given away, in annual forms submitted to DOC, are all legal requirement of the permit. Many &quot;Naultinus&quot; keepers are members of The New Zealand Herpetological Society, which acts as a community hub for New Zealand Herpetoculturalists. &quot;Naultinus&quot; in private collections are often selectively bred for certain colours and patterns of colouration. DOC has in recent years begun sourcing &quot;Naultinus&quot; (particularly &quot;punctatus&quot;) for reintroductions to predator-free offshore islands from private collections, on the condition that the animals are in good health and of pure genetic origin (i.e.: they haven&#x27;t hybridized with other species).

&quot;Naultinus&quot; are also kept in captivity by enthusiasts in overseas countries but it should be stressed that trade is incredibly difficult, and one must obtain adequate CITES permits for importation and exportation. This process is regulated by the CITES Management Authority, which ascertains whether or not founding stock were obtained by a keeper in a particular country prior to 1981. This is often quite difficult, and usually prohibitive of international trade between Europe (where most stock resides outside of New Zealand) and other countries.

===Threats and decline===
Collectively, the species of genus &quot;Naultinus&quot; have a very wide range over most of New Zealand&#x27;s land area and yet all of them are now increasingly rare and hard to find. This is in stark contrast to anecdotal reports among NZ herpetoculturalists who found them abundant in suitable habitat (such as regenerating bush in the Marlborough Sounds) in the 1960s from which they have now all but vanished. The three major factors thought to be responsible for this decline are; habitat destruction, predation by introduced mammalian species and poaching for the illegal pet trade.

Barking geckos were common in shrublands all around the Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have declined enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island but there are so few animals left in wild populations in the region that they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the &quot;Naultinus &quot;released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby &quot;Naultinus&quot;. &quot;Naultinus gemmeus&quot; are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.

====Predation by invasive species====
&quot;Naultinus&quot; are preyed on by a number of invasive mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels may be just as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the &#x27;90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can&#x27;t defend themselves against attack. This would mean that &quot;Naultinus&quot; sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, &quot;Naultinus&quot; are also preyed on by introduced bird species - mynas have been observed plucking &quot;Naultinus&quot; from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known &quot;Naultinus&quot; sites in the South Island.

====Habitat destruction====
Habitat destruction by the encroachment of suburban areas into forested &quot;Naultinus&quot; habitat both directly destroys the ecosystems in which the animals live, as well as also facilitating further decline by increasing the size of local cat and rodent populations. A unique population of &quot;Naultinus gemmeus&quot; near Hakatarema Pass, east of Twizel which displayed unusual colouration and a distinctive genetic profile was entirely destroyed when its forest habitat was cleared by a bulldozer for urban development.

====Poaching====
New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Naultinus&quot; are highly prized by international lizard collectors for three main reasons; firstly they have very attractive colouration and indeed, have been referred to by some as &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful geckos&quot;. Secondly, they are day active and so are out and about when their keepers are awake and thirdly, they are cold tolerant, coming from New Zealand&#x27;s strongly seasonal temperate habitats – since most collectors are wealthy hobbyists in developed countries in places like North America, Europe and Japan – also temperate areas – this means they do not require heat lamps when kept in terrariums. All this adds up to strong demand for these animals on the black market for the illegal pet trade – &quot;dozens of these protected reptiles are poached from the wild each year, when even low-level poaching could mean the difference between survival and extinction for small, isolated populations&quot;. All endemic New Zealand lizard species including all species of &quot;Naultinus&quot; are protected by law both under the New Zealand Wildlife Act 1953 and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In an effort to clamp down on continual poaching, DOC attempted to get tighter controls placed on trade in &quot;Naultinus&quot; in 2002 under the CITES agreement but the request was denied, however, fines and periods of imprisonment under the Wildlife Act 1953 and Trade in Endangered Species Act 1989 were increased in 2004 in an attempt to deter further illegal collecting and trading of these animals.

In early 2010 a Mexican man and a Swiss national with US citizenship were caught in Christchurch airport attempting to smuggle 16 &quot;Naultinus gemmeus&quot; out of the country. They were jailed for 15 weeks – not enough to have them banned from ever returning to NZ –something that DOC are investigating changing for future cases. The Judge for the case, Judge Raoul Neave commented that &quot;a significant increase in the sentencing could be desirable&quot; in such cases. &quot;Naultinus&quot; have also been illegally taken/stolen from wildlife parks in the past; one &quot;rudis&quot; and two &quot;grayi&quot; were stolen from Orana Wildlife Park in 2006 though they were later found, unharmed, by police; their captors, two local New Zealand citizens, were arrested and charged.

===Conservation===
There is a critical lack of scientific research that has been done on &quot;Naultinus&quot; species and this fact, combined with the behaviourally and visually cryptic nature of the genus pose major challenges to their conservation management. For many &quot;Naultinus&quot; species, (examples include &quot;grayii&quot;,&quot;stellatus&quot; and &quot;rudis&quot;) there is a complete lack of accurate data in key areas such as distribution, abundance and recruitment rate (primarily because they are visually and behaviourally cryptic)- these types of information are critical to developing conservation management plans and make the conservation status of these species very difficult to determine; Some species have not had a single scientific study carried out on them, simply because they are so hard to find. The behaviourally cryptic aspect relates to the previously described behaviour whereby &quot;Naultinus&quot; will descend to ground level to hide in vegetation and shelter from cold and poor weather conditions; whole populations will appear to vanish and no amount of searching will turn them up, only for them to &quot;reappear&quot; when the weather improves. These &quot;disappearing acts&quot; have meant that the local extinction of many &quot;Naultinus&quot; populations has been overlooked because they were temporarily dismissed as simply being hard to find while sheltering from bad weather.

Searches for &quot;Naultinus&quot; are often inconclusive because the animals simply avoid detection. Improved detection methods would allow scientists to monitor populations much more accurately and a number of different studies in recent years have been doing research into this area – some key ideas are a new type of cover mounted on trees for animals to hide in, pheremone lures and even terriers trained to pick up on the scent of native geckos. &quot;Naultinus&quot; have been reintroduced to some predator free areas and are present at other locations where their habitat is protected and where pest control is being carried out but because &quot;Naultinus&quot; have a very slow breeding rate, recovery of populations is inevitably a relatively slow and gradual process.

<text>The genus Nephrurus, collectively referred to as the knob-tailed geckos (or “knob-tails”), comprises several species of small, desert-dwelling, drought-tolerant Australian gecko. They are named for their stubby, knob-like tails, and are also easily identified by their rather large eyes. This adaptation of enlarged eyes is indicative of an animal’s lifestyle being predominantly crepuscular or nocturnal.

==Description==
Lizards of this genus are easily distinguished by their short bodies, large heads, small legs, and short, carrot-shaped tails that often end in a small knob.
==Species==
The following 11 species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Nephrurus amyae&quot; – Centralian rough knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus asper&quot; – rough knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus cinctus&quot; – northern banded knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus deleani&quot; – Pernatty knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus eromanga&quot; 
*&quot;Nephrurus laevissimus&quot; – smooth knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus levis&quot; – smooth knob-tailed gecko
**&quot;Nephrurus levis levis&quot; 
**&quot;Nephrurus levis occidentalis&quot; 
**&quot;Nephrurus levis pilbarensis&quot; 
*&quot;Nephrurus sheai&quot; – Kimberley rough knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus stellatus&quot; – stellate knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus vertebralis&quot; – midline knob-tailed gecko
*&quot;Nephrurus wheeleri&quot; – banded knob-tailed gecko
The former &quot;Nephrurus milii&quot; , is now &quot;Underwoodisaurus milii&quot; – barking gecko.

==As pets==
Some species are sold and captive bred as pets such as &quot;Nephrurus amyae&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus asper&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus cinctus&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus deleani&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus laevissimus&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus levis&quot;, &quot;Nephrurus vertebralis&quot; and &quot;Nephrurus wheeleri&quot;.

<text>William George Zane Jr. (born February 24, 1966) is an American actor. His breakthrough role was in the 1989 Australian film &quot;Dead Calm&quot;, a performance that earned him a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actor. He has since appeared in numerous films and television series, and starred as the main antagonist Caledon Hockley in the epic film &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), for which he and the rest of the ensemble cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Zane&#x27;s other film roles include Kit Walker / The Phantom in the superhero film &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1996), &quot;Match&quot; in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise, Lieutenant Val Kozlowski in &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; (1990), The Collector in &quot;Demon Knight&quot; (1995), Curtis Zampf in &quot;The Believer&quot; (2001), and Richard Miller in the &quot;Sniper&quot; film series. He also played the recurring role of John Justice Wheeler in the second season of the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and provided the voice of Ansem in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002).

==Early life==
Zane was born in Chicago to Thalia and William George Zane Sr.; both were professional actors and founders of a school for medical technicians. His parents are of Greek descent (from Chios through his mother and Mani through his father); and his family&#x27;s original surname, &quot;Zanetakos&quot;, was anglicized to &quot;Zane&quot; by his parents. He grew up in the Greek Orthodox faith. He has an older sister, Lisa Zane, who is an actress and singer.

After completing a year of school at The American School in Switzerland (TASIS), Zane graduated from Francis W. Parker School and attended Harand Camp of the Theater Arts in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.

==Career==
===1980s===
Zane&#x27;s first two screen roles were in the science fiction films &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Critters&quot; in 1986, around the same time he appeared in the music videos for Sheena Easton&#x27;s songs &quot;Do It For Love&quot; and &quot;Magic of Love&quot;. In 1988, he played Tony Gambini alongside Jessica Fletcher in &quot;Murder, She Wrote: A Very Good Year for Murder&quot;. Zane also appeared in an episode of &quot;Matlock&quot; entitled &quot;The Nurse&quot;. In 1989 he reprised his henchman role in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. Earlier that same year, Zane gained international recognition with the role of villain Hughie Warriner in the thriller &quot;Dead Calm&quot;, alongside Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill. He also starred in the NBC film &quot;The Case of the Hillside Stranglers&quot; (1989), and Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;no budget&quot; debut &quot;Going Overboard&quot; (1989) which was not released to a wider audience until 1996.

===1990s===
Zane&#x27;s first starring role was in a 1990 independent film, the low budget science fiction thriller &quot;Megaville&quot;. In 1990, he also co-starred in the film &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;, a film version of a 1944 film about a World War II Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, as the bombardier. Zane also forayed into television work, and in 1991 he appeared as John Justice Wheeler in several episodes of David Lynch&#x27;s hit TV-show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In 1992 Zane co-starred alongside Tilda Swinton in the film adaptation of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;. In 1993, he played the Shakespearean actor &quot;Mr. Fabian&quot; in &quot;Tombstone&quot;, took a starring role in &quot;Sniper&quot; he also starred alongside Mario Van Peebles as a cold-blooded and corrupt Colonel Graham in &quot;Posse&quot; and also in Lake Consequence and played a playboy named Harry, posing as the elusive, albeit fake Damon Bradley alongside Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. in &quot;Only You&quot;.

He also starred in a couple of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; productions, including &quot;Tales From the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight&quot;, where he played a henchman of Satan called The Collector, and the episode &quot;Well-Cooked Hams&quot;, where he played a poorly skilled magician who killed to steal good tricks from other magicians. In 1996, Zane played the eponymous classic comic book hero in the big budget action film &quot;The Phantom&quot;, based on Lee Falk&#x27;s comic.

Zane played the snobbish millionaire misanthrope Caledon Hockley in James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 blockbuster &quot;Titanic&quot;. This role as Rose&#x27;s (played by Kate Winslet) fiancé earned him an MTV Movie Award nomination for &quot;Best Villain&quot; and a Blockbuster Entertainment Award. Along with the rest of the ensemble cast, he was nominated for a SAG award.

In 1998, he starred in and produced &quot;I Woke Up Early the Day I Died&quot;, a silent film based on Ed Wood&#x27;s last script, intended as a parody on bad filmmaking. He won several awards at the B-Movie Film Festival, including Best Movie and Best Actor, for this work. The year after, he starred opposite Timothy Dalton, Bruce Payne, Sean Pertwee and Leonor Varela (who became his fiancé after shooting ended) in a TV-movie about Cleopatra. Zane played the part of Mark Antony.

The same year, he voiced John Rolfe in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot; and Etrigan the Demon in an episode of &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

===2000s===
Zane was instrumental in realizing the critically acclaimed film &quot;The Believer&quot;, which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Film Festival in 2001. In it, he portrayed neo-fascist Curtis Zampf, and starred opposite Ryan Gosling. The same year, he also had a cameo as himself in the comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot;.

Zane appeared on Broadway in &quot;Chicago&quot;, where he played lawyer Billy Flynn.

Zane also had a recurring role in the television series &quot;Charmed&quot; in which he played poetry-loving ex-demon Drake. He also provided the voice of Ansem, the main antagonist of the 2002 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, opposite Haley Joel Osment. Though archive audio of Zane was later used for &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, he was replaced by Richard Epcar for the rest of the series from &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; onwards. Zane&#x27;s performance, however, was kept for the &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot; remaster in &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot;.

In 2006, Zane starred in Arthur Allan Seidelman&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; as an acerbic gay dance instructor opposite Claire Bloom. In the same year, he appeared in the Turkish film &quot;Valley of the Wolves Iraq&quot; (&quot;Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak&quot; in Turkish), part of the Kurtlar Vadisi franchise. The film tells the story of the U.S. Army run amok in Iraq, eventually brought into check by a Turkish soldier. Zane plays Sam William Marshall, a cruel U.S. soldier who is the main antagonist in the film.
He took over Timothy Olyphant&#x27;s role as Christina Applegate&#x27;s ex-boyfriend on &quot;Samantha Who?&quot;. The show, however, was not renewed for the 2009–2010 season.

Zane is a principal at RadioactiveGiant, a film and television production and distribution company.

===2010s===
Zane starred in the 2012 action/thriller film &quot;The Kill Hole&quot;, and in January 2017 he appeared in a commercial for KFC as a gold-colored Colonel Sanders to pitch the restaurant chain&#x27;s newest limited-time flavor, Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ chicken. Zane also appeared in an episode of &quot;Community&quot;, season 6&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Safety Features&quot;.

Zane was also featured in two episodes of &quot;The Boys&quot; portraying a fictional version of himself who made a movie with Popclaw and also attended a comic convention with Tara Reid. In season 3, Zane appeared as himself portraying Alastair Adana in the Vought film &quot;Not Without My Dolphin&quot;.

In 2024, Zane portrayed Larry Ray in the Lifetime film &quot;Devil on Campus: The Larry Ray Story&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature films.

==Personal life==
Zane was married to actress Lisa Collins from 1989 to 1995. He was also engaged for a time to Chilean actress Leonor Varela who was his co-star in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1999), a television film.

Later Zane was engaged to British model-turned-actress Kelly Brook; he met her when they co-starred in the movie &quot;Survival Island&quot; (2005), also known as &quot;Three&quot;. They split in April 2008, got back together again shortly after that, and ended the relationship in August 2008. Zane dated Croatian model Jasmina Hdagha in 2010; they broke up later that year.

Through a friend he met American model Candice Neil with whom he has two daughters; they became engaged. Their first daughter, Ava Catherine, was born in 2011, and their second daughter, Gia, was born in 2014.

In 1999, Zane participated in the first Gumball 3000 rally, driving a 1964 Aston Martin DB5. He is an abstract expressionist painter and he has had many solo and group exhibitions.

==Other media projects==

<text>Oedura is a genus of medium to large geckos, lizards in the family Diplodactylidae. The genus is endemic to Australia. Species in the genus are referred to by the common name velvet geckos.

==Geographic range==
Most of the species of &quot;Oedura&quot; occur in northern and eastern Australia, with further isolates in the arid zone (Pilbara, Central Ranges and Flinders Ranges).

==Behaviour and habitat==
Geckos of the genus &quot;Oedura&quot; are mostly arboreal and nocturnal, and have flattened bodies that are distinctly patterned. They are secretive tree or rock dwellers, usually concealing themselves beneath peeling bark or in cracks and crevices. A species found in the Kimberley region, &quot;Oedura filicipoda&quot;, is named for the plumose fringing on the toes that may assist in clinging to rocky overhangs. All species are adapted to their dry conditions and can go for months without food or water.

==Taxonomy==
The content of the genus &quot;Oedura&quot; has been reduced by Oliver et al. in 2012, when they transferred four species to the genus &quot;Amalosia&quot; and erected two new monotypic genera, &quot;Hesperoedura&quot; for &quot;Oedura reticulata&quot; and &quot;Nebulifera&quot; for &quot;Oedura robusta&quot;.

==Species==
The type species for the genus is &quot;Oedura marmorata&quot;, first described by John Edward Gray in 1842. The following is a list of the 19 valid species:
*&quot;Oedura argentea&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura bella&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura castelnaui&quot; – northern velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura cincta&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura coggeri&quot; – northern spotted velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura elegans&quot; – elegant velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura filicipoda&quot; – fringe-toed velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura fimbria&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura gemmata&quot; – jewelled velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura gracilis&quot; – gracile velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura jowalbinna&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura lineata&quot; – Arcadia velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura luritja&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura marmorata&quot; – marbled velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura monilis&quot; – ocellated velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura murrumanu&quot; – limestone range velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura nesos&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura picta&quot; – ornate velvet gecko
*&quot;Oedura tryoni&quot; – southern spotted velvet gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Oedura&quot;.

==Species formerly in &quot;Oedura&quot;==

Transferred to genus &quot;Amalosia&quot; :
*&quot;Oedura jacovae&quot; – valid as &quot;Amalosia jacovae&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura lesueurii&quot; – Lesueur&#x27;s velvet gecko, valid as &quot;Amalosia lesueurii&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura obscura&quot; – slim velvet gecko, valid as &quot;Amalosia obscura&quot; 
*&quot;Oedura rhombifer&quot; – zigzag velvet gecko, valid as &quot;Amalosia rhombifer&quot; 
Transferred to genus &quot;Hesperoedura&quot; :
*&quot;Oedura reticulata&quot; – reticulated velvet gecko, valid as &quot;Hesperoedura reticulata&quot; 
Transferred to genus &quot;Nebulifera&quot; :
*&quot;Oedura robusta&quot; – robust velvet gecko, valid as &quot;Nebulifera robusta&quot;

<text>Phyllurus is a small genus of Australian leaf-tailed geckos, lizards in the family Carphodactylidae. Rarely seen outside their native habitat, they are notable for their highly effective camouflage which is in part aided by the spiny tubercles that cover every body part.

Most member species, except for &quot;P. caudiannulatus&quot;, &quot;P. gulbaru&quot; and &quot;P. kabikabi&quot;, have very flattened, leaf-shaped tails. Some of these species have recently been reassigned to the genus &quot;Saltuarius&quot;. The &quot;Phyllurus&quot; geckos resemble the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos of Madagascar. This is an example of convergent evolution because they are not closely related. As of 2023, Scawfell Island leaf-tailed gecko is the last known species of gecko to be found in Australia.

<text>The Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), often simply just collared dove, is a dove species native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. It has also been introduced to Japan, North and Central America, and the islands in the Caribbean.

== Taxonomy ==
The Hungarian naturalist Imre Frivaldszky first described the Eurasian collared dove with the scientific name &quot;Columba risoria&quot; varietas &quot;C. decaocto&quot; in 1838, considering it a wild variety of the domesticated barbary dove. The type locality is Plovdiv in Bulgaria. It is now placed in genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; that was described in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte.

The Burmese collared dove (&quot;S. xanthocycla&quot;) was formerly considered a subspecies of the Eurasian collared dove, but was split as a distinct species by the IOC in 2021. Two other subspecies were formerly sometimes accepted, &quot;S. d. stoliczkae&quot; from Turkestan in central Asia and &quot;S. d. intercedens&quot; from southern India and Sri Lanka; they are now considered junior synonyms of the species.

The Eurasian collared dove is also closely related to the Sunda collared dove of southeast Asia and the African collared dove of Sub-Saharan Africa, forming a superspecies with these. Identification from the African collared dove is very difficult with silent birds, with the African species being marginally smaller and paler, but the calls are very distinct, a soft purring &quot;Cou&#x27;crrrrroouw&quot; in the African collared dove quite unlike the Eurasian collared dove&#x27;s three-note cooing.

===Etymology===
The generic name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;streptos&quot; meaning &quot;collar&quot; and &quot;peleia&quot; meaning &quot;dove&quot;. The specific epithet, &quot;decaocto&quot;, is Greek for &quot;eighteen&quot;. The association of the dove with the number eighteen has its roots in a Greek myth. A maid who worked hard for little money was unhappy that she was only paid 18 silver coins a year and begged the gods to let the world know how little she was rewarded by her mistress. Zeus, hearing her pleas, created the collared dove, which has called out &quot;decaocto&quot; ever since to tell the world of the maid&#x27;s mistreatment. In several Balkan languages, the number 18 is a three-syllable word (e.g. &quot;tiz-en-nyolc&quot; in Frivaldszky&#x27;s native Hungarian), so is ultimately onomatopoeic from the bird&#x27;s call.

As most of its European range in the 19th century, including its type locality, was within the Turkish-controlled Ottoman Empire, its name in many European languages translates as Turkish dove, e.g. Danish Tyrkerdue, German Türkentaube, French Tourterelle turque.

==Description==

The Eurasian collared dove is a medium-sized dove, distinctly smaller than the wood pigeon, similar in length to a rock dove but slimmer and longer-tailed, and slightly larger than the related European turtle dove, with an average length of from tip of beak to tip of tail, with a wingspan of , and a weight of . It is grey-buff to pinkish-grey overall, a little darker above than below, with a blue-grey underwing patch. The tail feathers are grey-buff above, and dark grey and tipped white below; the outer tail feathers are also tipped whitish above. It has a black half-collar edged with white on its nape from which it gets its name. The short legs are red and the bill is black. The iris is red, but from a distance the eyes appear to be black, as the pupil is relatively large and only a narrow rim of reddish-brown iris can be seen around the black pupil. The eye is surrounded by a small area of bare skin, which is either white or yellow. The two sexes are virtually indistinguishable; juveniles differ in having a poorly developed collar, and a brown iris. The subspecies &quot;S. d. xanthocycla&quot; differs in having yellow rather than white eye-rings, darker grey on the head and the underparts a slightly darker pink.

The song is a three-syllable &quot;goo-GOO-goo&quot;, with stress placed on the second syllable. The Eurasian collared dove also makes a harsh loud screeching call lasting about two seconds, particularly in flight just before landing. A rough way to describe the screeching sound is a &quot;hah-hah.&quot;

Eurasian collared doves cooing in early spring are sometimes mistakenly reported as the calls of early-arriving common cuckoos and, as such, a mistaken sign of spring&#x27;s return.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian collared dove is not migratory, but is strongly dispersive. Over the last century, it has been one of the great colonisers of the bird world, travelling far beyond its native range to colonise colder countries, becoming a permanent resident in several of them. Its original range at the end of the 19th century was warm temperate and subtropical Asia from Turkey east to southern China and south through India to Sri Lanka. In 1838 it was reported in Bulgaria, but not until the 20th century did it expand across Europe, appearing in parts of the Balkans between 1900 and 1920, and then spreading rapidly northwest, reaching Germany in 1945, Great Britain by 1953 (breeding for the first time in 1956), Ireland in 1959, and the Faroe Islands in the early 1970s. Subsequent spread was &#x27;sideways&#x27; from this fast northwestern spread, reaching northeast to north of the Arctic Circle in Norway and east to the Ural Mountains in Russia, and southwest to the Canary Islands and northern Africa from Morocco to Egypt, by the end of the 20th century. In the east of its range, it has also spread northeast to most of central and northern China, and locally (probably introduced) in Japan. It has also reached Iceland as a vagrant (41 records up to 2006), but has not colonised successfully there.

===Invasive status in North America===
In 1974, fewer than 50 Eurasian collared doves escaped captivity in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas. From the Bahamas, the species spread to Florida, and is now found in nearly every state in the U.S., as well as in Mexico. In Arkansas (the United States), the species was recorded first in 1989 and since then has grown in numbers and is now present in 42 of 75 counties in the state. It spread from the southeastern corner of the state in 1997 to the northwestern corner in five years, covering a distance of about at a rate of per year. This is more than double the rate of per year observed in Europe. As of 2012, few negative impacts have been demonstrated in Florida, where the species is most prolific. However, the species is known as an aggressive competitor and there is concern that as populations continue to grow, native birds will be out-competed by the invaders. One study, however, found that Eurasian collared doves are not more aggressive or competitive than native mourning doves, despite similar dietary preferences.

Population growth has ceased in areas where the species has long been established, such as Florida, and in these regions, recent observations suggest the population is in decline. The population is still growing exponentially in areas of more recent introduction; up to 2015, the Eurasian collared dove experienced a greater than 1.5% yearly population increase throughout nearly the entirety of its North American range. Carrying capacities appear to be highest in areas with higher temperatures and intermediate levels of development, such as suburban areas and some agricultural areas.

While the spread of disease to native species has not been recorded in a study, Eurasian collared doves are known carriers of the parasite &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; and pigeon paramyxovirus type 1. Both &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; and pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 can spread to native birds via commingling at feeders and by consumption of doves by predators. Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 is an emergent disease and has the potential to affect domestic poultry, making the Eurasian collared dove a threat to not only native biodiversity, but a possible economic threat, as well.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

===Breeding===

Eurasian collared doves typically breed close to human habitation wherever food resources are abundant and trees are available for nesting; almost all nests are within of inhabited buildings. The female lays two white eggs in a stick nest, which she incubates during the night and which the male incubates during the day. Incubation lasts between 14 and 18 days, with the young fledging after 15 to 19 days. Breeding occurs throughout the year when abundant food is available, though only rarely in winter in areas with cold winters such as northeastern Europe. Three to four broods per year are common, although up to six broods in a year have been recorded. Eurasian collared doves are a monogamous species, and share parental duties when caring for young.

The male&#x27;s mating display is a ritual flight, which, as with many other pigeons, consists of a rapid, near-vertical climb to height followed by a long glide downward in a circle, with the wings held below the body in an inverted &quot;V&quot; shape. At all other times, flight is typically direct using fast and clipped wing beats and without use of gliding.

===Food and feeding===
The Eurasian collared dove is not wary and often feeds very close to human habitation, including visiting bird tables; the largest populations are typically found around farms where spilt grain is frequent around grain stores or where livestock are fed. It is a gregarious species and sizeable winter flocks form around food supplies such as grain (its main food), seeds, shoots, and insects. Flocks most commonly number between 10 and 50, but flocks of up to 10,000 have been recorded.

<doc id="323990" wikidata="Q932139" url="?curid=323990" title="Cash crop">
<text>A cash crop, also called profit crop, is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit. It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm. The term is used to differentiate a marketed crop from a staple crop (&quot;subsistence crop&quot;) in subsistence agriculture, which is one fed to the producer&#x27;s own livestock or grown as food for the producer&#x27;s family.

In earlier times, cash crops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm&#x27;s total yield, while today, especially in developed countries and among smallholders almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue. In the least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value.

Prices for major cash crops are set in international trade markets with global scope, with some local variation (termed as &quot;basis&quot;) based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance. A consequence of this is that a nation, region, or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper crop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets. This system has been criticized by traditional farmers. Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations.

==Globalization==

Issues involving subsidies and trade barriers on such crops have become controversial in discussions of globalization. Many developing countries take the position that the current international trade system is unfair because it has caused tariffs to be lowered in industrial goods while allowing for low tariffs and agricultural subsidies for agricultural goods. This makes it difficult for a developing nation to export its goods overseas, and forces developing nations to compete with imported goods which are exported from developed nations at artificially low prices. The practice of exporting at artificially low prices is known as dumping, and is illegal in most nations. Controversy over this issue led to the collapse of the Cancún trade talks in 2003, when the Group of 22 refused to consider agenda items proposed by the European Union unless the issue of agricultural subsidies was addressed.

==Per climate zones==

===Arctic===
The Arctic climate is generally not conducive for the cultivation of cash crops. However, one potential cash crop for the Arctic is &quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot;, a hardy plant used as a medicinal herb that grows in the Arctic. There is currently consumer demand for the plant, but the available supply is less than the demand (as of 2011).

===Temperate===
Cash crops grown in regions with a temperate climate include many cereals (wheat, rye, corn, barley, oats), oil-yielding crops (e.g. grapeseed, mustard seeds), vegetables (e.g. potatoes), lumber yielding trees (e.g. Spruce, Pines, Firs), tree fruit or top fruit (e.g. apples, cherries) and soft fruit (e.g. strawberries, raspberries).

===Subtropical===
In regions with a subtropical climate, oil-yielding crops (e.g. soybeans), cotton, rice, tobacco, indigo, citrus, pomegranates, and some vegetables and herbs are the predominant cash crops.

===Tropical===
In regions with a tropical climate, coffee, cocoa, sugar cane, bananas, oranges, cotton and jute are common cash crops. The oil palm is a tropical palm tree, and the fruit from it is used to make palm oil. The impact of climate change on the ranges of pests and diseasesespecially those of coffee, cocoa, and bananais commonly underestimated. Limiting temperature rise to is vital to maintaining productivity in the tropics.

==By continent and country==
===Africa===

Around 60 percent of African workers are employed in the agricultural sector, with about three-fifths of African farmers being subsistence farmers. For example, in Burkina Faso 85% of its residents (over two million people) are reliant upon cotton production for income, and over half of the country&#x27;s population lives in poverty. Larger farms tend to grow cash crops such as coffee, tea, cotton, cocoa, fruit and rubber. These farms, typically operated by large corporations, cover dozens of square kilometres and employ large numbers of laborers. Subsistence farms provide a source of food and a relatively small income for families, but generally fail to produce enough to make re-investment possible.

The situation in which African nations export crops while a significant number of people on the continent struggle with hunger has been blamed on developed countries, including the United States, Japan and the European Union. These countries protect their own agricultural sectors, through high import tariffs and offer subsidies to their farmers, which some have contended is leading to the overproduction of commodities such as cotton, grain and milk. The result of this is that the global price of such products is continually reduced until Africans are unable to compete in world markets, except in cash crops that do not grow easily in temperate climates.

Africa has realized significant growth in biofuel plantations, many of which are on lands which were purchased by British companies. &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; is a cash crop grown for biofuel production in Africa. Some have criticized the practice of raising non-food plants for export while Africa has problems with hunger and food shortages, and some studies have correlated the proliferation of land acquisitions, often for use to grow non-food cash crops with increasing hunger rates in Africa.
===Australia===
Australia produces significant amounts of lentils. It was estimated in 2010 that Australia would produce approximately 143,000 tons of lentils. Most of Australia&#x27;s lentil harvest is exported to the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.

===Italy===
Italy&#x27;s Cassa per il Mezzogiorno in 1950 led to the government implementing incentives to grow cash crops such as tomatoes, tobacco and citrus fruits. As a result, they created an over abundance of these crops causing an over saturation of these crops on the global market. This caused these crops to depreciate.

===United States===

Cash cropping in the United States dates back to the colonial period with crops like tobacco, indigo, cotton and others farmed on massive scales on southern plantations primarily fueled by black slave labor, even after the end of slavery this system continued in some form with the share cropping system where farmers would live and work on large plantations for a share of the crop to sell themselves. Cash cropping of fruits rose to prominence after the baby boomer generation and the end of World War II. It was seen as a way to feed the large population boom and continues to be the main factor in having an affordable food supply in the United States. According to the 1997 U.S. Census of Agriculture, 90% of the farms in the United States are still owned by families, with an additional 6% owned by a partnership. Cash crop farmers have utilized precision agricultural technologies combined with time-tested practices to produce affordable food. Based upon United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics for 2010, states with the highest fruit production quantities are California, Florida and Washington.


===Vietnam===
Coconut is a cash crop of Vietnam.

==Global cash crops==
Coconut palms are cultivated in more than 80 countries of the world, with a total production of 61 million tonnes per year. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying; coconut oil is also widely used in soaps and cosmetics.

==Sustainability of cash crops==
Approximately 70% of the world&#x27;s food is produced by 500 million smallholder farmers. For their livelihood they depend on the production of cash crops, basic commodities that are hard to differentiate in the market. The great majority (80%) of the world&#x27;s farms measure 2 hectares or less. These smallholder farmers are mainly found in developing countries and are often unorganized, illiterate or have only basic education. Smallholder farmers have little bargaining power and incomes are low, leading to a situation in which they cannot invest much in upscaling their businesses. In general, farmers lack access to agricultural inputs and finance, and do not have enough knowledge on good agricultural and business practices. These high level problems are in many cases threatening the future of agricultural sectors and theories start evolving on how to secure a sustainable future for agriculture. Sustainable market transformations are initiated in which industry leaders work together in a pre-competitive environment to change market conditions. Sustainable intensification focuses on facilitating entrepreneurial farmers. To stimulate farm investment, projects on access to finance for agriculture are also popping up. One example is the SCOPE methodology, an assessment tool that measures the management maturity and professionalism of producer organizations as to give financing organizations better insights in the risks involved in financing. Currently, agricultural finance is always considered risky and avoided by financial institutions.

==Black market cash crops==

Coca, opium poppies and cannabis are significant black market cash crops, the prevalence of which varies. In the United States, cannabis is considered by some to be the most valuable cash crop. In 2006, it was reported in a study by Jon Gettman, a marijuana policy researcher, that in contrast to government figures for legal crops such as corn and wheat and using the study&#x27;s projections for U.S. cannabis production at that time, cannabis was cited as &quot;the top cash crop in 12 states and among the top three cash crops in 30&quot;. The study also estimated cannabis production at the time (in 2006) to be valued at US$35.8 billion, which exceeded the combined value of corn at $23.3 billion and wheat at $7.5 billion.

<text>Rhacodactylus is a genus of medium to large geckos of the family Diplodactylidae. All species in this genus are found on the islands that make up New Caledonia.

Genus characteristics include long limbs and toes with well-developed lamellae. Some webbing occurs on the hind limbs and toes. &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; possess prehensile tails which also have lamellae to assist in climbing. These are for the most part arboreal geckos. &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; are nocturnal geckos.

The species are egg layers with the exception of &quot;Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus&quot; and &quot;R. trachycephalus&quot; which gives live birth, a characteristic only otherwise found in New Zealand geckos. They also feed on lizards, more so than any of the family. &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; geckos are sexually dimorphic, with the males possessing larger preanal pores than the females as well as a distinct hemipenis pocket.

Males tend to be stockier than females with the exception of &quot;R. auriculatus&quot; in which species the males are much slimmer than the females.

==Classification==

*Gargoyle gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus auriculatus&quot; 
*New Caledonian giant gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;
**&quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus aubrianus&quot;
**&quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus henkeli&quot; 
**&quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus leachianus&quot; 
*Greater rough-snouted giant gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus&quot;
*Lesser rough-snouted giant gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus trachycephalus&quot;
*Willi&#x27;s giant gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus willihenkeli&quot;

A revision of the giant geckos of New Caldonia found weak support for inclusion of some taxa allied to this genus, and these have been assigned to new combinations: 
* &quot;Correlophus ciliatus&quot;, crested gecko; formerly &quot;R. ciliatus&quot;
* &quot;Correlophus sarasinorum&quot;; formerly &quot;R. sarasinorum&quot;
* &quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot;; formerly &quot;R. chahoua&quot;

==Captivity==
The species are regarded as charismatic and popular with herpetologists. Details of the behaviour of these geckos in captivity, contrasted with a paucity of field observations, has produced extensive literature on the genus.

<text>Rhynchoedura is a genus of lizards in the family Diplodactylidae. It includes six species, commonly known as beaked geckos, all of which are endemic to the arid zone of the Australian outback.

Members of the genus are terrestrial and nocturnal, sheltering by day in spider burrows. They specialize in eating termites and are most abundant in open, recently burned areas. They can be characterized by their long bodies and narrow heads with enlarged scales at the tip of the snout. &quot;Rhynchoedura&quot; species are widespread and occupy a range of dry woodland, shrubland, grassland, and desert environments, and none are currently considered to be at risk of extinction.

The genus was traditionally regarded as monotypic, with the single species &quot;Rhynchoedura ornata&quot; named by Albert Günther in 1867. A second species was described in 1985, though without widespread recognition at the time. In 2011 an extensive revision sampling the population across Australia found overlooked genetic diversity in the genus and named four new cryptic species. Each &quot;Rhynchoedura&quot; species is native to a specific perennial river drainage, and active rivers during wet periods of the Neogene could have led to allopatric speciation within the genus.

<text>Kumru is a Turkish sandwich on a bun, typically with cheese, tomato, and spicy &quot;sujuk&quot; sausage. The name of this street food translates as &#x27;collared dove&#x27;, and derives from the shape of the sandwich. The original kumru was ring-shaped and covered with sesame seeds. The present one appeared in the mid-20th century in İzmir, and soon became very popular. The secret of its popularity is in its tasty and soft bread, specially produced by some local bakeries and restaurants with added chickpea sourdough. Some kumru vendors also serve it with pickled cucumbers, hot pepper, mayonnaise and ketchup.

<text>Saltuarius is a genus of larger Australian geckos, known collectively as leaf-tailed geckos. 

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Saltuarius&quot; was created in 1993 to accommodate some former members of the genus &quot;Phyllurus&quot;. These geckos appear very similar to the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos native to Madagascar. However, this is a convergent evolution.

==Etymology==
The genus name is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;keeper of the forest&quot;.

==Habitat and distribution==
The species in the genus &quot;Saltuarius&quot; inhabit Australia&#x27;s eastern coastal region, a vegetation composed of rainforests and dry Eucalyptus forests. &quot;Saltuarius cornutus&quot; and &quot;Saltuarius swaini&quot; are arboreal geckos, the remaining species live on rocky outcrops. They all need a high level of relative air humidity. The species from southern regions must hibernate for several months at temperatures varying between and .

==Reproduction==
These species invariably lay soft-shelled eggs which are buried in humid substrates.

==Species==
The following seven species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Saltuarius cornutus&quot; – northern leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius eximius&quot; – Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius kateae&quot; – Kate&#x27;s leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius moritzi&quot; – leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius salebrosus&quot; – rough-throated leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius swaini&quot; – southern leaf-tailed gecko
*&quot;Saltuarius wyberba&quot; – granite leaf-tailed gecko

The former &quot;Saltuarius occultus&quot; , the long-necked northern leaf-tailed gecko, is now &quot;Orraya occultus&quot;.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Saltuarius&quot;.

<doc id="324000" wikidata="Q2270135" url="?curid=324000" title="Underwoodisaurus">
<text>Underwoodisaurus is a small genus of Australian lizards in the family Carphodactylidae. Member species are commonly known as thick-tailed geckos, along with the species &quot;Uvidicolus sphyrurus&quot;.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot;, is in honour of British herpetologist Garth Leon Underwood.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot; has a complex taxonomic history, but the currently accepted taxonomic concept follows &amp; (2011), with a second species subsequently recognised by &amp; (2011). Reptile systematists nowadays recognise a distinct family, Carphodactylidae, for this and some related genera.

==Species==
There are two species which are recognised as being valid:
*&quot;Underwoodisaurus milii&quot; – thick-tailed gecko
*&quot;Underwoodisaurus seorsus&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot;. The species &quot;Uvidicolus sphyrurus&quot; is sometimes placed in the genus &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot;.

==Description==
Adults of some species of &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot; can reach a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of . Preanal pores are absent. The feet are generally &quot;bird-like&quot; with long slender digits, and the tail is carrot-shaped. The underside of the body is white, and the dorsal surface ranges from dark purplish-black through reddish-brown to pale fawn, with small white, yellow and black spots in patterns.

A thick tail is generally a sign of good health, although lack of thickness may indicate recent egg-laying.

==Geographic range and ==
The genus &quot;Underwoodisaurus&quot; is endemic to Australia. These geckoes are found in a range of habitats including wet coastal heathlands, wet sclerophyll forests, arid scrubland, rocky outcrops and stony hills in eucalypt woodland.

==Ecology==
Thick-tailed geckos shelter under leaf litter, around the bases of trees in loose bark, and in crevices.

They emerge in the evenings to hunt in open areas for crickets, cockroaches and huntsman spiders. They eat once every 3–4 days. When they see prey they will stare at it and wag their tails, then pounce. 
When alarmed, the thick-tailed gecko will make a barking sound or hiss. They will also raise their backs. 
One main predator is snakes.

==Reproduction==
Thick-tailed geckos lay up to 2 eggs and up to 10 clutches per year. The first clutch of eggs is usually infertile. When the female is gravid the eggs are visible through the skin. The eggs take about 65 days to hatch. Their breeding season is roughly July to February.

<doc id="324001" wikidata="Q349030" url="?curid=324001" title="Matt Bloom">
<text>Matthew Jason Bloom (born November 14, 1972) is an American retired professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he is the head trainer at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida.

Bloom is best known for his in-ring appearances with WWE as Prince Albert, Albert and A-Train from 1999 to 2004, and as Lord Tensai and Tensai from 2012 to 2014, as well as for his appearances in Japan from 2005 to 2012 with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah) as . Championships held by Bloom over the course of his career include the GHC Tag Team Championship, IWGP Tag Team Championship and WWF Intercontinental Championship.

==Early life==
Bloom was born in Peabody, Massachusetts. He attended Peabody Veterans Memorial High School, where he earned three letters in football and basketball, two in track and field, and one in baseball. Bloom also attended Camp Tevya in Brookline, New Hampshire in the early 1980s, and went on to attend the University of Pittsburgh, where he played football as an offensive tackle and an offensive guard. Bloom graduated in 1996 with a degree in sign language. Following the 1995 NFL draft, he was signed by the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent, but was eventually waived by the team. He then became a schoolteacher, teaching mathematics and English to children with behavioral problems and deaf children at Revere High School. After rewarding his three most apt students with a trip to a professional wrestling event, Bloom, who as a child had aspired to wrestle professionally, met wrestler and wrestling trainer Killer Kowalski and expressed an interest in learning how to wrestle. Kowalski invited Bloom to attend his school, and Bloom opted to leave teaching and train as a wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1997–1999)===
Bloom wrestled his first match in the WWA on May 15, 1998, facing Tiger Ali Singh in a loss, during his brief time in WWA he wrestled notable names such as Sgt. Slaughter and Bart Gunn. In November 1998, Bloom made his NWA debut losing to Shawn Stasiak. During his stay in NWA, Bloom and Bull Pain challenged Nick Dinsmore and Rob Conway for the NWA OVW Southern tag team titles ending in a no contest. He briefly wrestled as Baldo, a gimmick given to him by referee Freddy Sparta that saw him wear a fur rug to the ring.

After being introduced to talent scout Tom Prichard by George Steele, Bloom was hired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). After receiving supplementary training from Dory Funk Jr., Bloom was assigned to the Power Pro Wrestling developmental territory in Memphis, Tennessee, where he wrestled as Baldo. While wrestling in PPW, Bloom won both the Young Guns Championship and the Heavyweight Championship, and engaged in a feud with Memphis mainstay Jerry Lawler, where he defeated him to become the inaugural PPW Heavyweight champion.

=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment ===
==== Prince Albert (1999–2000) ====
Bloom debuted on WWF television on the April 11, 1999, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, saving Droz from a beating at the hands of Big Boss Man. Introduced as the personal body artist of Droz, Bloom was dubbed Prince Albert (a pun on the Prince Albert genital piercing). On the April 25 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Albert made his in-ring debut by teaming with Droz to defeat Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor. Albert&#x27;s first singles match occurred on the May 8 episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;, in which he lost to Meat. Shortly after, Albert and Droz formed a short-lived trio with Key. Albert picked up his first win in WWF on the June 27 edition of &quot;Heat&quot;, by defeating Val Venis in a street fight after assistance by Droz. Droz and Albert attacked Venis until his tag team partner The Godfather made the save. This led to Albert and Droz facing Godfather and Venis in a match on the July 4 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;.

Droz and Albert continued to team together and received several shots for the WWF Tag Team Championship against Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) but failed to win the titles. Droz and Albert then resolved their rivalry with Venis and Godfather by losing to them in a street fight on the July 26 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. They also competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match at SummerSlam on August 22, to earn a future title shot, but were eliminated by Edge and Christian. Albert received his first singles title shot against D-Lo Brown for his European and Intercontinental Championship on the August 21 episode of &quot;Shotgun&quot;. The team of Droz and Albert prematurely disbanded when Droz was legitimately paralyzed in October 1999, and Albert would then unsuccessfully challenge Brown for the European Championship on the October 17 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;. Shortly after, Albert became the protege of the Big Boss Man, and became a part of Boss Man&#x27;s team, consisting of Mideon and Viscera, who lost to The Big Show in a handicap Survivor Series match at Survivor Series on November 14. Boss Man and Albert would challenge Big Show for the WWF Championship in a losing effort in a handicap match on the December 13 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;.

On January 23, 2000, Albert competed in his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble as the #21 entrant. He was eliminated by Kane. Shortly after, the team of Albert and Boss Man separated following the debut of Bull Buchanan, who formed a tag team with the Big Boss Man.

==== T &amp; A (2000–2001) ====

In March, Prince Albert was recruited by Trish Stratus to form a tag team with Test, with his name being shortened to Albert at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2 in a tag team match with Test against Head Cheese (Al Snow and Steve Blackman), which Test and Albert won. The tag team, known as T &amp; A, competed in the tag team division throughout 2000, and feuded with various rival tag teams. Their first rivalry was against Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von), which saw the two teams trade wins in a series of matches including a match at Backlash on April 30, which T &amp; A won. At King of the Ring on June 25, T &amp; A competed against Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty), The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff), and Edge and Christian in a four corners elimination match for the Tag Team Championship, which they failed to win. Following the event, T &amp; A began feuding with Hardy Boyz, which led to T &amp; A and Trish Stratus taking on Hardy Boyz and Lita in a losing effort at Fully Loaded on July 23.

In October, T &amp; A began feuding with the Acolytes Protection Agency (Bradshaw and Faarooq), leading to T &amp; A and Stratus facing Lita and APA in a match at No Mercy on October 22, which ended in a no contest. T &amp; A and Stratus would then begin feuding with Holly Cousins (Crash, Hardcore and Molly), which lead to T &amp; A and Stratus facing Crash, Molly and Steve Blackman in a match at Survivor Series on November 19, which Stratus and T &amp; A lost. The feud ended on the November 27 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, where Holly Cousins defeated T &amp; A and Stratus. At Rebellion on December 2, T &amp; A competed against Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian in a triple threat elimination tables match, which Dudley Boyz won. On the December 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, T &amp; A dissolved when Bloom attacked Test under the orders of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley after T &amp; A won a match against Too Cool. As a result, Albert and Stratus briefly feuded with Test, defeating him in a handicap match on the January 8, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;.

==== X-Factor and The Zoo Crew (2001–2002) ====

After moving to singles competition, Albert participated in the 2001 Royal Rumble as the #17 entrant, being eliminated by Kane. Over the following months, he wrestled primarily at house shows and on &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;. In March, Albert formed a faction with Justin Credible and X-Pac called X-Factor. The group feuded with the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray, D-Von and Spike), defeating them in a six-man tag team match at Backlash. On the June 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Albert defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, following assistance by Diamond Dallas Page to win the Intercontinental Championship, his first and only title in the WWF. During this time, Credible left X-Factor and joined The Alliance. Albert held the Intercontinental Championship for a month, retaining the title against The Undertaker, Edge, Rhyno, former X-Factor teammate Justin Credible, and Tommy Dreamer. At Invasion, Albert represented WWF by teaming with Billy Gunn and Big Show against Alliance&#x27;s Chris Kanyon, Hugh Morrus and Shawn Stasiak in a losing effort. The following night, Albert lost the Intercontinental Championship to Alliance member Lance Storm on the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, after several wrestlers interfered. Following the title loss, Albert and X-Pac continued X-Factor as a tag team until November, when X-Pac was sidelined with an injury.

Albert would then begin teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty after defeating him in a match on the November 4 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;. On the November 10 episode of &quot;Jakked&quot;, Albert and Scotty teamed for the first time and defeated Alliance members Raven and Hugh Morrus, turning Albert into a fan favorite. Albert was nicknamed &quot;The Hip Hop Hippo&quot; as he danced with Scotty after matches and became a comical character. At Survivor Series, Albert participated in a battle royal, with the winner getting immunity from being fired regardless of the result of the match between WWF and Alliance. Albert was eliminated by Billy Kidman and Test. At Vengeance, Zoo Crew defeated Christian and Test. On the December 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Albert and Scotty&#x27;s team was named Zoo Crew as they teamed with Tazz to defeat Christian and Dudley Boyz in a six-man tag team match. On the December 17 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Zoo Crew unsuccessfully challenged Dudley Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship.

On January 20, 2002, Albert participated in the 2002 Royal Rumble match as the #17 entrant. He was eliminated by Christian and Chuck. On the January 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Zoo Crew unsuccessfully challenged Spike Dudley and Tazz for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At No Way Out, Zoo Crew participated in a tag team turmoil match to determine the #1 contenders for the Tag Team Championship. The APA won the match. In March, the WWF roster was divided into two brands, and both Albert and Scotty were assigned to the SmackDown! brand. They disbanded on the April 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when Albert attacked Scotty after the duo failed to defeat Billy and Chuck for the WWF Tag Team Championship, turning Albert into a villain. Albert defeated Scotty on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Albert then moved to singles competition, mainly competing on &quot;Velocity&quot; for the next several months. During that time, Albert made a pay-per-view appearance at Rebellion, where he lost to Rikishi in a Kiss My Ass match.

==== A-Train (2002–2004) ====

Albert competed in his first match on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; since July, on the December 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by defeating Rey Mysterio in a short match. Albert continued to attack Mysterio after the match, until Mysterio&#x27;s tag team partner Edge made the save. The following week, on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Albert joined forces with Paul Heyman and Big Show, which saw Heyman persuade him to rename himself to A-Train and debut new attire, the latter of which saw fans often chant &quot;Shave Your Back!&quot; at him during his matches due to his hairy torso. Following the name change, A-Train continued his rivalry with Edge, losing to him via disqualification after a chair shot at Armageddon. On the December 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, A-Train and Edge had a rematch, which A-Train decisively lost via pinfall.

On January 19, 2003, A-Train participated in the 2003 Royal Rumble as the #25 entrant. He was eliminated by Kane and Rob Van Dam. A-Train would then continue his alliance with Big Show as they lost to The Undertaker in a handicap match at WrestleMania XIX, after assistance by The Undertaker&#x27;s originally supposed partner Nathan Jones, who was attacked earlier in the show. A-Train continued the feud with The Undertaker by costing him a match against John Cena on the August 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. This culminated in a match between A-Train and The Undertaker at SummerSlam, which A-Train lost. A-Train then lost to Chris Benoit at No Mercy and, at Survivor Series, was on Brock Lesnar&#x27;s team in a ten-man Survivor Series match in a losing effort to Kurt Angle&#x27;s team, in which he was pinned by Bradshaw. On the January 22, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, A-Train defeated Shannon Moore to qualify for the 2004 Royal Rumble match, which he failed to win after being eliminated by the eventual winner, Chris Benoit. After Benoit decided to wrestle Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship on the Raw brand, General Manager Paul Heyman held a SmackDown! brand-exclusive Royal Rumble on the January 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, to determine who would meet Lesnar for the WWE Championship at No Way Out. A-Train was eliminated by the eventual winner Eddie Guerrero.

A-Train was traded to the Raw brand on March 22 before making his official Raw debut on June 7, losing to Chris Jericho. His last match was a loss to Val Venis on &quot;Heat&quot;. Two weeks later, he was sidelined with a torn rotator cuff and was released from his WWE contract on November 1, before he could return.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2005–2006) ===

In March 2005, Bloom began wrestling for the Japanese All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion, adopting the ring name &quot;Giant Bernard&quot; (a reference to wrestler Brute Bernard). He went on to join the Voodoo Murders stable alongside fellow WWE alumni Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli. On October 18, 2005, Bloom unsuccessfully challenged Satoshi Kojima for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling ===

==== Various feuds (2006–2009) ====
In January 2006, Bloom left AJPW and joined the rival New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion. In April 2006, he defeated Yuji Nagata in the finals of the 2006 New Japan Cup. As a result of his victory, Bloom received a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He unsuccessfully challenged IWGP Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar on May 3, 2006, in Tenjin, Chūō-ku, Fukuoka.

In July 2006, following the abdication of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship by Lesnar, Bloom entered a tournament for the title, losing to Hiroshi Tanahashi in the tournament final. In August 2006, Bloom took part in the 2006 G1 Climax Tournament, losing to Hiroyoshi Tenzan in the semifinals.

On March 11, 2007, in Nagoya, Bloom and Travis Tomko defeated Manabu Nakanishi and Takao Omori to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. At the February 17, 2008, New Japan show, they lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Togi Makabe and Toru Yano. Following Tomko&#x27;s departure for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on a full-time basis, Bernard began teaming with former World Championship Wrestling wrestler Rick Fuller in another powerhouse tag team. On September 5, 2008, Bernard and Fuller betrayed Shinsuke Nakamura and Hirooki Goto to align themselves with Togi Makabe&#x27;s Great Bash Heel stable.

In addition to wrestling for NJPW, Bloom also wrestled for their affiliate Wrestle Land as Rusher Road, where he was a member of the Roads stable until the brand&#x27;s closure.

==== Bad Intentions (2009–2012) ====
In 2009, after betraying Togi Makabe, Bernard and the rest of GBH left the stable to join Shinsuke Nakamura and form the new stable known as CHAOS. Bernard formed the tag team Bad Intentions with CHAOS partner Karl Anderson and together the two of them went on to win that year&#x27;s G1 Tag League after defeating Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi) in the finals of the tournament on November 1. They went on to challenge for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but their match with the defending champions Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) at Destruction &#x27;09 ended in a double countout. In April 2010, both Bernard and Anderson left CHAOS when the stable turned on them.

Through NJPW&#x27;s working agreement with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, Bloom did his first tour of Mexico in May 2010, where he and Anderson managed to win six successive Two-out-of-Three Falls tag team matches in two straight falls, before he lost his final match of the tour on June 11 via disqualification. Upon his return to Japan, Bernard and Anderson defeated the teams of Seigigun (Yuji Nagata and Wataru Inoue) and No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro Takahashi) in a Three-Way Elimination match on June 19 at Dominion 6.19 to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Bad Intentions made their first successful defense of the IWGP Tag Team Championship on July 19, defeating Seigigun and No Limit in a three-way &quot;Dogfight&quot;. In late October, Bad Intentions entered the 2010 G1 Tag League, where, after three wins and two losses, they finished second in their block. This put them in the semifinals where, on November 7, they were defeated by eventual winners Yuji Nagata and Wataru Inoue. On January 4, 2011, at Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, Bad Intentions successfully defended the IWGP Tag Team Championship in a three-way match against Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) and Muscle Orchestra (Manabu Nakanishi and Strong Man). On May 3, Bad Intentions defeated No Limit to make their seventh successful IWGP Tag Team Championship defense, tying the record for most defenses, set by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono.

Bad Intentions made their record-breaking eighth successful IWGP Tag Team Championship defense on June 18 at Dominion 6.18 against Pro Wrestling Noah&#x27;s Takuma Sano and Yoshihiro Takayama, and in the process also became the new GHC Tag Team Champions upon defeating Sano and Takayama for the title. After the main event of the show, Bernard challenged Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which Tanahashi said he would accept, if Bad Intentions beat him in a match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, alongside the man he just defeated - Hirooki Goto. On July 3, Bernard and Anderson successfully defended the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Tanahashi and Goto. By winning, Bernard earned an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match against Tanahashi on July 18, but failed.

On July 23, Bad Intentions made an appearance for Pro Wrestling Noah, making their first successful defense of the GHC Tag Team Championship against the team of Takeshi Morishima and Yutaka Yoshie. On September 9, Bad Intentions became the longest reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions, breaking the previous record of 446 days set by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono in 2003. Bad Intentions made their second GHC Tag Team Championship defense on October 31, defeating Go Shiozaki and Shuhei Taniguchi at a Pro Wrestling Noah event. During New Japan&#x27;s 2011 G1 Tag League, Bad Intentions suffered their first tag team loss in a year, when they were defeated by the Complete Players (Masato Tanaka and Yujiro Takahashi), but still managed to win their four other matches and advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On November 6, after defeating the Billion Powers (Hirooki Goto and Hiroshi Tanahashi) in the semifinals, Bad Intentions were defeated in the final of the 2011 G1 Climax by Suzuki-gun (Minoru Suzuki and Lance Archer). On November 12 at Power Struggle, Bad Intentions made their tenth successful IWGP Tag Team Championship defense against Archer and Suzuki.

On January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Bad Intentions lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima), ending their record-setting reign at 564 days. They followed suit with their other title on January 22, losing the GHC Tag Team Championship to Akitoshi Saito and Jun Akiyama.

=== Return to WWE (2012–present) ===

==== Lord Tensai (2012–2013) ====

On March 17, 2012, it was reported that Bloom had re-signed with WWE. Bloom publicly denied the signing; however, on the March 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he appeared in a vignette under the new ring name &quot;Lord Tensai&quot; (天災). On the April 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bloom made his WWE re-debut as Lord Tensai, where he was accompanied by his follower Sakamoto before defeating Alex Riley. In the following weeks, Tensai went on a winning streak, scoring pinfall victories over lower card wrestlers and even main stars including John Cena and WWE Champion CM Punk.
On the May 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Tensai dropped the &quot;Lord&quot; portion of his ring name and his Japanese outfit worn during his entrance. Following this, Tensai began losing much more frequently throughout the rest of 2012, beginning with John Cena ending his winning streak before he also suffered a loss to World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus. His losing streak caused Tensai to often vent his frustrations by abusing and attacking Sakamoto, who eventually ceased appearing with Tensai. On the June 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Tensai defeated Justin Gabriel to break his losing streak and also qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank, though the match was ultimately won by Dolph Ziggler. Over the next three months, Tensai&#x27;s losing streak resumed, as he lost to the likes of Tyson Kidd, Sin Cara, Randy Orton, and Ryback. Tensai finally ended his losing streak on the October 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, defeating Big Show by disqualification after Sheamus interfered. However, he would be back on the losing end the following week, after being defeated by Sheamus. On November 18 at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, Tensai took part in a traditional Five-on-Five Elimination tag team match, but he was the second man eliminated from his team, but not before eliminating Brodus Clay. In December, Tensai was demoted to a comedy act, with Santino Marella calling him &quot;Fat Albert&quot; before proceeding to defeat Tensai.

====Tons of Funk (2013–2014)====
On the January 28, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Tensai was tricked into wearing lingerie while participating in a dance-off with Brodus Clay. Two days later on &quot;Main Event&quot;, after being mocked for his lingerie dance, Tensai defeated Titus O&#x27;Neil in a singles match. Clay came out to support Tensai during the match and Tensai danced with Clay after the match, signalling a face turn. Following this, Clay and Tensai formed a tag team and they went on to defeat established teams such as Primo and Epico, Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal of 3MB, and Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow), with the latter match taking place during the pre-show of Elimination Chamber on February 17. On the March 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Tensai and Clay were defeated by Team Rhodes Scholars in a tag team match after an interference from their associates The Bella Twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SmackDown3/22/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tensai (also now referred to by the name Sweet T) and Clay announced their official tag-team name &quot;Tons of Funk&quot; on the March 27 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot;, where they accompanied The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi) to the ring in a losing effort to The Bella Twins with Team Rhodes Scholars in their corner when Nikki pinned Naomi after an interference by Cody Rhodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainEvent3/27/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The two teams were originally booked to face each other in an eight-person mixed tag team match on April 7 at WrestleMania 29, but their match was cut due to time constraints. The match instead took place the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, where Tons of Funk and The Funkadactyls emerged victorious. After nearly a month of in-ring absence, Tons of Funk returned on the June 6 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, defeating Primo and Epico. On June 24, Tensai and Clay competed in a Triple Threat tag team match to determine the number one contenders for the Tag Team Championship against The Usos and 3MB (represented by Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal), although The Usos would ultimately win the match. In November 2013, Tons of Funk began to show signs of instability once Clay started a storyline where he became angry and jealous of the debuting Xavier Woods. As Clay began to exhibit more heel-oriented tendencies, such as repeatedly attacking Woods after he had defeated Woods in a match, Tensai and the Funkadactyls slowly became alienated from him. At , Clay faced Woods&#x27; partner, R-Truth, and continually assaulted Truth instead of going for a win, resulting in Tensai and the Funkadactyls leaving in protest and Clay subsequently losing the match. On the December 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Tensai defeated Clay in a singles match after a distraction from Woods and the Funkadactyls.

====Retirement and trainer (2014–present)====
After Tons of Funk disbanded, Bloom was taken off television and, in January 2014, began working in WWE&#x27;s developmental territory NXT as a commentator under the new ring name &quot;Jason Albert&quot;. On August 7, Bloom stated he decided to retire from in-ring competition and announced that he would begin working as a trainer in the WWE Performance Center, resuming his teaching profession. On March 6, 2015, Bloom was reportedly promoted to interim NXT head trainer following the departure of Bill DeMott. On May 19, Bloom was promoted to NXT head coach from his previous interim role.
