<text>The romanization of Korean is the use of the Latin script to transcribe the Korean language.

There are multiple romanization systems in common use. The two most prominent systems are McCune–Reischauer (MR) and Revised Romanization (RR). MR is almost universally used in academic Korean studies, and a variant of it has been the official system of North Korea since 1992. RR is the official system of South Korea and has been in use since 2000.

The earliest romanization systems for Korean emerged around the mid-19th century. Due to a number of factors, including the properties of the Korean language and alphabet, as well as social and geopolitical issues, a single settled standard did not emerge. By 1934, there were 27 extant romanization systems, and by 1997, there were over 40.

==Major systems==

The following systems are currently the most widely used:
* McCune–Reischauer (&quot;MR&quot;; 1939): Basis for various romanization systems. Almost universally used by international academic journals on Korean studies. Modified version used for South Korea from 1984 to 2000. 
** Romanization of Korean (1992): The official romanization in North Korea, with some differences from standard MR.
** The ALA-LC / U.S. Library of Congress system is based on but deviates from MR. Unlike in MR, it addresses word division in seven pages of detail. Syllables of given names are always separated with a hyphen, which is expressly never done by MR. Sound changes are ignored more often than in MR.
*Revised Romanization of Korean (&quot;RR&quot;; 2000): South Korea&#x27;s official romanization system.
* Yale romanization of Korean (1942): Standard for almost exclusively international linguists.

== History ==
Possibly the earliest romanization system was an 1832 system by German doctor Philipp Franz von Siebold, who was living in Japan. Another early romanization system was an 1835 unnamed and unpublished system by missionary Walter Henry Medhurst that was used in his translation of a book on the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. Medhurst&#x27;s romanization scheme was otherwise not significantly used. In 1874, the Dallet system was introduced; it was based around French-language phonology. It was the first to use the digraphs &quot;eo&quot; and &quot;eu&quot;, and the first to use diacritics for Korean romanization; it used the grave and acute accents over the letter &quot;e&quot;. The first system to see significant usage was the Ross system, named for John Ross, which was designed in 1882. It saw adoption by missionaries.

In 1897, James Scarth Gale introduced his system in his work &quot;A Korean-English Dictionary&quot;. This system went on to achieve some adoption; it was reportedly adopted by the &quot;Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies&quot;. In spite of this, some scholars found issues with these early systems. More systems by Westerners emerged, based on English, French, and German phonology. Japanese scholars also developed their own romanizations for Korean, many of which were built on the work of Siebold and Dallet. In 1933, the first romanization system developed by Koreans, which was appended to the Unified Han&#x27;gŭl Orthography System, was promulgated by the Korean Language Society. In 1935, published &quot;The International Phonetic Transcription of Korean Speech Sounds&quot;.

Systems continued to be developed to address various perceived shortcomings in other systems. By 1934, according to Japanese linguist Shinpei Ogura&#x27;s count, there were at least 27 extant systems. Whereas Hepburn romanization had already become the widely accepted standard for the romanization of Japanese by the 1930s, Korean continued to lack such a standard. This led to significant diversity and inconsistencies in romanizations, not only between scholars but reportedly even within the writings of individual authors.

=== Challenges for developing a standard romanization ===
The task of developing a standard romanization scheme for Korean was complicated by a number of factors.

Even into the 20th century, there were significant variations in pronunciation and spelling in the Korean language itself, often due to the dialects of Korean. Attempts were made to standardize the Korean language, but these efforts were made by multiple authorities. Two rivaling societies for standardizing Korean emerged: the Korean Language Society () and the Chŏson Ŏhak Yŏn&#x27;guhoe (); they published separate guidances. Eventually, the Korean Language Society&#x27;s standard became the basis for the standards of both North and South Korea. Other references for spelling included those used in Gale&#x27;s dictionary, guidances from the Government-General of Chōsen, and a French dictionary.

Other challenges were fundamental to properties of the Korean language and script, which make the language not easily mappable onto the Latin script. McCune and Reischauer claimed in 1939 that there are eight to ten vowels in Korean (this topic was still debated by that point). As there are only five vowels in the Latin script, the other vowel sounds had to be rendered either using multiple letters in the form of digraphs (e.g. &quot;eo&quot; for ) or by using diacritics. Also, in many cases, pronunciation does not exactly match what is written in Hangul; similar phenomena occurs with all other major scripts as well. For example, due to linguistic assimilation, the state Silla is written in Korean as (), but pronounced .

Some challenges were social and geopolitical. Reportedly, early scholars often wrote about Korea from Sinocentric or Japanese perspectives; Korean place names were often rendered using pronunciations from the Chinese or Japanese languages. Furthermore, after Korea went under Japanese rule, the &quot;official&quot; names of many places were considered to be those in the Japanese language. In addition, the Japanese colonial government implemented various restrictions on the use of the Korean language around the mid-1930s; the Korean Language Society was also persecuted in one incident.

Regardless of romanization systems, many Koreans chose and continue to choose to spell their names in Latin script in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; manner. For example, 이/리 (李) is variously romanized as &quot;Lee&quot;, &quot;Yi&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;Rhee&quot;. In some cases, single families romanized their surnames differently on South Korean passports. For example, within a single family, a father&#x27;s surname was rendered as &quot;Shim&quot; and the son&#x27;s as &quot;Sim&quot;.

=== McCune–Reischauer ===

McCune–Reischauer (MR) is a system that was first introduced in 1939, in the journal &quot;Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch&quot;. It is named for George M. McCune and Edwin O. Reischauer; the two developed the system together in consultation with Korean linguists Choe Hyeon-bae, , and .

=== After the liberation and division of Korea ===
With 1945 came the liberation of Korea, as well as its division. Both Koreas began to develop separate language standards. Just after the 1950–1953 Korean War, romanization was reportedly seen as a minor concern, compared to improving domestic literacy in Hangul. Meanwhile, romanization systems continued to emerge; by 1997, there were more than 40 romanization systems.

In 1956, North Korea became the first of the two Koreas to promulgate an official romanization system. This system combines features of the Dallet and 1933 Unified systems. It was revised in 1986.

In 1959, the published a romanization system, which has since been dubbed the Ministry of Education system (MOE). It reportedly quickly proved to be controversial, especially amongst non-Koreans. Fouser evaluated the system as prioritizing use for Koreans; it had a one-to-one correspondence from Hangul to Latin script, and did not account for the pronunciation changes that Hangul itself did not reflect. The system also tended to produce romanizations that bore superficial resemblance to words in English, some of which were seen as odd or humorous.

Eventually, the South Korean government began reevaluating the use of the system in anticipation of the 1988 Summer Olympics, which were to be held in Seoul. In 1984, a slightly revised version of McCune–Reischauer was adopted. Some South Koreans reportedly had negative reactions to the system, which they viewed as confusing and overly beholden to pronunciation.

In 1968, Samuel E. Martin introduced a system that has since been dubbed the Yale system. The system became widely adopted by the international academic linguistics community, although few others adopted it. Fouser argues that while the system allowed for reversibility, it is &quot;unsightly&quot;, is suited to those who already know Hangul, and does not adequately communicate pronunciation, even in comparison to the MOE system.

==== Computer age ====
With the spread of computers and the Internet by the 1980s and 1990s, complaints about MR reportedly grew. The breves used in MR were not easily accessible on a standard keyboard. Some took to replacing the breve with alternate characters or simply omitting it altogether; the diversity of practice and ambiguity if breves were not used led to confusion. In 1986, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requested both North and South Korea to work together on developing a standard romanization. The two countries held a series of meetings, during which they failed to reach a consensus.

In 1991, the South Korean National Academy of the Korean Language (NAKL; ) proposed its own new system. Concurrently, Bok Moon Kim produced . A large debate reportedly emerged, with more systems being proposed and some proposing reverting to previous systems.

=== Revised Romanization of Korean ===

On July 7, 2000, the NAKL and Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that South Korea would adopt a new system: Revised Romanization (RR). Road signs and textbooks were required to follow these rules as soon as possible, at a cost estimated by the government to be at least US$500–600 million.

=== Kholodovich romanization ===
In the 1920s and 1930s various languages of the Soviet Union were switched to the Latin alphabet and it was planned that the language of Koreans of the Far East would be one of them. Hanja was deemed too hard to learn, while Hangul was claimed to be inconvenient for typesetting and handwriting. Since removal of Hanja would result in much ambiguity, it was proposed that Chinese words would be replaced by words of Korean origin (compare linguistic purism in Korean). The new alphabet, made by famous Koreanist , who would later make a system of transcribing Korean words into Russian, looked like this:

Lowercase ʙ was commonly used in Soviet Roman-derived alphabets due to some alphabets having a letter similar to b with a different purpose. The usage of only lowercase letters was also not unusual, as it was the Latin alphabet of Adyghe language, for example.

Some words written in the Soviet Latin alphabet: gu lli, nongdhion haggio, nong ʙ, zængsan, gugga diaʙondiyi.

The alphabet faced criticism from Koreans and was never put into use.

<doc id="333398" wikidata="Q1481398" url="?curid=333398" title="Henipavirus">
<text>Henipavirus is a genus of negative-strand RNA viruses in the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;, order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; containing six established species, and numerous others still under study. Henipaviruses are naturally harboured by several species of small mammals, notably pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes), microbats of several species, and shrews. Henipaviruses are characterised by long genomes and a wide host range. Their recent emergence as zoonotic pathogens capable of causing illness and death in domestic animals and humans is a cause of concern.

In 2009, RNA sequences of three novel viruses in phylogenetic relationship to known henipaviruses were detected in African straw-colored fruit bats (&quot;Eidolon helvum&quot;) in Ghana. The finding of these novel henipaviruses outside Australia and Asia indicates that the region of potential endemicity of henipaviruses may be worldwide. These African henipaviruses are slowly being characterised.

&quot;Nipah&quot; and &quot;Hendra henipaviruses&quot; are both considered category C (USDA-HHS overlap) select agents.

==Structure==
Henipavirions are pleomorphic (variably shaped), ranging in size from 40 to 600 nm in diameter. They possess a lipid membrane overlying a shell of viral matrix protein. At the core is a single helical strand of genomic RNA tightly bound to N (nucleocapsid) protein and associated with the L (large) and P (phosphoprotein) proteins, which provide RNA polymerase activity during replication.

Embedded within the lipid membrane are spikes of F (fusion) protein trimers and G (attachment) protein tetramers. The function of the G protein (except in the case of MojV-G) is to attach the virus to the surface of a host cell via Ephrin B1, B2, or B3, a family of highly conserved mammalian proteins. The structure of the attachment glycoprotein has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The F protein fuses the viral membrane with the host cell membrane, releasing the virion contents into the cell. It also causes infected cells to fuse with neighbouring cells to form large, multinucleated syncytia.

==Genome==

As all mononegaviral genomes, Hendra virus and Nipah virus genomes are non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA. Both genomes are 18.2 kb in length and contain six genes corresponding to six structural proteins.

In common with other members of the &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; family, the number of nucleotides in the henipavirus genome is a multiple of six, consistent with what is known as the &#x27;rule of six&#x27;. Deviation from the rule of six, through mutation or incomplete genome synthesis, leads to inefficient viral replication, probably due to structural constraints imposed by the binding between the RNA and the N protein.

Three additional protein products are produced from the henipavirus P gene: V, W, and C. The V and W proteins are generated through an unusual process called RNA editing. This specific process in henipaviruses involves the insertion of extra guanosine residues into the P gene mRNA prior to translation. The addition of a single guanosine results in production of V, and the addition of two guanosines residues produces W. The C protein is not produced through RNA editing but instead by leaky scanning of the host cell ribosome during translation of viral mRNA. P, V, and W possess an alternate open reading frame which results in production of C. P, V, W, and C are known to disrupt the host innate antiviral immune response through several different mechanisms. P, V, and W contain STAT1 binding domains, and act as interferon antagonists by sequestering STAT1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The C protein controls the early pro-inflammatory response and is also known to promote the viral budding process via a ESCRT-dependent pathway.

Cell receptor ephrin-B2, which is located on epithelial cells around smaller arteries, neurons, and smooth muscle cells, is targeted by the viral protein G. Once the protein G binds to ephrin-B2, the viral protein F facilitates fusion with the host cell membrane and releases viral RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. Upon entry, transcription of viral mRNA takes place using the viral RNA as a template. This process is started and stopped by the polymerase complex. Viral proteins are gathering in the cell as transcription occurs until the polymerase complex stops transcription and starts genome replication. Transcription of the viral RNA makes positive sense strands of RNA, which are then used as templates to make more negative sense viral RNA . Genome replication is halted before the viral particles can assemble to make a virion. Once the cell membrane is ready, new virions exit the host cell through budding.

== Vaccine ==
Henipaviruses have high mortality rates in mammalian hosts, both human and animal. Because of this, there is a need for immunization against HeV and NiV. The World Health Organization has classified henipaviral agents as R&amp;D Blueprint Priority Pathogens, indicating that they pose a significant risk due to their epidemic potential. The broad species tropism of NiV and HeV have resulted in mortality in livestock species in addition to humans, and as a result veterinary vaccines are in various stages of development or licensure. EquiVac HeV, a veterinary vaccine for horses was licensed in Australia in 2012. A number of experimental vaccines designed for humans are in preclinical development, but none have yet been licensed. A soluble HeV attachment glycoprotein vaccine designed to protect against NiV completed a phase I clinical trial in November 2022, but results have not yet been published.

The primary mechanism of protection against NiV and HeV induced by vaccination is thought to be neutralizing antibodies. However, a number of preclinical vaccine studies in animal models of disease have identified that the cell-mediated immune response including CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells may play a role in protection.

==Causes of emergence==
The emergence of henipaviruses parallels the emergence of other zoonotic viruses in recent decades. SARS coronavirus, Australian bat lyssavirus, Menangle virus, Marburg virus, COVID 19 and possibly Ebola viruses are also harboured by bats, and are capable of infecting a variety of other species. The emergence of each of these viruses has been linked to an increase in contact between bats and humans, sometimes involving an intermediate domestic animal host. The increased contact is driven both by human encroachment into the bats&#x27; territory (in the case of Nipah, specifically pigpens in said territory) and by movement of bats towards human populations due to changes in food distribution and loss of habitat.

There is evidence that habitat loss for flying foxes, both in South Asia and Australia (particularly along the east coast) as well as encroachment of human dwellings and agriculture into the remaining habitats, is creating greater overlap of human and flying fox distributions.

<text>The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight ( &quot;Al-rawḍ al-ʿāṭir fī nuzhaẗ al-ḫāṭir&quot;), also known as the Arabic Kama Sutra, is a fifteenth-century Arabic sex manual and work of erotic literature by Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nefzawi, also known simply as &quot;Nefzawi&quot;. It has been compared to the ancient Indian Kama Sutra. 

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive and gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about sexual health, and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the penis and vulva, has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.

== History ==
According to the introduction of Colville&#x27;s English translation, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; sometime during the fifteenth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi, was born in the south of present-day Tunisia. He compiled the present work at the request of the Hafsid ruler of Tunis, Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.

==Content of the book==
&quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; is composed of an introduction followed by 21 chapters. Neither the first French translator (an anonymous colonel who styled himself as &#x27;Monsieur le Baron R.&#x27;) nor Sir Richard Burton (who translated the text from the French version) give the 21st chapter. In these two translations, the book is about 100 pages long.

===Introduction===
The author praises God for having given us the pleasures of love-making. He says that God endowed women with beauty to inspire men to make love to them. He says that men have a natural weakness for the love of women. He says that he is a Muslim, that there is only one God and that Mohammed is his prophet. He says that he is the servant of God. He says that he wrote this book in Tunis for the Grand Vizir. He says that he had divided his work into different chapters to make it easier to read and understand.

===Chapter 1: The Man of Quality===
Nefzawi quotes a poem which describes what it is that women desire in a man. These things are described as &quot;youth, health, wealth, and not coming too fast&quot;. According to Nefzawi and the quoted poem, a man of high sexual quality has a large and vigorous shaft, possesses thick thighs and is not big bellied. Such a man should be quick to become erect in response to desire, yet slow to spend its passion by ejaculating. After orgasm, his penis is capable of becoming erect soon afterwards. His member is long enough to reach the end of his partner&#x27;s vagina and large enough to fill it.

Nefzawi suggests pleasant scents can excite women, and with that in mind, he regales the reader with a tale which illuminates the potency of scent in the sensual arts. He tells the story of a scurrilous man called Musaylima and his seduction of Sajah, two figures who are despised in Islamic history as false prophets. Musaylima attempted to fashion scriptures that might resemble the Qur&#x27;an and imitate the miracles of healing that occurred at the hands of the Prophet Muhammad, but woefully failed on both counts. According to the story that Nefzawi recounts, Musaylima and Sajah were disturbed that one another were competitors, and so agreed to meet at her invitation. Musaylima is said to have panicked, until he was advised by an old man of his tribe, who suggested that Musaylima set up &quot;a vaulted tent of coloured brocade&quot; in which silks and perfumed waters of &quot;lily, rose, carnation, violet&quot; were spread out, along with censers of &quot;Khymer aloes, ambergris and musk&quot;. The tent ropes were then loosened so the perfumes were not overpowering. When Sajah later meets with Musaylima, she is confused and loses her presence of mind in such an environment, whereupon Musaylima seduced her reciting a poem, asking her to lie on her back, or take it bending, squatting or on her hands and knees. Sajah finds his poetry and perfumes desirable and fornicates with him. After the story, the author describes the marriage of Musaylima and Sajah, the humiliating death and defeat of the false prophet Musaylima, and how Sajah later repented of her ways and became a true Muslim.

Nefzawi adds that a man worthy of praise is anxious to please women. He takes care of his appearance; he is truthful and sincere; he is brave and generous; he can be trusted; he is a good conversationalist. However, he does not boast about his relationship with other women.

To illustrate all this, the author tells the story of Bahloul, a buffoon who managed to make love to Hamdonna, the daughter of the King and the wife of the Grand Vizir. He first seduced her with his words. He then showed her his erected penis, which was strong and large. Upon doing this, she desired him and they made love. After they had climaxed, he kissed her lips and her breasts and then gave her cunnilingus. By that time, Bahloul was stiff again. They made love a second time; and then, when they had both climaxed, a third time.

===Chapter 2: The Woman of Quality===
A woman of high sexual quality, according to Nefzawi, has a perfect waist and is plump and lusty. She has black hair, large black eyes, an elegant nose, and vermilion lips. Her breath is of pleasant odour. Her breasts are full and firm. Her vulva does not emit a bad smell. Her hips are large. Her hands and her feet are of striking elegance.

Furthermore, she speaks and laughs rarely. Nefzawi adds that she never leaves the house and that she is not treacherous. If her husband shows his intention to make love, she complies with it. She assists him in his affairs. She does not complain or cry much. When her husband is downhearted, she shares his troubles. In public, she hides her secret parts and does not let anyone see them. She always dresses well and avoids showing her husband what might be repugnant to him.

At this point, the author tells the story of Dorerame, a slave who enjoyed making love with the most beautiful and well-born young women of his time, even if they belonged to other men. It is the longest story of &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;. We learn various things. For example, a woman says that a well-born lady could remain as long as six months without sex. We also learn that women can be very dangerous: he concludes this second chapter by saying that the moral of this tale is that &quot;a man who falls in love with a woman imperils himself, and exposes himself to the greatest troubles.&quot;

===Chapter 3: The Unattractive Man ===
Men who are misshapen, whose member is short, who do not make love with vigour or in a manner that gives women enjoyment, who skip foreplay, who are quick to discharge their sperm and leave their partner right after the ejaculation, are men who are held in contempt by women.

Men who lie, who cannot be trusted, who conceal to their wives what they have been doing, except their adulterous affairs, are also men worthy of contempt.

===Chapter 4: The Unattractive Woman ===
Ugly women are repulsive but also those who are overly raucous and have a loud laugh. A woman who is often seen joking and fooling around may be promiscuous. Also listed as disagreeable traits are revealing their husband&#x27;s secrets, delighting in other&#x27;s misfortune, pointing out other&#x27;s shortcomings, busy-bodies, shrews, talkers, gossips, the lazy, harridans, the hysteric, the nag and the pilfering slag.

===Chapter 5: Sexual Intercourse===
It is recommended that a man should not eat or drink too much before having sex and that foreplay is necessary in order to excite the woman. When finished the man should not rush to leave and should do so on his right hand side.

===Chapter 6: Sexual Technique===
This chapter provides instructions on foreplay, specifying that it should include cunnilingus. The importance of the woman&#x27;s enjoyment and climax are stressed, as are a number of steps to be taken to avoid injury or infection. Concerning sexual positions it is said that all are permissible (but Khawam&#x27;s translation adds the words &quot;except in her rear end,&quot; i.e., anal sex). Eleven positions are then listed, six with the woman on her back, one from behind, two with one or both on their sides, one over furniture and one hanging from a tree.

===Chapter 7: The Harmful Effects of Intercourse===
This chapter lists numerous ailments that can result from sex, including loss of sight, jaundice, sciatica, hernia, stones in the urinary tract and, that sex with old women is a deadly sure poison. It is recommended that sex is enjoyed in moderation as the worst diseases arise from sexual intercourse.

===Chapter 8: Names for the Penis===
More than 30 names are listed for the penis. There is then a long digression on dream interpretation.

===Chapter 9: Names for the Vulva===
Nearly 40 names are listed for the vulva. There is then a digression on dream interpretation. There follows the story of Ja&#x27;idi, a man who was laughed at by women but was still successful in bedding them.

===Chapter 10: The Members of Animals===
The names of animals&#x27; penises are listed, divided by hoofed beasts, cloven-hoofed beasts and clawed beasts. The behaviour of the lion is then discussed.

===Chapter 11: Women&#x27;s Tricks===
This chapter opens by saying that women are more cunning than the devil. Four stories are presented, each with a woman who lies and tricks a man in some way, each ending with a warning to men about women. One story features an instance of zoophilia, with a woman and a donkey.

===Chapter 12: Questions and Answers for Men and Women===
The story of Mu&#x27;abbira, a wise woman, who provides insight into the workings of women&#x27;s minds and desires, as well as again listing positive and negative traits for women.

===Chapter 13: The Causes and Stimulation of Sexual Desire===
A number of aphrodisiac recipes are presented.

===Chapter 14: Remarks on Female Sterility and Methods of Treatment===
This chapter speculates on likely causes of barrenness and proposes some cures. Possible causes include witches&#x27; spells and the actions of demons and jinn.

===Chapter 15: The Causes of Male Sterility===
This chapter deals with problems of male fertility. It is observed that failure to simultaneously orgasm can be a cause.

===Chapter 16: Ways to Provoke Miscarriage===
Recipes for abortion are listed.

===Chapter 17: Treatment for Three Types of Erection Problem===
This short chapter deals with failure to erect, failure to maintain an erection and premature ejaculation, with recipes for cures for each.

===Chapter 18: How to Enlarge and Expand the Smaller Penis===
This chapter opens by saying it will be of interest to women and men, because women do not like a small or limp penis.

===Chapter 19: How to Remove Underarm and Vaginal Odour and Tighten the Vagina===
Recipes are listed to treat each condition.

===Chapter 20: The Symptoms of Pregnancy and How to Determine the Sex of the Unborn Child===
Listed are signs of first, pregnancy, then whether the baby will be male, then if it will be female (those for male are more positive than those for female).

===Chapter 21: The Benefits of Eggs and Sexually Stimulating Beverages===
This chapter opens with recommendations for various foods to enhance stamina. There is then the story of Abu&#x27;l Hayja, Abu&#x27;l Hayloukh and Maymoun, noting that it is a celebrated story of debauchery but far-fetched and fantastic. It features a woman thought to be a lesbian (because she had not been interested in one of the men) and ends with a set of sexual challenges – one man must deflower eighty virgins without ejaculating, one must have sex with a woman for fifty days, without going limp, another must stand in front of the women and maintain an erection for thirty days and nights. The fourth man must fetch them what they want. They complete the sexual challenges and take the palace as reward. The volume then concludes with a recipe for a sexually stimulating beverage, but notes that it should not be consumed in summer.

==Translations==

===1886: Burton English translation===
&quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir Richard Francis Burton. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of Aretin and Rabelais, and the French book &quot;Conjugal Love&quot; by Nicolas Venette but what Burton believes makes &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; unique in the genre is &quot;the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented.&quot; Burton points out that not all of the ideas in &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; are original: &quot;For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book &quot;Birds and Flowers&quot; by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams.&quot;

The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript&#x27;s last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled &quot;The Scented Garden&quot;, was never published as Burton&#x27;s wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.

=== 1976: Khawam French translation ===
A new French translation by René R. Khawam was published in 1976.

=== 1999: Colville English translation ===
In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English &quot;Perfumed Garden&quot; translated directly from the Arabic original. Of the Burton translation, he says, &quot;details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources. The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation. The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original&quot;.

Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled &quot;Sexual Technique&quot; in Colville&#x27;s translation and &quot;Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition&quot; in Burton&#x27;s. Burton&#x27;s translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these. Colville&#x27;s translation is 2½ pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.

==Inspiration for musical works==
In 1923 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote &quot;Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo&quot;.

RAH Band released a single entitled “Perfumed Garden” in 1982.

Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish melodic death metal band, also wrote a song called &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;, released on their &quot;Spirits and August Light&quot; album in 2003.

Ray Manzarek, inspired by this, recorded a track called &quot;Perfumed Garden&quot; for his solo album &quot;The Whole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It&#x27;s Out Of Control&quot;.

<doc id="333404" wikidata="Q551904" url="?curid=333404" title="Su Tseng-chang">
<text>Su Tseng-chang (; born 28 July 1948) is a Taiwanese politician who served as premier of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2019 to 2023. He was the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party in 2005 and from 2012 to 2014. Su served as Chief of Staff to President Chen Shui-bian in 2004. He is currently the longest-serving Democratic Progressive premier in history.

Su actively campaigned for the DPP presidential nomination in 2008, but finished second to Frank Hsieh. Su eventually teamed with Hsieh as the vice presidential nominee; the DPP lost to the Kuomintang ticket of Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew. Su ran for Taipei City Mayor in November 2010, but lost to the incumbent Hau Lung-pin by a 12-point margin. Su campaigned for the 2012 presidential candidacy of the DPP in 2011, but lost to Tsai Ing-wen by a very narrow margin. Following the loss of Tsai to Ma Ying-jeou, Su was elected to succeed Tsai as DPP chairman in 2012.

During the Chen administration, Su, along with politicians Annette Lu, Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun, are collectively known as the &quot;Big Four of the Democratic Progressive Party&quot;. Su is nicknamed the &quot;Lightbulb&quot; or &quot;E Ball&quot; () and &quot;Go Go Go&quot; (衝衝衝) by the Taiwanese media and DPP voters, a nickname he earned in the 1980s for his charismatic approach to campaigning during election season, in addition to being an affectionate reference to the balding Su.

==Early life and career==
Su was born at Ministry of Health and Welfare Pingtung Hospital in Pingtung, Taiwan, on 28 July 1948. He studied at the National Taiwan University. He was a practicing lawyer from 1973 to 1983 and became a defense lawyer in the Kaohsiung Incident trials. In September 1986, Su and seventeen others founded the Democratic Progressive Party.

He was previously the magistrate of Pingtung County (1989–1993) and magistrate of Taipei County (1997–2004). His first election as the Taipei magistrate was aided by a split between the New Party, the Kuomintang, and independent candidate Lin Chih-chia. He won the election in dramatic fashion partly due to the appearance of the terminally ill Lu Hsiu-yi, who kneeled on stage in support of Su on the eve of the election. Su&#x27;s subsequent reelection occurred by a wide margin despite the ability of the Pan-Blue Coalition to present a united candidate, Wang Chien-shien. He was Secretary-General (Chief of Staff) to the Office of the President of the Republic of China under President Chen Shui-bian (2004–2005). After President Chen resigned as DPP chairman following the 2004 legislative elections, he was elected the 10th-term DPP chairman. Following DPP losses in the 2005 municipal elections on December 3, Su announced that he would, pursuant to a pre-election promise, resign from the chairmanship.

==First premiership: 2006–2007==
Su was announced as the new premier on January 19, 2006, and took his oath of office, along with his cabinet, on January 25, 2006. Soon after, Su promised to step down if the people&#x27;s welfare (referring to crime and other civil problems) did not improve within six months. Su faced calls for his resignation after the Rebar Chinese Bank run, but refused to leave his post at the time.

Su was a contender for the DPP nomination in the 2008 presidential election. He formally announced his candidacy on Feb. 25. In the DPP primary vote on May 6, 2007, Su received 46,994 votes, coming in second to former Premier Frank Hsieh. Conceding defeat in the primary, Su announced that he had withdrawn from the race.

On May 12, 2007, Su submitted his letter of resignation to President Chen Shui-bian, ending his tenure on May 21. With the resignation of Su and with ten months left in Chen&#x27;s presidency, that would mean Chen&#x27;s eight years as president will have seen at least six Premiers (with Chang Chun-Hsiung serving two separate tenures). Su also stated that he previously submitted resignations numerous times over his sixteen-month tenure, but all were rejected by President Chen.

=== First cabinet ===

== 2008 presidential campaign ==
Su ran for vice president alongside Frank Hsieh, who was the DPP nominee. Together, Su and Hsieh ran against Ma and Siew. On March 22, they lost in a landslide to Ma and Siew&#x27;s 7,659,014 (58.45%) votes with their 5,444,949 (41.55%) votes.

== 2010 Taipei mayoral race ==
Although Su had been considered a strong candidate to helm the newly created New Taipei City, because he had previously served the area as Taipei County Magistrate, he instead ran for the mayoralty of Taipei City. Su vowed that should he win, he would serve out the entire term (through 2014) effectively ending any talks of a presidential run in 2012. Su eventually lost the race to the incumbent mayor Hau Lung-pin.

== 2012 campaigns ==
Su declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential candidacy, but lost a DPP party primary held in April 2011 to Tsai Ing-wen and Hsu Hsin-liang, by a margin of 1.35 percent. He was subsequently elected DPP chairman in May 2012, and was succeeded by Tsai in 2014, after dropping out of the chairmanship election in the wake of the Sunflower Student Movement.

== 2018 New Taipei mayoral race ==

Total voters: 3,264,128; Valid votes: 2,038,822; Voter turnout: 62.46%.

==Second premiership: 2019–2023==
Su was appointed to the premiership on January 14, 2019, by President Tsai Ing-wen. He succeeded William Lai, who had resigned in response to the Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s poor performance in the 2018 Taiwanese local elections. Aged 71, when he returned to the premiership, Su became one of the oldest to hold the office. Soon after Su assumed office, approval ratings for Tsai&#x27;s presidential administration rose. Su and his second cabinet resigned en masse following the 2020 Taiwanese legislative election, as stipulated in the constitution, but Tsai, who won reelection to the presidency, asked him to remain in his post.

Su visited the crash site of the Hualien train derailment.

On November 5, 2021, Su was sanctioned by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for &quot;fanning up hostility across the Taiwan Strait and maliciously smearing the mainland&quot;.

On January 19, 2023, Su announced his resignation as Premier as part of a reshuffle following the DPP&#x27;s heavy defeat in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections. On January 30, Su and his cabinet resigned en masse again. He was replaced by former Vice-President Chen Chien-jen the following day, on January 31.

=== Second cabinet ===

==Personal life==
Su is married to Chan Hsiu-ling (詹秀齡) with whom he has three daughters, one of which is Su Chiao-hui. Su goes by the name “Hope” in his LINE profile.

<doc id="333414" wikidata="Q38105" url="?curid=333414" title="Jämthund">
<text>The Jämthund, also called the Swedish Elkhound, is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is found in Northern Europe. The Jämthund is eponymous with Jämtland, a province in the middle of Sweden.

==History==
The Jämthund is one of a number of breeds of spitz-type hunting dogs that have been known throughout Scandinavia for centuries. Historically these dogs have been used to hunt a wide variety of game including bear, elk, wolf and lynx.

The Jämthund received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindström and others. Before that, both it and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed. They are both used for hunting large game, such as moose and bear.

===Lineage===
The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a male dog-female wolf hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 that is thought to have originated &quot;no more than 480–3,000 years ago&quot; and it includes all Sámi-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Swedish Elkhound, Norwegian Elkhound, Black Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).

==Description==
===Appearance===
The dog should have a loosely curled tail that hangs on the back and is not too thin or too tightly curled; when relaxed the tail should hang straight down. This breed has erect ears with a wide space in between them, a medium to long muzzle, and a double coat of various shades of agouti. The eyes are brown. The size of the male is usually , weighing . Females are usually between , weighing .

The Jämthund should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound. The Norwegian Elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Jämthund, and its tail shape is very different. It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Jämthund has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings.

===Temperament===
Although calm and affectionate with its family, the Jämthund can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive. A truly all-around canine, it can go from a hunting trip and back to the family hearth with great aplomb. It takes things in stride and does not get ruffled easily, making it a steady partner in the field or at home.

The Jämthund is a happy learner who loves to please its owner.

<doc id="333416" wikidata="Q6861774" url="?curid=333416" title="Milwaukee Mustangs (1994–2001)">
<text>The Milwaukee Mustangs were a professional arena football team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The team was a member of the Arena Football League, playing from 1994 to 2001. The owner of the Mustangs was Andrew Vallozzi. The Mustangs played their home games at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==History==
===Expansion===
The team was founded in August 1993, when Andrew Vallozzi was approved by the league for expansion. The city of Milwaukee became football hungry, after renovations to Lambeau Field led to speculation that the Green Bay Packers would soon stop playing games in Milwaukee, something they&#x27;d been doing since 1933. Later that year, the Packers would confirm the rumors and announced that their December 1994 contest at Milwaukee County Stadium would be their last.

For many in the Milwaukee area, the Mustangs helped fill the void left by the Packers. The team never finished lower than eighth in seasonal attendance, regularly drawing in the 14,000&#x27;s and 15,000&#x27;s (at a time when average attendance was approx. 8,500). The Mustangs even led the AFL in attendance in 1996.

===Ending===
After the 2001 season, the Mustangs lost their lease at the Bradley Center. When it was unable to find a replacement facility, the league folded the team. Milwaukee was left without an arena football team until 2008, with the formation of the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League, who played their home games at the U.S. Cellular Arena. A year later, the Milwaukee Iron began play in the Arena Football 2 League across the street at the Bradley Center. In January 2011, it was announced that the Milwaukee Iron, now of the Arena Football League would be changing its name to the Milwaukee Mustangs.

In 2018, the Milwaukee Mustangs&#x27; intellectual properties were acquired by Counterbalance Sports &amp; Entertainment, LLC, the sports-entertainment division of Counterbalance Group Inc. Additionally, Counterbalance Sports began using the Milwaukee Iron / [Second] Milwaukee Mustangs branding in 2021.

<text>Archimedes&#x27; principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. Archimedes&#x27; principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse.

==Explanation==

In &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;, Archimedes suggested that (c. 246 BC):

Archimedes&#x27; principle allows the buoyancy of any floating object partially or fully immersed in a fluid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes&#x27; principle above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant—that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes&#x27; principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body(s).

==Formula==

Consider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, its top and bottom faces orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube&#x27;s stretch). The fluid will exert a normal force on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The pressure difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid—the buoyancy—equaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid. By summing up sufficiently many arbitrarily small cuboids this reasoning may be extended to irregular shapes, and so, whatever the shape of the submerged body, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. 
:formula_1

The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force (Fb) on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density (ρ) of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume (V) times the gravity (g)

We can express this relation in the equation:
:formula_2
where formula_3 denotes the buoyant force applied onto the submerged object, formula_4 denotes the density of the fluid, formula_5 represents the volume of the displaced fluid and formula_6 is the acceleration due to gravity.
Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy.

Suppose a rock&#x27;s weight is measured as 10 newtons when suspended by a string in a vacuum with gravity acting on it. Suppose that, when the rock is lowered into the water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyant force: 10 − 3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea-floor. It is generally easier to lift an object through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.

For a fully submerged object, Archimedes&#x27; principle can be reformulated as follows:
:formula_7

then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume

:formula_8

yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volume is

:formula_9

(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a dasymeter and of hydrostatic weighing.)

Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.

Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. When increasing speed or driving in a curve, the air moves in the opposite direction to the car&#x27;s acceleration. However, due to buoyancy, the balloon is pushed &quot;out of the way&quot; by the air and will drift in the same direction as the car&#x27;s acceleration.

When an object is immersed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force, which is known as the buoyant force, that is proportional to the weight of the displaced liquid. The sum force acting on the object, then, is equal to the difference between the weight of the object (&#x27;down&#x27; force) and the weight of displaced liquid (&#x27;up&#x27; force). Equilibrium, or neutral buoyancy, is achieved when these two weights (and thus forces) are equal.

== Forces and equilibrium ==
The equation to calculate the pressure inside a fluid in equilibrium is:

: formula_10

where f is the force density exerted by some outer field on the fluid, and &quot;σ&quot; is the Cauchy stress tensor. In this case the stress tensor is proportional to the identity tensor:

: formula_11

Here &quot;δij&quot; is the Kronecker delta. Using this the above equation becomes:

: formula_12

Assuming the outer force field is conservative, that is it can be written as the negative gradient of some scalar valued function:

: formula_13

Then:

: formula_14

Therefore, the shape of the open surface of a fluid equals the equipotential plane of the applied outer conservative force field. Let the &quot;z&quot;-axis point downward. In this case the field is gravity, so Φ = −&quot;ρfgz&quot; where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, &quot;ρf&quot; is the mass density of the fluid. Taking the pressure as zero at the surface, where &quot;z&quot; is zero, the constant will be zero, so the pressure inside the fluid, when it is subject to gravity, is

: formula_15

So pressure increases with depth below the surface of a liquid, as &quot;z&quot; denotes the distance from the surface of the liquid into it. Any object with a non-zero vertical depth will have different pressures on its top and bottom, with the pressure on the bottom being greater. This difference in pressure causes the upward buoyancy force.

The buoyancy force exerted on a body can now be calculated easily, since the internal pressure of the fluid is known. The force exerted on the body can be calculated by integrating the stress tensor over the surface of the body which is in contact with the fluid:

: formula_16

The surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral with the help of the Gauss theorem:

: formula_17

where &quot;V&quot; is the measure of the volume in contact with the fluid, that is the volume of the submerged part of the body, since the fluid doesn&#x27;t exert force on the part of the body which is outside of it.

The magnitude of buoyancy force may be appreciated a bit more from the following argument. Consider any object of arbitrary shape and volume &quot;V&quot; surrounded by a liquid. The force the liquid exerts on an object within the liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid with a volume equal to that of the object. This force is applied in a direction opposite to gravitational force, that is of magnitude:

: formula_18

where &quot;ρf&quot; is the density of the fluid, &quot;Vdisp&quot; is the volume of the displaced body of liquid, and &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration at the location in question.

If this volume of liquid is replaced by a solid body of exactly the same shape, the force the liquid exerts on it must be exactly the same as above. In other words, the &quot;buoyancy force&quot; on a submerged body is directed in the opposite direction to gravity and is equal in magnitude to

: formula_19

The net force on the object must be zero if it is to be a situation of fluid statics such that Archimedes principle is applicable, and is thus the sum of the buoyancy force and the object&#x27;s weight

: formula_20

If the buoyancy of an (unrestrained and unpowered) object exceeds its weight, it tends to rise. An object whose weight exceeds its buoyancy tends to sink. Calculation of the upwards force on a submerged object during its accelerating period cannot be done by the Archimedes principle alone; it is necessary to consider dynamics of an object involving buoyancy. Once it fully sinks to the floor of the fluid or rises to the surface and settles, Archimedes principle can be applied alone. For a floating object, only the submerged volume displaces water. For a sunken object, the entire volume displaces water, and there will be an additional force of reaction from the solid floor.

In order for Archimedes&#x27; principle to be used alone, the object in question must be in equilibrium (the sum of the forces on the object must be zero), therefore;

: formula_21

and therefore

: formula_22

showing that the depth to which a floating object will sink, and the volume of fluid it will displace, is independent of the gravitational field regardless of geographic location.

: (&quot;Note: If the fluid in question is seawater, it will not have the same density (&quot;ρ&quot;) at every location. For this reason, a ship may display a Plimsoll line.)&quot;

It can be the case that forces other than just buoyancy and gravity come into play. This is the case if the object is restrained or if the object sinks to the solid floor. An object which tends to float requires a tension restraint force T in order to remain fully submerged. An object which tends to sink will eventually have a normal force of constraint N exerted upon it by the solid floor. The constraint force can be tension in a spring scale measuring its weight in the fluid, and is how apparent weight is defined.

If the object would otherwise float, the tension to restrain it fully submerged is:

: formula_23

When a sinking object settles on the solid floor, it experiences a normal force of:

: formula_24

Another possible formula for calculating buoyancy of an object is by finding the apparent weight of that particular object in the air (calculated in Newtons), and apparent weight of that object in the water (in Newtons). To find the force of buoyancy acting on the object when in air, using this particular information, this formula applies:

: Buoyancy force = weight of object in empty space − weight of object immersed in fluid

The final result would be measured in Newtons.

Air&#x27;s density is very small compared to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam).

=== Simplified model ===

A simplified explanation for the integration of the pressure over the contact area may be stated as follows:

Consider a cube immersed in a fluid with the upper surface horizontal.

The sides are identical in area, and have the same depth distribution, therefore they also have the same pressure distribution, and consequently the same total force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, exerted perpendicular to the plane of the surface of each side.

There are two pairs of opposing sides, therefore the resultant horizontal forces balance in both orthogonal directions, and the resultant force is zero.

The upward force on the cube is the pressure on the bottom surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal bottom surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the bottom surface.

Similarly, the downward force on the cube is the pressure on the top surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal top surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the top surface.

As this is a cube, the top and bottom surfaces are identical in shape and area, and the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the cube is directly proportional to the depth difference, and the resultant force difference is exactly equal to the weight of the fluid that would occupy the volume of the cube in its absence.

This means that the resultant upward force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid that would fit into the volume of the cube, and the downward force on the cube is its weight, in the absence of external forces.

This analogy is valid for variations in the size of the cube.

If two cubes are placed alongside each other with a face of each in contact, the pressures and resultant forces on the sides or parts thereof in contact are balanced and may be disregarded, as the contact surfaces are equal in shape, size and pressure distribution, therefore the buoyancy of two cubes in contact is the sum of the buoyancies of each cube. This analogy can be extended to an arbitrary number of cubes.

An object of any shape can be approximated as a group of cubes in contact with each other, and as the size of the cube is decreased, the precision of the approximation increases. The limiting case for infinitely small cubes is the exact equivalence.

Angled surfaces do not nullify the analogy as the resultant force can be split into orthogonal components and each dealt with in the same way.

==Refinements==

Archimedes&#x27; principle does not consider the surface tension (capillarity) acting on the body. Moreover, Archimedes&#x27; principle has been found to break down in complex fluids.

There is an exception to Archimedes&#x27; principle known as the bottom (or side) case. This occurs when a side of the object is touching the bottom (or side) of the vessel it is submerged in, and no liquid seeps in along that side. In this case, the net force has been found to be different from Archimedes&#x27; principle, as, since no fluid seeps in on that side, the symmetry of pressure is broken.

==Principle of flotation==
Archimedes&#x27; principle shows the buoyant force and displacement of fluid. However, the concept of Archimedes&#x27; principle can be applied when considering why objects float. Proposition 5 of Archimedes&#x27; treatise &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot; states that
In other words, for an object floating on a liquid surface (like a boat) or floating submerged in a fluid (like a submarine in water or dirigible in air) the weight of the displaced liquid equals the weight of the object. Thus, only in the special case of floating does the buoyant force acting on an object equal the objects weight. Consider a 1-ton block of solid iron. As iron is nearly eight times as dense as water, it displaces only 1/8 ton of water when submerged, which is not enough to keep it afloat. Suppose the same iron block is reshaped into a bowl. It still weighs 1 ton, but when it is put in water, it displaces a greater volume of water than when it was a block. The deeper the iron bowl is immersed, the more water it displaces, and the greater the buoyant force acting on it. When the buoyant force equals 1 ton, it will sink no farther.

When any boat displaces a weight of water equal to its own weight, it floats. This is often called the &quot;principle of flotation&quot;: A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to displace a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship&#x27;s hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to displace 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water to prevent it from sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to displace 100 tons of air. If it displaces more, it rises; if it displaces less, it falls. If the dirigible displaces exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.

While they are related to it, the principle of flotation and the concept that a submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume are &quot;not&quot; Archimedes&#x27; principle. Archimedes&#x27; principle, as stated above, equates the &quot;buoyant force&quot; to the weight of the fluid displaced.

One common point of confusion regarding Archimedes&#x27; principle is the meaning of displaced volume. Common demonstrations involve measuring the rise in water level when an object floats on the surface in order to calculate the displaced water. This measurement approach fails with a buoyant submerged object because the rise in the water level is directly related to the volume of the object and not the mass (except if the effective density of the object equals exactly the fluid density).

==Eureka==

Archimedes reportedly exclaimed &quot;Eureka&quot; after he realized how to detect whether a crown is made of impure gold. While he did not use Archimedes&#x27; principle in the widespread tale and used displaced water only for measuring the volume of the crown, there is an alternative approach using the principle: Balance the crown and pure gold on a scale in the air and then put the scale into water. According to Archimedes&#x27; principle, if the density of the crown differs from the density of pure gold, the scale will get out of balance under water.

<doc id="333425" wikidata="Q1824016" url="?curid=333425" title="Count of Flanders">
<text>The count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. Later, the title would be held for a time, by the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain. During the French Revolution, in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of Belgian kings. The most recent holder died in 1983.

In 862 Baldwin I was appointed as the first Margrave of Flanders by King Charles II. It was a military appointment, responsible for repelling the Viking raids from the coast of Francia. The title of margrave (or marquis) evolved into that of count. Arnulf I was the first to name himself as count, by the Grace of God. The title of margrave largely fell out of use by the 12th century. Since then, the rulers of Flanders have only been referred to as counts.

The counts of Flanders enlarged their estate through a series of diplomatic marriages. The counties of Hainaut, Namur, Béthune, Nevers, Auxerre, Rethel, Burgundy, and Artois were all acquired in this manner. However, the County of Flanders suffered the same fate in turn. As a result of the marriage of Countess Margaret III with Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, the county and the subsidiary counties entered a personal union with the Duchy of Burgundy in 1405.

The counts of Flanders were also associated with the Duchy of Brittany prior to its union with France. In , Joan, the daughter of Arthur II, Duke of Brittany, married the second son of Count Robert III. Joanna of Flanders, the granddaughter of Count Robert III and daughter of his son, Count Louis I, married John Montfort. During Montfort&#x27;s imprisonment, she fought on his behalf, alongside English allies, during the Breton War of Succession for the ducal crown, which was won definitively by her son John V, Duke of Brittany. It was through this alliance that the Duchy of Brittany was eventually joined to the throne of France.

When the Habsburg empire was divided among the heirs of Charles V, the Low Countries, including Flanders, went to Philip II of Spain, of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.

=== House of Bourbon ===
Between 1706 and 1714, Flanders was invaded by the English and the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. The fief was claimed by the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon. In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht settled the succession and the County of Flanders went to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg.

=== House of Habsburg ===
The title was abolished &quot;de facto&quot; after revolutionary France annexed Flanders in 1795. Emperor Francis II relinquished his claim to the Low Countries in the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797, and the area remained part of France until the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Modern usage==
===House of Belgium (formerly House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) ===
In modern times, the title was granted to two younger sons of the kings of the Belgians.

* Prince Philippe, son of King Leopold I of Belgium (1840–1905)
* Prince Charles, son of King Albert I of Belgium (1910–1983)

=== House of Bourbon ===
The title Count of Flanders is one of the titles of the Spanish Crown. It is a historical title which is only nominally and ceremonially used.

<doc id="333429" wikidata="Q1995480" url="?curid=333429" title="Minor civil division">
<text>A minor civil division (MCD) is a term used by the United States Census Bureau for primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of a county or county-equivalent, typically a municipal government such as a city, town, or civil township. MCDs are used for statistical purposes by the Census Bureau, and do not necessarily represent the primary form of local government. They range from non-governing geographical survey areas to municipalities with weak or strong powers of self-government. Some states with large unincorporated areas give substantial powers to counties; others have smaller or larger incorporated entities with governmental powers that are smaller than the MCD level chosen by the Census.

As of 2010, MCDs exist in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In all other states where state-defined entities are not used for census purposes (mostly in the South and the West), the Census Bureau designates Census County Divisions (CCDs). For several decennial censuses prior to the 2010 census, 28 states used MCDs, but in 2008, Tennessee changed from CCDs to MCDs, bringing the total number of MCD states to 29.

In states that use MCDs, when any land or water is not covered by a state-defined MCD, the Census Bureau creates additional entities as unorganized territories, that it treats as equivalent to MCDs for statistical purposes. Because MCDs are used to divide up counties, when a MCD-level municipality or unallocated territory or water spans county boundaries, that entity&#x27;s boundaries are used to create multiple MCDs, one for each county. For water areas unallocated to any MCD, the Census Bureau assigns a default FIPS county subdivision code of 00000 and an ANSI code of eight zeroes. This typically happens when state and county boundaries extend into the ocean or Great Lakes, but MCDs are not defined by the state for the unoccupied water. (For the ocean boundary of state vs. federal responsibility, see Tidelands.)
==Minor civil divisions by state and territory==
* American Samoa - counties are treated as MCDs; districts and atolls are treated as county equivalents.
* - townships (non-governing), one unorganized territory (Fort Chaffee)
* Connecticut - towns and consolidated city-towns, unorganized water in Long Island Sound. Groton is the only city not consolidated with a town. Naugatuck is the only borough coterminous with a town.
* District of Columbia - considered an undivided equivalent of state, county, and MCD.
* Guam - villages (technically election districts, but these are currently all co-terminous). Some reports treat villages as county equivalents.
* Illinois - townships in 85 counties, election precincts in 17 counties, unorganized water in Lake Michigan. Chicago spans two counties and is thus two separate MCDs.
* Indiana - townships, one unorganized territory (Camp Atterbury), unorganized water in Lake Michigan
* Iowa - townships, cities, one unorganized water area (reservoir in Polk County). The city of Tabor spans two counties and constitutes two MCDs.
* Kansas - cities, townships (some non-governing)
* Louisiana - parish governing authority districts (non-governing, used for elections), one city (New Orleans)
* Maine - cities, towns, plantation, American Indian reservations, unorganized territories (including one gore)
* Maryland - county election districts, one city (Baltimore)
* Massachusetts - cities, towns, unorganized water
* Michigan - townships, cities, unorganized water
* Minnesota - townships (mostly governing), cities, unorganized territories, unorganized water
* Mississippi - supervisors&#x27; districts (five per county, only used for electing county officials)
* Missouri - townships (mostly non-governing), one city (St. Louis)
* Nebraska - townships (27 counties, mostly governing), election precincts (65 counties), election districts (Webster County), cities, villages
* New Hampshire - cities, towns, unincorporated townships (some of which are known as grants, locations, or purchases), unorganized water
* New Jersey - cities, towns, boroughs, villages, townships (governing), unorganized water
* New York - cities, towns, American Indian reservations, unorganized territory, unorganized water. Each of the boroughs of New York City is a county. The city of Geneva also spans county boundaries; the only part in Seneca County is water.
* North Carolina - townships (non-governing), one city (Asheville), four unorganized territories, and Cleveland County is undivided after abolishing townships
* North Dakota - townships (mostly governing), cities, unorganized territories
* Northern Mariana Islands - municipal districts; municipalities are treated as county equivalents
* Ohio - townships, cities, villages
* Pennsylvania - townships (governing except for Cold Spring Township), boroughs, cities, 3 municipalities, 1 town, and 1 area of unorganized water
* Puerto Rico - barrios and barrios-pueblo, unorganized water
* Rhode Island - towns, cities, unorganized water
* Tennessee - county commissioner districts (non-governing)
* South Dakota - cities, townships, unorganized territories
* Vermont - cities, towns (governing except 5 unincorporated), and four gores (one of which is known as Warner&#x27;s Grant)
* Virginia - independent cities (each of which is also a county equivalent), districts (used for election of county supervisors, known as magisterial districts or election districts); Arlington County is a single MCD
* US Virgin Islands - subdistricts (created by the territorial government explicitly for census purposes)
* West Virginia - magisterial districts (used to elect county commissioners and school board members)
* Wisconsin - towns (mostly governing, consolidated with county in Menominee County), cities, villages, unorganized water

The United States also performs a census for the Republic of Palau, which has an agreement of free association. The U.S. Census considers all of Palau a county equivalent, and uses its states (formerly known as municipalities) as MCDs.

<doc id="333431" wikidata="Q333256" url="?curid=333431" title="Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster">
<text>Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, (13 October 1825 – 22 December 1899), styled Viscount Belgrave between 1831 and 1845, Earl Grosvenor between 1845 and 1869, and known as The Marquess of Westminster between 1869 and 1874, was an English landowner, politician and racehorse owner. He inherited the estate of Eaton Hall in Cheshire and land in Mayfair and Belgravia, London, and spent much of his fortune in developing these properties. Although he was an MP from the age of 22, and then a member of the House of Lords, his main interests were not in politics, but rather in his estates, in horse racing, and in country pursuits. He developed the stud at Eaton Hall and achieved success in racing his horses, who won the Derby on four occasions.

==Personal life==
Hugh Lupus Grosvenor was born at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, the second and eldest surviving son of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster and Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, the younger daughter of George Leveson-Gower, the 2nd Marquess of Stafford and later the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He was educated at Eton College and, until 1847, at Balliol College, Oxford. He left Oxford without taking a degree to become Member of Parliament (MP) for Chester. This seat, a family borough, had been held by his uncle Robert Grosvenor (later the 1st Baron Ebury), who decided to move to one of the two unopposed Middlesex seats. In 1851, he toured India and Ceylon.

The following year, on 28 April 1852, Grosvenor married his first cousin, the 17-year-old Lady Constance Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the fourth daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. The wedding was held in the Chapel Royal in St. James&#x27;s Palace, London, and was attended by Queen Victoria and Albert. Constance&#x27;s mother had been Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria and a &quot;favourite&quot; of the queen. Their first child, a son, was born in 1853, and Queen Victoria became his godmother. By 1874, the couple had eleven children, eight of whom survived into adulthood; five sons and three daughters.

In 1880, Constance died from Bright&#x27;s disease (nephritis). Two years later, in June 1882, Grosvenor married Katherine Cavendish, third daughter of the 2nd Baron Chesham and Henrietta Frances Lascelles. She was then aged 24; she was younger than the duke&#x27;s eldest son and two of his daughters. They had four children, two sons and two daughters. The succession to the dukedom (and estates) was destined to devolve upon the sons born of this second marriage, because although the first marriage had produced five sons who grew to adulthood, none of them produced heirs.

==Political and public life==

Grosvenor was elected as Whig MP for Chester in 1847 and continued to represent that constituency until, on the death of his father in 1869, he succeeded as 3rd Marquess of Westminster and entered the House of Lords. His maiden speech in the Commons was made in 1851 in a debate on disorders in Ceylon, shortly following his tour of the country. Otherwise he took little interest in the affairs of the House of Commons until 1866 when he expressed his opposition to Gladstone&#x27;s Reform Bill. This played a part in Gladstone&#x27;s resignation, the election of the Conservative Derby government and Disraeli&#x27;s Second Reform Act. The relationship between Grosvenor and Gladstone later improved and in Gladstone&#x27;s resignation honours in 1874, Grosvenor was created the 1st Duke of Westminster. When Gladstone became Prime Minister again in 1880, he appointed Grosvenor as Master of the Horse, a position appropriate to his interests in horse racing but &quot;not an actively political office&quot;. In the 1880s Grosvenor disagreed with Gladstone again, this time about Home Rule for Ireland. During this dispute, Grosvenor sold his portrait of Gladstone that had been painted by Millais. Ten years later they were again reconciled when they both opposed atrocities by the Turks against the Armenians. When Gladstone died in 1898, Grosvenor presided over a Gladstone National Memorial committee that commissioned statues of him, and rebuilt Gladstone&#x27;s St Deiniol&#x27;s Library at Hawarden in north Wales.

In 1860 Grosvenor formed the Queen&#x27;s Westminster Rifle Volunteers and became its lieutenant colonel and honorary colonel in 1881. He led the Cheshire Yeomanry as Colonel Commandant from 1869. He also supported charities; at one time or another, he was the president of five London hospitals, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, the Gardeners&#x27; Royal Beneficent Association, the Hampstead Heath Protection Society, the Early Closing Association, the United Committee for the Demoralization of Native Races by the Liquor Traffic, and the Royal Agricultural Society. He was a member of the Council for the Promotion of Cremation; at that time cremation was unpopular with the Church. Grosvenor was chairman of the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Nursing Fund, an organisation that provided district nurses for the sick poor, through which he became associated with Florence Nightingale. In 1883 he was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, and when the London County Council was created in 1888, he became the first Lord Lieutenant of the County of London.

==Development of the estates==
The seat of the Grosvenor country estate is at Eaton Hall in Cheshire. When Grosvenor inherited the estate, it was worth at least £152,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) a year. After inheriting the estate, one of his first acts was to commission a statue of his eponym, Norman Hugh Lupus, who had been the 1st Earl of Chester, from G. F. Watts, to stand in the forecourt of the hall.
In 1870, Grosvenor commissioned Alfred Waterhouse to design a new house to replace the previous hall designed by William Porden and extended by William Burn. The core of the previous hall was retained, parts were completely rebuilt and other parts were refaced and remodelled. A private wing was built as a residence for the family, connected to the main hall by a corridor. Waterhouse also designed Eaton Chapel and its associated clocktower and redesigned the stables. It is said that the hall&#x27;s guests &quot;were not greatly amused&quot; by the carillon of 28 bells that played 28 tunes and sounded every quarter of the hour during the day and night. The work took 12 years to complete and cost £803,000 (equivalent to £ as of ). The hall has been described as &quot;the most ambitious instance of Gothic Revival domestic architecture anywhere in the country&quot;, and as &quot;a vast, cheerless, Gothic structure&quot;.
Grosvenor paid for many buildings on his estates. He was a patron of the Chester architect John Douglas. Douglas&#x27; biographer, Edward Hubbard, estimated that the duke commissioned four churches and chapels, eight large houses, about 15 schools and institutions, about 50 farms (in whole or part), about 300 cottages, lodges, smithies and the like, two cheese factories, two inns, and about 12 commercial buildings (for most of which Douglas was the architect)—and these were just the buildings in the city of Chester and on the Eaton estate. He commissioned G. F. Bodley to rebuild St Mary&#x27;s Church in his Cheshire estate village of Eccleston, which was completed in 1899, the year of his death. He also spent money on Grosvenor House in London and Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, which he had inherited on the death of his mother-in-law. He built shooting lodges on sporting estates in Sutherland, in Scotland, that he rented from his cousin, the Duke of Sutherland.

The Grosvenor wealth came mainly from the ground rents of Mayfair and Belgravia in London; these grew from about £115,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) in 1870 to about £250,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) annually in 1899. He oversaw much rebuilding in Mayfair and commissioned architects—such as Norman Shaw, Aston Webb and Alfred Waterhouse—to design new buildings. He held his own opinions on architectural styles and decoration, favouring the Queen Anne style rather than the Italianate stucco preferred by his father; for red brick and terracotta; for stucco to be painted bright orange, and railings in chocolate or red; and for Oxford Street to be paved with wooden blocks. He opposed the use of telegraph poles and wires and would not allow any building work during the London season. He encouraged the provision of more urinals, both on his estates and in London generally, and has been described as a &quot;one-man planning and enforcement officer&quot;.

==Personality and personal interests==

Grosvenor&#x27;s major interest was in horse racing. In 1875, he established a racing stable at Eaton, eventually employing 30 grooms and boys, with two or three stallions and about 20 breeding mares. He regarded this, not so much as an extravagance, but rather as an aristocratic duty. He never gambled or placed a bet on any of his horses. In 1880, one of his horses, &quot;Bend Or&quot;, ridden by Fred Archer, won the Derby, and he had more Derby successes in 1882, 1886, and 1899. With his successes and sale of horses, it is considered possible that this enterprise was self-financing. Grosvenor took an interest in the country pursuits of deer stalking and shooting, both in the Scottish Highlands and on his Cheshire estate and added to the family&#x27;s art collection. Grosvenor was teetotal and a supporter of temperance. In his Mayfair estate he reduced the number of public houses and beerhouses from 47 to eight.

==Final years and death==
In 1899, the last year of his life, he supported the Seats for Shop Assistants Act (to reduce cruelty to women employees), stalked a stag in Scotland, shot 65 snipe in 1½ hours in Aldford on his Cheshire estate, and attended the wedding of one of his granddaughters, Constance Ashley-Cooper, Countess of Shaftesbury, in July. 

On 11 December, while visiting the same granddaughter at the Shaftesbury estate, St Giles House in Dorset, he developed bronchitis. He frequently suffered from bouts of bronchitis in the winters and was reported to be recovering, but on 20 December his condition took a grave turn. Members of his family were summoned to St Giles, where he died two days later.

He was cremated in Woking Crematorium and his ashes were buried in the churchyard of Eccleston Church, Cheshire. The 1st Duke of Westminster had two cenotaphs erected in his honour, one in the Grosvenor Chapel of Eccleston Church and another in the south transept of Chester Cathedral. Another memorial was a stained-glass window in the south transept of Westminster Abbey, dedicated by the Dean in September 1902.

He was succeeded as Duke of Westminster by his grandson, Hugh. At his death he was &quot;reputedly the wealthiest man in Britain&quot;; his estate for the purposes of probate was £594,229 (equivalent to £ million as of ), and his real estate (entailed therefore not included in his personal estate under the law of that time) was valued at about £6 million ().

==Family==

The Duke married twice and was the father of fifteen children, twelve of whom survived into adulthood. The difference in age between his eldest son Victor and his youngest son Edward was thirty-nine years.

The Duke&#x27;s first wife, whom he married in 1852, was his first cousin, Lady Constance Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the fourth daughter of his maternal uncle the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived into adulthood, being:

<text>King (2021 population 27,333) is a township in York Region north of Toronto, within the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada.

The rolling hills of the Oak Ridges Moraine are the most prominent visible geographical feature of King. The Holland Marsh, considered to be Ontario&#x27;s &quot;vegetable basket&quot;, straddles King Township and Bradford West Gwillimbury. King is known for its horse and cattle farms.

Though King is predominantly rural, most of its residents inhabit the communities of King City, Nobleton, and Schomberg.

==History==
Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe named King Township for John King (1759–1830), an English Under-Secretary of State for Home Office from 1794 to 1801 for the Home Department in the Portland administration when Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool was Secretary of State.

The township was created as part of the subdivision of York County, itself a subdivision of the Home District. The lands were originally acquired by the British in an agreement with the Mississaugas, known as the Toronto Purchase; it was enacted in British parliament as the Toronto Purchase Act in 1787. Acquisition of the lands for the townships of Etobicoke, King, Vaughan, and York, Upper Canada was completed at a meeting between the Mississaugas and the British at the Credit River on 1 August 1805, where were exchanged for £1,700.

Simcoe planned Yonge Street, which was built between 1793 and 1796 by the Queen&#x27;s Rangers. The first seven land patents were issued in 1797. By 1801, Timothy Rogers, a Loyalist from Vermont, had travelled the road and found an area on its western boundary immediately southwest of Newmarket very appealing. He applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of , and subsequently returned to Vermont to recruit families to operate those farms. By February 1802, he had set out for King Township with the first group of settlers for those forty farms. A second group followed later that month.

The area would become known as &quot;Armitage&quot;, in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage. It was the first of King&#x27;s settlements, and now part of Newmarket. Soon after the establishment of Armitage, the communities of Kettleby and Lloydtown were established to the west. More settlers arrived from New York, Pennsylvania, and other Loyalist enclaves over the subsequent years to populate the region, drawn by the abundant, fertile land being apportioned relatively cheaply to newcomers. A &quot;considerable area of land...in different concessions&quot; of King were patented to the Canada Company after its establishment in 1826.

By 1842, the township consisted of of land, of which had been cleared and was being cultivated. The principal villages at the time were Lloydtown, Brownsville (now Schomberg), Bogarttown (now a part of Newmarket), and Tyrwhitt&#x27;s Mills (now Kettleby).

In 1851, the township annexed from West Gwillimbury the portion of land north of its extant and east of the Holland River as a result of the formation of Simcoe County. Approximately of land were administered by the township in 1878, according to the &quot;Historical Atlas of York County&quot;, but by 1973 this had been reduced to 82,000; some of its land has been ceded to what are now known as Newmarket, Aurora and Oak Ridges.

The first survey of King Township was conducted in 1800 by Hessian soldier Johann Stegmann. At the time, the area&#x27;s population was twenty residents. According to a letter by Benjamin Cody to the Newmarket Era published on 7 May 1892, there were church records listing births in the area, and the first white child in King may have been Sarah Rogers, born April 1800. At least four children were born in King by July 1802. By 1809, the township&#x27;s population had increased sevenfold, to 160. It wasn&#x27;t until 1820, with the construction of roads into the township, that its population began to grow. By 1842, the population of 2,625 residents was principally Irish, and also included those of English, Scottish, Canadian, and American descent. Further surveys were conducted in 1836–1838 by Callighan, in 1852 by John Ryan, and completed in 1859 by Whelock. The townships population grew to 5574 in 1850, and nearly 8000 in 1875, after which it declined to 4588 in 1914.

There is some evidence of a large Huron encampment at Hackett Lake. Residents in the area in the 1950s and 1960s discovered arrowheads and other archaeological items indicating a Huron presence. This is consistent with the fact that the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, a major route used in the 17th and 18th centuries, passes through the township. The route was used by explorer Étienne Brûlé, who first travelled along the trail with twelve Huron guides in 1615.

Early settlements in the area developed primarily around gristmills and sawmills. These were important economic engines in the region during the 19th century, which resulted in the establishment of other communities and businesses nearby. By 1842, there were eight grist mills and 12 saw mills in King. Some settlements have since been abandoned, or are no longer communities per se, including &quot;Bell&#x27;s Lake&quot;, &quot;Davis Corners&quot;, and &quot;King Ridge&quot;.

In 1971, with the formation of the Regional Municipality of York and dissolution of York County, the township&#x27;s boundaries were changed, shifting west by one concession from Yonge Street to Bathurst Street, and north by one lot from the King-Vaughan town line.

In 2017, the township lent its name to the Barenaked Ladies song &quot;Township of King&quot;, written by band member Kevin Hearn. The lyrics allude to the construction of Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, which is actually located in the City of Vaughan, several kilometres south of the Township of King&#x27;s southern boundary.

==Geography==
The township&#x27;s boundaries are

* East: Bathurst Street
* South: a line north of the King-Vaughan Road
* West: the Caledon/King Townline, which connects two roads (Caledon/King Townline North and Caledon/King Townline South) in a roughly straight line
* North: Highway 9 from the Caledon/King Townline to slightly east of Highway 27, then cuts north following branches of the Holland River until it meets Bathurst Street

The majority of King is located on the Oak Ridges Moraine, which is the origin for the headwaters of many rivers throughout its extent, including the Humber River in King. Numerous interconnected provincially and regionally significant areas are located in the township. The most prominent are seven Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest, and the wetland complexes adjacent to or within those areas.

=== Climate ===
Slightly removed from the UHI of Toronto, the climate is warm-summer humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;).

==Local government==
King Township was incorporated in 1850 as The Corporation of the Township of King. Its current mayor is Steve Pelligrini, who was sworn into office in December 2010. The Town Council includes the mayor and six councillors representing the township&#x27;s six wards. The mayor is also a member of York Regional Council via double direct election.

===Budget===
The township draws revenues from various sources. The most significant in 2007 were municipal taxes (67.9% of revenue), fees and service charges (14.0%), water charges (4.3%), grants (3.5%) and reserves (2.9%). The most significant expenditures for 2007 were general municipal government (27.6%), recreation and culture (21.7%), transportation (17.8%), protection (16.6%) and environmental projects (11.6%).

The Township offices reside at the King City Plaza, a strip mall purchased by the municipal government in the 1990s which also has several business tenants. In 2013, the township purchased the disused former Holy Name Catholic Elementary School building and adjacent of land from the York Catholic District School Board for $2.95 million. In 2016, township planning staff announced that the school building would be redesigned for use as office space for the township, for community and non-profit groups, and to house a satellite office for the York Regional Police. In May 2016, the Police Services Board approved the King City substation and announced that a 20-year lease would be executed for use of about of space in the building. In June 2016, township staff announced the building would be destroyed in mid-2016 and replaced by a structure on the site at a cost of about $15 million. It will include a public-use gymnasium. The capital project will be partially financed by selling the strip mall.

===Provincial and federal politics===


As a result of the federal electoral redistribution of 2012, starting with the 2015 federal election the township is represented in the House of Commons by the Members of Parliament of the King—Vaughan and York—Simcoe electoral districts. The portion of King north of Highway 9 is part of the York—Simcoe electoral district, represented by Scot Davidson of the Conservative Party of Canada. The remaining areas are part of the King—Vaughan electoral district represented by Anna Roberts of the Conservative Party of Canada. Previously, King was part of the Oak Ridges—Markham, created for the 2004 election because of rapid growth in York Region, and before that in the Vaughan—King—Aurora electoral district.

The provincial riding of King—Vaughan is represented by Stephen Lecce, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. It was created as part of Ontario&#x27;s re-districting to match provincial electoral districts with their federal equivalents. King was part of the Oak Ridges—Markham electoral district from 2007 to 2018, the Vaughan—King—Aurora electoral district from 1999 to 2007, York—MacKenzie from 1995 to 1999, and York North from Confederation to 1995. The portion of King north of Highway 9 is part of the York—Simcoe electoral district, represented by Caroline Mulroney of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.

==Transportation==
The Township of King is located between Toronto and Barrie, stretching from Bathurst Street to just east of Highway 50. King is accessible by Highways 400, 27, 9 and 11.

Public transportation is provided by York Region Transit (bus service) and GO Transit (bus and train services), but their services are limited in the township due to low population density. King City GO Station is the only train station in the township. York Region Transit&#x27;s services are confined to the southeastern area, and GO bus serves the Nobleton and King City communities.

Most air travel is served by Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada&#x27;s largest airport, located south of the township in Mississauga. The township&#x27;s only airport, King City Airport, was a general aviation airfield that closed in the 1990s.

==Education==

Public schools with classes from kindergarten through grade twelve are administered by the York Region District School Board and the York Catholic District School Board. The only public secondary school in King, King City Secondary School, serves students residing in a relatively large geographic area, including some from adjacent towns. A private Catholic high school, St. Thomas of Villanova College, and private JK -12 school, The Country Day School, are also located in the township.

Seneca College owns a campus located in the southeastern portion of King Township, where the college offers various programs.

==Settlements==

King&#x27;s earliest settlement, Armitage, is now part of Newmarket. Its establishment was followed by those of Lloydtown and Kettleby. Subsequent settlements were founded near rivers, which provided the energy necessary to operate various mills. The earliest were based in Laskay, Kinghorn, and Eversley. The hamlet of Springhill was established later and flourished; it was renamed King City, now the largest community in the township.

*Eversley is a hamlet that, although it has its own historical development, has slowly been subsumed into King City. It lies on King City&#x27;s north-eastern edge, south of Snowball. It was also known as Tinline&#x27;s Corners in the 1800s.
*Glenville is a hamlet located in northeastern King, just south of the community of Ansnorveldt.
*Hammertown is a former hamlet located near the intersection of the 12th concession and 17th sideroad.
*Heritage Park is a community of King City. It is a natural and wildlife park characterized by ravines and creeks, some of which feed the East Humber River. Portions of the park are in the King City Trail.
*Kinghorn is a community of King City, located at the Jane Street-King Road intersection. It is a sparse residential area adjacent to Highway 400, and is home to the King Township Museum and The Kingbridge Centre.
*Laskay is a hamlet located just west of King City and south of the King Road—Weston Road intersection.
*Snowball is a growing hamlet located just north of Eversley, west of Aurora.

Other hamlets in King include Holly Park, Linton, and New Scotland.

==Heritage sites==
In the township, there are eleven sites designated &quot;Heritage Sites&quot;, including:

*King Station was built in 1852 along the Northern Railway to serve &quot;Springhill&quot; (now King City). It was moved in 1989 to the grounds of the King Township Museum. It is believed to be the oldest surviving railway station in Canada, and was designated a heritage site in 1990.
*King Emmanuel Baptist Church, formerly the &quot;King Christian Church&quot; until 1931, it was moved to the grounds of the King Township Museum in 1982, and designated a heritage site in 1992.
*King City Cemetery, established in 1886, was designated a heritage site in July 2007. 
*King City Cemetery Dead House built circa 1887 was designated a heritage site in 2001. It is an octagonal structure that was used to preserve the dead during the winter, during which grave-digging was not feasible. Octagonal dead houses were unique to the area bordering Yonge Street north of Toronto during the late 19th and early 20th century.
*Eversley Presbyterian Church, a stone structure built in 1848, demonstrates the Scottish influence common in the area&#x27;s early development. It was designated in 1876.
*Glenville Methodist Church, a small frame structure built in 1859, which remained operational until 1952. It was designated in 1983 as a township heritage site.
*King Christian Church Cemetery was the first burial grounds for Kettleby, built in 1850. It was designated a heritage site in 1986.
*Laskay Temperance Hall, built in 1859 by the Sons of Temperance. It had been operated by the &quot;Laskay Women&#x27;s Institute&quot; since 1910, and is now operated by the municipality. It was designated a Heritage Site in 1986.

==Public services==
The township&#x27;s municipal tax revenue is divided into three streams. One portion is combined with that from other municipalities for education purposes, a second portion is used to finance regional projects managed by York Region, and the last portion is used for local services.

The most significant cultural service provided via municipal funding is the King Township Public Library, which operates four branches in the township.

Waste management is provided through the region, and is co-ordinated with programs offered in other towns in York Region. Weekly green bin compost collection began in September 2007 to complement the weekly blue box collection of recyclable material; collection of all other waste was reduced to once every two weeks. Water and wastewater management is operated by the township, though these services are not available ubiquitously; some areas rely on well water and septic tanks.

<text>New Taipei City is a special municipality located in northern Taiwan. The city is home to an estimated population of 4,004,367 as of January 2023, making it the most populous city in Taiwan, and also the second largest special municipality by area, behind Kaohsiung. The top-level administrative divisions bordering New Taipei City are Keelung to the northeast, Yilan County to the southeast, and Taoyuan to the southwest, and it completely encloses the city of Taipei. Banqiao District is its municipal seat and biggest commercial area. 

Before the establishment of Spanish and Dutch outposts in Tamsui in 1626, the area of present-day New Taipei City was mostly inhabited by Taiwanese indigenous peoples, mainly the Ketagalan people. From the late Qing era, the port of Tamsui was opened up to foreign traders as one of the treaty ports after the Qing dynasty of China signed the Treaty of Tientsin in June 1858. By the 1890s, the port of Tamsui accounted for 63 percent of the overall trade for entire Taiwan, port towns in the middle course of Tamsui River had also developed into bustling business and transportation centers. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the entire area of New Taipei City was organized as part of the Taihoku Prefecture. After the Republic of China took control of Taiwan in 1945, the present-day New Taipei City was designated on 7 January 1946 as Taipei County in Taiwan Province, which was constituted from the former Taihoku Prefecture, but not including present-day divisions of Taipei City, Keelung and Yilan County, the latter which became detached from Taipei County on 10 October 1950. Its county status remained until 25 December 2010 when it was promoted to special municipal status and renamed as &quot;New Taipei City&quot;.

New Taipei City is a conurbation which was merged from numbers of regiopolis, suburban business districts or commuter towns to form one continuous urban area. Together with cities of Taipei and Keelung, New Taipei City constitutes most of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area which spans from the island&#x27;s northern coastline to the mountainous Xueshan Range, and encompasses the entire Taipei Basin within its boundaries. The city is well-connected to other major cities in proximity or other parts of the island by various public transports such as Metro services, high-speed rail and an airport line commuting to Taoyuan International Airport, a major hub airport in northern Taiwan. The Port of Taipei, an artificial international seaport, is situated in the northwestern coast of the city in Bali District.

==Name==
New Taipei City was formerly known as Taipei County before its promotion to special municipality status in 2010. 
The name of the new municipality (, literally &quot;New Northern City&quot;) was initially rendered in English as Xinbei City via pinyin romanization, but both candidates for the city&#x27;s first mayoral election opposed the name. Consequently, citing public opinion, the inaugural mayor, Eric Chu, requested and received approval from the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to render the name in English as New Taipei City. This rendering became official on 31 December 2010.

==History==
===Early history===
Archeological records show that New Taipei City had been inhabited since the Neolithic period, with artifacts dug in Bali District having shown remains as early as 7000 to 4700 BC. The region around New Taipei City area was once inhabited by Ketagalan plains aborigines, and evidence shows that the Atayal had inhabited Wulai District. The earliest recorded migration by people from mainland China dated back as early as 1620, when the local tribes were driven into the mountain areas. Over the years, many of the aborigines have assimilated into the general population.

===Qing dynasty===
During the Qing Dynasty rule of Taiwan, the Han Chinese people began to settle in the area now designated as New Taipei City in 1694 and the number of immigrants from mainland China had further increased. After decades of development and prosperity, Tamsui had become an international commercial port by 1850. British consulate and stores were established in the region, which helped promote the local tea business, resulting in massive tea leaf exports to Europe. In 1875, Shen Baozhen called for the establishment of Taipeh Prefecture. Fujian-Taiwan-Province was declared in 1887 and the present-day New Taipei City area fell under the jurisdiction of Taipeh Prefecture.

===Japanese rule===
In 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing dynasty to the Empire of Japan. During Japanese rule, the New Taipei City area was administered under Taihoku Prefecture together with modern-day Taipei, Keelung and Yilan County. Gold and other mineral deposits were discovered at Keelung Mountain, triggering a mining boom in the region. In October 1896, Japanese government divided the mining area around Keelung Mountain into two districts: an eastern district, designated as Kinkaseki, and a western district, designated as Kyūfun. Both districts are now parts of Ruifang District. They also issued regulations barring local Taiwanese mining companies from mining in the area, giving the mining rights to Japanese companies instead.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, from 25 December of the same year, the present New Taipei City area was administered as Taipei County with Banqiao City as the county seat. In July 1949, the size of Taipei County was reduced when Beitou and Shilin townships were put under the jurisdiction of the newly created Caoshan Administrative Bureau, which would later be renamed the Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. The southeastern part of Taipei County, became Yilan County on 10 October 1950, while Taipei City was detached from Taipei County from a provincial city to a special municipality on 1 July 1967. On 1 July 1968, the size of Taipei County was further reduced by when Jingmei, Muzha, Nangang and Neihu townships, along with Beitou and Shilin, were merged into Taipei City.

The county afterward had ten county-administered cities (Banqiao, Luzhou, Sanchong, Shulin, Tucheng, Xizhi, Xindian, Yonghe, Zhonghe); four urban townships (Ruifang, Sanxia, Tamsui, Yingge); and fifteen rural townships (Bali, Gongliao, Jinshan, Linkou, Pinglin, Pingxi, Sanzhi, Shenkeng, Shiding, Shimen, Shuangxi, Taishan, Wanli, Wugu, Wulai). It was further divided into 1,017 villages and 21,683 neighborhoods. In August 1992, due to the adjustment of the demarcation line between Taipei City and Taipei County around Neigou and Daking Creeks, the area of Taipei County was decreased by . On 25 December 2010, Taipei County was upgraded to a special municipality as New Taipei City consisting of 29 districts with the modern Banqiao District as the municipal seat.

<text>Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer, (9 October 186423 July 1927) was a British military officer in the Bengal Army and later the newly constituted British Indian Army. His military career began in the regular British Army, but he soon transferred to the presidency armies of India.

As a temporary brigadier-general, he was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar (in the province of Punjab). He has been called &quot;the Butcher of Amritsar&quot;, because of his order to fire on a large gathering of people. The official report stated that this resulted in the killing of at least 379 people and the injuring of over a thousand more. Some submissions to the official inquiry suggested a higher number of deaths. After the massacre, he served in the Third Anglo-Afghan war, where he lifted the siege at Thal and inflicted heavy casualties on Afghans.

Dyer later resigned. He was widely condemned for spearheading the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, both in Britain and India, but he became a celebrated hero among some with connections to the British Raj.

==Life and career==
Dyer was born on 9 October 1864 in Murree, in the Punjab province of British India, which is now in Pakistan. He was the son of Edward Dyer, a brewer of English heritage who managed the Murree Brewery, and Mary Passmore. He spent his childhood in Murree and Shimla and received his early education at the Lawrence College Ghora Gali, Murree and Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. From eleven he attended Midleton College in County Cork, Ireland, before briefly studying medicine, at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Dyer then decided to pursue a military career, and enrolled at the Royal Military College of Sandhurst, from where he graduated in August 1885. He was also fluent in a number of Indian languages as well as Persian.

Following his graduation, Dyer was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) as a lieutenant, and performed riot control duties in Belfast (1886) and served in the Third Burmese War (1886–87). He transferred to the Bengal Army, initially joining the Bengal Staff Corps as a lieutenant in 1887. He was attached to the 39th Bengal Infantry, later transferring to the 29th Punjabis. Dyer served in the latter in the Black Mountain campaign (1888), the Chitral Relief (1895) (promoted to captain in November 1896) and, after attending the Staff College, Camberley from 1896 to 1897, the Mahsud blockade (1901–02).

In 1901 he was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant general. In August 1903, Dyer was promoted to major, and served with the Landi Kotal Expedition (1908). He commanded the 25th Punjabis in India and Hong Kong and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in May 1910.

During the First World War (1914–18), he commanded the Seistan Force, for which he was mentioned in dispatches and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He was promoted colonel in March 1915, and was promoted to temporary brigadier general in February 1916, when he took command of a brigade, and again in March 1918. In 1919, about a month after the Jallianwala Bagh killing, Dyer served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. His brigade relieved the garrison of Thal, and inflicted heavy casualties on Afghans, for which he was again mentioned in dispatches. For a few months in 1919 he was posted to the 5th Brigade at Jamrud. He retired on 17 July 1920, retaining the rank of colonel.

In 1888 Dyer married Frances Anne Trevor Ommaney, the daughter of Edmund Piper Ommaney, on 4 April 1888, in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Jhansi, India. The first of their three children, Gladys, was born in Shimla, India, in 1889. They also had two sons, Ivon Reginald, born 1895 and Geoffrey Edward MacLeod, born 1896.

==Amritsar massacre==
===Background===
In 1919, the European population in Punjab feared the locals would overthrow British rule. A nationwide hartal (strike action), which was called on 30 March (later changed to 6 April) by Mahatma Gandhi, had turned violent in some areas. Authorities were also becoming concerned by displays of Hindu-Muslim unity. Michael O&#x27;Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport major agitators from the province. One of those targeted was Dr. Satyapal, a Hindu who had served with the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War. He advocated non-violent civil disobedience and was forbidden by the authorities to speak publicly. Another agitator was Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and also preached non-violence. The district magistrate, acting on orders from the Punjab government, had the two leaders arrested.

In protest at this action, demonstrators headed for the residence of Miles Irving, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar. The deputy commissioner had given orders that protestors were not to be allowed to pass into the civil lines (the civilian administrative area, effectively the &quot;British area&quot; of town). Army pickets fired on the crowd, killing at least eight protesters and wounding others. As a result, angry mobs formed, returning to Amritsar&#x27;s city centre, setting fire to government buildings and attacking Europeans in the city. Three British bank employees were beaten to death, and Miss Marcella Sherwood, who supervised the Mission Day School for Girls, was cycling around the city to close her schools when she was assaulted by a mob in a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan. Sherwood was rescued from the mob by (Indian) locals. They hid the teacher, who was injured in the beating, before moving her to the fort. Dyer, who was the commandant of the infantry brigade in Jalandhar, was incensed that a European woman had been attacked and decided to take action. He arrived on 11 April to assume command.

===Events of 13 April===

The event known historically as the Amritsar massacre occurred on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar. The date coincided with that of the annual Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious and a cultural festival of the Punjabis, and would have attracted visitors from outside the city. On the morning of 13 April, Dyer issued a proclamation in English, Urdu and Punjabi at 19 locations around the city, and had handbills distributed, to the effect that a curfew was imposed, no processions were to take place, and that meetings of more than four individuals could be fired upon. By 12:30 that day, Dyer was informed that in defiance of his orders, a meeting was to be held in the Jallianwala Bagh.

Dyer was determined to suppress disobedience in Amritsar. The proposed meeting was to take place in the Jallianwala Bagh, in defiance of the proclamation; Dyer saw this as an opportunity to, in his view, suppress rebels, and, as he claimed, do so in isolation from the general populace. The meeting assembled at Jallianwala Bagh, a walled space of with five entrances, four of which were narrow, admitting only a few people at a time. The fifth entrance was that used by Dyer and his troops. The organiser of the meeting was Dr Mohammed Bashir, who was later found guilty of inciting the attack on the National Bank. Seven people had addressed the meeting before Dyer arrived, including Brij Gopi Nath who read a poem inciting people to war.

Dyer had at his command 50 troops, including 25 Gurkhas of 1/9 Gurkha Rifles (1st battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles), 25 Pathans and Baluch and 59th Sindh Rifles, armed with .303 Lee–Enfield rifles. He also had two armoured cars with machine guns, which were unable to pass through the entrance. Upon entering the Bagh, the general ordered the troops to shoot directly into the gathering. The shooting continued unabated for about 10 minutes, and the soldiers&#x27; supply of 1,650 rounds of ammunition was almost exhausted.

Dyer is reported to have, from time to time, &quot;checked his fire and directed it upon places where the crowd was thickest&quot;, not because the crowd was slow to disperse, but because he &quot;had made up his mind to punish them for having assembled there.&quot; Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which Dyer shouted: &quot;Fire low. What have you been brought here for?&quot; Later, Dyer&#x27;s own testimony revealed that the crowd was not given any warning to disperse and he was not remorseful for having ordered his troops to shoot.

The Hunter Commission report on the incident, published the following year by the Government of India, criticised both Dyer, and the Government of the Punjab for failing to compile a casualty count, so quoted a figure offered by the Sewa Samati (A Social Services Society) of 379 identified dead, comprising 337 men, 41 boys and a six-week-old baby, with approximately 1,100 wounded, of which 192 were seriously injured. However other estimates, from government civil servants in the city (commissioned by the Punjab Sub-committee of Indian National Congress), as well as counts from the Home Political, cite numbers of well over a thousand dead. According to a Home Political Deposit report, the number was more than 1,000, with more than 1,200 wounded. Dr Smith, a British civil surgeon at Amritsar, estimated that there were over 1,800 casualties. The infliction of these casualties earned Dyer the epithet of the &quot;Butcher of Amritsar&quot;.

===Subsequent events===
The day after the massacre Dyer continued along confrontational lines, even though the city was quiet. He met with a delegation of Amritsar citizens to whom he directed the following speech, without having received their petitions or heard from them. Made to the delegation in Urdu, the English translation of a segment of Dyer&#x27;s statement is shown below, as given in Collett&#x27;s &quot;The Butcher of Amritsar&quot;:

Dyer devised what even one of his generally supportive superiors, O&#x27;Dwyer, described as an &quot;irregular and improper&quot; retaliation for the attack on Marcella Sherwood, designed, it seemed, to fall indiscriminately and humiliatingly on the local population. On the street where the assault occurred, Kucha Kurrichhan, Dyer ordered daytime pickets placed at either end. Anyone wishing to proceed into the street between 6 am and 8 pm was made to crawl the on all fours, lying flat on their bellies. When questioned at the Hunter inquiry about this, Dyer explained his motivation: There was a curfew in effect from 8 pm, so the order effectively closed the street for the full 24 hours. The houses and shops had no back doors, so the inhabitants could not go out without climbing down from their roofs. No deliveries or services were available to those effectively locked in, so no food or other supplies could be replenished, any sick or injured had no medical attendance, and normal rubbish and latrine sanitary services were absent. The trapped inhabitants included some of the individuals responsible for rescuing and attending to Sherwood, the assault victim. This order was in effect from 19 April until 25, or possibly, 26 April 1919. In addition, Dyer had flogging triangles erected in the street; on these, youths arrested for the assault, some of whom were not subsequently convicted, were publicly flogged in view of the residents.

===Reaction in Britain and British India===
A committee of inquiry, chaired by Lord Hunter, was established to investigate the massacre. The committee&#x27;s report criticised Dyer, arguing that in &quot;continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that Colonel Dyer committed a grave error.&quot; Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime&#x27;s use of force was wholly unjustified. &quot;Colonel Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Michael O&#x27;Dwyer was of the same view,&quot; they wrote, &quot;(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.&quot; &quot;The Morning Post&quot; claimed Dyer was &quot;the man who saved India&quot; and started a benefit fund which raised over £26,000 sterling. Sources differ on how much, if anything Rudyard Kipling contributed to this fund and some sources claim that &#x27;the man who saved India&#x27; line came from Kipling. Michael O&#x27;Dwyer, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab from 1913 to 1919, endorsed Dyer and called the massacre a &quot;correct&quot; action. Some historians now believe he premeditated the massacre and set Dyer to work. Many Indians blamed O&#x27;Dwyer, and while Dyer was never assaulted, O&#x27;Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 by an Indian revolutionary, Sardar Udham Singh in retaliation for his role in the massacre.

Dyer was met by the Adjutant-General of India, Lieutenant-General Havelock Hudson, who told him that he was relieved of his command. He was told later by the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Charles Monro, to resign his post and that he would not be reemployed. He was heavily criticised both in Britain and India. Several senior and influential British government officials and Indians spoke against him, including:
*Pandit Motilal Nehru, father of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, who called the massacre the &quot;saddest and most revealing of all&quot;.
*Rabindranath Tagore, the first Asian Nobel Laureate and distinguished Indian educator, who renounced his knighthood in protest against the massacre and said, &quot;a great crime has been done in the name of law in the Punjab&quot;.
*Shankaran Nair, who resigned his membership of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council in the Legislative Council of Punjab in protest at the massacre.
*Punjab Legislative Council members Nawab Din Murad and Kartar Singh, who described the massacre as &quot;neither just nor humane.&quot;
*Charles Freer Andrews, an Anglican priest and friend of Gandhi, who termed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as a &quot;cold-blooded massacre and inhumane.&quot;
*Brigadier-General Herbert Conyers Surtees, who stated in the Dyer debate that &quot;we hold India by force – undoubtedly by force&quot;.
*Edwin Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, who called it &quot;a grave error in judgement&quot;. In a debate in the House of Commons, he asked, &quot;Are you going to keep your hold on India by terrorism, racial humiliation, subordination and frightfulness, or are you going to rest it upon the goodwill and the growing goodwill of the people of your Indian Empire?&quot;
*Winston Churchill, at the time Britain&#x27;s Secretary of State for War, who called the massacre &quot;an episode without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire... an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation... the crowd was neither armed nor attacking&quot; during a debate in the House of Commons. In a letter to the leader of the Liberals and former Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Crewe, he wrote, &quot;My own opinion is that the offence amounted to murder, or alternatively manslaughter.&quot;
*Leader of the Liberal Party and former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, who observed: &quot;There has never been such an incident in the whole annals of Anglo-Indian history, nor, I believe, in the history of our empire since its very inception down to present day. It is one of the worst outrages in the whole of our history.&quot;
*B. G. Horniman, who observed: &quot;No event within living memory, probably, has made so deep and painful impression on the mind of the public in this country [Britain] as what came to be known as the Amritsar massacre.&quot;

Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi had condemned the massacre, and launched the non-cooperation movement. Gandhi later forgave Dyer for the massacre. In 1938, Gandhi wrote: 

&quot;General Dyer himself surely believed that English men and women were in danger of losing their lives if he did not take the measures he did. We, who know better, call it an act of cruelty and vengeance. But from General Dyer’s own standpoint, he is justified. Many Hindus sincerely believe that it is a proper thing to kill a man who wants to kill a cow and he will quote scripture for his defence and many other Hindus will be found to justify his action. But strangers who do not accept the sacredness of the cow will hold it to be preposterous to kill a human being for the sake of slaying an animal (sic).&quot;

During the Dyer debates in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there was both praise and condemnation of Dyer. In 1920, the British Labour Party Conference at Scarborough unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the Amritsar massacre as a &quot;cruel and barbarous action&quot; of British officers in Punjab, and called for their trial, the recall of Michael O&#x27;Dwyer and the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, and the repealing of repressive legislation.

===Dyer&#x27;s response and motivation===
Dyer wrote an article in the &quot;Globe&quot; of 21 January 1921, entitled, &quot;The Peril to the Empire&quot;. It commenced with &quot;India does not want self-government. She does not understand it.&quot; Dyer wrote later that:
*&quot;There should be an eleventh commandment in India - &quot;Thou shalt not agitate&#x27;. All that the cultivator and the factory worker want is just and clear laws applicable to all alike. He does not always know why his passions have been roused and whether he is being misled, who is there to tell him but the Sahib? And now it seems that the Sahib is not allowed to tell him. He does not want an exchange of rulers.&quot;
*&quot;India will not be desirous or capable of self-government for generations, and when self-government does come, it will not be the leaders of revolt who will rule. The very names of most of the extremists smell in the nostrils of Indian manhood.&quot;
*&quot;Self-government for India is a horrible pretence which would set the people of the country at each other&#x27;s throats long before the beginnings of constructive work were made possible. Under self-government, India would commit suicide; but our politicians would be guilty of murder as associates in the crime.&quot;
*&quot;Gandhi will not lead India to capable self-government. The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men, to carry out the job it has taken in hand.&quot;

In his official response to the Hunter commission that inquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: &quot;I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.&quot;

However, in his account of the massacre Nick Lloyd comments that although Dyer later claimed to have undertaken the massacre to &quot;save&quot; British India, he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon. As well as being &quot;dazed and shaken up&quot; – hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind – all the witnesses recall how Dyer &quot;was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened&quot;.

Nigel Collett – author of the biography &quot;The Butcher of Amritsar&quot; – is convinced that the Amritsar massacre preyed on Dyer&#x27;s mind from the very day he opened fire. &quot;He spent the rest of his life trying to justify himself. He persuaded himself it had been his duty to act as he did, but he could not persuade his soul that he had done right. It rotted his mind and, I am guessing here, added to his sickness.&quot;

Collett quotes Dyer on the motivations that drove him to act as he did: &quot;It was no longer a question of merely dispersing the crowd but one of producing a sufficient moral effect, from a military point of view, not only on those who were present but more specially throughout the Punjab. There could be no question of undue severity. The mutineers had thrown out the challenge and the punishment, if administered at all, must be complete, unhesitating and immediate.&quot;

Historian Gordon Johnson comments that &quot;...Dyer&#x27;s actions ran counter to Army regulations. These required that force should be constrained by what was reasonable to achieve an immediate objective; minimum, not maximum, force should be deployed. Moreover, proper warning had to be given. On 13 April 1919, as demonstrated by Collett, Dyer ignored this. While he may have believed the Raj was threatened, and may have thought the mob was out to attack him and his soldiers, this does not justify his cavalier abuse of procedure and his indifference to Indian suffering. In so behaving, he brought not only death to the innocent but also destroyed himself and undermined the empire in which he took so much pride.&quot;

==Later life==
Churchill, the then Secretary of State for War, wanted Dyer to be disciplined, but the Army Council superseded by him decided to allow Dyer to resign with no plan for further punishment. Following Churchill&#x27;s speech defending the council&#x27;s decision and a debate in Parliament, on 8 July 1920 MPs voted for the government by a majority of 247 to 37; a motion calling for approval of Dyer&#x27;s actions was defeated by a majority of 230 to 129.

Having been born in India and educated in Ireland, Dyer then settled in Britain. He was presented with a gift of £26,000 sterling, (), which emerged from the fund raised on his behalf by &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, a conservative, pro-imperialist newspaper which later merged with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. A &quot;Thirteen Women Committee&quot; was constituted to present &quot;the Saviour of the Punjab with the sword of honour and a purse&quot;. Large contributions to the fund were made by civil servants and by British Army and Indian Army officers, although serving members of the military were not allowed to donate to political funds under the King&#x27;s Regulations (para. 443).

The &quot;Morning Post&quot; had supported Dyer&#x27;s action on the grounds that the massacre was necessary to &quot;Protect the honour of European Women&quot;.

Many Indians, including Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, were outraged by the fund for Dyer, particularly due to the families of the victims killed at the Jallianwala Bagh, who were still fighting for government compensation. In the end, they received Rs 500 (then equal to £37.10s.0d; ) for each victim.

Dyer acquired a farm at Ashton Fields, Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire, which was still given as his address when he died, although in 1925 he had bought a small cottage at Long Ashton on the outskirts of Bristol and spent his last two years there, while one of his sons lived at the farm.

Dyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes. He died of cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis on 23 July 1927. On his deathbed, Dyer reportedly said: The Conservative-leaning &quot;Morning Post&quot; defended him in an article titled &quot;The Man Who Saved India&quot;, where they wrote that Dyer &quot;did his duty, regardless of consequences&quot;. The Liberal-supporting &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; wrote a contrary opinion: &quot;No British action, during the whole course of our history in India, has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar.&quot; Although still owning property in Wiltshire, Dyer died at his cottage in Somerset, St Martin&#x27;s, Long Ashton, near Bristol. He left an estate valued at £11,941, .

==In popular culture==
In 1977, Dyer was depicted in the Indian movie &quot;Jallian Wala Bagh&quot;.

Dyer was portrayed by actor Edward Fox in the 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;.

R. E. Dyer is a character in Salman Rushdie’s 1981 novel &quot;Midnight’s Children&quot;, which dramatises the Amritsar massacre.

Dyer was also depicted in Indian movies such as The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002), and Sardar Udham (2021).

<text>The TOC protocol, or Talk to OSCAR protocol, was a protocol used by some third-party AOL Instant Messenger clients and several clients that AOL produced itself. Sometime near August 19, 2005, AOL discontinued support for the protocol and no longer uses it in any of the instant messaging clients it actively maintains, such as its Windows and Mac clients for the AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ systems. However, it once did produce several of its own TOC clients, including TiK and TAC which are written in Tcl/Tk, TNT which is written in Emacs Lisp, all of which are open source, and a Java client originally called TIC which later became the Quick Buddy web applet. AOL also provided the TOC protocol specification openly to developers in the hopes that they will use it instead of the proprietary OSCAR protocol they use themselves. In July 2012, AOL turned off the TOC2 servers and it is no longer possible to connect to AIM using this protocol.

TOC was an ASCII-based protocol, while OSCAR is a binary protocol. In addition, TOC contained fewer features than its OSCAR counterpart. OSCAR provides such functionality as buddy icons, file transfer, and advertising.

== How it works ==
TOC acted as a wrapper for the OSCAR protocol. In the grand scheme of things, the TOC server was nothing but an OSCAR client that happened to listen on a socket, translating messages between the two protocols. Upon login, the TOC client specified an OSCAR login server (presumably either or ) that the TOC server used on behalf of the client.

TOC used FLAP to encapsulate its messages just as OSCAR does, however, FLAP has been hacked in such a way that it can be implemented on the same port as an HTTP server. By default, the TOC server operated in HTTP mode, indistinguishable from a typical web server. If a connecting client, in place of an HTTP request, writes the string &quot;&quot; followed by two CRLFs, TOC would switch gears and start reading FLAP messages. Upon getting a user&#x27;s profile, the client was expected to re-connect to TOC and use it as an HTTP server, which would host the user&#x27;s profile in HTML.

Once connected, two basic message formats for communications inside of FLAP existed. Client-to-server messages were sent in a format resembling a Unix-style command line: commands with whitespace-separated arguments, quoting and backslash escape sequences. Server-to-client messages were much simpler: they were sent as colon-separated ASCII strings, in a manner similar to many Unix config files. Thus, it was quite easy to write a client, as the incoming messages were very easy to parse, and outgoing commands were easy to generate.

This is in contrast to OSCAR, which due to the binary representation of data can be more difficult to understand.

== TOC2 ==
The TOC2 protocol is an updated version of the TOC protocol, or &quot;Talk to OSCAR&quot; protocol. Its existence was never documented by AOL and it is only used in a few AOL Instant Messenger clients. Some clients are beginning to offer plugins for TOC2 in light of AOL&#x27;s recent shutdown of their TOC servers. Like its predecessor, TOC2 is an ASCII protocol and lacks some features of OSCAR, but unlike TOC, TOC2 is known to support buddy icons and receiving file transfers (not sending). TOC2 operates in essentially the same way as TOC, as a wrapper for OSCAR. Porting code from TOC to TOC2 is remarkably easy as well.

Because of the similarities between TOC1.0 and TOC2.0, they are better defined by their differences, of which there are only a few:
* In TOC1.0, connecting with an empty buddy list would make it so that others are not able to see you online. This has been corrected in TOC2.0.
* In TOC1.0, there is a toc_add_deny command, but no toc_remove_deny. TOC2.0 corrects this as well.
* The sign on process is basically the same as TOC1.0, but with a few new parameters: version, a number, and a code created based on the username and password. The purpose of the number is unknown. The default is 160 and it seems to have no effect if changed.
* Permitting and denying have been revamped and are much easier and full-featured in TOC2.0. The commands toc2_add_permit, toc2_remove_permit, toc2_add_deny, and toc2_remove_deny are all present and accessible at any time.
* Buddy list commands have also been improved. Group management is easier with the toc2_new_group and toc2_del_group commands. Also, it is possible to add or remove more than one buddy at a time, and choose the groups they are in.
* A few syntax changes have also been made, and parameters have been added to some commands. The uses of these parameters are still undetermined.
* Aside from this the only changes from TOC are the fact that a &#x27;2&#x27; was added on most commands both CLIENT-&gt;SERVER and vice versa. E.g. IM_IN2, UPDATE_BUDDY2, etc.
* TOC2 also limits the number of ScreenNames that can log in from a single IP address (10).

<text>Karl L. King (February 21, 1891 – March 31, 1971) was a United States march music bandmaster and composer. He is best known as the composer of &quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot;.

==Early life==

Karl Lawrence King was born in the village of Paintersville, Ohio. He was the only child of Sandusky S. and Anna Lindsey King. The King family moved to Canton, Ohio, when he was eleven, the age he used newspaper carrier income to purchase his first musical instrument – a cornet. He studied with Emile Reinkendorff, director of the Grand Army Band of Canton, on this instrument.

He grew up as a self-taught musician with very little schooling of any kind (he left school after the eighth grade, age fourteen). His only music instruction included assistance from local musicians when he played brass instruments in the Canton Marine Band. He also had four piano lessons and one harmony lesson from musical show director William Bradford. He learned to compose by studying scores. He quit school to learn the printing trade (while composing music at night), but soon switched to playing in and composing for bands.

His first professional positions were in the Thayer Military Band in Canton, directed by William E. Strassner followed by the Neddermeyer Band of Columbus, Ohio, conducted by Fred Neddermeyer. He switched from the cornet to the baritone horn, with Strassner instructing him on that instrument. He also played in the Soldier&#x27;s Home Band in Danville, Illinois.

==Circus band trouping 1910–1918==

In 1910 at the age of 19, he began a short career playing baritone in and directing circus bands. That year, he joined the Robinson Famous Shows under conductor Woodring Van Anda (&quot;Woody Van&quot;). The next year he was performing in the Yankee Robinson Circus band under Theo. Stout. In 1912, he performed in the Sells-Floto Circus under W.P. English (a famous march composer), and in 1913 in the Barnum and Bailey band under Ned Brill. At the request of Brill he wrote (and dedicated to Brill) &quot;Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot;, his most famous march and possibly the most recognizable American music written specifically for the circus. It would soon be adopted as the theme of the circus. 

His first full-time conducting job was in 1914 through 1915 with the Sells Floto Circus and Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show combined shows band. He became bandmaster for the Sells-Floto Circus in 1915 and was bandmaster of the Barnum and Bailey Circus band 1917–1918. In his final band, he included his wife Ruth (Lovett) as the calliope performer. He had married Ruth November 17, 1916.

In an interview in the last year of his life, King stated that his proudest moment was conducting the Barnum and Bailey band in Madison Square Garden.

==Life after circus bands==
King hoped to join John Philip Sousa at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station during World War I. With no openings on his staff at the time, Sousa suggested King apply to the army as bandmaster at Camp Grant. The war ended on his reporting date so King did not serve on active duty.

King remained in Canton as director of the local band. He began a music publishing business, the K.L. King Music House in 1919, the same year his only child Karl L. King, Jr. was born. The first publication of his new music company was &quot;Broadway One-Step&quot;.

After a year in Canton where he directed the Grand Army Band (1919) King settled down in Fort Dodge, Iowa. This was in 1920 (age 29) and for the next fifty-one years he conducted the Fort Dodge Municipal Band, which featured future American Bandmasters Association president Joseph Hermann on clarinet. The band became known as King&#x27;s Band.

King was instrumental in the passage of the Iowa Band Law in 1921, which allowed cities to levy a local tax for maintenance of a band. He commemorated this with one of his marches, &quot;Iowa Band Law&quot;. In 1960, King would direct &quot;Iowa Band Law&quot; with the largest mass band ever assembled: 188 high school bands and nearly 13,000 musicians at a nationally televised University of Michigan football game.

He was given a testimonial dinner for 250 people in 1951 at the age of 59 where band directors including Glenn Cliffe Bainum, Albert Austin Harding, Paul V. Yoder, and William H. Santelmann attended (as well as William S. Beardsley, the governor of Iowa).

Karl King died on March 31, 1971, of acute diverticulitis at age 80 in a Fort Dodge, Iowa hospital. He and his wife Ruth I. (Lovett) King (June 10, 1898 – July 4, 1988) are buried at North Lawn Cemetery. Their only son Karl L. King, Jr. was born in 1919 and died November 19, 1987.

A physical description of Karl King in the 1951 Who&#x27;s Who in Music: brown eyes, brown hair, 6’1” in height, 200 pounds.

==Compositions==
King the composer published more than 300 works: galops, waltzes, overtures, serenades, rags, and 188 marches and screamers. It could be said that King did for the circus march what Sousa did for the patriotic march. He seemed to like composing under pressure and often composed in tight spots (such as by oil lamp in cramped circus tents). His name appeared on the sheet music as Karl King, K. L. King, and sometimes Carl Lawrence.

His first known composition still extant was composed for the Thayer Military Band while he was performing it in – titled &quot;March T.M.B.&quot; (1909). His first copyrighted work was &quot;Moonlight on the Nile Waltz&quot; (also 1909).

King&#x27;s marches for circus bands are usually composed at a high difficulty level (grade 4–5 typically) American march music. He also contributed greatly to the school band movement with numerous compositions at various levels of difficulty.

&quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot; (1913) remains his best-known composition, but other pieces that retain their popularity among fans of band music include:

A disastrous fire on January 12, 1971, destroyed the Knights of Columbus Hall where the Fort Dodge Band held rehearsals and stored instruments and uniforms. The hall also held most of Karl King&#x27;s original manuscripts, including special arrangements.

<doc id="333455" wikidata="Q318347" url="?curid=333455" title="Sigismund of Burgundy">
<text>Sigismund (; died 524 AD) was King of the Burgundians from 516 until his death. He was the son of king Gundobad and Caretene. He succeeded his father in 516. Sigismund and his brother Godomar were defeated in battle by Clovis&#x27;s sons, and Godomar fled. Sigismund was captured by Chlodomer, King of Orléans, where he was kept as a prisoner. Later he, his wife and his children were executed. Godomar then rallied the Burgundian army and won back his kingdom.

== Life ==
Sigismund was a student of Avitus of Vienne, the Chalcedonian bishop of Vienne who converted Sigismund from the Arian faith of his Burgundian forebears. Sigismund was inspired to found a monastery dedicated to Saint Maurice at Agaune in Valais in 515. The following year he became king of the Burgundians.

==Sigismund&#x27;s conflict with Bishop Apollinaris==
Sigismund came into conflict with Apollinaris of Valence over the rules regarding marriage. The king&#x27;s treasurer, Stephen, was living in flagrant incest. The four bishops of the province ordered him to separate from his companion, but he appealed to Sigismund, who supported his official and exiled the four bishops to Sardinia. They refused to yield, and after some time the king relented, and permitted three of them to return to their Sees, with the exception of Apollinaris, whose defiance had made him particularly obnoxious to the king. He was kept a close prisoner for a year. At last the king, stricken with a severe illness, sent the Queen to request Apollinaris go to the court to restore the monarch to health. On his refusal, the Queen asked for his cloak to place on the sufferer. The request was granted, the king recovered, and Apollinaris was allowed to return to his see.

==Murder of his son==
According to Gregory of Tours, Sigismund married the daughter of the Ostrogoth King Theodoric. They had a son, Sigeric. The widowed Sigismund later remarried, and his second wife &quot;maltreated and insulted her stepson&quot;. When, on a feast day in 517, Sigeric saw his stepmother dressed in his late mother&#x27;s ceremonial clothes, he called out that she was unworthy to wear them. (Under Burgundian law, his mother&#x27;s clothes should have gone to his sister, Suavegotha.) The Queen persuaded Sigismund to deal with his son, alleging that Sigeric planned not only to kill his father and seize the throne, but that he also had designs on his grandfather&#x27;s kingdom in Italy. Sigismund ordered the young man to be taken while drunk and drowned in a well. Then, overcome with remorse, Sigismund retreated to the monastery that he had founded (perhaps on Île Barbe).

==Burgundian War, defeat and death of Sigismund==
In 523, Clotilde, daughter of Chilperic II of Burgundy who had been slain by Sigismund&#x27;s father Gundobad in 493, took revenge for the murder of her father, when she incited her sons against Sigismund, and provoked the Burgundian War, which led to Sigismund&#x27;s deposition and imprisonment, and his assassination the following year. In 523, the Kingdom of the Burgundians was invaded by the four Frankish kings, Chlodomer, Childebert I, Clotaire I and Theuderic I, children of Frankish king Clovis I and Sigismund&#x27;s first cousins once removed by Clotilde. Sigismund and his brother Godomar led the Burgundian defence but lost the battle. Godomar fled while Sigismund put on a monk&#x27;s habit and hid in a cell near his abbey. He was captured by Chlodomer, king of Aurelianum (modern Orléans), beheaded and his body thrown in a well. Sigismund&#x27;s wife and remaining children were also put to death.

==Aftermath==
Sigismund was succeeded on the throne by his brother Godomar. Godomar then rallied the Burgundian army and called for aid from his ally, the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. Godomar regained his territory; the garrisons that the Franks had left behind were massacred.

Chlodomer marched with his brother Theuderic I, King of Metz, on Burgundy in 524. Chlodomer was killed at the Battle of Vézeronce, which took place on 25 June 524, reportedly at the hands of Godomar.

== Veneration ==

In 535, Sigismund&#x27;s remains were recovered from the well at Coulmiers and buried in the monastery at Agaune. Eventually Sigismund was canonized. Correspondence has survived between Sigismund and Avitus of Vienne, who was a poet and one of the last masters of the classical literary arts.

In 1366, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, transferred Sigismund&#x27;s relics to Prague, hence he has become a patron saint of the Kingdom of Bohemia, now Czech Republic. 

The emperor gave the saint&#x27;s name to one of his sons, the later King Sigismund of Hungary (who also became decades later King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor). In 1424, Sigismund of Hungary constructed a church in the honor of Saint Sigismund in the City of Buda. The same year, King Sigismund took the relics of Saint Sigismund from Prague and sent them to the Hungarian city of Varad to protect them from the Hussites.

== Family and issue ==
In 494, he married Ostrogotha, the illegitimate daughter of Theodoric the Great and a concubine, as a part of Theodoric&#x27;s negotiation for an alliance with Sigismund and the Burgundians. They had the following issue:

* Sigeric (494/95 – 517), murdered by his own father
* Suavegotha (495/96 – ?), married to Theuderic I, son of Clovis I
* Daughter, name unknown

<text>Vaccinium virgatum (commonly known as rabbit-eye blueberry, smallflower blueberry or southern black blueberry ) is a species of blueberry native to the Southeastern United States, from North Carolina south to Florida and west to Texas.

==Description==
&quot;Vaccinium virgatum&quot; is a deciduous shrub growing to 3 to 6 feet tall and with up to a 3-foot spread. The leaves are spirally arranged, oblate to narrow elliptic, 3 inches long and start red-bronze in the spring only to develop into a dark-green. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, 5 mm long. The fruit is a berry 5 mm diameter, dark blue to black, bloomed pale blue-gray by a thin wax coating. Cytology is 2n = 72.

==Pollination==
&quot;Vaccinium virgatum&quot; is self-infertile, and must have two or more varieties to pollenize each other. Honeybees are inefficient pollinators, and carpenter bees frequently cut the corollas to rob nectar without pollinating the flowers. &quot;V. virgatum&quot; does best when pollinated by buzz pollination by bees, such as the native southeastern blueberry bee, &quot;Habropoda laboriosa&quot;.

==Uses==

===Culinary===
Berries of &quot;Vaccinium virgatum&quot; are edible and are used as sauces and syrups, and for breads, muffins, pancakes, and pies, and may have pain killing properties (antinociceptive effects).

===Ornamental===
&quot;Vaccinium virgatum&quot; is grown as an ornamental plant, especially for its fall colors, typically bright orange or red.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Vaccinium virgatum&quot; grows best on acid soil and is subject to few pests and diseases. Because it is not self-fruitful, two compatible varieties should be planted next to each other to maintain fruiting. If maintained with mulching, it may endure temperatures as low as 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants mature to heights from 3 to 6 feet, with a width of up to 3 feet. The plant has few insect or disease problems, however birds and squirrels consume its fruit.

<doc id="333459" wikidata="Q937440" url="?curid=333459" title="Popping">
<text>Popping is a street dance adapted out of the earlier boogaloo cultural movement in Oakland, California. As boogaloo spread, it would be referred to as &quot;robottin&#x27;&quot; in Richmond, California; strutting movements in San Francisco and San Jose; and the Strikin&#x27; dances of the Oak Park community in Sacramento, which were popular through the mid-1960s to the 1970s.

Popping would be eventually adapted from earlier boogaloo (freestyle dance) movements in Fresno, California, in the late 1970s by way of California high school gatherings of track and meet events: the West Coast Relays. The dance is rooted in the rhythms of live funk music, and is based on the technique of boogaloo&#x27;s posing approach, quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk, or can be a sudden stop in the dancer&#x27;s body, referred to as a &quot;pose&quot;, &quot;pop&quot; or a &quot;hit&quot;. This is done continuously to the rhythm of a song, in combination with various movements and poses.

The dance was popularized by a Fresno and Long Beach-based dance group called the Electric Boogaloos, which mixed popping techniques with boogaloo. Closely related dance styles and techniques are often integrated into popping to create a more varied performance. These dance styles include the robot, waving and tutting. However, popping is distinct from breaking and locking, with which it is often confused. A popping dancer is commonly referred to as a &quot;popper&quot;.

Popping developed before hip hop and helped influence the tradition of styles of hip hop dancing. It is often performed in battles, in which participants try to outperform each other in front of a crowd, giving room for improvisation and freestyle moves that are seldom seen in shows and performances, such as interaction with other dancers and spectators. Popping, and related styles such as waving and tutting, have also been incorporated into the electronica dance scene to some extent, influencing new styles such as liquid and digits and turfing.

==Terminology==
As stated earlier, &quot;popping&quot; has become the latest umbrella term for a group of closely related styles and techniques rooted in the boogaloo tradition that have often been combined, evolved or danced together with popping, some of which are seldom seen outside of popping contexts.

==Characteristics==
Popping is centered around the technique of &quot;popping&quot;, which means to quickly contract and relax muscles to create a jerking effect (a &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;hit&quot;) in the body. It is also known as posing hard from the boogaloo tradition; this technique was innovated by the Oakland-based boogaloo group the Black Messengers. Popping can be concentrated to specific body parts, creating variants such as arm pops, leg pops, chest pops and neck pops.

==Music==
With its roots in the late 1970s funk era, popping is commonly danced to funk and disco music. Popular artists include Zapp, Dayton, Dazz Band and Cameo. During the 1980s, many poppers also utilized electro music, with artists such as Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Egyptian Lover and World Class Wrecking Crew. More mainstream hip hop music was also employed by poppers during the 1980s, including Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, Whodini and Run-DMC. Today, it is common to see popping danced to more current music genres, such as modern hip hop (often abstract/instrumental hip hop) and various forms of electronic dance music, such as dubstep.

Poppers generally favor music with a straight and steady beat of 90–120 beats per minute, a 4/4 time signature, and a strong emphasis on the back beat, normally by a snare drum or a drum machine. The pops are generally performed on every beat or on the distinct back beats. The popper can also choose to follow the music more freely, such as by timing the pops to the rhythm of a melody or other rhythmic elements.

== Variations ==

; Animation
: A style and a technique where the dancer imitates film characters being animated by stop motion. The technique of moving rigidly and jerky by tensing muscles and using techniques similar to strobing and the robot makes it appear as if the dancer has been animated frame by frame. Walt Disney was the first to use this term, referring to his character Steam Boat Willie’s motions as &quot;the animation dance&quot; in 1929. This style was heavily inspired by the dynamation films created by Ray Harryhausen, such as &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958).
; Boogaloo
: Boogaloo or &quot;bug&#x27;n&quot; is an older umbrella name of funk dances originating in Oakland, California. It can be described as a free-form dance style with loose movements trying to give the impression of a body lacking bones, partly inspired by animated movies and cartoons. It utilizes circular rolls of various body parts, such as the hips, chest, shoulders, knees and head; this technique is also referred to as &quot;wormin&quot; and isolates sections of the body toward funk rhythms, especially sectioning through separating the rib cage from the hip. &quot;Wormin&quot; was innovated by Jerry Rentie of One Plus One., and the rolling of the chest or &quot;wiggling&quot; was innovated by Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Mathews. It also makes heavy use of angles and various steps and transitions to get from one spot to the next.
; Tutting/King Tut
: Inspired by the art of Ancient Egypt (the name derived from the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, colloquially known as &quot;King Tut&quot;), tutting exploits the body&#x27;s ability to create geometric positions (such as boxes) and movements, predominantly with the use of right angles. It generally focuses on the arms and hands, and includes sub-styles such as finger tutting.

<doc id="333464" wikidata="Q448948" url="?curid=333464" title="Billy Rose">
<text>Billy Rose (born William Samuel Rosenberg; September 6, 1899 – February 10, 1966) was an American impresario, theatrical showman, lyricist and columnist. For years both before and after World War II, Billy Rose was a major force in entertainment, with shows such as &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Crazy Quilt&quot; (1931), &quot;Jumbo&quot; (1935), &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade&quot; (1937), and &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1943). As a lyricist, he is credited with many songs, notably &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Lulu&quot; (1925), &quot;Tonight You Belong To Me&quot; (1926), &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot; (1927), &quot;More Than You Know&quot; (1929), &quot;Without a Song&quot; (1929), &quot;It Happened in Monterrey&quot; (1930), and &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; (1933).

Despite his accomplishments, Rose may be best known today as the husband of comedian and singer Fanny Brice (1891–1951).

==Life and work==
Rose was born to a Jewish family in New York City. He attended Public School 44, where he was the 50-yard dash champion. While in high school, Billy studied shorthand under John Robert Gregg, the inventor of the Gregg System for shorthand notation. He won a dictation contest using Gregg notation, taking over 150 words per minute, and writing forward or backward with either hand.

Billy Rose began his career as a stenographic clerk to Bernard Baruch of the War Industries Board during World War I, and became head of the clerical staff. Later he became a lyricist. In this role, he is best known as the credited writer or co-writer of the lyrics to &quot;Me and My Shadow,&quot; &quot;Great Day&quot; (with Edward Eliscu), &quot;Does the Spearmint Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight&quot; (with Marty Bloom), &quot;I Found a Million Dollar Baby&quot; (with Mort Dixon) and &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; (with E. Y. Harburg).

Most of Rose&#x27;s lyrical credits were collaborations. Biographer Earl Conrad said, &quot;Nobody clearly knew what he wrote or didn&#x27;t write... Publishers tend to credit him with writing the songs known to bear his name as a lyricist... But tales rumble on ... that Billy could feed and toss in a remark and monkey around, but that others did most of the writing.&quot; Lyricists might have been willing to tolerate a Rose credit grab because Rose was very successful at promoting &quot;his&quot; songs.

He went on to become a Broadway producer, and a theatre/nightclub owner. In June 1934, he opened Billy Rose&#x27;s Music Hall at 52nd Street and Broadway in New York City with the first Benny Goodman Orchestra. He produced &quot;Jumbo&quot;, starring Jimmy Durante, at the New York Hippodrome Theatre. For the Fort Worth Frontier Centennial (1936–37), he constructed the huge elaborate dinner theatre Casa Mañana which featured celebrated fan-dancer Sally Rand and the world&#x27;s largest revolving stage. He produced the Aquacade at the Great Lakes Exposition in Cleveland, Ohio in 1937.

Rose was diminutive in stature. When he attended a show, his practice was to book four seats: one for himself, one for his date, and the two in front of those so he would have an unobstructed view.

In 1929, he married Fanny Brice, who went on to star in the 1931 Broadway production of &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Crazy Quilt&quot;. The marriage ended in divorce in 1938.

In 1938, he opened Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe, a nightclub in New York City&#x27;s Times Square in the basement of the Paramount Hotel. It initially opened with a version of his Fort Worth show. The Diamond Horseshoe operated under that name until 1951.

At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade&quot; starred Olympian Eleanor Holm in what the fair program called &quot;a brilliant girl show of spectacular size and content.&quot; Future MGM star Esther Williams and Tarzan star Johnny Weissmuller were both &quot;Aquacade&quot; headliners. Rose began an affair with the then-married Holm, who left her husband for Rose. The couple married in 1939.

Following the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, Rose asked John Murray Anderson, who had staged the &quot;Aquacade&quot;, to recommend a choreographer for a new show at the Horseshoe. Anderson recommended Gene Kelly, then performing in William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;One for the Money&quot;. Rose objected that he wanted someone who could choreograph &quot;tits and asses,&quot; not &quot;soft-soap from a crazy Armenian&quot; (Yudkoff, 2001). However, after seeing Kelly&#x27;s performance, he gave Kelly the job, an important step in Kelly&#x27;s career.

In 1943, he produced &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; with an all-black cast. An adaptation of Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen,&quot; the story was transplanted to World War II America by lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. It was an instant hit. The &quot;New York Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;far and away the best show in New York&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it was &quot;beautifully done ... just call it wonderful.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said that Oscar Hammerstein II &quot;must be considered one of the greatest librettists of our day&quot; and that &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; was &quot;a masterly tour de force.&quot; It was made into a motion picture in 1954, for which Dorothy Dandridge received an Oscar nomination.

In 1946, Rose&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Wine, Women and Words&quot;, dedicated to Rose&#x27;s early patron Bernard M. Baruch, was published in New York by Simon &amp; Schuster. The book was illustrated, including the cover of the numbered and signed first edition of 1,500 copies, by Salvador Dalí whom Rose met while producing events at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair.

Following the publication of &quot;Wine, Women and Words&quot; Rose appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on June 2, 1947.

In 1946, he began publishing a series of ads for the Diamond Horseshoe in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. This led to a syndicated column, &quot;Pitching Horseshoes&quot;, that Rose produced until December, 1950. At its height, it reached 2,000 newspapers.

Rose and Holm divorced in 1954. On July 2, 1956, he married showgirl Joyce Mathews (1919–1999), and they divorced July 23, 1959. They then remarried on December 29, 1961, only to divorce again on February 10, 1964, exactly two years before he died. (In the 1940s, Mathews had twice married and twice divorced comedian Milton Berle.) Later in 1964, Rose married Doris Ruth Vidor (née Warner; 1912–1978), who was the widow of film director Charles Vidor.

Rose founded the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel. His legendary pragmatism is illustrated by a seeming minor event at the sculpture garden opening ceremony, which Rose attended personally. When asked by one of the many distinguished guests what, in the event of war, Rose would have Israel do with these artworks, many of which were modern, steel abstracts, Rose unsmilingly replied, &quot;Melt them down for bullets.&quot;

From 1949 until 1955, Rose was the owner-operator of the Ziegfeld Theatre. During that time, the theater housed four musicals and five plays. In 1965, he sold the theater to be demolished to make way for a new skyscraper, the Fisher Brothers&#x27; Burlington House.

Rose was a board member of American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). ASCAP often slandered rock-and-roll songs. Because rock-and-roll performers increasingly wrote the music and lyrics themselves, professional songwriters lost their dominance in the music industry. As an ASCAP member, Billy Rose labeled rock-and-roll songs &quot;junk&quot; and was quoted as saying, &quot;in many cases they are obscene junk much on the level with dirty comic magazines.&quot;

==Later years and death==
From 1959 until his death in 1966, he was also the owner–operator of the Billy Rose Theater. During that time the theater housed four plays, one musical, one revue, three ballets, and twenty-nine concert performances. After his death, the theater retained its name, and remained in the ownership of his estate until 1978, when it was renamed. Today, it is the Nederlander Theatre.

In 1965, Rose was offered, but declined, the role to oversee the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair towards its conclusion.

Rose was a wealthy man when he died of lobar pneumonia at his vacation home in Montego Bay, Jamaica, at the age of 66. At the time of his death, his fortune was estimated at $42 million ($ in dollars), which he left entirely to the Billy Rose Foundation (for the support of fine and performing arts), disowning both of his sisters. He is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

In 1970, Rose was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Depictions==
Rose was a leading character in the 1975 musical film &quot;Funny Lady,&quot; a sequel to &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, which continues the story of Fanny Brice, again played by Barbra Streisand. Despite physical dissimilarities, actor James Caan was cast as Rose.

The 1962 film &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot;, starring Doris Day, depicted the original Broadway show staged by Rose. Although he was not involved in the making of the film, a contractual stipulation made it mandatory that his name appear in the title.

Saul Bellow&#x27;s novella, &quot;The Bellarosa Connection&quot;, depicts Billy Rose as a benevolent figure helping Jewish people to escape the Nazis in Europe.

<text>High Energy Transient Explorer 1 (HETE-1) was a NASA astronomical satellite with international participation (mainly Japan and France).

== History ==
The concept of a satellite capable of multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) was discussed at the Santa Cruz, California meeting on GRBs in 1981. In 1986, the first realistic implementation of the HETE concept by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT-led International Team was proposed. This concept, which was adopted, emphasized accurate locations and multi-wavelength coverage as the primary scientific goals for a sharply-focused small satellite mission which would ultimately solve the gamma-ray burst mystery.

In 1989, NASA approved funding for a low-cost &quot;University Class&quot; explorer satellite to search for GRBs. In 1992, the HETE-1 program was funded, and the design and construction of HETE-1 began. The original spacecraft contractor for HETE-1 was AeroAstro, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia. AeroAstro was responsible for the spacecraft bus, including power, communications, attitude control, and computers.

The instrument complement for HETE-1 consisted of four wide-field gamma-ray detectors, supplied by the CESR of Toulouse, France.
A wide-field coded-aperture X-ray imager, supplied by a collaboration of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Institute of Chemistry and Physics (RIKEN) of Tokyo, Japan.
Four wide-field near-UV CCD cameras, supplied by the Center for Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Due to the tragic fate of HETE-1 and the continuing timeliness of GRB science, NASA agreed to a reflight of the HETE-1 satellite, using flight spare hardware from the first satellite. In July 1997, funding for a second HETE satellite was granted, with a target launch date early 2000.

== Mission ==
The prime objective of HETE-1 was to carry out the first multi-wavelength study of GRBs with ultraviolet (UV), X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments mounted on a single, compact spacecraft. A unique feature of the HETE-1 mission was its capability to localize GRBs with ~10 arcseconds accuracy in near real time aboard the spacecraft, and to transmit these positions directly to a network of receivers at existing ground-based observatories enabling rapid, sensitive follow-up studies in the radio, infrared (IR), and visible light bands.

== Spacecraft ==
The satellite bus for the HETE-1 satellite was designed and built by AeroAstro, Inc. (USA) of Herndon, Virginia. The HETE-1 spacecraft was Sun-pointing with four solar panels connected to the bottom of the spacecraft bus. Spacecraft attitude was to be controlled by magnetic torque coils and a momentum wheel.

== Experiments ==
=== Omnidirectional Gamma-Ray Spectrometer ===
The Omnidirectional Gamma-Ray Spectrometer was designed to operate from 6 keV to greater than 1 MeV. The instrument consisted of four wide-field gamma-ray detectors with a total effective area of . The HETE satellite remained within the launch vehicle due to battery failure. The experiment was unable to operate.

=== Ultraviolet Transient Camera Array ===
The Ultraviolet Transient Camera Array was designed to provide accurate directional information on transient events, and to assist with spacecraft attitude determination. The instrument consisted of four ultraviolet Charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras operating in the 5 to 7 eV range.

=== Wide Field X-ray Monitor ===
The Widefield X-ray Monitor was designed to perform X-ray studies of gamma-ray bursts. The instrument consisted of coded aperture cameras, sensitive in the 2-25 keV energy range, and with location accuracy to ~ 10 arcminutes or better.

== Launch ==
The HETE-1 satellite was launched with the Argentina satellite SAC-B. HETE-1 was lost during the launch on 4 November 1996, at 17:08:56 UTC, from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), launch area-3. The Pegasus XL launch vehicle achieved a good orbit, but explosive bolts releasing HETE-1 from another satellite, SAC-B, and from its Dual Payload Attach Fitting (DPAF) envelope failed to charge, dooming both satellites. A battery on the third stage of the launch vehicle and responsible for these bolts cracked during the ascent. Due to its inability to deploy the solar panels, HETE lost power several days after launch.

== Atmospheric entry ==
HETE-1 re-entered on 7 April 2002.

<text>Megalopoli () is a town in the southwestern part of the regional unit of Arcadia, southern Greece. It is located in the same site as ancient Megalopolis ( literally &quot;large/great city&quot;). When it was founded in 371 BCE, it was the first large urbanization in rustic Arcadia. Its theatre had a capacity of 20,000 visitors, making it one of the largest ancient Greek theatres.

Today Megalopoli has several schools, shops, churches, hotels and other services. The population of Megalopoli in 2021 was 5,344 residents.


==Geography==

Megalopoli is situated in a wide valley, surrounded by mountains: the Taygetus to the south, the Mainalo to the north, the Tsemperou to the southeast and the Lykaion to the west. Its elevation is 430 m above sea level. The river Alfeios flows through this valley, coming from the east and flowing to the north, passing south and west of the town. Its tributary Elissonas passes north of the town. The large lignite deposits around Megalopoli are being exploited by open-pit mining. The Megalopoli Power Plant, 3 km northwest of the town centre, has produced electricity from this lignite since 1969.

==History==
The area of Megalopolis features lignite deposits, which are prone to catching fire in summer and can smoulder and scorch the earth for weeks. In antiquity, it was often identified as the site of the mythical Gigantomachy where the Greek giants were defeated and killed in a decisive battle with the gods, possibly inspired by enormous bones dug up from around the area taken as giants&#x27; bones, as mentioned by Ancient Greek writers such as Pausanias. These have been conjectured in modern times to be those of Pleistocene fossil animals which are still often unearthed from the area today, such as those of the extinct straight-tusked elephant. These animal bones and lignite deposits come from sediments which were deposited around 900-150,000 years ago, when the Megalopolis area contained a large shallow lake. Evidence has been found from these deposits for the inhabiting of the area by the extinct human species &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; around 500-400,000 years ago, with evidence for the butchery of straight-tusked elephants and the extinct large hippopotamus &quot;Hippopotamus antiquus&quot; by these hominins.

Megalopolis is known for its ancient ruins situated northwest of the town centre, on both banks of the river Elisson. The ruins include an ancient theatre that used to hold up to 20,000 people and was tall. Other landmarks include the Thersileon with 67 pillars and a temple ().

The city was founded through a synodical of twenty to forty neighbouring communities between 371 and 368 BC by the Arcadian League in an attempt to form a political counterweight to Sparta. Megalopolis was a member of the Arcadian League after its foundation until the dissolution of the federation in 362 BC. In 353 BC, when Thebes had her hands full with the so-called Sacred War, the Spartans made an attempt to reduce Megalopolis; but the Thebans sent assistance and the city was rescued. In 331 BC, Megalopolis was invaded by the Spartans and there was a battle with the Macedonians that came to Megalopolis&#x27; help. In 317 BC at the start of the Second War of the Diadochi, Polyperchon, the new Regent of the Macedonian Empire, besieged Megalopolis which had sided with his enemy Cassander. The siege failed.

In the 270s BC, Aristodemus the Good managed to take control over the city as a tyrant backed by Macedon. In 235 BC, the second tyrant of the city, Lydiades, gave up control over the polis and the city became a member of the Achaean League. In 222 BC, the Spartan king Cleomenes III burnt down the city, but it was rebuilt in the years after the destruction.

As a member of the Achaean League, Megalopolis had a profound influence on the federal politics and it was the hometown of several notable Achaean figures such as Philopoemen, Lykortas and Polybius.
Rome conquered Megalopolis during the Third Macedonian War in 146 BCE, as part of their conquest of Greece. The city remained populated under the Romans but by the 6th century it was almost completely abandoned. During the Byzantine era, and later also the Ottoman, the town on the same place was called Sináno (Σινάνο). It was renamed Megalopoli after the Greek War of Independence.

Megalopoli retained a rural character until the early 1960s, when with the help of Megalopoli-born Prof. Leonidas Zervas (then Minister of Industry) the Greek Public Power Corporation started mining lignite in the Megalopoli Mine and the construction of the Megalopoli Power Plant followed soon. The Megalopoli Mine is one of the largest lignite mines in Greece. The town was struck by the massive Arcadia earthquake of 5 April 1965, in which 17 inhabitants died and 80% of residences were demolished or rendered uninhabitable.

<text>Conures are a diverse, loosely defined group of small to medium-sized parrots. They belong to several genera within a long-tailed group of the New World parrot subfamily Arinae. Most conures belong to the tribe Arini, though &quot;Myiopsitta&quot; is an exception. The term &quot;conure&quot; is used primarily in bird keeping, though it has appeared in some scientific journals. The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union uses the generic term &quot;parakeet&quot; for all species elsewhere called &quot;conure&quot;, though Joseph Forshaw, a prominent Australian ornithologist, uses &quot;conure&quot;.


== Description ==
Conures are either large parakeets or small parrots found in the Western Hemisphere. They are analogous in size and way of life to Afro-Eurasia&#x27;s rose-ringed parakeets or the Australian parakeets. All living conure species live in Central and South America. The extinct &quot;Conuropsis carolinensis&quot;, or Carolina parakeet was an exception. Conures are often called the clowns of the parrot world due to their constant attention seeking behavior including hanging upside-down and swaying back and forth or &quot;dancing&quot;.

Despite being large for parakeets, conures are lightly built with long tails and small (but strong) beaks. Conure beaks always have a small cere and are usually horn-colored (gray) or black. Most conure species live in flocks of 20 or more birds. Conures often eat grain, and so are treated as agricultural pests in some places.

Conures are as diverse a group as African parrots, so trying to characterize them all is difficult and inaccurate. The category &quot;conure&quot; is loosely defined because they do not currently constitute a natural, scientific grouping. The term &quot;conure&quot; is now used mostly in aviculture. Scientists tend to refer to these birds as &quot;parrots&quot; or &quot;parakeets&quot;. The sun conure is one of the few species that is regularly called a conure even in scientific texts. (&quot;See below under &quot;Scientific classification&quot; for more details.&quot;)
== Species ==
Conures, as the term is used by aviculturists, include only the genera &quot;Aratinga&quot;, &quot;Pyrrhura&quot;, &quot;Eupsittula&quot; and &quot;Psittacara&quot;, as well as several single-species genera and one two-species genus. Not all members of these genera are called &quot;conures&quot; with equal frequency; some are more often referred to as parakeets. 
These other genera are listed below:
* &quot;Conuropsis&quot;: Carolina parakeet (extinct)
* &quot;Cyanoliseus&quot;: Patagonian conure
* &quot;Enicognathus&quot;: austral and slender-billed conures
* &quot;Guarouba&quot;: golden or Queen Of Bavaria conure
* &quot;Leptosittaca&quot;: golden-plumed conure
* &quot;Ognorhynchus&quot;: yellow-eared conure
* &quot;Thectocercus&quot;: blue-crowned conure

=== &quot;Aratinga&quot; ===
Old Tupi for &quot;bright macaw&quot;, (&quot;ara&quot; – &quot;macaw&quot;, &quot;tinga&quot; &quot;bright&quot;) the &quot;Aratinga&quot; conures generally seem to have a more mischievous personality than the real little macaws or mini-macaws. Popular as pets, the &quot;Aratinga&quot; conures are generally larger than other conure species with brighter plumage and are generally the noisier, more outgoing, and more demanding of the two primary conure genera. The colorful sun conure and jandaya parakeet are among the species of conures more commonly kept as pets. Many of the &quot;Aratinga&quot; species can be quite loud, but otherwise can make very good pets for responsible owners. Their lifespans are 20–30 years.

Nanday conures (&quot;Aratinga nenday&quot;) have a distinctive black head, and wings and tails tipped with dark-blue feathers. They have a light-blue scarf and bright-orange feathers on their legs and around their vents. The maturity of a nanday can be told by the edges of its black hood; if the hood has a ragged edge of brown, then the bird is over a year old. Nandays are often extremely noisy; they are a heavily flock-oriented species, used to making their demands known, calling out warnings for the group, and calling to members of the group that are out of sight. They are also extremely social and intelligent birds, capable of learning tricks, mimicking sounds, and learning a decent vocabulary. At least one report suggests that they are highly adaptable to human encroachment on their territories, but the exact status of the species in the wild is unknown.

Flocks of nanday conures live wild in parts of Florida, notably the west coast, including areas of St. Petersburg and Clearwater. Additionally, flocks of wild Nanday conures live in Siesta Key, Sarasota, Florida. A large flock of nanday conures lives in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. They have been in the area for the past several years.

Golden-capped conures (&quot;Aratinga auricapillus&quot;)—also known as golden-capped parakeets—are native to Brazil and Paraguay. Their natural habitats include subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, dry savanna, and plantations. The existence of this conure is threatened by habitat loss. However, golden-capped conures are prolific breeders, making them popular birds in aviculture, and hand-fed young are generally available.

Golden-capped conures grow to about in length and weigh about . Their bodies are mainly green with blackish bills, gray feet, and brown irises. The forehead, the areas around the eyes, and underwing coverts are usually red. The breast feathers are a red and green mix. Their tail feathers are olive green with a bluish tip. The primary feathers, wing coverts, and under wing coverts are blue.

Immature golden-capped conures are mostly green, with some orange around the eyes, above the beak, and on the breast near the wings. Some navy is mixed in with the green of the tail. The birds&#x27; full colorations are not seen until they are sexually mature at about two years of age. Their lifespan is about 30 years.

=== &quot;Pyrrhura&quot; ===
&quot;Pyrrhura&quot; is the other prominent genus of conures. These conures (with generally more green colors) include the very common green-cheeked conure, maroon-bellied conure, pearly conure, black-capped conure, painted conure, crimson-bellied conure, and a number of other species. They are usually smaller, have more subdued colors, and are much quieter than the &quot;Aratinga&quot; conures. &quot;Pyrrhura&quot; species are growing in popularity as pet birds, primarily due to their quiet nature (relative to comparable companion parrots), their affectionate and intelligent personalities, and the increasing number of color mutations developed in several of these species. &quot;Pyrrhura&quot; conures typically live around 20 or 25 years. To reach full maturity, many of them molt to rid themselves of feathers from previous growth stages, and occasionally, young birds pluck their feathers during the winter. These birds in captivity have been observed using their feathers to scratch themselves.

=== &quot;Psittacara&quot; ===
Until 2013, all &quot;Psittacara&quot; conures were part of the genus &quot;Aratinga&quot;. Included here are common pet species such as the red-masked parakeet (or cherry-headed conure) and mitred parakeet. All members of &quot;Psittacara&quot; are predominantly green parrots, with some species having areas of red plumage.

=== &quot;Eupsittula&quot; ===
As with the &quot;Psittacara&quot; species, the parrots now contained within the genus &quot;Eupsittula&quot; - including the familiar orange-fronted parakeet (or half-moon conure) were included in &quot;Aratinga&quot; until 2013.

=== Golden conure ===
The golden conure or Queen of Bavaria conure, &quot;Guaruba guarouba&quot; (recently reclassified from &quot;Aratinga guarouba&quot;) is, as the name implies, covered all over with bright yellow feathers, except for the green wing-tip feathers and the greyish horn-colored beak. Golden conures are among the most expensive conures both to purchase and to care for, although many owners feel that the benefits outweigh the cost. It is one of the rarest conures in the wild in addition to the pet trade. Many experts believe that these birds should not be kept in captivity unless in a breeding program.

=== Patagonian conure ===

The Patagonian conure, also known as the burrowing parrot, &quot;Cyanoliseus patagonus&quot;, is the largest conure. It is found in the Patagonia region of south-central Argentina and Chile. Drab on the top, brightly colored underneath, the Patagonian conure has increased in popularity since the 1990s, leading to an increase in illegal importation that threatens wild populations, but they are fairly commonly bred in captivity. Patagonian conures have a reputation for being exceptionally sweet-natured and intelligent, but can be very loud and destructive with their chewing. The greater Patagonian conure (&quot;C. p. bloxami&quot; or &quot;C. p. byroni&quot;) is the largest of all the conures. They can learn to talk and they usually bond very well with people, especially if hand-raised, and although not the most colorful bird, they make great pets.

=== &quot;Enicognathus&quot; ===
This genus comprises the austral conure, &quot;Enicognathus ferrugineus&quot;, which is native to the southern tip of South America and the slender-billed conure, &quot;E. leptorhynchus&quot;, endemic to Chile.

=== Golden-plumed conure ===
The golden-plumed conure, also called the golden-plumed parakeet, &quot;Leptosittaca branickii&quot;, is a small Andean conure not found in aviculture and endangered in its own habitat.

=== Yellow-eared conure ===
The exceedingly rare yellow-eared conure or &quot;Ognorhynchus icterotis&quot; of Colombia and Ecuador, was never common in aviculture and has not successfully bred in captivity.

=== Carolina parakeet ===
&quot;Conuropsis carolinensis&quot;, the Carolina parakeet, was one of only two parrot species endemic to the United States in recorded history. The Carolina parakeet was a remarkably social bird, living in vast flocks. American bird hunters reported that Carolina parakeets would return to mourn dead members of the flock, making themselves easy targets. Considered a pest, popular in the pet trade, and bearing plume feathers valued for hats, this species was hunted to extinction around the beginning of the 1900s.

== Scientific classification ==
The word &quot;conure&quot; is an old term that originally described members of the no longer used genus &quot;Conurus&quot;, which included members of &quot;Aratinga&quot; and &quot;Pyrrhura&quot;.

The parrot order, Psittaciformes, is a tangle of genera, many containing only one species. Parrots include about 353 species—generally grouped into two families - the Cacatuidae or cockatoos, and the Psittacidae or true parrots. The term parrot generally applies both to the entire order and to Psittacidae alone.

All members of the order Psittaciformes have a characteristic curved beak shape with the upper mandible having slight mobility in the joint with the skull and a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl—meaning they have four toes on each foot, two that face front and two that face back.

Conures and all other New World parrots are often placed in a subfamily or tribe Arinae. Internal relationships of conures are poorly understood, though it seems evident that to make them a natural grouping, the quaker parakeet, the thick-billed parrot, and &quot;Brotogeris&quot; should be included, and often are. Neotropical parrots, macaws, and other are also candidates potential for inclusion. In this scheme, &quot;conure&quot; comprises members of the genera:
* &quot;Aratinga&quot;
* &quot;Pyrrhura&quot;
* &quot;Nandayus&quot; (now an &quot;Aratinga&quot; species)
* &quot;Guarouba&quot; (Queen of Bavaria conure)
* &quot;Cyanoliseus&quot;
* &quot;Enicognathus&quot;
* &quot;Leptosittaca&quot;
* &quot;Ognorhynchus&quot;
* &quot;Conuropsis&quot;
* &quot;Rhynchopsitta&quot;: thick-billed parrot
* &quot;Myopsitta&quot;: Monk parakeet

Macaws:
* &quot;Ara&quot;
* &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot;
* &quot;Cyanopsitta&quot;
* &quot;Diopsittaca&quot;
* &quot;Orthopsittaca&quot;
* &quot;Primolius&quot;

The caiques and the hawk-headed parrot have also been proposed for inclusion, though both have a heavier build and different tail structure from traditional conures.

== Non-native colonies ==
Conures are highly adaptable to urban environments, and several non-native colonies have been observed globally. The exact origins of such colonies are generally unverifiable.

=== Hawaii ===
A colony of cherry-headed conures lives around the slopes of Diamond Head.

There also appears to be at least one colony living on the west side of the Big Island of Hawaii.

=== Seattle, Washington ===
A conure colony lives in Seward Park.

=== San Francisco, California ===
A colony of cherry-headed conures lives on Telegraph Hill, San Francisco. They are the subject of a film, &quot;The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill&quot;, based on a story by Mark Bittner. Flocks of conures can be seen and heard in many other areas of San Francisco such as the Tenderloin district.

=== Santa Clara County, California ===
Multiple colonies of cherry-headed and/or mitred conures thrive in and around Santa Clara County. In particular Sunnyvale, Cupertino (especially around the Apple Campus), and Palo Alto.

=== Los Angeles, California ===
Multiple colonies of cherry-headed conures live in the San Gabriel Valley (the suburbs northeast of Los Angeles). Subtropical U.S. cities such as Los Angeles are great environments for tropical birds because of all the tropical plants that are cultivated as ornamentals, providing them with their natural food supply. Flocks of 50 or more descend on fruit trees during their bearing season, staying for a few days and making a deafening racket. During mating season, they build nests in the palm trees that line many streets in the region.

Three species of conures (genus &quot;Aratinga&quot;) have formed non-native colonies in California. These are documented by the California Parrot Project in affiliation with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and in cooperation with the Pasadena Audubon Society.

=== Long Beach, California ===
A colony of half-moon conures has been observed in the Belmont Shore area of Long Beach, California, since the late 1980s.

=== Delray Beach, Florida ===
A least one wild pair of nandays has been spotted in downtown Delray Beach, Florida. The total number of birds in the colony is yet undetermined.

=== Quakers ===
The Quaker (which may or may not be a conure) can be found in many states. Quakers are also illegal to own in many US states, as they are known to build very large nests on powerlines (Quakers are the only parrots that build nests).

== In media ==
* A blue-crowned conure was the titular star of the family movie &quot;Paulie&quot;. The film used 14 different birds.

<doc id="333479" wikidata="Q2560704" url="?curid=333479" title="Premier of Ontario">
<text>The premier of Ontario () is the head of government of Ontario. Under the Westminster system, the premier governs with the confidence of a majority the elected Legislative Assembly; as such, the premier typically sits as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) and leads the largest party or a coalition of parties. As first minister, the premier selects ministers to form the Executive Council (provincial cabinet), and serves as its chair. Constitutionally, the Crown exercises executive power on the advice of the Executive Council, which is collectively responsible to the legislature.

Doug Ford is the 26th and current premier of Ontario. He took office on June 29, 2018, following the 2018 Ontario election where his Progressive Conservative (PC) party won a majority of seats in the Ontario Legislature.

== History ==
The position of Ontario premier evolved from the role of Joint Premier of Canada for Canada West, with John Sandfield Macdonald, the second-last joint premier of Canada becoming the first prime minister of the province of Ontario, a position that later was renamed to &quot;Premier&quot;.

J.S. Macdonald was in office from 1867 to 1871. He was elected from the provincial riding of Cornwall in the first general election of 1867 for the new province of Ontario. In addition to serving as the premier, he was also the provincial attorney general. The longest-serving premier in Ontario history was Oliver Mowat, in office from 1872 to 1896.

The position of premier was formerly written as &quot;Prime Minister of Ontario&quot; until the government of Bill Davis formally changed the title to premier. However, in French as the prime minister–premier distinction does not exist, the premier is still referred to as premier ministre (masculine) or première ministre (feminine). This directly translates to &#x27;first minister&#x27; or &#x27;prime minister&#x27; in English, with both the federal and provincial first ministers being styled the same way. 

Ontario political trends have been noted as running opposite to the trends of the federal government, with the premier and the prime minister usually coming from different types of parties. For example, in the 21st century, the federal and provincial liberal parties were only jointly in power from 2003 to 2005 and 2015 to 2018, or approximately 5 years out of 21 years cumulatively, and there was no overlap between federal and provincial conservative parties. This trend has held strongly since approximately 1950, despite Ontario being the largest province in Canada.

Most premiers have taken office between the ages of 40 and 60. With the exception of Thomas Laird Kennedy, who was 70 when he served less than a year as an interim party leader, the last premier to become premier outside of the 40-60 age range was Mitchell Hepburn, who was 38 when he became premier in 1934.

Geographically, the premier has been an MPP from Toronto, the Greater Toronto Area, or Ottawa since 2003. Generally however, premiers have come from communities throughout Ontario, including Eastern Ontario, the Lake Huron and Lake Erie coasts, the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area, and some ridings outside of southern Ontario, such as Nipissing and Sault Ste. Marie.

== Role and relationship with the legislature ==

=== Origin of the role ===
The role of premier is not defined by statute, except by reference to higher entitlement to pay under the &quot;Executive Council Act&quot;. Similarly to the federal system, the existence of a first minister is instead considered a constitutional convention. The role is a pivotal one under the Canadian system of responsible government, where government is expected to be led by someone who has the confidence of the legislature.

=== Relationship with the legislature ===
The premier and government are accountable to the legislature. The premier and executive council can exercise authority given to it by the laws created by the legislature. The flow of authority from the legislature to the executive creates the expectation that the government&#x27;s actions must obey the law. The premier is expected to answer for their actions or inactions to the legislature through the responsible government concept of fused branches of government, including through question period. As a member of cabinet, the premier is subject to the constitutional norm of individual ministerial responsibility, and is therefore expected to either be a Member of Provincial Parliament, or to quickly seek election to a seat in the legislature so that they may answer questions from the legislature in debate and question period.

=== Determination of premier ===
The premier is appointed by the lieutenant governor, who represents the head of state. The premier then presides over the Executive Council, or cabinet. The &quot;Executive Council Act&quot; stipulates that the leader of the government party is known as the &quot;Premier and President of the Council&quot;. Due to Ontario being a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, the premier is typically the leader of the party which has the most support in the Legislative Assembly at that time.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also happen if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion. Premiers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected Legislative Assembly. They typically sit as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) and lead the largest party or a coalition in the assembly. Once sworn in, the premier holds office until their resignation or is removed by the lieutenant governor after either a motion of no confidence or defeat in a general election. The premier does not have to be serving in Provincial Parliament to be selected as premier. In practice, this is highly unlikely to occur in a majority-government situation, while it can occur in a minority-government situation if the government had been struck down by its previous partners.

=== Duration of the role ===
The government exists independently of the legislature. While the legislature may be dissolved for an election, the executive council continues serving under the caretaker convention, where government ceases to make major policy decisions except in response to disaster. The premier has been a continuous role since 1914, when there was a one-week vacancy in the office between James Whitney and William Howard Hearst. In modern times, the premier serves until their successor is sworn in. There are no term limits on the role of premier, the premier may continue serving as long as they retain the confidence of the legislature.

=== Deputy Premier ===

Deputy premiers may be selected by the premier and often concurrently hold other senior roles within the cabinet. However, the role of deputy premier holds no specific formal power, and does not automatically receive any powers in the case of absence or death of a premier.

== Functions ==

=== Selection of the cabinet ===
The premier plays multiple functions in the Ontario political system, mirroring most conventions of the federal level of Canadian government. The premier has a near absolute power to determine the structure of the cabinet, to choose ministers, and to dismiss them at will, the &quot;Executive Council Act&quot; does not carry any restrictions on who can serve as a minister. The premier is constrained by certain democratic norms and constitutional conventions. For example, it expected due to individual ministerial responsibility that each minister shall be an MPP, or shall swiftly seek a seat in the legislature by participating in a by-election. It is expected that ministers are residents of the province. It is also expected that there be some level of diversity within the cabinet, on a geographic basis as much as the number of MPPs in the governing party permits. A premier will generally select ministers based on many factors including diversity, rewarding past or expected loyalty, satisfying factions within their party, creating a narrative or symbolism about choices, and primarily by who they expect can competently make decisions in a politically successful manner.

The premier also has large amounts of discretion over the creation, composition and dissolution of cabinet committees, except the Treasury Board, which has its existence and size established by statute.

=== Political decision making ===
A premier is at the centre of political decision making in Ontario. Cabinet collective responsibility (otherwise known as cabinet solidarity) is a concept that outlines that if a minister has serious issues with the direction of a government or premier, they must either accept the decision without public criticism of the premier or resign. This custom gives cabinet ministers little ability to exercise power or make decisions contrary to the will of the premier if the premier has made their position known within cabinet. While smaller decisions may often be made by individual ministers, a 1999 paper suggests anything representing policy reversal, large new policy, inter-departmental effects, politically sensitive or involving substantial financial expenditure will be brought to cabinet. The premier exercises power of political decision making through use of the Cabinet Office and the Office of the Premier. The Cabinet Office provides policy analysis and oversight over the Ontario Public Service, and the office Office of the Premier is responsible for political analysis, coordination with ministers&#x27; offices, and communications strategy. Large political decisions are usually made with proposals and discussions at a cabinet committee or cabinet level, where frank discussions on inter-departmental effects or political considerations can take in a structured way in a highly confidential environment at the centre of government. This typically follows heavy preparatory work on the part of minister&#x27;s offices and staff, as well as civil service policy analysts. This is the ultimate representation of the challenge function, where political leaders are meant to provide direction, input, and political scrutiny on professional civil service advice. Decisions made at the cabinet table may include to proceed with legislative changes, establishing a change in regulation, responding to a crisis, and allocation of scarce resources such as money, time or political capital.

The premier also plays an important part in determination of regulation. Regulations are passed via order-in-council, which are how the government exercises many powers delegated to them under laws passed by the legislature. Orders-in-council are public once signed by the lieutenant governor, but are only signed by the lieutenant governor on the advice of the premier, which has traditionally meant being passed at cabinet. In the cases of appointments, the premier and their office can have heavy involvement in the selection of a certain subset of appointments, though reforms have led to an increased level of formality through the Public Appointment Secretariat, which in some cases provides recommendations for appointments to the premier or the minister for ministerial-level appointments.

=== Communications ===
The premier is ultimately the face of their party in the province, and continues to play a role in partisan politics. The premier is also bound by individual ministerial responsibility, and is expected to present themselves to question period on an at least occasional basis. They may try to shape media framing of government priorities, do damage control on government controversies, or draw contrasts with leaders of opposition parties. The communications role has more recently expanded to encompass social media, with Premier Doug Ford launching a communications strategy of news-style direct-to-voter communications via social media. The premier sets the tone for communications through all of government, with a leader typically attempting to cultivate a &quot;brand&quot;, to varying levels of success.

=== Legislative strategy ===
The premier also makes decisions on the legislative agenda in coordination with their cabinet, deciding how to use limited time in the legislative assembly to pass desired legislation, which can have long-lasting effects even after their government is out of power. This will happen in coordination with the government house leader, who conducts inter-party negotiations if needed and manages scheduling and the government whip, who ensures compliance and attendance by members of the government&#x27;s party when votes come up. This process is especially tenuous in a minority parliament (also known as a minority government), in which the government is not unilaterally able to pass legislation in the same way they can unilaterally pass orders-in-Council, and requires other parties to support the government&#x27;s legislative agenda. The premier also has a major role to play in declaring certain votes in provincial parliament as &quot;votes of confidence&quot;, votes that will lead to the premier asking the lieutenant governor for an election if the vote fails, forcing opposition leaders to consider whether they are ready for an election. Budgets, and other funding bills are always confidence votes as are the address in reply to speech from the throne that happen at the beginning of each parliamentary session. On supply days, where the opposition controls the schedule, the opposition can introduce a confidence motion. However, importantly, the premier can cause any vote to be a confidence vote by declaring it so.

=== Constitutional advice ===
A final function of the premier is to give advice to the lieutenant governor. While advice often refers to regulation, appointments and spending, which the lieutenant governor would never refuse, there are cases in which the lieutenant governor retains reserve powers and has some discretion in matters. The premier can advise that the lieutenant governor prorogue provincial parliament, which can be a controversial way to avoid a confidence vote or parliamentary investigation in a minority parliament, and try to reset their image after a lower profile break. In extraordinary circumstances, the lieutenant governor may refuse this advice, but in general, there is great latitude given to prime ministers in requesting prorogation. The premier can advise the lieutenant governor to call an early election, an election before the required date, a move that can help a popular governing party win an election while their popularity is high, or attempt to win a majority parliament when they currently only hold a minority. This decision can be controversial in a minority government, and if a short time has passed since a recent election, and the lieutenant governor believes another leader can command confidence in parliament, they may refuse the advice of the premier, dismiss the premier, and invite the other leader to become the next premier. A gracious premier who has lost an election can also provide advice to the lieutenant governor that another leader be selected as the next premier, advising that they, the current premier, cannot command confidence in the commons, instead of waiting to fail a confidence vote.

=== Role in federalism ===
The premier plays some role in Canadian federalism, with the power to comment about federal politics or respond to federal politics, as then-Premier Kathleen Wynne did in proposing an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, which pushed the federal government into an expansion of the Canada Pension Plan. These actions can also be ineffective. Premier Doug Ford refused to participate in the carbon price regime of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but refusal to participate did not lead to any changes in the program.

In cases of changing the Canadian constitution, the premier&#x27;s influence over the provincial legislature&#x27;s priorities and schedule would play a large role in passing any constitutional amendment. Canada&#x27;s constitution has an amending formula where most changes require seven provinces representing 50 per cent of Canada&#x27;s population, and most other amendments require approval by all provinces. As a result of its high population, Ontario has an effective veto on any constitutional change unless Quebec supports it, which is highly unlikely due to Quebec&#x27;s historical refusal to legitimize a constitutional system which does not give them a full veto over constitutional change.

As first minister, the premier also acts as Ontario&#x27;s representative to the First Ministers&#x27; conferences and Council of the Federation, meeting with other Canadian first ministers to discuss issues where inter-provincial co-operation may be required or beneficial.

The premier through cabinet or through consultation with the attorney general is finally likely to approve any intergovernmental lawsuits of the Government of Ontario against the federal government. For example, the Ontario government recently was involved in a court case regarding the constitutionality of the carbon pricing regime.

The role of federalism has also evolved, with areas of provincial responsibility now having federal dollars backing them, leading to a more integrated role on whether premiers will accept the conditions attached to those dollars. Such an issue was pertinent in 2021, where Ontario is the sole province not to sign on to a vastly expanded federal financial commitment under its childcare accords.

=== Minister ===
The premier, as well as other ministers, can hold multiple portfolios. The premier typically also holds the portfolio for intergovernmental affairs, though exceptions may exist, with Dalton McGuinty having three ministers who served at different times when he himself was not, and premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves, who never elected to hold the roles during their tenure. Even while another person may hold that ministerial title, the premier is still likely to serve a major intergovernmental affairs role through their presence at first ministers conferences. This role typically has a mostly domestic role, but can also play an international one.

Premiers may also choose to hold another ministry title, whether for symbolic reasons or for treating the ministry as a serious priority. While Leslie Frost served for a short time as the minister for the Department of Economics (functionally Minister of Finance), a premier is unlikely to take on a more senior challenging portfolio such as finance, health or education due to their complexity and time demands. Smaller or less complex ministries are more likely to be seen, such as could be seen on the federal level with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau taking on the federal cabinet position of Minister of Youth. In Ontario, examples of taking more junior files include Kathleen Wynne serving concurrently as Premier and Minister of Agriculture and Food for one year. Dalton McGuinty took on the role of Minister of Research and Innovation for two years, and as Minister of Economic Development for a short time during the great recession of 2008. These instances are still an exception and not the rule. Since Frost&#x27;s short time in his ministry, no other premier has taken on a ministerial role except for that of intergovernmental affairs. Prior to Frost, relatively few ministers took on cabinet roles, with the informality of the cabinet structure likely permitting more informal involvement in areas of interest. A notable exception seems to be premier George Stewart Henry, who took on the contemporarily important role of Minister of Highways, and also served a short time as Minister of Finance.

== Cabinet Office ==
The Cabinet Office is the ministry that directly supports the premier, serving the same function provincially as the Privy Council Office does federally. The Cabinet Office plays a coordination role, attempting to harmonize procedures between ministries where possible, as well as monitoring key performance indicators and departmental plans.

The Cabinet Office also includes administrative support for a number of committees:
* Priorities and Planning Committee
* Cabinet Committee on Emergency Management
* Treasury Board / Management Board of Cabinet
* Legislation and Regulations Committee
* Health, Education and Social Policy Committee
* Jobs and Economic Policy Committee

== Premier&#x27;s Office ==
The Office of the Premier is the partisan centre of government, providing political analysis, communications strategy, issues management, media monitoring and other functions for the benefit of the Premier. The office is headed by the Chief of Staff to the Premier, and will typically also have senior advisors, stakeholder relations specialists, issues management staff, policy advisors, logistical and operations staff for travel, media specialists, legislative affairs staff, and public appointments staff. The size of the office is typically something the premier has wide latitude to determine and place in the provincial budget, as staff are not part of the public service, and are instead hired as partisans, and do work that is partisan in nature. Total spending in the portfolio is approximately $3 million per year and typically encompasses about 75 staff. The office is also the cost centre for a parliamentary assistant to the premier, if the premier chooses to have one. The hiring and firing decisions within this office are generally at the discretion of the Premier, unlike the civil service.

== Pay and benefits ==
The salary of the premier is determined by their pay as an MPP, if they hold a seat in the legislature, which is governed by the &quot;Legislative Assembly Act&quot;. In addition, the &quot;Executive Council Act&quot; establishes a premium of 79.3% above the MPP salary, 37% for their role as Premier and the remaining 42.3% if they retain the portfolio of Intergovernmental Affairs. This leads to a total of approximately $209,000. Under the Legislative Assembly Act, the Premier would also be permitted to draw benefits with regard to car travel in Toronto, travel to and from home, and compensation for an apartment in Toronto if they do not already reside within 50 kilometers of the city. The Premier, like other MPPs, is not entitled to any pension based on their service.

The premier, as a member of the Executive Council, is entitled to use the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; while in office, but is not sworn into the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, and therefore unlike federal cabinet ministers, provincial premiers are not entitled to use that honorific after they cease to serve on the Executive Council.

== Life after office ==
Most premiers cease to be premier while still in their working life. As a result, premiers have many options for what to do after. In some circumstances, they may stay on as an MPP if they won their seat but no longer had the confidence of the legislative assembly. Kathleen Wynne served one full parliamentary term after her premiership. Many others turn to consulting work, work on corporate or NGO boards, or in academia. Another option is to pursue politics in another instance. Bob Rae went on to serve as a federal Liberal MP, and interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Doug Ford, while a current premier, is a former Toronto mayoral candidate, and some, including a CBC journalist have speculated it may be a position of interest if provincial politics are unfavourable to him, speculating to an extent they thought was worthy asking in an interview.

<doc id="333481" wikidata="Q291749" url="?curid=333481" title="Rose Mofford">
<text>Rose Mofford (née Perica; June 10, 1922September 15, 2016) was an American civil servant and politician of the Democratic Party who served as the 18th governor of Arizona from 1988 to 1991. Her career in state government spanned 51 years, beginning as a secretary and working her way up the ranks to become the state&#x27;s first female secretary of state, serving from 1977 to 1988, and the state&#x27;s first female governor.

==Early life==
Mofford was born Rose Perica in Globe, Arizona, on June 10, 1922, the youngest of six children. Her parents, Frances (Oberstar) and John Perica, had immigrated to the United States from Croatia, then part of Austria-Hungary. The first female class president in the history of Globe High School, she had success in both academics and athletics. She played basketball and was an All-American softball player.

She graduated in 1939 as class valedictorian and, based upon her father&#x27;s advice, turned down an opportunity to play professional basketball with the All American Red Heads.

==Career==
Following high school, Mofford began her career as an administrative assistant for State Treasurer Joe Hunt. She was eighteen when she started working for him, and earned a salary of $125 a month. Two years later, when Hunt was promoted to the Arizona Tax Commission, Mofford followed her boss to the new position. In 1945, she left the Tax Commission and became business manager for &quot;Arizona Highways&quot;, a state magazine. Mofford returned to the Tax Commission in 1947 as executive secretary. Following Hunt&#x27;s retirement in 1960, new commissioner Thad Moore fired Mofford, saying &quot;we felt it was better to have a man in that job.&quot; Following her dismissal from the Tax Commission, Mofford was hired as an executive secretary by Secretary of State Wesley Bolin. She remained in the Secretary of State&#x27;s office until 1975, when she became assistant director of the State Revenue Department (formerly the Tax Commission).

===Secretary of State of Arizona===

When Governor Raúl Castro announced his resignation to become Ambassador to Argentina, Secretary Bolin ascended to the governorship. Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor; the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession to the governorship if retaining office by election. Bolin in turn appointed Mofford to serve the remainder of his term as Secretary of State.

Bolin died in office on March 4, 1978. Although Mofford was Secretary of State, she held that post by appointment, so she could not ascend to the governorship; instead, Attorney General Bruce Babbitt became governor. At the end of the term she ran for a full term as Secretary of State and won. She was reelected in 1982 and 1986. In 1982 she won the election by nearly a 2–1 ratio, and won unopposed in 1986. Mofford became known in the state capital as the friendly woman with a beehive hairdo, and her office gained a reputation as an efficient operation. She was punctual, answering her own phone and replying directly to her mail. In addition to her state position, she served from 1982 until 1983 as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.

In traditionally Republican Arizona, Democrat Mofford was well-liked by members of both parties. She was a bipartisan leader who often reached across the political aisle.

===Governor of Arizona===
Governor Evan Mecham was impeached on February 8, 1988. Per the Arizona Constitution, his powers were suspended and Mofford became acting governor. While most observers complimented her on the job she performed, Mecham objected to Mofford replacing the one state department head that he had appointed. Mecham was convicted on two of four articles in the impeachment trial and removed from office on April 4, 1988. Mofford was sworn in as Governor for the balance of Mecham&#x27;s term, despite the fact that Article V, Section 2, of the Arizona Constitution, then provided that all state office holders must be male persons. In an election held on November 8, 1988, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 103, eliminating the gender-specific qualification for office.

Mofford was thought to have had a rocky transition to the governorship at first, as she faced a collapse of the real-estate market and a high deficit left over from the previous administration.

Mofford&#x27;s primary goal as governor was to return stability to Arizona. She was called &quot;the healing governor&quot;, and some thought it was her duty as governor to repair the state. Mofford also received this nickname due to her ability to ease racial division in Arizona, which some considered a problem under Mecham. Her efforts were widely held as providing a calming effect following the tumultuous impeachment and recall proceedings of her predecessor. State Senate Democratic leader Alfredo Gutierrez said of her actions, &quot;What she did was reinvest the system with dignity and honor.&quot; During her time in office, Mofford was one of only three female governors in the country.

Mofford fought for higher bonding limits and increased funding for mental health programs in Arizona. She strongly opposed English-only instruction in Arizona schools and considered herself an advocate for civil liberties. Known for her fondness for athletics, Mofford created a funding mechanism to keep Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cactus League in the state. She created the Governor&#x27;s Alliance Against Drugs, the Governor&#x27;s Youth Commission Against Drugs, and managed the formation of the state&#x27;s first Drug Prevention Resource Center. The governor formed a task force to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic statewide, as a response to its rising national concern; during this time, the HIV/AIDS crisis was an issue thought to be ignored by politicians throughout the country. Mofford tried to increase political leadership opportunities for women in the state, appointing more minorities and women to commissions, boards, and courts than any other past Arizona governor.

Mofford advocated for the re-establishment of Martin Luther King Day as a paid state holiday; this holiday had been rescinded under her predecessor. The holiday was eventually reinstated by popular vote in 1992 after she had left office.

In 1988, Mofford stated her opposition to a bill banning abortions in the state (except in extreme cases), claiming it was unconstitutional. The proposed legislation was rejected by the state legislature by one vote.

Mofford enjoyed a high level of popularity in the state, but her popularity decreased when she commuted two murder sentences in 1989; convicted murderers James Hamm and Carl Kummerlowe were able to attain early parole under her commutations, which she later tried to rescind.

In early 1990, Mofford announced that she had decided not to run for election to a full four-year term. She was succeeded by Fife Symington. Mofford told reporters in 1990 that she hoped to be remembered &quot;as a caring governor, because I cared about everybody in Arizona&quot;.

== Awards ==
Mofford received the Distinguished Public Servant and Dedicated Humanitarian Award from St. Jude&#x27;s Research Hospital. In 1988, she won Valley Leadership&#x27;s Outstanding Woman of the Year Award. She was a recipient of the Arizona Heritage Award in 2004.

She was honored as an Arizona Historymaker from The Historical League in 1999. Former Phoenix mayor Skip Rimsza established June 10 as &quot;Rose Mofford Day&quot;. She was a member of the Arizona Softball Hall of Fame, and municipal softball fields are named in her honor in both Butler and Phoenix.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Mofford dedicated her time to civic and charitable activities. She served as chair of the campaign committee of Attorney General Terry Goddard&#x27;s unsuccessful 2010 election bid for Governor of Arizona. She worked with former lawmaker Leo Corbet to help people in Arizona get organ transplants under the state health insurance. She often visited residence homes for the elderly, and washed, sorted, and donated clothes to homeless shelters until she was 91.

Even after she left office, Mofford was considered a mentor to several Arizona politicians. She would often use her influence in politics to help others rise up in the ranks. Former Senator Dennis DeConcini remembered asking Mofford for advice after taking a job as a gubernatorial staffer. Mofford would make calls for him which &quot;opened a lot of doors&quot; according to DeConcini.

In the 2004 US presidential election, Mofford was on the Democratic slate of prospective electors for Arizona supporting the presidential campaign of then-US Senator John Kerry. Arizona was won by incumbent President George W. Bush that year.

In a 2010 interview, Mofford said, &quot;I attribute my success in life to my roots, religion, and my Rolodex&quot;. She started the Rolodex when she began working in government in 1940, eventually compiling 4,000 contacts.

==Personal life==
In 1957, Rose Perica married Thorald Robert &quot;Lefty&quot; Mofford, a captain with the Phoenix Police Department. The couple divorced after a decade, but remained friends until his death in 1983; Rose Mofford retained Lefty&#x27;s surname. They did not have children, and Rose Mofford never remarried.

Mofford identified as a devout Catholic. She considered religion to be a driving force in her success both in politics and as a leader. She contributed to the Missionaries of Charity, a foundation created by Mother Teresa. Her commitment to her faith was thought to have made her more popular among Arizonians.

===Death===
On August 31, 2016, after falling at her home, Mofford was admitted to a hospice. She died there on September 15, 2016, at the age of 94. After Mofford&#x27;s death, Governor Doug Ducey said that &quot;rising through the ranks of state government to our state&#x27;s top office, she [Mofford] shattered a once-thought-unbreakable glass ceiling and served as an unparalleled role model to many&quot;.

===Grave marker===

Rose Mofford is buried at Saint Francis Catholic Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2017, a new grave marker was unveiled for Mofford&#x27;s grave, which includes among other things images of her meeting Pope John Paul II in 1987 and Mother Teresa in 1989; those meetings were some of her favorite times as governor.

<text>Robert Brown (21 December 1773 – 10 June 1858) was a Scottish botanist and paleobotanist who made important contributions to botany largely through his pioneering use of the microscope. His contributions include one of the earliest detailed descriptions of the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic streaming; the observation of Brownian motion; early work on plant pollination and fertilisation, including being the first to recognise the fundamental difference between gymnosperms and angiosperms; and some of the earliest studies in palynology. He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy, notably erecting a number of plant families that are still accepted today; and numerous Australian plant genera and species, the fruit of his exploration of that continent with Matthew Flinders.

Robert Brown was born in Montrose, Scotland on 21 December 1773, in a house that existed on the site where Montrose Library currently stands. He was the son of James Brown, a minister in the Scottish Episcopal Church with Jacobite convictions so strong that in 1788 he defied his church&#x27;s decision to give allegiance to George III. His mother was Helen Brown &quot;née&quot; Taylor, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. As a child Brown attended the local Grammar School (now called Montrose Academy), then Marischal College at Aberdeen, but withdrew in his fourth year when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1790. His father died late the following year.

Brown enrolled to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but developed an interest in botany and ended up spending more of his time on the latter than the former. He attended the lectures of John Walker; made botanical expeditions into the Scottish Highlands, alone or with nurserymen such as George Don; and wrote out meticulous botanical descriptions of the plants he collected. He also began corresponding with and collecting for William Withering, one of the foremost British botanists of his day. Highlights for Brown during this period include his discovery of a new species of grass, &quot;Alopecurus alpinus&quot;, and his first botanical paper, &quot;&quot;, read to the Edinburgh Natural History Society in January 1792 but not published in print in Brown&#x27;s lifetime.
Brown dropped out of his medical course in 1793. Late in 1794 he enlisted in the Fifeshire Fencibles, and his regiment was posted to Ireland shortly after. In June 1795 he was appointed Surgeon&#x27;s Mate. His regiment saw very little action and he had a good deal of leisure time, almost all of which he spent on botany. He was frustrated by his itinerant lifestyle, which prevented him from building his personal library and specimen collection as he would have liked, and cut him off from the most important herbaria and libraries.

During this period Brown was especially interested in cryptogams, and these would be the subject of Brown&#x27;s first, albeit unattributed, publication. Brown began a correspondence with James Dickson, and by 1796 was sending him specimens and descriptions of mosses. Dickson incorporated Brown&#x27;s descriptions into his &quot;Fasciculi plantarum cryptogamicarum britanniae&quot;, with Brown&#x27;s permission but without any attribution.

By 1800 Brown was firmly established amongst Irish botanists and was corresponding with a number of British and foreign botanists, including Withering, Dickson, James Edward Smith and José Correia da Serra. He had been nominated to the Linnean Society of London; had contributed to Dickson&#x27;s &quot;Fasciculi&quot;; was acknowledged in a number of other works; and had had a species of algae, &quot;Conferva brownii&quot; (now &quot;Aegagropila linnaei&quot;) named after him by Lewis Weston Dillwyn. He had also begun experimenting with microscopy. However, as an army surgeon stationed in Ireland there seemed little prospect of him attracting the notice of those who could offer him a career in botany.

==To Australia on the &quot;Investigator&quot;==
In 1798 Brown heard that Mungo Park had withdrawn from a proposed expedition into the interior of New Holland (now Australia), leaving a vacancy for a naturalist. At Brown&#x27;s request, Correia wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though George Caley was sent to New South Wales as a botanical collector for Banks. In 1800, however, Matthew Flinders put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders&#x27; proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately.

===Preparations===
Brown was told to expect to sail at the end of 1800, only a few weeks after being offered the position. A succession of delays meant the voyage did not get under way until July 1801. Brown spent much of the meantime preparing for the voyage by studying Banks&#x27; Australian plant specimens and copying out notes and descriptions for use on the voyage.

Though Brown&#x27;s brief was to collect scientific specimens of all sorts, he was told to give priority to plants, insects, and birds, and to treat other fields, such as geology, as secondary pursuits. In addition to Brown, the scientific staff comprised the renowned botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer; the gardener Peter Good, whose task was to collect live plants and viable seed for the use of Kew Gardens; the miner John Allen, appointed as mineralogist; the landscape artist William Westall; and the astronomer John Crosley, who would fall ill on the voyage out and leave the ship at the Cape of Good Hope, being belatedly replaced at Sydney by James Inman. Brown was given authority over Bauer and Good, both of whom were instructed to give any specimens they might collect to Brown, rather than forming separate collections. Both men would provide enthusiastic and hard-working companions for Brown, and thus Brown&#x27;s specimen collections contain material collected by all three men.

===Desertas, Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope===
HMS &quot;Investigator&quot; sailed from London on 18 July. They made brief landfalls at Bugio Island (Desertas Islands) and Madeira, but Brown was disappointed to collect almost nothing of note from either site. They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 October, staying a little over two weeks, during which time Brown made extensive botanical expeditions and climbed Table Mountain at least twice. Many years later he would write to William Henry Harvey, who was considering emigrating there, that &quot;some of the pleasantest botanizing he ever had was on Devil&#x27;s Mountain, near Cape Town, and he thought I could not pitch on a more delightful field of study.&quot; Amongst the plants collected at the Cape were two new species of &quot;Serruria&quot; (Proteaceae), &quot;S. foeniculacea&quot; and &quot;S. flagellaris&quot;.

===Australia===
&quot;Investigator&quot; arrived in King George Sound in what is now Western Australia in December 1801. For three and a half years Brown did intensive botanic research in Australia, collecting about 3400 species, of which about 2000 were previously unknown. A large part of this collection was lost when was wrecked &quot;en route&quot; to England.

Brown remained in Australia until May 1805. He then returned to Britain where he spent the next five years working on the material he had gathered. He published numerous species descriptions; in Western Australia alone he is the author of nearly 1200 species. The list of major Australian genera that he named includes: Livistona, Triodia, Eriachne, Caladenia, Isolepis, Prasophyllum, Pterostylis, Patersonia, Conostylis, Thysanotus, Pityrodia, Hemigenia, Lechenaultia, Eremophila, Logania, Dryandra, Isopogon, Grevillea, Petrophile, Telopea, Leptomeria, Jacksonia, Leucopogon, Stenopetalum, Ptilotus, Sclerolaena and Rhagodia.

==Subsequent career==

In early 1809 he read his paper called &quot;On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae&quot; to the Linnean Society of London. This was subsequently published in March 1810 as &quot;On the Proteaceae of Jussieu&quot;. It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in Joseph Knight&#x27;s 1809 publication &quot;On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae&quot;.

In 1810, he published the results of his collecting in his famous &quot;Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen&quot;, the first systematic account of the Australian flora. Over half of New Zealand&#x27;s orchid genera were first described in the work. That year, he succeeded Jonas C. Dryander as Sir Joseph Banks&#x27; librarian, and on Banks&#x27; death in 1820 Brown inherited his library and herbarium. This was transferred to the British Museum in 1827, and Brown was appointed Keeper of the Banksian Botanical Collection.

In 1818 he published &quot;Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo&quot;. In 1822, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1827 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, three years later he became associated member. When the institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 Brown joined as foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

Brown was one of the seven founding members of the Royal Geographical Society which formed on 16 July 1830.

In a paper read to the Linnean society in 1831 and published in 1833, Brown named the cell nucleus. The nucleus had been observed before, perhaps as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek, and Franz Bauer had noted and drawn it as a regular feature of plant cells in 1802, but it was Brown who gave it the name it bears to this day (while giving credit to Bauer&#x27;s drawings). Neither Bauer nor Brown thought the nucleus to be universal, and Brown thought it to be primarily confined to Monocotyledons.

After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first Keeper of the Botanical Department, remaining so until his death. He was succeeded by John Joseph Bennett.

He served as president of the Linnean Society from 1849 to 1853.

Brown died at 17 Dean Street, Soho Square in London, on 10 June 1858. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Legacy==
Brown&#x27;s name is commemorated in the Australian herb genus &quot;Brunonia&quot; as well as numerous Australian species such as &quot;Eucalyptus brownii&quot;, &quot;Banksia brownii&quot; and the moss Brown&#x27;s Tetrodontium Moss (&quot;Tetrodontium brownianum&quot;), a species which he discovered growing at Roslin near Edinburgh whilst still a student. The plant can still be found at the site of its discovery. Brown&#x27;s River, south of Hobart, upon the banks of which he collected botanical samples, was named in his honour. In South Australia, Mount Brown and Point Brown (near Smoky Bay) were named for him by Flinders during the &quot;Investigator&quot; expedition. Mount Brown in British Columbia, Canada was named for him by David Douglas.

In 1938 the London County Council commemorated Brown, as well as botanists Joseph Banks and David Don, and meetings of the Linnean Society, with a rectangular stone plaque at 32 Soho Square.

A small New Zealand tree Pisonia brunoniana was named in recognition of him, and Cape Brown (Greenland) was named by William Scoresby (1789–1857) in 1822 in his honour. Specimens collected by Brown are cared for at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.
== Brownian motion ==
In 1827, while examining grains of pollen of the plant &quot;Clarkia pulchella&quot; suspended in water under a microscope, Brown observed minute particles, now known to be amyloplasts (starch organelles) and spherosomes (lipid organelles), ejected from the pollen grains, executing a continuous jittery motion. He then observed the same motion in particles of inorganic matter, enabling him to rule out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related. Although Brown did not provide a theory to explain the motion, the phenomenon is now known as Brownian motion.

In recent years controversy arose over whether Brown&#x27;s microscopes were sufficient to reveal phenomena of this order. Brown&#x27;s discoveries were denied in a brief paper in 1991. Shortly thereafter, in an illustrated presentation, British microscopist Brian J. Ford presented to Inter Micro 1991 in Chicago a reprise of the demonstration using Brown&#x27;s original microscope. His video sequences substantiated Brown&#x27;s observations, suggesting Brown&#x27;s microscope was sufficient to allow him to see motion. Physicist Phil Pearle and colleagues presented a detailed discussion of Brown&#x27;s original observations of particles from pollen of &quot;Clarkia pulchella&quot; undergoing Brownian motion, including the relevant history, botany, microscopy, and physics.

<doc id="333487" wikidata="Q834038" url="?curid=333487" title="Gennadiy Nikonov">
<text>Gennadiy Nikolaevich Nikonov (; August 11, 1950 – May 14, 2003) was a Russian firearm engineer. Some of his most famous accomplishments were as the designer of the AN-94 assault rifle, and the &quot;straight-back bolt.&quot; Nikonov held 44 Copyright Certificates, and was awarded the titles of &quot;The Best Designer of the Company&quot; and &quot;The Best Designer of the Ministry.&quot; In memory of the outstanding designer, a memorial plaque on the building design and weapons center of &quot;Izhmash&quot; (2003), and at the place of his burial (2007).

== Early life and education ==

Nikonov was born in Izhevsk. His father and mother were employed at Izhmash, a Soviet arms factory. His father was a mechanic. Nikonov graduated from technical school in 1968. At Izhmash, he took evening classes. In 1975 he graduated from the Izhevsk Mechanical Institute certified as a gun engineer.

== Design career ==

He started work at Izhmash in the Department of the Chief Arms Designer. His first position was as a technician. In technical school, Nikonov became obsessed with underwater rifles. He won his first professional recognition by designing a trigger mechanism for an underwater rifle.

He designed various rifles, including air guns and sporting firearms. One of the most praised was the stylish, accurate &quot;Izjubr&quot; (Buck Deer) carbine – a limited edition luxury weapon. Nikonov was appointed as a senior project engineer to design single-shot bolt-action rifles and fully automatic weapons. In this assignment he patented a number of mechanisms and components. One of the most significant was the &quot;straight-pull bolt,&quot; first used in a winter biathlon target rifle.

Nikonov also worked on research projects. In the middle 1970s he entered a post-graduate Ph.D course. From 1980 to 1985 he worked on projects for the Soviet Ministry for Defense Industry. Examples of his innovation include his twin-barreled machine gun and the &quot;blow back shifted pulse (BBSP)&quot; used on the AN-94. It is said that his high quality and quantity of work helped him advance to higher positions at work.

===Nikonov machine gun===
The weapon was developed on Nikonov&#x27;s own initiative, from work connected with competitions and technical tasks. The weapon has no bolt, but a stationary breech and movable barrels, each with its own gas cylinders and pistons connected to the adjacent barrel. Upon firing one barrel, the next one is forced backwards, and thus causes the next barrel to move forward. Firing operates a feeding device that channels rounds into the barrels, with the spent cartridges being ejected from both sides. The barrels move back and forth the full length of the cartridge. The double-barreled design, in combination with the shortest possible stroke, allows for a high rate of fire at more than 3,000 rounds per minute. The prototype is now located the M.T. Kalashnikov museum in Izhevsk.

==Personal life==
He was married and had two sons, Nikolay and Yuri. Tatiana, Nikonov&#x27;s wife, works as an arms designer in the same bureau.

<doc id="333488" wikidata="Q867447" url="?curid=333488" title="Linnean Society of London">
<text>The Linnean Society of London is a learned society dedicated to the study and dissemination of information concerning natural history, evolution, and taxonomy. It possesses several important biological specimens, manuscript and literature collections, and publishes academic journals and books on plant and animal biology. The society also awards a number of prestigious medals and prizes.

A product of the 18th-century enlightenment, the society is the oldest extant biological society in the world and is historically important as the venue for the first public presentation of the theory of evolution by natural selection on 1 July 1858.

The former patron of the society was Queen Elizabeth II. Honorary members include: King Charles III of the United Kingdom, Emeritus Emperor Akihito of Japan, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden (both of the latter have active interests in natural history), and the eminent naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.

==History==
===Founding===



The Linnean Society was founded in 1788 by botanist Sir James Edward Smith. The society takes its name from the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, the &#x27;father of taxonomy&#x27;, who systematised biological classification through his binomial nomenclature. (He was known as Carl von Linné after his ennoblement, hence the spelling &#x27;Linnean&#x27;, rather than &#x27;Linnaean&#x27;.) The society had a number of minor name variations before it gained its Royal Charter on 26 March 1802, when the name became fixed as &quot;The Linnean Society of London&quot;. As a newly incorporated society, it comprised 228 fellows. It is the oldest extant natural history society in the world. Throughout its history the society has been a non-political and non-sectarian institution, existing solely for the furtherance of natural history.

The inception of the society was the direct result of the purchase by Sir James Edward Smith of the specimen, book and correspondence collections of Carl Linnaeus. When the collection was offered for sale by Linnaeus&#x27;s heirs, Smith was urged to acquire it by Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent botanist and president of the Royal Society. Five years after this purchase Banks gave Smith his full support in founding the Linnean Society, and became one of its first Honorary Members. 

===Prominent members===
The society has numbered many prominent scientists amongst its fellows. One such was the botanist Robert Brown, who was librarian, and later president (1849–1853); he named the cell nucleus and discovered Brownian motion. In 1854, Charles Darwin was elected a fellow; he is undoubtedly the most illustrious scientist ever to appear on the membership rolls of the society. Another famous fellow was biologist Thomas Huxley, who would later gain the nickname &quot;Darwin&#x27;s bulldog&quot; for his outspoken defence of Darwin and evolution. Men notable in other walks of life have also been fellows of the society, including the physician Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination, the Arctic explorers Sir John Franklin and Sir James Clark Ross, colonial administrator and founder of Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Lord Aberdeen.

===Biological evolution and the society===
The first public exposition of the &#x27;Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection&#x27;, arguably the greatest single leap of progress made in biology, was presented to a meeting of the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. At this meeting a joint presentation of papers by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace was made, sponsored by Joseph Hooker and Charles Lyell, as neither author could be present.

The society&#x27;s connection with evolution remained strong into the 20th century. Sir Edward Poulton, who was president in 1912–1916, was a great defender of natural selection, and was the first biologist to recognise the importance of frequency-dependent selection.

===Female fellows===
In 1904, the society elected its first female fellows, following a number of years of tireless campaigning by the botanist Marian Farquharson. Whilst the society&#x27;s council was reluctant to admit women, the wider fellowship was more supportive; only 17% voted against the proposal. Among the first to benefit from this were the ornithologist and photographer Emma Louisa Turner, Lilian J. Veley, a microbiologist, Annie Lorrain Smith, a lichenologist and mycologist, Gulielma Lister, a mycologist, and Margaret Jane Benson, a paleobotanist, all formally admitted on 19 January 1905.

Also numbered in the first cohort of women to be elected in 1904 were: the paleobotanist, and later pioneer of family planning, Marie Stopes, the philanthropist Constance Sladen, founder of the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust and Alice Laura Embleton (1876–1960), biologist, zoologist and suffragist, who had been one of the earliest women to deliver a paper to the society on 4 Jun 1903. Overall, 15 out of 16 women nominated in 1904 were elected to the society. Marian Farquharson was not admitted, having been &quot;shamefully blackballed&quot; as the society now states, although she was finally admitted in 1908.

The painting &quot;Admission of Lady Fellows&quot; by James Sant R.A., which hangs on the upper staircase, shows the eleven women signing the society&#x27;s Book of Admission and Obligation on 19 January 1905. The painting was altered to remove the figures of T R R Stebbing, the Zoological Secretary, and his wife, Mary Anne, from the right hand side sometime before the painting was presented to the society in 1919.

The first female president of the society was Irene Manton (1973 to 1976), who pioneered the biological use of electron microscopy. Her work revealed the structure of the flagellum and cilia, which are central to many systems of cellular motility.

===Present interests===
Recent years have seen an increased interest within the society in issues of biodiversity conservation. This was highlighted by the inception in 2015 of an annual award, the John Spedan Lewis Medal, specifically honouring persons making significant and innovative contributions to conservation.

==Locations==
The society has had a number of different homes, initially meeting in Marlborough Coffee House (1788), before moving to Panton Square in 1795, then Gerrard Street, Soho in 1805, and Soho Square in 1821. Since 1857 the society has been based at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London; an address it shares with a number of other learned societies: the Geological Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In April 1939 the threat of war obliged the society to relocate the Linnean collections out of London to Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, where they remained for the duration of World War II. This move was facilitated by the 12th Duke of Bedford, a Fellow of the Linnean Society himself. Three thousand of the most precious items from the library collections were packed up and evacuated to Oxford; the country house of librarian Warren Royal Dawson provided a refuge for the society&#x27;s records.

==Membership==
Fellowship is open to both professional scientists and to amateur naturalists who have shown active interest in natural history and allied disciplines. Having authored relevant publications is an advantage, but not a necessity, for election. Prior to November 2024, fellowship required nomination by at least one fellow, and election by a minimum of two-thirds of those electors voting. Following election, new fellows had to be formally admitted, in person at a meeting of the society, before they were able to vote in society elections. Admission took the form of signing the membership book, and thereby agreeing to an obligation to abide by the statutes of the society. Following this the new fellow was taken by the hand by the president, who recited a formula of admission to the fellowship.

As of November of 2024, applications for fellowship will be considered by a newly instigated &#x27;Fellowship Committee&#x27;. Existing fellows may make a formal objection to the admittance of any prospective fellow. Election to fellowship is via an application supported by named referees. The fellowship committee reports to the council of the society on the suitability of applicants. After approval at a society meeting, applicants will be deemed elected as fellows. Fellows may employ the post-nominal letters &#x27;FLS&#x27;.

Other forms of membership exist: &#x27;Associate&#x27; (or &#x27;ALS&#x27;), for supporters of the society who do not wish to submit to the formal election process for fellowship, and &#x27;Student Associate&#x27;, for those registered as students at a place of tertiary education. Associate members may apply for election to the fellowship at any time.

Finally, there are three types of membership that are prestigious and strictly limited in number: &#x27;Fellow &quot;honoris causa&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;Foreign&#x27;, and lastly, &#x27;Honorary&#x27;. These forms of membership are bestowed following election by the fellowship at the annual Anniversary Meeting in May.

==Meetings==
Meetings have historically been, and continue to be, the main justification for the society&#x27;s existence. Meetings are venues for people of like interests to exchange information, talk about scientific and literary concerns, exhibit specimens, and listen to lectures. Today, meetings are held in the evening and also at lunchtime. Most are open to the general public as well as to members, and the majority are offered without charge for admission.

On or near 24 May, traditionally regarded as the birthday of Carl Linnaeus, the Anniversary Meeting is held. This is for fellows and guests only, it includes ballots for membership of the council of the society and the awarding of medals. On 22 May 2020, for the first time in its history, the Anniversary Meeting was held online via videotelephony. This was due to restrictions on public gatherings imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Medals and prizes==
The Linnean Society of London aims to promote the study of all aspects of the biological sciences, with particular emphasis on evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity, and sustainability. Through awarding medals and grants, the society acknowledges and encourages excellence in all of these fields.

The following medals and prizes are awarded by the Linnean Society:
*Linnean Medal, established 1888, awarded annually to alternately a botanist or a zoologist or (as has been common since 1958) to one of each in the same year.
*Darwin-Wallace Medal, first awarded in 1908, for major advances in evolutionary biology.
*H. H. Bloomer Award, established 1963 from a legacy by the amateur naturalist Harry Howard Bloomer, awarded to &quot;an amateur naturalist who has made an important contribution to biological knowledge&quot;
*Trail-Crisp Award, established in 1966 from the amalgamation of two previous awards – both dating to 1910 – awarded &quot;in recognition of an outstanding contribution to biological microscopy that has been published in the UK&quot;.
*Bicentenary Medal, established 1978, on the 200th anniversary of the death of Linnaeus, &quot;in recognition of work done by a person under the age of 40 years&quot;.
*Jill Smythies Award, established 1986, awarded for botanical illustrations.

* John Spedan Lewis Medal, established 2015, awarded to &quot;an individual who is making a significant and innovative contribution to conservation&quot;.
* Sir David Attenborough Award for Fieldwork, established in 2015.

==Collections==

Linnaeus&#x27; botanical and zoological collections were purchased in 1783 by Sir James Edward Smith, the first president of the society, and are now held in London by the society. The collections include 14,000 plants, 158 fish, 1,564 shells, 3,198 insects, 1,600 books and 3,000 letters and documents. They may be viewed by appointment and there is a monthly tour of the collections.

Smith&#x27;s own plant collection of 27,185 dried specimens, together with his correspondence and book collection, is also held by the society.
Other notable holdings of the society include the notebooks and journals of Alfred Russel Wallace and the paintings of plants and animals made by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829) in Nepal.

In December 2014, the society&#x27;s specimen, library, and archive collections were granted designated status by the Arts Council England, recognising collections of national and international importance (one of only 152 institutions so recognised as of 2020).

==Publications==
The Linnean Society began its extensive series of publications on 13 August 1791, when Volume I of &quot;Transactions of the Linnean Society of London&quot; was produced. Over the following centuries the society published a number of different journals, some of which specialised in more specific subject areas, whilst earlier publications were discontinued.

Those still in publication include: the &quot;Biological Journal of the Linnean Society&quot;, which covers the evolutionary biology of all organisms, &quot;Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society&quot;, which focuses on plant sciences, and &quot;Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society&quot; focusing on animal systematics and evolution. In 2022, the society launched the &quot;Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society&quot;, its first fully open access scholarly publication. &quot;The Linnean&quot; is a biannual newsletter. It contains commentary on recent activities and events, articles on history and science, and occasional biographies/obituaries of people connected to the Linnean Society; it also includes book reviews, reference material and correspondence. The society also publishes books and &quot;Synopses of the British Fauna&quot;, a series of field-guides.

Previously, an electronic magazine for Fellows, &quot;Pulse&quot;, was produced quarterly. This ceased publication in 2021.

<text>In computer science, primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types, although the specific representations vary. More generally, &quot;primitive data types&quot; may refer to the standard data types built into a programming language (built-in types). Data types which are not primitive are referred to as &quot;derived&quot; or &quot;composite&quot;.

Primitive types are almost always value types, but composite types may also be value types.

==Common primitive data types==

The most common primitive types are those used and supported by computer hardware, such as integers of various sizes, floating-point numbers, and Boolean logical values. Operations on such types are usually quite efficient. Primitive data types which are native to the processor have a one-to-one correspondence with objects in the computer&#x27;s memory, and operations on these types are often the fastest possible in most cases. Integer addition, for example, can be performed as a single machine instruction, and some offer specific instructions to process sequences of characters with a single instruction. But the choice of primitive data type may affect performance, for example it is faster using SIMD operations and data types to operate on an array of floats.

===Integer numbers===

An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers. Integers may be either signed (allowing negative values) or unsigned (non-negative integers only). Common ranges are:

===Floating-point numbers===

A floating-point number represents a limited-precision rational number that may have a fractional part. These numbers are stored internally in a format equivalent to scientific notation, typically in binary but sometimes in decimal. Because floating-point numbers have limited precision, only a subset of real or rational numbers are exactly representable; other numbers can be represented only approximately. Many languages have both a single precision (often called &quot;float&quot;) and a double precision type (often called &quot;double&quot;).

===Booleans===

A Boolean type, typically denoted &quot;bool&quot; or &quot;boolean&quot;, is typically a &quot;logical type&quot; that can have either the value &quot;true&quot; or the value &quot;false&quot;. Although only one bit is necessary to accommodate the value set &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;, programming languages typically implement Boolean types as one or more bytes.

Many languages (e.g. Java, Pascal and Ada) implement Booleans adhering to the concept of Boolean as a distinct logical type. Some languages, though, may implicitly convert Booleans to &quot;numeric types&quot; at times to give extended semantics to Booleans and Boolean expressions or to achieve backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the language. For example, early versions of the C programming language that followed ANSI C and its former standards did not have a dedicated Boolean type. Instead, numeric values of zero are interpreted as &quot;false&quot;, and any other value is interpreted as &quot;true&quot;. The newer C99 added a distinct Boolean type codice_1 (the more intuitive name codice_2 as well as the macros codice_3 and codice_4 can be included with stdbool.h), and C++ supports codice_2 as a built-in type and &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; as reserved words.

==Specific languages==

===Java===
The Java virtual machine&#x27;s set of primitive data types consists of:
* codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 (integer types with a variety of ranges)
* codice_11 and codice_12, floating-point numbers with single and double precisions
* codice_13, a Boolean type with logical values codice_3 and codice_4
* codice_16, a value referring to an executable memory address. This is not accessible from the Java programming language and is usually left out.

=== C basic types ===

The set of basic C data types is similar to Java&#x27;s. Minimally, there are four types, codice_10, codice_8, codice_11, and codice_12, but the qualifiers codice_7, codice_9, codice_23, and codice_24 mean that C contains numerous target-dependent integer and floating-point primitive types. C99 extended this set by adding the Boolean type codice_1 and allowing the modifier codice_9 to be used twice in combination with codice_8 (e.g. codice_28).

=== XML Schema ===

The XML Schema Definition language provides a set of 19 primitive data types:
* codice_29: a string, a sequence of Unicode code points
* codice_13: a Boolean
* codice_31: a number represented with decimal notation
* codice_11 and codice_12: floating-point numbers
* codice_34, codice_35, codice_36, codice_37, codice_38, codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, and codice_42: Calendar dates and times
* codice_43 and codice_44: binary data encoded as hexadecimal or Base64
* codice_45: a URI
* codice_46: a qualified name
* codice_47: a QName declared as a notation in the schema. Notations are used to embed non-XML data types. This type cannot be used directly - only derived types that enumerate a limited set of QNames may be used.

=== JavaScript ===

In JavaScript, there are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, undefined, and null. Their values are considered immutable. These are not objects and have no methods or properties; however, all primitives except undefined and null have object wrappers.

=== Visual Basic .NET ===

In Visual Basic .NET, the primitive data types consist of 4 integral types, 2 floating-point types, a 16-byte decimal type, a Boolean type, a date/time type, a Unicode character type, and a Unicode string type.

=== Rust ===
Rust has primitive unsigned and signed fixed width integers in the format codice_48 or codice_49 respectively followed by any bit width that is a power of two between codice_50 and codice_51 giving the types codice_52, codice_53, codice_54, codice_55, codice_56, codice_57, codice_58, codice_59, codice_60 and codice_61. Also available are the types codice_62 and codice_63 which are unsigned and signed integers that are the same bit width as a reference with the codice_62 type being used for indices into arrays and indexable collection types.

Rust also has:

* codice_2 for the Boolean type.
* codice_66 and codice_67 for 32 and 64-bit floating point numbers.
* codice_10 for a unicode character. Under the hood these are unsigned 32-bit integers with values that correspond to the codice_10&#x27;s codepoint but only values that correspond to a valid unicode scalar value are valid.

== Built-in types ==

Built-in types are distinguished from others by having specific support in the compiler or runtime, to the extent that it would not be possible to simply define them in a header file or standard library module. Besides integers, floating-point numbers, and Booleans, other built-in types include:
* The void type and null pointer type codice_70 in C++11 and C23
* Characters and strings (see below)
* Tuple in Standard ML, Python, Scala, Swift, Elixir
* List in Common Lisp, Python, Scheme, Haskell
* Fixed-point number with a variety of precisions and a programmer-selected scale.
* Complex number in C99, Fortran, Common Lisp, Python, D, Go. This is two floating-point numbers, a real part and an imaginary part.
* Enumerated type sequence of names for allowed values; can improve readability and type checking.
* Rational number in Common Lisp
* Arbitrary-precision codice_71 type in Common Lisp, Erlang, Haskell
* Associative arrays, records or sets in Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Lua, D, Go
* Reference (also called a &quot;pointer&quot; or &quot;handle&quot; or &quot;descriptor&quot;),
* Symbols, in Lisp
* First-class function, in all functional languages, JavaScript, Lua, D, Go, and in newer standards of C++, Java, C#, Perl

===Characters and strings===
A character type is a type that can represent all Unicode characters, hence must be at least 21 bits wide. Some languages such as Julia include a true 32-bit Unicode character type as primitive. Other languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and many dialects of BASIC do not have a primitive character type but instead add strings as a primitive data type, typically using the UTF-8 encoding. Strings with a length of one are normally used to represent single characters.

Some languages have &quot;character&quot; types that are too small to represent all Unicode characters. These are more properly categorized as integer types that have been given a misleading name. For example C includes a codice_10 type, but it is defined to be the smallest addressable unit of memory, which several standards (such as POSIX) require to be 8 bits. Recent versions of these standards refer to codice_10 as a numeric type. codice_10 is also used for a 16-bit integer type in Java, but again this is not a Unicode character type. 

The term &quot;string&quot; also does not always refer to a sequence of Unicode characters, instead referring to a sequence of bytes. For example, x86-64 has &quot;string&quot; instructions to move, set, search, or compare a sequence of items, where an item could be 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes long.

<text>First Kid is a 1996 American slapstick comedy film directed by David Mickey Evans and starring Sinbad and Brock Pierce. It was mostly filmed in Richmond, Virginia.

==Plot==
Sam Simms is a Secret Service agent assigned by his superior Wilkes to protect President Paul Davenport&#x27;s rebellious 13-year-old son Luke Davenport after Luke&#x27;s behavior causes another agent Woods to be replaced for mistreating Luke in front of media cameras. Simms sees this assignment as undesirable, but a possible stepping stone to protecting the President. He fails to connect with the boy at first, and Luke continues to misbehave.

After seeing Luke get beat up by the school bully Rob, his parents punish him for the fight, even though he didn&#x27;t start it. Because of the re-election, they can&#x27;t risk Luke going out of public for a month while his parents are on the campaign trail. Simms feels sorry for him - he had felt alone as a teenager, too (losing his father in Vietnam while his mother worked 2-3 jobs to financially support him) - and they become friends. Simms, a former boxer, agrees to sneak Luke out against the wishes of his parents and teach him how to fight.

Meanwhile, Luke agonizes over asking the cutest girl, Katie to the school dance, which he finally does successfully with Simms&#x27;s help. However, while Simms and Luke are practicing some moves for the dance, the Secret Service director Morton tells them that they can&#x27;t go to the dance due to an emergency lockdown because of a duffel bag left unattended on the sidewalk outside the main entrance being investigated by the bomb squad. Simms, breaking the rules, takes Luke to the dance. There, Rob tries to attack Luke again while Simms is distracted, but this time, Luke puts him down.

After that, Secret Service agents bust the school dance and retrieve Luke. Simms is fired and not allowed to speak with Luke, who is crushed that his friend has apparently &quot;abandoned&quot; him. Luke, under house arrest and with a homing device attached to him, receives advice from an online friend, Mongoose12, on how to escape the White House and meet him at a local mall. Luke agrees, but it is revealed that Mongoose12 was in fact former agent Woods, who abducts him. When Luke goes missing, Simms is given another chance to protect him. With the help of his friend and former colleague Harold (a paraplegic who owns a spy shop), he quickly tracks Luke to the mall.

In a standoff, Woods says he was originally planning on returning Luke to the President so he could be a hero and get his job back, but now he wants to kill him instead, blaming Luke for making him lose his job, and even his wife. Woods tries to shoot Simms, but he takes cover and once Woods is out of bullets, Simms brings him down with a right uppercut. As other agents arrive, Woods tries to shoot Luke with a back-up revolver, but Simms jumps in front of Luke, causing him to take the intended bullet in his arm. Woods is also shot, subdued, and arrested by other arriving Secret Service agents for abduction, assault, discharging a firearm in a public place unlawfully, and attempted murder.

Simms is offered Presidential duty which he declines in order to stay with Luke full time, and so he can also spend more time with Luke&#x27;s biology teacher, with whom he has formed a romantic relationship.

==Cast==
* Sinbad as Secret Service Agent Sam Simms
* Brock Pierce as U.S. First Son Luke Davenport
* James Naughton as U.S. President Paul Davenport
* Timothy Busfield as Secret Service Agent Woods

This film would turn out to be the final on-screen appearance of Sonny Bono before his death in 1998, who, at the time of the film&#x27;s release, was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. Bono plays himself as a Congressman coming to the White House, to visit the President. Simms bumps into him (literally) outside the Oval Office and fawns over him.

==Ratings==
When &quot;First Kid&quot; was rated for video release by the BBFC, one minute and thirty one seconds were cut, due to the hostage attack in the shopping mall. At the time, the BBFC felt that this, and the sudden onslaught of violence, were too intense for a &#x27;PG&#x27; certificate. In 2002, all cuts were waived for a &#x27;PG&#x27; rating.

==Reception ==

===Box office===
The movie debuted at #3, behind &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; and &quot;Tin Cup&quot;. It did just over $8.4 million in ticket sales on 1,878 screens.

=== Critical response ===
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 20%, based on reviews from 15 critics. On Metacritic it has a score of 48% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

==TV series==
In December 1996, following the film&#x27;s release discussions were held with Disney&#x27;s TV division about adapting the film&#x27;s premise as a TV series.

<doc id="333493" wikidata="Q1935843" url="?curid=333493" title="Milton, New South Wales">
<text>Milton is a village in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, within the City of Shoalhaven. It was founded in 1860, named after the property of post master George Knight and became an important regional centre during the 19th Century. Today, Milton remains one of the two main commercial centres of the Milton-Ulladulla district, with a population at the of 1,663. It is a popular stopping place for travellers on the Princes Highway which runs through the centre of town. In recent years, Milton has undergone a resurgence largely influenced by the local tourism industry and an influx of residents to the district seeking a seachange. Several new housing estates are being developed on the fringes of the village and new boutique stores, cafes and bed and breakfast type businesses have located in the town.

==History==
The coastal area of the Milton-Ulladulla district was observed by Captain James Cook in 1770 when sailing along the east coast of Australia, before landing at Botany Bay. Cook noted the nearby Pigeon House Mountain, a prominent landmark.

The Reverend Thomas Kendall was the first European settler to the area, issued a land grant in nearby Yatte Yattah in 1827. He named the estate &quot;Kendall Dale&quot; and commenced pastoral activities as well as cutting red cedar found in abundance near Little Forest and Yackungarrah Creek. Poet Henry Kendall, the grandson of Thomas Kendall was born at the property in Yatte Yattah in 1839. Further land grants in the 1830s led to a town site being surveyed in 1837 at Boat Harbour (present day Ulladulla). The district prospered through the 1840s on the back of the timber industry.

Former convict, Henry Claydon took possession of 100 acres of land near Milton in 1855, establishing an estate known as Claydon Park. A devout Methodist, Claydon donated land in 1856 to the Wesleyan Church and the following year, the first church in the district was built on the site. The Sarah Claydon retirement village in Milton in named for Henry&#x27;s wife, who worked as a Midwife in the area until her death in 1876. The village was formally established in 1860 as a private town on land owned by John Booth, soon after followed by the construction of several public buildings, including the Star Hotel (1860), St Peter and St Paul Anglican Church (1860), Uniting and Catholic churches (1872), Town Hall (1871), courthouse and public school (1877) and a post office (1880). As a town, Milton is classified with the Australian National Trust, due to the number of homes and buildings in the town that were built from 1870 onwards. The town has declined in importance as a regional centre through the 20th Century, but remains a popular tourist destination.

==Facilities and infrastructure==

===Health and Education===

Milton has a public primary school; Milton Public School. Originally constructed in 1877, the school took its first enrollments in April 1878. From 1943 until 1973, it operated as a central school, catering for students of both primary and secondary age groups. The school has operated as a Kindergarten to Year 6 primary school since the beginning of 1974, and the original classroom is still in use alongside modern additions. Milton also has one private school. St Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea is a Catholic primary school located adjacent to the 1872 church. The Shoalhaven City Council operates a public library in the old town hall on the Princes Highway.

The Milton Ulladulla Hospital (MUH) located in the town provides accident and emergency, general ward, obstetric, oncology and outpatient facilities. The hospital services southern Shoalhaven area from Sussex Inlet south to North Durras as part of the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service. A helipad on Croobyar Road is used by the hospital for emergency evacuations.

Milton has a public swimming pool complex maintained by Shoalhaven City Council. The complex includes a 25m main pool, a shaded wading pool for toddlers and kiosk, along with picnic tables. The pools overlook the rural countryside, with views to the ocean. The Frogs Hollow sports ground located on Matron Porter Drive is home to the Milton Ulladulla Touch Football Association. Mick Ryan Park is a small botanical reserve containing a large heritage listed Illawarra little leaf fig tree believed to be over 180 years old. The tree covers a land area of close to one acre.

Milton Theatre was originally built in 1927 as the Milton School of Arts and later used as a picture theatre before closing in 1993. The building was subsequently restored and now operates as a 200-seat venue hosting community performances, as well as visiting national and overseas artists. A grand reopening gala concert in July 1998 relaunched the theatre following a $460,000 renovation. The theatre also contains a recording studio and is managed by a community committee in cooperation with the Shoalhaven City Council. Notable artists who have performed at the theatre include Justin Townes Earle, Muddy Waters, Eric Bogle, Sarah Blasko and former Hunters &amp; Collectors front man Mark Seymour who described it as the best live venue on the South Coast.

<text>The music of Bolivia has a long history. Out of all the Andean countries, Bolivia remains perhaps the most culturally linked to the indigenous peoples.

== History ==
Like most of its neighbors, Bolivia was long dominated by Spain and its attendant culture. Even after independence, Bolivian music was largely based on European forms. In 1952, a revolution established nationalistic reforms which included cultural and political awareness of the Aymara and Quechua natives. Intellectuals in the country began wearing ponchos and otherwise associating themselves with native cultures, and the new government promoted native folklore by, among other methods, establishing a folklore department in the Bolivian Ministry of Education.

Awareness of native music, spirituality and art continued into the 1960s. In 1965, Edgar &#x27;Yayo&#x27; Jofré formed a quartet called Los Jairas in La Paz. With Bolivian folk music gaining popularity throughout the country, Jofré, along with Alfredo Dominguez, Ernesto Cavour Julio Godoy, and Gilbert Favre used traditional music in modified forms to appeal to urban-dwellers and Europeans. Later groups like Wara, Khanata, Paja Brava, Savia Andina, and especially Los Kjarkas and Kalamarka helped further refine this fusion. Following a close but different path, groups and singers like Luzmila Carpio, Ruphay, and Grupo Aymara started touring abroad and gained international praise for their compositions, tunes that have brought indigenous Bolivian culture and history to the world&#x27;s attention.

Los K&#x27;jarkas consists of 3 brothers, the Hermosas, who play primarily Huayño or, more rarely, sayas. These are both dance music influenced both by native forms as well as African music imported to Bolivia with slavery. Los K&#x27;jarkas are known internationally for their Caporales classic &quot;Llorando se fue&quot;, which was adopted and transformed to the popular beginning of the lambada dance craze of the 1980s, along with forró and carimbo in northern Brazil. The song was popularized by a French group, resulting in a successful lawsuit from the Hermosa brothers.
Kalamarka was founded in 1984 by Hugo Gutierrez and Rodolfo Choque. They fusion folk instruments such as Zampoña, Quena, Charango and Bombo with modern instruments, creating a beautiful Andean music. Their famous songs are &#x27;Cuando Florezca el Chuño&#x27; and &#x27;Ama, Ama, Amazonas&#x27;.
In the 1980s, Chilean nueva canción was imported to Bolivia and changed into canto nuevo, which was popularized by performers like Emma Junaro.

Traditional Bolivian (and other South American) musical instruments include the charango, charangón, ronroco, hualaycho, zampoña, quena, bombo, huancara, reco reco, chiapya box, pinquillo, tarka, toyos, pututu, Andean saxophone, and Chajchas, as well as European musical instruments such as the violin and guitar.

Most prominent Bolivian musical forms identified in its culture and origins are the Kullawada, Morenada, Caporales, Llamerada, Diablada, Tonada (or, directly Tinku), Sikuri, Tarqueada, Taquirari, Carnavalito, Bailecito, Huayño, Lamento, Afro-Bolivian Saya, Tuntuna, Taki Taki, Waca Tocoris, Chovena, Sarao, Potolos, Pujllay, Danza Salay, Rueda Chapaca, Chacarera, Escondido, Tonada, Ch&#x27;unchu (dance), Tobas and Cueca which presents different variants in each Bolivian department.

<doc id="333495" wikidata="Q1210939" url="?curid=333495" title="The Monkey's Paw">
<text>&quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; is a horror short story by English author W. W. Jacobs. It first appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; in September, 1902, and was reprinted in his third collection of short stories, &quot;The Lady of the Barge&quot;, later that year. In the story, three wishes are granted to the owner of The Monkey&#x27;s Paw, but the wishes come with an enormous price for interfering with fate.

It has been adapted many times in other media, including plays, films, TV series, operas, stories and comics, as early as 1903. It was first adapted to film in 1915 as a British silent film directed by Sidney Northcote. The film (now lost) starred John Lawson, who also played the main character in Louis N. Parker&#x27;s 1907 stage play.

==Plot==
Mr. and Mrs. White, and their grown son, Herbert, are visited by Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British Army in India. During dinner, he introduces them to a mummified monkey&#x27;s paw. He explains how an old &quot;fakir&quot; has placed a spell on the paw, so that it will grant three wishes but only with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate. Morris, having had a horrible experience using the paw, throws it into the fire, but the sceptical Mr. White retrieves it. Before leaving, Morris warns Mr. White of what might happen should he use the paw.

Mr. White hesitates at first, believing that he already has everything he wants. At Herbert&#x27;s suggestion, Mr. White flippantly wishes for £200, which will enable him to make the final mortgage payment for his house. When he makes his wish, Mr. White suddenly drops the paw in surprise, claiming that it moved and twisted like a snake. The following day, Herbert leaves for work. That night, an employee arrives at the Whites&#x27; home, telling them that Herbert was killed in a terrible machine accident that mutilated his body. The company denies any responsibility for the incident, but declares its intention to make a goodwill payment to the bereaved family. When the despairing couple asks what the sum will be, they are told &quot;£200&quot;. 

A week after the funeral, Mrs. White, mad with grief, insists that her husband use the paw to wish Herbert back to life. Reluctantly, he does so, despite great unease at the thought of summoning his son&#x27;s mutilated and decomposing body. Later that night, there is a knock at the door. As Mrs. White fumbles at the locks in a desperate attempt to open the door, Mr. White becomes terrified and fears that the thing outside is not the son he loved. He makes his third and final wish. The knocking stops, and Mrs. White opens the door to find that no one is there.

<doc id="333496" wikidata="Q3889385" url="?curid=333496" title="Music of Chile">
<text>Chilean music refers to all kinds of music developed in Chile, or by Chileans in other countries, from the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors to the modern day. It also includes the native pre-Columbian music from what is today Chilean territory.

==Music in Chile==

===Pre-Columbian and colonial times===
Prior to the arrival of the European conquerors, the modern national borders that make up the Americas did not exist, so one cannot refer to music from &quot;Chile&quot;, or any other South American country, from this time. However, music existed in the Americas for centuries before European conquest, and many of the characteristics and instruments of pre-Hispanic music have formed part of the folkloric and musical tradition of Chile and of Latin America.
Archaeological excavations have unearthed many musical instruments showing the existence of a variety of musical cultures in the area long before even the Inca period. Scientific research into remains left by the Nazca and Mochica peoples has shown the existence of complex theoretical musical systems, with the presence of minor intervals, semitones, chromaticism and musical scales of five, six, seven and eight notes, equivalent to contemporaneous cultures in Asia and Europe.
Sociologist Carlos Keller has compared the Inca occupation of the Andean region with the Roman occupation of Greece or the Aztec conquest of the Maya. Like the Aztecs and Romans, the Incas took the knowledge and traditions of the cultures they found and incorporated them into their own. Inca music was formed by elements of Nazca, Chimú, Colla – Aymara and other cultures. It is also believed that the Incas were the first American people to develop some kind of formal music education.
;Atacama people

When the Incas advanced over the north of Chile, they encountered different native peoples and absorbed elements of their culture, especially the Atacameños (Atacama people). The Atacameños - themselves highly influenced by the Nazca - were an organized society that inhabited parts of the Atacama Desert, mainly in the east and central sectors of the region, and spread as far as Central Chile. They were conquered by the Incas in the 15th century, but today still speak and sing some of the ancient songs in cunza, the original language of their people.

;Mapuche people
The Mapuche people were the main indigenous people populating the region running from Copiapó in the north to Chiloé in the south. The Mapuche were never conquered by the Incas, so their music and musical instruments differ from the northern cultures that fell under Andean influence. Spanish chroniclers observed their musical rituals with interest, and their observations have allowed historians to compare this early music with the Mapuche music of the modern day. Historian Samuel Marti writes that the Mapuche “do not dance or sing to demonstrate knowledge and skill, or to entertain spectators, but to honour their gods”. Mapuche music today, despite the influence of Christianity, is still an expression of faith, hopes or fears to the traditional gods, because the conquest did not change the spirit of these peoples, even though it introduced new cultural elements.
The Franciscan missionary Geronimo de Ore (Lima, Peru, circa 1598) noted that Mapuche children learned songs from a very young age and demonstrated excellent memory and sense of rhythm. De Ore, realizing that these skills could be used as an evangelization and religious indoctrination tool, proposed that Christian prayers should have been taught in the native language and sung to native or European tunes. The same method was used in Chile by Jesuit priests. Jesuit priest Bernardo Havestadt came to Chile in 1748 and worked as missionary in La Mocha Concepción, Rere and Santa Fe. In 1777, he published a document in Westphalia that contains 19 Mapuche songs accompanied by European-style music. 
Unlike the Andean peoples, the Mapuches did not develop a theoretical musical system, but in practice one is imposed by the limitations of their instruments. The technique of playing these instruments has been preserved from generation to generation and melodies are formed by linking periods. There are no long notes in Mapuche music and the scales and melodic schemes of their music have no relation to the panphonic Andean music. In the seventeenth century, chronicler Gonzalez de Najera described the music as “more sad than happy” and the instruments as basic drums and flutes made of the shin bones of Spaniards and other native enemies. Other chroniclers agreed with Gonzalez de Naveja&#x27;s observations, including the jesuit Juan Ignacio Molina (Abate Molina).

;Mapuche musical instruments

wind instruments include:
Trutruca, or trutruka: a kind of trumpet, straight or spiral-shaped, made of colihue wood (Chusquea culeou) with a terminal or lateral mouthpiece and a cattle horn to amplify the sound.
: similar to the trutruca but smaller, made of ñolkin cane, a native plant species. 
Pingkullwe: a transverse flute with 5 holes, made of colihue wood (Chusquea culeou). 
Pifüllka or : a vertical flute with a closed end, made of wood and played in pairs.
Kull kull: a small trumpet made of bull horn.

Of the string instruments, the best known is the Kunkulkawe, known in other cultures as the Pawpaweñ, Latajkiaswole, or Alenta-Ji-Wole. It consists of a bow that is rubbed against another bow, with some chroniclers also describing a mouth bow.

Membranophone instruments include the Makawa, or kakel kultrung, a double-headed drum; and the Kultrun or Cultrun, a ceremonial drum and the most important musical instrument in Mapuche culture, used by the machi (healer or sorcerer) for religious and cultural rituals.

Idiophone instruments include the Kadkawilla or, a leather strap with jingle bells attached, which is played alongside the Cultrun; and the Wada or Huada, a rattle made of a pumpkin filled with small pebbles or seeds.
;Fueguinos
Music in the southernmost regions of modern Chile was produced by the Fueguino peoples, native inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, including the Onas, the Yaganes, the Yamanas and the Alacalufes). The Fueginos caught the attention of explorers in the early of the twentieth century, with North American Colonel Charles Wellington Furlong the first to record phonograph records of Ona and Yagan songs between 1907 and 1908. German priest and ethnologist Martin Gusinde studied and recorded their music, and in a letter from July 23, 1923, wrote of ceremonies with music and dancing very similar to those observed in the Amazon, which he described as sad, solemn and very limited in tonal range.

== Development of music in Chile ==
Chilean music is closely related with Chile&#x27;s history and geography. The landscape, climate and lifestyle vary greatly from north to south and have a deep impact on cultural traditions.
Popular music in the colonial period and during the struggle for independence was highly influenced by military bands and by the church. There were few musical instruments and very little opportunity to learn to play an instrument outside of military bands or churches if you were not from a wealthy family.
;Nineteenth century
In the nineteenth century, with the end of the colonial period and the transition to an independent republic, music and other aspects of culture gradually began to acquire a national identity.

During the first years of the republic, most of the leading musicians came from abroad. In 1823, a wave of professional musicians came to Chile, including: Bartolome Filomeno and Jose Bernardo Alzedo from Lima, Peru; Juan Crisóstomo Lafinur from Córdoba, Argentina; and the Spaniard, one of the most important figures of Chilean music of this period. Having studied the harp, guitar, piano and singing with Federico Massimino in Europe, Isidora&#x27;s superior musical knowledge was welcomed in the Chilean Tertulias (social gatherings of the wealthy, like a salon). She formally contributed to the development of Chilean music when she helped found both the first National Conservatory of Music and the Academy of Music in 1852. Some of the first opera and ballet performances in Chile also took place around this time.
By the end of the nineteenth century, musical clubs and other private organisations had sprung up in Santiago, Concepción, Valparaíso, Valdivia and other cities, including: “Club Musical de Santiago” (Santiago, 1871), “Sociedad Musical Reformada“ (Valparaíso, 1881), “Deutscher Verein” (1853) and “Club de la Union” (Valdivia, 1879), “Sociedad de Musical Clasica” (Santiago, 1879), and “Sociedad Cuarteto” (Santiago, 1885).
Some of the leading Chilean composers of the twentieth century were born at the end of the nineteenth century, including: Celerino Pereira Lecaros (1874), Prospero Bisquertt (1881), Carlos Lavin (1883), Javier Rengifo (1884), Alfonso Leng (1884), Enrique Soro Barriga (1884), Pedro Humberto Allende (1885), Carlos Isamit (1887), Acario Cotapos (1889), Armando Carvajal (1893), Samuel Negrete (1893), Roberto Puelma (1893), Juan Casanova Vicuña (1894) and Domingo Santa Cruz (1899).
;Twentieth century
By the twentieth century Chile had established its own musical scene, but, as in most of the American countries, the national identity had struggled to assert itself in a world where European styles were still dominant. Composer says of the influence of European styles: “The young American music is hill from aesthetic elements that hasn’t been digested”. This had led to an almost complete disregard for native folklore and tradition. 
From 1900 onwards, music began to take a more central place in Chilean society. The first Chilean recording label, Fonografía Artística (which produced both cylinders and discs), began its functions in Santiago around 1908. In 1912 the “Orchestral Society of Chile” was created and, over the next year, performed the nine symphonies of Beethoven, published the journal “La Orquesta” (The Orchestra), and debuted performances of Bach. Influential families began to cultivate music and take part in the creation of music appreciation societies. Once these influential families got involved in the music scene, musicians’ reputation in society started to change - previously seen as undesirable, they become to be viewed as an important part of culture, and having musical knowledge became essential for the cultured person.
Around 1928, the Bach Society, a civil organization of musicians and intellectuals, began to harshly criticise formal music education in Chile, especially at the “Conservatorio nacional” (National Conservatory). The society claimed that the number of students admitted to the conservatory was excessive and that the conservatory lacked long term planning, and criticised the cult of Italian opera as “retrograde”. The Ministry of Education set up a commission to look at reforming the organization, which eventually led to a new stage in the development of music in Chile, with the creation of organizations dedicated to creating music, teaching music and supporting musicians and composers.
Another institution that contributed to the development of music in Chile was the Universidad de Chile (University of Chile), when it created its High Arts Faculty in 1929. But even in 1802, long before the creation of the High Arts Faculty, there had been efforts within the institution to take the music culture and teaching to a highest level. In 1802, a group of professors from San Felipe University (which would later become the University of Chile) agreed that any teaching of music in their institution should be based not on the skills of musicians or the quality of a singer&#x27;s voice, but instead on scientific and mathematical principles.
The creation of the High Arts Faculty had an immediate effect. Soon after, a library was founded, a collection of albums produced, and several contests and activities held to promote Chilean musicians and composers.
The second half of the twentieth century saw many events and new institutions that contributed to the development of music in Chile, such as:
The creation of the “Instituto de extencion musical”, in 1940, which went on to found the (Chilean Symphonic Orchestra) in 1941, and the &quot;Revista Musical Chilena&quot; (Chilean Music Journal) in 1945.
The creation of the &quot;Instituto de investigacion folklorica&quot; (the Institute of Folkloric Research) in 1943, which would become the “Instituto de investigacion musical” (Institute of Music Research). The institute would become very active in promoting Chilean music, sponsoring and funding many Chilean musicians and composers.
In 1948, the High Arts Faculty split into a music and an art faculty, allowing both institutions to grow.
The creation of the &quot;Orquesta filarmonica de Chile&quot; (Chilean Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1955, which later changed its name to &quot;Orquesta filarmonica municipal&quot; (Municipal Philharmonic Orchestra). 
Also in 1955, the “Taller experimental del sonido” (Experimental Sound Laboratory) was set up in the “Universidad Catolica de Santiago” (Catholic University of Santiago). Following a visit to Chile by physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1958, experimentation with electronic music got scientific support and work began on an electronic music laboratory.
The &quot;Departamento de música&quot; (Music Department) at the &quot;Universidad Catolica de Santiago&quot; (Catholic University of Santiago) was created in 1959. The university already had an Institute of Music and a chamber orchestra, and also recorded and released music albums. In the same year, Jose Visencio Asuar published a thesis entitled &quot;Generación mecánica y electrónica del sonido musical&quot; (Mechanical and Electronic Generation of Musical Sound), and to demonstrate his thesis he composed &quot;Variaciones espectrales&quot; (Spectral Variations), the first piece of electronic music in Chile.
In the 1960s, the trend continued and several institutions dedicated to promoting music were set up throughout the country, including the &quot;Asociación de Coros de Tarapaca&quot; (Tarapaca Choirs Association) in the Tarapacá Region and the &quot;Orquesta de la Universidad Austral de Valdivia&quot; (Austral University of Valdivia Orchestra). This university and its music conservatory have made a great contribution to music in the south of Chile

1961 saw the launch of the “Folkloric Weeks”, an event organized by the Institute of Music Research. The same year, the “Orquesta Clásica Pro Música de Viña del Mar” (Viña del Mar Classical Music Orchestra) was born in Viña del Mar, and in Antofagasta the “Orquesta Sinfónica de la Universidad de Chile” (Symphony Orchestra of the University of Chile) was founded.
In 1962, the Organization of American States and the Faculty of Science and Musical Arts created the “Instituto Interamericano de Educación Musical” (Interamerican Institute of Musical Education).
Between 1962 and 1968, Jose Visencio Asuar released several albums of electronic music in Germany (Karlsruhe) and Venezuela (Caracas), and Tomás Lefever composed 19 tracks in this genre.
The University of Concepción created its “Escuela superior de música” (Music College) in 1963, and in Lota, coal miners created the “Coro Polifonico de Lota” (Lota Polyphonic Choir).
In La Serena in 1965, the Basic Music School was created, based on the experiences of the Children&#x27;s Orchestra from the same city.
The same year in Osorno, a Philharmonic Orchestra was created, along with a music college in the city&#x27;s university.
In 1966, the institute of music research released the first anthology album of Chilean folkloric music. In the same year, at the Universidad Catolica, Samuel Claro released his second electronic music album, “Estudio N°1”.
In 1967, the first electronic albums were released, with Asuar&#x27;s “Tres ambientes sonorous” (1967) and Amenábar&#x27;s “Klesis” (1968).
From 1966-1968, the education reforms led by the government caused a big impact on music education in schools, with more, better trained teachers required and new methods of study used. Around this time, in the second half of the 60s and first half of the 70s, the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song) movement began to emerge with Violeta Parra&#x27;s efforts to preserve over 3,000 Chilean songs, recipes, traditions, and proverbs. Other members of this movement included Víctor Jara, Patricio Manns, Isabel Parra, Ángel Parra, Osvaldo “Gitano” Rodríguez, and the bands Quilapayún, Inti Illimani and Illapu.
In 1969, the Music Department of the University of Chile in Antofagasta was created, and in 1970, the Symphony Orchestra of Chile performed the first televised concert broadcast via satellite, which was seen across almost all of the continent. The “Opera Nacional” (National Opera) was also founded under the “Instituto de Extencion Musical” and continuously incorporated national themes into their works.
After the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, music, like almost all forms of culture, suffered a major setback, especially popular music, due to the political affiliation of some musicians.
In the 1980s, the generation that grew up under the military regime slowly began to recover some cultural ground from the supporters of the regime. Punk and rock were a means to express political discontent, and were used as a form of protest. During this time, some bands distribute their material via homemade cassettes, and by the end of the regime, bands like Los Prisioneros would gain international recognition.
In the 1990s, Chile reconnected with the world and trends from Europe and the USA became part of Chile&#x27;s popular culture. The national music industry that had almost disappeared during the military regime was reborn, and local branches of the big record labels attempted to promote local bands, with varying results.

== Chilean folk music ==

=== Northern Chilean folk music ===
Northern traditional music in the territories between the regions of Arica y Parinacota and Coquimbo has been highly influenced by Andean music and by the Quechua, Aymara, Atacama and other cultures who lived around the area occupied by the Inca Empire prior the European arrival.
Other elements that influenced northern folklore included Spanish colonial military bands and the Catholic Church, due to the fact that both institutions had music as part of their ceremonies, and were therefore some of the only people who had musical instruments and the means to teach music methodically.
Traditional music has a dominant role in religious celebrations, which, in this zone of the country as in many other parts of the Americas, blends pre-Columbian and Christian forms of celebrating holy days. One example of this mixture is the Diabladas (Devil Dance) ritual, a colourful mix of dances and instrumental music. The La Tirana Festival, which takes place every July 16 in the town of La Tirana, is a fine example of both diabladas and Christian devotion.

* Northern Chile music instruments
;Traditional musical instruments of northern Chile
Some traditional musical instruments in this area were brought by the Spanish, while others are inherited from the native peoples.
They include:
* Quena (Quechua): Also known as “Kena”, this is the traditional flute of the Andes. Traditionally made of totora, it has six finger holes and one thumb hole.
* Zampoña: The siku (, , also &quot;sicu,&quot; &quot;sicus,&quot; &quot;zampolla&quot; or Spanish zampoña), is a traditional Andean panpipe. This is the main instrument used in a musical genre known as sikuri. It is traditionally found all across the Andes but is more typically associated with music from the Kollasuyo, or Aymara speaking regions around Lake Titicaca.
* Ocarina: This is a common instrument around the world. In the Americas, it dates from the time of the Incas and is used for festivals, rituals and ceremonies in some areas of the Arica y Parinacota and Tarapacá regions. Ocarinas in this part of the world are made of clay with 8–9 holes, sometimes shaped like an animal.
* Charango: The charango is a small Andean stringed instrument of the lute family. It originated in Quichua and Aymara populations in post-Columbian times, after the Americas came across the European stringed instruments, and survives in what are today the Andean regions of Bolivia, Peru, north of Chile and the northwest of Argentina, where it is widespread as a popular music instrument. About 66 cm long, the charango was traditionally made with the shell of an &quot;armadillo&quot; (&quot;quirquincho&quot;, &quot;mulita&quot;) and can also be made of wood, which is the most common material found today and considered more resonant. The charango is primarily played in traditional Andean music, but is sometimes used by other Latin American musicians. It typically has 10 strings in five courses of 2 strings each, but other variations exist. A charango player is called a &quot;charanguista&quot;.
* Bombo nortino: Literally “Northern bass drum”, this is a regional variation of the Bass drum, traditionally made of wood and covered in leather. It is used in most of the religious and pagan ceremonies.

===Central Chilean folk music===
The &quot;Valle central&quot; (Central Valley) is the extension of land that runs from the Chacabuco mountain range, which separates the Aconcagua and Maipo Valleys in the north of the Valparaiso region, to the Bio Bio river. The folklore in central Chile, as in southern Chile, is closely linked to rural life and Spanish heritage. The most iconic figure is the Huaso, a countryman and skilled horseman, similar to the American cowboy, Mexican charro or the gaucho of Argentina.
In Central Chile, the cueca and tonada dances and songs are the most characteristic styles. In this area of the country the most popular instruments are the accordion (introduced by the German immigrants through the south), guitar, harp, tambourine and the tormento, a Chilean instrument of colonial times used in the salon parties or “tertulias”, similar to a xylophone.

Among the other dances and music that are part of central Chilean folklore are the &quot;Sajuriana&quot;, originally from Argentina, &quot;the Refalosa&quot; introduced from the north, and the &quot;Vals&quot;, inherited from Europe and very popular during the first half of the nineteenth century among the upper classes. Others that are less well-known today include the &quot;Corrido&quot;, &quot;La Porteña&quot;, &quot;El Gato&quot;, &quot;La Jota&quot;, &quot;El Pequén&quot;, &quot;El Cuando&quot;, &quot;El Aire&quot;, &quot;El Repicao&quot;, &quot;La Polka&quot;, &quot;La Masurca&quot;, the &quot;Guaracha campesina&quot; and the &quot;Esquinazo&quot;.
;Cueca
The &quot;cueca&quot; (short for &quot;zamacueca&quot;) has long been considered the &quot;most traditional music and dance of Chile&quot;. It first appeared in 1824, though its origins are not clear. Since September 18, 1979, cueca has been affirmed as the official national dance.

Cueca is written in a combination of 6/8 and 3/4 at the same time and has a very rigid structure that is divided into three sections: the “cuarteta”, which contains four verses in eight syllables with rhymes in the second and fourth verses; the “seguidilla”; and the “remate”. The structure looks like this:
*Cuarteta...A-B-B-A-B-B...TOTAL: 24 measures
*Seguidilla...A-B-B-A-B-(B)...TOTAL: (20) 24 measures
*Remate... A ...TOTAL: 4 measures
According to Pedro Humberto Allende, a Chilean composer, &quot;neither the words nor the music obey any fixed rules; various motives are freely intermingled.&quot;
There are some variants of cueca in some areas of the country
In the northern regions, the cueca has no lyrics and is danced during religious feasts and carnival. The instruments used to perform it here include some of Andean origin, like sicus, zampoñas and brass (trumpets and tubas).
In the central regions, the cueca has lyrics and the instruments most commonly used to perform it are the guitar, tambourine, accordion and bombo.
On the island of Chiloe, the main difference in cueca consists of the absence of the initial “cuarteta”. The verses of the seguidilla are repeated and there is a greater emphasis placed on the interpretation of the lyrics by the singer rather than on the music or the dance.
Cueca brava (urban cueca) is a variation of the cueca that originated in the 1860s in the rougher neighbourhoods of cities, where it was sung and danced in places like bars and brothels.

;Tonada
The Tonada is another important form of Chilean traditional song, arising from the music brought by Spanish settlers. It is not danced and is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody in general. Several groups have taken the tonada as their main form of expression, such as Silvia Infantas y Los Baqueanos - Los Cóndores, Los Huasos Quincheros, Los Huasos de Algarrobal, Los de Ramon and others. The modern rural &quot;tonada&quot; is typically simple and &quot;monotonous&quot;, as described by Raquel Barros y Manuel Dannemann.

=== Southern Chilean folk music ===
The challenging landscape, the persisting population of Huilliche people, and the Spanish heritage which did not fade as much as elsewhere in the country, has given southern Chilean music some particular characteristics.
One of the places where this is most distinct is Chiloé. During the war of independence, Chiloé remained loyal to the Spanish Crown and royalist soldiers introduced to the islands dances like the “chocolate” and the “pericón”. The main feature of Chilote music is its vitality, a quality that is apparent in dances of agile and lively pace
A good part of the colonization of southernmost Chile carried out by Chilotes (the people of Chiloe), so their culture spread with them through southern Chile, including their music and dances.
On the other hand, the German migrants that came to the provinces of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue brought with them some of their customs and instruments, the most influential being the accordion, which quickly integrated into the existing music.
Typical music and dances include:
* “Pericona”
One of the most popular dances among Chilotes, this is danced by two loose couples, handkerchiefs in hands. It most likely came from Argentina where it is called &quot;Perico&quot;, and evolved in Chiloe, acquiring the name or “Pericona”.
* “El Costillar”
El Costillar, literally the &quot;rack&quot;, in reference to a rack of beef or pork, is a common dance in Chillan and in most isolated areas of southern Chile, most likely originating in Chiloé. It is a festive and competitive dance where the couples loosely dance around a bottle that has the function of a totem. The couple that knocks the bottle loses and has to leave the dance floor. As a “competition” dance, it can be danced by men only or by mixed couples.
* “La Trastrasera”
Native to Chiloé, but probably brought from Argentina by drovers who crossed the mountains with their cattle and goods, this dance was established in Chiloé and become part of the Chilean folklore. It is an easy dance to perform and can be adapted as rhythmic play for young children. The movements follow the instructions in the song lyrics.

* La trastrasera lyrics:
&lt;poem&gt;
Mariquita dame un beso
que tu mama lo mandó.
Tu mama manda en lo suyo
y en lo mío mando yo.
tu mama manda en lo suyo
y en lo mío mando yo.
Tras tras por la trastrasera
y también por la delantera,
tras tras por un costao
también por el otro lao.
Darán una media vuelta
y también una vuelta entera,
se tomarán de la mano
y harán una reverencia.
Tras tras por la trastrasera
y también por la delantera,
tras tras por un costao
también por el otro lao.&lt;/poem&gt;

* “El Chapecao”
“Chapecao” in Mapudungun means braiding, and refers to the nature of the dance that accompanies this song.
The song starts with a guitar playing solo and the couples taking part move around while the guitar plays. Suddenly the guitar stops and the dancers stop with it. This happens three times and then a cueca is played and danced, but the choreography allows the couples to exchange partners. After several exchanges the couples end with the same partner with which they started.
* “El Pavo”
This is a partner dance which simulates the courting rituals of the turkey, or “el pavo” in Spanish. The music of El Pavo is very similar to the cueca, though it lacks the concluding couplet, and its structure is based on an octosyllabic quatrain and rollovers.
* “Vals chilote”
The “Vals Chilote”, or Chilote Waltz, is deeply rooted in southern folklore and is also common in the central area of Chile. In the Chilote waltz, the man and woman dance in hold and the main difference with a normal Waltz is that the pace is more pronounced, resulting in very intense and energetic steps.
* Southern Chilean musical instruments
=== Rapa Nui (Easter Island) ===
Easter Island folk music has different origins from those of continental Chilean music. Instead, traditional music from the island consists of choral singing and chanting, similar to Tahitian music and the traditions of other Polynesian cultures. Families often performed as choirs, competing in an annual concert. They accompanied their chanting with a trumpet made from a conch and a percussive dancer jumping onto a stone which is set over a calabash resonator. Other instruments used include the kauaha, created from the jaw bone of a horse; the accordion; and stones, which are clapped together for percussive effect. The most characteristic dances are:
The &quot;Sau Sau&quot;, a dance of Samoan origin that was introduced in the 1940s. The dance emphasizes female grace and sensuality and in the choreography, the couple performs flexible movements of the hips and hands.
The &quot;Ula Ula&quot;, a dance of Tahitian origin that is usually performed during local festivities. The couples dance separated undulating their hips laterally.
The &quot;Tamuré&quot; also a Tahitian dance, is very fast and acrobatic and requires highly skilled dancers.
The Rainstick, Ukulele, Drum, and flute are instruments typically used in Rapa Nui music.

=== City folk music ===
* &quot;Música Tipica&quot;
From the 1920s onwards, Chilean folk music or &quot;Música Tipica&quot; (traditional music) experienced a rebirth. This rebirth brought rural music and folklore into the cities, on to the radios and caught the attention of a flourishing music industry, which took some of the more refined versions of Chilean &quot;Tonada&quot; and transformed them into a spectacle for the cities. One of the first groups that can be linked to this style are &quot;Los Huasos de Chincolco&quot;, who started a trend that inspired the public, although their music had little in common with real rural folk music. In the 1930s and after, groups like “Los Huasos Quincheros”, “Los Cuatro Hermanos”, “Ester Sore”, “Silvia Infantas y los Cóndores”, and “Francisco Flores del Campo” kept this style alive and became very popular. During the 1940s and 1950s, this refined version of folkloric music became a national emblem, mainly for its aesthetic and as a spectacle to celebrate patriotism. One of the characteristics of the folkloric trend is its use of patriotic themes and a romantic, idealized view of rural life. That idealized view would be questioned in the following decades by Víctor Jara, Violeta Parra and the other musicians that formed the “Nueva Cancion Chilena” movement.

==&quot;La Nueva Canción Chilena&quot;==
The Nueva Canción (New Song) is a movement that appeared in the mid 1960s and involved not just Chile but the rest of Latin America and Spain. The movement incorporated strong political and social themes and was used as a tool for expressing political and social conscience.
The Nueva Canción Chilena (New Chilean Song) broke with the prevailing folkloric styles of its time, which presented an idealized view of the rural world and ignored the situation of marginalized workers on the “Fundos” (large estates) and in isolated rural areas of the country.
In a period of political struggle across Latin America, the “Nueva Canción” became associated with political activism and reformers like the Chilean Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity government. It soon emerged in other countries like Argentina, where the movement was called “Nuevo Cancionero” and was led by Mercedes Sosa and Armando Tejada Gómez among others.
The foundations of the movement were laid through the efforts of Violeta Parra to revive over 3,000 Chilean songs, recipes, traditions, proverbs and folkloric characters, like the &quot;payadores&quot; (improviser-singers). Violeta Parra, and artists like her, acted as a vehicle for a folkloric tradition that otherwise would have remained unknown for many Chileans in the cities. Violeta Parra and her brothers paved the way for other key Chilean folkloric artists like Rolando Alarcón, Payo Grondona, Patricio Castillo, Homero Caro, Tito Fernández, Kiko Álvarez, Patricio Manns and Víctor Jara. Jara emerged as one of the major voices of the Nueva Canción and began its traditions of criticising government officials and policies. Since September 1973, the new military government of Augusto Pinochet threatened Nueva Canción artists, driving them underground during the 1970s. Cassette tapes of artists like Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún were circulated in a clandestine manner. The groups continued to oppose Pinochet&#x27;s government from exile, and helped inspire Nueva Canción singers from Uruguay (Daniel Viglietti), El Salvador (Yolocamba l&#x27;ta), Guatemala (Kin-Lalat), Mexico (Amparo Ochoa), Nicaragua (Carlos Goodys and Luís Enrique Mejía Godoy), as well as Cuban Nueva Trova artists like Pablo Milanés.

==Popular music==
=== Rock and roll ===

Rock and roll music was first produced in Chile in the late 1950s by bands that imitated and were inspired by international rock and roll hits from the U.S., often translating these songs for the Chilean market. This movement was known as the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; (New Wave). During the second half of the 1960s, after the success of rock and roll music, the &quot;Fusión latinoamericana&quot; (Latin American fusion) and &quot;Nueva Canción&quot; (New Song) genres were born in Chile, bringing together rock and roll and Latin American folk music. Los Jaivas are an example of this fusion between the two convergent styles.
In the 1970s, however, the country&#x27;s rock scene declined due to political repression
The 1980s saw the beginning of a revival of rock music in Chile which has continued until the modern day, with the growth of many rock subgenres and many Chilean bands finding success on the international market in recent years.
Some of the most successful Chilean rock bands are: Los Prisioneros, Lucybell, La Ley, Javiera Mena, Francisca Valenzuela, Los Jaivas, Los Tres, Chancho en Piedra, Panico, Sol y Lluvia, Nicole (Chilean singer), Los Miserables, Buddy Richard.

=== Hip hop and rap ===
Since the mid to late 1980s, hip hop music have had a considerable influence on the Chilean music scene and culture. People of Chile had their first contact with this genre through the television and radio. First to appear and gain popularity were Breakdance and breakers groups: “Montaña Breakers”, “B14”, “T.N.T.”, “Floor Masters”. Breakers from all over the capital would gather in Bombero Ossa Street in Central Santiago to share music and have breakdance “battles”. Then came the first Chilean rap groups, such as “Los Marginales” and “Panteras Negras”. The return of immigrants after the end of the dictatorship could also have been a factor that increased the popularity of hip hop and rap, with examples such as Jimmy Fernandez (ex La Pozze Latina) returning from Italy, or “Floor Masters” front man who came from Los Angeles. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the mid-1990s that hip hop gained mainstream popularity with successful groups such as Tiro de Gracia, Los Tetas, Makiza, Zaturno and La Pozze Latina. Commercial success was confirmed in 1997, when “Tiro de Gracia” and “Makiza” got Golden and Silver Discs and filled venues along the country.
During the 2000s, some bands connected hip hop with other styles like dancehall, reggae, and Latin rhythms. Also in the 2000s, political rap became popular, with groups like, “Panteras Negras”, “LB1”, “Subverso”, “Guerrillerokulto” and “Salvaje Decibel”. Como Asesinar a Felipes is the first Experimental hip hop band that has achieved a considerable success, being produced by Koolarrow Records. 
Most recently, Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux (formerly of Makiza) has become one of the most successful rap artists, collaborating with Mexican musician Julieta Venegas and having tracks featured on the EA Sports video game &quot;FIFA 11&quot;. Her music has appeared in the popular TV series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; (season 4, episode 5).

=== Chilean electronic music ===
The electronic music movement as we know it today reached Chile in the 1990s, but there are some earlier milestones worth mentioning, like the sound experiments of engineer and scientist Jose Visencio Asuar in 1959 after the 1958 visit of physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler, and the production of the first electronically generated music records in the 1960s.
“Electronica” has given Chile more international success than any other style of music; Chilean DJs and electronic music producers are among the most important in the international scene.
Many Chilean DJs are based in Europe, particularly in Germany. Some were children of political exiles while others moved to Europe to develop their careers and then stayed following their great success.
Some of the most important and best known electronic music artists are: Ricardo Villalobos, Andrés Bucci, Cristian Vogel, Latin Bitman, Danieto, Luciano, Pier Bucci, Nicolas Jaar and Jorge González.

=== Chilean cumbia ===
 

Cumbia style has its origins in the caribbean climates of Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, and was introduced to Chile in the mid 1960s by the Venezuelan Luisín Landáez. Later in the same decade, Colombian musician Amparito Jiménez would record and release albums in Chile and had great success with the song “La pollera colora”, one of the most emblematic Colombian songs. Later, the Chilean band Sonora Palacios would bring cumbia to mass popularity among the Chilean population. Since the beginning, Chile has developed its own kind of cumbia known as &quot;&quot;cumbia sonora&quot; or just &quot;traditional Chilean cumbia&quot;&quot;, with long standing orchestras such as Orquesta Huambaly, La Sonora de Tommy Rey, Sonora Palacios, Los Vikings 5, Giolito y su combo and Pachuco y la Cubanacán. These have been some of the most popular acts in the last 50 years and still enjoy mainstream popularity, seen as part of Chile&#x27;s musical culture and identity. Chilean cumbia added brass instruments, piano and a faster percussion to the original cumbia style. The process of adaptation and evolution created a sub style that can be easily identified from the original. Chilean cumbia bands are called “Combos”, “Sonoras” or simply “Orquestas” (orchestras) and are formed by 10 or more musicians where the brass and the drums have an important role. Cumbia developed this orchestral performance style in the 1960s, adapting from the tropical orchestras that had played rhythms such as the cha-cha-cha, mambo, rumba, bolero, and merengue in the 1920–1940s. Some subgenres that were not originally from Chile also became popular in the country: In the 1990s, cumbia sound, known in other countries of Latin America as Technocumbia, is a style of dumbia where there is a fusion between electronic sounds generated by electronic drums, and electric guitar. &quot;Technocumbia&quot; was a name given to the subgenre in Mexico to describe this type of music. However, the style was developed throughout South America with different names: “Sound” in Chile. emerged, a style where great emphasis was placed on the (usually romantic) lyrics and where the artists can be a solo male or female singer rather than a band. Unlike Technocumbia, cumbia romantica arrangements tend to be acoustic. Some performers in this subgenre are La Noche and Américo). Also in the 2000s, a style called New Chilean cumbia or “Cumbia Rock” emerged, led by bands like (Chico Trujillo, La Mano Ajena, and Juana Fe). This new Chilean cumbia is highly influenced by rock and some hip hop groups, although in some cases the influence of Andean music, Balkan music Klezmer, Salsa and Bolero can be heard. It main exponents are Chico Trujillo, Banda Conmoción, Juana Fe, La Mano Ajena, Cholomandinga, Villa Cariño, Combo Ginebra, etc.

===Mexican music in Chile===
Among the Chilean upper class, Mexican music has gained more acceptance since the 2000s. In part, this trend is explained by the popularity of the musical talent show &quot;Rojo Fama contra Fama&quot; on TVN, which aired for the first time in 2002. María José Quintanilla in particular gained acclaim on the program by singing ranchera songs.
== Chilean Jazz ==

The practice of &quot; jazz &quot; is one of the most popular manifestations of popular music in Chile. The most regular tracks appear towards the 1920s around the figure of the composer, violinist and researcher Pablo Garrido, manager of the first ensembles and local jazz orchestras. From 1940, a new generation of young musicians aligned themselves with jazz improvisation beyond the predecessor jazz, which they considered commercial, baptizing it hot jazz. This would result in the founding of the Club de Jazz de Santiago in 1943 and the formation of the first national all-stars, The Chilean Aces of Jazz, in 1944 and 1945.

Modern jazz broke into the 1960s at the initiative of the pianist Omar Nahuel, at the head of the Nahuel Jazz Quartet. The band was not only a pioneer in the development of new jazz forms, such as bebop or cool, but also brought together enthusiastic musicians of the figure of Charlie Parker and his descendants. In the 1970s, as in the rest of the world, the electric jazz installed a new expressive form and gave rise to new soloists in Chile.

Since the 1980s, jazz has had in Chile the possibility of training professional musicians thanks to the creation of &quot;ProJazz&quot;, the &quot;Escuela Moderna de Música&quot; and the School of Music of the SCD, which has allowed the development of the jazz language during the following decades. With the creation of the Festival Internacional Providencia Jazz in the year 2002, along with other communal festivals, jazz has achieved greater diffusion for the non-expert public in the 21st century.

Currently, the national scene stands out for the multiplicity of styles, among which stand out: the group La Marraqueta in the avant-garde of the so-called &quot;jazz criollo&quot;, a wide variety of groups in the Latin American fusion, and the big bands, such as the Conchalí Big Band or Los Andes Big Band, in the traditional jazz as bebop or the swing.

Among the figures of contemporary Chilean jazz stand out: Jorge Vera, Ricardo Arancibia, Mariano Casanova, Cristián Cuturrufo, Camila Meza, Federico Dannemann, Sebastián Jordán, Mario Feito, Christian Gálvez, Pedro Greene, Martin Joseph, Ronnie Knoller, the Lecaros Family; Mario Lecaros, Pablo Lecaros, Roberto Lecaros, Agustín Moya, Gonzalo Palma, Ángel Parra Orrego, Andrés Pérez, Lautaro Quevedo, Felipe Riveros, Carla Romero, Moncho Romero, Melissa Aldana, Miguel Sacaan and Nicolás Vera, José Gil, Antonio Lambertini, Jorge Caraccioli and the groups La Marraqueta, Contracuarteto, Los Titulares, Ángel Parra Trío, Holman Trío, Caravana Trío and Ensemble Quintessence, among many others.

==Academic music==
Since the beginning of the Chilean republic, the need for highly trained musicians in educational institutions and in the classical music scene was evident. Initially, this need was fulfilled by artists coming from nearby Peru (Viceroyalty of Peru), both former important viceroyalties of Spain. In 1823, a wave of professional musicians came to Chile, including: Bartolome Filomeno and Jose Bernardo Alzedo from Lima, Peru; and the Spaniard,
From 1900 onwards, music began to take a more central place in Chilean society. In 1912 the “Orchestral Society of Chile” was created and, over the next year, performed the nine symphonies of Beethoven, published the journal “La Orquesta” (The Orchestra), and debuted performances of Bach.
Once the influential families got involved in the music scene, musicians’ reputation in society started to change - previously seen as undesirable, or just entertainers, they started to be viewed as an important part of culture, and having musical knowledge became essential for the cultured person.
The most prolific period of classic music in Chile began in the 1950s, with the founding of several projects aiming to educate, promote and research music, along with the implementation of educational reforms and the foundation of Youth and Children&#x27;s Orchestras - like that created in the city of La Serena, led by conductor and composer Jorge Peña Hen. This process continued until 1973 when political repression hit culture and music across the board. The music industry, live performances, the media, and even musical education were affected, with musical education officially suppressed as a mandatory high school subject.
One of the most traditional classical music events in Chile is the “Semanas musicales de Frutillar” (Frutillar musical weeks) in the southern city of Frutillar in Los Lagos Region (Region of the Lakes). The festival take place between January and February every year, and consists of 40 or more classical concerts performed by both Chilean and international artists. The construction of a new venue, the Teatro del Lago (Lake Theatre) which opened in 2010, has given the festival a boost, providing space for more performances and larger audiences.
Since the 1990s, classical music has slowly recovered its place in Chilean culture and education, with projects like “FOJI” (the Foundation for Youth and Children&#x27;s Orchestras), a non-profit organization that works to form orchestras and educate young people in several cities around Chile. Their programme reaches more than 12,000 teens and children every year, and their orchestras perform concerts that reach an audience of almost a million.
Among the best known Chilean classical composers are
José Zapiola Cortés, Enrique Soro and Pedro Humberto Allende. Allende put special effort to include some elements of Chilean tradition and folklore in his work, with works such as the symphonic poem “La Voz de las Calles” (The Voice of the Streets); “Doce Tonadas para Piano” (Twelve Tunes for Piano); and the “Concierto Sinfónico para Violoncello y Orquesta” (Symphonic Concerto for Cello and Orchestra), whose rhythmic richness was praised by Claude Debussy. Other important Chilean composers include Vicente Bianchi known for his compositions based on Pablo Neruda poems; Alfonso Leng, one of the most influential Chilean classical composers with a mystic and romantic style influenced by Wagnerian Post-romanticism; Luis Advis Vitaglich, known by his work (“Cantata de Santa Maria de Iquique”); Carlos Riesco; Domingo Santa Cruz Wilson; Roberto Falabella Correa; Nina Frick Ajenjo; Carlos Isamitt; Juan Orrego-Salas; Alfonso Letelier; Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt; Sergio Ortega; Leon Schidlowsky; Leni Alexander; Fernando García; Juan Allende-Blin; Cirilo Vila; Santiago Vera-Rivera; Andrés Alcalde; René Amengual; Próspero Bisquertt; Gabriel Brncic; Salvador Candiani; Acario Cotapos; Alejandro Guarello; Hans Helfritz; María Elena Hurtado; Tomás Lefever; Eduardo Maturana; Claudio Spies; Jorge Urrutia Blondel and Darwin Vargas, among many others.
Among the most prominent conductors are Fernando Rosas Pfingsthorn, Armando Carvajal, Juan Pablo Izquierdo, Sebastián Errázuriz and Víctor Tevah.
One of the best-known performers is pianist Claudio Arrau, known for his vast repertoire spanning from baroque to 20th-century composers, especially Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt and Brahms. He is widely considered one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century.
Other great include Rosita Renard, Oscar Gacitúa Weston, Roberto Bravo, Elena Waiss, Elisa Alsina, Liza Chung, Alfredo Perl and currently Valentín Trujillo, who has interpreted a repertoire of classical as well as popular music, and is well known for taking part in television programmes.
Today, Chilean classical music has had a strong boost thanks to the efforts of the International Society for Chilean Music (SIMUC) and outstanding performers such as Luis Orlandini, Eulogio Dávalos Llanos, Nicolas Emilfork, Romilio Orellana, Carlos Pérez, Cristián Alvear Montecino and Juan Antonio Escobar. These have had a significant influence on the work of younger composers, such as: Juan Antonio Sánchez, Antonio Restucci and Horacio Salinas, who have moved beyond their classical education to incorporate folk and fusion music.

<text>Peruvian music is an amalgamation of sounds and styles drawing on Peru&#x27;s Andean, Spanish, and African roots. Andean influences can perhaps be best heard in wind instruments and the shape of the melodies, while the African influences can be heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European influences can be heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. Pre-Columbian Andean music was played on drums and string instruments, like the European pipe and tabor tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into hexatonic, and in some cases, diatonic scales.

==History==

Peruvian music reflects the country’s rich cultural heritage, blending Indigenous, Spanish, and African influences. Pre-Columbian traditions, characterized by instruments like pan flutes and drums, were later infused with Spanish stringed instruments such as the guitar and harp. During the colonial period, African rhythms introduced vibrant percussive styles. Iconic genres like &quot;huayno&quot; and &quot;marinera&quot; emerged, highlighting regional diversity. In the 20th century, Peruvian music evolved further with &quot;criollo&quot; music gaining prominence and the rise of Andean fusion bands like Los Kjarkas and international stars such as Susana Baca, promoting Peru’s musical identity globally.
The earliest printed polyphonic music in Peru, indeed anywhere in the Americas, was &quot;Hanacpachap cussicuinin,&quot; composed or collected by Juan Pérez Bocanegra and printed in 1631.

==Instruments==

===Stringed instruments===
Peruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during the Viceroyalty of Peru by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the Indigenismo movement (1910–1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon.

While the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played.

===Percussion instruments===
The cajón is an important percussion instrument developed by African slaves. People imply the cowbell may also be of African origin. While the rhythms played on them are often African-influenced, some percussive instruments are of non-African origin. For example, of European origin is the bombo, and of Andean origin are the wankara and tinya respectively.

===Wind instruments===
In addition to the ocarina and waqra phuku, there are Peruvian wind instruments of two basic types, panpipes and flutes, both of Native Andean origin and built to play tritonic, pentatonic and hexatonic scales, though some contemporary musicians play instruments designed to play European diatonic scales. Of the former variety, there are the siku (or &quot;zampoña&quot;) and antara. Of the latter variety, there are the pinkillu, tarka, and quena (qina) flutes.

<text>Eastern Silesia was formerly the Austrian crownland Austrian Silesia, which was occupied by Czechoslovakia after World War I. It had an area of 1,987 sq mi (5,146 km2), with a population of 680,422 in 1900. The capital was Opava. Plans for a plebiscite fell through, and the area was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland.

The territory was entered by the Czech military on 23 January 1919, after negotiations with Poland broke down.

A final agreement on the border was reached on 28 July 1920.

== Postage stamps ==

Eastern Silesia is remembered today by philatelists, since the plans for the plebiscite included the issuance of special postage stamps. These were stamps of Czechoslovakia and Poland, overprinted with various combinations of &quot;SO&quot; or &quot;S. O.&quot; (Fr. &quot;Silesie Orientale&quot;), and &quot;1920&quot;. They were in use from February to September 1920. The overprints were produced in considerable numbers; with a few exceptions, the stamps are commonly available today at the minimum price.

The postal history of the territory is quite complicated, with both overprinted and stamps of the contending countries (and Austria) in use at different post offices at different times.

<doc id="333504" wikidata="Q6772928" url="?curid=333504" title="Married Love">
<text>Married Love or Love in Marriage is a book by British academic Marie Stopes. It was one of the first books openly to discuss birth control.

The book begins by stating that &quot;More than ever to-day are happy homes needed. It is my hope that this book may serve the State by adding to their number. Its object is to increase the joys of marriage, and to show how much sorrow may be avoided.&quot;

The preface states that it was geared toward teaching married couples how to have a happy marriage, including &#x27;great sex&#x27; – and it was thus offering a service to &#x27;the State&#x27; by reducing the number of people affected by failed marriages.

The central question is how can the &quot;desire for freedom&quot; and &quot;physical and mental exploration&quot; be balanced with the limits of monogamy and raising a family. The answer is not &quot;in the freedom to wander at will&quot; but a &quot;full and perfected love&quot;. In Stopes&#x27; lexicography love means sex and &quot;access to the knowledge of how to cultivate it&quot;.

== Publishing history ==
Stopes had already published books based upon her work as a research scientist. However, the publishers – both academic and mainstream – she approached for &quot;Married Love&quot; felt the subject matter too controversial and turned it down. Its publication was finally financed by Humphrey Roe, a Manchester businessman and birth control campaigner, who Stopes would later marry. Roe paid the £200 required by the small publishing firm Fifield &amp; Co. who published &quot;Married Love&quot; in March 1918.

It rapidly sold out, and was in its sixth printing within a fortnight.

The US Customs Service banned the book as obscene until April 6, 1931, when Judge John M. Woolsey overturned that decision. Woolsey was the same judge who in 1933 would lift the ban on James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, allowing for its publication and circulation in the United States of America.

It was the first book to note that women&#x27;s sexual desire coincides with ovulation and the period right before menstruation. The book argued that marriage should be an equal relationship between partners. Although officially scorned in the UK, the book went through 19 editions and sales of almost 750,000 copies by 1931.

In 1935 a survey of American academics said &quot;Married Love&quot; was one of the 25 most influential books of the previous 50 years, ahead of &quot;&quot; by Albert Einstein, &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; by Sigmund Freud, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; by Adolf Hitler and &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; by John Maynard Keynes.

The book was the basis for a 1923 British silent film adaptation &quot;Married Love&quot; directed by Alexander Butler.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (Series 4, Episode 4): Housekeeper Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) says it is impossible for lady&#x27;s maid Edna Braithwaite (Myanna Burring) to be pregnant because Edna owns a copy of &quot;Married Love&quot;, suggesting that she understands methods of birth control, and therefore could not be pregnant by Tom Branson (Allen Leech).
*&quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (Series 5, Episodes 2, 3, and 6): In Episode 2 of the fifth series, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) has a copy of the book, which she uses to ensure her week-long dalliance with Lord Gillingham (Tom Cullen) has no &quot;unwanted epilogue&quot;. In Episode 3 she asks for her lady&#x27;s maid Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) to hide the book and the contraceptive device (most likely a cervical cap, which she had had Anna purchase according to the book&#x27;s recommendation) in her home to avoid it being discovered in the house. In Episode 6 Anna&#x27;s husband, John Bates (Brendan Coyle), discovers the device in their home, and is hurt by the prospect that his wife is trying to prevent them having children, which had been a topic of the series between them, but he is unaware that the book and device were being used by Lady Mary and not his wife. Only after a while did he realize that the device was Mary&#x27;s and not Anna&#x27;s.
* In &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; (Episode 5), a 2012 BBC miniseries, the character Valentine Wannop finds a copy of the book in the changing rooms at the school where she works as a games mistress. She discusses it with the rest of the school staff and decides to put it back, not confiscate it, to give the girls a chance to learn about sex before they are married.
* In &quot;The Giver of Stars&quot; by JoJo Moyes, &quot;Married Love&quot; is a &quot;dirty book&quot; being challenged at the packhorse library in the fictional town of Baileyville, Kentucky.

<doc id="333507" wikidata="Q649969" url="?curid=333507" title="Ulladulla, New South Wales">
<text>Ulladulla () is a coastal town in New South Wales, Australia in the City of Shoalhaven local government area. It is on the Princes Highway about south of Sydney, halfway between Batemans Bay to the south and Nowra to the north. Ulladulla has close links with the nearby historic settlement of Milton and many services are shared between these towns.

==History==
The name Ulladulla is the modern spelling of an Aboriginal word, the meaning of which is unknown. Some records show the name meaning &quot;safe harbour&quot;, but local Aboriginal elders dispute that meaning and point out that a harbour for boats is a modern idea. The name was corrupted to &quot;Holy Dollar&quot; at one time. Alternative spellings as Woolladoorh or Ngulla-dulla have been recorded. The first European settler was Reverend Thomas Kendall in 1828 who started cutting Australian red cedar at Yackungarrah and Narrawallee Creek in Yatte Yattah, four kilometres north of present day Milton.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, there were 17,026 people in Ulladulla.

* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.1% of the population.
* 80.9% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 4.3%, New Zealand 1.4%, Scotland 0.6%, Italy 0.5% and Germany 0.5%.
* 90.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 0.5%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.5%, Catholic 19.7% and Anglican 17.6%.

==Geography==
The Ulladulla area is a seven-kilometre stretch of continuous urban residential development from the southern edge of Ulladulla, through the town of Mollymook, to Narrawallee in the north, terminating at the Narrawallee estuary. At the 2021 census the population of the suburb of Ulladulla was 7,262.

Ulladulla is surrounded by the adjoining towns of Milton and Burrill Lake as well as Mollymook and Narrawallee. The extended area from Burrill Lake to Milton is referred to as the Milton–Ulladulla area. The population of the Ulladulla area, including Milton, Narawallee and south to Dolphin Point was 16,495 as at June 2019, having grown an average of 1.66 percent year-on-year over the preceding five years.

Close landmarks include Pigeon House Mountain and The Castle, both named due to the unique shapes of the mountain. Pigeon House was sighted by Captain James Cook upon his journey along the eastern shores of Australia. Pigeon House has recently been renamed Didhol in deference to the elders of the Yuin tribe, who previously inhabited the area Ulladulla was built upon. The traditional name of the peak, Didhol, means &quot;woman&#x27;s breast&quot;, from the mountain&#x27;s clear resemblance to the shape of a woman&#x27;s breast.

===Climate===
Ulladulla has a warm oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) moderated by its position next to the Tasman Sea, with warm, rainy summers and mild, somewhat drier winters. Average maxima vary from in January to in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and February and in July.
Precipitation is moderately abundant, averaging annually, and is spread across 95.5 precipitation days (above the threshold). Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 18 January 2013 to on 10 July 1995.

==Ulladulla Harbour==
Ulladulla Harbour is a minor port administered by the Land &amp; Property Management Authority.

The first white Settler was Rev Thomas Kendall in 1828 who started cedar cutting at Narrawallee Creek in Yatte Yattah.

A wooden jetty was built in 1859 so as to retain the services of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company; the company had informed the farmers that would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef. The company built a store on the harbour foreshores for the receiving of produce for shipment to and from Sydney. There was a weekly cargo service to Ulladulla until the mid-1950s. In 1873, a lighthouse was constructed on the harbour breakwater, and it was known at the time as the Ulladulla Lighthouse. It was relocated in 1889 to Warden Head, south of the harbour, where it is still active.

During the mid-1890s, a 4 ft (1220 mm) gauge tramway was laid out to the end of the main stone wharf. Manpower and horses were used to move the low wagons. During the period 1910–11, a double line of track was laid to the end of the pier. Public Works Department records disclose maintenance of track and repair of wagons at least to 1947–48. Almost all trace of the line had gone by 1991.

The harbour is the home port of the largest commercial fishing fleet on the South Coast of New South Wales.

===Blessing of the Fleet festival===
The Blessing of the Fleet festival has been held regularly at Easter since 1956. This is a centuries-old tradition which originated in Sicily, Italy, and has been continued by the area&#x27;s descendants of the original Italian immigrant fishing community.

A significant element of the festival is the religious Blessing of the Fleet ceremony held at Ulladulla Harbour on Easter Sunday. The festivities conclude with fireworks display, over the harbour on Easter Sunday and the Harbour Markets on Easter Monday.

Although the accompanying celebration was cancelled due to a sharp rise in the public liability premium in 2004 and 2005, the ceremony returned in 2008. It was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2022 it returned but under COVID restrictions.

==Public transport==
Premier Motor Service operate two daily service in each direction between Sydney and Eden as well as two services from Bomaderry railway station that connect with NSW TrainLink services.

Ulladulla Buslines provides local bus services on weekdays with a reduced service on Saturdays. Three routes operate from Ulladulla. Routes 740 and 740V run from Burrill Lake to Milton via Kings Point, Ulladulla, Mollymook and Narrawallee. Route 741 runs at a lesser frequency on weekdays only from Ulladulla to Kiola via Burrill Lake, Tabourie Lake, Termeil and Bawley Point. Taxis and private hire cars are also available for transport throughout the district.

== Commercial area ==
Ulladulla&#x27;s commercial area is located along Princes Highway and in surrounding streets featuring numerous clusters of shops. Ulladulla Shopping Centre features a Woolworths supermarket and eight speciality stores. Dolphin Court contains a Coles supermarket and seven speciality stores, next to it is The Reject Shop. Ulladulla also has an Aldi supermarket, Bunnings, Mitre 10, Best &amp; Less, Harris Scarfe and a K Hub store (formerly Target Country, closed February 2021). Ulladulla&#x27;s arcades are located on Princes Highway including Rowen&#x27;s Arcade which contain a cinema, Funland arcade and 23 speciality stores. Eastside Mall, Plaza, Riviera Arcade, Phillip Centre and Bellbrook Arcade are also located along Princes Highway.

==Education==
Ulladulla Public School was established in August 1861. Ulladulla High School was established in January 1974.

==Notable people==
*Winter Warden MLC (1860–1936), parliamentarian was born in Ulladulla
*Alexander Shand (1865–1949), barrister and King&#x27;s Counsel and Royal Commissioner was born in Ulladulla
*Colonel Alfred Warden VD (1868–1955), soldier, military engineer and architect was born in Ulladulla

==Media==
Ulladulla has since 1878 been served by weekly newspaper the &quot;Milton Ulladulla Times&quot;. Ulladulla receives five free-to-air television channels from Knights Hill, commercial channels Seven, WIN and Network 10, and public broadcasters ABC and SBS. Due to tropospheric ducting from Newcastle in the Shoalhaven area via Knights Hill, a translator site at Milton is an alternative source of television reception and assists those affected by the Newcastle ducting.

==Parliamentary representation==
Ulladulla is in the federal division of Gilmore, represented by Labor MP Fiona Phillips. Ulladulla is in the state seat of South Coast.

<text>Anne Bradstreet (née Dudley; March 8, 1612 – September 16, 1672) was among the most prominent of early English poets of North America and first writer in England&#x27;s North American colonies to be published. She is the first Puritan figure in American literature and notable for her large corpus of poetry, as well as personal writings published posthumously.

Born to a wealthy Puritan family in Northampton, England, Bradstreet was a well-read scholar especially affected by the works of Du Bartas. She was married at sixteen, and her parents and young family migrated at the time of the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. A mother of eight children and the wife and daughter of public officials in New England, Bradstreet wrote poetry in addition to her other duties.

Her early works are broadly considered derivative, but her later writings developed into her unique style of poetry which centers on her role as a mother, her struggles with the sufferings of life, and her Puritan faith. While her works were initially considered primarily of historical significance, she reached posthumous acclaim in the 20th century. Her first collection, &quot;The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America&quot;, was widely read in America and England.

==Background ==
In a portrait that was painted by her later poems, Bradstreet is described as &quot;an educated English woman, a kind, loving wife, devoted mother, Empress Consort of Massachusetts, a questing Puritan and a sensitive poet.&quot;

Bradstreet&#x27;s first volume of poetry was &quot;The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America&quot;, published in 1650. It was met with a positive reception in both the Old World and the New World.

===Life===
Anne was born in Northampton, England in 1612, the daughter of Thomas Dudley, a steward of the Earl of Lincoln, and Dorothy Yorke.

Due to her family&#x27;s position, she grew up in cultured circumstances and was a well-educated woman for her time, being tutored in history, several languages, and literature. At the age of sixteen she married Simon Bradstreet. Both Anne&#x27;s father and husband were later to serve as governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Anne and Simon, along with Anne&#x27;s parents, emigrated to America aboard the &quot;Arbella&quot; as part of the Winthrop Fleet of Puritan emigrants in 1630.

She first came to the Americas on June 14, 1630, at what is now Pioneer Village in Salem, Massachusetts, with Simon, her parents, and other voyagers as part of the Puritan migration to New England. Upon their arrival, they found that many of the colonists had died from illness or starvation the previous winter. Her family shared a one-room house with very little furniture or supplies.

The Bradstreet family soon moved again, this time to what is now Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1632, Anne had her first child, Samuel, in &quot;Newe Towne,&quot; as it was then called. Despite poor health, she had eight children and achieved a comfortable social standing. Having previously been afflicted with smallpox as a teenager in England, Anne would once again fall prey to illness as paralysis overtook her joints in later years. In the early 1640s, Simon once again pressed his wife, pregnant with her sixth child, to move for the sixth time, from Ipswich, Massachusetts, to Andover Parish. North Andover is that original town founded in 1646 by the Stevens, Osgood, Johnson, Farnum, Barker, and Bradstreet families, among others. Anne and her family resided in the Old Center of what is now North Andover, Massachusetts.

Both Anne&#x27;s father and her husband were instrumental in the founding of Harvard University in 1636; her father was a founder, and her husband an overseer. Two of her sons, Samuel (class of 1653) and Simon (c/o 1660), were graduates. In October 1997, the Harvard community dedicated a gate in memory of her as America&#x27;s first published poet. The gate was dedicated on the 25th anniversary of women being allowed in the Harvard Yard dorms. The Bradstreet Gate is located next to Canaday Hall in Harvard Yard.
In 1650, Rev. John Woodbridge had &quot;The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America&quot; composed by &quot;A Gentlewoman from Those Parts&quot; published in London, making Anne the first female poet ever published in both England and the New World. On July 10, 1666, their North Andover family home burned (see &quot;Works&quot; below) in a fire that left the Bradstreets homeless and with few personal belongings. Recent archaeological excavation may have located the site of this homestead, which had been the subject of uncertainty over the centuries. By then, Anne&#x27;s health was slowly failing. She suffered from tuberculosis and had to deal with the loss of cherished relatives. But her will remained strong and as a reflection of her religious devotion and knowledge of the Bible, she found peace in the firm belief that her daughter-in-law Mercy and her grandchildren were in heaven.

Anne Bradstreet died on September 16, 1672, in North Andover, Massachusetts, at the age of 60. The precise location of her grave is uncertain but many historians believe her body is in the Old Burying Ground at Academy Road and Osgood Street in North Andover. In 1676, four years after the death of Anne, Simon Bradstreet married for a second time to a woman also named Anne (Gardiner). In 1697, Simon died and was buried in Salem. This area of the Merrimack Valley is today described as &quot;The Valley of the Poets.&quot;

A marker in the North Andover cemetery commemorates the 350th anniversary (2000) of the publishing of &quot;The Tenth Muse&quot; in London in 1650. That site and the Bradstreet Gate at Harvard, the memorial and pamphlets inside the Ipswich Public Library in Ipswich, MA, as well as the Bradstreet Kindergarten in North Andover may be the only places in America honoring her memory.

As of 2015, the Bradstreet Kindergarten was torn down in North Andover. In the fall of 2018, The Anne Bradstreet Early Childhood Center was opened near Massachusetts Avenue in North Andover. Housing both preschool and kindergarten, the Anne Bradstreet ECC replaced the aged building named for her that had been on Main Street.

== Writing ==

===Background===
Anne Bradstreet&#x27;s education gave her advantages that allowed her to write with authority about politics, history, medicine, and theology. Her personal library of books was said to have numbered over 800, although many were destroyed when her home burned down. This event itself inspired a poem titled &quot;&quot;. At first, she rejects the anger and grief that this worldly tragedy has caused her; she looks toward God and the assurance of heaven as consolation, saying:
However, in opposition to her Puritan ways, she also shows her human side, expressing the pain this event had caused her, that is, until the poem comes to its end: 


As a younger poet, Bradstreet wrote five quaternions, epic poems of four parts each (see works below) that explore the diverse yet complementary natures of their subject. Much of Bradstreet&#x27;s poetry is based on observation of the world around her, focusing heavily on domestic and religious themes, and was considered by Cotton Mather &quot;a monument to her memory beyond the stateliest marble&quot;. Long considered primarily of historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems &quot;Contemplations&quot;, which was written for her family and not published until the mid-19th century.

Nearly a century later, Martha Wadsworth Brewster, a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, in her principal work, &quot;Poems on Diverse Subjects&quot;, was influenced and pays homage to Bradstreet&#x27;s verse.

Despite the traditional attitude toward women of the time, she clearly valued knowledge and intellect; she was a free thinker and some consider her an early feminist; unlike the more radical Anne Hutchinson, however, Bradstreet&#x27;s feminism does not reflect heterodox, antinomian views. 


In 1647, Bradstreet&#x27;s brother-in-law, Rev. John Woodbridge, sailed to England, carrying her manuscript of poetry. Although Anne later said that she did not know Woodbridge was going to publish her manuscript, in her self-deprecatory poem, &quot;The Author to Her Book&quot;, she wrote Woodbridge a letter while he was in London, indicating her knowledge of the publication plan. Anne had little choice, however— as a woman poet, it was important for her to downplay her ambitions as an author. Otherwise, she would have faced criticism for being &quot;unwomanly.&quot; Anne&#x27;s first work was published in London as &quot;The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America&quot; &quot;by a Gentlewoman of those Parts&quot;.

The purpose of the publication appears to have been an attempt by devout Puritan men (&quot;i.e.&quot; Thomas Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, John Woodbridge) to show that a godly and educated woman could elevate her position as a wife and mother, without necessarily placing her in competition with men. In 1678, her self-revised &quot;Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning&quot; was posthumously published in America, and included one of her most famous poems, &quot;&quot;. This volume is owned by the Stevens Memorial Library of North Andover and resides in the Houghton Library vault at Harvard.

A quotation from Bradstreet can be found on a plaque at the Bradstreet Gate in Harvard Yard: &quot;I came into this Country, where I found a new World and new manners at which my heart rose.&quot; Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is &quot;But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston.&quot; This suggests her heart rose up in protest rather than in joy.

===Role of women===
Marriage played a large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet&#x27;s poem, &quot;To My Dear And Loving Husband,&quot; she reveals that she is one with her husband. &quot;If ever two were one, then surely we.&quot; The Puritans believed marriage to be a gift from God. In another of Bradstreet&#x27;s works, &quot;Before the Birth of One of Her Children&quot;, Bradstreet acknowledges God&#x27;s gift of marriage in the lines, &quot;And if I see not half my days that&#x27;s due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you&quot;. Bradstreet could be referring to her husband remarrying after she dies. Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, &quot;These O protect from stepdame&#x27;s injury&quot;, Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future stepmother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage.

Throughout &quot;Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment,&quot; Bradstreet states how she feels lost when her husband is not around and that life is always better when he is around. In Bradstreet&#x27;s poems, it can be assumed she truly loved her husband and missed him when he was away from her and the family. Bradstreet does not resent her husband for leaving her with the family and with all of the household needs; she just misses him and wants him back with her.

Various works of Bradstreet are dedicated to her children. In works such as &quot;Before the Birth of One of Her Children&quot; and &quot;In Reference to Her Children&quot;, Bradstreet articulated the love that she has for her children, both unborn and born. In Puritan society, children were also gifts from God, and she loved and cared for all of her children just as she loved and cared for her husband. She always believes they too are bound with her to make &quot;one.&quot;

===Reception===
As writing was not considered to be an acceptable role for women at the time, Bradstreet was met with criticism. One of the most prominent figures of her time, John Winthrop, criticized Ann Hopkins, wife of prominent Connecticut colony governor Edward Hopkins. He mentioned in his journal that Hopkins should have kept to being a housewife and left writing and reading for men, &quot;whose minds are stronger.&quot; Despite heavy criticism of women during her time, Bradstreet continued to write, which led to the belief that she was interested in rebelling against societal norms of the time. A prominent minister of the time, Thomas Parker, was also against the idea of women writing and sent a letter to his own sister saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were supposed to do. No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.

==Literary style and themes==

===Background===

Bradstreet let her homesick imagination marshall her store of learning, for the glory of God and for the expression of an inquiring mind and sensitive, philosophical spirit.

We see examples of this homesick imagination in her poem &quot;Dialogue Between Old England and New&quot; which emphasizes the relationship between the motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue. It also implies that whatever happens to England will also affect America. The poem often refers to England as &quot;mother&quot; and America as &quot;Daughter&quot;, which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country.

===Intended audience===
Anne Bradstreet&#x27;s works tend to be directed to members of her family and are generally intimate. For instance, in Bradstreet&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the poem&#x27;s intended audience is her husband, Simon Bradstreet. In &quot;A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment&quot; Bradstreet writes a letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to describe her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer can be seen as a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet&#x27;s husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. &quot;Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn.&quot; She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can&#x27;t be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband&#x27;s job is important. He can&#x27;t be there always and he must go away at times. &quot;Till nature&#x27;s sad decree shall call thee hence.&quot;

Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed.

Bradstreet was not responsible for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her work off to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry was not meant to bring attention to herself.

===Themes===

The role of women is a common subject found in Bradstreet&#x27;s poems. Living in a Puritan society, Bradstreet did not approve of the
stereotypical idea that women were inferior to men during the 1600s. Women were expected to spend all their time cooking, cleaning, taking care of their children, and attending to their husband&#x27;s every need. In her poem &quot;In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,&quot; Bradstreet questions this belief.

&quot;Now say, have women worth? or have they none?
Or had they some, but with our queen is&#x27;t gone?
Nay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long,
But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong,
Let such as say our Sex is void of Reason,
Know tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.&quot;

Another recurring subject in Bradstreet&#x27;s work is mortality. In many of her works, she writes about her death and how it will affect her children and others in her life. The recurrence of this mortality theme can be viewed as autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, she was referring to her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings. She hoped her children would think of her fondly and honor her memory in her poem, &quot;Before the Birth of One of Her Children.&quot;
 &quot;If any worth or virtue were in me,
 Let that live freshly in thy memory.&quot;

Bradstreet is also known for using her poetry as a means to question her own Puritan beliefs; her doubt concerning God&#x27;s mercy and her struggles to continue to place her faith in him are exemplified in such poems as &quot;Verses upon the Burning of our House&quot; and &quot;In Memory of My Dear Grandchild&quot;. Her works demonstrate a conflict that many Puritans would not have felt comfortable discussing, let alone writing.

In &quot;The Prologue,&quot; Bradstreet demonstrates how society trivialized the accomplishments of women. The popular belief that women should be doing other things like sewing, rather than writing poetry.

&quot;I am obnoxious to each carping tongue
Who says my hand a needle better fits,
A poet&#x27;s pen all scorn I should thus wrong.
For such despite they cast on female wits:
If what I do prove well, it won&#x27;t advance,
They&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s stol&#x27;n, or else it was by chance.&quot;

In &quot;To My Dear and Loving Husband,&quot; Bradstreet confesses her undying love for Simon saying &quot;Thy love is such I can no way repay, The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.&quot; Her deep passions can be found again in &quot;A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment.&quot; Her overt affections for her husband help readers to understand Bradstreet&#x27;s temerity.

Anne Bradstreet wrote in a different format than other writers of her time. This mainly is due to the fact that she wrote her feelings in a book not knowing someone would read them. In her poem &quot;A letter to my Husband&quot; she speaks about the loss of her husband when he is gone.

&quot;I like the earth this season morn in black, my sun is gone.&quot; Here Anne is expressing her feelings of missing her husband when he is away.

&quot;To my faults that well you know I have let be interred in my oblivious grave; if any worth of virtue were in me, let that live freshly in they memory&quot;. Anne expresses the feeling she has of wanting her children to remember her in a good light not in a bad light.

===Tone===
Bradstreet often used a sarcastic tone in her poetry. In the first
stanza of &quot;The Prologue&quot; she claims &quot;for my mean pen are too
superior things&quot; referring to society&#x27;s belief that she is unfit to
write about wars and the founding of cities because she is a woman. In
stanza five Bradstreet continues to display irony by stating &quot;who says
my hand a needle better fits&quot;. This is another example of her
sarcastic voice because society during this time expected women to
perform household chores rather than write poetry.

Although Anne Bradstreet endured many hardships in her life, her poems
are usually written in a hopeful and positive tone. Throughout her
poem In &quot;Memory of My Dear Grandchild Simon Bradstreet,&quot; she mentions
that even though she has lost her grandson in this world, she
will one day be reunited with him in Heaven. In &quot;Upon the
Burning of Our House,&quot; Bradstreet describes her house in flames but
selflessly declares &quot;there&#x27;s wealth enough, I need no more.&quot; Although
Bradstreet lost many of her material items she kept a positive
attitude and found strength through her belief in God.

===Quaternions===
Bradstreet wrote four quaternions, &quot;Seasons,&quot; &quot;Elements,&quot; &quot;Humours,&quot; and &quot;Ages,&quot; which made possible her &quot;development as a poet in terms of technical craftsmanship as she learned to fashion the form artistically.&quot;

Bradstreet&#x27;s first two quaternions were her most successful. The central tension in her work is that between delight in the world and belief of its vanity.

<text>The French Congo (), also known as Middle Congo (), was a French colony which at one time comprised the present-day area of the Republic of the Congo and parts of Gabon, and the Central African Republic. In 1910, it was made part of the larger French Equatorial Africa.

The modern Republic of the Congo is considered French Congo&#x27;s successor state, having virtually identical borders, and having inherited rights to sovereignty and independence from France through the dissolution of French Equatorial Africa in the late 1950s.

==History==

The French Congo began at Brazzaville on 10 September 1880 as a protectorate over the Bateke people along the north bank of the Congo River. The treaty was signed between King Iloo I and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza; Iloo I died the same year it was signed, but the terms of the treaty were upheld by his queen Ngalifourou. It was formally established as the French Congo on 30 November 1882, and was confirmed at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85. Its borders with Cabinda, Cameroons, and the Congo Free State were established by treaties over the next decade. The plan to develop the colony was to grant massive concessions to some thirty French companies. These were granted huge swaths of land on the promise they would be developed. This development was limited and amounted mostly to the extraction of ivory, rubber, and timber. These operations often involved great brutality and the near-enslavement of the locals.

Even with these measures most of the companies lost money. Only about ten earned profits. Many of the companies&#x27; vast holdings existed only on paper with virtually no presence on the ground in Africa.

The French Congo was sometimes known as Gabon-Congo. It formally added Gabon on in 1891, was officially renamed Middle Congo () in 1903, was temporarily divorced from Gabon in 1906, and was then reunited as French Equatorial Africa in 1910 in an attempt to emulate the relative success of French West Africa.

In 1911 the Morocco-Congo Treaty gave part of the territory to Germany for an outlet on the Congo River. This land, known as Neukamerun, was officially regained by France after the First World War.

A 1906 study , was published in conjunction with the French Colonial Exposition in Marseille. In 1925 African-American historian, sociologist, and Pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois wrote &quot;&#x27;Batouala&#x27; voices it. In the depths of the French Congo one finds the same exploitation of black folk as in the Belgian Congo or British West Africa.&quot;

<doc id="333518" wikidata="Q7574256" url="?curid=333518" title="Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives">
<text>The speaker of the Australian House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the Australian House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The counterpart in the upper house is the president of the Senate. The office of the speakership was established in 1901 by section 35 of the Constitution of Australia. The primary responsibilities of the office is to oversee house debates, determine which members may speak, maintain order and the parliamentary and ministerial codes of conduct during sessions and uphold all rules and standing orders. The current speaker of the House of Representatives is Milton Dick, who was elected on 26 July 2022.

==Election==
The Speaker is elected by the House of Representatives in a secret ballot, with an election held whenever the Office of the Speaker is vacant, as set out in Chapter 3 of the House of Representatives Standing and Sessional Orders. The Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives conducts the election. The MPs who move and second the nomination of the successful candidate symbolically drag them to the chair after their election, in accordance with a tradition carried over from Westminster.

Unlike the Speaker of the House of Commons in Britain, the Speaker generally remains an active member of their party. If a party member, the Speaker may continue to attend party meetings, and at general elections will stand as a party candidate. There were two exceptions to this: the first Speaker, Frederick Holder (1901) and Peter Slipper (2011), who resigned from their respective parties upon election as Speaker, and sat as independents.

A Speaker ceases to hold that office if, for any reason, they cease to be a member of the House. There is no convention in Australia that the Speaker should not be opposed in their seat, and three Speakers have been defeated at general elections: Littleton Groom (1929), Walter Nairn (1943) and William Aston (1972). Because the Speaker is always the nominee of the governing party, there is no expectation that a Speaker will continue in office following a change of government. While the Opposition usually nominates one of its own members for Speaker after a general election, this is understood to be a symbolic act, and party discipline is always followed in any ballot.

By reason of section 40 of the Constitution, while in the Chair, a Speaker does not have a deliberative vote, but if there is a tie in votes, the Speaker has a tiebreaker (or casting) vote.

Most Speakers have been senior backbenchers of the party holding office at the start of a new Parliament, or at the time of the death or resignation of an incumbent Speaker. Five Speakers have been former government ministers: William Watt, Littleton Groom, Archie Cameron, Ian Sinclair and Bronwyn Bishop; two have been former Parliamentary Secretaries: Stephen Martin and Tony Smith; and one both a former minister and a former Leader of the Opposition: Billy Snedden. Two were former state premiers: Holder and Watt. There is no convention in Australia that Speakers should resign from Parliament at the end of their term; two Speakers have become Cabinet ministers after having been Speaker: Norman Makin and Gordon Scholes.

Bronwyn Bishop was elected Speaker on 12 November 2013, as the Coalition&#x27;s first female Speaker of the House and the third female Speaker, after Labor&#x27;s Joan Child (1986–89) and Anna Burke (2012–13). The 43rd Parliament (2010–13) was the first Australian federal parliament to have had three Speakers: Harry Jenkins (elected September 2010), Peter Slipper (November 2011), and Anna Burke (October 2012).

All male Speakers have been addressed by members as &quot;Mister Speaker&quot; while in the Chair. Joan Child chose to be addressed as &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;, as female Speakers are usually referred to in other parliaments. Anna Burke broke with this tradition and ruled that her official form of address is merely &quot;Speaker.&quot;

===Election results===

















==Role==

The Speaker&#x27;s principal duty is to preside over the House and maintain order in the House, uphold Standing Orders (rules of procedure), rule on points of order, and protect the rights of backbench members.

Australian parliaments are notoriously rowdy, and the Speaker frequently exercises the disciplinary powers vested in them under Standing Orders. The Speaker may summarily order a Member to excuse themself from the House for one hour. For more serious offences, the Speaker may &quot;name&quot; a Member, saying &quot;I name the Honourable Member for X,&quot; following the House&#x27;s convention that Members are always referred to by their electorate. The House then votes on a motion to suspend the Member for 24 hours. (The House also had the power to permanently expel a Member, but this happened only once, in 1920: the member was Hugh Mahon. The House no longer has the power to expel a member from membership of the House under Section 8 of the &quot;Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987&quot;.)

The Speaker, in conjunction with the President of the Senate, also administers Parliament House, Canberra, with the assistance of an administrative staff in the Australian parliamentary departments. The Speaker has accountability obligations to the Parliament for the Department of the House of Representatives. Together with the President, the Speaker also had such accountability obligations to the Parliament in respect of the Department of Parliamentary Services.

A member of the House who wishes to resign would tender their resignation to the Speaker (but not to an Acting Speaker), or if there is no Speaker to the Governor-General. During the Joint Sitting of 1974 the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives Jim Cope was the presiding officer.

==Impartiality==
While impartial, the Speaker does not usually quit the membership of their party like the Speaker of the House of Commons. Although the first Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder, resigned from the Free Trade Party upon taking the role in accordance with traditional Westminster convention, subsequent speakers did not follow this convention. The only other speaker to date who resigned from their party was Peter Slipper, chosen from the opposition, who resigned from the Liberal Party the day after his election to the chair.

On the other hand, the Speaker is not an active political figure like the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. They do not take part in debates in the House, do not vote in the House except in the (relatively infrequent) event of a tied vote, and do not speak in public on party-political issues (except at election time in their own constituency). They are expected to conduct the business of the House in an impartial manner, and generally do so.

There have been several memorable clashes between Speakers and the governments:

*In 1929 Speaker Littleton Groom declined to come into the House and cast a vote in committee of the whole (what is now known as consideration in detail ) when his vote would have saved the Bruce government from defeat. As a result, he was expelled from the Nationalist Party and defeated in his constituency at the subsequent election.
*In 1975 the Whitlam government refused to support Speaker Jim Cope when he named government minister Clyde Cameron for disrespect to the Chair: normally this would have resulted in the minister&#x27;s suspension from the House. The Speaker resigned on the spot. This is the only occasion on which a Government failed to support a Speaker after a Member had been named.
*In 1982 Speaker Billy Snedden refused to insist that an opposition frontbencher, Bob Hawke, retract an allegation that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, was a liar. Snedden stood his ground despite furious demands from government members that Hawke either be made to retract or be named.
* In 2011, a Speaker survived being countermanded by the House. After a contentious debate on carbon pricing in which Speaker Harry Jenkins declared a &quot;general warning&quot; for all members, Liberal MP Bob Baldwin interjected and was named by the Speaker. The Government accordingly moved that he be suspended, but Baldwin was supported by the Coalition, independent MP Rob Oakeshott and WA Nationals MP Tony Crook. The resulting vote on suspending Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71–72. Convention would normally have required the Speaker to resign, but the House of Representatives immediately thereafter passed a motion of confidence in the Speaker, and as a consequence, Speaker Jenkins continued in office.

===Speakers of or from opposition parties===
While speakers normally come from the governing party, there have been several exceptions.

Peter Slipper was a member of the Liberal Party when elected as Speaker, but resigned a day later. Slipper&#x27;s elevation to the speakership occurred due to the hung parliament resulting from the 2010 election, which saw the ALP form a minority government.

In the previous hung parliament elected at the 1940 election, the United Australia Party&#x27;s Walter Nairn continued as Speaker when the ALP formed a new government in the middle of the parliamentary term.

Opposition MP Carty Salmon initially served as speaker for the first federal Australian majority government, the Andrew Fisher Labor government, resulting from the 1910 election.

At the 1913 election, Labor&#x27;s Charles McDonald was offered retention of the Speakership by the incoming one-seat-majority Commonwealth Liberal Party, but declined – later however, after Labor&#x27;s return to government at the 1914 election, McDonald regained the Speakership until the subsequent election in 1917 despite the mid-term change to a Nationalist Party government.

==Entitlements==
The speaker&#x27;s salary is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body. As of 1 July 2019, the incumbent is entitled to a parliamentarian&#x27;s base salary of A$211,250 plus an additional 75% loading, equating to a salary of approximately $369,700. Assuming they hold no other positions, the deputy speaker has a salary of $253,500 (20% loading), the second deputy speaker $238,700 (13% loading), and members of the speaker&#x27;s panel $217,600 (3% loading).

A member elected speaker is entitled to the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; while in office, which, with the approval of the King of Australia, may be retained for life. This privilege is usually only given to those who have served as speaker for at least three years. Harry Jenkins Jr. was the first speaker to ask that &quot;The Honourable&quot; title not be used in reference to him, while also making clear that he was not attempting to set a precedent for future speakers; he was simply not personally comfortable with the title.

==Official dress==

Following the Westminster tradition inherited from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the traditional dress of the Speaker includes components of Court dress such as a black silk lay-type gown (similar to a King&#x27;s Counsel gown), a wing collar and a lace jabot or bands (another variation included a white bow tie with a lace jabot), bar jacket, and a full-bottomed wig. The wig available for use by the speaker was used by Herbert &#x27;Doc&#x27; Evatt when he was a High Court Justice (1930–1940) and was donated to the Parliament by Evatt when he was elected to the House in 1951. The wig is currently on loan from the speaker&#x27;s office to the Museum of Australian Democracy. Another addition used by earlier speakers, though only for the most formal occasions, included court shoes and hose.

The dress of Speakers has often varied according to the party in power and the personal choice of the Speaker. All Labor Speakers have eschewed the traditional dress in favour of ordinary business attire as appropriate for a member of parliament, following the example set by their first Speaker, Charles McDonald. Most non-Labor Speakers before 2012 wore some variation of the traditional dress.

Billy Snedden (1976–1983) was the last Speaker to wear the full traditional attire of the Speaker, complete with the wig. On the election of the Howard government in 1996, the new Speaker, Bob Halverson, chose to wear the Speaker&#x27;s traditional attire upon his election in April 1996, but without the wig. Speaker Ian Sinclair opted to wear a gown, albeit of a simpler academic style, during his brief term in 1998, a practice mirrored by his successors, Neil Andrew and David Hawker. Upon his election in late 2011, Peter Slipper went a step toward restoring the traditional dress by wearing a gown and bar jacket over his business attire. Slipper also took to wearing a white long tie or bow tie, in a variation from the lace jabot or bands. For example, he wore a wing collar with white bow tie and bands on the occasion of his first formal procession into parliament. Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, the first non-Labor woman to hold the post, opted for business attire with no gown after her election in 2013. Subsequent Coalition speakers, Tony Smith and Andrew Wallace, likewise opted for business attire.

==List of speakers of the House of Representatives==

The following is a list of speakers of the House of Representatives.

==Assistants to the speaker==
The House elects two of its members to serve as deputy speaker and second deputy speaker. The speaker also nominates a number of other MPs to assist with chairing proceedings of the House and Federation Chamber, who form the speaker&#x27;s panel. In order for business to proceed, the House may choose any member to take the chair if the speaker is absent and the previously deputised members are unavailable; this is rare. Any member chairing the House in the absence of the speaker or deputy speakers is addressed as &quot;Acting Deputy Speaker&quot;. However, only the deputy and second deputy speakers can serve as &quot;acting speaker&quot;, with the full powers of the position.

===Election===
The election of either the deputy speaker and second deputy speaker is held when the respective position is vacant. If both positions of deputy speaker and second deputy speaker are vacant (for example at the start of each parliament), then the elections for deputy speaker and second deputy speaker are conducted together in one election. The runner-up in such an election is then deemed to have been elected second deputy speaker.

Until July 2019 (except for a short period between October 2012 and November 2013), standing order 13(c) of the House stated that only a non-government MP may be a second deputy speaker. This comes from the usual convention that the deputy speaker is a government MP, and a non-government MP as the second deputy speaker would &quot;allow people from opposing sides in the two roles of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker&quot;, as quoted by Labor MP Anthony Albanese. Since 1943, there were only two occasions when the deputy speaker was not held by a government MP, both during the 43rd Parliament when Labor was in minority government. The first occasion was at the start of the 43rd Parliament in September 2010, when Peter Slipper of the Liberal Party was nominated by Labor and defeated Bruce Scott of the National Party to be the deputy speaker. Scott continued to be the second deputy speaker. In this occasion, both positions were held by non-government MPs.

The second occasion was on 9 October 2012, when Scott defeated Labor MP and nominee Steve Georganas and became the deputy speaker. The following day, the House voted to remove standing order 13(c) to allow Georganas (government MP) to be elected as second deputy speaker. Both Scott and Georganas stayed in their roles for the rest of the 43rd Parliament. Standing order 13(c) was reinstated at the start of the 44th Parliament in November 2013.

Standing order 13(c) was altered on 4 July 2019 with bipartisan support. The new standing order, current , states that if a government MP was elected as deputy speaker, then only a non-government MP may be elected as second deputy speaker. Likewise, if a non-government MP was elected as deputy speaker, then only a government MP may be elected as second deputy speaker.

The deputy speakership election held on 10 February 2020 was unique in that the winner Llew O&#x27;Brien (nominated by Labor) and the runner-up Damian Drum (nominated by the Coalition government) were both government MPs. As the election was only for the deputy speakership position (the second deputy speaker position was not vacant), Drum was not elected as second deputy speaker. Otherwise, this would have been against standing order 13(c).

===Deputy speaker===

The position of deputy speaker was created in 1994 in place of the former position of &quot;chairman of committees&quot;, which had existed since the first parliament in 1901. This coincided with the establishment of the Main Committee (now renamed the Federation Chamber).The deputy speaker has the same procedural powers as the speaker while in the chair, including signing messages from the House to the Senate. As well as deputising for the speaker, the deputy speaker chairs the Federation Chamber.

Following the 2022 federal election, Sharon Claydon was elected as deputy speaker.

====List of deputy speakers and chairmen of committees====
The title of the office was originally &quot;chairman of committees&quot;. This was changed to &quot;deputy speaker and chairman of committees&quot; on 3 November 1992 and to simply &quot;deputy speaker&quot; on 21 February 1994. The terms of deputy speakers technically coincide with terms of parliament, however for the purposes of the table below terms spanning multiple parliaments are deemed to be continuous. Prior to 10 July 1907 the chairman of committees was elected on a sessional basis.

===Second deputy speaker===
The position of second deputy speaker was created in 1994, primarily as an assistant to the deputy speaker in the Federation Chamber.

====List of second deputy speakers====
The terms of second deputy speakers technically coincide with terms of parliament, however for the purposes of the table below terms spanning multiple parliaments are deemed to be continuous.

===Speaker&#x27;s panel===
The speaker&#x27;s panel consists of at least four MPs nominated by the speaker at the start of each parliament. The speaker may nominate additional members or revoke membership at any point during the parliament. Members of the panel are called on to chair meetings of the House at the request of the speaker, as well as meetings of the Federation Chamber at the request of the deputy speaker or second deputy speaker. A roster is maintained so that the chair can always be filled. Members of the panel will relinquish the chair to the speaker or deputy speaker &quot;if disorder arises or if special circumstances apply&quot;.

Historically, the speaker has nominated both government and opposition MPs to the speaker&#x27;s panel. However, after the 2010 and 2013 elections opposition members refused to serve on the panel. The practice resumed later in the 2013–16 parliamentary term.

<text>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Latin, &#x27;Library of Alexandria&#x27;; , ) (BA) is a major library and cultural center on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea in Alexandria, Egypt. It is a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria, once one of the largest libraries worldwide, which was lost in antiquity. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina contains books in classical Arabic, English, and French languages.

The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974 when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library. Construction work began in 1995, and after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002. In 2009, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world.

The library offers shelf space for eight million books, and its main reading room spans 20,000 square meters (220,000 sq ft). The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory.

==History==
The idea of reviving the Library of Alexandria dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library between the campus and the seafront, close to where the ancient library once stood. One leading supporter of the project was former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, along with a partnership with UNESCO.

UNESCO organized an architectural design competition in 1988 to choose the design. The competition was won by Snøhetta, a Norwegian architectural office, among 524 other entries. UNESCO also created an International Commission for the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The first pledges were made for funding the project at a conference held in 1990 in Aswan along the upper Nile River with US$65 million, mostly from the MENA states. Construction work began in 1995, and, after some additional US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002.

The Internet Archive donated US$5 million to the BA, including 10 billion web pages from over 16 million sites, 2000 hours of Egyptian and U.S. television broadcasts, 1000 archival films, 100 terabytes of data stored on 200 computers, and a bookscanning facility for local books. The library also received a supplementary donation of 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. 

==Features==
The library has shelf space for eight million books, with the main reading room covering on eleven cascading levels. The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory.

The main reading room stands beneath a 32-meter-high glass-panelled roof, tilted out toward the sea like a sundial, and measuring some 160 m in diameter. The walls are of gray granite, carved with characters from 120 scripts.

==Services==
The main library can hold up to eight million books. The library provides access to print on demand books via the Espresso Book Machine.

The Taha Hussein Library contains materials for the blind and visually impaired using special software that makes it possible for readers to read books and journals. It is named after Taha Hussein, the Egyptian professor of Arabic and literary critic who was himself blinded at the age of three.

Contains book collections of Nobel Prize Laureates in Literature from 1901. The Nobel Section was inaugurated by Queen Silvia of Sweden and Queen Sonja of Norway on 24 April 2002.

=== Museums===
====Antiquities Museum====
Established in 2001, the Antiquities Museum is an archeological museum that was situated within a library. It held approximately 1,316 artifacts. The collection includes underwater antiquities from the Mediterranean seabed near the Eastern Harbour and the Bay of Abukir. The museum provides descriptions of artifacts in three languages: English, Arabic, and French.

====Manuscript Museum====
The Manuscript Museum provides visitors and researchers with rare manuscripts and books. Established in 2001, the Manuscript Museum contains the world&#x27;s largest collection of digital manuscripts. The Manuscript Museum operates alongside the Manuscript Center.

====Sadat Museum====

This museum contains many personal belongings of the Egyptian president, Anwar Al Sadat. The collections include some of his military robes, his Nobel Prize medal, his copy of the Qur&#x27;an, a few of his handwritten letters, pictures of him and his family, and the blood-stained military robe he wore on the day of his assassination. The museum also contains a recording in his voice of part of the Qur&#x27;an and assorted newspaper articles written about him.

===Permanent exhibitions===
The Our Digital World exhibition displays some of the library&#x27;s digital projects, including digital archives of former presidents, the Science Supercourse, and the Encyclopedia of Life. Additionally, digital versions of books, such as &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Art Arabe&quot;, are available.

The World of Shadi Abdel Salam exhibition contains works of Egyptian film director and screenwriter Shadi Abdel Salam. The work was donated by his family. The Impressions of Alexandria exhibition is divided into two sections: &quot;Alexandria as seen by Artists and Travelers&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan Alexandria: a Photographic Memory&quot;.

The Culturama is a hall that consists of a 180-degree panoramic interactive computer screen with a diameter of 10 meters that is made up of nine separate flat screens arranged in a semicircle and nine video projectors controlled by a single computer. It was developed by the Egyptian Center for Documentation of Cultural and CULTNAT and holds its patent in 2007.

=== Digital Assets Repository ===
The Digital Assets Repository (DAR) is a system developed at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina by the International School of Information Science (ISIS) that maintains a digital library collections as well as providing free public access to the library&#x27;s digitized collections through web-based search and browsing facilities via DAR&#x27;s website.

==Management==
Per Presidential Decree No. 76 in 2001, the Bibliotheca Alexandria is managed by a Council of Patrons, a Board of Trustees, and a Director. The founding director was Ismail Serageldin, who served until May 2017. He was succeeded by manager Moustafa El Feqy.

The Board of Trustees shall number no less than fifteen and no more than thirty, of whom five shall be ex-officio members of the Egyptian Government, namely the Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, the Minister of Culture, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Governor of Alexandria and the President of the University of Alexandria.

==Post-revolutionary involvement==

While the library was shut down during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, young adults were seen in a circle around the building to protect against looters and vandals. Students from neighboring universities make up 80% of Bibliotheca Alexandrina patrons. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina held a variety of symposiums in 2011, emphasizing the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Other topics included in these symposiums were social work. All of these events were freely available to the public.

==Criticism==
Many allege that the library is a white elephant, which serves little more than a vanity project for the Egyptian government. Furthermore, there are fears that censorship would affect the library&#x27;s collection.

The building&#x27;s architecture (which imitates a rising sun) upset some who believed too much money was being spent on construction rather than the library&#x27;s actual collection. Due to the lack of available funds, the library had only 500,000 books in 2002; however, in 2010, the library received an additional 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France. The library relies on donations to buy books for its collections.

<doc id="333528" wikidata="Q6158790" url="?curid=333528" title="Japanese language and computers">
<text>In relation to the Japanese language and computers many adaptation issues arise, some unique to Japanese and others common to languages which have a very large number of characters. The number of characters needed in order to write in English is quite small, and thus it is possible to use only one byte (28=256 possible values) to encode each English character. However, the number of characters in Japanese is many more than 256 and thus cannot be encoded using a single byte - Japanese is thus encoded using two or more bytes, in a so-called &quot;double byte&quot; or &quot;multi-byte&quot; encoding. Problems that arise relate to transliteration and romanization, character encoding, and input of Japanese text.

==Character encodings==
There are several standard methods to encode Japanese characters for use on a computer, including JIS, Shift-JIS, EUC, and Unicode. While mapping the set of kana is a simple matter, kanji has proven more difficult. Despite efforts, none of the encoding schemes have become the de facto standard, and multiple encoding standards were in use by the 2000s. As of 2017, the share of UTF-8 traffic on the Internet has expanded to over 90% worldwide, and only 1.2% was for using Shift-JIS and EUC. Yet, a few popular websites including 2channel and kakaku.com are still using Shift-JIS.

Until 2000s, most Japanese emails were in ISO-2022-JP (&quot;JIS encoding&quot;) and web pages in Shift-JIS and mobile phones in Japan usually used some form of Extended Unix Code. If a program fails to determine the encoding scheme employed, it can cause and thus unreadable text on computers.
The first encoding to become widely used was JIS X 0201, which is a single-byte encoding that only covers standard 7-bit ASCII characters with half-width katakana extensions. This was widely used in systems that were neither powerful enough nor had the storage to handle kanji (including old embedded equipment such as cash registers) because Kana-Kanji conversion required a complicated process, and output in kanji required much memory and high resolution. This means that only katakana, not kanji, was supported using this technique. Some embedded displays still have this limitation.

The development of kanji encodings was the beginning of the split. Shift JIS supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with JIS X 0201, and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment. However, Shift JIS has the unfortunate property that it often breaks any parser (software that reads the coded text) that is not specifically designed to handle it. 

For example, some Shift-JIS characters include a backslash (0x5C &quot;\&quot;) in the second byte, which is used as an escape character in many programming languages. 
A parser lacking support for Shift JIS will recognize 0x5C 0x82 as an invalid escape sequence, and remove it. Therefore, the phrase cause mojibake.

This can happen for example in the C programming language, when having Shift-JIS in text strings. It does not happen in HTML since ASCII 0x00–0x3F (which includes &quot;, %, &amp; and some other used escape characters and string separators) do not appear as second byte in Shift-JIS, and backslash is not an escape characters there. But it can happen for JavaScript which can be embedded in HTML pages.

EUC, on the other hand, is handled much better by parsers that have been written for 7-bit ASCII (and thus EUC encodings are used on UNIX, where much of the file-handling code was historically only written for English encodings). But EUC is not backwards compatible with JIS X 0201, the first main Japanese encoding. Further complications arise because the original Internet e-mail standards only support 7-bit transfer protocols. Thus (&quot;ISO-2022-JP&quot;, often simply called JIS encoding) was developed for sending and receiving e-mails.
In character set standards such as JIS, not all required characters are included, so gaiji ( &quot;external characters&quot;) are sometimes used to supplement the character set. Gaiji may come in the form of external font packs, where normal characters have been replaced with new characters, or the new characters have been added to unused character positions. However, gaiji are not practical in Internet environments since the font set must be transferred with text to use the gaiji. As a result, such characters are written with similar or simpler characters in place, or the text may need to be encoded using a larger character set (such as Unicode) that supports the required character.

Unicode was intended to solve all encoding problems over all languages. The UTF-8 encoding used to encode Unicode in web pages does not have the disadvantages that Shift-JIS has. Unicode is supported by international software, and it eliminates the need for gaiji. There are still controversies, however. For Japanese, the kanji characters have been unified with Chinese; that is, a character considered to be the same in both Japanese and Chinese is given a single number, even if the appearance is actually somewhat different, with the precise appearance left to the use of a locale-appropriate font. This process, called Han unification, has caused controversy. The previous encodings in Japan, Taiwan Area, Mainland China and Korea have only handled one language and Unicode should handle all. The handling of Kanji/Chinese have however been designed by a committee composed of representatives from all four countries/areas.

== Text input ==

Written Japanese uses several different scripts: kanji (Chinese characters), 2 sets of &quot;kana&quot; (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed directly into a computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as there are far more kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an input method editor (IME), also sometimes known as a front-end processor, shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via romanization (&quot;rōmaji nyūryoku,&quot; ) or direct kana input (&quot;kana nyūryoku,&quot; ). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices – each of the 10 digits (1–9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the gojūon table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.

There are two main systems for the romanization of Japanese, known as &quot;Kunrei-shiki&quot; and &quot;Hepburn&quot;; in practice, &quot;keyboard romaji&quot; (also known as &quot;wāpuro rōmaji&quot; or &quot;word processor romaji&quot;) generally allows a loose combination of both. IME implementations may even handle keys for letters unused in any romanization scheme, such as &quot;L&quot;, converting them to the most appropriate equivalent. With kana input, each key on the keyboard directly corresponds to one kana. The JIS keyboard system is the national standard, but there are alternatives, like the thumb-shift keyboard, commonly used among professional typists.

== Direction of text ==

Japanese can be written in two directions. &quot;Yokogaki&quot; style writes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as with English. &quot;Tategaki&quot; style writes first top-to-bottom, and then moves right-to-left.

To compete with Ichitaro, Microsoft provided several updates for early Japanese versions of Microsoft Word including support for downward text, such as Word 5.0 Power Up Kit and Word 98.

QuarkXPress was the most popular DTP software in Japan in 1990s, even it had a long development cycle. However, due to lacking support for downward text, it was surpassed by Adobe InDesign which had strong support for downward text through several updates.

At present, handling of downward text is incomplete. For example, HTML has no support for &quot;tategaki&quot; and Japanese users must use HTML tables to simulate it. However, CSS level 3 includes a property &quot;codice_1&quot; which can render &quot;tategaki&quot; when given the value &quot;codice_2&quot; (i.e. top to bottom, right to left). Word processors and DTP software have more complete support for it.

== Historical development ==
The lack of proper Japanese character support on computers limited the influence of large American firms in the Japanese market during the 1980s. Japan, which had been the world&#x27;s second largest market for computers after the United States at the time, was dominated by domestic hardware and software makers such as NEC and Fujitsu. Microsoft Windows 3.1 offered improved Japanese language support which played a part in reducing the grip of domestic PC makers throughout the 1990s.

<text>Rakiura National Park is a nature reserve park located on Stewart Island / Rakiura, New Zealand. It is the newest national park of New Zealand and opened in 2002. The protected area covers about 85% of the island.

==History==
===Park establishment===

Rakiura National Park is the 14th of New Zealand&#x27;s national parks and was officially opened on 9 March 2002 by the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, the Minister of Conservation, Sandra Lee, and the mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary. It is New Zealand&#x27;s newest national park.

==Geography==
Rakiura National Park covers close to , which is about 85% of Stewart Island / Rakiura, New Zealand&#x27;s third-largest island. The park area excludes the township area around Halfmoon Bay (Oban) and some roads as well as private or Māori-owned land further inland. It is made up of a network of former nature reserves, scenic reserves, and State Forest areas.
A chain sculpture at the entrance to Rakiura National Park symbolises the Māori mythology of the island, which held that the South Island was the canoe of the demigod Māui and that Rakiura was the canoe&#x27;s anchor, as evidenced by an alternative name for the island of &quot;Te Punga o Te Waka a Māui&quot; (the anchor of Māui&#x27;s canoe). The sculpture was designed by noted Southland sculptor Russell Beck, and was unveiled as part of the opening of the national park. In 2008, a similar sculpture was erected in Bluff, and it represents the other end of the chain.

==Ecology==
=== Fauna ===
Many native birds can be found within the park, and Rakiura offers perhaps the best opportunity anywhere in New Zealand for viewing kiwi in the wild. This is in part due to the absence of stoats and ferrets. Home to the Southern brown kiwi or Tokoeka, this is the largest of the kiwi species. There are thought to be around 15,000 kiwi on Stewart Island / Rakiura.

Certain coastal areas of this park are breeding areas for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin. Weka, a flightless and curious bird species, can only be found on offshore islands. The South Island kākā can commonly be seen near the town of Halfmoon Bay and Ulva Island.

In the 1970s, kākāpō were found in the Tin Range at a time when it was thought that the species was nearly extinct. The kākāpō have been transferred to nearby Codfish Island / Whenua Hou, which is not part of the national park.

== Tramping ==

=== Rakiura Track ===

The popular Rakiura Track is within the national park. The track typically takes three days and two nights to complete, the track is long. The track meanders through lowland kāmahi, tōtara and rimu forest. The track takes in Port William and the north arm of Paterson Inlet. Rakiura kiwi is often seen at night time near the huts.

=== Northwest Circuit ===
The Northwest Circuit circumnavigates the northern and western aspects of Stewart Island. The track is long and takes most people between eight and ten days to complete. Most of the track is along the coastline visiting a series of very isolated sandy beaches. Once it reaches Mason Bay, the track crosses the Freshwater Depression before reaching Paterson Inlet. There are ten huts on the track which are, in general, spaced between five and seven hours walk apart.

=== Southern Circuit ===
The Southern Circuit is a challenging nine-day tramping trip. It is long, and after rain can involve long periods of walking in mud and deep water. The Southern Circuit takes in Doughboy Bay Hut. This eight-bed hut is the southernmost hut in the Department of Conservation&#x27;s network.

<text>Bergedorf () is the largest of the seven boroughs of Hamburg, Germany, named after Bergedorf quarter within this borough. In 2020 the population of the borough was 130,994.

==History==
The city of Bergedorf received town privileges in 1275, then a part of the younger Duchy of Saxony (1180–1296), which was partitioned by its four co-ruling dukes in 1296 into the branch duchies of Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. Bergedorf then became part of the former. This was only to last until 1303, when Lauenburg&#x27;s three co-ruling dukes, Albert III, Eric I, and John II partitioned their branch duchy into three smaller duchies.

Eric then held Bergedorf (Vierlande) and Lauenburg and inherited the share of his childless brother Albert III, Saxe-Ratzeburg, after he was already deceased in 1308 and a retained section from Albert&#x27;s widow Margaret of Brandenburg-Salzwedel on her death. However, his other brother, John II, then claimed a part, so in 1321 Eric conceded Bergedorf (with Vierlande) to him, whose share thus became known thereafter as Saxe-Bergedorf-Mölln while Eric&#x27;s was known as Saxe-Ratzeburg-Lauenburg.

In 1370, John&#x27;s fourth successor Eric III pawned the Herrschaft of Bergedorf, the Vierlande, half the Saxon Wood and Geesthacht to Lübeck in return for a credit of 16,262.5 Lübeck marks. This acquisition included much of the trade route between Hamburg and Lübeck, thus providing a safe passage for freight between the cities. Eric III only retained a life tenancy.

The city of Lübeck and Eric III further stipulated, that upon his death, Lübeck would be entitled to take possession of the pawned areas until his successors repaid the credit and simultaneously exercised the repurchase of Mölln (contracted in 1359), altogether amounting to the then enormous sum of 26,000 Lübeck Marks.

In 1401, Eric III died without issue and was succeeded by his second cousin Eric IV of Saxe-Ratzeburg-Lauenburg. In the same year, Eric IV, supported by his sons Eric (later ruling as Eric V) and John, forcefully captured the pawned areas without making any repayment, before Lübeck could take possession of them. Lübeck acquiesced for the time being.

In 1420, Eric V attacked Prince-Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg and Lübeck allied with Hamburg in support of Brandenburg. Armies of both cities opened a second front and conquered Bergedorf, Riepenburg castle and the Esslingen river toll station (today&#x27;s Zollenspieker Ferry) within weeks. This forced Eric V to agree with Hamburg&#x27;s burgomaster Hein Hoyer and Burgomaster Jordan Pleskow of Lübeck to the Peace of Perleberg on 23 August 1420, which stipulated that all the pawned areas, which Eric IV, Eric V and John IV had violently taken in 1401, were to be irrevocably ceded to the cities of Hamburg and Lübeck.

===Hamburg-Lübeck Condominium===
The cities transformed the acquired areas into the &quot;Beiderstädtischer Besitz&quot; (bi-urban condominium; cooperatively governed possession), ruled by bailiffs in four year terms, alternately staffed by one of the cities. In 1446 the bailiffs&#x27; terms were increased to six years, and in 1620 to life terms. In 1542 bailiff Ditmar Koel introduced the Protestant Reformation in the co-governed municipalities. The area was formally annexed to the First French Empire as part of Bouches de l&#x27;Elbe département between 1811 and 1813. Thereafter, the area was restored to Hamburg and Lübeck, both sovereign states. The first railway in Northern Germany was opened between Hamburg and Bergedorf by the Hamburg-Bergedorf Railway Company in 1842. In the 1860s the Condominium issued its own postage stamps. In 1863 the condominium measured 1039,99 million square Hamburg foot (1 Hamburg foot =286,57 mm), of which 947,34 million sqft were Bergedorf city and the four Vierlande municipalities (Altengamme, Curslack, Kirchwerder and Neuengamme) and 92,65 million sqft of Geesthacht (since 1937 no part of today&#x27;s borough of Bergdorf anymore).

===Hamburg rural seigniory===
Effective of 1 January 1868 Lübeck sold its share in the bi-urban condominium to the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg for 200,000 Prussian thaler. Hamburg integrated the area into its state territory, forming there the &quot;Landherrenschaft Bergedorf&quot; (i.e. Bergedorf rural seigniory) comprising the cities of Bergedorf and Geesthacht and a number of rural municipalities not integrated into the city of Hamburg proper. By the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937 the exclave of Geesthacht was ceded to Schleswig-Holstein.

===Bergedorf Borough of Hamburg===
On 1 April 1938 Bergedorf city and the other municipalities became the &quot;Borough of Bergedorf&quot;, an integrated part of the city of Hamburg. Bergedorf is also known by its nickname &quot;Garden of Hamburg&quot;.

==Geography==
Located in the south-east of the city, the borough of Bergedorf comprises the districts of Allermöhe, Altengamme, Bergedorf, Billwerder, Curslack, Kirchwerder, Lohbrügge, Moorfleet, Neuallermöhe (new district since January 2011), Neuengamme, Ochsenwerder, Reitbrook, Spadenland and Tatenberg.

In 2017 the city of Hamburg started planning the new quarter Oberbillwerder which is located in today&#x27;s Billwerder.

In 2006, according to the statistical office of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, the borough of Bergedorf has a total area of .

Today&#x27;s quarter is the old citBergedorf, located on the river Bille, a right tributary of the Elbe.

==Demographics==
In 2006, 118,942 people were living in Bergedorf borough. The population density was . 19.3% were children under the age of 18, and 18.2% were 65 years of age or older. 9.6% were immigrants. 6,027 people were registered as unemployed. In 1999 there were 51,752 households and 34.6% of all households were made up of individuals.

According to the Department of Motor Vehicles (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt), there were 48,003 private cars registered (406 cars/1000 people) in the borough of Bergedorf.

There were 22 elementary schools, 16 secondary schools, 184 physicians in private practice, and 23 pharmacies in the borough of Bergedorf. These numbers include the Bergedorf quarter.

== Assembly of the borough ==

The &quot;Bezirksversammlung&quot; is elected as representatives of the citizens, simultaneously with elections to the European Parliament. It consists of 45 representatives.

== Postage stamps ==
The Bi-Urban Condominium (see above), or Bergedorf, respectively, its capital and the seat of its postal service &quot;Beiderstädtische Post&quot; (Bi-Urban Mail), founded on 1 April 1847, is of note to philatelists because it issued its own postage stamps between 1861 and 1867. According to the census of March 1863 the Bi-Urban Condominium had a population of 12,468 souls, of which 2,957 lived in Bergedorf city (the rest lived in the other five municipalities of the condominium), making it by far the German territory with the smallest population to issue stamps.

The issue included 5 square stamps with denominations from ½ to 4 schillings. All used the same design - a combined coat of arms of the Free Cities of Lübeck and Hamburg (the two city states which were the sovereign lords over the Bi-Urban Condominium) - but the higher values were larger stamps. All values were printed in black on different coloured papers, except for the 3s stamp, which was printed in blue on pink paper. With Lübeck&#x27;s sale of its share in the condominium to Hamburg in 1867 the territory was integrated into the adjacent city state of Hamburg as the &quot;Rural Seigniory of Bergedorf&quot; and the separate Bi-Urban Mail became part of Hamburg&#x27;s postal service without any more separate stamps. Hamburg, including its Rural Seigniory of Bergedorf began using stamps of the North German Confederation in 1868.

Since the Bi-Urban Condominium had such a small population, relatively few of these stamps were made, and even fewer used; the price of unused stamps is from US$30–$50, while genuinely used stamps go for US$300–$2,000. Reprints, forgeries, and especially faked cancellations are quite common.

<doc id="333549" wikidata="Q264297" url="?curid=333549" title="Jane Dee Hull">
<text>Jane Dee Hull (; August 8, 1935 – April 16, 2020) was an American politician and educator who was the 20th governor of Arizona from 1997 to 2003. She ascended to the office following the resignation of Fife Symington; Hull was elected in her own right in 1998 and served one term. She was the first woman formally elected as Governor of Arizona, and the second woman to serve in the office after Rose Mofford. She was a member of the Republican Party.

A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Hull was a graduate of the University of Kansas with a degree in education. Hull worked as an elementary school teacher while her husband studied to become an obstetrician. She moved to Arizona with her husband, Terry, in 1962 where he began working on the Navajo Nation, while Jane raised the couple&#x27;s four children and taught English. In 1964, the family moved to Phoenix, where she continued to raise her family. A decade later, she started her political career, and became involved with Republican women groups, in addition to volunteering on political campaigns.

In 1978, Hull was elected to her first political office, as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives. During her tenure in office, she would become House Majority Whip and Speaker of the House. In 1994, she was elected to the office of Secretary of State of Arizona, becoming the first Republican to hold the office in more than six decades. After ascending to the office of Governor of Arizona following Fife Symington&#x27;s resignation, Hull was elected Governor in 1998 over former Mayor of Phoenix Paul Johnson, in a landslide election. Hull was constitutionally barred from running for a second full term in 2002, and retired from public service.

==Early life and career==
Hull was born Jane Dee Bowersock in Kansas City, Missouri, the daughter of Mildred (Swenson) and Justin Bowersock, an editor of The Kansas City Star newspaper. Hull graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in education. She taught elementary school in Kansas while her husband was a public health physician there. She moved to Arizona in 1962, first to the Navajo Nation, and later to Phoenix.

After hearing a Barry Goldwater speech, she campaigned for him in the United States presidential election in 1964.

==Legislative career==
Hull entered politics in 1978, being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives as a Republican. She served for seven terms, including two as speaker of the House, the first female speaker in Arizona history. In 1991, while she was speaker, the Arizona legislature experienced a major political scandal called AZSCAM, which resulted in the resignation or removal of ten members of the House and Senate. As a result, Speaker Hull instituted a number of ethics reforms to reestablish public confidence in the legislature.

Politically, &quot;On The Issues&quot;, a non-profit and non-partisan organization which records politicians&#x27; stances on issues, considers Hull to have been a centrist or moderate Republican. Her record is considered to be fiscally conservative and socially moderate.

==Governor of Arizona==
===First term (1997–1999)===

Hull was elected Arizona Secretary of State in 1994. After Governor Fife Symington was forced to resign due to a felony conviction, Hull became governor on September 5, 1997. She was sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, herself a former Arizona legislator. Arizona has no lieutenant governor, so the secretary of state, if holding office by election, stands first in the line of succession.

===1998 gubernatorial campaign===
Hull was elected governor in her own right in 1998. This election was particularly significant because it was the first time in the history of the United States that all five of the top elected executive offices in one state were held by women: Hull; Betsey Bayless, secretary of state; Janet Napolitano, attorney general; Carol Springer, treasurer; and Lisa Graham Keegan, Superintendent of Public Instruction.

===Second term (1999–2003)===
While she was governor, Hull&#x27;s relations with home state U.S. Senator John McCain were strained. During the 2000 Presidential primary season she endorsed his opponent, Texas Governor George W. Bush, in the Arizona primary.

Hull is known for having signed into law the bill that resulted in the &quot;alt-fuels&quot; scandal of 2000. The resulting law promised car buyers up to 60 percent off new vehicles if they were converted to run on alternative fuels like propane or natural gas, yet it did not properly cap the number of buyers eligible for the program nor did it require buyers to use the new fuels. Instead of the $10 million the program was supposed to cost, it ended up costing Arizona $200 million before lawmakers changed the rules.

Hull presided over the execution of Walter LaGrand, over the first ever recommendation of a stay from the Arizona clemency board. 

==Post-governorship==
Hull was constitutionally barred from running for a second full term in 2002 (the Arizona constitution limits the Governor to two consecutive terms, or parts of terms, even when ascending to the office in the middle of a term), and she was succeeded by Janet Napolitano, who defeated Matt Salmon. After leaving office, Hull spent three months in New York City, as a public delegate from the United States to the United Nations General Assembly (2004).

After the death of Rose Mofford on September 15, 2016, Hull became the oldest living Governor of Arizona, in addition to being the oldest living Secretary of State of Arizona. An elementary school is named for Hull in Chandler.

==Personal life==
Hull married Terry Hull, an obstetrician in 1954. They had four children. Hull died on April 16, 2020, at age 84; her husband had died earlier on the same day.

==Electoral history==


==Legacy==
Former Arizona governor Janet Napolitano characterized her as &quot;a straight shooter&quot;, and then governor Doug Ducey credited her with &quot;providing steady leadership and unwavering commitment to do what&#x27;s right and ethical&quot;

<text>Yiannis Chryssomallis (; born November 14, 1954), known professionally as Yanni ( ), is a Greek composer, keyboardist, pianist, and music producer.

Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, &quot;Live at the Acropolis,&quot; yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni&#x27;s concerts have included India&#x27;s Taj Mahal, China&#x27;s Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates&#x27; Burj Khalifa, Russia&#x27;s Kremlin, Puerto Rico&#x27;s El Morro castle, Lebanon&#x27;s ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia&#x27;s Roman Theatre of Carthage, India&#x27;s Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel.

At least sixteen of Yanni&#x27;s albums have peaked at No. 1 in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top New Age Album&quot; category, and two albums (&quot;Dare to Dream&quot; and &quot;In My Time&quot;) received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni&#x27;s compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial.

Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a &quot;true global artist&quot; and his music is said to reflect his &quot;one world, one people&quot; philosophy.

==Early life==
Yanni was born November 14, 1954, in Kalamata, Greece, the son of a banker, Sotiri Chryssomallis, and a homemaker, Felitsa (short for Triandafelitsa, which means &quot;rose&quot;). He displayed musical talent at a young age, playing the piano at the age of 6. His parents encouraged him to learn at his own pace and in his own way, without formal music training. The self-taught musician continues to use the &quot;musical shorthand&quot; that he developed as a child, rather than employ traditional musical notation.

Yanni set a Greek national record in the 50-meter freestyle swimming competition at age 14.

In November 1972, Yanni moved from Greece to the United States to attend the University of Minnesota beginning in January 1973, majoring in psychology. For a time he earned money by washing dishes at the student union. Yanni later explained that learning English forced him to read each paragraph several times in what he called a slow and frustrating process, but which helped him memorize the material and do well on tests. He received a B.A. degree in psychology in 1976.

During his time as a student, Yanni played in a local rock band and continued to study piano and other keyboard instruments. Upon graduating, when he dedicated himself exclusively to music for one full year and found he was the happiest he had ever been, he said he decided music would be his life&#x27;s work.

==Music career==
In 1977, Yanni joined the Minneapolis-based rock group Chameleon, performing with its founder, drummer Charlie Adams, with whom he would work into the 2010s. While in Minneapolis, Yanni also worked with choreographer Loyce Houlton to provide music for dance works produced by the Minnesota Dance Theatre. After touring with Chameleon from 1980 to 1984, Yanni moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of movie soundtrack work.

===1980s to early 1990s: Emergence and recognition===
In 1980, Yanni recorded and produced his first album &quot;Optimystique,&quot; which Atlantic Records re-released in 1984 and Private Music re-released in 1989.

Yanni formed a band in 1987 and began to tour in 1988 with an ensemble including pianist/singer John Tesh and drummer Charlie Adams, promoting his early albums &quot;Keys to Imagination,&quot; &quot;Out of Silence,&quot; and &quot;Chameleon Days&quot;. A highlight of the tour was a performance with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra that elicited a positive review, considered seminal to Yanni&#x27;s public recognition, from a &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; critic. Yanni&#x27;s emergence was said to be &quot;timed perfectly&quot; with the growing popularity of contemporary instrumental music. In this time frame, Yanni wrote motion picture soundtracks for &quot;Steal the Sky&quot; (1988), &quot;Heart of Midnight&quot; (1988), &quot;I Love You Perfect&quot; (1989), &quot;She&#x27;ll Take Romance&quot; (1990), &quot;When You Remember Me&quot; (1990), &quot;Children of the Bride&quot; (1990), and &quot;Hua qi Shao Lin&quot; (1994).
Yanni gained visibility as the result of his November 1990 appearances in &quot;People&quot; magazine and on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; with actress Linda Evans, with whom he had been in a relationship since 1989. However, high-visibility appearances on public television, best-selling records and videos, and overflow concerts earned him recognition beyond his relationship with Evans.

&quot;Dare to Dream,&quot; released in 1992, was Yanni&#x27;s first Grammy-nominated album. It included &quot;Aria,&quot; a song based on Léo Delibes&#x27; The Flower Duet (&quot;Lakmé,&quot; 1883) and popularized by an award-winning British Airways commercial. A second Grammy-nominated album, &quot;In My Time,&quot; followed in 1993.

===1990s: &quot;Acropolis,&quot; world concerts, exhaustion and renewal===

Yanni&#x27;s breakthrough concert, &quot;Live at the Acropolis,&quot; was filmed in September 1993 at the 2,000-year-old Herodes Atticus Theater at the Acropolis of Athens, an album, VHS and Laserdisc being released in 1994. &quot;Acropolis&quot; was Yanni&#x27;s first live album, and used his core band with a full sixty piece orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra which was arranged and conducted by Iranian-American musician Shahrdad Rohani.

Without financial backing, Yanni risked $2 million of his personal fortune in the &quot;Acropolis&quot; production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. The resulting video was broadcast on PBS and became one of its most popular programs ever, seen in 65 countries by half a billion people. It became the second best-selling music concert video of all time (after &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller&quot;), selling more than 7 million copies worldwide.

In March 1997, Yanni became one of the few Western artists permitted to perform and record at the Taj Mahal in India. Yanni followed in May 1997 with performances at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, becoming the first Western artist in modern times permitted to perform at the historic site. Live broadcasts of the two concerts were seen by 100 million television viewers throughout the world. The two events formed the live album and video, &quot;Tribute,&quot; released in November 1997.

After negotiating the demands of gaining permission to perform at the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City in 1997, breaking up with Linda Evans in early 1998, and completing a long world tour later in 1998, Yanni halted his music career. Yanni later related that he had become depressed, and returned to Greece to live with his parents for three months before traveling the world. He didn&#x27;t do an interview for two years, later explaining, &quot;I traveled. I wanted to see other people&#x27;s ideas of life, get out of the American dream.&quot;

===2000s to 2010: After a hiatus, new perspectives===
In 2000, after the two-year hiatus, Yanni released &quot;If I Could Tell You,&quot; his first studio album in seven years. The album sold 55,000 copies in its first week and landed at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, his highest debut to date. Yanni described the album as more of an even-tempered &quot;listening&quot; album, less dramatic than the live concert albums &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; or &quot;Tribute.&quot; He explained that he himself created all the album&#x27;s sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio.

The music in Yanni&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Ethnicity&quot; represented many of the world&#x27;s cultures, Yanni saying it uses to reflect the color and beauty of a multicultural society. The album was released near the publication date of Yanni&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Yanni in Words.&quot; On October 23, 2003, Yanni performed a keyboard instrumental version of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before Game 5 of the 2003 World Series.

For the first time in his career, Yanni brought vocalists to the forefront in the Ric Wake collaboration &quot;Yanni Voices,&quot; the artist&#x27;s first studio album in six years. PBS broadcast video of a November 2008 &quot;Voices&quot; Acapulco concert weeks before the album&#x27;s March 24, 2009 release by Walt Disney Records&#x27; Disney Pearl Imprint, the album release preceding a tour produced by Pearl&#x27;s Buena Vista Concerts division.

The album &quot;Mexicanisimo,&quot; released in November of Mexico&#x27;s bicentennial year 2010, was a tribute to that country through Yanni&#x27;s collaborative interpretation of its folk music. It involved collaboration with singer-songwriter Pepe Aguilar and singer-actress Lucero.

===2010s: New sound designs, and a return to world tours===

The &quot;Truth of Touch&quot; album was released in February 2011, Yanni&#x27;s first studio album of new material since &quot;Ethnicity&quot; eight years earlier. &quot;Truth of Touch&#x27;s&quot; varied content reflected contemporary instrumental, electronic, and cinematic influences, and crossed over into popular, new age, and world music. Though Yanni said that &quot;Truth of Touch&quot; was started by experimenting with new sound designs, Allmusic&#x27;s James Christopher Monger said that the album shows Yanni returning to his instrumental roots, and should appeal to fans of his music from the mid-1990s. Three of fifteen tracks on the predominantly instrumental album included vocals from respective &quot;Yanni Voices&quot; vocalists.

In April 2012, Yanni released the &quot;Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico&quot; live album CD and DVD which were recorded and filmed at two outdoor concerts on December 16 and 17, 2011 on the grounds of the Castillo (Fort) San Felipe del Morro (&quot;El Morro&quot;), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The recorded concerts were broadcast on PBS beginning in March 2012, the production constituting Yanni&#x27;s tenth collaboration with that organization.

Yanni performed again in China in the February 9, 2013, CCTV Spring Festival Gala (annual audience 700 million) with Chinese zither artist Chang Jing in what was the first year that CCTV had invited foreign artists to perform. For the performance, Yanni released a single &quot;East Meets West&quot; which was a mashup of his several famous songs (Santorini, North Shore of Matsushima) together with a solo part performed on Chinese zither.

Yanni&#x27;s 2010s tours included new vocalists, distinct from the 2008–2009 &quot;Yanni Voices&quot; vocalists, though the setlists remained predominantly instrumental.

In March 2014, Yanni released his seventeenth studio album, &quot;Inspirato,&quot; a collaboration with operatic tenor Plácido Domingo and producer Ric Wake that, like &quot;Yanni Voices&quot; five years earlier, highlighted vocal performances. In &quot;Inspirato,&quot; distinguished operatic vocalists performed remakes of songs that Yanni had previously released over his career, the songs&#x27; titles and lyrics being predominantly in the Italian language.

On October 30 and 31, 2015, Yanni performed two concerts on the grounds of the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, his first performance in Egypt. The concerts included fireworks and a video broadcast from International Space Station commander Scott Kelly, and were recorded in 4K HD for subsequent broadcast on PBS. To convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011–14), an Egyptian security force of 3,000 people secured the concert area.

In December 2015, Yanni produced a song, &quot;Seven Billion Dreams,&quot; for a NASA video that marked the 15th anniversary of the International Space Station.

On December 18, 2015, Yanni released the single &quot;Desert Soul&quot; from his eighteenth studio album, &quot;Sensuous Chill,&quot; which was released on January 29, 2016. The album, which, being built around synthesizers, programmed rhythms and electronic sounds, was said to &quot;come full circle&quot; to his early-1980s albums.

Yanni&#x27;s single, &quot;When Dreams Come True&quot;, called a &quot;minimal piano-led&quot; piece, was composed incrementally throughout a 60-date North American tour as a series of improvisations performed during successive shows. Its first complete live performance was in February 2019 at the Winter at Tantora Festival in Al-&#x27;Ula, Saudi Arabia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Yanni&#x27;s August 2019 single honoring his daughter Krystalán is called &quot;Ladyhawk&quot;, alluding to how she watches over him like a guardian angel.

In November 2019, Yanni released single &quot;Blue&quot;, taking inspiration from the ocean.

In the 2010s, Yanni&#x27;s international tours included performances in over thirty countries on five continents, including (alphabetically) Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States (including Puerto Rico), and Uzbekistan.

===2020s===
In August 2020, Yanni released his nineteenth studio album &quot;In His Purest Form,&quot; containing solo piano performances of his previously released songs, and his first piano solo album since &quot;In My Time&quot; (1993).

In late 2021, Yanni began to offer non-fungible tokens.

==Influences, music and concerts==
===Musical Influences===
From childhood, Yanni accepted a wide variety of musical styles, listening to radio stations from Northern Africa, Arab countries, and Europe. He observed that &quot;there were no &quot;rock&quot; stations or &quot;classical&quot; stations—each station would just play everything.&quot; Yanni&#x27;s music is said to reflect his encounters with cultures around the world and embody his philosophy of &quot;one world, one people.&quot; In this vein, &quot;Booth Newspapers&#x27; &quot; Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk perceived the eclectic inspirations of Yanni&#x27;s music to be an element of his success: Yanni&#x27;s &quot;Middle Eastern and Oriental scales and mixed meters sound just exotic enough to entice his middle-of-the-road fans, but not so authentic as to mystify folks who grew up with a backbeat, so you can&#x27;t lose it,&quot; adding that certain songs &quot;leave you with a sense that you&#x27;ve just heard a bit of a steel drum or a Greek bouzouki or a Japanese koto or possibly all three.&quot;
Yanni&#x27;s musical influences include music from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as classical, rock and roll, and electronic music. Yanni explained that the 1970s, with its new technology and electronic instruments, were particularly influential at that stage in his career, and that even recently his &quot;Truth of Touch&quot; album (2011) was started by experimenting with new sound designs. Having been exposed to classical music very early in life—listening to Bach at age 8—he counts several classical pianists and composers among his influences, citing Beethoven as a favorite and Chopin as &quot;No. 2 favorite.&quot; Yanni mentioned being influenced not only by classical composers like Mozart and Bach, but also rock and roll bands such as Led Zeppelin, the People!, and Black Sabbath.

Yanni explained that &quot;the most influence I&#x27;ve ever had from music was doing (soundtracks for) movies... mostly instrumental music,&quot; mentioning his love for the work of Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams. &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; Kelly Jasper noted that most of Yanni&#x27;s music is instrumental, indicating that Yanni surmised that the lack of lyrics is what allowed his music to become popular internationally. Yanni went on to say, &quot;There are no lyrics in my music for the most part, so the whole message is transmitted through the rhythm, melody, and sounds, and I think that has to do with crossing all the borders and being able to go to different countries.&quot; &quot;It is very difficult, if not impossible, to lie with instrumental music because it deals in emotions only.&quot; He has also said that words operate in a different area of the brain, and lyrics &quot;tend to put a song into a box.&quot;

However, Yanni performed with four vocalists in the forefront in &quot;Yanni Voices&quot; (2008–2009), and performed with vocalists on tours and in the &quot;Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico&quot; concerts (December 2011) and CD/DVD (2012). In late 2011 Yanni remarked that he tends to prefer instrumental music &quot;because it&#x27;s more open, but the human voice too can be the most expressive instrument known to man. There is power to it.&quot; Referring to his creative experiences on the 2009 &quot;Voices&quot; project, Yanni explained that &quot;while most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument.&quot;

===Music genres distinguished from the &quot;new age&quot; spiritual movement===

While Yanni has said that new age is &quot;a spiritual definition more than a musical definition,&quot; his music is said to be &quot;adopted by&quot; the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called &quot;contemporary instrumental&quot; and has been described as &quot;an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock.&quot; However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as &quot;Greek&quot; and &quot;new age,&quot; emphasizing that &quot;when someone says new age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you&#x27;re vacuuming the house. I don&#x27;t want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested.&quot; Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: &quot;&quot;New age&quot; implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic.&quot;

In 2012, Yanni remarked that he has never liked putting art into categories or assigning labels, adding that he always composed music &quot;to honestly reflect the lessons learned and the experiences I have shared throughout my life.&quot; For example, Yanni&#x27;s university study of psychology influenced his music: &quot;When I create music, it is a reflection of my soul, my experiences in life and my relationships with other people and cultures. Psychology, and understanding who we are as people in this world, is present in almost every creative thought I have.&quot;

===Unconventional career track===
The genre of Yanni&#x27;s music made it unsuitable for most commercial radio or for music television. In 2012 Yanni expressed the importance of PBS to his career, saying that the network &quot;always allowed me to present my music without any censorship or influence, and encouraged me to be the artist that I am,&quot; and had been &quot;a great part of my career for over 20 years.&quot;

Yanni took an unconventional path to recognition, for example, by risking his personal fortune to fund historic-monument events such as his 1993 Acropolis concerts, by producing specials on public television, by creating alone in his home-built studio, and by performing many of his own production duties—thus by-passing the conventional music industry. In 2000, &quot;The Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; David Segal wrote that Yanni was &quot;a living metaphor for &#x27;success on your own terms,&#x27; the dream of every American with an idea that is either ridiculed or ignored.&quot;

===Music===
In an early-career review in the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; in the late 1980s, Yanni&#x27;s concert with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was described as &quot;exhilarating, moving and inspiring.&quot; In 1995, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&#x27; &quot; Don Heckman wrote that Yanni&#x27;s music is &quot;based on sweeping romantic melodies underscored with energetic Mediterranean rhythms.&quot; More analytically, the &quot;Hartford Courant&#x27;s&quot; Steve Metcalf &quot;deconstructed&quot; Yanni&#x27;s music as being &quot;from a harmonic standpoint, constructed of materials found in a lot of late-19th, early 20th century classical music. It is essentially tonal, tinged with mild whiffs of dissonance here and there, sometimes rhythmically frisky, graspable on first listening, and self-evidently mood-inducing. There are two basic moods to Yanni music: struttingly heroic with martial overtones, and dreamily contemplative... A kind of peaceful, easy-feeling link between pop music and classical music.&quot;

More recently, Allmusic&#x27;s Mark Deming characterized Yanni&#x27;s compositions and performances as having &quot;a pronounced sense of drama, dynamics, and romanticism,&quot; writing that Yanni has a &quot;commanding performance style.&quot; Rob Garratt wrote in &quot;The National&quot; that Yanni &quot;breaks all the rules&quot; in producing music &quot;typically in two modes – poundingly heroic or reflectively ambient.&quot; In 2012 Howie Grapek remarked in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&#x27;s&quot; &quot;PBPulse&quot; that &quot;there are few modern-day composers with a unique sense of music and style which is truly their own. To compare new-age music with classic rock is a stretch, but for Yanni, it is possible. This Greek composer marries contemporary new-age spirituality with today&#x27;s pop attitudes and delivers a unique sound.&quot; Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra.

Having been called a &quot;true global artist,&quot; Yanni has employed musicians of various nationalities, and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments from around the world from an Australian didgeridoo to a Peruvian charango, to perform with his classical orchestra, rock rhythm section, and electronic keyboards. His music is described as &quot;an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds, from Native American chants to African rhythms and Asian harmonies.&quot; Before his 2015 concerts at the Egyptian Pyramids Yanni said that emotions are the same throughout the world, and that his predominantly instrumental music can communicate those emotions with people everywhere because it bypasses language.

&quot;The Morning Call&#x27;s&quot; John L. Moser wrote that &quot;trends come and trends go,&quot; but that Yanni&#x27;s music &quot;seems to defy trends and... feels like it&#x27;s music for all time.&quot; Moser interviewed the composer, asking if he intentionally tries to create &quot;something that&#x27;s going to last forever as opposed to something that&#x27;s just going to sell 1 million copies right away,&quot; Yanni replied that &quot;There&#x27;s no way you can create art to last forever... so you can&#x27;t have that in your mind.&quot; Instead, describing his creative process, Yanni explained that his knowledge of music and instruments and his experience in different cultures is a &quot;primordial soup that comes together and it shows itself and it appears. And it&#x27;s fluid. It&#x27;s effortless.&quot;

Yanni&#x27;s popularity with the public and his success on public television have contrasted sharply with views of some critics. The more extreme criticisms include statements that Yanni&#x27;s music is &quot;aural wallpaper... lacking in substance&quot; or characterizing Yanni as a &quot;no-talent poseur&quot; whose music has little intellectual weight, while his fans&#x27; opinions have been paraphrased as calling Yanni a &quot;highly original artist whose profound spirituality has created a unique kind of music.&quot; In this regard, one commentator wrote in 2019 that Yanni&#x27;s songs are &quot;hazy and undefinable&quot; and &quot;unstructured in the traditional way&quot;, paraphrasing Yanni&#x27;s statement that listeners&#x27; responses depend on the degree to which they &quot;invest themselves in the music&quot;, which has a &quot;relentless focus on feeling rather than hooks&quot;.

Yanni claims to have had perfect pitch since childhood. He continues to use the &quot;musical shorthand&quot; that he developed as a child rather than employ traditional musical notation, and hires someone to perform what he calls the &quot;tedious process&quot; of making conventional written charts for orchestra members. Even so, since music is an auditory domain, Yanni must train the musicians in what cannot be conveyed in that writing.

===Concerts and live streaming===
&quot;The Palm Beach Post&#x27;s&quot; Howie Grapek remarked about an April 2012 performance that the show was not a one-man keyboard show, but spotlighted individual long solos showcasing the band members&#x27; talents, and that Yanni &quot;loves giving them the opportunity to shine individually.&quot; &quot;Booth Newspapers&#x27; &quot; Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk commented that Yanni &quot;has great sidemen – always has.&quot; Further, Yanni expands sound variety by using multiple interchangeable keyboards that are interconnected so that playing one keyboard can cause other keyboards to play corresponding notes emulating different instruments.

Yanni&#x27;s concerts, known for their lighting and other technical aspects, require over 2,000 timing cues for a show&#x27;s lighting. Yanni&#x27;s longtime lighting designer remarked in 2013 that the lighting is critically timed to Yanni&#x27;s music itself, accommodating its variety of time signatures, further observing that since Yanni plays mostly theatrical venues rather than arenas, the lighting can include subtle moves and color. The lighting also emphasizes band members&#x27; solos, as well as specific moments in the concerts.

Commenting on Yanni&#x27;s &quot;great lighting&quot; on the stage and &quot;plenty of reverb in the audience,&quot; &quot;Booth Newspapers&#x27; &quot; Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk remarked that a Yanni concert &quot;can be an intoxicating experience.&quot;

In early 2017 Yanni began his &quot;An Evening in Conversation with Yanni&quot; or &quot;An intimate Conversation with Yanni&quot; tour in which audience questions and on-stage participation guided the show, and Yanni played a piano without a band. In May–June 2019, Yanni performed a multi-night residency at New York’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, two videos for which topped &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Facebook Live Videos chart before other Yanni videos topped the same chart in October December 2019, and February 2020.

==Honors, awards and distinctions==
In addition to performing at venues such as Royal Albert Hall (London; 1995 &amp; 2014), Yanni has performed at such world landmarks as the Acropolis of Athens (Greece; 1993), the Taj Mahal (Agra, India; 1997), the Forbidden City (Beijing, China; 1997), the Burj Khalifa (the world&#x27;s tallest building; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 2011), the Kremlin (Moscow, Russia; 2011), the Castillo San Felipe del Morro (&quot;El Morro&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, U.S. territory; 2011), the ancient city of Byblos (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lebanon; 2013), the Roman Theatre of Carthage (Tunis, Tunisia; 2014), Laxmi Vilas Palace (Vadodara, India; 2015), the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza (Egypt, 2015), the Amman Citadel (Jordan, 2016), the Prambanan Temple (Indonesia, 2019) and Al-&#x27;Ula (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Saudi Arabia; 2019).

Rising in popularity with the new age music boom of the 1980s and 1990s, Yanni&#x27;s music became more well known through adult alternative radio airplay, appearances on public television and in television commercials, as well as international music tours. Yanni&#x27;s music has been used in television shows and televised sporting events, including the British Open (golf), the U.S. Open (golf), the Super Bowl, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, U.S. Open tennis championships, the Tour de France, the World Figure Skating Championships, and the Olympic Games. He also composed music for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Now.&quot;
Yanni&#x27;s &quot;Acroyali/Standing in Motion&quot; was determined to have the &quot;Mozart effect&quot; by the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&quot; (April 2001) because the composition is similar to Mozart&#x27;s K 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability, characteristics thought to decrease seizure activity and to enhance spatial-temporal performance.

During Yanni&#x27;s October 2011 tour of China, Yanni became the first Western artist to be invited to adopt a giant panda (bear) cub at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a &quot;privilege... usually reserved for countries rather than personalities.&quot; &quot;Officials from the research base invited the musician to adopt the animal, saying their decision was made from the inspiration and harmony that derives from his music.&quot; Yanni named the panda &quot;Santorini,&quot; also the name of a Greek island, explaining that the Greek word &quot;irini&quot; means &#x27;peace&#x27;.&quot;

In February 2013, Yanni and Celine Dion were the first non-Chinese artists invited to perform (separately) in China at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a CCTV televised event with an annual audience of 700 million.

&quot;Billboard&quot; named Yanni their No. 5 &quot;new age album artist of 2016&quot;. He was named to the same list in 2014 (No. 6), 2012 (ranked No. 5), 2011 (No. 1), 2010 (No. 4), 2009 (No. 3), 2007 (No. 4), and 2006 (No. 4).

Yanni&#x27;s albums &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; (1992) and &quot;In My Time&quot; (1993) received Grammy Award nominations for Best New Age Album.&quot;

The PBS specials &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; and &quot;Tribute&quot; received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, Movie or Special, in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Lee Rose and David &quot;Gurn&quot; Kaniski Lighting Designers.

At least sixteen Yanni albums peaked at No. 1 in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top New Age Album&quot; category, more than anyone except Jim Brickman and Mannheim Steamroller.

In addition to earning a B.A. in psychology in 1976 from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Yanni received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the same institution on May 6, 2004.

==Charitable and humanitarian activities==
Yanni has had a collaborative relationship with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in its fundraising efforts since the early years of his career, reportedly raising more than $13 million for that organization. The &quot;Yanni Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico&quot; production (2012) was Yanni&#x27;s tenth collaboration with PBS.

Yanni has assisted the conservation efforts of the World Wide Fund for Nature (the World Wildlife Fund, WWF), sponsoring a symbolic &quot;Panda Adoption Kit&quot; program in which he guaranteed $50,000 in donations. Yanni has also been a spokesman for NASA.

Yanni has performed concerts in troubled areas of the world, such as in Tunisia one week after the July 17, 2014, terrorist attack that killed 14, and in Egypt to convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011–14) but between whose two Great Pyramids concerts occurred the October 31, 2015, terrorist downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 in the Sinai Peninsula.

==Autobiography==
Yanni&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Yanni in Words,&quot; co-authored by David Rensin, was published in February 2003, coinciding with the release of his &quot;Ethnicity&quot; album. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller in the nonfiction category on March 2, 2003.

<text>Orazio Vecchi (6 December 1550 (baptized) in Modena – 19 February 1605) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance. He is most famous for his madrigal comedies, particularly &quot;L&#x27;Amfiparnaso&quot;.

== Life ==

He was born in Modena, and studied with Salvatore Essenga, a Servite friar there. In addition he prepared for holy orders with early education at the Benedictine monastery, and took holy orders sometime before 1577.

By the end of the 1570s he was well-connected with the composers of the Venetian school (for example Claudio Merulo and Giovanni Gabrieli) since he collaborated with them in writing a sestina for a ducal marriage. During this period he accompanied Count Baldassare Rangoni on his travels, going to Bergamo and Brescia.

He was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; (director of music) at the Salò cathedral between 1581 and 1584. Following this, he was the choirmaster at the cathedral of Reggio Emilia, until 1586. In that year he moved to Correggio where he was appointed canon of the cathedral there; he composed copiously during his time there, though he felt isolated from the major musical centers of Italy such as Rome, Venice, Florence and Ferrara. Eventually he attempted to correct this by moving back to Modena, where he attained the rank of &quot;mansionario&quot; (a priest who also had charge of the choir). He seems to have had considerable financial difficulties during this time, which he alluded to in his letters, and occasionally in his compositions.
In 1594 his madrigal comedy, &quot;L&#x27;Amfiparnaso&quot;, premiered in Modena and was published in 1597 in a lavishly illustrated edition. That same year he visited Venice, where he published a collection of canzonette. In addition he published a huge amount of other music that same year, evidently his complete production of the last 16 years in Correggio and the other towns. One of the pieces he published was L&#x27;Amfiparnaso, which is his best-known composition.

Duke Cesare d&#x27;Este hired Vecchi in 1598 to be his &quot;maestro di corte&quot;, i.e. the master of music at his court, and Vecchi accompanied him to Rome and Florence in 1600; while in Florence he heard Jacopo Peri&#x27;s opera &quot;Euridice&quot;. Afterwards he returned to Modena where he continued to serve in the cathedral until his death in 1605.

== Music and influence ==

Vecchi was renowned for his madrigals, especially his grouping of them together in a new form called the &quot;madrigal comedy.&quot; This was a light, popular, and dramatic entertainment form of the late 16th century, sometimes regarded as one of the precursors to opera.

In addition, Vecchi published books of canzonette, a lighter alternative to the madrigal, midway in complexity and seriousness between it and the villanella. He also composed serious madrigals, though not in the quantity of composers like Marenzio, as well as some sacred music. The sacred music in particular shows the influence of the Venetian school, with polychoral writing as well as contrasting duple- versus triple-time sections.

<doc id="333583" wikidata="Q1323681" url="?curid=333583" title="Snot (band)">
<text>Snot is an American nu metal band from Santa Barbara, California. Formed in 1995, the band released their only studio album &quot;Get Some&quot; with founding vocalist Lynn Strait in 1997 and disbanded after his death in 1998. In 2008, the lineup of lead guitarist Mikey Doling, bassist John Fahnestock, drummer Jamie Miller and rhythm guitarist Sonny Mayo reunited. In 2009, a new band, Tons, was formed, with Brandon Espinosa as vocalist. In February 2014, Snot had at the time reformed again. But during 2015, the band stopped activity. Though in 2024, the band was reformed yet again.

== History ==
=== Formation, &quot;Get Some&quot; and death of Lynn Strait (1995–1998) ===
The band was formed by singer Lynn Strait, the former bassist of a local punk band, Lethal Dose, and lead guitarist Mikey Doling, formerly of Kronix. After building a strong following with performances in Los Angeles, Snot signed with Geffen Records, and began work on their debut album with producer T-Ray. The album, titled &quot;Get Some&quot;, was released on May 13, 1997.

The band performed on the 1998 Ozzfest tour. On July 9, 1998, Strait was arrested in Mansfield, Massachusetts, after emerging nude from the oversized toilet prop used by Limp Bizkit in their performances. The band began work on their second album. On December 11, 1998, Strait died in a car accident when a truck struck his car, killing him and his dog, Dobbs. The band disbanded following Strait&#x27;s death, with Doling stating, &quot;We can&#x27;t go on without Lynn. It&#x27;s just bullshit when bands do that.&quot;

===Post-accident (1999–2007)===
Because Strait had not recorded vocals for the album, it was decided that the album&#x27;s vocal tracks would be completed by friends of Strait as a tribute. &quot;Strait Up&quot;, released on November 7, 2000, featured appearances by the lead vocalists of System of a Down, Korn, Hed PE, Soulfly, Incubus, Sevendust, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber, Slipknot and Sugar Ray, among others. However Doling told the Life is Peachy podcast in 2021, that the instrumental tracks written for the sophomore Snot album did not form the basis for Strait Up and he wrote new music for Strait Up, with each vocalists individual style in mind. It peaked at number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

A live album, &quot;Alive!&quot;, was released on July 30, 2002. It peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart. On April 5, 2007, the band reunited for a performance in Anaheim, California, with vocals performed by Invitro singer Jeff Weber.

===First reunion, Tons and breakup (2008–2011)===
In 2008, the band reformed, with former Divine Heresy singer Tommy Vext on vocals. Vext and Sonny Mayo left the band, and a new band, &quot;Tons&quot;, was formed in 2009 with a new vocalist, Brandon Espinoza, formerly of Spineshank and minus knives. They recorded three new songs titled &quot;Ability &amp; Control&quot;, &quot;1000 Ways of Pain&quot; and &quot;Fan the Flames&quot; before members of the group moved on to new projects.

===Second reunion (2014–present)===
On February 11, 2014, Snot reunited again at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood. This second reunion lineup once again features Vext, Mayo, Doling, Fahnestock and Miller. They went on to play three more shows in the Southern California area before once again going quiet, although they poked at the possibility of another future U.S. tour. In August it was announced that Snot would be hitting the road once again, starting November 28 and going through December 22 all throughout the U.S. An international tour is coming in January/February. However, in October, vocalist Tommy Vext announced he had left the band to form his new band, Westfield Massacre, and that Snot already had a replacement vocalist (Carl Bensley) in place. For the European dates, Mike Smith would fill in for Sonny Mayo, who was going to be unable to tour due to business commitments.

On 29 September 2024, after ten years of relative inactivity, Dolling teased the return of Snot. The return was officially announced in November, with Mayo returning and a then unknown singer. The singer was announced to not be either Vext or Bensley. Andy Knapp was formally introduced as the new singer, with his first show with the band on 17 January 2025.

Snot has been described as nu metal, hardcore punk, funk metal, and alternative metal.

<text>Lucius Licinius Lucullus was a Roman politician who became consul in 151 BC.

Lucullus was sent to Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain, on the east coast of Hispania) when the senate rejected a proposal for a peace treaty with the Celtiberians by Marcus Claudius Marcellus to end the Numantine War (154–152 BC). However, Marcellus went ahead with his plan and quickly concluded a treaty before Lucullus got there. Lucullus was disappointed and, &quot;being greedy of fame and needing money because he was in straitened circumstances&quot;, he attacked the Vaccaei, a Celtiberian tribe which lived further north and who were not at war with Rome, and did so without the authorisation of the senate. He claimed that they had mistreated the Carpetani as an excuse.

He pitched camp by the town of Cauca (near modern Segovia) and when its people asked for peace terms he demanded, among other things, that a garrison be placed in the town. He got his soldiers to kill all the adult males. Only a few out of 20,000 escaped. Lucullus then went the city of Intercatia (Villanueva del Campo, in the modern province of Zamora) whose inhabitants, having heard about Cauca, refused to ask for terms. He struggled to seize the city, and his lieutenant, Scipio Africanus the Younger, promised the Intercatians that if they made a treaty it would not be broken. They trusted him and surrendered. Lucullus was advised not to attack the large city of Pallantia (modern Palencia), which hosted many refugees and was renowned for its bravery, but because he heard that it was a rich city he camped there. The Pallantian cavalry constantly harassed his foragers until he ran out of food and he had to withdraw. He set up winter camp in the land of the Turdetani (in modern Andalusia).

He was imprisoned by the tribunes for attempting to enforce a troop levy too harshly.

Appian emphasised the greed of Lucullus and said that he fought these campaigns for the sake of gold and silver, which he thought were abundant all over Hispania. However, the people he attacked did not have any and did not even &quot;set any value on those metals&quot;. He added that Lucullus was never called into account for his actions.

While he was in Turdetania, the Lusitanians, who were also rebelling, carried out raids in the area. Lucullus invaded Lusitania and, according to Appian, he depopulated it. He was not meant to get involved. The war with the Lusitanians was under the jurisdiction of Servius Sulpicius Galba, the praetor of Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain, roughly modern Andalusia) and Lucullus was wintering in his province. However, Appian wrote that Galba was even more greedy than Lucullus. He let him do so and did the same on the other side of Lusitania. Galba, too, was in search for booty, and slaughtered a large number of Lusitanians by treachery. He, too, was not held to account.

Lucullus built a temple dedicated to Fortuna in the Velabrum to celebrate his &quot;success&quot;. He adorned it with statues which Lucius Mummius Achaicus, who defeated the Achaean League in Greece, had lent him. Later Mummius asked for his statues back, but Lucullus told him that it would be irresponsible because they were now dedicated to the goddess. Cassius Dio wrote that Mummius lent him his statues because of his amiable and charitable nature.

==Children==

Lucullus was the father of the Lucius Licinius Lucullus who was praetor in 104 BC and led Roman forces against rebel Sicilian slaves in the Second Servile War (104–100 BC). He was the grandfather of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was consul in 74 BC, and the Roman commander in the first part of the Third Mithridatic War (74-63 BC) until 67 BC, and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, who was consul in 73 BC and proconsul of Macedonia in 72 BC.

<text>Lucius Licinius Lucullus (; 118–57/56 BC) was a Roman general and statesman, closely connected with Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In culmination of over 20 years of almost continuous military and government service, he conquered the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship in diverse situations, most famously during the Siege of Cyzicus in 73–72 BC, and at the Battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene in 69 BC. His command style received unusually favourable attention from ancient military experts, and his campaigns appear to have been studied as examples of skillful generalship.

Lucullus returned to Rome from the east with so much captured booty that the vast sums of treasure, jewels, priceless works of art, and slaves could not be fully accounted for. On his return Lucullus poured enormous sums into private building projects, husbandry and even aquaculture projects, which shocked and amazed his contemporaries by their magnitude. He also patronised the arts and sciences lavishly, transforming his hereditary estate in the highlands of Tusculum into a hotel-and-library complex for scholars and philosophers. He built the famous &quot;horti Lucullani&quot; (Palace and gardens of Lucullus) on the Pincian Hill in Rome, and became a cultural innovator in the deployment of imperial wealth. His achievements led Pliny the Elder to refer to him as &quot;Xerxes in a Toga&quot;. He died during the winter of 57–56 BC and was buried at the family estate near Tusculum.

The conquest &quot;agnomen&quot; of &quot;Ponticus&quot; is sometimes incorrectly appended to his name in modern texts. In ancient sources it is attributed only to his consular colleague Marcus Aurelius Cotta after the latter’s capture and brutal destruction of Heraclea Pontica during the Third Mithridatic War.

==Contemporary sources==
Lucullus was included in the biographical collections of Roman leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by his contemporary Marcus Terentius Varro. Two biographies of Lucullus survive today, Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lucullus&quot; in the famous series of &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, in which Lucullus is paired with the Athenian aristocratic politician and &quot;Strategos&quot; Cimon, and # 74 in the slender Latin &quot;Liber de viris illustribus&quot;, of late and unknown authorship, the main sources for which appear to go back to Varro and his most significant successor in the genre, Gaius Julius Hyginus.

==Family and early career==
Lucullus was a member of the prominent &quot;gens Licinia&quot;, and of the family, or &quot;stirps&quot;, of the Luculli, which may have been descended from the ancient nobility of Tusculum. He was grandson of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, consul in 151 BC, and son of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, praetor in 104 BC, who was convicted for embezzlement during his Sicilian command (104/3) and exiled in .

The family of his mother Caecilia Metella (born ), was a powerful &quot;nobile&quot; family at the height of its success and influence in the last quarter of the 2nd century BC when Lucullus was born. She was the youngest child of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus (consul 142 and censor 115–14), and half-sister of two of the most important influential senators, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus (consul 109 and censor 102) and Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus (consul 119 and Pontifex Maximus), the latter of which was also the father of Sulla&#x27;s third wife Caecilia Metella.

Lucullus possibly served as military tribune in 89 BC; Plutarch notes that he served as an officer under Sulla during the Social War before his quaestorship. He wrote a history of the war in Greek.

==The longest Quaestura, 88–80 BC==
Lucullus was elected Quaestor in winter of 89-88 during the same elections Sulla was chosen as Consul with his friend Quintus Pompeius Rufus (whose son was married to Sulla&#x27;s eldest daughter, Cornelia).
Lucullus was probably the Quaestor mentioned as the sole officer in Sulla&#x27;s army who could stomach accompanying the Consul when he marched on Rome.

In autumn of the same year Sulla sent Lucullus ahead to Greece to assess the situation while he himself oversaw the embarkation of his army. Lucullus arrived in Greece and took over from Quintus Bruttius Sura who had been able to stop the Mithridatic invasion in northern Greece.

When Sulla arrived with the main army, Lucullus served him as a quaestor again; he minted money that was used during the war against Mithridates in southern Greece (87-86 BC). The money Lucullus minted, as per Roman custom, bore his name: the so called &quot;Lucullea&quot;.

===The naval venture, 86–85 BC===
As the Roman siege of Athens was drawing towards a successful conclusion, Sulla&#x27;s strategic attention began to focus more widely on subsequent operations against the main Pontic forces, and combating Mithridates&#x27; control of the sea lanes. He sent Lucullus to collect such a fleet as might be possible from Rome&#x27;s allies along the eastern Mediterranean seaboard, first to the important but currently disturbed states of Cyrene and Ptolemaic Egypt.
Lucullus set out from the Piraeus in mid winter 87-6 BC with three Greek yachts (&quot;myoparones&quot;) and three light Rhodian biremes, hoping to evade the prevailing sea power of the Pontic fleets and their piratic allies by speed and taking advantage of the worst sailing conditions. He initially made Crete, and is said to have won over the cities to the Roman side. From there he crossed to Cyrene where the famous Hellenic colony in Africa was in dire condition following a vicious and exhausting civil war of nearly seven years&#x27; duration. Lucullus&#x27; arrival seems to have put a belated end to this terrible conflict, as the first official Roman presence there since the departure of the proconsul Caius Claudius Pulcher, who presided over its initial administrative incorporation into the Roman Republic in 94 BC. He then sailed to Egypt to try and secure ships from king Ptolemy IX Soter II. In Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt&#x27;s capital, he was well received, but there would be no aid or help. Ptolemy had decided to sail a safe course between Rome and Pontus. From Alexandria Lucullus sailed to Cyprus; evading the Cilician pirates, he went to Rhodos (Rome&#x27;s naval ally). The Rhodians supplied him with additional ships. Rhodos was famous for its naval strength and the marine acumen of its sailors; the Rhodian contingent would turn out to be a most welcome aid. In the waters near Rhodos Lucullus&#x27; fleet defeated a Mithridatic contingent. He then secured Cnidus and Cos, drove the Mithridatic military from Chios, and attacked Samos. From there he would work his way North. Lucullus won another victory off Cape Lecton. From Lecton Lucullus sailed to Tenedos where the Mithridatic fleet lay in wait.

After Lucullus had defeated the Mithridatic admiral Neoptolemus in the Battle of Tenedos, he helped Sulla cross the Aegean to Asia. After a peace had been agreed, Lucullus stayed in Asia and collected the financial penalty Sulla imposed upon the province for its revolt. Lucullus, however, tried to lessen the burden that these impositions created.

===The aftermath of the First Mithridatic War===
Lucullus is noted for his magnanimous administration of Asia province; he managed to calm Rome&#x27;s resentful, near rebellious, Asian subjects and establish a modicum of peace. When Asia&#x27;s Roman governor, Lucius Licinius Murena, started and fought the brief, so-called Second Mithridatic War (83-81 BC), Lucullus was not involved.

Mytilene, capital of the island of Lesbos, rebelled during Lucullus administration of Asia. Lucullus tried to solve the conflict through diplomacy, but eventually he launched an attack on the city state, defeated her militia in a pitched battle in front of her walls and started a siege. After some time Lucullus pretended to give up on the siege and sailed away. When the Mytileneans entered the remnants of his camp, Lucullus ambushed them, killing 500 of the enemy and enslaving 6,000.

==Return to the west, 80–74 BC==

Lucullus returned in 80 BC and was elected curule aedile for 79, along with his brother Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, and gave splendid games.

The most obscure part of Lucullus&#x27; public career is the year he spent as praetor in Rome, followed by his governorship of Roman Africa, which probably lasted the usual two-year span for this province in the post-Sullan period. Plutarch&#x27;s biography entirely ignores this period, 78 BC to 75 BC, jumping from Sulla&#x27;s death to Lucullus&#x27; consulate. However Cicero briefly mentions his praetorship followed by the African command, while the surviving Latin biography, far briefer but more even as biography than Plutarch, comments that he &quot;ruled Africa with the highest degree of justice&quot;. This command is significant in showing Lucullus performing the regular, less glamorous, administrative duties of a public career in the customary sequence and, given his renown as a Philhellene, for the regard he showed for subject peoples who were not Greek.

In these respects his early career demonstrates a generous and just nature, but also his political traditionalism in contrast to contemporaries such as Cicero and Pompey, the former of whom was always eager to avoid administrative responsibilities of any sort in the provinces, while Pompey rejected every aspect of a normal career, seeking great military commands at every opportunity which suited him, while refusing to undertake normal duties in peaceful provinces.

Two other notable transactions took place in 76 or 75 BC following Lucullus&#x27; return from Africa: his marriage to Claudia, the youngest daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, and his purchase of the Marian hilltop villa at Cape Misenum from Sulla&#x27;s eldest daughter Cornelia.

Sulla dedicated his memoirs to Lucullus, and upon his death made him guardian of his son Faustus and daughter Fausta, preferring Lucullus over Pompey.

===Consulship===
In 74 BC, Lucullus served as consul along with Marcus Aurelius Cotta, the half-brother of Aurelia the mother of Julius Caesar. During his consulship he defended Sulla&#x27;s constitution from the efforts of Lucius Quinctius to undermine it. He supported a plea from Pompey, campaigning against the rebel Sertorius on the Iberian peninsula, for funds and reinforcements. He was probably also involved in the decision to make Cyrene into a Roman province.

Initially, he drew Cisalpine Gaul as his proconsular command in the lots, but he got himself appointed governor of Cilicia after its governor (Lucius Octavius) died, reputedly by recommendation from Praecia. He also got himself the command of the Third Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus. This was a highly sought after command for Mithridates ruled very rich lands.

==The Eastern Wars, 73–67 BC==

On his way to Cilicia, his proconsular province, Lucullus landed his legion somewhere in Asia province. He initially planned to march from Asia to western Cilicia and invade Pontus from the south. In Asia province he found the two Fimbrian legions, veterans from the previous Mithridatic Wars, waiting for him. Upon hearing the news of Cotta&#x27;s defeat he set out to relieve the besieged Cotta in Bithynia. Lucullus had to fight Mithridates by land and sea therefore he assembled a large army and also raised a fleet amongst the Greek cities of Asia. With this fleet he defeated the enemy&#x27;s fleet off Ilium and then off Lemnos. On land, through careful manoeuvring and trickery, he was able to trap Mithridates&#x27; army at Cyzicus. According to Appian and Plutarch Lucullus had 30,000 infantry and 1,600-2,500 cavalry while Mithridates was rumoured to have as many as 300,000 men in his force. Since Mithridates had superior numbers Lucullus refused to give battle, he decided to starve his enemy into submission. Lucullus blockaded Mithridates&#x27; huge army on the Cyzicus peninsula and let famine and plague do his work for him. Mithridates was able to escape Lucullus&#x27;s siege, but most of his soldiers perished at Cyzicus.

The Pontic fleet tried to sail east into the Aegean, but Lucullus led his fleet against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of Tenedos and the mainland harbour of the Achaeans. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between Lemnos and Scyros; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea. Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet.

Lucullus finished off the Mithridatic army in Bithynia and then moved through Galatia (which was allied to Rome by now) into Pontus. He was wary of drawing into a direct engagement with Mithridates, due to the latter&#x27;s superior cavalry. However, after several small battles and many skirmishes, Lucullus finally defeated him at the Battle of Cabira. He did not pursue Mithridates immediately, but instead he finished conquering the kingdom of Pontus and setting the affairs of Asia into order. His attempts to reform the rapacious Roman administration in Asia made him increasingly unpopular among the powerful publicani back in Rome.

Mithridates had fled to Armenia and, in 71 BC, Lucullus sent his brother-in-law Appius Claudius Pulcher (later consul in 54 BC) as envoy to the Armenian king-of-kings Tigranes II to demand the surrender of the Pontic king. In the letter conveyed by Appius, Lucullus addressed Tigranes simply as &quot;king&quot; (&quot;basileus&quot;), something received as an insult, and probably intended as such in order to provoke the proud Armenian monarch to war. Keaveney argues against such an interpretation, arguing that Lucullus was acting as a typical philhellene with no empathy towards the sensibilities of non-Greeks. However, this is refuted by Lucullus&#x27; conduct during his administration of Africa (), the period of his career most conspicuously missing from the Greek biography by Plutarch.

In 69 BC, Lucullus invaded Armenia. He began a siege of the new Armenian imperial capital of Tigranocerta in the Arzenene district. Tigranes returned from mopping up a Seleucid rebellion in Syria with an experienced army which Lucullus nonetheless annihilated at the Battle of Tigranocerta. This battle was fought on the same (pre-Julian) calendar date as the Roman disaster at Arausio 36 years earlier, the day before the Nones of October according to the reckoning of the time (or October 6), which is Julian October 16, 69 BC. Tigranes retired to the northern regions of his kingdom to gather another army and defend his hereditary capital of Artaxata, while Lucullus moved off south-eastwards to the kingdom of the Corduene on the frontiers of the Armenian and Parthian empires. During the winter of 69–68 BC both sides opened negotiations with the Parthian king, Arsaces XVI, who was presently defending himself against a major onslaught from his rival Phraates III coming from Bactria and the far east.

In the summer of 68 BC Lucullus resumed the war against Tigranes, crossing the Anti-Taurus Range in a long march through very difficult mountain country directed at the old Armenian capital Artaxata. A battle took place near the River Arsanias, where Lucullus once again routed the Armenian royal army. However, he had misjudged the time needed for a campaign so far into the Armenian Tablelands, where the good weather was unusually short lived, and when the first snows fell around the time of the autumn equinox his army mutinied and refused to advance any further. Lucullus led them back south to the warmer climes of northern Mesopotamia and had no trouble from his troops there despite setting them the difficult task of capturing the great Armenian fortress of Nisibis, which was quickly stormed and made the Roman base for the winter of 68–67 BC.

That winter Lucullus left his army at Nisibis and, taking a small, but apparently highly mobile, escort, journeyed to Syria in an attempt to permanently exclude Tigranes from all his southern possessions. Syria had been an Armenian province since 83 BC. About a decade later the dispossessed Seleucid princes had spent two years in Rome (one of them probably during Lucullus&#x27;s consulship in 74 BC) lobbying the Senate and Roman aristocracy to make them (as legitimate Seleucids with a Ptolemaic mother) kings of Egypt in place of the illegitimate Ptolemy XII Auletes. Though these brothers left Rome empty handed in about 72 BC, their plight was not forgotten and Lucullus now elevated one of them as king of Syria: Antiochus XIII, known as &quot;Asiaticus&quot; owing to the time he had spent living in Roman Asia province. Lucullus&#x27; old friend Antiochus of Ascalon accompanied him on this journey and died at Antioch.
However, in his absence his authority over his army at Nisibis was seriously undermined by the youngest and wildest of the Claudian brothers, Publius Clodius Pulcher, apparently acting in the interests of Pompey, who was eager to succeed Lucullus in the Mithridatic War command. Although a brother-in-law of Lucullus, Clodius was also &quot;frater&quot; in some form (whether a first cousin &quot;frater consobrinus&quot; or uterine brother) of Pompey&#x27;s wife Mucia Tertia. The long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus&#x27; troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder, had caused increasing insubordination. The more daring and ruthless veterans had probably been further encouraged by Lucullus&#x27; relatively mild acceptance of their first open mutiny in the Tablelands the previous autumn -especially the so-called Fimbrian legions who had murdered their first commander Lucius Valerius Flaccus and abandoned their second commander Gaius Flavius Fimbria. Instigated by Clodius, a series of demonstrations against the commander took place in his absence and by the time of his return he had largely lost control of his army and could not conduct further offensive operations. In addition Mithridates had returned to Pontus during the same winter, and crushed the garrison force Lucullus had left there under his legates Sornatius Barba and Fabius Hadrianus. Lucullus was left with no choice but to retreat to Pontus and Cappadocia and did so in the spring of 67 BC.

Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus had still not captured either one of the monarchs. In 66 BC, with the majority of Lucullus&#x27; troops now openly refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend Roman positions from attack, the senate sent Pompey to take over Lucullus&#x27; command, at which point Lucullus returned to Rome.

Lucullus established a magnificient library of Greek texts. These books came from the Pontic kingdom of Mithridates VI, which had been seized by Lucullus, who was renowned for his admiration of Greek culture.

==Final years, 66–57 BC==

The opposition to him continued on his return. In his absence Pompey had shamefully usurped control over Sulla&#x27;s children, contrary to the father&#x27;s testament, and now in Pompeius&#x27; absence the latter&#x27;s intimate and hereditary political ally Gaius Memmius co-ordinated the opposition to Lucullus&#x27; claim to a triumph. Memmius delivered at least four speeches &quot;de triumpho Luculli Asiatico&quot;, and the antagonism towards Lucullus aroused by the Pompeians proved so effective that the enabling law (&quot;lex curiata&quot;) required to hold a triumph was delayed for three years. In this period Lucullus was forced to reside outside the &quot;pomerium&quot;, which curtailed his involvement in day-to-day politics centred on the Forum.

Instead of returning fully to political life (although, as a friend of Cicero, he did act in some issues) he mostly retired to extravagant leisure, or, in Plutarch&#x27;s words:
He used the vast treasure he amassed during his wars in the East to live a life of luxury. He had several known luxurious villas: 
*the Gardens of Lucullus in Rome
*the vast Villa of Lucullus near Naples
*the famous one near Tusculum
*one on the promontory of Misenum
*one on the island of Nisida in the Bay of Naples.

The one near Neapolis included fish ponds and man-made extensions into the sea, and was only one of many elite senators&#x27; villas around the Bay of Naples. Pompey is said by Pliny and Vellleius Paterculus to have referred often to Lucullus as &quot;Xerxes in a toga&quot;.

He finally held his triumph in 63 BC thanks in small part to the political manoeuvering of both Cato and Cicero. His triumph was remembered mostly due to his covering the Circus Flaminius with the arms of the enemies he had faced during the campaign. Lucullus also displayed to the Roman public a golden statue of Mithridates VI, standing two meters tall, along with his jewel-encrusted shield, silver vessels, and golden chalices. These items were transported in twenty litters, while mules carried eight expensive klinē.

===Gastronome===
So famous did Lucullus become for his banqueting that the word now means &quot;lavish,&quot; &quot;luxurious&quot; and &quot;gourmet&quot;.

Once, Cicero and Pompey succeeded in inviting themselves to dinner with Lucullus, but, curious to see what sort of meal Lucullus ate when alone, forbade him to communicate with his slaves regarding any preparation of the meal for his guests. However, Lucullus outsmarted them, and succeeded in getting Pompey and Cicero to allow that he specify which room he would be dining in. He ordered that his slaves serve him in the Apollo Room, knowing that his service staff was schooled ahead of time as to the specific details of service he expected for each of his particular dining rooms: as the standard amount specified to be outlaid for any given dinner in the Apollo room was the large sum of 50,000 drachmae, Cicero and Pompey found themselves a short time later dining upon a most unexpectedly luxurious meal.

On another occasion, the tale runs that his steward, hearing that he would have no guests for dinner, served only one not especially impressive course. Lucullus reprimanded him saying, &quot;What, did not you know, then, that today Lucullus dines with Lucullus?&quot;

Among Lucullus&#x27; other contributions to fine dining, he was responsible for bringing the sour cherry, (a species of) the sweet cherry and the apricot to Rome, developing major facilities for aquaculture, and being the only person in Rome with the ability to provide thrushes for gastronomic purposes in every season, having his own fattening coops. Cicero once called Lucullus &#x27;Piscinarius&#x27; - fish fancier.

Among the various edible plants associated with Lucullus is a cultivar of the vegetable Swiss chard (&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;); which is named &quot;Lucullus&quot; in his honour.

===Lucullus and higher learning===

Lucullus was extremely well educated in Latin and Greek, and showed a keen interest in literature and philosophy from earliest adulthood. He established lifelong friendships with the Greek poet Archias of (Syrian) Antioch, who migrated to Rome around 102 BC, and with one of the leading academic philosophers of the time, Antiochus of Ascalon.

During his long delay in the royal palace at Alexandria in the summer of 86 BC Lucullus witnessed the beginning of the major schism in the Platonic Academy in the 1st century BC, the so-called Sosos Affair. His friend and companion Antiochos of Ascalon received, evidently from the Library of Alexandria, a copy of a work by the scholarch of the Academy, Philo of Larissa, so radical in its sceptical stance that Antiochos was sufficiently disturbed to doubt the attribution of authorship to his old teacher. But more recent pupils of Philo, chiefly Herakleitos of Tyre, were able to assure him of the book&#x27;s authenticity. Antiochos and Herakleitos dissected it at length in Lucullus&#x27; presence, and in the ensuing weeks while the Roman party continued to await the arrival of the king from the south, Antiochos composed a vigorous polemic against Philo entitled &quot;Sosos&quot;, which marked his definitive break with Philo&#x27;s so-called &quot;Sceptical Academy&quot;, and the beginning of the separate, more conservative, school eventually called the Old Academy.

===Decline and death===
Plutarch reports that Lucullus lost his mind towards the end of his life, intermittently developing signs of insanity as he aged. Plutarch, however, seems to be somewhat ambivalent as to whether the apparent madness was actually the result of the administration of a purported love potion or other explicable cause, hinting that his alleged precipitous mental decline (and his concomitant withdrawal from public affairs) may have been at least in part conveniently feigned in self-protection against the rise to power of his political opponents, such as the popular party, during a time in which the political stakes were often life and death. Lucullus&#x27; brother Marcus oversaw his funeral.

His tomb has been located near his villa in Tusculum.

==Marriages==
Lucullus married Clodia, (one of the daughters of Appius Claudius Pulcher the consul of 79 BC) at the earliest 76 BC. With her he had a daughter and possibly a homonymous son. He divorced her about the year 66 BC, on his return to Rome after friction in Asia with her brother, Publius Clodius Pulcher.

He then married Servilia, the daughter of Livia and Quintus Servilius Caepio, sister of Servilia Major, and half-sister of Cato the Younger; notorious for her loose morals, Servilia cheated on him, but he forced himself to stay with her out of respect for her half-brother Cato. They had a son named Marcus. When Lucullus died he made Cato the guardian of the boy.
