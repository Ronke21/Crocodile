<text>In calculus, the squeeze theorem (also known as the sandwich theorem, among other names) is a theorem regarding the limit of a function that is bounded between two other functions.

The squeeze theorem is used in calculus and mathematical analysis, typically to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known. It was first used geometrically by the mathematicians Archimedes and Eudoxus in an effort to compute , and was formulated in modern terms by Carl Friedrich Gauss.

== Statement ==
The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.
* The functions and are said to be lower and upper bounds (respectively) of .
* Here, is &quot;not&quot; required to lie in the interior of . Indeed, if is an endpoint of , then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.
* A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if , then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as .
This theorem is also valid for sequences. Let be two sequences converging to , and a sequence. If formula_1 we have , then also converges to .

===Proof===
According to the above hypotheses we have, taking the limit inferior and superior:
formula_2
so all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.

A direct proof, using the -definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real there exists a real such that for all with formula_3 we have formula_4 Symbolically,

formula_5

As

formula_6

means that
and 
formula_7

means that
then we have

formula_8
formula_9

We can choose formula_10. Then, if formula_11, combining () and (), we have

formula_12
formula_13

which completes the proof. Q.E.D

The proof for sequences is very similar, using the formula_14-definition of the limit of a sequence.

== Examples ==

=== First example ===

The limit

formula_15

cannot be determined through the limit law

formula_16

because

formula_17

does not exist.

However, by the definition of the sine function,

formula_18

It follows that

formula_19

Since formula_20, by the squeeze theorem, formula_21 must also be 0.

=== Second example ===

Probably the best-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities
formula_22

The first limit follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that

formula_23

for close enough to 0. The correctness of which for positive can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that

formula_24
for close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing in the earlier fact by formula_25 and squaring the resulting inequality.

These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function. That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.

=== Third example ===

It is possible to show that
formula_26
by squeezing, as follows.

In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is

formula_27

since the radius is and the arc on the unit circle has length . Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is

formula_28

What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots. The length of the base of the triangle is , and the height is 1. The area of the triangle is therefore

formula_29

From the inequalities

formula_30

we deduce that

formula_31

provided , and the inequalities are reversed if . Since the first and third expressions approach as , and the middle expression approaches formula_32 the desired result follows.

=== Fourth example ===

The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.

formula_33

cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since

formula_34 

therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

formula_35

<doc id="330999" wikidata="Q1988079" url="?curid=330999" title="Dutch colonisation of the Guianas">
<text>The Dutch began their colonisation of the Guianas, the coastal region between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers in South America, in the late 16th century. The Dutch originally claimed all of Guiana (also called &quot;De wilde kust&quot;, the &quot;Wild Coast&quot;) but—following attempts to sell it first to Bavaria and then to Hanau and the loss of sections to Portugal, Britain, and France—the section actually settled and controlled by the Netherlands became known as Dutch Guiana (Dutch: &quot;Nederlands-Guiana&quot;).

The colonies of Essequibo and Demerara were controlled by the Dutch West India Company, while Berbice and Surinam were controlled by the Society of Berbice and the Society of Suriname, respectively. Cayenne also came under brief periods of Dutch control. After the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, Britain gained control of the three colonies (Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo) west of the Courantyne River, which became British Guiana and then modern Guyana. The remaining colony, Suriname (also called &quot;Dutch Guiana&quot;), remained under Dutch control until its independence in 1975.

==History==
===Origin===

In 1598, a fleet of three Dutch ships visiting the Wild Coast mention passing the river &quot;Surinamo&quot; a year after the English had done the same. The next year saw the first cartographic reference to the region: a 1599 map drawing on the account of this voyage, drawn by Flemish geographer Jodocus Hondius. Beginning in 1581, the colonies were settled by Dutch colonists, most of whom came from the province of Zeeland. Trading posts were established near various rivers, including the Pomeroon, Essequibo, Berbice, and Suriname rivers. Many small commercial establishments, mostly bartering posts, were founded by French, Dutch, and English colonists. Due to the effects of disease and attacks from natives, these colonies rarely lasted long.

===Establishment===
The Dutch West India Company was created in 1621, and given unsupervised control of the colonies in South America. The colony was administered by Abraham van Peere, a Dutch explorer who had founded the settlement of Berbice. After the Third Anglo-Dutch War, England ceded the colony of Suriname, in exchange for New Amsterdam.

Dutch Guiana was not a political entity, but, rather, a geographical indication. The colonies that formed along Dutch Guiana were, initially, controlled by several entities. Essequibo and Demerara were controlled by the Dutch West India Company, while Berbice and Suriname were controlled by the Society of Berbice and the Society of Suriname, respectively. Pernambuco and settlements farther west, including Portuguese Guiana, now the Brazilian state of Amapá, was under Dutch control from 1630 to 1654. Cayenne (French Guiana) was also briefly controlled by the Dutch between 1660 and 1664, and again between 1676 and 1677.

===Dissolution===

Under the Batavian Republic, much of Dutch Guiana was once again occupied by the British. After the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, Britain gained control of the three colonies (Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo) west of the Courantyne River. These three colonies became British Guiana. After 1815, there were five Guianas, referred to by their dominant languages: Spanish Guayana (Venezuela), British Guiana, Dutch Guiana, French Guiana, and Portuguese Guiana (Brazil).

The colony that remained was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands until 1975, when it became independent as the Republic of Suriname.

==Geography==
Dutch Guiana covered the majority of the Guiana Shield, with its borders ranging from the Orinoco Delta in the northwest, the eastern banks of the Caroní River in the southwest, to the Marajó island of the Amazon River delta in the southeast.

==Dutch Guiana or Suriname==
Although the colony of Surinam has always been officially known as such or as Suriname, in both Dutch and English, the colony was often unofficially and semi-officially referred to as Dutch Guiana (Dutch: &quot;Nederlands Guiana&quot;) in the 19th and 20th century, in an analogy to British Guiana and French Guiana. Historically, Suriname was only one of many Dutch colonies in the Guianas, others being Berbice, Essequibo, Demerara, and Pomeroon, which after being taken over by the United Kingdom in 1814, were united into British Guiana in 1831. The Dutch also controlled northern Brazil from 1630 to 1654, including the area that, when governed by Lisbon, was called Portuguese Guiana. Thus, before 1814, the term Dutch Guiana did not describe only Suriname, but rather all colonies under Dutch sovereignty in the region taken together: a set of polities, with distinct governments, whose external borders changed much over time.

<doc id="331001" wikidata="Q319029" url="?curid=331001" title="Yigal Amir">
<text>Yigal Amir (; born May 31, 1970) is an Israeli right-wing extremist who assassinated incumbent Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995, at the conclusion of a rally in Tel Aviv, Israel. At the time of the murder, he was a law student at Bar-Ilan University. Amir is serving a life sentence for murder plus six years for injuring Rabin&#x27;s bodyguard. He was later sentenced to an additional eight years for conspiracy to murder. Amir has never expressed regret over the assassination.

Numerous radical right-wing Israeli organisations have carried out campaigns for Amir&#x27;s release. The Shin Bet security service has assessed that Amir remains a threat to national security. The Knesset passed a law preventing the President of Israel from pardoning the assassin of a prime minister.

== Early life ==
Amir was born in Herzliya to an Israeli Orthodox Yemenite Jewish family, one of eight children. His father Shlomo was a &quot;sofer&quot; (scribe) who held a post supervising the kosher slaughtering of chickens and taught Shabbat lessons at a local synagogue. His mother Geula was a kindergarten teacher and ran a nursery school in the family home&#x27;s backyard. Amir attended an Independent Education System school in Herzliya, and a high school &quot;yeshiva&quot; in Tel Aviv. He did his military service in the Israel Defense Forces as a &quot;Hesder&quot; student, combining army service in a religious platoon of the Golani Brigade with religious study at &quot;Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh&quot;. Despite being in a religious unit, even his comrades considered him a religious fanatic.

Following his military service, Amir was nominated by the religious-Zionist youth movement Bnei Akiva to teach Judaism in Riga, Latvia, as part of the Nativ organization.

In 1993, Amir began studying at Bar-Ilan University as part of its &quot;kollel&quot; program, mixing religious and secular studies. Amir studied law and computer science, as well as Jewish law at the Institute for Advanced Torah Studies. Amir was strongly opposed to the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. He participated in protest rallies against the accords on campus, was active in organizing weekend bus outings to support Israeli settlers, and helped found an illegal settlement outpost. He was especially active in Hebron, where he led marches through the streets.

During his years as an activist, Amir became friendly with Avishai Raviv, to whom he allegedly revealed his plan to kill Rabin. After the murder, it was revealed that Raviv, a well known right-wing extremist at the time, was in fact only posing as a right-wing radical. In reality, he was working for Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service. While some right-wing militants have accused the Shin Bet of having orchestrated the assassination to discredit them, a court later ruled that there was no evidence Raviv knew Amir was plotting to kill Rabin.

In 1994, during his university studies, Amir met—and began a platonic relationship with—Nava Holtzman, a law student from an Orthodox Ashkenazi family. In January 1995, after five months, Holtzman ended the relationship after her parents objected due to Amir&#x27;s Mizrahi background. She married one of his friends soon afterward. Amir, who attended the wedding, went into a deep depression.

== Assassination ==

On November 4, 1995, after a demonstration in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in support of the Oslo Accords, Amir waited for Rabin in a parking lot adjacent to the square, close to Rabin&#x27;s official limousine. There, he shot Rabin twice with a Beretta 84F .380 ACP-caliber semi-automatic pistol, and injured Yoram Rubin, a security guard, with a third shot. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin&#x27;s bodyguards. Rabin was rushed to Ichilov Hospital where he died on an operating table 40 minutes later of blood loss and a punctured lung. According to the court, Yigal Amir&#x27;s brother Hagai and his friend Dror Adani were his accomplices in the assassination plan.

Upon hearing that Rabin was dead, Amir told the police that he was &quot;satisfied&quot; and was acting on the &quot;orders of God&quot;. At his trial, Amir said he did not care if the outcome was death or paralysis as long as Rabin was &quot;out of the way&quot;. He expressed no regret for his actions.

===Failed attempts===
The assassination had been preceded by three unsuccessful attempts that same year: at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, at the Nof Yerushalayim Hotel, and at a ceremony inaugurating a highway in Kfar Shmaryahu. These plans fell through moments before implementation.

==Trial==
Amir&#x27;s trial lasted from January 23 to March 27, 1996. He was initially defended by attorneys Yonatan Ray Goldberg and Mordechai Ofri, and later by Gabi Shachar and Shmuel Flishman. He was prosecuted by Pnina Guy, head of the Tel Aviv District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. The three judges who heard the case were presiding judge Edmond Levy and judges Saviona Rotlevy and Oded Mudrik. The judges ordered a mental examination by three district psychiatrists and a clinical psychiatrist, who all agreed that Amir understood the meaning of his actions and was fit to stand trial.
Amir admitted to shooting Rabin and attempted to justify his actions on religious grounds, claiming that shooting Rabin was an act of &quot;din rodef&quot; (&quot;law of the pursuer&quot;), which would allow killing to prevent the deaths of innocent Jews. He also claimed he had only intended to paralyze Rabin and not kill him. The court rejected his arguments, and he was found guilty of the murder of Rabin and inflicting injury under aggravating circumstances over the wounding of Yoram Rubin. Amir was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Rabin plus six additional years in prison for injuring Rubin. In the verdict, the three judges wrote: 
Every murder is an abominable act, but the act before us is more abominable sevenfold, because not only has the accused not expressed regret or sorrow, but he also seeks to show that he is at peace with himself over the act that he perpetrated. He who so calmly cuts short another&#x27;s life, only proves the depth of wretchedness to which [his] values have fallen, and thus he does not merit any regard whatsoever, except pity, because he has lost his humanity.

Amir&#x27;s claim that he was acting in accordance with Jewish law was rejected by the judges: &quot;The attempt to grant religious authority to the murder ... is completely inappropriate and amounts to cynical exploitation of Jewish law for goals that are alien to Judaism.&quot;

Rabin&#x27;s assassination was condemned by Bar-Ilan University. Daniel Sperber, a professor of Talmud at the university, said that the assassination &quot;in no way represents the university or the policy of the university&quot;.

Amir was later sentenced to an additional five years, and after an appeal on behalf of the state, eight years, for conspiring to commit the assassination with his brother Hagai Amir and Dror Adani. All of the sentences were cumulative. In Israel, a sentence of life imprisonment is usually reduced to a period of 20–30 years by the president, with the possibility of further reduction for good behaviour. However, President Moshe Katsav did not reduce the sentence, saying that there is &quot;no forgiveness, no absolution, and no pardon&quot; for Yigal Amir. Prime ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Olmert have also said that Yigal Amir will never be released from prison.

On December 19, 2001, the Knesset, by majority of 62 members, approved the Yigal Amir Law, which prohibits a parole board from recommending pardon or shortening time in prison for a murderer of a prime minister. His legal team and supporters deride the law as being tailor made to punish Amir, being applied retrospectively. Amir began appealing on these grounds in December 2020 to the High Court of Justice against the law.

== Prison conditions ==
Amir was held in solitary confinement in Beersheba&#x27;s Eshel Prison, and moved in 2003 to the Ayalon Prison in Ramla, where a solitary confinement wing was built especially for him. In 2006, he was transferred to Rimonim Prison in Tel Mond, near Netanya. He was also granted the privileges of having no surveillance cameras in his cell, the right to receive visitors in the visiting room, rather than in his cell, and the right to speak with other prisoners. Amir was interviewed by the Israeli press in 2008, but the planned broadcast was controversial and subsequently cancelled. As punishment for giving the interview, Amir was moved to Ramon Prison, and had a number of privileges withdrawn, including the removal of his TV and DVD player and the refusal of family visits; Amir went on a hunger strike in protest. In February 2010, the Nazareth District Court permitted the &quot;Ynet&quot; internet news service to interview Amir.

In July 2010, after 15 years of solitary confinement, Amir appealed to the Petah Tikva District Court to be permitted to participate in group prayers in accordance with Jewish law. He claimed that the terms of his imprisonment were worse than any other prisoner in the history of the State of Israel, on the grounds that no other prisoner had been in solitary for this amount of time. He said that failure to allow him to pray in synagogue would be a violation of his right to freedom of worship. In August 2010, the court ruled that Amir would be allowed to meet another prisoner for prayer three times a week, and that he would be allowed to study Torah with another prisoner once every two weeks.

In July 2012, it was announced that Amir would no longer be held in solitary confinement. Under his new prison conditions, he would be allowed to watch television and use a phone more frequently. Though he was not moved to an open cell block, where prisoners are allowed to spend most of the day outside their cells, he was given the right to meet other prisoners during his two hours&#x27; exercise in the prison yard.

In 2019, Amir&#x27;s telephone was confiscated by prison authorities for two months after he used it for political purposes in violation of prison regulations. He had called rapper and right-wing political activist Yoav Eliasi and urged him to fight for his release, a request which Eliasi rejected. In protest, Amir launched a hunger strike and was subsequently penalized with seven days in solitary confinement in a cell with downgraded amenities.

== Campaigns for Amir&#x27;s release ==
Amir&#x27;s appeals of both sentences were rejected. Subsequently, a law was passed by the Knesset barring the pardon by the President of Israel for any assassin of a prime minister. Amir has never expressed regret for his actions. , the Amir family and the &quot;Committee for Democracy&quot; campaigned to release Yigal and Hagai Amir. The campaign includes statements for the media, stickers, posters, and short films.

From time to time, radical Israeli right-wing organisations carry out campaigns (via posters or videos) that call for Amir to be released. Such a campaign was held in October 2007 in which the prominent Israeli singer Ariel Zilber also participated. In response to this campaign, the Israeli Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter stated: &quot;This man is in the closest status a person can be to a death sentence&quot;, and also added that, &quot;A reduction of his sentence is impossible and illogical, and it will surely accompany him until he would pass away&quot;.

His brother Hagai was released from prison on May 4, 2012, after serving 16 years of his sentence. Hagai, who claims to have no regrets and be &quot;proud of what I did&quot;, was protested by left-wing individuals, allegedly including many members of the Knesset, such as Shelly Yachimovich, quoted as saying Hagai&#x27;s public pride in the act was &quot;a monstrous and disgusting act”. Since his release, Hagai has campaigned for the release of his brother. Hagai Amir was re-arrested and sentenced to house arrest in 2015 for a Facebook post wishing death on President Reuven Rivlin.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
Amir is married to Larisa Trembovler, who was born in Russia. She has a PhD in philosophy. She has published a novel in Russian (&quot;A Mirror for a Prince&quot;), and is an Orthodox Jew. She met Amir in Latvia, where he was teaching Judaism. After her immigration to Israel, she visited Amir with her then-husband, Benjamin (with whom she has four children), for humanitarian reasons. She expressed ideological support for Amir, and they began to correspond and speak on the phone. She divorced Benjamin in 2003.

Trembovler announced that she was engaged to Amir and wanted to marry him, while he was in jail. In January 2004, after their request was filed, the Israel Prisons Service declared it would not permit the marriage. In April 2004, the matter was brought before the Tel Aviv District Court. At the time, the Prisons Commissioner instructed his legal aides to defend the decision based on security considerations. Amir&#x27;s lawyers, however, said this claim violated their client&#x27;s basic rights and would not hold up in court. They noted that several Palestinians serving multiple life terms for crimes such as murder have been permitted to marry in prison. Legal analysts have said the Supreme Court would likely uphold any appeal by Amir&#x27;s lawyer, unless specific legislation is enacted prohibiting him from marrying. In August 2004, Trembovler and Amir were wed in a surreptitious proxy marriage. Under Jewish law, a prospective husband can grant a form of &quot;power of attorney&quot; to a chosen representative, who can then transfer a wedding ring, or something of similar value, to the prospective wife. In July 2005, their marriage was validated by an Israeli rabbinical court. Trembovler submitted a petition after the Interior Ministry refused to register her and Amir as a married couple. Israel&#x27;s Justice Ministry defined Amir&#x27;s marriage as &quot;problematic&quot; because according to a past ruling, a marriage ceremony not conducted in the presence of a rabbi from the Chief Rabbinate is unrecognised.

====Conjugal visits and artificial insemination====
On February 6, 2006, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that Attorney General Menachem Mazuz had ordered the Interior Ministry to register Amir and Trembovler as a married couple. They then filed requests with the Prison Authority and petitions to court to enable them to hold conjugal visits or conceive a child through artificial insemination.

In March 2006, the Israeli Prison Service approved Amir&#x27;s petition for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The service was to study how this process would be conducted without Amir leaving the prison. A week later, Amir was caught handing a pre-prepared bag of semen to his wife, and the visit was terminated. After the incident, a disciplinary tribunal barred visits from his wife for 30 days, and phone calls for 14 days. He was fined NIS 100 (then US$21). When the IVF treatments were withheld due to a petition by several members of Knesset, Amir went on a hunger strike. After being warned that hunger strikes are in violation of prison regulations, some of his privileges were canceled.

Up until October 20, 2006, the Shin Bet security service had opposed unsupervised visits. Four days later, Amir was allowed a 10-hour-long conjugal visit. Five months later, it was reported that Trembovler was pregnant. On October 28, 2007, she gave birth to a son, who was named Yinon Eliya Shalom. The brit milah was held in prison on November 4, 2007, the 12th anniversary of Rabin&#x27;s assassination.

In 2020, Amir requested a furlough from prison to attend his son&#x27;s bar mitzvah, which the Israel Prison Service denied. Amir appealed the decision to the Beersheba District Court, which upheld the refusal.

==In popular culture==
On July 8, 2015, a documentary on Yigal Amir, &quot;Beyond the Fear&quot;, premiered in Jerusalem. The film explored the thorny drama of the Moscow-born intellectual Larisa Trembovler, who married assassin Yigal Amir after he was sentenced to life in prison and, following a court battle for a conjugal visit, gave birth to their son in 2007. The late filmmaker Herz Frank, who died in 2013, spent about 10 years following Trembovler, receiving unprecedented access to her and their son, Yinon. Rabin&#x27;s granddaughter called the film a &quot;cynical use of the freedom of expression with intent to harm it&quot;.

The 2019 film &quot;Incitement&quot; consists of a portrayal of the factors that led Amir to commit the assassination. Debuting at Sundance, the movie went on to win the 2019 Ophir Award.

<text>William Griffith Wilson (November 26, 1895 – January 24, 1971), also known as Bill Wilson or Bill W., was the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) with Bob Smith.

AA is an international mutual aid fellowship with about two million members worldwide belonging to AA groups, associations, organizations, cooperatives, and fellowships of alcoholics helping other alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety. Following AA&#x27;s Twelfth Tradition of anonymity, Wilson is commonly known as &quot;Bill W.&quot; or &quot;Bill&quot;. To identify each other, members of AA will sometimes ask others if they are &quot;friends of Bill&quot;. After Wilson&#x27;s death, and amidst controversy within the fellowship, his full name was included in obituaries by journalists who were unaware of the significance of maintaining anonymity within the organization.

Wilson&#x27;s sobriety from alcohol, which he maintained until his death, began December 11, 1934. In 1955, Wilson turned over control of AA to a board of trustees. Wilson died in 1971 of emphysema from smoking tobacco complicated by pneumonia. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; listed him as &quot;Bill W.: The Healer&quot; in the &quot;Time&quot; 100: The Most Important People of the Century.

==Early life==

Wilson was born on November 26, 1895, in East Dorset, Vermont, the son of Emily (née Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson. He was born at his parents&#x27; home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His sister, Dorothy, was born in 1898. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, a hotelier and second-generation marble worker, was also an alcoholic. Influenced by the preaching of an itinerant evangelist, some weeks before, William C. Wilson climbed to the top of Mount Aeolus, had a spiritual experience and quit drinking.

Wilson&#x27;s father left for Canada in 1905, and his mother left soon after to study osteopathic medicine in Massachusetts. Abandoned by his parents, he and his sister were raised by their maternal grandparents, Fayette and Ella Griffith.

By 1908 he had met Mark Whalon, a fellow East Dorset resident who was nine years Wilson&#x27;s senior. Whalon became Wilson&#x27;s closest childhood friend, and introduced him to the world of ideas. Whalon continued to be a confidant, counselor, and emotional support to Wilson, even after Wilson became world famous, and as of Whalon&#x27;s death in 1956 was still Wilson&#x27;s best friend. Wilson later wrote of him, &quot;He was a sort of uncle or father to me.&quot;

Wilson became the captain of his high school&#x27;s football team, and the principal violinist in its orchestra. He dealt with a serious bout of depression at the age of 17, following the death of his first love, Bertha Bamford, who died of complications from surgery.

==Marriage, work, and alcoholism==

Wilson met his wife Lois Burnham during the summer of 1913 while sailing on Vermont&#x27;s Emerald Lake; two years later, the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but he was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident. No one would take responsibility, and no one would identify the perpetrators, so the entire class was punished.

Pancho Villa&#x27;s incursion into the U.S. in June 1916 resulted in Wilson&#x27;s class being mobilized as part of the Vermont National Guard, and he was reinstated to serve. The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in Massachusetts, the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of beer with little effect. A few weeks later at another dinner party, he drank some Bronx cocktails and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness. &quot;I had found the elixir of life&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next time or two I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that.&quot;

Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, just before he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his military service, he returned to live with his wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too drunk to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. During these trips, Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped that the travel would keep Wilson from drinking. However, Wilson&#x27;s constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.

In 1933, Wilson was committed to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times under the care of William Duncan Silkworth. Silkworth&#x27;s theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started), and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth&#x27;s assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to &quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;wet brain&quot;).

==A spiritual program for recovery==
In November 1934, Wilson was visited by an old drinking companion, Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded to find Thacher had been sober for weeks under the guidance of the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher&#x27;s visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns under Silkworth&#x27;s care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. There, Bill W had a &quot;White Light&quot; spiritual experience and quit drinking. Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol. He was also given belladonna, which causes hallucinations. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!&quot; He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the rest of his life. Wilson described his experience to Silkworth, who told him, &quot;Something has happened to you I don&#x27;t understand. But you had better hang on to it&quot;.

Wilson joined the Oxford Group and tried to help other alcoholics. They did not get sober, but Wilson kept sober himself. During a failed business trip to Akron, Ohio, Wilson was tempted to drink again and decided that to remain sober he needed to help another alcoholic. He called phone numbers in a church directory and eventually secured an introduction to Bob Smith, an alcoholic Oxford Group member. Wilson explained Silkworth&#x27;s theory that alcoholics suffer from a physical allergy and a mental obsession. Wilson shared that the only way he was able to stay sober was through having had a spiritual experience. Smith was familiar with the tenets of the Oxford Group, and upon hearing of Wilson&#x27;s experience, &quot;began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness that he had never before been able to muster. After a brief relapse, he sobered, never to drink again...&quot; Wilson and Smith began working with other alcoholics. After that summer in Akron, Wilson returned to New York where he began having success helping alcoholics in what they called &quot;a nameless squad of drunks&quot; in an Oxford Group there.

In 1938, after about 100 alcoholics in Akron and New York had become sober, the &#x27;fellowship&#x27; decided to promote its program of recovery through the publication of a book, for which Wilson was chosen as primary author. The book was given the title &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; and included the list of suggested activities for spiritual growth known as the Twelve Steps. The movement itself took on the name of the book. Bill incorporated the principles of nine of the Twelve Traditions, (a set of spiritual guidelines to ensure the survival of individual AA groups) in his foreword to the original edition; later, Traditions One, Two, and Ten were clearly specified when all twelve statements were published. The AA general service conference of 1955 was a landmark event for Wilson in which he turned over the leadership of the maturing organization to an elected board.

In 1939, Wilson and Marty Mann visited High Watch Farm in Kent, CT. They would go on to found what is now High Watch Recovery Center, the world&#x27;s first alcohol and addiction recovery center founded on Twelve Step principles.

==Political beliefs==
Wilson strongly advocated that AA groups have not the &quot;slightest reform or political complexion&quot;. In 1946, he wrote &quot;No AA group or members should ever, in such a way as to implicate AA, express any opinion on outside controversial issues – particularly those of politics, alcohol reform or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics Anonymous groups oppose no one. Concerning such matters they can express no views whatever.&quot; Reworded, this became AA&#x27;s &quot;Tradition 10&quot;.

==The final years==
During the last years of his life, Wilson rarely attended AA meetings to avoid being asked to speak as the co-founder rather than as an alcoholic. A heavy smoker, Wilson eventually suffered from emphysema and later pneumonia. He continued to smoke while dependent on an oxygen tank in the late 1960s. While notes written by nurse James Dannenberg say that Bill Wilson asked for whiskey four times (December 25, 1970, January 2, 1971, January 8, 1971, and January 14, 1971) in his final month of living, he drank no alcohol for the final 36 years of his life.

==Alleged marital infidelity==
Francis Hartigan, biographer of Bill Wilson and personal secretary to Lois Wilson in her later years, wrote that in the mid-1950s Bill began a fifteen-year affair with Helen Wynn, a woman 18 years his junior whom he met through AA. Hartigan also asserts that this relationship was preceded by other marital infidelities. Wilson arranged in 1963 to leave 10% of his book royalties to Helen Wynn, and the rest to his wife Lois.

Historian Ernest Kurtz was skeptical of the veracity of the reports of Wilson&#x27;s womanizing. He judged that the reports were traceable to a single person, Tom Powers, a formerly close friend of Wilson&#x27;s with whom he had a falling-out in the mid-1950s.

==Archives at Stepping Stones==
Personal letters between Wilson and Lois spanning a period of more than 60 years are kept in the archives at Stepping Stones, their former home in Katonah, New York, and in AA&#x27;s General Service Office archives in New York.

==Psychedelic therapy==

In the 1950s, Wilson used LSD in medically supervised experiments with Betty Eisner, Gerald Heard, and Aldous Huxley, taking LSD for the first time on August 29, 1956. With Wilson&#x27;s invitation, his wife Lois and Nell Wing also participated in such experiments. Later, Wilson wrote to Carl Jung, praising the results and recommending it as a validation of Jung&#x27;s spiritual experience. (The letter was not in fact sent as Jung had died.) According to Wilson, the session allowed him to re-experience a spontaneous spiritual experience he had had years before, which had enabled him to overcome his own alcoholism.

Bill was enthusiastic about his experience; he felt it helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that stand in the way of one&#x27;s direct experience of the cosmos and of God. He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: &quot;It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God&#x27;s grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are goingwell, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced.&quot; Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.

In 1957, Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: &quot;I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions.&quot; Most AAs were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance. Wilson continued his use of LSD well into the 1960s, convincing his wife, his secretary, and his spiritual advisor to try it with him. He even wrote letters to Carl Jung and Timothy Leary raving of its benefits.

==Niacin therapy==
Wilson met Abram Hoffer and learned about the potential mood-stabilizing effects of niacin. Wilson was impressed with experiments indicating that alcoholics who were given niacin had a better sobriety rate, and he began to see niacin &quot;as completing the third leg in the stool, the physical to complement the spiritual and emotional&quot;. Wilson also believed that niacin had given him relief from depression, and he promoted the vitamin within the AA community and with the National Institute of Mental Health as a treatment for schizophrenia. However, Wilson created a major furor in AA because he used the AA office and letterhead in his promotion.

==Spiritualism==
For Wilson, spiritualism was a lifelong interest. One of his letters to adviser Father Dowling suggests that while Wilson was working on his book &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;, he felt that spirits were helping him, in particular a 15th-century monk named Boniface. Despite his conviction that he had evidence for the reality of the spirit world, Wilson chose not to share this with AA. However, his practices still created controversy within the AA membership. Wilson and his wife continued with their unusual practices in spite of the misgivings of many AA members. In their house they had a &quot;spook room&quot; where they would invite guests to participate in séances using a Ouija board.

==Legacy==
In 2021, Alcoholics Anonymous reported having over 120,000 registered local groups and over 1.9million active members worldwide.

Wilson has often been described as having loved being the center of attention, but after the AA principle of anonymity had become established, he refused an honorary degree from Yale University and refused to allow his picture, even from the back, on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s persistence, his ability to take and use good ideas, and his entrepreneurial flair are revealed in his pioneering escape from an alcoholic &quot;death sentence&quot;, his central role in the development of a program of spiritual growth, and his leadership in creating and building AA, &quot;an independent, entrepreneurial, maddeningly democratic, non-profit organization&quot;.

Wilson is perhaps best known as a synthesizer of ideas, the man who pulled together various threads of psychology, theology, and democracy into a workable and life-saving system. Aldous Huxley called him &quot;the greatest social architect of our century&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Wilson to their &quot;&quot;Time&quot; 100 List of The Most Important People of the 20th Century&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s self-description was a man who, &quot;because of his bitter experience, discovered, slowly and through a conversion experience, a system of behavior and a series of actions that work for alcoholics who want to stop drinking.&quot;

Biographer Susan Cheever wrote in &quot;My Name Is Bill&quot;, &quot;Bill Wilson never held himself up as a model: he only hoped to help other people by sharing his own experience, strength and hope. He insisted again and again that he was just an ordinary man&quot;.

Wilson bought a house that he and Lois called Stepping Stones on an estate in Katonah, New York, in 1941, and he lived there with Lois until he died in 1971. After Lois died in 1988, the house was opened for tours and is now on the National Register of Historic Places; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012.

==In popular culture==
Wilson, his wife Lois, and the formation of AA, have been the subject of numerous projects, including &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;, a 1989 CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie starring James Woods as Bill W. and James Garner as Bob Smith. Woods won an Emmy for his portrayal of Wilson. He was depicted in a 2010 TV movie based on Lois&#x27; life, &quot;When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story&quot;, adapted from a 2005 book of the same name written by William G. Borchert. The film starred Winona Ryder as Lois Wilson and Barry Pepper as Bill W. A 2012 documentary, &quot;Bill W.&quot;, was directed by Dan Carracino and Kevin Hanlon.

The band El Ten Eleven&#x27;s song &quot;Thanks Bill&quot; is dedicated to Bill W. since lead singer Kristian Dunn&#x27;s wife got sober due to AA. He states &quot;If she hadn&#x27;t gotten sober we probably wouldn&#x27;t be together, so that&#x27;s my thank you to Bill Wilson who invented AA&quot;. In Michael Graubart&#x27;s &quot;Sober Songs Vol. 1&quot;, the song &quot;Hey, Hey, AA&quot; references Bill&#x27;s encounter with Ebby Thatcher which started him on the path to recovery and eventually the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous. The lyric reads, &quot;Ebby T. comes strolling in. Bill says, &#x27;Fine, you&#x27;re a friend of mine. Don&#x27;t mind if I drink my gin.

<text>The Twelve Traditions of twelve-step programs provide guidelines for relationships between the twelve-step groups, members, other groups, the global fellowship, and society at large. Questions of finance, public relations, donations, and purpose are addressed in the traditions. They were originally written by Bill Wilson after the founding of the first twelve-step group, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).

==Origins==
Several of the tenets of what was to become AA&#x27;s Twelve Traditions were first expressed in the foreword to the first edition of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939. By 1944 the number of AA groups had grown, along with the number of letters being sent to the AA headquarters in New York asking how to handle disputes caused by issues like publicity, religion, and finances. By 1946 AA cofounder Bill Wilson had formulated the basic ideas for the Twelve Traditions based on this correspondence with groups (via the group conscience method), setting guidelines on how groups and members should interact with each other, the public, and AA as a whole. The traditions were first published in the April 1946 AA Grapevine under the title &quot;Twelve Points to Assure Our Future&quot; and were formally adopted at AA&#x27;s first international convention in 1950. Wilson&#x27;s book on the subject, &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;, was published in April 1953.

==The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous==
#Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.
#For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority — a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.
#The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.
#Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole.
#Each group has but one primary purpose — to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.
#An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.
#Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
#Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.
#A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.
#Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.
#Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.
#Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

===Long Form===
Our A.A. experience has taught us that:

#Each member of Alcoholics Anonymous is but a small part of a great whole. A.A. must continue to live or most of us will surely die. Hence our common welfare comes first. But individual welfare follows close afterward.
#For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority — a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience.
#Our membership ought to include all who suffer from alcoholism. Hence we may refuse none who wish to recover. Nor ought A.A. membership ever depend upon money or conformity. Any two or three alcoholics gathered together for sobriety may call themselves an A.A. group, provided that, as a group, they have no other affiliation.
#With respect to its own affairs, each A.A. group should be responsible to no other authority than its own conscience. But when its plans concern the welfare of neighboring groups also, those groups ought to be consulted. And no group, regional committee, or individual should ever take any action that might greatly affect A.A. as a whole without conferring with the trustees of the General Service Board. On such issues our common welfare is paramount.
#Each Alcoholics Anonymous group ought to be a spiritual entity having but one primary purpose — that of carrying its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.
#Problems of money, property, and authority may easily divert us from our primary spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable property of genuine use to A.A. should be separately incorporated and managed, thus dividing the material from the spiritual. An A.A. group, as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids to A.A., such as clubs or hospitals which require much property or administration, ought to be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to use the A.A. name. Their management should be the sole responsibility of those people who financially support them. For clubs, A.A. managers are usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as other places of recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A. — and medically supervised. While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought never go so far as affiliation or endorsement, actual or implied. An A.A. group can bind itself to no one.
#The A.A. groups themselves ought to be fully supported by the voluntary contributions of their own members. We think that each group should soon achieve this ideal; that any public solicitation of funds using the name of Alcoholics Anonymous is highly dangerous, whether by groups, clubs, hospitals, or other outside agencies; that acceptance of large gifts from any source, or of contributions carrying any obligation whatever, is unwise. Then too, we view with much concern those A.A. treasuries which continue, beyond prudent reserves, to accumulate funds for no stated A.A. purpose. Experience has often warned us that nothing can so surely destroy our spiritual heritage as futile disputes over property, money, and authority.
#Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional. We define professionalism as the occupation of counseling alcoholics for fees or hire. But we may employ alcoholics where they are going to perform those services for which we may otherwise have to engage nonalcoholics. Such special services may be well recompensed. But our usual A.A. &quot;12 Step&quot; work is never to be paid for.
#Each A.A. group needs the least possible organization. Rotating leadership is the best. The small group may elect its secretary, the large group its rotating committee, and the groups of a large metropolitan area their central or intergroup committee, which often employs a full-time secretary. The trustees of the General Service Board are, in effect, our A.A. General Service Committee. They are the custodians of our A.A. Tradition and the receivers of voluntary A.A. contributions by which we maintain our A.A. General Service Office at New York. They are authorized by the groups to handle our over-all public relations and they guarantee the integrity of our principal newspaper, the A.A. Grapevine. All such representatives are to be guided in the spirit of service, for true leaders in A.A. are but trusted and experienced servants of the whole. They derive no real authority from their titles; they do not govern. Universal respect is the key to their usefulness.
#No A.A. group or member should ever, in such a way as to implicate A.A., express any opinion on outside controversial issues — particularly those of politics, alcohol reform, or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics Anonymous groups oppose no one. Concerning such matters they can express no views whatever.
#Our relations with the general public should be characterized by personal anonymity. We think A.A. ought to avoid sensational advertising. Our names and pictures as A.A. members ought not be broadcast, filmed, or publicly printed. Our public relations should be guided by the principle of attraction rather than promotion. There is never need to praise ourselves. We feel it better to let our friends recommend us.
#And finally, we of Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the principle of anonymity has an immense spiritual significance. It reminds us that we are to place principles before personalities; that we are actually to practice a genuine humility. This to the end that our great blessings may never spoil us; that we shall forever live in thankful contemplation of Him who presides over us all.

==The Traditions in other twelve-step programs==
Other twelve-step programs make small changes to the original Twelve Traditions used in Alcoholics Anonymous and offer interpretations specific to their programs. The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), the second largest twelve-step program, are as stated in the above (short form only) with all instances of AA replaced with NA, the word alcoholic replaced with the word addiction, and the word drinking replaced with the word using. NA published their &quot;It Works: How and Why&quot; as its own study of the Twelve Traditions.

Marijuana Anonymous has made similar changes to adapt the traditions to marijuana use, and has gone a step further by eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. This parallels the wording of MA&#x27;s Twelve Steps. The MA Steps and Traditions are listed and expanded upon in MA&#x27;s text, &quot;Life With Hope&quot;.

==Singleness of purpose== 
AA&#x27;s Singleness of Purpose is a principle derived from the Fifth Tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous, &quot;Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.&quot; Other groups replace the word alcoholic with the identifying characteristic of their fellowship, or otherwise rephrase it to have a similar meaning. For instance, in Marijuana Anonymous that member would be a marijuana addict, while in Narcotics Anonymous that member would be an addict. The principle is based on the philosophy that those that share common physical cravings and mental obsessions can best understand and help those that are struggling with their specific addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson wrote in the February 1958 AA Grapevine that

<text>African art describes modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual cultures from native or indigenous Africans and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the African diasporas, such as art in African-American, Caribbean or South American societies inspired by African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.

Pottery, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, textile art, and fiber art are important visual art forms across Africa and may be included in the study of African art. The term &quot;African Art&quot; does not usually include the art of the North African areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art, with many particular local characteristics. Islamic art is very important in their culture, showing the past and backstory of their culture

Ethiopian art, with a longstanding Christian tradition, is also different from that of most African art, where Traditional African religion (with Islam prevalent in the north) was dominant until the 20th century. African art includes prehistoric and ancient art, the Islamic art of West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the traditional artifacts of these, and other regions. Many African sculptures were historically made of wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago, although rare older pottery and metal figures can be found in some areas. Some of the earliest decorative objects, such as shell beads and evidence of paint, have been discovered in Africa, dating to the Middle Stone Age. Masks are important elements in the art of many people, along with human figures, and are often highly stylized. There are a wide variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin and depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent. Sculpture is most common among &quot;groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers&quot; in West Africa. Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for ritual ceremonies. Since the late 19th century, there has been an increasing amount of African art in Western collections, the finest pieces of which are displayed as part of the history of colonization.

African art had an important influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their interest in abstract depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of &quot;African art&quot;, as seen by European and American artists and art historians.

West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous Benin Bronzes, to decorate palaces and for highly naturalistic royal heads from around the Bini town of Benin City, Edo State, as well as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan gold weights are a form of small metal sculptures produced from 1400–1900; some represent proverbs, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included gold sculptured elements. Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots. 

== Thematic elements ==
* In Western African art, there is a focus on being expressive and unique while still being influenced by the art of those who came before. The art of the Dan people is an example of this, and it has also spread to Western African communities outside of the continent.
*Emphasis on the human figure: The human figure has always been the primary subject matter for most African art, and this emphasis even influenced certain European traditions. For example, in the fifteenth century, Portugal traded with the Sapi culture near the Ivory Coast in West Africa, who created elaborate ivory salt cellars that were hybrids of African and European designs, most notably in the addition of the human figure (the human figure typically did not appear in Portuguese saltcellars). The human figure may symbolize the living or the dead, reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades or even be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive functions. Another common theme is the intermorphosis of humans and animals.
*Visual abstraction: African artworks tend to favor visual abstraction over naturalistic representation. This is because many African artworks generalize stylistic norms.

== Scope ==
The study of African art until recently focused on the traditional art of certain well-known groups on the continent, with a particular emphasis on traditional sculpture, masks and other visual culture from non-Islamic West Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa with a particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Recently, however, there has been a movement among African art historians and other scholars to include the visual culture of other regions and time periods. The notion is that by including all African cultures and their visual culture over time in &quot;African art&quot;, there will be a greater understanding of the continent&#x27;s visual aesthetics across time. Finally, the arts of the African diaspora, in Brazil, the Caribbean and the south-eastern United States, have also begun to be included in the study of African art.

== Materials ==

African art is produced using a wide range of materials and takes many distinct shapes. Because wood is a prevalent material, wood sculptures make up the majority of African art. Other materials used in creating African art include clay soil. Jewelry is a popular art form used to indicate rank, affiliation with a group, or purely aesthetics. African jewelry is made from such diverse materials as Tiger&#x27;s eye stone, Hematite, Sisal, coconut shell, beads and Ebony wood. Sculptures can be wooden, ceramic or carved out of stone like the famous Shona sculptures, and decorated or sculpted pottery comes from many regions. Various forms of textiles are made including Kitenge, mud cloth and Kente cloth. Mosaics made of butterfly wings or colored sand are popular in West Africa. Early African sculptures can be identified as being made of terracotta and bronze.

== Black Art Institutions and Recognition ==
The increasing recognition of Black American art has led to the establishment of institutions dedicated to preserving and showcasing this legacy. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and The Studio Museum in Harlem are just two examples of spaces where Black art is celebrated. Additionally, major museums and galleries across the country are increasingly featuring exhibitions that highlight the contributions of Black artists.

== Traditional African religions == 

Traditional African religions have significantly shaped the art forms and cultural expressions across the African continent. These religions often emphasize the connection between the spiritual and material worlds, resulting in art that serves a functional and symbolic role. 

Artworks created within these traditions frequently embody religious symbolism, utilitarianism, and functionality. For instance, masks, sculptures, and figurines are often integral to rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual practices, symbolizing ancestral spirits, deities, or cosmic forces. 

One central theme is the veneration of ancestors, who are viewed as intermediaries between the living and the divine. Ancestor worship inspires the creation of ritualistic objects, such as carved statues, ceremonial masks, and sacred relics, used to honor and communicate with these spiritual entities. For example, the Baule and Dogon peoples produce highly detailed figurines and masks for rituals aimed at ensuring communal well-being. 

Traditional African art also serves as a means of depicting deities and natural forces. Gods such as Ogun, the deity of iron, war, and craftsmanship in Yoruba religion, are often represented through sculptures or tools imbued with symbolic power. 

The influence of external religions, particularly Christianity and Islam, has also left a lasting imprint on African art. Over centuries, elements of these faiths have been integrated into traditional religious practices, resulting in syncretic artworks that blend indigenous and foreign iconography. For example, Islamic geometric patterns have influenced West African textiles, while Christian symbolism appears in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church’s illuminated manuscripts and murals. 

Art in traditional African religions remains a living expression of cultural heritage, spiritual beliefs, and societal values, continuing to evolve alongside contemporary influences.

== History ==

The origins of African art lie long before the recorded history. The region&#x27;s oldest known beads were made from &quot;Nassarius&quot; shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago. In Africa, evidence for the making of paints by a complex process exists from about 100,000 years ago and of the use of pigments from around 320,000 years ago. African rock art in the Sahara in Niger preserves 6000-year-old carvings. Along with sub-Saharan Africa, the Western cultural arts, ancient Egyptian paintings and artifacts, and indigenous southern crafts also contributed greatly to African art. The abundance of surrounding nature was often depicted through abstract interpretations of animals, plant life, or natural designs and shapes. The Nubian Kingdom of Kush in modern Sudan was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt and produced monumental sculptures mostly derivative of styles that did not lead to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the Nok culture, which thrived between 1,500 BC and 500 AD in modern Nigeria. Its clay figures typically feature elongated bodies and angular shapes.
More complex methods of producing art were developed in sub-Saharan Africa around the 10th century, some of the most notable advancements include the bronze work of Igbo Ukwu and the terracotta and metalworks of Ile Ife Bronze and brass castings, often ornamented with ivory and precious stones, became highly prestigious in much of West Africa, sometimes being limited to the work of court artisans and identified with royalty, as with the Benin Bronzes.

As Europeans explored the coasts of West Africa, they discovered a wide range of functional objects that Africans used for cultural, social, and economic purposes. Oath devices, for instance, were essential to securing business relationships during the era of the Atlantic slave trade. Though these works of craftsmanship followed their own aesthetic principles, they were regarded as tools of sorcery by European travel writers and reduced to a category of &quot;fetish,&quot; which was understood to be outside the realm of art.

== Influence on Western art ==
During and after the 19th and 20th-century colonial period, Westerners long characterized African art as &quot;primitive.&quot; The term carries with it negative connotations of underdevelopment and poverty. Colonization during the nineteenth century set up a Western understanding hinged on the belief that African art lacked technical ability due to its low socioeconomic status.

At the start of the twentieth century, art historians like Carl Einstein, Michał Sobeski and Leo Frobenius published important works about the theme, giving African art the status of an aesthetic object, not only of an ethnographic object. At the same time, artists like Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Henri Matisse, Joseph Csaky, and Amedeo Modigliani became aware of and inspired by, African art, amongst other art forms. In a situation where the established avant-garde was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African art demonstrated the power of supremely well-organized forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a formal perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power. The study of and response to African art, by artists at the beginning of the twentieth century facilitated an explosion of interest in the abstraction, organization, and reorganization of forms, and the exploration of emotional and psychological areas hitherto unseen in Western art. By these means, the status of visual art was changed. Art ceased to be merely and primarily aesthetic, but became also a true medium for philosophic and intellectual discourse, and hence more truly and profoundly aesthetic than ever before.

* Abstraction and Form: African sculptures and masks showcased a departure from literal representation, emphasizing geometric forms and symbolic proportions, which inspired movements like Cubism and Fauvism.
* Emotional and Psychological Depth: The expressive power of African art encouraged modernist artists to explore raw emotion, spirituality, and the subconscious.
* Philosophical and Intellectual Discourse: The integration of African aesthetics transformed art from mere representation to a medium for exploring profound ideas, redefining the role of visual art in intellectual and cultural contexts.

== Traditional art ==

Traditional art describes the most popular and studied forms of African art typically found in museum collections.

Wooden masks, which might either be of human, animal or legendary creatures, are one of the most commonly found forms of art in Western Africa. In their original contexts, ceremonial masks are used for celebrations, initiations, crop harvesting, and war preparation. The masks are worn by a chosen or initiated dancer. During the mask ceremony the dancer goes into a deep trance, and during this state of mind he &quot;communicates&quot; with his ancestors. The masks can be worn in three different ways: vertically covering the face: as helmets, encasing the entire head, and as a crest, resting upon the head, which was commonly covered by material as part of the disguise. African masks often represent a spirit and it is strongly believed that the spirit of the ancestors possesses the wearer. Most African masks are made with wood, and can be decorated with: Ivory, animal hair, plant fibers (such as raffia), pigments (like kaolin), stones, and semi-precious gems also are included in the masks.

Statues, usually of wood or ivory, are often inlaid with cowrie shells, metal studs and nails. Decorative clothing is also commonplace and comprises another large part of African art. Among the most complex of African textiles is the colorful, strip-woven Kente cloth of Ghana. Boldly patterned mudcloth is another well-known technique.

== Black American Art: A Legacy Found in America ==
Black American art holds a significant place in the cultural tapestry of the United States, serving as a testament to the resilience, creativity, and depth of the Black experience. This artistic heritage spans centuries, encompassing various mediums, movements, and messages that reflect the complex history and evolving identity of African Americans. From the earliest expressions in enslaved communities to contemporary works celebrated in galleries and museums, Black American art continues to shape and redefine the cultural narrative of America.

== The Harlem Renaissance: A Cultural Awakening ==
The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s marked a pivotal moment in Black American art. Centered in Harlem, New York, this movement celebrated African American identity, history, and culture. Visual artists like Aaron Douglas, Jacob Lawrence, and Augusta Savage produced works that captured the vibrancy of Black life and the struggles for equality. Their art often drew on themes from African heritage, jazz, and the realities of segregation, creating pieces that were both politically charged and aesthetically innovative.

Augusta Savage, a sculptor, is particularly renowned for her work “The Harp,” created for the 1939 New York World’s Fair. The piece, inspired by the song “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” became a symbol of pride and resilience. Similarly, Jacob Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Migration Series&quot; documented the Great Migration, telling the story of millions of African Americans who moved from the rural South to urban centers in the North in search of better opportunities.

== Contemporary Black American Art ==
Today, Black American art continues to thrive, breaking boundaries and addressing new challenges. Artists like Kara Walker, Kehinde Wiley, and Amy Sherald have gained international acclaim for their groundbreaking work. Kara Walker’s silhouettes confront the brutal realities of slavery, challenging viewers to grapple with America’s historical legacy. Known for their vibrant portraits, Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald gained widespread recognition when they received commissions to paint the official portraits of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, respectively.

These contemporary artists, among many others, engage with themes of identity, power, and representation, creating works that resonate with audiences across the globe.

== Black Art Institutions and Recognition ==
The increasing recognition of Black American art has led to establishing institutions dedicated to preserving and showcasing this legacy. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and The Studio Museum in Harlem are just two examples of spaces where Black art is celebrated. Additionally, major museums and galleries across the country are increasingly featuring exhibitions highlighting Black artists&#x27; contributions.

== Contemporary African art ==

Africa is home to a thriving contemporary art and fine art culture. This has been under-studied until recently, due to scholars&#x27; and art collectors&#x27; emphasis on traditional art. Notable modern artists include El Anatsui, Marlene Dumas, William Kentridge, Karel Nel, Kendell Geers, Yinka Shonibare, Zerihun Yetmgeta, Odhiambo Siangla, Elias Jengo, Olu Oguibe, Lubaina Himid, Bili Bidjocka and Henry Tayali. Art s are held in Dakar, Senegal, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art auctions. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have a difficult time finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American Cubist and totemic artists, such as Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse, who, in the early twentieth century, were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This period was critical to the evolution of Western modernism in visual arts, symbolized by Picasso&#x27;s breakthrough painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;.

Today, Fathi Hassan is considered a major early representative of contemporary black African art. Contemporary African art was pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s in South Africa by artists like Irma Stern, Cyril Fradan, and Walter Battiss and through galleries like the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg. More recently European galleries such as the October Gallery in London and collectors such as Jean Pigozzi, Artur Walther and Gianni Baiocchi in Rome have helped expand the interest in the subject. Numerous exhibitions at the Museum for African Art in New York and the African Pavilion at the 2007 Venice Biennale, which showcased the Sindika Dokolo African

Collection of Contemporary Art has gone a long way to counter many of the myths and prejudices that haunt Contemporary African Art. The appointment of Nigerian Okwui Enwezor as artistic director of Documenta 11 and his African-centred vision of art propelled the careers of countless African artists onto the international stage.
A wide range of more-or-less traditional forms of art or adaptations of traditional style to contemporary taste is made for sale to tourists and others, including so-called &quot;airport art&quot;. Several vigorous popular traditions assimilate Western influences into African styles such as the elaborate fantasy coffins of Southern Ghana, made in a variety of different shapes which represent the occupations or interests of the deceased or elevate their status. The Ga believe that an elaborate funeral will benefit the status of their loved ones in the afterlife, so families often spare no expense when deciding which coffin they want for their relatives. These coffins can take the forms of cars, cocoa pods, chickens, or any other shape a family may decide best represents their deceased loved one.

=== Pop art and advertising art ===
Art used to advertise for local businesses, including barbershops, movie houses, and appliance stores has become internationally celebrated in galleries and has launched the careers of many contemporary African artists, from Joseph Bertiers of Kenya to several movie poster painters in Ghana. Ghanaian hand-painted movie posters on canvas and flour sacks from the 1980s and 1990s have been exhibited at museums around the world and sparked viral social media attention due to their highly imaginative and stylized depictions of Western films. This creative interpretation of Western culture through African art styles is also on display with the tradition of praise portraits depicting international celebrities, which often served as storefront advertising art, and have since become widely valued and collected in the global art market.

=== Minimalist African art ===
Another notable contemporary African artist is Amir Nour, a Sudanese artist who lived in Chicago. In the 1960s he created a metal sculpture called &quot;Grazing at Shendi (1969)&quot; which consists of geometric shapes that connect with his memory of his homeland. The sculpture resembles grazing sheep in the distance. He valued discovering art within the society of the artist, including culture, tradition, and background.

== By country, civilizations or people ==
=== West Africa ===
==== Ghana ====

In the 17th century, the area in West Africa, now known as Ghana, was highly prolific. The states that belonged to Ghana were connected through trading networks and shared cultural beliefs. However, each of them decided to remain politically independent. This was until the early 18th century, when leader Osei Tutu began a vast land expansion that unified these smaller states. 

The kingdom’s involvement in gold, cloth, and slave trades was not just significant, but it also generated immense wealth. This economic power upheld a flourishing artistic culture, making the kingdom a hub of cultural and economic activity.

Ghana is most famous for creating the most famous African expressions and works. These works range from wood carvings to brass works, figures, and even gems.

A Kente is a traditional, multi-colored, hand-woven, quilted cloth. It is also a sort of silk and cotton texture made of interlaced cloth strips. The cloth is central to the Ghanaian culture and it is also traditionally used to be worn as a wrap-around for both men and women with slightly different variations for both of them. This fabric is worn by almost every Ghanaian tribe member.

;Colors And Meaning

There are different color variations for the Kente, each color has different meanings. Here are some examples:

Black: maturation

White: purification

Yellow: preciousness

Blue: peacefulness

Red: bloodshed


Akan art originated among the Akan people. Akan art is known for its vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculptures, Akan gold weights, as well as gold and silver jewelry. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values gold above all other metals and believes that it can portray the supernatural elements behind many things, including royal authority and cultural values. The Asante, a dominant Akan-speaking culture in Ghana, trace their origins back to the arrival of a golden stool, which is now said to hold the soul of the Asante nation within it. Gold was considered an earthly counterpart to the sun and was often utilized in art to display the importance of the king, making it an essential representation of their cultural and social values. Kente cloth is another extremely important art tradition of Akan culture. Tradition states that Kente cloth originated as weavers tried to copy the weaving abilities of spiders with their webs. Kente cloth is world renowned for its colors and patterns. Its original purpose was to portray royal power and authority, but has now become a symbol of tradition and has been adopted by several other cultures.


==== Nigeria ====
Nigerian culture is illustrated through art and folklore. Nigeria draws its inspiration for their art from the traditional folk heritage of the region. There are different types of artwork from the Nigerian culture. Some of these works of art can be stone carvings, potteries, glasswork, wood carvings and bronze works. Benin and Awka are considered to be the central places for wood carving. Woodcarvers have been thriving throughout the south of Nigeria from time immemorial.
Examples of Nigerian Traditional Art

Masks

Masks are a piece of the animist confidence of the Yoruba individuals. The veils are painted, and fans wear them at memorial services and different functions to mollify the spirits.

Pottery

Pottery has a long custom in Nigeria. Pottery was well known from 100 B.C. These days Suleja, Abuja and Ilorin are viewed as significant figures of customary ceramics. Potters in Nigeria are frequently female and usually practice for the methods to be passed on through families.

Textiles

Yorubas utilize a bush to make indigo-shaded batik-colored fabric. Ladies generally do the withering, while in the north, the specialty is drilled only by men. Weavers everywhere throughout the nation produce a splendid texture with ribbon structures. Oyo state is known for its fine loom materials while fabric from Abia state utilizes a broadloom strategy.
The Nok culture is an early Iron Age population whose material remains are named after the Ham village of Nok in Kaduna State of Nigeria, where their famous terracotta sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in northern Nigeria around 1500 BC and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, thus having lasted approximately 2,000 years.

The function of Nok terracotta sculptures remains unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is best known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from alluvial mud, in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued in the international art market. The terracotta figures are hollow, coil-built, nearly life-sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant jewelry, and varied postures.

Little is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, grave markers, and charms to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures. Margaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in The Cleveland Museum of Art, explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.

As a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Two archaeological sites, Samun Dukiya and Taruga, were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. Radiocarbon and thermo-luminescence tests narrowed the sculptures’ age down to between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.

Because of the similarities between the two sites, archaeologist Graham Connah believes that &quot;Nok artwork represents a style that was adopted by a range of iron-using farming societies of varying cultures, rather than being the diagnostic feature of a particular human group as has often been claimed.&quot;

===== Benin art =====
Benin art is the art from the Kingdom of Benin or Edo Empire (1440–1897), a pre-colonial African state located in what is now known as the South-South region of Nigeria. The Benin Bronzes are a group of more than a thousand metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in what is now modern-day Nigeria. Collectively, the objects form the best-known examples of Benin art, created from the thirteenth century onwards, by the Edo people, which also included other sculptures in brass or bronze, including some famous portrait heads and smaller pieces.

In 1897 most of the plaques and other objects in the collection were taken by a British force during the Benin Expedition of 1897, which took place as British control in Southern Nigeria was being consolidated. Two hundred of the pieces were taken to the British Museum, while the rest were purchased by other museums in Europe. Today, a large number are held by the British Museum, as well as by other notable collections in German and American museums.

===== Igbo =====

The Igbo produce a wide variety of art, including traditional figures, masks, artifacts and textiles, plus works in metals such as bronze. Artworks from the Igbo have been found from as early as the 9th century with the bronze artifacts found at Igbo Ukwu. Their masks are similar to the Fang ones, as they share a combination of white and black colors in roughly the same areas.
===== Yoruba =====

Yoruba art is best known for the heads from Ife, made from ceramic, brass and other materials. Much of their art is associated with the royal courts. They also produced elaborate masks and doors, full of details and painted in bright colors, such as blue, yellow, red and white.

===== Other ethnic groups of Nigeria =====
==== Mali ====

The primary ethnic groups in Mali are the Bambara (also known as Bamana) and the Dogon. Smaller ethnic groups consist of the Marka, and the Bozo fisherman of the Niger River. Ancient civilizations flourished in areas like Djene and Timbuktu, where a great variety of ancient bronze and terracotta figures have been unearthed.

===== Djenné-Djenno =====

Djenné-Djenno is famous for its figurines which depict humans and animals including snakes and horses. They are made of terracotta, a material that has been used in West Africa for some ten thousand years.

===== Bambara =====

The Bambara people () adapted many artistic traditions and began to create display pieces. Before money was the main drive for creation of their artworks they used their abilities solely as a sacred craft for display of spiritual pride, religious beliefs and display of customs. Example artworks include the Bamana n&#x27;tomo mask. Other statues were created for people such as hunters and farmers so others could leave offerings after long farming seasons or group hunts. The stylistic variations in Bambara art are extreme sculptures, masks and headdresses that display either stylized or realistic features, and either weathered or encrusted patinas. Until quite recently, the function of Bambara pieces was shrouded in mystery, but in the last twenty years, field studies have revealed that certain types of figures and headdresses were associated with a number of the societies that structure Bambara life. During the 1970s a group of approximately twenty figures, masks and TjiWara headdresses belonging to the so-called &#x27;Segou style&#x27; were identified. The style is distinct and recognizable by its typical flat faces, arrow-shaped noses, all-over body triangular scarifications and, on the figures, splayed hands.

;Masks
There are three major and one minor type of Bambara mask. The first type, used by the N&#x27;tomo society, has a typical comb-like structure above the face, is worn during dances and may be covered with cowrie shells. The second type of mask, associated with the Komo society, has a spherical head with two antelope horns on the top and an enlarged, flattened mouth. They are used during dances, but some have a thickly encrusted patina acquired during other ceremonies in which libations are poured over them.

The third type has connections with the Nama society and is carved in the form of an articulated bird&#x27;s head, while the fourth, minor type, represents a stylized animal head and is used by the Kore society. Other Bambara masks are known to exist, but unlike those described above, they cannot be linked to specific societies or ceremonies. Bambara carvers have established a reputation for the zoomorphic headdresses worn by Tji-Wara society members. Although they are all different, they all display a highly abstract body, often incorporating a zig-zag motif, which represents the sun&#x27;s course from east to west, and a head with two large horns. Bambara members of the Tji-Wara society wear the headdress while dancing in their fields at sowing time, hoping to increase the crop yield.

;Statuettes
Statuettes are a cornerstone of African art, embodying the continent&#x27;s deep cultural, spiritual, and social values. These small, often intricately crafted sculptures transcend mere decorative purposes, serving as powerful symbols of identity, ritual, and community. Found across diverse African regions, statuettes vary widely in style, material, and function but share a common thread of storytelling and cultural significance.

* Spiritual Significance: Many African statuettes are created to honor ancestors, deities, or spirits. They are often used in religious ceremonies or placed in shrines to serve as intermediaries between the human and spiritual worlds. For example, the Bakongo Nkisi figures from Central Africa are believed to harness spiritual energy for protection, healing, or justice.
* Representation of Life Stages and Roles: Statuettes often depict key aspects of human life, such as fertility, motherhood, initiation, and leadership. The Akua’ba fertility dolls of the Akan people in Ghana symbolize the hope for healthy children, while sculptures of chiefs or elders reflect authority and wisdom.

Other Bambara figures, called Dyonyeni, are thought to be associated with either the southern Dyo society or the Kwore society. These female or hermaphrodite figures usually appear with geometric features such as large conical breasts and measure between 40 and 85 cm in height. The blacksmith members of the Dyo society used them during dances to celebrate the end of their initiation ceremonies. They were handled, held by dancers and placed in the middle of the ceremonial circle.

Among the corpus of Bambara figures, Boh sculptures are perhaps the best known. These statues represent a highly stylized animal or human figure, and are made of wood which is repeatedly covered in thick layers of earth impregnated with sacrificial materials such as millet, chicken or goat blood, kola nuts and alcoholic drinks. They were employed by the Kono and the Komo societies and served as receptacles for spiritual forces, and could, in turn, be used for apotropaic purposes.

Each special creative trait a person obtained was seen as a different way to please higher spirits.

===== Dogon =====
Dogon art consists primarily of sculptures. Their art revolves around Dogon religious values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, sanctuaries, or kept with the Hogon (Laude, 20). The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.

Themes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46–52). Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from Tellem art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).

Dogon art is extremely versatile, although common stylistic characteristics – such as a tendency towards stylization – are apparent on the statues. Their art deals with the myths whose complex ensemble regulates the life of the individual. The sculptures are preserved in innumerable sites of worship, personal or family altars, altars for rain, altars to protect hunters, in market. As a general characterization of Dogon statues, one could say that they render the human body in a simplified way, reducing it to its essentials. Some are extremely elongated with emphasis on geometric forms. The subjective impression is one of immobility with a mysterious sense of solemn gravity and serene majesty, although conveying at the same time a latent movement. Dogon sculpture recreates the hermaphroditic silhouettes of the Tellem, featuring raised arms and a thick patina made of blood and millet beer. The four Nommo couples, the mythical ancestors born of the god Amma, ornament stools, pillars or men&#x27;s meeting houses, door locks, and granary doors. The primordial couple is represented sitting on a stool, the base of which depicts the earth while the upper surface represents the sky; the two are interconnected by the Nommo. The seated female figures, their hands on their abdomen, are linked to the fertility cult, incarnating the first ancestor who died in childbirth, and are the object of offerings of food and sacrifices by women who are expecting a child.

Kneeling statues of protective spirits are placed at the head of the dead to absorb their spiritual strength and to be their intermediaries with the world of the dead, into which they accompany the deceased before once again being placed on the shrines of the ancestors. Horsemen are reminders of the fact that, according to myth, the horse was the first animal present on earth. The Dogon style has evolved into a kind of cubism: ovoid head, squared shoulders, tapered extremities, pointed breasts, forearms, and thighs on a parallel plane, hairdos stylized by three or four incised lines. Dogon sculptures serve as a physical medium in initiations and as an explanation of the world. They serve to transmit an understanding to the initiated, who will decipher the statue according to the level of their knowledge. Carved animal figures, such as dogs and ostriches, are placed on village foundation altars to commemorate sacrificed animals, while granary doors, stools and house posts are also adorned with figures and symbols.

There are nearly eighty styles of masks, but their basic characteristic is great boldness in the use of geometric shapes, independent of the various animals they are supposed to represent. The structure of a large number of masks is based on the interplay of vertical and horizontal lines and shapes. Another large group has triangular, conic shapes. All masks have large geometric eyes and stylized features. The masks are often polychrome, but on many, the color is lost; after the ceremonies, they were left on the ground and quickly deteriorated because of termites and other conditions. The Dogon continue an ancient masquerading tradition, which commemorates the origin of death. According to their myths, death came into the world as a result of primeval man&#x27;s transgressions against the divine order. Dama memorial ceremonies are held to accompany the dead into the ancestral realm and restore order to the universe. The performance of masqueraders – sometimes as many as 400 – at these ceremonies is considered necessary. In the case of the dama, the timing, types of masks involved, and other ritual elements are often specific to one or two villages and may not resemble those seen in locations only several kilometres distant. The masks also appear during baga-bundo rites performed by small numbers of masqueraders before the burial of a male Dogon. Dogon masks evoke the form of animals associated with their mythology, yet their significance is only understood by the highest ranking cult members whose role is to explain the meaning of each mask to a captivated audience.

===== Other ethnic groups of Mali =====
==== Burkina Faso ====

Burkina Faso is a small, landlocked country north of Ghana and south of Mali and Niger. Economically, it is one of the four or five poorest countries worldwide. Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part, this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian. Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits and the spirits of nature. In great part, they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso have become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast, many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.

One of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, has been confusion between the styles of the Bwa, &quot;gurunsi&quot;, and Mossi, and confusion of the Bwa people with their neighbors to the west the Bobo people. This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula interpreters at the turn of the century. these interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as &quot;Bobo-Fing&quot; and to the Bwa as &quot;Bobo-Oule.&quot; In fact, these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages and social systems are quite different, and so is their art. In terms of artistic styles, the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, &quot;gurunsi&#x27;&quot; and Mossi make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, and also includes the Dogon and other peoples who speak Voltaic languages.

==== Ivory Coast (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) ====
The Baoulé, the Senoufo and the Dan peoples are skilled at carving wood and each culture produces wooden masks in wide variety. The Ivorian people use masks to represent animals in caricature to depict deities, or to represent the souls of the departed.

As the masks are held to be of great spiritual power, it is considered taboo for anyone other than specially trained persons or chosen ones to wear or possess certain masks. These ceremonial masks are each thought to have a soul, or life force, and wearing these masks is thought to transform the wearer into the entity the mask represents.

Ivory Coast (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) also has modern painters and illustrators. Gilbert G. Groud criticizes the ancient beliefs in black magic, as held with the spiritual masks mentioned above, in his illustrated book &quot;Magie Noire&quot;.

=== East Africa ===

East Africa, a region encompassing countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Ethiopia, boasts a rich and diverse artistic heritage. From traditional crafts to contemporary expressions, East African art reflects the region’s vibrant history, cultural complexity, and evolving identity in the global arena.

==== Kenya ====

Around Lake Turkana exist ancient petroglyphs depicting human figures and animals. Bantu tribes build funeral posts and carvings of human heads atop geometric designs are still created. Though the original posts no longer exist, these more recent creations are thought to be a continuation of the practice. The Kikuyu people also continue the designs of ancient tradition in the designs painted on their shields.

Bantu contemporary Kenyan artists include Elimo Njau, founder of the Paa Ya Paa Art Centre, a Nairobi-based artists workshop. From the University of Nairobi School of Fine Art and Design came Bulinya Martins and Sarah Shiundu. The two, by having learned many basic techniques in design, are highly innovative both in style, use of color and execution. Unlike most contemporary Kenyan artists, they paint using oils, acrylics and watercolors and/or combinations.

The Eskenazi Museum of Art at Indiana University has a large collection of traditional art objects from Kenya including jewelry, containers, weapons, walking sticks, headrests, stools, utensils, and other objects available online.

==== Ethiopia ====
Ethiopian art from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of Christian art, mostly for churches, in forms including painting, crosses, icons, illuminated manuscripts, and other metalwork such as crowns. Secondly, there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, basketry and jewellery, in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. Its history goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of D&#x27;mt. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the Coptic Christianity of Egypt, so that Coptic art has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.
Prehistoric rock art comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places and, until the arrival of Christianity, stone stelae, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave markers and for other purposes in many regions; Tiya is one important site. The &quot;pre-Axumite&quot; Iron Age culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the Kingdom of Kush to the north, and settlers from Arabia, and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at Yeha, dating back to the 4th or 5th century BCE.

The powerful Kingdom of Aksum emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century. Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian stelae exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However, the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.

Church paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the introduction of Christianity in the 4th century AD, although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the Tigray Region, dated to the 11th century AD. However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who fled to Axum in temporary exile mentioned that the original Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion was decorated with paintings. Other early paintings include those from the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Genete Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD. However, paintings in illuminated manuscripts predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian Garima Gospels of the 4th–6th centuries AD contain illuminated scenes imitating the contemporary Byzantine style.

Ethiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in icons, is highly distinctive, though the style and iconography are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art. From the 16th century, Roman Catholic church art and European art in general began to exert some influence. However, Ethiopian art is highly conservative and retained much of its distinct character until modern times. The production of illuminated manuscripts for use continued up to the present day.

Another important form of Ethiopian art, also related to Coptic styles, is crosses made from wood and metal. They are usually copper alloy or brass, plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat cast plates with elaborate and complex openwork decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the &quot;arms of Adam&quot;. Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no &quot;corpus,&quot; or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses. Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added. Crosses are mostly either processional crosses, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the liturgy, or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.

Ethiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colorful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article. Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin chiffon-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.

Colorful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of Harar is well known for its high-quality basketry, and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.

==== Tanzania ====
Art from Tanzania is known for paintings by modern artists like Tinga Tinga or George Lilanga, and for traditional as well as modern Makonde sculptures. Like in other regions, there is also a diversified tradition of producing textile art.

Tinga Tinga art has roots in decorating hut walls in central and south Tanzania. It was first in 1968 when Edward Said Tingatinga started to paint on wooden sheets with enamel colours when Tinga Tinga art became known. The art of the Makonde must be subdivided into different areas. The Makonde are known as master carvers throughout East Africa and their statuary can be found being sold in tourist markets and museums alike. They traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. Since the 1950s the so-called Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits (Shetani) that play a special role. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. An outstanding position is taken by George Lilanga.

=== Central Africa ===

==== Democratic Republic of Congo ====

===== Kuba Kingdom =====
The Kuba Kingdom (also rendered as the Kingdom of the Bakuba, Songora or Bushongo) was a pre-colonial kingdom in Central Africa. The Kuba Kingdom flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries in the region bordered by the Sankuru, Lulua, and Kasai rivers in the south-east of the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. A great deal of the art was created for the courts of chiefs and kings and was profusely decorated, incorporating cowrie shells and animal skins (especially leopard) as symbols of wealth, prestige and power. Masks are also important to the Kuba. They are used both in the rituals of the court and in the initiation of boys into adulthood, as well as at funerals.

===== Luba Kingdom =====
The Kingdom of Luba or Luba Empire (1585–1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state that arose in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba Depression in what is now the southern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Today, the Luba people or baLuba are an ethno-linguistic group indigenous to the south-central region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of them live in this country, residing mainly in its Katanga, Kasai, and Maniema provinces.

As in the Kuba Kingdom, the Luba Kingdom held the arts in high esteem. A carver held relatively high status, which was displayed by an adze (axe) that he carried over his shoulder. Luba art was not very uniform because of the vast territory which the kingdom controlled. However, some characteristics are common. The important role of women in the creation myths and political society resulted in many objects of prestige being decorated with female figures.

===== Other ethnic groups of Democratic Republic of Congo =====

==== Chad ====

===== Sao =====

The Sao civilization in Middle Africa from circa the 6th century BC to as late as the 16th century AD, lived by the Chari River around Lake Chad in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad. Their most important artworks are the terracotta figurines. These figurines represent humans and animals. Other kinds of artifacts show that the Saos were skilled workers in bronze, copper, and iron.

==== Gabon ====
The Fang people make masks and basketry, carvings, and sculptures. Fang art is characterized by organized clarity and distinct lines and shapes. Bieri, boxes to hold the remains of ancestors, are carved with protective figures. Masks are worn in ceremonies and for hunting. The faces are painted white with black features. Myene art centers around Myene rituals for death. Female ancestors are represented by white painted masks worn by male relatives. The Bekota use brass and copper to cover their carvings. They use baskets to hold ancestral remains. Tourism is rare in Gabon, and unlike in other African countries, art is not spurred on by commerce.

=== Southern Africa ===
==== Botswana ====
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of Etsha and Gumare are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage; large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

The oldest evidence is ancient paintings from both Botswana and South Africa. Depictions of hunting, both animal and human figures were made by the San people dating before civilization over 20,000 years old within the Kalahari desert.

==== Zimbabwe ====

The culture from Great Zimbabwe is known for buildings and sculptures, including the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds, which appear to have had a special significance and were presumably mounted on monoliths. Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in soapstone have achieved considerable international success. Southern Africa&#x27;s oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.

==== South Africa ====
===== Mapungubwe =====
Kingdom of Mapungubwe (1075–1220) was a pre-colonial state in Southern Africa located at the confluence of the Shashe and Limpopo rivers, south of Great Zimbabwe. The most famous Mapungubwe artwork is a tiny golden rhino, known as the golden rhinoceros of Mapungubwe. In other graves from Mapengubwe were found objects made of iron, gold, copper, ceramic and glass beads.

===== Southern Ndebele =====

The Southern Ndebele people are famous for the way they paint their houses. Distinct geometric forms against stark, contrasting colors form the basis of the Ndebele style, which encompassed everything from the architecture, clothing and tools of the people. While color has almost always had a role in drawing emotions in art, the Ndebele were one of the first Southern African tribes to utilize a wide array of colors to convey specific meanings as part of their very lives.

=== North Africa ===

African art is rarely created for art’s sake; it often carries symbolic meaning related to community values, ancestral reverence, or spiritual beliefs. For example, masks represent spirits or deities, and sculptures can symbolize fertility, protection, or wisdom.

Rock Art and Prehistoric Art:

North Africa&#x27;s artistic heritage dates back to prehistoric times, evidenced by rock art in the Sahara Desert. Sites like Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer in Algeria feature thousands of petroglyphs and paintings, depicting animals, hunting scenes, and daily life from as far back as 10,000 BCE. These works reflect the relationship between early humans and their environment.

==== Egypt ====
Persisting for 3,000 years and thirty dynasties, the &quot;official&quot; art of Ancient Egypt was centered on the state religion of the time. The art ranged from stone carvings of both massive statues and small statuettes to wall art that depicted both history and mythology. In 2600 BC the maturity of Egyptian carving reached a peak it did not reach again for another 1,500 years during the reign of Rameses II.

A lot of the art possesses a certain stiffness, with figures poised upright and rigid in a regal fashion. Bodily proportions also appear to be mathematically derived, giving rise to a sense of fantastic perfection in the figures depicted. This most likely was used to reinforce the godliness of the ruling caste.

==== Nubia and Sudan ====

The people of Nubia, living in southern Egypt and the northern region of Sudan, developed historical art styles similar to that of their Egyptian neighbors to the north. However, Nubian art was not merely a product of colonization by ancient Egypt, but rather due to a mutual exchange of ideas and ideologies along the Nile Valley. The earliest art of the region comes from the Kerma culture, which was contemporary to Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt. Art from this period exhibits Egyptian faience along with distinct black-topped pottery of Nubian origin. In the latter Napatan period of the Kingdom of Kush, art showed more influence from Egypt as the people in the region were worshiping Egyptian gods.

After these historical periods, the inhabitants of Sudan created artworks in different styles, both in indigenous African ways or influenced by Byzantine Christian, Islamic and modern art traditions.

=== African Diaspora ===
== Museums ==
Many art and ethnographic museums have a section dedicated to the art from Sub-Saharan Africa, such as the British Museum, Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac in Paris, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Not many Western museums are dedicated only to African art, like the Africa Museum in Brussels, National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., and African Art Museum of Maryland in Columbia, Maryland. Some colleges and universities hold collections of African art, like Howard University in Washington, DC and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia.

Nearly all countries in Africa have at least a national museum housing African art, often very largely from that country, such as the Sierra Leone National Museum and Nigerian National Museum in Lagos. There are also many smaller museums in the provinces.

The display of African art and artifacts in European museums has long been controversial in various ways, and the French-commissioned &quot;Report on the restitution of African cultural heritage&quot; (2018) has marked a key moment, leading to an increase in the return of artifacts. However, there are other examples, such as the Museum of African Art in Belgrade which was opened in 1977 because of Yugoslavia&#x27;s relations with many African countries thanks to the Non-Aligned Movement. The museum was opened out of the desire to acquaint the people of Yugoslavia with the art and culture of Africa since there was a deeply rooted notion about Yugoslavia sharing a friendship with African countries thanks to their similar struggles; all of the original items in the museums were legally bought by the Yugoslav ambassador and journalist Zdravko Pečar and his wife Veda Zagorac, while more recent acquisitions were either bought by the museum, received as gifts from Yugoslavs who lived in Africa, or were diplomatic gifts to the museum by the ambassadors of African countries.

The Congolese activist Mwazulu Diyabanza has taken direct action against European museums to take back items he says belong to Africa.

<text>Willy Matheisl (born 1950) in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany was educated in photography in the city of Zuerich, Switzerland, Europe. He was travelling the world for decades as a freelance travel photographer photographing for stock agencies and publishers. Landscape photography was very important to him and so it is no wonder that he worked with the legendary Linhof Panorama camera 6x17 using medium format roll film 6x6.

He is a photographer living in Deggendorf, Bavaria, Germany since 1985. He is the creator of a famous photo of a tree through the four seasons. The image has been used on calendars, on book covers and school books. (see external link below).

<text>In law, a summary judgment, also referred to as judgment as a matter of law or summary disposition, is a judgment entered by a court for one party and against another party summarily, i.e., without a full trial. Summary judgments may be issued on the merits of an entire case, or on discrete issues in that case. The formulation of the summary judgment standard is stated in somewhat different ways by courts in different jurisdictions. In the United States, the presiding judge generally must find there is &quot;no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot; In England and Wales, the court rules for a party without a full trial when &quot;the claim, defence or issue has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.&quot;

In common-law systems, questions about what the law actually is in a particular case are decided by judges; in rare cases jury nullification of the law may act to contravene or complement the instructions or orders of the judge, or other officers of the court. A factfinder has to decide what the facts are and apply the law. In traditional common law the factfinder was a jury, but in many jurisdictions the judge now acts as the factfinder as well. It is the factfinder who decides &quot;what really happened&quot;, and it is the judge who applies the law to the facts as determined by the factfinder, whether directly or by giving instructions to the jury. In the absence of an award of summary judgment (or some type of pretrial dismissal), a lawsuit ordinarily proceeds to trial, which is an opportunity for litigants to contest evidence in an attempt to persuade the factfinder that they are saying &quot;what really happened&quot;, and that, under the applicable law, they should prevail. The necessary steps before a case can get to trial include disclosing documents to the opponent by discovery, showing the other side the evidence, often in the form of witness statements. This process is lengthy, and can be difficult and costly.

A party moving (applying) for summary judgment is attempting to avoid the time and expense of a trial when, in the moving party&#x27;s view, the outcome is obvious. Typically this is stated as, when all the evidence likely to be put forward is such that no reasonable factfinder could disagree with the moving party, summary judgment is appropriate. Sometimes this will occur when there is no real dispute as to what happened, but it also frequently occurs when there is a nominal dispute but the non-moving party cannot produce enough evidence to support its position. A party may also move for summary judgment in order to eliminate the risk of losing at trial, and possibly avoid having to go through discovery (i.e., by moving at the outset of discovery), by demonstrating to the judge, via sworn statements and documentary evidence, that there are no material factual issues remaining to be tried. If there is nothing for the factfinder to decide, then the moving party asks rhetorically, &quot;why have a trial?&quot; The moving party will also attempt to persuade the court that the undisputed material facts require judgment to be entered in its favor. In many jurisdictions, a party moving for summary judgment takes the risk that, although the judge may agree there are no material issues of fact remaining for trial, the judge may also find that it is the &quot;non-moving&quot; party that is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===United States===
In the United States federal courts, summary judgment is governed by Federal Rule of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, derived primarily from the three seminal cases concerning summary judgment out of the 1980s. See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56; &quot;Celotex Corp. v. Catrett&quot;, , 322–27 (1986) (clarifying the shifting allocations of burdens of production, persuasion, and proof at summary judgment);
&quot;Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.&quot;, , 257 (1986) (applying heightened evidentiary standard of proof in libel action 
to judicial assessment of propriety of summary judgment); &quot;Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.&quot;, , 596–98 (1986) (holding antitrust plaintiff with an inherently implausible claim was subject to dismissal at summary judgment).

In American legal practice, summary judgment can be awarded by the court before trial, effectively holding that no trial will be necessary. At the federal level, a summary-judgment motion in United States District Court is governed by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Other pretrial motions, such as a &quot;motion for judgment on the pleadings&quot; or a &quot;motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted&quot;, can be converted by the judge to summary-judgment motions if matters outside the pleadings are presented toand not excluded bythe trial-court judge.

A party seeking summary judgment (or making any other motion) is called the movant (usually, this is &quot;defendant&quot;); the opposing party is the nonmovant (usually, &quot;plaintiff&quot;). Per Rule 56(a), issuance of summary judgment can be based only upon the court&#x27;s finding that, &quot;both:&quot;

# there exists no disputed, genuine issue of material fact between the parties requiring a trial to resolve; and
# in applying the law to the (undisputed) facts, one party is clearly entitled by law to judgment.

Here:
* An issue of (purported) fact is a (potential) event that the factfinder at trial (jury, or judge in the case of a bench trial) is charged with crediting (determining what &quot;really happened&quot;, according to the credibility of the witnesses/experts/etc. at trial).
* A disputed issue/fact means movant claims one thing, while nonmovant makes a different (conflicting/contradictory) claim.
* A genuine issue/fact is one that can be resolved in favor by either party, by some rational/reasonable factfinder.
* A material issue/fact is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case/issue in dispute (judgment in favor of one party over the other).

Of cardinal importance here is that, by design, the judge had no discretion at summary judgment time: all fact-finding is done by the jury at trial, not by the judge at summary judgment (the judge only looks for the existence of disputed facts to be found).

Summary judgment in the United States applies only in civil cases. It does not apply to criminal cases to obtain a pretrial judgment of conviction or acquittal, in part because a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a jury trial. Some federal and state-court judges publish general guidelines and sample summary judgment forms.

According to Federal Judicial Center research, summary-judgment motions are filed in 17% of federal cases. 71% of summary-judgment motions were filed by defendants, 26% by plaintiffs. Out of these, 36% of the motions were denied, and 64% were granted in whole or in part.
From a tactical perspective, there are two basic types of summary-judgment motions. One requires a &quot;full&quot; evidentiary presentation, and the other requires only a more limited, targeted one.

First, a plaintiff may seek summary judgment on any cause of action, and similarly, a defendant may seek summary judgment in its favor on any affirmative defense. But in either case, the moving party must produce evidence in support of &quot;each and every&quot; essential element of the claim or defense (as it would have to do at trial). To be successful, this type of summary-judgment motion must be drafted as a written preview of a party&#x27;s entire case-in-chief (that it would put before the finder of fact at trial) because &quot;all&quot; parts of an entire claim or defense are at issue.

Second, a different and very common tactic is where a defendant seeks summary judgment on a plaintiff&#x27;s cause of action. The key difference is that in this latter situation, the defendant need only attack &quot;one&quot; essential element of the plaintiff&#x27;s claim. A finding that the plaintiff cannot prove &quot;one&quot; essential element of its claim necessarily renders all other elements immaterial and results in summary judgment for the defendant. So these motions tend to be precisely targeted to the weakest points of the plaintiff&#x27;s case. It is also possible for a plaintiff to seek summary judgment on a defendant&#x27;s affirmative defense, but those types of motions are very rare.

Regardless of the type of summary judgment motion, there is a standardized rule(-like) framework for evaluating the first clause of Rule 56(a) (&quot;no disputed genuine issue of material fact&quot;), formulated as the following six core &quot;summary judgment tenets of review&quot; (SJTOR) (where the emphasized must indicate the lack of judicial discretion permitted):

# All issues/facts: All (&quot;each/every&quot;, not just &quot;some&quot;) factual issues must be considered/discussed—especially, all disputed/contested genuine issues of material facts.
# Whole record: The entire record (&quot;whole set/totality of circumstances&quot;, not just a &quot;subset&quot;), must be considered, regarding each/every issue.
# In context: All issues must be considered in holistic relationship with one another, within the whole-record environment (not context-free line-by-line isolation); patterns may emerge.
# Nonmovant trumps movant: Tenets 1–3 must be interpreted/construed in the light most favorable/advantageous to nonmovant (never to movant), and belief/credit awarded thereto (as to whether a dispute exists, not as to who wins the dispute, though either interpretation unambiguously satisfies the only question at summary judgment, which is whether or not a dispute exists).
# All inferences: All reasonable/justifiable logical/legal inferences/implications from tenets 1–3 must also be interpreted favorably to nonmovant, and credit awarded thereto.
# Light burden: For tenets 4–5, nonmovant bears the undemanding requirement of production only of favorable facts (and law)—i.e., &quot;de minimis&quot; proof/persuasion (that a rational/reasonable jury could find for nonmovant). All fact/credibility-finding must be reserved for the jury at trial, none for the judge at summary judgment.

A party seeking summary judgment may refer to any evidence that would be admissible at trial, such as depositions (or deposition excerpts), party admissions, affidavits in support from witnesses, documents received during discovery (such as contracts, emails, letters, and certified government documents). The pieces of evidence should be accompanied by a declaration from the moving party that all copies of the documents are true and correct, including deposition excerpts. Each party may present to the court its view of applicable law by submitting a legal memorandum supporting, or opposing, the motion. The opposing party may also file its own summary-judgment motion (called a &quot;cross-motion&quot;), if the deadline still allows. The court may allow for oral argument of the lawyers, generally where the judge wishes to question the lawyers on issues in the case.

Deadline for filing of the dispositive motions in U.S. federal court system is set by judge in the initial discovery plan order. If a party wants to file a motion or a cross-motion for summary judgment after the deadline, it needs to ask for leave of court. Normally, federal judges require valid reasons to alter case-management deadlines and only do so with reluctance.

There are also freely accessible web search engines to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law. Google Scholar is the biggest database of full-text state and federal court decisions that can be accessed without charge. These web search engines often allow one to select specific state courts to search.
Summary judgment is awarded if the undisputed facts and the law make it clear that it would be impossible for one party to prevail if the matter were to proceed to trial. The court must consider all designated evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion.

If a trial could result in the jury (or judge in a bench trial) deciding in favor of the party opposing the motion, then summary judgment is inappropriate. A decision granting summary judgment can be appealed without delay. A decision denying summary judgment ordinarily cannot be immediately appealed; instead, the case continues on its normal course. In United States federal courts, a denial of summary judgment cannot be appealed until final resolution of the whole case, because of the requirements of and (the final judgment rule).

To defeat a summary-judgment motion, the non-moving party only has to show substantial evidence that a dispute of material facts exists, regardless of the strength of that evidence. For example, even if the moving side can produce the testimony of &quot;a dozen bishops&quot;, and the non-moving side only has the testimony of a known liar, then summary judgment is not appropriate. Deciding on the relative credibility of witnesses is a question for the factfinder at trial.

Where appropriate, a court may award judgment summarily upon fewer than all claims. This is known as &quot;partial summary judgment&quot;.

====Reviews of summary judgments====
It is not uncommon for summary judgments of the lower U.S. courts in complex cases to be overturned on appeal. A grant of summary judgment is reviewed &quot;de novo&quot;, meaning, without deference to the views of the trial judge, both as to the determination that there is no remaining genuine issue of material fact and that the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

====State-court practice====
Summary judgment practice in state courts in
most U.S. states is similar to federal practice, though with minor differences. For example, the U.S. state of California requires the moving party to actually present evidence rather than merely refer to evidence. This is done by attaching relevant documents and by summarizing all relevant factual points within those documents in a separate statement of facts. In turn, the record to be reviewed by the judge can be very large; for example, the landmark &quot;Aguilar&quot; case involved a record of about 18,400 pages. Also, California uses the term &quot;summary adjudication&quot; instead of &quot;partial summary judgment&quot;. The California view is that the latter term is an oxymoron since a judgment is defined by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 577 as the &quot;final determination of the rights of the parties&quot; and a &quot;partial summary judgment&quot; is not actually final since it necessarily leaves some issues to be decided at trial. There is currently a conflict between the different districts of the California Courts of Appeal as to the availability of summary adjudication; most superior courts tend to side with the narrowest interpretation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, under which a party may make such a motion only with respect to an entire cause of action, an affirmative defense, or a punitive-damages claim. There is also language in section 437c about &quot;issues of duty&quot;, but some Court of Appeal panels have given that phrase an extremely narrow interpretation due to evidence that the California State Legislature has been trying to stop the state courts from engaging in the piecemeal adjudication of individual issues.

In New York, there is the procedure of summary judgment in lieu of complaint CPLR § 3213. This allows a plaintiff in an action based on an instrument to pay money only or a judgment to file a motion for summary judgment and supporting papers with the summons instead of a complaint. The motion must be noted to be heard on the date the defendant is required to appear under CPLR 320(a). If the plaintiff sets down the hearing date later than the minimum, he may require the defendant to serve a copy of the answering paper on him within the extended period. If the motion is denied the moving and answering papers shall be deemed the complaint and answer, respectively, unless the court orders otherwise.

====Filing and privacy====
Many U.S. district courts have developed their own requirements included in local rules for filing summary-judgment motions. Local rules can set limits on the number of pages, explain if a separate factual statement is required, whether it is acceptable to combine motion petition with a response, and if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called a judge&#x27;s copy), etc. Local rules can define page-layout elements like margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory footer text, page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together – i.e., acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the local rules, then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the local rules.
Summary-judgment motions, like many other court filings, are a matter of public record. So under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.2, sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children&#x27;s names, should be redacted from the summary-judgment motion and accompanying exhibits. The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted – most often by stamping the word &quot;redacted&quot; on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court&#x27;s permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor&#x27;s name of the petitions should be replaced with initials.

However, certain types of filings containing information that would otherwise be redacted are excepted from redaction. Additionally, the local rules may require parties seeking to seal documents to first file a motion to seal and obtain leave of the court prior to filing the sealed documents. 
A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with the court should be provided to the other parties in the case.

====Criminal law counterpart====
In the United States, the criminal law counterpart to summary judgment is the motion to dismiss.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules governs the award of summary judgment. Summary judgment is available in all claims against both the defendant and claimant with the following exceptions.
* There may be no summary judgment in possession proceedings against a mortgagor or a person holding over after the end of his tenancy whose occupancy is protected within the meaning of the Rent Act 1977 or the Housing Act 1988.
* There may be no summary judgment against a defendant in admiralty proceedings &quot;in rem&quot;.

===Canada===
Summary judgment procedures were broadened in Canadian courts in the 1980s. With the exception of Quebec (which has its own procedural device for disposing of abusive claims summarily), all provinces feature a summary judgment mechanism in their respective rules of civil procedure. Ontario, after a study on the issues of access to justice, reformed its rules in 2010 to extend the powers of motion judges and masters for ordering summary judgment, following the introduction of similar measures in Alberta and British Columbia.
In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada encouraged greater use of the procedure by the courts in its ruling in &quot;Hryniak v. Mauldin&quot;. In this case, the Supreme Court of Canada announced a cultural shift, in favor of greater reliance on summary judgment motions to adjudicate disputes, as opposed to reliance on conventional trial. This shift was urged by a desire to increase access to civil justice, by interpreting summary judgment rules broadly, &quot;favoring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely and just adjudication of claims&quot;.

However, since the decision in &quot;Hyniak&quot;, a number of court decisions have sought to limit its use in the context of motions for partial summary judgments. In &quot;Butera v. Chown, Cairns LLP&quot;, the Ontario Court of Appeal reports &quot;the increase in summary judgment motions that have flowed since Hryniak&quot; and that judges &quot;are required to spend time hearing partial summary judgment motions and writing comprehensive reasons on an issue that does not dispose of the action.&quot;

=== Turkey ===

Summary judgments are not permitted under Turkish law.

=== Germany ===
There is no specific provision in German law for summary judgment, though a judge may dismiss a clearly unfounded case on the merits after a hearing and without receiving evidence into the record.

=== China ===
Summary judgment exists in Hong Kong. The test is whether there is a triable issue and if there is one, whether it amounts to an arguable defense.

<text>Getty Images Holdings, Inc. (stylized as gettyimages) is a visual media company and supplier of stock images, editorial photography, video, and music for business and consumers, with a library of over 477 million assets. It targets three markets—creative professionals (advertising and graphic design), the media (print and online publishing), and corporate (in-house design, marketing and communication departments).

Getty Images has distribution offices around the world and capitalizes on the Internet for distribution with over 2.3 billion searches annually on its sites. As Getty Images has acquired other older photo agencies and archives, it has digitized their collections, enabling online distribution. Getty Images operates a large commercial website that clients use to search and browse for images, purchase usage rights, and download images. Image prices vary according to resolution and type of rights. The company also offers custom photo services for corporate clients. In January 2025, it was announced that the company would be merging with Shutterstock.

==History==
In 1995, Mark Getty and chief executive officer Jonathan Klein co-founded Getty Investments LLC in London. Mark Getty is the company&#x27;s chairman. In September 1997, Getty Communications, as it was called at the time, merged with PhotoDisc, Inc. to form Getty Images. The company relocated to Seattle two years later and expanded in the United States, reaching 2,000 employees by 2006. In April 2003, Getty Images entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) to market each other&#x27;s images.

Getty Images acquired the Michael Ochs Archives in February 2007. The Michael Ochs Archives were described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the premier source of musician photography in the world&quot;.

In 2008, the private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman (H&amp;F) acquired Getty Images for $2.4 billion. In 2012, H&amp;F put Getty up for sale. As of the ensuing sale to Carlyle Group, the company was said to have an archive that included 80 million stills and illustrations. The company was acquired by the Getty family in 2018.

The company moved to its current headquarters, in the Union Station office complex in Seattle&#x27;s International District, in 2011.

In 2015, Jonathan Klein became the company&#x27;s chairman and Dawn Airey was hired as chief executive officer (CEO) of Getty Images. Airey remained in the role until 31 December 2018, at which time she became a non-executive director member of its board and Craig Peters was appointed CEO.

In 2019, Getty Images introduced Market Freeze, simplifying exclusivity of rights-managed images. Later that year, it announced that due to customers&#x27; changing needs, it plans to phase out rights-managed imagery by 2020 in favor of royalty-free images.

In December 2021, Getty Images announced its intention to become publicly traded once more through combination with CC Neuberger Principal Holdings II. In July 2022, the SPAC merger was completed and the newly formed parent company of Getty Images went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GETY.

Activist investor Trillium Capital made an unsolicited bid to acquire Getty for billion in April 2023representing nearly a 100 percent premium. Getty turned down the offer questioning its credibility.

In September 2023, Getty announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty&#x27;s library of licensed photos. Getty will use Nvidia&#x27;s Edify model, which is available on Nvidia&#x27;s generative AI model library Picasso. Their stock footage is used in Baby Einstein and &quot;Little Einsteins.&quot;

In January 2025, it was announced that the company would be merging with Shutterstock.

==Acquisitions==

Since its formation, Getty Images has pursued an aggressive programme of acquisition, buying up many privately owned agencies that had built up the stock photography industry, from small family-run firms to larger agencies. By 1999, it had acquired one of the largest agencies, Tony Stone Images; the online art seller Art.com; the sports photography agency Allsport; the market leader in the Benelux and Scandinavia: Word View (1996, from Bert Blokhuis, four offices, for undisclosed sum); journalistic specialists Liaison Agency; Newsmakers, the first digital news photo agency; Online USA, a specialist in celebrity shots; and the Hulton Press Library, the former archive of the British photojournalistic magazine &quot;Picture Post&quot;. The Hulton collection was sold by the BBC to Brian Deutsch in 1988, when it was renamed Hulton Deutsch. In 1996, the Hulton collection was sold on once more, this time purchased by Getty Images and renamed Hulton Getty. With the acquisition of the Hulton library, Getty Images took ownership of the rights to some 15 million photographs from British press archives dating back to the nineteenth century. Hulton Getty also included photographs from the Keystone Collection, as well as images by notable photographers such as Bert Hardy, Bill Brandt, Weegee and Ernst Haas.

Getty has branched out into stock audio, music and sound effects, and also video with the acquisition of EyeWire and Energy Film Library. Getty has partnered with other companies including Slidely for companies and advertisers to use the Getty Images video library of around 2 million videos.

In 2000, Getty acquired one of its main competitors, Archive Photos of New York (a division of The Image Bank), for US$183 million. The Archive Photos library was combined with the Hulton Getty collection to form a new subsidiary, Hulton Archive. Archive Photos was formed in 1990 from the merger of Pictorial Parade (est. 1935) and Frederick Lewis Stock Photos (est. 1938), two well-established US photo agencies. Their collections included archive images from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Metronome&quot; and George Eastman House, and works by photographers such as Ruth Orkin, Anacleto Rapping, Deborah Feingold, Murray Garrett, Nat Fein and John Filo.

Further acquisitions followed, with the purchase in 2004 of image.net for US$20 million. On 9 February 2006, the microstock photo website iStockphoto was acquired by Getty Images for US$50 million. In 2007, Getty successfully purchased its largest competitor, MediaVast, for $207 million. The acquisition gave Getty Images control of WireImage (Entertainment, creative, and sports photography), FilmMagic (fashion and red carpet photography), and Contour Photos (portrait and studio photography). Getty Images also acquired other subsidiaries, including Master Delegates, which includes Isifa Image Service in Prague and Laura Ronchi in Italy. In 2008, Getty purchased Redferns Music Picture Library, the music photo library built up by British jazz photographer David Redfern.

On 23 October 2008, Getty Images announced their intention to buy Jupitermedia&#x27;s online images division, Jupiterimages, for $96 million in cash. The sale went ahead in February 2009; Jupiterimages (including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert) is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Getty. Jupitermedia, now trading as WebMediaBrands, continues its Internet publishing business, which they didn&#x27;t sell to Getty Images.

On 25 January 2016, Corbis announced that it had sold its image licensing business, including the Corbis Images, Corbis Motion and Veer libraries and their associated assets, to Unity Glory, an affiliate of Visual China Group—Getty&#x27;s exclusive distributor in China. Concurrently, it was announced that VCG would, after a transition period, license distribution and marketing of the Corbis library outside of China to Getty. Getty now manages Corbis&#x27;s physical archives on behalf of VCG and Unity Glory.

In March 2021, Getty Images acquired Unsplash, a free-to-use stock photography website, for an undisclosed sum.

==Corporate ownership and management==
In February 2008, it was announced that Getty Images would be acquired by the private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman in a transaction valued at an estimated US$2.4 billion. On 2 July 2008, Getty Images announced the completion of its acquisition. Getty Images common stock ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange at the close of the acquisition and was delisted from the NYSE.

In 2012, H&amp;F engaged investment bankers to sell the company. While a price of $4 billion was initially discussed, in August when the private equity firm Carlyle Group emerged as the likely acquirer, the price under consideration was said to be $3.3–3.4 billion. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was also said to have been bidding but had yet to top Carlyle&#x27;s price. The sale to Carlyle thereafter was announced at $3.3 billion, with co-founders Getty and Klein and the Getty family all carrying their investments over into the new ownership structure. Getty continues to serve as chairman and Klein as chief executive.

In September 2018, the Getty family announced it would acquire majority stake in the company from The Carlyle Group. In July 2022, the company went public again.

==Gallery==
The Getty Images Gallery was located at 46 Eastcastle Street, London. 

In 2008, it hosted an exhibition of children for Barnardo&#x27;s child adoption agency, in an exhibition called &quot;Home Time&quot;, aimed at helping to find homes for hundreds of children waiting for adoption. It included photographs by celebrity photographer Cambridge Jones, as well as by Cherie Blair, Bruce Oldfield, Andrew Lincoln, Gail Porter, and Claudia Winkleman.

The gallery permanently closed in January 2019. 

==Copyright enforcement and controversy==
Beginning in 2008, Getty Images has been the subject of controversy for its methods of pursuing copyright enforcement on behalf of its photographers. Rather than pursue a policy of sending &quot;cease and desist&quot; notices, Getty typically mails a demand letter that claims substantial monetary damages from owners of websites it believes infringed on their photographers&#x27; copyrights. Getty commonly tries to intimidate website owners by sending collection agents, even though a demand letter does not create a debt.

One photographer noted, &quot;Courts don&#x27;t like to be used as a means of extortion.&quot; In one case, Getty sent a church in Lichfield, Staffordshire, a £6,000 bill for photographs it used on its website, apparently placed there by a church volunteer. In this case, the church offered to pay Getty what it thought was a reasonable amount. The diocese&#x27;s communications director said:

Getty was not playing ball or following the normal litigation or dispute resolution procedures and [I advised the church] to ignore them. We don&#x27;t deal with bullies; we deal with legal threats appropriately. I told [Getty] by letter that&#x27;s what [the church was] doing, that we were not going to play, and didn&#x27;t hear any more. 

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described other instances in which Getty or other stock photo businesses dropped a claim when a website owner refused to pay and hired a lawyer. A law firm was quoted as saying: &quot;Once we get involved generally Getty does back off.&quot;

In 2009, Oscar Michelen, a New York attorney who focuses on such damages claims, said: &quot;The damages they&#x27;re requesting aren&#x27;t equal to the copyright infringement,&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s no law that says definitively what images are worth in the digital age.&quot; He called Getty&#x27;s effort to assess four-figure fines &quot;a legalized form of extortion&quot;.

In an effort to combat online copyright infringement, in March 2014 Getty Images made over 35 million images available free for non-commercial online use via embedding with attribution and a link back to the Getty Images website. According to Getty Images executive Craig Peters, &quot;The principle is to turn what&#x27;s infringing use with good intentions, turning that into something that&#x27;s valid licensed use with some benefits going back to the photographer&quot;.

On 15 February 2018, Google Images&#x27; interface was modified in order to meet the terms of a settlement and licensing partnership with Getty. The &quot;View image&quot; button (a deep link to the image itself on its source server) was removed from image thumbnails. This change is intended to discourage users from directly viewing the full-sized image (although doing so using a browser&#x27;s context menu on the embedded thumbnail is not frustrated), and encourage them to view the image in its appropriate context (which may also include attribution and copyright information) on its respective web page. The &quot;Search by image&quot; button has also been downplayed, as reverse image search can be used to find higher-resolution copies of copyrighted images. Google also agreed to make the copyright disclaimer within the interface more prominent.

===Copyright infringement lawsuits===
In 2009, Car-Freshner Corp., makers of Little Trees, filed a lawsuit against Getty Images in U.S. Federal Court, Northern District New York (Case 7:09-cv-01252-GTS -GHL). Car-Freshner claimed that Getty Images had in its catalog photos that included the famous &quot;tree-shaped&quot; trademarked car fresheners. In 2011, Getty Images attempted to have the case dismissed, but its motion was denied. In 2012, Getty Images agreed to settle by paying $100,000 to Car-Freshener Corp., but admitted no wrongdoing.

In September 2013, Avril Nolan brought a $450,000 suit against Getty Images. Nolan alleged that Getty Images improperly let her image be used in advertisements that depicted her as HIV-positive. She claimed the ad&#x27;s depiction of her as HIV-positive (she is not) hurt her personal and professional relationships and caused her emotional distress. In March 2014 a judge ruled the lawsuit will be taken to court rather than dismissed. Getty Images settled with Nolan in January 2015.

In November 2013, Getty and Agence France-Presse were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on Twitter related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter&#x27;s terms of service.

In July 2016, Getty was sued, unsuccessfully, for over $1 billion by Carol Highsmith, an American photographer notable for donating her 100,000+ image collection, royalty-free, to the Library of Congress, when Highsmith found that Getty had been selling unauthorized licenses of her work (an instance of copyfraud). Highsmith found out about this when she received a letter from a law firm representing Getty, demanding $120 for displaying her pictures on a personal website of hers.

In August 2016, Zuma Press, an independent press agency, filed suit against Getty for alleged copyright violations and unauthorized licensing of more than 47,000 images.

=== Claiming copyright over public domain content ===
Getty Images has continued the practice that Corbis (whose license it acquired in 2016) has been criticized for of claiming copyright, watermarking and selling images that are in public domain, including images related to The Holocaust like the Warsaw Ghetto boy photo, the Polish cavalry in Sochaczew photograph, or images created by NASA. Getty has also tried to collect fees from photographers for use of their own images that they had previously put in the public domain.

Public-domain photos from historical photographers such as Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans have long been available for unrestricted downloading from the United States Library of Congress. The exact same images are also available from Getty Images, subject to a licensing fee of up to $5,000 for a six-month term. This demonstrates an example of copyfraud.

=== Controversy over AI-generated art ===

On January 17, 2023, Getty Images said it was suing Stability AI over the use of Getty&#x27;s images to train AI art generator Stable Diffusion and for imitating the Getty Images&#x27; trademark. Getty released its own AI image generator trained on its library of licensed stock images in September 2023.

<doc id="331024" wikidata="Q1079846" url="?curid=331024" title="Actual malice">
<text>In United States defamation law, actual malice is a legal requirement imposed upon public officials or public figures when they file suit for libel (defamatory printed communications). Compared to other individuals who are less well known to the general public, public officials and public figures are held to a higher standard of proof to succeed in a defamation lawsuit.

==History==
The Supreme Court adopted the actual malice standard in its landmark 1964 ruling in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, in which the Warren Court held that:

Although defined within the context of a media defendant, the rule requiring proof of actual malice applies to all defendants including individuals. The standard can make it very difficult to prevail in a defamation case, even when allegations against a public figure are unfair or proven false.

Rather than being newly invented for the case, the term was used already in existing libel law. In many jurisdictions, proof of &quot;actual malice&quot; was required for punitive damages to be awarded or for other increased penalties. For example, &quot;Times v. Sullivan&quot; examined an existing Alabama statute that required proof of actual malice before an award of punitive damages would be permitted. Since proof of the writer&#x27;s malicious intentions is hard to ascertain, proof that the writer knowingly published a falsehood was generally accepted as proof of malice (under the assumption that only a malicious person would knowingly publish a falsehood). In &quot;Sullivan&quot;, the Supreme Court adopted the term and gave it constitutional significance.

==Proof of malice==
Actual malice is different from common law malice, a term indicating spite or ill will. It may also differ from malice as defined in state libel law, as reflected in the 1983 case of &quot;Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.&quot;, although states may not define a lower threshold for defamation claims than that required by the First Amendment.

Actual malice may be shown in many ways, as long as the claim is properly supported by admissible evidence. Malice may be proven through any competent evidence, either direct or circumstantial. All of the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction may be shown, provided they are not too remote, including threats, other defamatory statements, subsequent statements made by the defendant, any circumstances that indicate the existence of rivalry, ill will, or hostility between the parties, and facts that tend to show a reckless disregard of the plaintiff&#x27;s rights on the part of the defendant.

<doc id="331027" wikidata="Q863274" url="?curid=331027" title="Billy Wolfe (politician)">
<text>William Cuthbertson Wolfe (22 February 1924 – 18 March 2010) was a Scottish accountant, manufacturer and Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was the National Convenor (leader) of the SNP from 1969 to 1979, playing a central role in the transformation of the SNP into a modern, progressive political movement, and in the development of the SNP&#x27;s social democratic political philosophy.

==Background==
Wolfe was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, the son of Thomas Wolfe, owner of George Wolfe &amp; Sons Ltd. and the Bathgate Forge Co. Ltd, which manufactured shovels. He was educated at Bathgate Academy and George Watson&#x27;s College, Edinburgh, and saw active service during World War II, serving with the Scottish Horse (Royal Artillery) from 1942 to 1947 in France, the Low Countries, Germany, Indonesia and Malaya. Following demobilization, he qualified as a chartered accountant in 1952, and was company secretary of the family firms from 1952 to 1964.

He later established his own business, Chieftain Forge Ltd (1964–1986), supplying and manufacturing forestry equipment and shovels. Billy Wolfe was a man of wide interests: a longstanding member of the Saltire Society, the Scout Association and the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a Justice of the Peace, and an officebearer in the Scottish Poetry Library, as well as being a poet in Scots in his own right. Initially he was more interested in cultural matters, but his dissatisfaction with the government of Scotland grew, and he became convinced of the need for Scottish independence.

==Political career==
Wolfe joined the SNP in 1959. He stood as the SNP candidate in the 1962 West Lothian by-election against Tam Dalyell, making a stunning impact by coming in second place in an area where the SNP had previously made little impact. The result propelled him into party office as vice-chairman for Policy and Publicity in 1964, and then as Senior Vice-chairman (Deputy Leader) in 1966. Wolfe formed the Social and Economic Inquiry Society of Scotland, a forum committed to advancing the case for independence through statistical research. His idea of fusing the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross with a thistle led to the creation of a distinctive new SNP logo, which is still in use today. He played a central role in the development of party policy, writing an iconic policy statement, &quot;SNP and You&quot;, which radically changed the SNP&#x27;s outlook, adapting the existing policy on decentralization to accommodate the social strains from ongoing deindustrialization. Wolfe stood as SNP parliamentary candidate for West Lothian at the 1964, 1966, 1970, both elections in 1974, and 1979 general elections.

In June 1969, at the SNP Annual National Conference in Oban, Wolfe was elected as chairman (leader) of the SNP, defeating the incumbent leader, Arthur Donaldson, by 544 votes to 238. Having swung his support behind the ‘It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil’ campaign that changed the party&#x27;s fortunes, he associated the SNP with the trade union campaigns against shipyard and other industrial closures and asserted its role as a radical participant in Scottish politics. Wolfe was instrumental in identifying publicly the social democratic, left-of-centre credentials of the SNP.

It was during Wolfe&#x27;s period as leader that the party had considerable electoral success in elections to the Westminster parliament, winning 30% of the vote in Scotland and 11 of the 71 Scottish seats in the October 1974 General Election, though Wolfe failed to win a seat of his own in West Lothian in the two general elections of that year, despite gaining an increased share of the vote. His exclusion from the powerful new group of SNP MPs caused some difficulties for his leadership of the party. However, following a difficult period which saw the passing of the Scotland Act 1978, a number of internal divisions in the SNP and the failure of the party to win in a series of by-elections, in 1978 Wolfe announced his intention to stand down as leader after almost ten tumultuous years in office. The resultant loss of influence led to his being sidelined as the SNP moved into the 1979 general election campaign, and a disastrous performance in which the SNP only managed to retain 2 of their 11 MPs. Wolfe was succeeded by Gordon Wilson at the SNP Annual National Conference in September 1979.

In 1979, Wolfe encouraged a band of left-wingers in the SNP, known as the 79 Group, annoying those on the fundamentalist wing. Although he was elected as president of the SNP in 1980, succeeding Robert McIntyre, Wolfe&#x27;s term of office ended in June 1982, following an intervention by him in advance of the proposed visit of Pope John Paul II to Scotland, causing serious controversy by claiming the Pope represented an &quot;alien culture&quot;.

In a January 1982 letter to the Church of Scotland magazine, &quot;Life and Work&quot;, Wolfe attacked the appointment of a papal nuncio to the United Kingdom. In a subsequent letter to &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in April 1982, following the outbreak of the Falklands War, he said it would be a negation of democracy for &quot;the cruel and ruthless fascist dictatorship of a Roman Catholic state&quot;, i.e. Argentina, to take over the &quot;mainly Protestant and democratically minded Falklanders, mostly descendants of Scots&quot;. In both instances the SNP&#x27;s National Executive Committee disowned Wolfe&#x27;s statements, causing Wolfe to withdraw his candidacy from that year&#x27;s election for the office of party president. Wolfe later apologised for his remarks, saying &quot;I ask for forgiveness of those whom I hurt, if they understand me now. I can see myself then as others saw me ... I don&#x27;t know why I did it&quot;. His second wife, Kate McAteer, was a practising Roman Catholic.

==Personal life==
William Wolfe married Arna Dinwiddie in 1953 and they had four children. They divorced in 1989. He married Catherine McAteer in 1993. The marriage lasted until his death.

He died at Udston Hospital, Hamilton in March 2010, aged 86. Alex Salmond and Iain Gray were among the political leaders who offered their condolences. Salmond stated that Wolfe had &quot;transformed it [the SNP] into a modern political party&quot;.

<doc id="331028" wikidata="Q1507656" url="?curid=331028" title="George Jackson (activist)">
<text>George Lester Jackson (September 23, 1941 – August 21, 1971) was an American author, revolutionary, and convicted felon. While serving an indeterminate sentence for stealing $70 at gunpoint from a gas station in 1961, Jackson became involved in the Black power movement and co-founded the prison gang Black Guerrilla Family.

In 1970, he was one of three prisoners known as Soledad Brothers, charged with the murder of correctional officer John Vincent Mills in the aftermath of a prison fight. The same year, he published &quot;Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson&quot;, a combination of autobiography and manifesto addressed to an African-American audience. The book became a bestseller and earned Jackson personal fame.

Jackson was killed by prison guards in 1971, during an escape attempt in which three prison guards and two inmates were killed. He never went to trial for the Mills murder.

== Biography ==

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Jackson was the second son of Lester and Georgia Bea Jackson&#x27;s five children. He spent time in the California Youth Authority Corrections facility in Paso Robles due to several juvenile convictions including armed robbery, assault, and burglary.

In 1961, he was convicted of armed robbery – for stealing $70 at gunpoint from a gas station – and sentenced to one year to life in prison.

During his first years at San Quentin State Prison, Jackson became involved in revolutionary activity. He was described by white prison officials as egocentric and anti-social. In 1966, Jackson met and befriended W. L. Nolen, who introduced him to Marxist and Maoist ideology. The two founded the Black Guerrilla Family in 1966 based on Marxist and Maoist political thought. In speaking of his ideological transformation, Jackson remarked: &quot;I met Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Engels, and Mao when I entered prison and they redeemed me.&quot; In his 1972 book &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot;, Jackson describes himself as a &quot;Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Fanonist&quot;.

As Jackson&#x27;s disciplinary infractions grew he spent more time in solitary confinement, where he studied political economy and radical theory. He also wrote many letters to friends and supporters, which would later be edited and compiled into the books &quot;Soledad Brother&quot; and &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot;, bestsellers that brought him a great deal of attention from leftist organizers and intellectuals in the U.S. and Western Europe. He amassed a following of inmates, including whites and Latinos, and most enthusiastically from other black inmates. The 1994 edition of &quot;Soledad Brother&quot; includes a foreword written by his nephew, the artist Jonathan P. Jackson, Jr. 

In January 1969, Jackson and Nolen were transferred from San Quentin to Soledad Prison. On January 13, 1970, corrections officer Opie G. Miller shot Nolen and two other black prisoners (Cleveland Edwards and Alvin Miller) during a yard riot with members of the Aryan Brotherhood, killing all three. Following Nolen&#x27;s death, Jackson became increasingly confrontational with corrections officials and spoke often about the need to protect fellow inmates and take revenge on correction officers, employing what Jackson called &quot;selective retaliatory violence&quot;.

On January 17, 1970, Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clutchette were charged with murdering a corrections officer, John V. Mills, who was beaten and thrown from the third floor of Soledad&#x27;s Y wing. This was a capital offense and a successful conviction would have put Jackson in the gas chamber. Mills was purportedly killed in retaliation for the shooting deaths of three inmates by Miller the previous year. Miller had not been charged with any crime, as a grand jury ruled his actions during the prison fight as justifiable homicide.

In the aftermath Jackson, Drumgo, and Clutchette became known as the Soledad Brothers and activists worked to get the three acquitted whom they viewed as being political prisoners and accused based on their race. The activists also wanted to bring attention to the disproportionate rates at which people of color were being incarcerated compared to white people and to the socioeconomic factors that led to their imprisonment in the first place. The Soledad Brothers Defense Committee was formed by Fay Stender and had many famous activists, celebrities, and writers join and support the committee. Among these activists was Angela Davis. Davis while working with the committee would eventually become a leader of the committee and become a close friend of Jackson. Jackson and Davis corresponded over letters frequently and Jackson had sent a manuscript of his book &quot;Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson,&quot; and asked her to read it and asked for her help in improving it.

== Marin County courthouse incident ==
On August 7, 1970, George Jackson&#x27;s 17-year-old brother Jonathan P. Jackson burst into a Marin County courtroom with an automatic weapon, freed prisoners James McClain, William A. Christmas and Ruchell Magee, and took Judge Harold Haley, Deputy District Attorney Gary Thomas, and three jurors hostage to demand the release of the &quot;Soledad Brothers&quot;. Police killed Haley, Jackson, Christmas and McClain as they attempted to drive away from the courthouse. Eyewitness testimony suggests Haley was hit by fire discharged from a sawed-off shotgun that had been fastened to his neck with adhesive tape by the abductors. Thomas, Magee and one of the jurors were wounded. The case made national headlines.

Angela Davis, who owned the weapons used in the hostage taking, was later acquitted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and murder. A possible explanation for the gun connection is that Jonathan Jackson was her bodyguard. Magee, the sole survivor among the attackers, eventually pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975. Magee was imprisoned for over 60 years. He was released in 2023 under California&#x27;s compassionate release law passed that year.

== Prison escape and death ==

On August 21, 1971, Jackson met with attorney Stephen Bingham at San Quentin prison to discuss a civil lawsuit that Jackson had filed against the California Department of Corrections. After the meeting, Jackson was being escorted by officer Urbano Rubiaco back to his cell when Rubiaco noticed a metallic object in Jackson&#x27;s hair, later revealed to be a wig, and ordered him to remove it. Jackson then pulled a Spanish Astra 9 mm pistol from beneath the wig and said: &quot;Gentlemen, the dragon has come&quot;—a reference to Ho Chi Minh. It is not clear how Jackson obtained the gun. Bingham, who lived for 13 years as a fugitive before returning to the United States to face trial, was acquitted of charges that he smuggled a gun to Jackson.

Jackson ordered Rubiaco to open all the cells and along with several other inmates, he overpowered the remaining correction officers and took them, along with two inmates, hostage. Five other hostages, officers Jere Graham, Frank DeLeon, and Paul Krasnes, along with two white prisoners, were killed and found in Jackson&#x27;s cell. Three other officers, Rubiaco, Kenneth McCray, and Charles Breckenridge, were also shot and stabbed, but survived. After finding the keys for the Adjustment Center&#x27;s exit, Jackson along with fellow inmate and close friend Johnny Spain escaped to the yard where Jackson was shot dead from a tower and Spain surrendered.

Three inmates were acquitted and three (David Johnson, Johnny Spain, and Hugo Pinell) were convicted for the murders. The six became known as the &quot;San Quentin Six&quot;.

There is some evidence that Jackson and his supporters on the outside had planned the escape for several weeks. Three days before the escape attempt, Jackson rewrote his will, leaving all royalties as well as control of his legal defense fund to the Black Panther Party.

Jackson&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Augustine&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Oakland, California, on August 28, 1971.

== In popular culture ==
Several notable artists and entertainers have dedicated their work to Jackson&#x27;s memory or created works based on his life. The avant-garde jazz group Art Ensemble of Chicago, affiliates of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, recorded and released the album &quot;A Jackson in Your House&quot; in Paris, France, in 1969. A non-album single was released by Bob Dylan, &quot;George Jackson&quot;, about the life and death of Jackson. The song made the American charts peaking at No. 33 in January 1972. The ninth track of the 2011 Blue Scholars album &quot;Cinemetropolis&quot; is named for Jackson and references the Soledad Brothers.

Jackson and his attempted prison escape are the subjects of the first verse of the Joan Baez parody song, &quot;Pull the Tregroes,&quot; on National Lampoon&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Radio Dinner&quot;.

Steel Pulse, an English reggae band from Birmingham wrote a song named &quot;Uncle George&quot; that contains a chorus of &quot;Soledad Brother&quot;. The song comes from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Tribute To The Martyrs&quot;, which also honours other Black civil rights activists including Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Steve Biko.

The 1994 song &quot;Jettin&#x27;&quot; by the hip-hop trio Digable Planets references George Jackson as one of their black revolutionary heroes who died in prison.

Ja Rule named his 2003 album &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot; after Jackson&#x27;s book. Saxophone player Archie Shepp dedicated most of his album &quot;Attica Blues&quot; (1972) to the story of George Jackson (&quot;Blues for Brother George Jackson&quot;) and the Attica prison riots that followed.

Stephen Jay Gould wrote, in his 1981 book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, of George Jackson&#x27;s death in context of &quot;statistically supported&quot; social Darwinism. Quoting Gould about the legacy of failed science which supported racial bigotry and physiognomy: &quot;George Jackson ... died under Lombroso&#x27;s legacy, trying to escape after eleven years (eight and a half in solitary) of an indeterminate one-year-to-life sentence for stealing seventy dollars from a gas station.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s life, beliefs and ultimate fate were the topic of one of the many audio tapes recorded at the Jonestown commune in Guyana during 1978. In the tape in question, Jim Jones touches on several issues relating to Jackson, most notably Jones&#x27; firm belief that Jackson&#x27;s death was a racist assassination. His admiration for the Black Panther activist on the tape is as clear as his disgust that one of his followers, Willie Malone, could think he was remotely in the same league as Jackson, and that it was &quot;punks&quot; like Malone who had sold Jackson out. 

Stanley Williams dedicated his 1998 book &quot;Life in Prison&quot; in part to George Jackson. In Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s response to Williams&#x27; appeal for clemency, the governor claimed that this dedication was &quot;a significant indicator that Williams is not reformed and that he still sees violence and lawlessness as a legitimate means to address societal problems.&quot;

&quot;Soulja&#x27;s Story&quot; is a song by rapper 2Pac (Tupac Shakur), released on the 1991 album &quot;2pacalypse Now&quot;, which makes reference to the Marin County Civic Center attacks. Shakur was the nephew of Black power revolutionary and fugitive, Assata Shakur.

The 2007 film &quot;Black August&quot; is a retelling of the last 14 months of Jackson&#x27;s life.

<text>Sir David Kim Hempleman-Adams, (born 10 October 1956) is a British industrialist and adventurer.

He is the first person to complete the Explorer&#x27;s Grand Slam, by reaching the Geographic and Magnetic North and South Poles, as well as climbing the highest peaks in all seven continents, the first person to fly to the North Pole in a balloon, and the first person to make a balloon crossing of the Atlantic in an open basket.

==Early life==
David Hempleman was born in Moredon, Swindon on 10 October 1956. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, he moved with his mother to Stoney Littleton near Bath, and, when she remarried, took his stepfather&#x27;s surname, Adams.

He took part in the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme at school, then pursued business studies at college in Manchester and at Bristol Polytechnic. At the same time, he started climbing with fellow student Steven Vincent.

==Expeditions==
In January 2007, Hempleman-Adams broke the quarter-century old world small sized hot air balloon altitude record, by ascending to 9,906 meters over Alberta, Canada, beating the previous record of 9,537 metres set by Carol Davis in New Mexico.

In September 2009, he broke the endurance record for a flight using the smallest man-carrying helium balloon. He flew 200 miles from Butler, Missouri, to Cherokee, Oklahoma, in 14 hours and 15 minutes using the class AA-01 balloon. The previous record was an eight hours and 12 minutes flight undertaken by American Coy Foster in March 1983.

On 10 October 2008, Hempleman-Adams, along with co-pilot Jon Mason won the 52nd Gordon Bennett Cup, having flown a helium balloon from Albuquerque, New Mexico and landing over 1000 miles away near Madison, Wisconsin. They are the first British team to win the prize in 102 years.

In September 2010, he competed in the Gordon Bennett 2010 balloon race when it was held in the UK for the first time.

==Personal and family life==
He lives in Wiltshire with his partner Ros Smith and has three daughters from his previous marriage.

In April 2008 his middle daughter, Camilla, at the age of 15, became the youngest person to ski the last degree to the North Pole.

In December 2011 his youngest daughter, Amelia, at the age of 16 became the youngest person to ski to the South Pole, having completed Shackleton&#x27;s last 98 nautical miles. In 2021 she competed at the Henley Royal Regatta.

==Social and charitable work==
He retired as a Trustee of St John Ambulance in 2021, having been involved with the charity for 26 years and having held senior positions since 1999. In 2002 he raised money to buy ambulances for St John through a series of lectures. In 2019 he sailed from Plymouth, England, to New York, to promote the work of St John and to encourage young people to try something new. In 2023 he agreed to take on a newly created senior volunteer role for St John International (SJI) as an ambassador leading our newly created Special Projects group. In this role he has been instrumental in leading St John International through the development of its new fundraising strategy. 

In summer 2016, Hempleman-Adams completed the Polar Ocean Challenge, an historic attempt to be the first British sailing yacht to sail around the Arctic Ocean in one summer season, circumnavigating the North Pole and sailing through the Northeast and Northwest Passages. This expedition was undertaken to increase awareness of climate change and loss of ice in the Arctic Ocean.

<text>The Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB) is a bridge–tunnel system consisting of a series of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands. It is both the longest sea crossing and the longest open-sea fixed link in the world. The HZMB spans the Lingding and Jiuzhou channels, connecting Hong Kong and Macau with Zhuhai—a major city on the Pearl River Delta in China.

The HZM Bridge was designed to last for 120 years and cost ¥127 billion (US$18.8 billion) to build. The cost of constructing the Main Bridge was estimated at ¥51.1 billion (US$7.56 billion) funded by bank loans and shared among the governments of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.

Originally set to be opened to traffic in late 2016, the structure was completed on 6 February 2018 and journalists were subsequently taken for a ride over the bridge. On 24 October 2018 the HZMB was opened to the public after its inauguration a day earlier by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

== Planning ==
=== Background ===
Hopewell Holdings founder and then-managing director Gordon Wu proposed the concept of a bridge-tunnel linking Mainland China, British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau in the 1980s. Wu stated that he got the idea in 1983 from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. In 1988 Wu pitched the concept to Guangdong and Beijing officials. He envisaged a link farther north than the current design, beginning at Black Point near Tuen Mun, Hong Kong and crossing the Pearl River estuary via Nei Lingding Island and Qi&#x27;ao Island. His proposed bridge would have ended at the Chinese village of Tangjia, and a new road would have continued south through Zhuhai before terminating at Macau. Discussions stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests in mid-1989 &quot;unnerved&quot; Wu and other foreign investors, and caused Hopewell&#x27;s Hong Kong share prices to plunge.

The route proposed by Wu was promoted by the Zhuhai government under the name Lingdingyang Bridge. In the mid-1990s, Zhuhai built a bridge between the Zhuhai mainland and Qi&#x27;ao Island that was intended as the first phase of this route, though the full scheme had not been approved by either the Chinese or Hong Kong governments at the time. China&#x27;s central government showed support for this project on 30 December 1997. The new Hong Kong government was reluctant, stating that it was still awaiting cross-border traffic study results, and Hong Kong media questioned the environmental impact of the project with regard to air pollution, traffic and marine life.

In December 2001 the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed a motion urging the Administration to develop the logistics industry including the construction of a bridge connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao. In September 2002, the China/Hong Kong Conference on Co-ordination of Major Infrastructure Projects agreed to a joint study on a transport link between Hong Kong and Pearl River West.

=== Preparation ===
To coordinate the project, the Advance Work Coordination Group of HZMB was set up in 2003. Officials from three sides solved issues such as landing points and alignments of the bridge, operation of the Border Crossing Facilities, and project financing.

In August 2008, China&#x27;s central government, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 42 percent of the total costs. The remaining 58% consisted of loans (approximately ¥22 billion or US$3.23 billion) from the Bank of China.

In March 2009, it was further reported that China&#x27;s central government, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 22 percent of the total costs. The remaining 78 percent consisted of loans (approximately ¥57.3 billion or US$8.4 billion) from a consortium of banks led by Bank of China.

== Construction ==
Construction of the HZMB project began on 15 December 2009 on the Chinese side, with the Politburo Standing member and Vice Premier of China Li Keqiang holding a commencement ceremony. Construction of the Hong Kong section of the project began in December 2011 after a delay caused by a legal challenge regarding the environmental impact of the bridge.

The last bridge tower was erected on 2 June 2016. The last straight element of the straight section of the undersea tunnel was installed on 12 July 2016, and the final tunnel joint was installed on 2 May 2017. Construction of the Main Bridge, consisting of a viaduct and an undersea tunnel was completed on 6 July 2017. The entire construction project was completed on 6 February 2018. During the construction 19 workers died.

== Sections and elements ==

The HZMB consists of three main sections: the Main Bridge () in the middle of the Pearl River estuary, the Hong Kong Link Road () in the east, and the Zhuhai Link Road () in the west of the estuary.

=== Main Bridge ===

The Main Bridge, the largest part of the HZMB project, is a bridge-tunnel system constructed by the mainland Chinese authorities. It connects Zhuhai-Macao Port Artificial Island, an artificial island housing the Boundary Crossing Facilities (BCF) for both mainland China and Macau in the west, to the Hong Kong Link Road in the east.

This section includes a bridge construction and a immersed tube undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands, the Blue Dolphin Island on the west and the White Dolphin Island on the east. The bridge construction crosses the Pearl River estuary with three cable-stayed bridges spanning between , allowing shipping traffic to pass underneath.

=== Hong Kong Link Road ===
Administered under Highways Department of HKSAR, the Hong Kong Link Road connects the main bridge-tunnel to an artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF). This section includes a bridge construction, a Scenic Hill Tunnel, and a at-grade road along the east coast of the Chek Lap Kok.

=== Zhuhai Link Road ===
The Zhuhai Link Road starts from Zhuhai-Macao Port Artificial Island, passes through the developed area of Gongbei via a tunnel towards Zhuhai, and connects to three major expressways, namely, the Jing-Zhu Expressway, Guang-Zhu West Expressway, and Jiang-Zhu Expressway.

=== Macau Bridge Link===
Opened in October 2024, the bridge provided alternative access to Taipa Island from the HZMB boundary office.

== Left- and right-hand traffic ==
Although the HZMB connects two left-hand traffic (LHT) areas, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the crossing itself is right-hand traffic (RHT), the same as in Zhuhai and other regions of mainland China (the bridge is technically in Zhuhai for most of its length). Thus, drivers from Hong Kong and Macau need to make use of crossing viaducts to switch to RHT upon entering the bridge, and back to LHT upon leaving the bridge when they are back to Hong Kong and Macau. Traffic between Zhuhai and the bridge requires no left-right conversion as they are both RHT.

== Transport ==

=== Shuttle buses ===

The HZMBus shuttle bus service (colloquially referred as the &quot;golden buses&quot;) runs 24 hours a day with bus departures as frequent as every five minutes. The journey across the HZMB takes about 40 minutes.

The HZMB Hong Kong Port can be reached from Hong Kong by taxi or various buses including Cityflyer airport routes A10, A11, A12, A17, A21, A22, A23, A25, A26, A28 and A29, Long Win Bus airport routes A30, A31, A32, A33X, A34, A36, A37, A38, A41, A41P, A42, A43, A46 and A47X, NLB airport route A35, Green Minibus route 901, the B4 shuttle bus from Hong Kong International Airport, the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from Tung Chung. In addition, all overnight airport buses (NA-prefixed routes) which are operated by Cityflyer or Long Win stops or terminates at the Hong Kong Port.

The HZMB Zhuhai Port can be reached from Zhuhai by taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or Line-12, 23, 25 or 3 buses.

The HZMB Macau Port can be reached from Macau by taxis or various buses including the 101X bus and the 102X bus from St Paul&#x27;s and Taipa, or the HZMB Integrated Resort Connection bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal or the Exterior Ferry terminal, connecting with free casino shuttle buses.

=== Private vehicles ===
Since the Hong Kong government imposes significant fees, taxes and administrative paperwork on private vehicle ownership and usage to deal with road congestion, driving a car on the HZMB would incur the same restrictions as current cross-border traffic. These include applying for separate driving licenses for both Hong Kong and mainland China, a Hong Kong Closed Road Permit for cross-boundary vehicles, and an Approval Notice from the Guangdong Public Security Bureau. Vehicle owners also need to ensure they have the appropriate insurance coverage for the regions they are travelling to.

By the end of 2017 only 10,000 permits for private vehicles to drive across the HZMB from Hong Kong to Zhuhai had been issued. In addition, the number of vehicles permitted to enter Hong Kong and Macau from other regions is subject to a daily quota.

In addition, to help compact Macau tackle its road congestion problems, drivers arriving from other regions are strongly encouraged to use a park and ride scheme, leaving their vehicles at a car park on the edge of Macau. A small quota of 300 vehicles are allowed to enter Macau directly.

In 2023 the permit/quota system relaxed further, allowing more Hong Kong and Macau vehicles to enter Guangdong Province via the Northbound Travel scheme. A similar Southbound Travel scheme is planned for 2025.

== Economic effects ==
The HZMB links three major cities—Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macau—which are geographically close but separated by water. With the bridge in place, travelling time between Zhuhai and Hong Kong was cut down from about 4 hours to 30 minutes on the road.

The HZMB project is part of a Beijing-driven strategy to create an economic hub and promote the economic development of the whole area of the Pearl River Delta, which is also known as Greater Bay Area. Hoping to leverage the bridge and create an economic zone linking the three cities, Zhuhai&#x27;s Hengqin area was designated as a free trade zone in 2015.

== Controversies ==

=== Usage ===
Some residents have complained that the bridge had been a waste of taxpayers&#x27; money due to the restrictive criteria to be met and large amount of administrative paperwork needed in order to use the bridge with their own vehicle. Consequently an average of only 8,900 vehicles per day have used the bridge in 2023. This is a huge difference compared to the similar Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link where over 3 million vehicles have used the bridge alone in its first month of opening.

On 31 January 2025, the Zhuhai port of the bridge reported a new record of 156,000 passenger trips, a new record since the bridge&#x27;s opening. A total of some 6 million trips were recorded in 2024, with 55% of vehicles carrying Hong Kong or Macau number plates.

=== Delays and budget overruns ===
The artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF) was reported drifting due to an unconventional method, hitherto unused in Hong Kong, for land reclamation using a row of circular steel cells pile-driven into the mud and filled with inert material to form a seawall.

The drifting of parts of the reclaimed island allegedly caused a delay in the HZMB project. The Highways Department denied various reports of movement up to but admitted that parts of the reclaimed land had moved &quot;up to six or seven metres&quot;, claiming that some movement was expected and safety had not been jeopardised.

Mainland contractors also reportedly had difficulty constructing immersed tubes for their section of the project, with the director of the Guangdong National Development and Reform Commission stating that 2020 would be a difficult target to meet.

By 2017, the Main Bridge of the HZMB project had experienced a cost overrun of about ¥10 billion, blamed on increased labour and material costs, as well as changes to the design and construction schemes.

=== Worker deaths and injuries ===
The number of deaths and injuries during the construction project came under scrutiny in Hong Kong. In addition to nine fatalities on the mainland side, more than ten deaths were reported on the Hong Kong side of the construction project, plus between 234 and 600 injuries, depending on the source. In April 2017, the Construction Site Workers General Union, the Labour Party and the Confederation of Trade Unions demonstrated at the Central Government Complex, demanding the government take action.

Lawmaker Fernando Cheung also expressed concern over the unknown death toll on the Chinese side of the project, speculating: &quot;the project is known as the &#x27;bridge of blood and tears&#x27; and we are only talking about the Hong Kong side. We don&#x27;t even know what is happening in China. I suppose the situation could be 10 times worse than that in Hong Kong.&quot; He said that the Hong Kong Government had a responsibility to consider worker safety on the Chinese side.

=== Faked safety testing ===

In 2017, Hong Kong&#x27;s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) arrested 21 employees (2 senior executives, 14 laboratory technicians, and 5 laboratory assistants) of Jacobs China Limited, a contractor of the Civil Engineering and Development Department for falsifying concrete test results, thus potentially risking the safety of the bridge for public use. In December 2017, a lab technician pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months, while the others await sentencing. Hong Kong&#x27;s Highways Department conducted tests again after the falsified results were exposed and found all test results met safety standards.

=== Seawall integrity ===
In April 2018, the public and media raised questions over the integrity of the seawalls protecting the artificial islands at both ends of the undersea tunnel. In footage taken by drone users and mariners, the dolosse installed at the edges of the artificial islands appear to have dislodged. Some civil engineers suggested that there was an error in design. In dismissing the safety concerns, the HZMB Authority said the dolosse were designed to be submerged and the design was working as intended. Director of Highways Department Daniel Chung denied on 8 April 2018 that the breakwater components had been washed away by waves.

Subsequent aerial footage posted online showed a section of the dolosse breakwater completely underwater. Civil engineer So Yiu-kwan told Hong Kong media on 12 April 2018 that the water level, at the time the photos were taken, was about 1.74 mPD (metres above Principal Datum), but the maximum water level could reach 2.7 mPD. He said the dolosse would offer no wave protection if entirely submerged, and further alleged that they had been installed backwards.

===Impact on wildlife===
Conservationists at WWF Hong Kong blamed the construction of the HZMB for the falling number of white dolphins in the waters near the bridge. The dolphins found near waters of Lantau were worst hit with numbers dropping by 60 percent between April 2015 and March 2016.

<text>Nicholas David Kershaw (born 1 March 1958) is an English singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He came to prominence in 1984 as a solo artist. He released eight singles that entered the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart during the decade, including &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot;, &quot;Dancing Girls&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, &quot;Human Racing&quot;, &quot;The Riddle&quot;, &quot;Wide Boy&quot;, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and &quot;When a Heart Beats&quot;. His 62 weeks on the UK Singles Chart through 1984 and 1985 beat all other solo artists. Kershaw appeared at the multi-venue benefit concert Live Aid in 1985 and has also penned a number of hits for other artists, including a UK No. 1 single in 1991 for Chesney Hawkes, &quot;The One and Only&quot;.

== Early years ==
Nicholas &quot;Nik&quot; Kershaw was born on 1 March 1958 in Bristol and grew up in Ipswich, Suffolk. His father was a flautist and his mother was an opera singer. He was educated at Northgate Grammar School for Boys where he played the guitar – he was self-taught on this instrument. He left school in the middle of his A-Levels and got a job at an unemployment benefit office. He also sang in a number of underground Ipswich bands. When the last of these, Fusion, broke up in 1982, he embarked on a full-time solo career as a musician and songwriter.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
Kershaw was unemployed for a year after leaving Fusion, but during this time he found manager Mickey Modern after placing an advertisement in the magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Modern secured a recording contract for Kershaw at MCA. In September 1983, Kershaw released his first single &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, which reached No. 47 on the UK Singles Chart. It became a major hit in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

At the beginning of 1984, Kershaw released his breakthrough song &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot;, which reached No. 4 in the UK, and was a big success in Europe, particularly in Ireland, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Scandinavia, and also in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The music video, featuring Kershaw as a chroma key-suited alien, received heavy rotation from MTV, helping the song to reach No. 46 in the United States. He enjoyed three more top 20 hits from his debut solo studio album &quot;Human Racing&quot;, including the title track and a successful re-issue of &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;. This track ultimately proved his biggest hit as a performer when it reached No. 2 in the UK.

Kershaw&#x27;s second studio album was &quot;The Riddle&quot;. The title track, released in November 1984, proved to be his third international hit single, reaching No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, and No. 6 in New Zealand. The album also spawned two more UK top 10 hits, &quot;Wide Boy&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, as it went multi-platinum. During this time, Kershaw toured extensively with his backing band the Krew, consisting of Keith Airey, Tim Moore, Mark Price and Dennis Smith.

In July 1985, Kershaw was among the performers at Live Aid, held at Wembley Stadium. He described the experience as &quot;absolutely terrifying&quot;. The concert turned out to be the peak of his career, as his stardom began to wane soon afterwards and he enjoyed only one more UK top 40 hit with &quot;When a Heart Beats&quot;. He continued to record and release records and collaborated with others on a number of projects, including playing guitar on Elton John&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Nikita&quot;.

A cover version of &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be Good&quot; by the Danny Hutton Hitters appeared on the soundtrack of the 1986 teen romantic comedy drama film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. Later that same year, Kershaw&#x27;s third solo studio album, &quot;Radio Musicola&quot;, was released to critical acclaim but to little commercial success. &quot;The Works&quot; was released in 1989, also to little success. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; and &quot;Elisabeth&#x27;s Eyes&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
Kershaw&#x27;s prowess as a songwriter served him well in 1991, when his song &quot;The One and Only&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the British film &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Song&quot;, and in the American movie &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;. &quot;The One and Only&quot; proved to be a UK No. 1 hit for the star of &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Song&quot;, Chesney Hawkes.

During 1991, he worked with Tony Banks, the keyboardist of Genesis, on Banks&#x27; third solo studio album &quot;Still&quot;. Kershaw co-wrote two songs with Banks, providing lead vocals on both. He also sang on the Banks composition &quot;The Final Curtain&quot;.

In 1993, the Hollies had a minor hit with another of Kershaw&#x27;s songs, &quot;The Woman I Love&quot;. During the mid-1990s he also wrote and produced material for the boy band Let Loose, with two of the tracks (&quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Everybody Say Everybody Do&quot;) achieving reasonable success. Following this year, Kershaw appeared on Elton John&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Duets&quot; studio album, where Kershaw not only wrote the song but produced, and played all the instruments on the track.

The year 1999 saw the release of his fifth studio album, &quot;15 Minutes&quot;. Kershaw decided to record the tracks himself, when he could not envisage them being recorded by other artists. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Somebody Loves You&quot; and &quot;What Do You Think of It So Far?&quot;, the latter a song described as &quot;an elegant and soaring ode to the transience of time, infused with both self-doubt and an acceptance of life that can only come with maturity&quot;.

=== 2000–present ===

The follow-up studio album, &quot;To Be Frank&quot;, was released in 2001. Over the years, Kershaw has collaborated on albums with artists such as Elton John, Bonnie Tyler, Sia and Gary Barlow.

In 2005, Kershaw released &quot;Then and Now&quot;, a collection of earlier material with four new tracks. In 2006, he completed another solo studio album, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Laugh&quot;, available only through his website or digitally through iTunes. This album contained twelve tracks and was released on Kershaw&#x27;s own label, Shorthouse Records. Neither &quot;Then and Now&quot; nor &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Laugh&quot; was promoted by a tour. The year also saw the digital re-release of his 1980s back catalogue including &quot;Human Racing&quot;, &quot;The Riddle&quot;, &quot;Radio Musicola&quot; and &quot;The Works&quot;.

In August 2009, Kershaw performed at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention and the Rewind Festival on Temple Island Meadows at Henley-on-Thames.

On 13 May 2010, Kershaw appeared on stage and hosted &quot;Our Friends Acoustic&quot; in aid of Mencap. He performed &quot;The Riddle&quot;, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot;, &quot;Dancing Girls&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;. Other 1980s performers joined him and performed their own songs, including Howard Jones, Andy Bell of Erasure, Carol Decker of T&#x27;Pau and Jimmy Somerville of Bronski Beat and the Communards at The O2 in London.

Kershaw wrote songs and performed for the soundtrack of the 2010 film, &quot;Round Ireland with a Fridge&quot; by Tony Hawks. He wrote and sang the theme song, &quot;If It Gets Much Better Than This&quot;. He also appeared as an extra in the penultimate scene, presenting a copy of the book to Hawks for signing in the book shop.

Following the release of his eighth studio album in 2012 (&quot;Ei8ht&quot;, his first release to reach the UK Albums Chart since 1986), Kershaw undertook a small tour of the UK, with some European dates. As part of each show he played the entirety of his debut studio album, which had been re-mastered and re-released in March 2012.

In 2012, Kershaw was featured as the lead vocalist on a new recording of &quot;The Lamia&quot;, originally recorded by Genesis for their studio album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974), with Steve Hackett for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Genesis Revisited II&quot; studio album. He is also featured as a guest performer on the same song on Hackett&#x27;s &quot;Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith&quot; CD and DVD, released November 2013.

Kershaw performed a solo acoustic set at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention in August 2013. He was on tour in the UK and Ireland in Autumn 2014. He continues to perform at 1980s revival events and festivals each year. In the latter part of 2015 he performed a 31-date tour of the UK, on a double bill with Go West, supported by Carol Decker of T&#x27;Pau.

On 11 November 2016, Kershaw performed in Reykjavík, Iceland, together with the pop rock band Todmobile. He joined them after a short set of eight songs and played guitar on three Todmobile songs.

In June 2020, Kershaw released an extended play (EP) of six new songs, &quot;These Little Things&quot;. &quot;Oxymoron&quot; is Kershaw&#x27;s most recent full studio album, which was released in October 2020. It features 16 songs, which were recorded at Abbey Road Studios.

In 2024, Kershaw went on a co-headlining tour with Go West in Australia.

== Personal life ==
Kershaw&#x27;s first wife was Canadian Sheri Pogmore, herself a musician who featured on several of Kershaw&#x27;s early studio albums. The couple married in July 1983, had three children together, and divorced in 2003. Their second son was born with Down syndrome. Kershaw remarried in 2009 and has also had a child with his second wife Sarah.

In 2019, Kershaw received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Suffolk for his services to the music industry.

<text>Jason Morgan Ritter (born February 17, 1980) is an American actor. The son of John Ritter and Nancy Morgan, he is known for his work in television series such as &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; (2012–2016), &quot;Another Period&quot; (2015–2018), &quot;Kevin (Probably) Saves the World&quot; (2017–2018), and &quot;Raising Dion&quot; (2019–2022), and &quot;Matlock&quot; (2024–). For his portrayal of Mark Cyr on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Parenthood&quot; (2010–2014), Ritter was nominated for the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor. 

Ritter made his feature film debut with a supporting role in &quot;Mumford&quot; (1999). His other credits include &quot;Swimfan&quot; (2002), &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003), &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; (2004), &quot;Happy Endings&quot; (2005), &quot;The Education of Charlie Banks&quot; (2007), &quot;W.&quot; (2008), &quot;The Perfect Family&quot; (2011), &quot;Wild Canaries&quot; (2014), &quot;The Meddler&quot; (2015), &quot;Carrie Pilby&quot; (2016), &quot;Bitch&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Tale&quot; (2018). He also voiced the character of Ryder in &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019). Ritter is married to actress Melanie Lynskey, with whom he has a daughter.

==Early life==
Ritter was born on February 17, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, to actors Nancy Morgan and John Ritter. He is a grandson of actors Tex Ritter, who died six years before Ritter was born, and Dorothy Fay. His stepmother is actress Amy Yasbeck. Ritter has three siblings, including actor Tyler Ritter.

Ritter appeared as a toddler in the opening credits of his father&#x27;s show, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; with Joyce DeWitt who played Janet. His appearance was unplanned, but the producers liked the added touch, and kept it.

He attended middle and high school at the Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California, with Simon Helberg, who became his roommate at NYU. Ritter attended and graduated from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied at the Atlantic Theater Company. He later studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

==Career==

=== 1990–2007: Teen films and early career ===
Ritter made his professional acting debut at age 10, playing Harry Neal Baum in the 1990 television film &quot;The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story&quot;. Several years later, he had a supporting role as Martin Brockett in the 1999 film &quot;Mumford&quot;, a dramedy directed by Lawrence Kasdan.

Ritter&#x27;s film work throughout the early 2000s included prominent parts in teen-oriented projects such as &quot;Swimfan&quot; (2002), &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003), and &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; (2004). Between 2003 and 2005, he appeared as Kevin Girardi, the disabled brother of the titular main character, on the CBS family drama series &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. Next, he played a young man struggling to come terms with his sexuality in the dark comedy &quot;Happy Endings&quot; (2005), with Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commenting, &quot;The acting in this ensemble is of such a high order that the movie simply takes you in and makes you feel these lives as real&quot;.

Ritter&#x27;s portrayal of an Ivy League college student in &quot;The Education of Charlie Banks&quot; (2007) was met with critical acclaim: &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; referred to it as a &quot;head-turner&quot; performance that combined &quot;a believably brooding intensity with a bad boy swagger that brings to mind [a] young Matt Dillon&quot;.

=== 2008–2016: Independent film roles ===

Following a supporting role in the satirical 2008 comedy &quot;The Deal&quot;, Ritter appeared briefly as Jeb Bush in the biographical drama &quot;W&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone. On preparing for the role, he said, &quot;I watched everything that I possibly could and read some books about [the] Bush family [and] Jeb&quot;. That same year, he produced and starred in the independent dramedy &quot;Good Dick&quot; with his girlfriend at the time, Marianna Palka, making her directorial debut. A look at the relationship between an introverted girl (Palka) and the video store assistant (Ritter) vying for her attention, the film drew a mixed reception, but &quot;Empire&quot;″s Anna Smith was enthusiastic in her appraisal: &quot;Ritter&#x27;s character — a romantic reformed druggie — is one to root for, and [the film] entertains enough to get by, marking Palka and Ritter as talents to watch&quot;.

In 2010, Ritter began playing the recurring role of Mark Cyr on NBC&#x27;s
&quot;Parenthood&quot;. The performance earned him a nomination for the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. His next project was the 2011 independent comedy &quot;A Bag of Hammers&quot;, where he starred as a felon who winds up taking care of a neglected child; in a mixed review, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that its tone was &quot;muddled&quot;, but believed it &quot;starts off strong, offering funny, well timed dialogue between Sandvig [and] Ritter&quot;. Also that year, he co-starred in &quot;The Perfect Family&quot;, which critic Frank Scheck felt worked solely on the strength of its performances: &quot;Turner is deeply sympathetic as the religious matriarch ... while Ritter and Deschanel are thoroughly believable as the grown children who love their mother despite her oft-expressed disapproval of their actions&quot;.

Between 2012 and 2016, Ritter starred in the voice role of Dipper Pines on the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, a show about a pair of twins deciphering the weird goings-on in the mysterious titular town. The series was universally praised, with Alasdair Wilkins of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; calling it &quot;funny, emotional, beautiful, and terrifying in equal measure&quot;. Ritter had prominent parts in five independent features between 2012 and 2013: &quot;The End of Love&quot;, &quot;Free Samples&quot;, &quot;I Am I&quot;, &quot;The Big Ask&quot;, and &quot;The East&quot;. It was announced in February 2013 that he would star as Gavin in &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot;, a sitcom pilot based on the British television comedy &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;. While subsequently picked up as a series by Fox, &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot; was cancelled before it could premiere, with the show&#x27;s seven episodes eventually being released by Crackle.

Ritter&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Wild Canaries&quot; (2014), a throwback to classic whodunits, was met with praise: Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;eventful, plot-driven [and] fun&quot;, adding that &quot;Corrigan and especially Ritter are solid in their hefty supporting roles&quot;. He headlined the independent drama &quot;About Alex&quot; that same year, playing a young man who finds solace in a group of old friends after attempting to take his own life. In his review for &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;, Brian Tallerico said, &quot;What&#x27;s kind of refreshing about &quot;About Alex&quot; is that the predictable map through the clichés of this subgenre that seems to be charted in the opening scenes isn&#x27;t quite followed&quot;, adding, &quot;Ritter finds [the] emotional undercurrent that&#x27;s often missing from these troubled characters. There&#x27;s something honest in the way his voice quivers that makes his depression seem more genuine&quot;.

Ritter had a supporting role as the ex-boyfriend of main character Lori in the 2015 comedy-drama &quot;The Meddler&quot;, and began playing Lord Frederick Bellacourt—an illiterate twin—that same year on the acclaimed historical sitcom &quot;Another Period&quot;, a parody of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. In their review of the latter, which ran for three seasons on Comedy Central, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that Ritter brought &quot;an earnestness&quot; to the wacky material. Next, he starred as a man suffering from retrograde amnesia in the post-apocalyptic drama &quot;Embers&quot; (2015); &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critic Anton Bitel called it &quot;a reflection of the human condition as philosophically compelling as it is emotionally intelligent&quot;, adding, &quot;No film has either moved or provoked me as much this year&quot;. In 2016, Ritter co-starred in the well-reviewed ensemble comedy &quot;The Intervention&quot; and received positive notices for his role in &quot;Carrie Pilby&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name.

=== 2017–present: Television and film work ===

In the satirical dark comedy &quot;Bitch&quot; (2017), Ritter re-teamed with director Marianna Palka to play Bill, a promiscuous husband whose wife suddenly takes on the mannerisms of a wild dog. Writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, Erick Kohn said, &quot;The usually sweet-natured Ritter boldly plays against type ... an &quot;American Psycho&quot;-like creep ... leaving the care of his three young children to his clearly unstable wife&quot;, adding that &quot;[the film] works best when it focuses on Bill&#x27;s ongoing shock at the sudden demand for his responsibility, as he fights through the task of delivering his kids to school and suddenly loses traction in the workplace. A fierce portrait of unwieldy comeuppance, it&#x27;s both hilarious and terrifying to watch Bill take in the strange events around him&quot;.

Ritter&#x27;s portrayal of Kevin Finn—a depressed financial worker tasked with preventing humanity from self-destruction—in &quot;Kevin (Probably) Saves the World&quot; was warmly received by critics. The show ran for a single season on ABC between October 2017 and March 2018. Next, he appeared in &quot;The Tale&quot; (2018), a drama based on the childhood sexual abuse suffered by Jennifer Fox—the film&#x27;s writer and director—at the hands of her running coach. Ritter played perpetrator William &quot;Bill&quot; Allens, earning strong reviews for his performance: &quot;Ritter has never been better&quot; said Matt Goldberg of &quot;Collider&quot;, while &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s David Sims commented, &quot;Handed the tough roles of mentors who shift into monsters, Ritter and Debicki subtly calibrate their performances as necessary, projecting a protective edge in one moment and a predatory one in the next. Their transformations are extraordinary to watch, and necessary to reckon with&quot;. Ritter said the experience of making the film had been a challenging one, and that there were times after a day&#x27;s shooting when he &quot;had to go home and let it all out&quot;.

In 2019, Ritter played the voice role of Ryder—a member of the Northuldra tribe—in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Frozen II&quot;, which broke box office records upon its release. He began starring as biotech engineer Pat Rollins on the critically acclaimed superhero series &quot;Raising Dion&quot; the same year, with Aaron Pruner of &quot;Thrillist&quot; commenting that Ritter&#x27;s involvement &quot;adds the nuanced character work he&#x27;s known for&quot;. The show ran for two seasons on Netflix before being cancelled in April 2022.

In a casting choice that drew attention for being &quot;meta&quot;, Ritter appeared as Deputy Denny Reese in two episodes of the true crime Hulu miniseries &quot;Candy&quot; (2022), where the character—along with his colleague, played by Justin Timberlake—investigates the 1980 murder of Texan housewife Betty Gore. Gore was portrayed by Ritter&#x27;s wife, Melanie Lynskey, while the perpetrator—Candy Montgomery—was played by Timberlake&#x27;s wife, Jessica Biel. The following year, Ritter voiced principal character Jonathan Fall in the animated series &quot;Captain Fall&quot;, a dark comedy that ran for one season on Netflix.

It was announced in March 2023 that Ritter had been cast in the CBS reboot of &quot;Matlock&quot;, which began airing in 2024.

==Personal life==
From October 1999 to 2013, Ritter was in a relationship with Marianna Palka. They met while they were both studying at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City. In 2017, Ritter became engaged to New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey after four years of dating. The couple had their first child, a daughter, in December 2018. They wed in 2020.

Speaking in 2010 about the death of his father, Ritter said, &quot;I think it helped me realize how fragile we all are. At the end of the day, you can be a health freak or a body builder, but a truck might hit you. Or you might be a huge, larger than life personality and it could all be taken away in the next second. I learned to tell people in my life how I feel about them a little bit more.&quot;

Ritter has been open about his struggle with alcoholism, and how his relationship with Lynskey gave him the strength to get sober: &quot;I thought she would be incredible for someone who deserved her, basically,&quot; he said in 2023. &quot;And I didn&#x27;t feel like I was that person ... It was only after [a] year into not drinking where I started to go, &#x27;Oh, maybe I can promise some things to someone else. Maybe I can be this person&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Richard Austen Butler, Baron Butler of Saffron Walden (9 December 1902 – 8 March 1982), also known as R. A. Butler and familiarly known from his initials as Rab, was a prominent British Conservative Party politician; he was effectively deputy prime minister to Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan, although he only held the official title for a brief period in 1962–63. He was one of his party&#x27;s leaders in promoting the post-war consensus through which the major parties largely agreed on the main points of domestic policy until the 1970s; it is sometimes known as &quot;Butskellism&quot; from a fusion of his name with that of his Labour counterpart, Hugh Gaitskell.

Born into a family of academics and Indian administrators, Butler had a distinguished academic career before he entered Parliament in 1929. As a junior minister, he helped to pass the Government of India Act 1935. He strongly supported the appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938 to 1939.

Entering the Cabinet in 1941, he served as President of the Board of Education (1941–1945) and oversaw the Education Act 1944. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1951–1955), Home Secretary (1957–1962), First Secretary of State (1962–1963) and Foreign Secretary (1963–1964). Butler had an exceptionally long ministerial career and was one of only two British politicians (the other being John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon) to have served in three of the four Great Offices of State but never to have been prime minister for which he was passed over in 1957 and 1963. At the time, the Conservative leadership was decided by a process of private consultation, rather than by a formal vote.

After retiring from politics in 1965, Butler was appointed Master of Trinity College, Cambridge and served until 1978. He died of colon cancer in 1982.

==Family background==
Butler&#x27;s paternal family had a long and distinguished association with the University of Cambridge, dating back to his great-grandfather George Butler. His great-uncle Henry Montagu Butler was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Dean of Gloucester, and his uncle Sir Geoffrey G. Butler, a Cambridge historian and Conservative MP for the university. His father was a Fellow and later Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

Butler&#x27;s maternal grandfather, George Smith, was Principal of Doveton Boys College, Calcutta.

==Early life and education==
Richard Austen Butler was born 9 December 1902 in Attock, British India, the eldest son of Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler, a member of the Indian Civil Service, and Anne Smith. He had two sisters, Iris (1905–2002), who married Lieutenant-Colonel Gervase Portal (1890–1961) and became a writer, and Dorothy (1909–1999), the wife of Laurence Middleton (1905–1982). His younger brother John (1914–1943) was killed in an air crash on active service in January 1943.
In July 1909, at the age of six, Butler&#x27;s right arm was broken in three places in a riding accident, which left his right hand permanently disabled. He attended a preparatory school in Hove but rebelled against going to Harrow School, where most of his family were educated. Having failed to win a scholarship to Eton College, he instead attended Marlborough College, leaving in December 1920.

In June 1921, Butler won an exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge. At that stage, he planned a career in the Diplomatic Service. He entered Pembroke College in October of that year and became President of the Cambridge Union Society for Easter (summer) term of 1924. Initially studying French and German, he graduated in 1925 with one of the highest first-class degrees in history in the university. He was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and gave lectures on the politics of the French Third Republic. At Cambridge, he met Sydney Courtauld; after they married in 1926, his father-in-law awarded him an income of £5,000 a year after tax for life, which was comparable to a Cabinet Minister&#x27;s salary and gave him the financial freedom to pursue a political career.

==Early political career==
With the help of his Courtauld family connections, Butler was selected unopposed as the Conservative candidate for Saffron Walden on 26 November 1927. He was elected in the 1929 general election, and retained the seat until his retirement in 1965.

Even before being elected to Parliament, Butler had been private secretary to Samuel Hoare. When the National Government was formed in August 1931 Hoare was appointed Secretary of State for India, and Butler was appointed as Hoare&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS). In January 1932, he visited India as part of Lord Lothian&#x27;s Franchise Committee, which was set up by the Round Table Conference and which recommended a large increase in the Indian electorate.

On 29 September 1932, Butler became Under-Secretary of State for India after the resignation of Lord Lothian and other Liberals over abandonment of free trade by the National Government. At 29, he was the youngest member of the government and was responsible for piloting the Government of India Act 1935 through Parliament in the face of massive opposition from Winston Churchill and the Conservative right. He retained this position in Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s third government (1935–1937), and when Neville Chamberlain replaced Baldwin as prime minister in May 1937, Butler was appointed Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Labour.

==Foreign Office; 1938 to 1941==
In the reshuffle caused by the resignation of Anthony Eden as Foreign Secretary and Lord Cranborne as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in February 1938, they were replaced by Lord Halifax and Butler, who became the main Foreign Office spokesman in the Commons.

In internal discussions after Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria on 12 March 1938, Butler counselled against giving Czechoslovakia a guarantee of British support and approved the Cabinet decision on 22 March not to do so, facts that he later omitted from his memoirs. During the Sudeten Crisis, he was attending a League of Nations meeting in Geneva but strongly supported Chamberlain&#x27;s trip to Berchtesgaden on 16 September, even if it meant sacrificing Czechoslovakia in the interests of peace. Butler returned to Britain to make the winding-up speech for the Government in the Parliamentary Debate on the Munich Agreement on 5 October. After Churchill had spoken, Butler said that war solved nothing and that it was better to &quot;settle our differences with Germany by consultation&quot;. However, he did not directly defend the Munich settlement; the motion was to support the avoidance of war and the pursuit of lasting peace.

Butler became a Privy Counsellor in the 1939 New Year Honours list, the youngest person so appointed since Churchill in 1907.

===After Prague===
After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939, Butler, like Chamberlain, was shocked at Hitler&#x27;s duplicity in breaking the Munich Agreement. The evidence suggests Butler did not support Halifax&#x27;s new policy of attempting to deter further German aggression by pledging to go to war to defend Poland and other Eastern European countries.

Butler became a member of the foreign policy committee, which agreed to seek an Anglo-Soviet alliance in May 1939, contrary to Chamberlain&#x27;s and Butler&#x27;s wishes, but Butler and Horace Wilson persuaded Chamberlain to hamstring the search for an agreement by including a requirement that Britain would not fight without League of Nations approval. Throughout the summer of 1939 Butler continued to lobby for closer Anglo-German relations and for Britain to lean on Poland to reach agreement with Germany.

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was announced on 23 August 1939, Butler vainly advised against honouring Britain&#x27;s guarantee to defend Poland against Germany but instead favoured Hitler&#x27;s proposal to allow Germany to settle matters with Poland as it wished and, in return for concessions over her former colonies, to sign an Anglo-German alliance. Oliver Harvey recorded (27 August) that Butler and Horace Wilson were &quot;working like beavers&quot; for &quot;another Munich&quot;.

As late as early September 1939, with German invasion of Poland imminent, comments in Channon&#x27;s diary suggest that Butler was sympathetic to last-minute Italian efforts to broker peace and that he and Butler were heartened by the delay in the British declaration of war on Germany caused by lack of agreement with the French over timing.

===Foreign Office Minister: later views and Butler&#x27;s memoirs===
Butler&#x27;s close association with appeasement was often held against him later in his career. Although he later held many senior Cabinet positions, by the time of Suez in 1956, his past, coupled with his lack of personal military experience, damaged his reputation in the eyes of the younger generation of Conservative MPs, many of whom were Second World War veterans. At the time, Butler strongly supported reaching agreement with Hitler as necessary for peace, but in his memoirs, &quot;The Art of the Possible&quot; (1971), he defended the Munich Agreement as essential to buy time to rearm and gain public support for war in Britain and the Dominions, and he also claimed that he had little input into foreign policy.

Later commentators argue that Butler&#x27;s suggestion in his memoirs that he supported Halifax in leading the drive away from appeasement after Prague is &quot;wholly false&quot;. His own papers suggest that he went to &quot;greater lengths to meet Hitler&#x27;s demands than any other figure in the British government&quot; in 1939. His efforts to revoke the Polish guarantee that summer went beyond even Horace Wilson&#x27;s, and it seems doubtful whether he was willing to fight Hitler over Poland at all. Patrick Cosgrave argues, &quot;Butler did not merely go along with appeasement he waxed hard, long and enthusiastic for it, and there is very little evidence... he took the slightest interest in the rearmament programme to which he devotes such emphasis in his memoirs&quot;. Jago concludes that Butler &quot;distorted the facts&quot; and &quot;grossly misrepresented his responsibility and attitudes in 1938&quot;. Although not the direct cause of his defeats [for the party leadership] in 1957 or 1963 &quot;it was... always there, the blemish that he could not quite reason away&quot;.

===Phoney War===
On 20 October 1939, after the Fall of Poland, Butler was, according to Soviet Ambassador Ivan Maisky, still open to a compromise peace and agreement to restore Germany&#x27;s colonies if it was guaranteed by all the powers, including the Americans and the Soviets. He dismissed as an &quot;absurdity&quot; any suggestion for Germany first to be required to withdraw from Poland. Butler disapproved of Churchill, the new First Lord of the Admiralty who publicly opposed to any hint of compromise peace.

Butler was quicker than many to realise the social change which war would bring. He spoke to Robert Barrington-Ward of &quot;The Times&quot; (12 February 1940) of &quot;the new social revolution that is making its way, and how to anticipate and meet it&quot;.

With Chamberlain&#x27;s position untenable after the Norway Debate, Butler tried on 10 May 1940 to persuade Halifax to accept appointment as prime minister, but he later stated that he was out at the dentist, and Churchill was appointed instead. Butler wrote to Chamberlain on 11 May to urge him to carry on as a member of the government in the hope of achieving a negotiated peace and was reappointed to the Foreign Office on 15 May. Butler later grew to respect Churchill after serving under him.

===Under Churchill and Prytz Affair===
On 17 June 1940, the day that Marshal Philippe Petain asked for an armistice, Butler met informally with a Swedish envoy, Björn Prytz. Prytz later reported to Stockholm that Butler had declared British policy must be determined by &quot;common sense not bravado&quot; and that had &quot;assured me that no opportunity for reaching a compromise (peace) would be neglected&quot; if there were reasonable conditions.

Churchill was furious when he found out, probably through intelligence intercepts of Swedish diplomatic cables. He wrote to Halifax on 26 June complaining of Butler&#x27;s &quot;odd language&quot;, which hinted at a lukewarm or even defeatist attitude. Butler, who was lucky not to be sacked, made a four-page handwritten reply the same day that claimed that he had kept to the official British line and had said &quot;nothing definite or specific that I would wish to withdraw&quot;, but he offered to resign. On 28 June, after being shown Churchill&#x27;s letter, Butler wrote to Halifax and have an unconvincing explanation, which he later repeated in his memoirs, that by &quot;common sense not bravado&quot;, he had been pushing the official line that there could be no peace until Germany had disgorged its conquests. Jago argues that Butler may have been covering for Halifax. Halifax&#x27;s biographer Andrew Roberts believes that Butler had been putting words into the mouth of Halifax, who had already moved away from his earlier openness to a compromise peace.

Butler kept his position and was allowed to make two broadcasts on the BBC (21 October and 15 December 1940). At the reshuffle on Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation from the government (22 October 1940), Churchill&#x27;s close supporter Brendan Bracken offered Butler promotion to the Cabinet-level job of President of the Board of Education, but no offer was forthcoming from Churchill.

Butler had little respect for Eden but reluctantly agreed to remain at the Foreign Office when he once again became Foreign Secretary in December 1940. In March 1941, with Eden in Cairo, Churchill handled Foreign Office business personally instead of delegating it to Butler. By then, Butler&#x27;s responsibilities had been restricted to &quot;routine drudgery&quot; such as negotiating safe passage for diplomats; repatriation of neutral seamen; and, on one occasion, arranging extra clothing coupons for foreign diplomats so that the Duke of Alba could buy more socks. Butler and Geoffrey Lloyd attempted to register for military service in May 1941, but their application was referred to Ernest Bevin (Minister of Labour), who, in turn, referred it to Churchill. He vetoed it on the grounds that their work as government ministers was more important.

==Education minister==

Butler gained permanent fame for the Education Act of 1944. Butler&#x27;s decisive role was to secure passage by negotiations with interested parties from Churchill to the churches and from educators to MPs.

===Background===
In July 1941, Butler was appointed President of the Board of Education, his first Cabinet post. Some writers, such as Addison, suggest that Education was a backwater and that Churchill offered him it or a diplomatic post to remove him from the more sensitive Foreign Office. However, he had been keen to leave the Foreign Office. Michael Jago argues that the promotion was not, contrary to Butler&#x27;s own later insinuations, intended as an insult.

Butler proved to be one of the most radical reforming ministers on the home front. The main problem standing in the way of education reform was the question of integrating church schools into the state system, which had bedevilled Balfour&#x27;s Act in 1902. Churchill did not want a new bill and replied that &quot;we cannot have party politics in wartime&quot;. Churchill warned him not to &quot;raise the 1902 controversy during the war&quot;. Butler later wrote that having seen the Promised Land, &quot;I was damned if I was going to die in the Land of Moab. Basing myself on long experience of Churchill over the India Bill, I decided to disregard what he said and go straight ahead&quot;.

===Negotiation with the churches===
More than half the schools in the country were church schools. Many church schools were in a poor state of repair. In a meeting on 5 June 1942 with the National Society, the body of Church of England schools, Butler proposed that Church schools could choose either to be 50% aided or fully funded with a local education authority majority on the school governing body. Archbishop Temple agreed to persuade his flock to accept the deal and later obtained the concession that denominational teachers could be allowed in fully-controlled schools if parents so wished. In early October 1942, Butler sold his scheme to the Nonconformist leaders of England and Wales.

Butler had less success in his dealings with the Roman Catholic Church. He was not able to have talks with the elderly Cardinal Arthur Hinsley until September 1942. Butler was told that his plans for 50% aided status were not acceptable to the Roman Catholic Church on 15 September 1942. Butler thought it better to present the Catholic Church with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Plans for 1943 were scuppered by a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; from Hinsley stressing Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s commitment to freedom of conscience and arguing that Catholic schools should not be bullied by the state, as they often provided for the poorest inner-city communities.

Serious thought was given to integrating public (fee-paying) schools into the state system. Butler was supportive and believed that standards would be raised in state schools if affluent and articulate parents were involved in the system. The Fleming Commission, assembled by Butler, recommended in July 1944 for a quarter of public school places to be given to scholarships. However, nothing came of it, not least as the idea of spending ratepayers&#x27; money on a few bright pupils often did not meet with local authority approval.

===1942–1945===
With Churchill&#x27;s leadership being questioned after recent reverses in the Far East and North Africa, Ivor Bulmer-Thomas (14 August 1942) commented that some Conservative MPs saw Butler, rather than Eden, as a potential successor. In late November 1942, Butler toyed with the idea of allowing himself to be considered for the job of Viceroy of India (in succession to Lord Linlithgow). Eden had been offered the position by Churchill and was seriously considering accepting it. In the end, Field Marshal Wavell was appointed. Butler helped to write King George VI&#x27;s Christmas broadcast at the end of 1942.

Butler lobbied John Anderson, Kingsley Wood and Ernest Bevin for an education bill in 1943, and by the end of 1942, a draft White paper was proceeding through the Lord President&#x27;s Committee. By March 1943, with an Allied victory seeming only a matter of time, Churchill began to support an education bill in 1944 and was aware that he needed to promise postwar improvements and that reforming schools would be cheaper than implementing the Beveridge Report. When the White Paper was published on 16 July 1943, church-state relations received the least attention.

The resulting bill became the Education Act 1944 and is often known as the &quot;Butler Act&quot;. It brought in free secondary education; until then, many grammar schools charged for entry, albeit with local authority assistance for poorer pupils in recent years. The Act expanded nursery provision and raised the school leaving age to 15, with a commitment to raise it further to 16 (not implemented until 1972).

At the second reading in March 1944, Thelma Cazalet-Keir, part of Quintin Hogg&#x27;s Tory Reform Committee, proposed two amendments, one to raise the school leaving age to 16 by 1951 and another demanding equal pay for women teachers. The latter passed by one vote on 28 March 1944. This was the only time the Coalition suffered a significant defeat in a division. Churchill made the amendment a matter of confidence and ensured its defeat on 30 March. This was one of the events which made Churchill and the Conservatives appear reactionary and contributed to their election defeat in 1945. The Butler Act became law in August 1944.

With party politics restarting, Butler opposed the nationalisation of iron and steel on 9 April 1945. After the end of the European War in May, Butler was Minister of Labour for two months in the Churchill caretaker ministry. In the Labour landslide of July 1945 he held Saffron Walden narrowly, his majority falling to 1,158. He would probably not have held the seat if the Liberal candidate had not polled over 3,000 votes and split the opposition vote.

==In opposition==
After the Conservatives were defeated in the 1945 general election, Butler emerged as the most prominent figure in the rebuilding of the party. He became Chairman of the Conservative Research Department, assisted by David Clarke and Michael Fraser. In 1946, he became chairman of the Industrial Policy Committee. In 1947, the Industrial Charter was produced, which advocated full employment and acceptance of the welfare state.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
When the Conservative Party returned to power in 1951, Butler was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the absence of other candidates, Oliver Lyttleton being seen as too close to the City of London. He inherited a balance of payments crisis that was partially caused by the increase in defence spending as a result of the Korean War. Butler initially planned to let the pound float (which would in practice devalue it) and become partially convertible (&quot;Operation ROBOT&quot;). The latter was struck down by Lord Cherwell and his adviser Donald MacDougall, who prepared a paper for Churchill. The counterargument was that the balance of payments would have worsened, as any reduction in demand for imports would have been swamped by the rise in prices of imported goods. Furthermore, 90% of other countries&#x27; sterling balances, kept in London, were to be frozen. They too would effectively have been devalued, which would have angered Commonwealth countries, would have broken the rules for the International Monetary Fund and would not have been allowed under the new European Payments Union. He was also opposed by his junior minister, Arthur Salter, while Lord Woolton insisted Eden should be involved since the policy would affect foreign relations. Eden opposed it in a rare intervention in domestic politics. It was finally buried at two Cabinets, on 28 and 29 February 1952.

Butler followed to a large extent the economic policies of his Labour predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, by pursuing a mixed economy and Keynesian economics as part of the post-war political consensus. The name &quot;Butskellism&quot;, referring to the generally similar economic policies pursued by both Conservative and Labour governments, was coined partly in response to Butler&#x27;s extension of Gaitskell&#x27;s NHS charges in 1952, the issue over which Aneurin Bevan and other Labour left-wingers had resigned in April 1951. In 1954, &quot;The Economist&quot; published an editorial headed &quot;Mr Butskell&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, which referred to the &quot;already... well-known figure&quot; Mr Butskell as &quot;a composite of the present Chancellor and the previous one&quot;. However, Butler had more interest in monetary policy and in convertibility, whereas Gaitskell was more inclined to exchange controls, investment and planning.

Butler maintained import controls and began a more active monetary policy. In the March 1952 budget, he raised the official bank rate to 4%, cut food subsidies by 40%, reduced taxes and increased pensions and welfare payments, the cumulative effect being to increase foreign exchange reserves but depress domestic demand. His 1953 budget cut income tax and purchase tax and promised an end to the excess profits levy. When Churchill suffered a stroke in the summer of 1953, an illness that was concealed from the public, Butler acted as head of the Government since Churchill&#x27;s presumed successor, Eden, was in the United States having medical treatment. Between 29 June and 18 August 1953, Butler chaired sixteen Cabinet meetings. In July, Macmillan recorded a conversation with Walter Monckton, who was willing to serve under Eden but not Butler, whom he considered &quot;a slab of cold fish&quot;.

Britain&#x27;s economic problems were worsened by Monckton&#x27;s appeasement of the trade unions (the 1954 rail strike was settled on the union&#x27;s terms with Churchill&#x27;s backing) and by Macmillan&#x27;s drive to build 300,000 houses a year.

Butler was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1954. He supported Churchill&#x27;s proposal for Eden to take &quot;command of the Home Front&quot; in summer 1954, not least as he hoped to succeed Eden as foreign secretary. Butler was one of the ministers who demanded to Churchill&#x27;s face (22 December 1954) that he set a date for his retirement.

==Under Eden==
===Move from the Exchequer===
Butler&#x27;s political judgement was affected by the death of his first wife, Sydney, on 9 December 1954. In February 1955, he increased the bank rate and restored hire purchase restrictions, and the 1955 budget reduced income tax by 6d, which was allegedly based on faulty Treasury statistics. In April, Anthony Eden succeeded Churchill as prime minister. After the Conservatives won the May 1955 general election, Butler declined a request he move from the Exchequer and later admitted that was a mistake. In an unfortunate speech on 18 October, he commented that the country must not sink into &quot;easy evenings with port wine and over-ripe pheasant&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; commented that he had &quot;dropped his silver spoon upon the polished floor&quot;. By now, it was apparent that the economy was &quot;overheating&quot; since inflation and the balance of payments deficit were rising sharply. The Cabinet refused to agree to cut bread subsidies, and there was a run on the pound. His final budget in October 1955 reversed several of the measures from the spring budget, which led to charges of electoral opportunism. Hugh Gaitskell accused him of having deliberately misled the electorate, which amused Macmillan, who wrote in his diary of how Butler was always talking of &quot;honour&quot; in Cabinet. The introduction of purchase tax on kitchen utensils caused it to be labelled the &quot;Pots and Pans&quot; budget. Macmillan was already negotiating with Eden for Butler&#x27;s job.

In December 1955, Butler was moved to the post of Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons. Although he continued to act as a deputy for Eden on a number of occasions, he was not officially recognised as such, and his successor as chancellor, Harold Macmillan, insisted on an assurance from Eden that Butler was not senior to him. Harry Crookshank warned that he was committing &quot;political suicide&quot; by giving up a big department. He recorded that after December 1955 that &quot;it was never again said of me, or for that matter of the British economy either, that we had &quot;la puissance d&#x27;une idée en marche&quot;&quot;. 

Butler suffered from what his biographer calls an &quot;inability to take Eden wholly seriously&quot;. A number of his sardonic witticisms about Eden, who was already subject to press criticism, surfaced, and &quot;The Sunday People&quot; reported on 8 January 1956 that Eden was to resign and hand over the premiership to Butler. When it was officially denied, on 9 January, Butler told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he was determined to &quot;support the Prime Minister in all his difficulties&quot; and that Eden was &quot;the best Prime Minister we have&quot;.

Butler threatened resignation in March 1956 over Macmillan&#x27;s plans to reverse the 6d cut in income tax. Macmillan himself then threatened resignation unless he was allowed to make spending cuts instead. Butler also served as Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1956 to 1959.

===Suez===
Butler was ill when Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal and was not formally a member of the Cabinet Egypt Committee. Butler later claimed that he had tried to keep Eden &quot;in a political straitjacket&quot; and advocated an open invasion of Egypt. Gilmour wrote that this would have attracted even more international opprobrium than Eden&#x27;s pretence of enforcing international law.

Butler seemed to be doubtful of Eden&#x27;s Suez policy but never said so openly. Macmillan recorded on 24 August that Butler was &quot;uncertain&quot; and &quot;wanted more time&quot; before resorting to force. On 13 September, he recorded that Butler preferred to refer the matter to the UN, as Labour and the churches wanted. After the UN voted for an emergency force and an Israeli-Egyptian ceasefire seemed imminent, Butler tried to have the Anglo-French invasion halted. He ended up pleasing neither those who were opposed to the invasion nor those who supported it. 

On the evening of 6 November 1956, after the British ceasefire had been announced, Butler was observed to be &quot;smiling broadly&quot; on the front bench and astonished some Conservatives by saying that he &quot;would not hesitate to convey&quot; to the absent prime minister the concerns expressed by Gaitskell. Eden&#x27;s press secretary, William Clark, an opponent of the policy, complained, &quot;God how power corrupts. The way RAB has turned and trimmed&quot;. He later resigned, along with Edward Boyle (Economic Secretary to the Treasury), as soon as the fighting was over. Butler was seen as disloyal because he aired his doubts freely in private while he was supporting the government in public, and he later admitted that he should have resigned. On 14 November, Butler blurted out all that had happened to 20 Conservative MPs of the Progress Trust in a Commons Dining Room (his speech was described by Gilmour as &quot;almost suicidally imprudent&quot;).

Butler had to announce British withdrawal from the Canal Zone (22 November), which made him once again appear an &quot;appeaser&quot; to Conservative supporters up and down the country. That evening, Butler addressed the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, where his pedestrian defence of government policy was upstaged by a speech by Macmillan.

Butler was seen to be an indecisive leader who was not up to Macmillan&#x27;s stature. However, the Press Association were briefed that Rab was &quot;in effective charge&quot; during Eden&#x27;s absence in Jamaica from 23 November. Eden was not in telephone contact and did not return to Britain until 14 December.

Shadow Chancellor Harold Wilson said that Butler had &quot;the look of a born loser&quot; (20 December). Butler spent most of his Christmas break shooting. He later recorded that during his period as acting Head of Government at Number 10, he had noticed constant comings and goings of ministers to Macmillan&#x27;s study in Number 11, next door, and that those who attended all later received promotion when Macmillan became prime minister. Butler, unlike Macmillan, preferred the assessments of the Chief Whip (Edward Heath) and Chairman of the Party (Oliver Poole), who believed that Eden could survive as prime minister until the summer recess if his health held up.

However, there is circumstantial evidence that Butler may have colluded with Eden&#x27;s doctor, Sir Horace Evans, to exaggerate the state of Eden&#x27;s health to encourage him to resign. Evans wrote Butler an ambiguous letter about &quot;your help and guidance over my difficult problems with AE&quot; and added, &quot;Here we have made, I have no doubt, the right decision&quot;. Anthony Howard observes that any interpretation of the letter is &quot;purely speculative&quot; and that there is &quot;no concrete evidence&quot; of what actually occurred.

===Succession to Eden===
Eden resigned as prime minister on Wednesday 9 January 1957. At the time, the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for determining a new leader, but Queen Elizabeth II received overwhelming advice to appoint Macmillan as prime minister instead of Butler, rather than wait for a party meeting to decide. Churchill had reservations about both candidates but later admitted that he had advised her to appoint &quot;the older man&quot;, Macmillan. In the presence of Lord Chancellor Kilmuir, Lord Salisbury interviewed the Cabinet one by one and with his famous speech impediment asked each one whether he was for &quot;Wab or Hawold&quot;. Kilmuir recalled that three ministers were for Butler: Walter Monckton, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn and James Stuart, all of whom left the government thereafter. Salisbury himself later recorded that all of the Cabinet were for Macmillan except for Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who was for Butler, and Selwyn Lloyd, who abstained. Salisbury may not have been an entirely impartial returning officer, as Butler had replaced Salisbury (Lord Cranborne as he had been at the time) as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in 1938, who when the latter had resigned over policy towards Italy. Julian Amery, who was not a member of the Cabinet at the time, alleged that Salisbury interviewed ministers in the order of their loyalty to Macmillan and kept the tally in plain view on the table so that waverers would be more inclined to plump for the winning candidate.

Heath (Chief Whip) and John Morrison (Chairman of the 1922 Committee) advised that the Suez group of right-wing Conservative backbenchers would be reluctant to follow Rab. The whips rang Boothby (pro-Macmillan) in Strasbourg to obtain his views, but there is no evidence that they were very assiduous in canvassing known pro-Butler MPs.

Butler later claimed to have been &quot;not surprised&quot; not to be chosen in 1957. In fact, he appears to have fully expected to be appointed and aroused his sister&#x27;s misgivings by asking, &quot;What shall I say in my broadcast to the nation tomorrow?&quot; Heath, who brought him the news that he had not been chosen, later wrote that he appeared &quot;utterly dumbfounded&quot; and that for years afterwards, he was known to ask colleagues why he had been passed over. Heath suggests that caused a loss of confidence, which prevented him from gaining the premiership in 1963. The media were taken by surprise by the choice, but Butler confessed in his memoirs that there was a sizeable anti-Butler faction on the backbenches, but there was no such anti-Macmillan faction. Butler spoke bitterly the next day about &quot;our beloved Monarch&quot;.

Butler attributed his defeat to Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;ambience&quot; and &quot;connections&quot;. He said &quot;savage&quot; things to Derek Marks of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, who protected Butler&#x27;s reputation by not printing them and years later told Alistair Horne, Macmillan&#x27;s biographer that he &quot;could not understand&quot; why he had been passed over after &quot;picking up the pieces&quot; after Suez. Nigel Nicolson, who had conceded that &quot;in the circumstances&quot;, Macmillan was the right choice, wrote of the &quot;melancholy that right had not triumphed&quot; with which Butler proposed Macmillan as leader at the party meeting on 22 January.

In Gilmour&#x27;s view, Butler did not organise a leadership campaign in 1957 because he had expected Eden to hang on until Easter or summer. Campbell wrote, &quot;The succession was sewn up before Rab even realised there was a contest&quot;. Richard Crossman wrote in his diary (11 January), &quot;This whole operation has been conducted from the top by a very few people with great speed and skill, so that Butler was outflanked and compelled to surrender almost as quickly as the Egyptians at Sinai&quot;. Brendan Bracken wrote that besides his perceived stance of pursuing Labour policies, the &quot;audience (was) tired of&quot; Butler who had been the heir apparent for too long, an analysis that is echoed by Campbell, who likens Macmillan&#x27;s sudden emergence after a quick succession of senior jobs to that of John Major in 1989–1990 and points out that like Major, Macmillan pretended to be &quot;right wing&quot; to win the leadership despite having views similar to his opponent&#x27;s.

==Under Macmillan==
===Home Office===
Butler had to accept the Home Office under Macmillan, not the Foreign Office, which he wanted. In his memoirs, Macmillan claimed that Butler &quot;chose&quot; the Home Office, an assertion of which Butler drily observed in his own memoirs that Macmillan&#x27;s memory &quot;played him false&quot;. Heath corroborates Butler&#x27;s claim that he had wanted the Foreign Office and suggested that with his &quot;quiet charm&quot;, he could have won over the Americans. Butler also remained Leader of the House of Commons.

In early 1958, he was left &quot;holding the baby&quot;, as he put it, after Macmillan had departed on a Commonwealth tour after the resignation of Chancellor Thorneycroft and the Treasury team.

Butler held the Home Office for five years, but his liberal views on hanging and flogging did little to endear him to rank-and-file Conservative members. He later wrote of &quot;Colonel Blimps of both sexes – and the female of the species was more deadly, politically, than the male&quot;. Butler later wrote that Macmillan, who kept a tight grip on foreign and economic policies, had given him &quot;a completely free hand&quot; in Home Office matters, which may well have been, in Gilmour&#x27;s view, because reform was likely to blacken Butler in the eyes of Conservative activists. Macmillan&#x27;s official biographer believes that Butler simply had no interest in home affairs. Butler later said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t deal with Eden, but I could deal with Mac&quot;.

Butler inherited a Homicide Bill, which introduced different degrees of murder. He had privately come to favour abolition of hanging but signed off on the execution of James Hanratty, which was thought at the time to be a miscarriage of justice. He declined to reintroduce corporal punishment, according to the recommendation of the prewar Cadogan Report. 

Butler gave a very successful speech at the Conservative Conference in 1959. Despite the recommendations of the Wolfenden Report, he could not decriminalise homosexual acts between consenting adults (that would not happen until 1967), but the Conservatives were more willing to implement Wolfenden&#x27;s recommended crackdown on street prostitution. He passed the Licensing Act 1961 and reformed the law on obscene publications. The Betting and Gaming Act legalised betting.

Annual immigration from the Indian subcontinent had risen from 21,000 in 1959 to 136,000 in 1961. Butler introduced the first curbs on immigration although the Eden Cabinet had contemplated measures in 1955. It was initially opposed by Labour, but the party brought in stricter curbs when it returned to office.

Enoch Powell praised Butler&#x27;s performance as a great reforming Home Secretary. He recalled that if Butler was absent from his post as Chairman of the Cabinet Home Affairs Committee, it was if the government itself &quot;came to a standstill&quot;.

===Other Cabinet positions===
Besides the Home Office, Butler held other senior government jobs in these years. He likened himself to the Gilbert and Sullivan character &quot;Pooh Bah&quot;. In October 1959, after that year&#x27;s general election, he was appointed Conservative Party chairman, which required him to attack Labour in the country, but as Leader of the House, he had to co-operate with Labour in the Commons. His new position prompted an analogy, described as &quot;ludicrous&quot; by Anthony Howard, in &quot;The Economist&quot; with Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s rise to power through control of the Soviet Communist Party.

In 1960, Macmillan moved Selwyn Lloyd from the Foreign Office to the Exchequer by telling him that it would put him in a good position to challenge Butler for the succession. He appointed Lord Home as Foreign Secretary, refused again to appoint Butler and told him that it would be &quot;like Herbert Morrison&quot; if he took the position. That was &quot;fantastically insulting&quot; in Campbell&#x27;s view, as Morrison was then regarded as &quot;the worst Foreign Secretary in living memory&quot;. Butler disagreed with the analysis but accepted it, enabling Macmillan to claim once again that he had declined the Foreign Office. Butler declined to accept Home&#x27;s old place as Commonwealth Secretary.

In the October 1961 reshuffle, Butler lost the party chairmanship to Iain Macleod, who also insisted on getting the job of Leader of the House, which Butler had held since 1955. Butler retained the Home Office and declined Macmillan&#x27;s suggestion to accept a peerage. Butler gave an excellent party conference speech in October 1961. In March 1962, Butler was made head of the newly-created Central African Department. Butler was, however, given oversight of the EEC entry negotiations, which he strongly supported despite worries about the agricultural vote in his constituency. A cartoon showed Macmillan and Butler as the miserable emigrating couple in Ford Madox Brown&#x27;s painting &quot;The Last of England&quot;.

Butler helped to precipitate Macmillan&#x27;s brutal &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; reshuffle by leaking to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 11 July 1962 that a major reshuffle was imminent. He referred to it as the &quot;Massacre of Glencoe&quot;. Macmillan later told Selwyn Lloyd on 1 August that he thought Butler had been planning to split the party over entry to the European Economic Community. In the reshuffle, Butler lost the Home Office although he kept the Central Africa Department. He also became the inaugural First Secretary of State, a position that was created partly to avoid the earlier constitutional objections to that of Deputy Prime Minister. However, he continued to act as a deputy for Macmillan, as he had earlier for Eden as well, including for six weeks during Macmillan&#x27;s 1958 tour of the Commonwealth.

Macmillan allegedly told Butler that he was the most likely successor as prime minister, but Macmillan used the opportunity to promote younger men, who might provide an alternative. They included Lord Hailsham, who was given the task of negotiating the Test Ban Treaty; Reginald Maudling, who was appointed chancellor; and Edward Heath, who oversaw the EEC entry negotiations; he hoped to groom one of them as an alternative successor.

==Succession to Macmillan==
===Profumo, peerages and Africa===

Butler told Tony Benn in February 1963 that he expected Macmillan to stay on and fight the next general election, which could occur no later than 1964. During the crisis caused by Profumo affair, Butler was asked by Martin Redmayne, the Conservative Chief Whip, and Lord Poole, Party Chairman, if he would in principle serve in a Maudling government. He was also visited by Maudling, the two men agreeing to serve under each other if necessary. Since Butler was technically his senior, Maudling believed that gave him an advantage. It was reported that the Cabinet generally backed Butler, but backbench MPs supported Maudling.

On 16 July, the Lords amended the Peerage Bill, which was then passing through Parliament, so that any existing peer could disclaim his peerage within twelve months of the bill becoming law, not after the next general election, as originally planned. The Peerage Act 1963 received Royal Assent on 31 July, which allowed Lords Hailsham and Home to become potential candidates for the succession.

By mid-1963, Butler had largely come to believe (or so he alleged in a 1966 interview) that he was probably too old for the leadership and that when Macmillan resigned, the position would go to a younger man. This may explain why Butler did not put up much of a fight for the leadership that autumn, although in fact Home, the eventually successful candidate, was almost exactly the same age as Butler, and both men were substantially younger than Macmillan himself had been when he first entered 10 Downing Street.

In the summer of 1963, Macmillan told Lord Hailsham, &quot;Rab simply doesn&#x27;t have it in him to be Prime Minister&quot;. Just before Butler departed for the Victoria Falls Conference in July 1963, John Morrison, still Chairman of the 1922 Committee, told him bluntly to his face: &quot;The chaps won&#x27;t have you&quot;.

At the Victoria Falls Conference, Butler dissolved the Central African Federation. The following year, the Nyasaland Protectorate became independent as Malawi and Northern Rhodesia as Zambia; Southern Rhodesia declared unilateral independence from Britain in 1965.

===Conference and customary processes===
In October 1963, Macmillan, having just decided to stay on and to lead the party into the next general election, was taken ill on the eve of the Conservative Party Conference. Butler insisted on occupying the leader&#x27;s suite at the Imperial Hotel and on delivering the leader&#x27;s speech on the final day (12 October). During the conference, Lord Home announced that Macmillan was to resign as prime minister. In the confusion of the next few days, Hailsham campaigned openly for the job in a manner that was considered vulgar. Butler, Home and their wives lunched together on Saturday 12 October. Home said that he would be seeing his doctor that week and so hinted that he might be about to put his name forward for the leadership. Butler&#x27;s speech, when he delivered it, was an attempt to update the postwar Charters to modern politics, and he reprinted some of the speech verbatim in his memoirs. However, his delivery was, in Heath&#x27;s later description, &quot;monotonous and ineffective and did him no good whatever&quot;. Howard described it as &quot;flat and uninspiring&quot;, and Peregrine Worsthorne wrote at the time that he spoke in a &quot;limp and faltering voice&quot;. Butler later called the Imperial &quot;that awful hotel&quot; and refused to visit Blackpool ever again.

Back in London, Macmillan, from his hospital bed, proposed on 14 October a four-track consultation to &quot;take soundings&quot; (of the opinions of Cabinet, MPs, peers and leading members of the party organisation in the country) and to select a consensus leader through the &quot;customary processes&quot;. The Cabinet met and was chaired by Butler on 15 October, and approved the plan, which was to be completed by 17 October. Howard argues that Butler should also have insisted that the Cabinet meet again on 17 October to approve the &quot;results&quot; of the soundings.

Selwyn Lloyd visited Macmillan in hospital on 16 October and argued against Butler, who he said was much disliked in the constituency associations &quot;particularly the Women. Why that is, no one seems to know&quot;. Current ministers who visited Macmillan in hospital included Duncan Sandys, who advised for Home not as a compromise but on his own merits, and Edward Heath who felt that Butler would be uninspiring and had not emerged as a natural and undisputed successor in the way that he should have. Other ministers thought either Butler or Home to be suitable. Edward Boyle later felt he had been too favourable to the idea of a Home leadership, which led to him being wrongly recorded as a Home supporter. Sitting at the Cabinet table on 16 October during the soundings, Butler said &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening&quot; before adding &quot;but I do really&quot;. When asked what he would do if once again not appointed prime minister, he replied, &quot;I shall behave with dignity&quot;.

===Results of the consultations===
Much ink has been spilled on how badly the consultation process was rigged, but Macmillan recommended the outside candidate Lord Home for the premiership.

Lord Chancellor Dilhorne had already begun polling the Cabinet at the Blackpool Conference and claimed that not counting Macmillan or Home, 10 were for Home (including Boyle and Macleod, both of whom later insisted that they supported Butler), 4 for Maudling (originally 3, amended to 5 and then down to 4), 3 for Butler and 2 for Hailsham. In a review of Horne&#x27;s &quot;Life of Macmillan&quot; published in the London Review of Books in 1989, Gilmour argued that Dilhorne falsified the figures a claim that was repeated in 2004. Dilhorne recorded Hailsham as saying that he could &quot;not&quot; serve under Butler. Hailsham in fact claimed that he &quot;had&quot; offered to serve under Butler if necessary. Frederick Errol, President of the Board of Trade, had been told by Chief Whip Martin Redmayne at Blackpool that the succession had been already arranged for Home, as had John Boyd-Carpenter, a Butler supporter, on 9 October.

Redmayne&#x27;s whips had also begun polling MPs and junior ministers at Blackpool and claimed that 87 supported Home and 86 Butler, another claim that was ridiculed by Ian Gilmour, and 65 MPs were found to be for Hailsham, 48 for Maudling, 12 for Macleod and 10 for Edward Heath, with Home being well ahead on second preferences. Despite denials by the whips, Redmayne let slip in a radio interview (19 December 1963, subsequently published in &quot;The Listener&quot;) about the four questions they asked: namely, their first and second preferences as leader, whether or not there was any candidate whom they especially &quot;opposed&quot; and whether they would in principle accept Home as leader. Humphry Berkeley refused to answer the &quot;hypothetical question&quot; of whether he would support Home as compromise between Butler and Hailsham. Jim Prior (then a backbencher) and Willie Whitelaw (then a junior minister) later recalled how they felt the whips were pushing Home&#x27;s candidacy. Prior&#x27;s first choice was Maudling and second Butler, and he opposed Hailsham but suspected that he had been recorded as pro-Home after repeated pushing on the fourth question. Whitelaw thought the fourth question &quot;improper&quot;.

Amongst Conservative peers, Home led Butler by 2 to 1. The constituency parties, in so far as their views could be ascertained, were reported as being 60% for Hailsham and 40% for Butler, with strong opposition to both. They had not really been offered Home as a candidate, but it was reported that they would &quot;rally round him&quot;.

===The &quot;Quad&quot; rebel===
The results of the consultation became known to the rest of the Cabinet around lunchtime on 17 October. Powell, Macleod, Hailsham and Maudling (known as &quot;the Quad&quot; in some accounts of the following days) were outraged and sought to persuade Butler to refuse to serve under Home in the belief that it would make a Home premiership impossible and result in Butler taking office. Macleod and Maudling demanded that Dilhorne lay the results of his consultations before the Cabinet, but he refused to do so. Butler was not present at the meetings (17 October) at 5pm at Macleod&#x27;s flat and that night at Powell&#x27;s house during which Maudling agreed to serve under Butler. Hailsham, who was at a separate gathering but keeping in touch with Powell&#x27;s house by telephone, also agreed to serve under Butler. He telephoned Butler and repeated his answers aloud to the room as if he were a barrister &quot;leading&quot; a slow witness (Butler said that he had been &quot;dozing off&quot; and ended the conversation by repeating that he was off to do so) before telling him &quot;you must put on your armour, dear Rab&quot;. The &quot;Quad&quot; summoned Martin Redmayne, who stood firm against their demands. They demanded that he pass on their concerns to the Palace. Then, Lord Aldington, who had also been at the meeting, drove Redmayne back and telephoned Sir Michael Adeane, the Queen&#x27;s Private Secretary, to make sure the message was passed on.

Powell, a wartime brigadier, observed that they had given Butler a loaded revolver, which he had refused to use on the grounds that it might make a noise. Macleod commented that they had put the &quot;golden ball in his lap, if he drops it now it&#x27;s his own fault&quot;. 

&quot;The Times&quot; wrote of Butler on Friday morning (18 October) that &quot;he always looks as if he will be the next Prime Minister until it seems that the throne may actually be vacant&quot;. Macmillan finally resigned that morning, the Queen calling on him in hospital shortly afterwards to receive his written &quot;advice&quot;. He had likened the &quot;Quad&quot; to the Fox-North Coalition and had to urge Home, who had agreed to stand only as a compromise candidate, not to withdraw. Butler called Dilhorne the same morning to demand a meeting of the three main candidates (Butler, Home and Maudling) before the succession was resolved; &quot;no reply was vouchsafed&quot;, as Butler put it. Butler, Macleod, Hailsham and Maudling met at the Treasury on 18 October as Home was at the Palace, accepting the Queen&#x27;s invitation to &quot; try&quot; to form a government.

Butler was pushing for a two-way meeting with Home, but he should, in Howard&#x27;s view, have insisted on Home confronting the &quot;Quad&quot;. Home immediately moved into Number 10 and interviewed Butler then Maudling early in the afternoon. Butler did not at first agree to serve, as he had reservations about whether Home, a peer and not a moderniser, was a suitable prime minister. Hailsham, Butler and Maudling finally met Home that evening after dinner, by which time Hailsham was already wavering and expressing a willingness to serve under Home. Butler&#x27;s old friend, Geoffrey Lloyd, sat up with him until 3am on the morning of Saturday 19 October, telling him that &quot;if you&#x27;re not prepared to put everything to the touch, you don&#x27;t deserve to be Prime Minister&quot;.

===Butler agrees to serve===
The next morning (19 October), Butler and then Maudling agreed to serve under Home, who returned to the Palace to report that he could &quot;form a government&quot; and to &quot;kiss hands&quot;, i.e. formally accept appointment as prime minister. The Queen is thought to have privately preferred Home, whom she knew well socially, to Butler, although that did not influence the decision. The Palace knew that Home could not form a government without Butler serving, although Home himself later said that he could have formed a government without Butler but not without Maudling.

Some, including Macmillan, argued that Butler&#x27;s vacillation was further proof of his unfitness to be prime minister. Lord Poole commented that &quot;if you had seen him yesterday morning, dithering about in a gutless sort of way, you would not want him to be Prime Minister of this country. I was quite appalled, quite disgusted&quot;.

Butler later alleged in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that not to have served might have led to a Labour government; the suggestion was later dismissed as absurd by Wilson himself. Butler later described Home as an &quot;amiable enough creature&quot;. He was motivated by his knowledge of Robert Peel and the split over the Corn Laws. He later told Elizabeth Longford that it was &quot;the supremely unforgettable political lesson of history... I could never do the same thing in the twentieth century, under any circumstances whatever&quot;.

Powell and Macleod refused to serve under Home. Butler had planned to make Macleod Chancellor of the Exchequer and discussed the names of economists who could be asked to advise.

Butler was less devastated than in 1957, as this time, it was largely a voluntary abnegation. In a BBC radio interview in 1978, he discussed that in 1963, he had been passed over in favour of a &quot;terrific gent&quot;, not a &quot;most ghastly walrus&quot;. Home and even Macmillan himself in the 1980s later conceded that it might have been better if Butler had become leader. The episode of Home&#x27;s elevation was a public relations disaster for the Conservatives, who decided to elect their next leader (Edward Heath in 1965) by a transparent ballot of MPs.

==Foreign Secretary under Douglas-Home==
Home appointed Butler Foreign Secretary but he lost the title of deputy prime minister. Macmillan, trying to control events from his sickbed, had urged Home to appoint Heath as Foreign Secretary but conceded that allowing Butler to have the position that he had always coveted might be a necessary price for his agreeing to serve.

Macleod&#x27;s article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; of 17 January 1964 in which he claimed that the leadership had been stitched up by a &quot;Magic Circle&quot; of Old Etonians damaged Macleod in the eyes of Conservatives, but some of the damage stuck to Butler as well. Butler later wrote in &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; that &quot;every word&quot; of Macleod&#x27;s &quot;Spectator&quot; article &quot;[wa]s true&quot;.

Butler was able to speak fluent French to French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville to the latter&#x27;s surprise. Butler&#x27;s only major foreign trip was to Washington in late March 1964, where US President Lyndon Johnson complained about the sale of British-made buses to Castro-controlled Cuba, which was under a US trade embargo.

Butler played only a small part in the 1964 general election campaign. He showed his lack of stomach for the fight by agreeing with the journalist George Gale of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; that the very close campaign &quot;might yet slip away&quot; in the &quot;last few days&quot;. Randolph Churchill wrote that he had &quot;uttered his own death-wish and death warrant&quot;. He would not have retained the Foreign Office if the Conservatives had won. The job had already been promised to Christopher Soames. Many, including Wilson, said that Butler would have won the 1964 general election if he had been prime minister.

At the comparatively early age of 61, Butler left office with one of the longest records of ministerial experience for contemporary politicians. After the election, he lost the chairmanship of the Conservative Research Department, which he had headed for 20 years, and refused Home&#x27;s offer of an earldom, a rank normally granted to former prime ministers at the time (Harold Macmillan, for example, refused a barony in 1964 but accepted an earldom in 1984).

==Later life==
===Master of Trinity and memoirs===
Butler remained on the Conservative front bench into the next year. Harold Wilson felt that the Conservatives had made Butler a scapegoat after the &quot;Daily Express&quot; incident during the election, and on 23 December 1964, Wilson offered him the job of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (where Butler&#x27;s great-uncle Henry Montagu Butler had previously been Master and the incumbent Lord Adrian was due to retire on 30 June 1965). Butler did not accept until the middle of January and took office at the start of the new academic year on 7 October 1965. On 19 February 1965, he was created a life peer as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden, &quot;of Halstead in the County of Essex&quot;; because of his appointment as master he sat as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords. Between the 1964 election and his retirement from the House of Commons, he had been Father of the House.

There was little consultation of Trinity fellows prior to Butler&#x27;s appointment, but his opponents had backed down in the face of public approval. Butler was the first master in 250 years who had not been himself educated at the college.

King Charles III, then Prince of Wales, studied at Trinity (1967–1970) during Butler&#x27;s time as Master. Initially it was thought that he might study an &quot;ad hoc&quot; course; a humorous cartoon showed Butler telling the Prince that he was to study a specially made-up history course &quot;in which I become Prime Minister&quot;. Instead Butler recommended that unlike previous members of the Royal Family, Prince Charles live in College, study for a normal degree and sit Finals like any other undergraduate. After initial reluctance, the Palace agreed. Butler was publicly promoted as a mentor and counsellor to the Prince by making himself available for a 45-minute time slot each evening before dinner if the Prince wished to seek his advice. He turned a blind eye to Prince Charles keeping a car in college (in breach of the rules) but exclaimed &quot;Hell no!&quot; when the Prince asked if he might join the Labour Club. Butler also gave Lucia Santa Cruz, his research assistant for his memoirs, a key to the Master&#x27;s Lodge and often let her stay, which gave rise to rumours that he was facilitating a romance between her and the Prince. Butler&#x27;s appointment to the Order of the Garter on 23 April 1971 was seen as a gesture of recognition for his guidance of the young Prince.

Butler soon earned respect by his brisk chairing of College Council Meetings, which was important because of Trinity College&#x27;s huge investments in land and businesses, which generated an income of £1 million per annum at the time. He was also a director of Courtaulds, the family company, at this time. By 1971, the fellows had warmed to him enough to vote recommending (successfully) that he be given a second six-year term, despite the normal retirement age for masters being seventy.

Butler&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Art of the Possible&quot;, appeared in 1971. He wrote that he had decided to &quot;eschew the current autobiographical fashion for multi-volume histories&quot;. (Macmillan was bringing out an autobiography, which would eventually run to six large volumes.) The work, largely ghosted by Peter Goldman, was described as the best single-volume autobiography since Duff Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Old Men Forget&quot; in 1953.

Butler was also active as the first Chancellor of the University of Essex from 1966 to his death and Chancellor of the University of Sheffield from 1959 to 1977. He was High Steward of Cambridge University from 1958 to 1966 and High Steward of the City of Cambridge from 1963 until his death.

===Second term at Trinity ===
From 1972 to 1975, Butler chaired the high-profile Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders, which was widely referred to as the Butler Committee and which proposed major reforms to the law and psychiatric services, some of which have been implemented.

By the early 1970s, Butler&#x27;s physical and mental powers were in unmistakable decline. He was, in the description of Charles Moore, then a student at Trinity, well into his &quot;anecdotage&quot;. He scaled back his public appearances after an incident at the Booker Prize awards in London in December 1973, at which he told ill-judged anti-Semitic jokes, which caused grave offence to the publisher George Weidenfeld.

As early as 1938, Chips Channon had called Butler&#x27;s clothes &quot;truly tragic&quot; and as he grew older, Butler acquired an ever more dishevelled appearance. He ate and drank copiously as Master of Trinity, which caused him to put on weight and to begin to suffer from heart problems. On a visit to Cambridge in 1975, the first time that the two men had met in a decade, Macmillan commented on how fat Butler had become. Butler also suffered from a skin complaint from the 1950s, which grew progressively worse to the point towards the end of his life, he would sometimes appear unshaven in public.

In June and October 1976, he spoke in the House of Lords against the planned nationalisation of Felixstowe Docks, owned by Trinity College. He argued that Trinity, which has had more Nobel Prize winners than the whole of France, spent the income on science research and on subsidising smaller Cambridge colleges. The bill was abandoned after it was delayed by the House of Lords.

Butler&#x27;s term as Master ended in 1978. Butler House at Trinity is named after him.

===Final years===
Butler published &quot;The Conservatives&quot; in 1977. His last speech in the House of Lords, in March 1980, was to defend the provision of free school buses, which he regarded as vital for Conservative support in rural areas. His last public appearance, by which time he was unwell and had to remain seated, was on 13 January 1982 at the unveiling of his portrait at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Butler died of colon cancer in March 1982 in Great Yeldham, Essex. He is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Saffron Walden (see image). His will was probated at £748,789 (21 October 1982) (over £2.3m at 2014 prices). His banner as Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter hangs in the church of St Mary&#x27;s, Saffron Walden (see image).

A further volume of memoirs, &quot;The Art of Memory&quot;, appeared posthumously in 1982; modelled on Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot;, Howard suggests that it matches his &quot;neither in verve nor anecdote&quot;. His son Adam Butler was an MP from 1970 to 1987 and a junior minister under Margaret Thatcher. His grandson Ed Butler is a retired Brigadier who commanded 16 Air Assault Brigade and 22 Special Air Service.

==Assessments==
Butler opened his memoirs by saying that his career had been split between academia, politics and India and that his main regret was never having been Viceroy of India. He regarded the India Act 1935 and the Education Act 1944 as his &quot;principal legislative achievements&quot;. He also wrote that the way to the top was through rebellion and resignation, but he had gone for &quot;the long haul&quot; and &quot;steady influence&quot;. In an obvious dig at Home, he said in retirement &quot;I may never have known much about fishing or flower-arranging, but one thing I did know was how to govern the people of this country&quot;.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1982 called him &quot;the creator of the modern educational system, the key-figure in the revival of post-war Conservatism, arguably the most successful chancellor since the war and unquestionably a Home Secretary of reforming zeal&quot;.

Along with the Education Act 1944 and Butler&#x27;s reforms as Home Secretary, John Campbell sees Butler&#x27;s greatest achievement as the &quot;redefine(ing of) the meaning of Conservatism&quot; in opposition by encouraging the careers of talented younger men at the Research Department (Heath, Powell, Maudling, Macleod and Angus Maude, all of whom entered Parliament in 1950), by ensuring Conservative acceptance of the welfare state and a commitment to keeping unemployment low. Macmillan acknowledged Butler&#x27;s role in his memoirs but stressed that those were the very policies that he had promoted in vain in the 1930s. Butler enjoyed 26.5 years in office, equalled only by Churchill in the twentieth century.

His biographer Michael Jago argues that the Latin tag which Butler applied to Eden, omnium consensu capax imperii nisi imperasset (&quot;by common consent fit to rule until he ruled&quot;), could have been applied just as accurately to Butler himself. While Butler was possibly the best chancellor since 1945, this was overshadowed by the disastrous budgets in 1955. Combined with Suez, these destroyed his chances of becoming prime minister even without Macmillan&#x27;s opposition in 1963; &quot;the coup de grace administered seven years later by Macmillan was posthumous&quot;. He also suggests Butler&#x27;s handling of the Central African Federation, despite his illness, suggests that he may have been &quot;the best Foreign Secretary Britain never had&quot;, but these qualities were negated by his chronic indecisiveness, often about petty matters. He argues that he was indecisive as chancellor, and recounts how during the Profumo Affair he once telephoned a junior civil servant to ask what he should do, as well as occasions on which he was unable to decide on the menu for an official lunch, or whether to attend a reception at the Moroccan Embassy.

Roy Jenkins, describing a stormy meeting that Butler had with Lyndon B. Johnson, pinpointed a tendency in Butler&#x27;s character in that &quot;while Butler represented the forces of urbane, civilised superiority and Johnson the raw brashness of the insecure &quot;arriviste&quot;, it was also the case that Butler was the natural servant of the state and LBJ the natural ruler&quot;. He noted that a similar dynamic was at work in Butler&#x27;s relations with the equally domineering Winston Churchill.

Edward Pearce wrote of his legislative record that &quot;Rab&#x27;s failure was more brilliant than most politicians&#x27; success&quot;.

Iain Macleod said of him that &quot;Rab loves being a politician among academics and an academic among politicians; that is why neither breed of man likes him all that much&quot;. Lobby correspondents (journalists who report on political affairs, including non-attributable information leaked to them) were advised never to believe anything that Butler told them but never to ignore anything he told them either. Ian Gilmour argues that Butler was always more popular in the country than in his own party and that he acquired an unjust reputation for deviousness, but was in fact less so than a number of his colleagues.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; praised him on his return to Cambridge in June 1965 but wrote that he had lacked the ruthless streak needed to get to the very top in politics. &quot;The Economist&quot; (27 June 1970) called him &quot;the last real policy-making Chancellor&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 20 April 1926, Butler married Sydney Elizabeth Courtauld (1902–1954), the daughter of Samuel Courtauld and co-heiress to the Courtaulds textile fortune. They had four children:
* Sir Richard Clive Butler (1929–2012), President of the National Farmer&#x27;s Union from 1979 to 1986;
* Sir Adam Cortauld Butler (1931–2008), also a politician, father of Brigadier Ed Butler (born 1960);
* Samuel James Butler (1936–2015), father of Fleur Butler (born 1967); and
* Sarah Teresa Butler (born 1944).

Sydney died of cancer in 1954, and in 1959, Butler married again, this time to Mollie Courtauld (1908–2009), who was the widow of Sydney&#x27;s cousin, Augustine Courtauld. They purchased Spencers, the house in Essex in which Mollie had lived with Augustine Courtauld. She remained there until her death on 18 February 2009, at the age of 101.

<doc id="331073" wikidata="Q920293" url="?curid=331073" title="Edward Gordon Craig">
<text>Edward Henry Gordon Craig (born Edward Godwin; 16 January 1872 – 29 July 1966), sometimes known as Gordon Craig, was an English modernist theatre practitioner; he worked as an actor, director and scenic designer, as well as developing an influential body of theoretical writings. Craig was the son of actress Dame Ellen Terry.

The Gordon Craig Theatre, built in Stevenage (the town of his birth), was named in his honour in 1975.

==Life and family==
The illegitimate son of the architect Edward Godwin and the actress Ellen Terry, Craig was born Edward Godwin on 16 January 1872 in Railway Street, Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, England, and baptised at age 16 as Edward Henry Gordon. He attended Bradfield College in Berkshire from May 1886 to July 1887. He took the surname Craig by deed poll at age 21.

Craig spent much of his childhood backstage at the Lyceum Theatre, where his mother was the leading lady to actor Sir Henry Irving. Craig later wrote a vivid, book-length tribute to Irving. Craig&#x27;s sister was Edith Craig.

In 1893 Craig married Helen Mary (May) Gibson, with whom he had five children: Philip Carlisle (born 1894), Rosemary Nell (born 1894), Henry Edward Robin (born 1895), John (born 1896) and Peter (born 1897).

He met Elena Meo, a violinist, daughter of artist Gaetano Meo, in 1900, and they had three children together: Ellen (1903–1904), Nell (1904–1975), and Edward (1905–1998). Craig lived with Elena Meo and their two surviving children on and off, in England and Italy. May Craig would not consent to a divorce until 1932, after Craig and Elena Meo had permanently separated. Craig fathered other illegitimate children: a daughter with actress Jess Dorynne, Kitty; a daughter with dancer Isadora Duncan, Deirdre Beatrice (1906–1913), who drowned at the age of seven with another of Duncan&#x27;s children, Patrick Augustus, and their nanny; a son, Davidino Lees (1916–2004), with poet Dorothy Nevile Lees, and a daughter, Daphne &#x27;Two Two&#x27; (1935-1995) with his secretary/translator Daphne Woodward.

Craig lived in straitened circumstances in France for much of his life and was interned by German Occupation forces in 1942. He died at Vence, France, in 1966, aged 94.

==Career==
Craig asserted that the director was &quot;the true artist of the theatre&quot; and, controversially, suggested viewing actors as no more important than marionettes. He designed and built elaborately symbolic sets; for instance, a set composed of his patented movable screens for the Moscow Art Theatre production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He was also the editor and chief writer for the first international theatre magazine, &quot;The Mask&quot;.

He worked as an actor in the company of Sir Henry Irving, but became more interested in art, learning to carve wood under the tutelage of James Pryde and William Nicholson. His acting career ended in 1897, when he went into theatrical design.

Craig&#x27;s first productions, Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (both inspired and conducted by his lifelong friend Martin Shaw, who founded the Purcell Operatic Society with him to produce them), and Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Vikings at Helgeland,&quot; were produced in London. The production of &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; was a considerable success and highly influential in reviving interest in the music of Purcell, then so little known that three copies of &quot;The Times&quot; review were delivered to the theatre: one addressed to Mr Shaw, one to Mr Craig, and one to Mr Purcell. Craig concentrated on keeping his designs simple, so as to set-off the movements of the actors and of light, and introduced the idea of a &quot;unified stage picture&quot; that covered all the elements of design.

After finding little financial success in Britain, Craig set out for Germany in 1904. While there, he wrote one of his most famous works, the essay &quot;The Art of the Theatre&quot; (later reprinted with the title &quot;On the Art of the Theatre&quot;). In 1908, Isadora Duncan introduced Craig to Konstantin Stanislavski, the founder of the Moscow Art Theatre, who invited him to direct their famous production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the company, which opened in December 1911. After settling in Italy, Craig created a school of theatrical design with support from Lord Howard de Walden, the Arena Goldoni in Florence. During World War I, he wrote a cycle of puppet plays, the &quot;Drama for Fools&quot; and published a little theatre magazine, &quot;The Marionnette&quot; (1918).

Craig was considered extremely difficult to work with and ultimately refused to direct or design any project over which he did not have complete artistic control. This led to his withdrawal from practical theatre production. His later career is remarkable for how little he achieved after the age of forty, during a long period of over fifty years. In 1929, Craig produced a remarkable series of woodcuts as illustrations for a special edition of Hamlet published by Count Harry Kessler in a German translation by Gerhardt Hauptmann, an English edition of which appeared the following year.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and in 1958 was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH).

==Pseudonyms==
While often working under his own name, Craig also signed work with a large number of other names, including Oliver Bath, Julius Oliver, Giulio Pirro, Samuel Prim, and Stanislas Lodochowskowski.

&quot;The Art Record&quot; noted in 1901 that Oliver Bath was &quot;a gentleman who is believed to subsist on an exclusive diet of the famous Bath Oliver Biscuit&quot;.

==Ideas==

Craig&#x27;s idea of using neutral, mobile, non-representational screens as a staging device is probably his most famous scenographic concept. In 1910 Craig filed a patent which described in considerable technical detail a system of hinged and fixed flats that could be quickly arranged to cater for both internal and external scenes. He presented a set to William Butler Yeats for use at the Abbey Theatre in Ireland, who shared his symbolist aesthetic.

Craig&#x27;s second innovation was in stage lighting. Doing away with traditional footlights, Craig lit the stage from above, placing lights in the ceiling of the theatre. Colour and light also became central to Craig&#x27;s stage conceptualizations.

Under the play of this light, the background becomes a deep shimmering blue, apparently almost translucent, upon which the green and purple make a harmony of great richness.

The third remarkable aspect of Craig&#x27;s experiments in theatrical form were his attempts to integrate design elements with his work with actors. His &quot;mise en scène&quot; sought to articulate the relationships in space between movement, sound, line, and colour. Craig promoted a theatre focused on the craft of the director – a theatre where action, words, colour and rhythm combine in dynamic dramatic form.
All of his life, Craig sought to capture &quot;pure emotion&quot; or &quot;arrested development&quot; in the plays on which he worked. Even during the years when he was not producing plays, Craig continued to make models, to conceive stage designs and to work on directorial plans that were never to reach performance. He believed that a director should approach a play with no preconceptions and he embraced this in his fading up from the minimum or blank canvas approach.

As an engraver and a classical artist, Craig found inspiration in puppets and masks. In his 1910 article &quot;A Note on Masks,&quot; Craig expounds the virtue of using masks as a mechanism for capturing the audience&#x27;s attention, imagination and soul. &quot;There is only one actor – nay one man who has the soul of the dramatic poet, and who has ever served as the true and loyal interpreter of the poet,&quot; he proclaimed, and &quot;this is the marionette.&quot;

&quot;On the Art of the Theatre&quot; (1911) is written as a dialogue between a Playgoer and a Stage Director, who examine the problems of the nature of stage directing. Craig argues that it was not dramatists, but rather performers who made the first works of drama, using action, words, line, colour and rhythm. Craig goes on to contend that only the director who seeks to interpret drama truly, and commits to training in all aspects of dramatic art, can restore the &quot;Art of the Theatre.&quot; Maintaining that the director should seek a faithful interpretation of the text, Craig argues that audiences go to the theatre to see, rather than to hear, plays. The design elements may transcend reality and function as symbols, he thought, thereby communicating a deeper meaning, rather than simply reflecting the real world.

On 29 June 1908 the Polish theater director, playwright, and theoretician of drama Leon Schiller initiated a correspondence with Craig. Together with his letter Schiller sent Craig, in Florence, his essay, &quot;Dwa teatry&quot; (&quot;Two Theaters&quot;), translated into English by Madeline Meager. Craig responded immediately, accepting the essay for his magazine, &quot;The Mask&quot;. This was the beginning of a productive collaboration between the two prominent theater directors, who introduced each other&#x27;s theoretical writings to foreign readers.

== Archives and legacy ==
Craig&#x27;s archive was purchased by Hans Posse on instructions from Adolf Hitler, for Hitler&#x27;s planned Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. The purchase price was nearly 2.4 million French francs.

One of the largest collections of Edward Gordon Craig&#x27;s papers is held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The 32-box collection includes Craig&#x27;s diaries, essays, reviews, notes, manuscripts, financial records, and correspondence. Over 130 personal photographs are present in the archive. The Ransom Center&#x27;s art holdings including some of Craig&#x27;s woodblocks from the Cranach Press &quot;Hamlet&quot; as well as proof prints made during production of the book. The center&#x27;s library holds over 300 books from Craig&#x27;s personal collection. In addition to the archive of Edward Gordon Craig, the Ransom Center holds important holdings relating to Craig&#x27;s mother Ellen Terry, as well as the archive of his son Edward Carrick.

A play by David Hare, to premiere in 2025 and starring Ralph Fiennes as Henry Irving, &quot;Grace Pervades&quot;, explores the life of Irving, Terry, Craig and his sister Edith.

<doc id="331074" wikidata="Q192873" url="?curid=331074" title="Dundee United F.C.">
<text>Dundee United Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in the city of Dundee. Formed in 1909, originally as Dundee Hibernian, the club changed to the present name in 1923. United are nicknamed &quot;The Terrors&quot; or &quot;The Tangerines&quot; and the supporters are known as &quot;Arabs&quot;.

The club have played in tangerine shirts mostly accompanied by black shorts since August 1969, and have played at Tannadice Park since the club&#x27;s foundation in 1909. United was a founding member of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) in 1998, and was ever-present in the competition until it was abolished in 2013 to make way for the SPFL structure. In recent years, United&#x27;s top flight status has wavered, having spent only six seasons in the Premiership since 2013–14. After winning the 2023–24 Scottish Championship they returned to the top flight for the 2024–25 season.

Domestically, the club has won the Scottish Premier Division on one occasion (1982–83), the Scottish Cup twice (1994 and 2010) and the Scottish League Cup twice (1979 and 1980). United appeared in European competition for the first time in the 1966–67 season, going on to appear in Europe in 14 successive seasons from 1976. They also reached the European Cup semi-finals in 1983–84 and the UEFA Cup final in 1987.

The club contest the Dundee derby with local rivals Dundee; this is the geographically closest derby in Britain, as Dens Park stadium is located virtually next door to Tannadice Park. Dundee United have won the local derby 81 times, Dundee have won it 49 times, and there have been 44 draws between the close rivals.

== History ==

=== Beginning (1909–1959) ===
The club was formed as Dundee Hibernian in 1909, playing from the outset at Tannadice Park (previously known as Clepington Park), named after the street it&#x27;s located on - Tannadice Street. They were voted into the Scottish Football League in 1910. After being saved from going out of business in October 1923, the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal. Between 1925 and 1932 United were promoted and relegated between the first and second tier three times, winning the Second Division title in 1925 and 1929.

=== Promotion to the top flight (1959–1971) ===
The club took significant strides forward when Jerry Kerr became manager in 1959. Kerr&#x27;s team won promotion in his first season in charge and became an established team in the top flight, where they remained until 1995.

A key characteristic of Kerr&#x27;s reign was the strengthening of the playing squad with Scandinavian imports, most notably with the signings of Lennart Wing, Finn Dossing, Mogens Berg, Finn Seemann and Orjan Persson.

It was during this period that United qualified for European competition for the first time, eliminating Inter-Cities Fairs Cup holders Barcelona on their European debut in 1966.

=== Jim McLean era (1971–1993) ===
Jim McLean took over from Kerr in 1971 and under his management the club enjoyed the most successful era in its history. McLean&#x27;s era became known for his youth policy and the offering of long-term contracts that would see future Scotland international players such as Dave Narey, Paul Sturrock, Paul Hegarty, Davie Dodds, Eamonn Bannon and Maurice Malpas spend the majority of their careers at the club.

United won their first major honour under McLean, capturing the Scottish League Cup in 1979 and again in 1980. They were crowned Premier Division champions in 1982–83.

The club were also successful in Europe, reaching the European Cup semi-finals in 1984 and the UEFA Cup Final in 1987, the latter campaign involving another elimination of Barcelona during the earlier rounds (maintaining a 100% record over the Spaniards in competitive European ties). Despite losing to IFK Gothenburg in the final, the club was awarded a FIFA Fair Play Award.

McLean retired as manager in 1993, but remained as club chairman.

=== Scottish Cup wins and relegation (1993–2016) ===

United won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1994 under McLean&#x27;s successor Ivan Golac, but were relegated in 1995, before returning to the Premier Division a year later.

Following a number of board changes, the club was purchased from McLean in 2002 by former Morning Noon and Night co-founder and chief executive Eddie Thompson. A lifelong United fan, Thompson invested heavily in the team in a bid to compete with significant spending which had developed following the formation of the Scottish Premier League, however little progress was made until Craig Levein became manager in 2006. Levein established United as a top six club, regularly achieving European qualification before he left the club to take the post as Scotland men&#x27;s national team manager in 2009.

With the foundations of the side in place, United won the Scottish Cup for a second time in 2010 under the management of Peter Houston.

After several relatively successful seasons, a series of poor results in the Premiership led to United being relegated in 2016.

=== Scottish Championship and promotion battles (2016–2020) ===
Dundee United&#x27;s first season in the Championship was under the management of Ray McKinnon. United won the Challenge Cup by beating St Mirren 2–1 in the final and they reached the play-off final for the Premiership. However they lost narrowly 1–0 to Hamilton. The second season in the second tier was less successful, as manager McKinnon was sacked and replaced with Csaba László; after a very disappointing season, United lost in the play-off semi-final to eventual promotion winners Livingston. After a poor start to the 2018–19 season the manager was once again sacked and replaced with Robbie Neilson. The team finished second in the Championship but lost in the play-offs to St Mirren, missing four penalty kicks in the process. United started the 2019–20 season in title winning form, maintaining the top spot since the opening weekend, but the season was postponed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic on 13 March 2020. On 15 April 2020, the SPFL plan proposing an end to the season was approved. A 14-point lead over second place Inverness CT saw United crowned champions and subsequently promoted back to the Premiership. On 21 June 2020, the club announced that they were parting ways with manager Robbie Neilson, who agreed a deal to return to newly relegated side Heart of Midlothian.

=== Scottish Premiership return (2020–2023) ===
Prior to the start of the Premiership season, Dundee United hired Tranmere Rovers manager Micky Mellon to replace Neilson, and began their campaign at home to Tayside rivals St Johnstone, drawing 1–1. In their first season back in the top flight United finished in 9th place, whilst also making a Scottish Cup semi final appearance, losing to Hibernian.

In May 2021 Mellon departed the club, being replaced on 7 June by Tam Courts. Courts first season as Dundee United manager saw the team finish 4th, their highest position since 2014, and qualify to play in the third qualification round of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League.

United were eliminated in the third qualification round by AZ Alkmaar after a 7–1 aggregate defeat, losing 7–0 away from home, equaling the record defeat for a Scottish club in European competition. They started the league season equally poorly, and were beaten 9–0 at home by Celtic on 28 August 2022. United continued to play poorly throughout the season, leading to the departure of two managers as the club faced an unexpected relegation battle. The first was Jack Ross, who was appointed as manager before the season - he was sacked after the 9–0 loss to Celtic. Ross was succeeded by Liam Fox, first on an interim basis and then as full-time head coach after a win against Livingston in the League Cup. Fox was in charge of the club until February where after a horror show against fellow relegation rivals Ross County United lost 4–0, resulting in the second managerial departure in the same season. The club turned to Jim Goodwin, who had himself been relieved from his role at Aberdeen in February, to save their season, appointing him along with long-time assistant Lee Sharp on a short-term deal until the end of the Premiership season. Goodwin led the club from being 5 points adrift at the foot of the table, and without a win in the league since January to losing only twice in seven matches, to 4 points above bottom side Ross County in the table into 10th ahead of Kilmarnock in 11th on goal difference. United entered the split knowing that a couple more victories would all but secure their top-flight status for another season but became only the second side to go a post-split campaign without picking up a single point and were consigned to relegation back to the Championship after a 3–2 loss away at Motherwell on the final day.

=== Relegation back to the Championship and immediate Premiership return (2023–present) ===
Just before United&#x27;s relegation was confirmed, Goodwin signed a 2-year deal to remain manager of United. Goodwin subsequently announced he will allow any player who wishes to leave the club to do so. United had a much changed side for their first competitive outing came in the League Cup group stage against The Spartans, who had just gained promotion from the Lowland League into the SPFL set up. The matchday squad contained only 9 players from the squad that lost to Motherwell two months prior. United suffered a shock 1–0 defeat at Ainslie Park before losing once again to Partick Thistle in their first home match in the group stage. United then went on an incredible run of form, winning 14 of their next 17 matches across all competitions without losing, so that after a 2–1 win away to Dunfermline United sat on top of the Championship, with 31 points from a possible 39.

It was not all smooth sailing for the Tangerines however, as they then fell out of the Challenge Cup at the quarter final stage to League One side Falkirk before then crashing out of the Scottish Cup at the first time of asking to another League One side in Queen of the South. United suffered their first defeat of the season against high flying Raith Rovers at Tannadice. Raith had been unbeaten in 6 consecutive matches before their victory meaning that despite only losing once United were second in the league and 5 points behind the Fife side.

United continued to pick up victories going into the new year, although draws against Queen&#x27;s Park and Dunfermline and a loss to Greenock Morton blemished United&#x27;s run. Raith led United by 4 points as they met once more at Stark&#x27;s Park. United once again fell victim to the Rovers - this time to an 89th minute wonder strike from Rovers&#x27; captain Scott Brown. The atmosphere at Tannadice was beginning to sour, as after a 2–0 home defeat to Airdrie the jeers and boos rained from the stands at the players and manager.

United managed to gain form towards the end of the season, after a near halfway line goal from Louis Moult against Inverness secured a draw to put the Tannadice side clear of Raith by 1 point. The next match was between the two title challengers and seemed likely to prove decisive in the race for promotion. United defeated Raith for the first time that season winning 2–0 to send United 4 clear at the top of the league, a position that they would not relinquish. United all but secured the Championship title and promotion back to the Premiership with a 1–0 win over Ayr United at Tannadice in April, putting them 6 points clear of Raith with two games to spare, with United&#x27;s goal difference 36 more than Rovers&#x27;. The title, and subsequent promotion, was officially confirmed after a 0–0 draw at Airdrie on 26 April 2024.

== Colours and badge ==

United&#x27;s playing kit consists of tangerine shirts and black shorts, first used when the team played under the Dallas Tornado moniker in the United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club&#x27;s own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image. The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre-season friendly against Everton in August.

When founded as Dundee Hibernian, they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts. By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923, the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to appeal to a wider cross-section of the community. These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including Celtic-style broad hoops, Queen&#x27;s Park-style narrow hoops and an Airdrie-style &quot;V&quot; motif.

The present club badge was introduced in 2022, and saw the previous lion rampant design updated in a new logo incorporating the club colours. To mark the club&#x27;s centenary in 2009, a special version of the badge with an added &quot;1909 2009 Centenary&quot; logo was introduced for the duration of the 2009–10 season, along with additional green trim on the badge, representing Dundee Hibernian&#x27;s colours.

Previously, the lion had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this &quot;classic&quot; version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players&#x27; strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge.

The club first introduced shirt sponsorship in the 1985–86 season when future chairman Eddie Thompson&#x27;s VG chain sponsored the club in the first of a two-year deal. A six-year association with Belhaven then ensued with a sponsorless 1993–94 season. Rover began a two-year deal early in time for the 1994 Scottish Cup final, sponsoring the club until the end of the 1995–96 season. Telewest took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson&#x27;s Morning, Noon and Night started sponsoring the club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when Anglian Home Improvements began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors. JD Sports&#x27; Carbrini Sportswear brand sponsored the club in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons. United&#x27;s shirt sponsor from the 2016–17 season was McEwan Fraser Legal, before Utilita took over the sponsorship from 2018 until 2021. United&#x27;s shirt sponsor was then Eden Mill, who took over before the 2021–22 season, followed by two one-year sponsorships from Quinn Casino and Bartercard. Their current shirt sponsor is Quinn Casino.

United have had a number of official kit suppliers, including Adidas, Hummel, Nike, Macron and most recently Erreà.

== Stadium ==
Dundee United&#x27;s home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Coldside area of the city. It is situated a mere away from Dens Park, home of rivals Dundee; The club has only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a League Cup tie against Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice Park unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens Park.

Tannadice is currently an all-seater with a capacity of . The Main Stand, built in 1962, was the first cantilever to be constructed at a Scottish football ground. For long periods of its history, only a small proportion of the ground contained seated accommodation. In the late 1980s the ground had 2,252 seats out of a total capacity of 22,310.

The comparative age and proximity of their stadiums has led to various discussions about the possibility of both Dundee clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium. The most recent proposal was put forward as part of Scotland&#x27;s bid to jointly host the UEFA Euro 2008 championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium. With planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park, special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland&#x27;s failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved, although it was resurrected in June 2008, following doubts about joint-host Ukraine&#x27;s ability to stage Euro 2012, and the SFA&#x27;s keenness to act as an alternative host.

In June 2024, Dundee United announced CalForth Construction as the stadium naming rights partner. As part of the agreement the stadium will be known as the CalForth Construction Arena at Tannadice Park until summer 2026.

===League Attendance===
The table below displays Dundee United&#x27;s league attendances since 2010.

The highest attendance in that period came on 30 August 2019 when United beat their city rivals Dundee 6–2 in front a 14,108 crowd, their largest league attendance since 1998. In the same season United also set their highest average attendance and highest low attendance of the decade, these records being set despite the club residing in the second tier of the Scottish Professional Football League at the time. The lowest attendance of the 2019–20 season was larger than the highest attendance of the previous year, likely due to United&#x27;s strong performance.

Due to United&#x27;s failure to gain promotion back to the Scottish Premiership over the previous seasons and growing mistrust of the club chairman and owner, 2018–19 saw the lowest average attendance of the decade. The lowest attendance was set the season before.

Since the end of the decade, United&#x27;s attendance figures have been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, however the clubs successes in the 2021–22 season led to the highest average attendance since 2020, despite the club being relegated.

The table does not include playoff attendances.
&quot;*Spectators were not allowed to attend matches due to the COVID-19 Pandemic&quot;.

== Rivalries ==
Dundee United&#x27;s traditional rivals are Dundee, with whom they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture was lacking a competitive element for a number of years until Dundee&#x27;s return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that the clubs&#x27; stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.

In spite of their rivalry, the two sides previously contemplated ground-sharing as part of the SFA&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to host Euro 2008. Perhaps the most notable meeting was the final game of the 1982–83 Premier Division season, where if United were victors at Dens Park, they would clinch the top flight title; United were victorious thanks to an Eamonn Bannon winner.

Another intense fixture is that of the New Firm derby between United and North-East rivals Aberdeen. The match itself became one of fierce competition due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the stewardship of United&#x27;s Jim McLean and Aberdeen&#x27;s Alex Ferguson.

The rivalry between Dundee United and Rangers has become a significant fixture in Scottish football in recent times, marked by competitive intensity and off-the-pitch drama. It gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s when Dundee United, under Jim McLean, challenged the dominance of Rangers and other Glasgow clubs. Key moments, such as Dundee United&#x27;s 1994 Scottish Cup final victory over Rangers, and various contentious league matches, heightened tensions.

The major spark for the rivalry between the two clubs was when Dundee United played a significant role in the relegation saga of Rangers during the 2011–12 season, marked by Rangers&#x27; financial turmoil. After Rangers entered administration and received a 10-point deduction, Dundee United delivered crucial defeats that added to Rangers&#x27; on-field struggles.

Alongside other SPL clubs, Dundee United voted against allowing Rangers to retain their place in the top tier, leading to Rangers&#x27; demotion to the Third Division. United supporters expressed their views by saying season tickets would not be renewed unless the board voted against Rangers. Chairman Stephen Thompson stated &quot;The board of directors of Dundee United are unequivocal in the belief that a form of sporting punishment must form part of the reasoning behind any decision made and, therefore, cannot vote the newco into the SPL. General sporting integrity and, more importantly, the integrity of Scottish football must also play a significant part in the decision making process. It is our belief that any form of sporting punishment must be unambiguous in the message it displays. The board of directors will act in the best interest of Dundee United and our supporters and Scottish football on this matter.&quot;

The outcome of the vote, held on July 4, 2012, was that the majority of SPL clubs voted against allowing Rangers to retain their place in the top tier. As a result, Rangers were placed in the Scottish Third Division (fourth tier) for the 2012–13 season.

== Achievements ==

=== League ===
Dundee United&#x27;s first trophy came in 1925, when they won the 1924–25 Division Two championship. After two seasons in the top tier, they were relegated, but they won the Division Two title for a second time in 1928–29. Immediate relegation followed and the club finished runners-up in 1931–32. Another runners-up spot was claimed in 1959–60, in manager Jerry Kerr&#x27;s first season, and from then club remained in the top division for the next 35-years. Under Jim McLean&#x27;s management, the club won the Premier Division title for the only time, in 1982–83, resulting in European Cup football the following season. The title win was United&#x27;s last major league success, although they finished runners-up in the First Division in 1995–96, after nearly avoiding relegation the previous season, and in third place in their first season back in the Premier Division. A third lower league title was added in 2019–20, after the curtailment of the campaign with United clear in 1st place and subsequently a fourth lower league title was added in 2023–24, as United won the Championship title.

=== Cups ===
The club had to wait several decades before their first realistic chance at cup silverware, when they began the first of a six-game losing streak of Scottish Cup Final appearances in 1974, losing 3–0 to Celtic. Towards the end of the 1970s, things began to change, with three successive appearances in the League Cup Final. United won their first major trophy with a 3–0 replay victory over Aberdeen in the 1979–80 Scottish League Cup Final. The club reached both cup finals in the following season; while they retained the League Cup by winning 3–0 against rivals Dundee, United lost out again in the Scottish Cup with a replay defeat to Rangers. United reached a third consecutive League Cup Final in 1981–82, but failed to make it a hat-trick of wins as they lost 2–1 to Rangers.
United suffered the agony of reaching three out of four Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only to lose them all by a single goal. First came a 2–1 defeat to Celtic in 1984–85, compounded by a 1–0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1–0 defeat in extra time to St Mirren in 1986–87; and finally, a last-minute 2–1 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead. A three-year gap ensued before the 1990–91 Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy, at Motherwell. The final was won 4–3 by &#x27;Well, with United again losing in extra time. The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club&#x27;s fifth final appearance in eleven years.

These defeats in cup finals at Hampden Park led to the Scottish football media claiming that United suffered from a &quot;Hampden hoodoo&quot;, as they had failed to win ten cup finals played at the ground between 1974 and 1991. When the club reached the 1994 Scottish Cup Final, manager Ivan Golac dismissed talk of the hoodoo, even though opponents Rangers were strong favourites to complete a domestic treble in the 1993–94 season. United broke the supposed hoodoo and won the Scottish Cup for the first time when Craig Brewster&#x27;s goal gave them a 1–0 win.

Eleven years passed until the next Scottish Cup final appearance, when United lost 1–0 to Celtic in 2005. Sandwiched in the middle of these appearances was a defeat on penalties to Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Challenge Cup (when United failed to concede a goal in the whole competition) and a 3–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1997 Scottish League Cup Final. United then lost the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2–2 after extra time. Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010, under the guidance of manager Peter Houston, when First Division side Ross County were defeated 3–0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup Final. David Goodwillie scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals in front of 28,000 Dundee United fans at Hampden Park.

United&#x27;s 10th appearance in the Scottish Cup final came in 2014, but the team lost 2–0 to St Johnstone at Celtic Park. The Tangerines reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost to Celtic in the final.

Two years later, after the club&#x27;s relegation from the Scottish Premiership, they faced St Mirren in the 2017 Scottish Challenge Cup Final. United won the game 2–1, marking the club&#x27;s first silverware since 2010.

=== Europe ===

The club&#x27;s first experience of Europe came in 1966–67 season when, helped by a clutch of Scandinavian players, United defeated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup holders FC Barcelona both home and away. Although Juventus proved too strong in the next round with a 3–1 aggregate victory, United made headlines and were asked to compete as Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association league in North America during the summer of 1967.

In 1981–82 they began a period in which they were competitive in European competition. In a six-year spell they reached one UEFA final, another semi-final and two quarter finals. After their only Premier Division win in 1983, the team reached the resulting semi-final of the European Cup in 1984, losing 3–2 on aggregate to Roma. In 1987, the club went one better, reaching the final of the UEFA Cup beating FC Barcelona in both the home and away fixtures en route to the final. Despite the 2–1 aggregate loss to IFK Gothenburg in the final, the club won the first-ever FIFA Fair Play Award for their supporters&#x27; sporting behaviour after the final defeat. They were also awarded the BBC Scotland Sportscene Team of the Year for that seasons exploits in Europe.

Dundee United are famous for having a 100% record against FC Barcelona in European fixtures (4 wins out of 4 matches), and remain the only British team to have achieved this feat.

The team entered the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League at the third qualifying round, culminating in a 7–1 aggregate loss to AZ Alkmaar, the 7–0 second leg defeat matching the record greatest loss inflicted on a Scottish club in European competition.

<text>Sir Henry Irving (6 February 1838 – 13 October 1905), christened John Henry Brodribb, sometimes known as J. H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the West End&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.

==Life and career==
Irving was born to a working-class family in Keinton Mandeville in the county of Somerset. W.H. Davies, the poet, was a cousin. Irving spent his childhood living with his aunt, Mrs Penberthy, at Halsetown in Cornwall. He competed in a recitation contest at a local Methodist chapel where he was beaten by William Curnow, later the editor of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He attended City Commercial School for two years before going to work in the office of a law firm at age 13. When he saw Samuel Phelps play Hamlet soon after this, he sought lessons, letters of introduction, and work in the Lyceum Theatre in Sunderland in 1856, labouring against great odds until his 1871 success in &quot;The Bells&quot; in London set him apart from all the rest.

He married Florence O&#x27;Callaghan on 15 July 1869 at St. Marylebone, London, but his personal life took second place to his professional life. On opening night of &quot;The Bells&quot;, 25 November 1871, Florence, who was pregnant with their second child, criticised his profession: &quot;Are you going on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?&quot; Irving exited their carriage at Hyde Park Corner, walked off into the night, and chose never to see her again. He maintained a discreet distance from his children as well, but became closer to them as they grew older. Florence Irving never divorced Irving, and once he had been knighted she styled herself &quot;Lady Irving&quot;; Irving never remarried.
His elder son, Harry Brodribb Irving (1870–1919), usually known as &quot;H B Irving&quot;, became a famous actor and later a theatre manager. His younger son, Laurence Irving (1871–1914), became a dramatist and later drowned, with his wife Mabel Hackney, in the sinking of the &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;. H B married Dorothea Baird and they had a son, Laurence Irving (1897–1988), who became a well-known Hollywood art director and his grandfather&#x27;s biographer, and a daughter, Elizabeth Irving (1904 – 2003) an actress and the founder of Keep Britain Tidy.

In November 1882 Irving became a Freemason, being initiated into the prestigious Jerusalem Lodge No 197 in London. In 1887 he became a founder member and first Treasurer of the Savage Club Lodge No 2190, a Lodge associated with London&#x27;s Savage Club.

He eventually took over the management of the Lyceum Theatre and brought actress Ellen Terry into partnership with him as Ophelia to his Hamlet, Lady Macbeth to his Macbeth, Portia to his Shylock, Beatrice to his Benedick, etc. Before joining the Lyceum, Terry had fled her first marriage and conceived two out-of-wedlock children with architect-designer Edward William Godwin, but regardless of how much and how often her behavior defied the strict morality expected by her Victorian audiences, she somehow remained popular. It could be said that Irving found his family in his professional company, which included his ardent supporter and manager Bram Stoker and Terry&#x27;s two illegitimate children, Teddy and Edy.

Whether Irving&#x27;s long, spectacularly successful relationship with leading lady Ellen Terry was romantic as well as professional has been the subject of much historical speculation. Most of their correspondence was lost or burned by her descendants. According to Michael Holroyd&#x27;s book about Irving and Terry, &quot;A Strange Eventful History&quot;:

Terry&#x27;s son Teddy, later known as Edward Gordon Craig, spent much of his childhood (from 1879, when he was 8, until 1897) indulged by Irving backstage at the Lyceum. Craig, who came to be regarded as something of a visionary for the theatre of the future, wrote an especially vivid, book-length tribute to Irving. (&quot;Let me state at once, in clearest unmistakable terms, that I have never known of, or seen, or heard, a greater actor than was Irving.&quot;) George Bernard Shaw, at the time a theatre critic who was jealous of Irving&#x27;s connection to Ellen Terry (whom Shaw himself wanted in his own plays), conceded Irving&#x27;s genius after Irving died.

===Early career===
After a few years&#x27; schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton&#x27;s play, &quot;Richelieu&quot;, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre.

For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts.


He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James&#x27;s Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s first successful solo play, &quot;Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack&quot; (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen&#x27;s Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. In the spring of 1869, Irving was one of the original twelve members of The Lambs of London—assembled by John Hare as a social club for actors—and would be made an Honorary Lifetime member in 1883. He finally made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery&#x27;s &quot;Two Roses&quot;, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.

In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman&#x27;s management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving&#x27;s sudden success as Mathias in &quot;The Bells,&quot; a version of Erckmann-Chatrian&#x27;s &quot;Le Juif polonais&quot; by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life.

With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills&#x27; &quot;Charles I&quot; and &quot;Eugene Aram&quot;, in &quot;Richelieu&quot;, and in 1874 in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in &quot;Macbeth&quot;; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mary&quot;; in 1877 in &quot;Richard III&quot;; and in &quot;The Lyons Mail&quot;. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.

===Peak years===

In 1878, Irving entered into a partnership with actress Ellen Terry and re-opened the Lyceum under his own management. With Terry as Ophelia and Portia, he revived &quot;Hamlet&quot; and produced &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1879). His Shylock was as much discussed as his Hamlet had been, the dignity with which he invested the vengeful Jewish merchant marking a departure from the traditional interpretation of the role.
After the production of Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Cup&quot; and revivals of &quot;Othello&quot; (in which Irving played Iago to Edwin Booth&#x27;s title character) and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, there began a period at the Lyceum which had a potent effect on the English stage.

&quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; (1882) was followed by &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1884); an adaptation of Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Vicar of Wakefield&quot; by W. G. Wills (1885); &quot;Faust&quot; (1885); &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1888, with incidental music by Arthur Sullivan); &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;, by Watts Phillips (1889); &quot;Ravenswood&quot; by Herman, and Merivales&#x27; dramatic version of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1890). Portrayals in 1892 of the characters of Wolsey in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and of the title character in &quot;King Lear&quot; were followed in 1893 by a performance of Becket in Tennyson&#x27;s play of the same name. During these years, too, Irving, with the whole Lyceum company, paid several successful visits to the United States and Canada, which were repeated in succeeding years. As Terry aged, there seemed to be fewer opportunities for her in his company; that was one reason she eventually left, moving on into less steady but nonetheless beloved stage work, including solo performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s women.

===Safety theatres===

In 1887, the Exeter Theatre Royal fire claimed the lives of 186 people, injuring dozens more, during a performance of &quot;The Romany Rye&quot; being staged by fellow actor-manager Wilson Barrett at the Theatre Royal, Exeter.

Irving was one of the first high-profile people to donate to the relief fund for survivors and orphans, sending £100.

The fire caused Irving to become involved in ensuring better safety for theatres, and he developed the &quot;Irving Safety Theatre&quot; principles, working with eminent architect Alfred Darbyshire. These principles included making the theatre site isolated, dividing the auditorium from the back of house, a minimum height above street level for any part of the audience, providing two separate exits for every section of the audience, improved stage construction including a smoke flue, and fire-resistant construction throughout.

The first theatre built to these principles was the rebuilt New Theatre Royal in Exeter.

===Influence on Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;===

From 1878, Bram Stoker worked for Irving as a business manager at the Lyceum. Stoker idolised Irving to the point that &quot;As one contemporary remarked, &#x27;To Bram, Irving is as a god, and can do no wrong.&#x27; In the considered judgment of one biographer, Stoker&#x27;s friendship with Irving was &#x27;the most important love relationship of his adult life.&#x27;&quot; Irving, however, &quot;… was a self-absorbed and profoundly manipulative man. He enjoyed cultivating rivalries between his followers, and to remain in his circle required constant, careful courting of his notoriously fickle affections.&quot; When Stoker began writing &quot;Dracula&quot;, Irving was the chief inspiration for the title character. In his 2002 paper for &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill Meets Dracula: William F. Cody, Bram Stoker, and the Frontiers of Racial Decay&quot;, historian Louis S. Warren writes:

===Later years===

The chief remaining novelties at the Lyceum during Irving&#x27;s term as sole manager (at the beginning of 1899 the theatre passed into the hands of a limited-liability company) were Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1894); J. Comyns Carr&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot; in 1895; &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, in which Irving played Iachimo, in 1896; Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Madame Sans-Gene&quot; in 1897; and &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, a play by Laurence Irving, the actor&#x27;s second son, in 1898.

Irving received a death threat in 1899 from fellow actor (and murderer of William Terriss) Richard Archer Prince. Terriss had been stabbed at the stage door of the Adelphi Theatre in December 1897 and in the wake of his death, Prince was committed to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Irving was critical of the unusually lenient sentence, remarking &quot;Terriss was an actor, so his murderer will not be executed.&quot; Two years later, Prince had found Irving&#x27;s home address and threatened to murder him &quot;when he gets out&quot;. Irving was advised to submit the letter to the Home Office to ensure Prince&#x27;s continued incarceration, which Irving declined to do.
In 1898 Irving was Rede Lecturer at the University of Cambridge. The new regime at the Lyceum was signalled by the production of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Robespierre&quot; in 1899, in which Irving reappeared after a serious illness, and in 1901 by an elaborate revival of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. Irving&#x27;s only subsequent production in London was as Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Dante&quot; (1903) at the Drury Lane.

==Death==
On 13 October 1905, at 67 years old, Irving had completed a performance and suffered a stroke after returning to his lodging at the lobby of the Midland Hotel, Bradford, where he died before medical attention could arrive. A more dramatic, but untrue story, would later be written by Thomas Anstey Guthrie in his &#x27;Long Retrospect&#x27;: &quot;Within three months, on 13 October 1905, Henry Irving, when appearing as Becket at the Bradford Theatre, was seized with syncope just after uttering Becket&#x27;s dying words &#x27;Into thy hands, O Lord, into thy hands&#x27;, and though he lived for an hour or so longer he never spoke again.&quot; (Thomas Anstey Guthrie. &quot;Long Retrospect&quot;)

Another witness at the play, Bram Stoker (known for being the author of &quot;Dracula&quot;), told reporters later that &quot;We chatted for awhile after the play, and I left him, although not notably strong, not in any way cast down and not more exhausted than had been usual for some time. A little more than three-quarters of an hour afterward I was sent for by the man who attended Sir Henry from the theatre, who told me that he had fainted or collapsed on entering the Midland Hotel. Hurrying down, I found Sir Henry lying in the passage— dead.&quot; Stoker added, &quot;Had he died on the stage, as might have happened, it would have given shock and bitter memory to many tender hearts.&quot; Guthrie&#x27;s confusion may have come from the fact that the character Becket&#x27;s last words in the play are &quot;O Lord, into thy hands,&quot; but, as a correspondent noted, &quot;Then the curtain falls, and within a very short time, having just reached his hotel, the great actor breathed his last.&quot;

The chair that he was sitting in before he died is now at the Garrick Club. He was cremated and his ashes buried in Westminster Abbey, thereby becoming the first person to be cremated prior to interment at Westminster.

There is a statue of him near the National Portrait Gallery in London. That statue, as well as the influence of Irving himself, plays an important part in the Robertson Davies novel &quot;World of Wonders&quot;. The Irving Memorial Garden was opened on 19 July 1951 by Laurence Olivier.

==Legacy==
Both on and off the stage, Irving always maintained a high ideal of his profession, and in 1895 he received a knighthood (first offered in 1883), the first ever accorded an actor. He was also the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Dublin (LL.D 1892), Cambridge (Litt.D 1898), and Glasgow (LL.D 1899). He also received the Komthur Cross, 2nd class, of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Saxe-Meiningen.
His acting divided critics; opinions differed as to the extent to which his mannerisms of voice and deportment interfered with or assisted the expression of his ideas. Irving&#x27;s idiosyncratic style of acting and its effect on amateur players was mildly satirised in &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot;. Mr Pooter&#x27;s son brings Mr Burwin-Fosselton of the Holloway Comedians to supper, a young man who entirely monopolised the conversation, and:

&quot;...who not only looked rather like Mr Irving but seemed to imagine he &quot;was&quot; the celebrated actor... he began doing the Irving business all through supper. He sank so low down in his chair that his chin was almost on a level with the table, and twice he kicked Carrie under the table, upset his wine, and flashed a knife uncomfortably near Gowing&#x27;s face.&quot;

In T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem, &quot;&quot; (), the title character&#x27;s old age and theatrical distinction are expressed in the couplet:

For he once was a Star of the highest degree--&lt;br&gt;
He has acted with Irving, he&#x27;s acted with Tree.

These verses appear in the lyrics of the homonymous song in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1981 musical &quot;Cats&quot;.
In the 1963 West End musical comedy &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; the actor Chitterlow does an impression of Irving in &quot;The Bells&quot;. Percy French&#x27;s burlesque heroic poem &quot;Abdul Abulbul Amir&quot; lists among the mock-heroic attributes of Abdul&#x27;s adversary, the Russian Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar, that &quot;he could imitate Irving&quot;. In the 1995 film &quot;A Midwinter&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Kenneth Branagh, two actors discuss Irving, and one of them, Richard Briers does an imitation of his speech. In the play &quot;The Woman in Black&quot;, set in the Victorian era, the actor playing Kipps tells Kipps &#x27;We&#x27;ll make an Irving of you yet,&#x27; in Act 1, as Kipps is not a very good actor due to his inexperience. In the political sitcom &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (sequel to &quot;Yes Minister&quot;), in the episode &quot;The Patron of the Arts&quot;, first aired on 14 January 1988, the Prime Minister is asked what was the last play he&#x27;d seen, and replies &quot;Hamlet.&quot; When asked &quot;Whose?&quot; – specifically, who played Hamlet, not who wrote it – he is unable to remember and is prompted with the suggestion &quot;Henry Irving?&quot; to audience laughter. A play by David Hare, to premiere in 2025 and starring Ralph Fiennes as Irving, &quot;Grace Pervades&quot;, explores the life of Irving, Terry and Terry&#x27;s children, Edith Craig and Edward Gordon Craig.

<text>Laurence Sydney Brodribb Irving (21 December 1871 – 29 May 1914) was an English dramatist and actor. He died along with his wife, Mabel, in the &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; disaster in 1914.

==Life and career==
Born in London, Laurence Irving was a son of the great Victorian actor-manager, Sir Henry Irving and his wife Florence (née O&#x27;Callaghan), and brother to actor manager Harry Brodribb Irving. He was educated at Marlborough College and the College Rollin in Paris, following which he was in Russia for three years studying for the Foreign Office. However, instead he took up acting, making his first appearance in 1891 as Snug in &quot;The Dream&quot; in F. R. Benson&#x27;s theatrical company – not counting childhood performances. In 1892 he appeared at Toole&#x27;s Theatre in &quot;Daisy&#x27;s Escape&quot;, and after a time toured as Svengali in &quot;Trilby&quot;. In 1898 he then joined his father&#x27;s Company at the Lyceum Theatre taking minor roles or juvenile leads as in &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1898), &quot;Robespierre&quot; (1899), as Courriol in &quot;The Lyons Mail&quot; (1900), &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1900–01), &quot;Dante&quot; (1902–03), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1904–05), and as Nemours in &quot;Louis Xl&quot;. &quot;Robespierre&quot; was his own translation from the French of Victorien Sardou, as also was &quot;Dante&quot;, in which his father acted.

Soon after he became an actor-manager starring with his own Company, playing the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He adapted Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; into &quot;The Unwritten Law&quot; and just before sailing for the United States and Canada in 1912 he made a success in London with his own adaptation from the Hungarian of a Japanese subject entitled &quot;The Typhoon&quot;. A topical play set in the time of the Russo-Japanese War, with Irving playing a Japanese officer, it was first produced by him at the Haymarket Theatre in April 1912 before taking it on a tour of the provinces. His talents as an actor were recognised in his portrayal of the crafty old Nikolas Arnesson, Bishop of Oslo in Ibsen&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Pretenders&quot; at the Haymarket. He was Iago in a production of &quot;Othello&quot; at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre.

Irving was also a dramatist, his stage plays including &quot;Robespierre&quot; (1899), &quot;Richard Lovelace&quot; (1901), &quot;Dante&quot; (1903), &quot;The Fool Hath Said: There Is No God&quot; (1908), &quot;The Incubus&quot; (1909), &quot;The Affinity&quot; (1910), and &quot;The Three Daughters of Monsieur Dupont&quot; (1910). Due to the financial failure of his play &quot;Dante&quot; his father was forced to sell the Lyceum Theatre, London. Irving was married to a fellow performer, actress Mabel Lucy Hackney (1872–1914).

Laurence and Mabel were on a tour of first Australia and then North America from 1912 to 1914. Their biggest success on the tour was Laurence&#x27;s own play &quot;The Typhoon&quot;.

==Death==
At the end of the tour they were returning home when Laurence and Mabel Irving drowned in the RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; disaster on May 29th 1914 when in the early hours of the morning, The &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was rammed by the , a Norwegian collier, in her starboard midsection. &quot;Storstad&quot; remained afloat, however &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was severely damaged. A gaping hole in her side caused the lower decks to flood faster than the crew could handle, made worse by the Empress&#x27; ever increasing starboard list. Most of the passengers and crew located in the lower decks drowned quickly and water entered through open portholes, some only a few feet above the water line, and inundated passageways and cabins. Those berthed in the upper decks were awakened by the collision, and immediately boarded lifeboats on the boat deck. Within a few minutes of the collision, the list was so severe that the port lifeboats could not be launched. At least one boat was lowered on the port side, which boat is not clear, however what is known is that said boat flipped during lowering spilling its occupants into the frigid water. Five starboard lifeboats were launched successfully, while a sixth capsized during lowering on the starboard side.

Ten or eleven minutes after the collision, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; lurched violently onto her starboard side, allowing as many as 700 passengers and crew to crawl out of the portholes and decks onto her port side. The ship lay on her side for a minute or two, having seemingly run aground. A few minutes later at 02:10, about 14 minutes after the collision, the bow rose briefly out of the water and the ship finally sank. Hundreds of people were thrown into the near-freezing water. The disaster resulted in the deaths of 1,012 people.
Accounts of the tragedy say that Laurence and Mabel Irving were separated and whilst Laurence may have been in a position of temporary safety, he knew Mabel could not swim and so jumped back into the St. Lawrence River to rescue her. Their bodies were never recovered.

<doc id="331078" wikidata="Q1239291" url="?curid=331078" title="Alexander Downer">
<text>Alexander John Gosse Downer (born 9 September 1951) is an Australian former politician and diplomat who was leader of the Liberal Party from 1994 to 1995, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1996 to 2007, and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018.

Downer was born in Adelaide, the son of Sir Alick Downer and the grandson of Sir John Downer. After periods working for the Bank of New South Wales and with the diplomatic service, he was appointed executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in 1983. He also served as an advisor to Liberal leaders Malcolm Fraser and Andrew Peacock. Downer was elected to parliament at the 1984 federal election, winning the Division of Mayo in South Australia. He was added to the opposition frontbench in 1987.

After the Coalition lost the 1993 election, John Hewson&#x27;s position as leader of the Liberal Party came into question. Downer successfully challenged him for the leadership in May 1994, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. He initially had high approval ratings, but after a series of gaffes resigned the leadership in January 1995 and was replaced by John Howard. He was the first Liberal leader to fail to lead the party to an election, and remains the shortest-serving leader in party history.

When the Howard government came to power in 1996, Downer was made Minister for Foreign Affairs. He served until the government&#x27;s defeat in 2007, making him the longest-serving foreign minister in Australian history. Downer left politics in 2008, and was subsequently named Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Cyprus. He held that post until 2014, when he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom by the Abbott government.

==Early life and education==
The Downer family has a long history in South Australian politics. Their earliest ancestors were Mary Ann Downer (1792–1868) and her son Henry Downer (1811–1870), his great-grandfather, who travelled from England in 1862 aboard the &quot;Eden&quot;, settling in Adelaide. Downer&#x27;s father was Minister for Immigration in the Menzies government and later served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. His paternal grandfather, Sir John Downer, served twice as Premier of South Australia in the late 19th century, and was later one of the inaugural members of the Australian Senate. Downer&#x27;s maternal grandfather was the businessman and philanthropist James Hay Gosse, whose father was the explorer William Gosse.

Alexander Downer was born on 9 September 1951 in Adelaide, South Australia, when the family were living in the Adelaide Hills home built by his father, Arbury Park. He is the third of four children born to Sir Alexander &quot;Alick&quot; Downer and Mary Downer (née Gosse); he has three sisters.

Downer was educated at Geelong Grammar School in Australia, then in England (while his father was High Commissioner) at Radley College between 1964 and 1970. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Arts in politics and economics at Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne.

==Early career==
From 1975 to 1976, he worked as an economist for the Bank of New South Wales, before entering the Australian Diplomatic Service, where he served until 1982. Some of Downer&#x27;s time in the Diplomatic Service was spent at a posting in Brussels, where he undertook a French language training course. He then worked as an adviser to the then Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser and subsequent Leader of the Federal Opposition Andrew Peacock.

Prior to the 1981 by-election Downer unsuccessfully sought Liberal Party preselection for the seat of Boothby, and in 1982 for the state seat of Bragg. From 1983 to 1984, he also served as the Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. In 1984, he was finally preselected and was elected to the federal Parliament as Liberal member for Mayo, in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia. He held this seat until his resignation from Parliament in 2008.

==Opposition leader==

Downer held a number of positions on the opposition front bench from 1987 onwards. When the Liberals unexpectedly lost the 1993 election to Prime Minister Paul Keating, after the election Downer became Shadow Treasurer replacing Peter Reith who had resigned from the portfolio. During this time, Downer began to be talked of as a possible leader as John Hewson was seen as weak following the 1993 election defeat. In May 1994 Downer succeeded Hewson as Liberal party leader after defeating him in a leadership spill which Hewson initiated. Downer was the first South Australian to lead the party, as well as the first South Australian to lead the non-Labor side since Federation.

As Liberal leader, Downer initially attracted record levels of public support, even when incumbent Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a series of attacks on Downer&#x27;s privileged background. Then aged 43, he was perceived as a fresh-faced alternative to a government in its twelfth year of power.

Several months after becoming leader Downer&#x27;s support base was quickly eroded, however, by a series of embarrassing public blunders. One was the emergence of a 1987 speech to the far-right Australian League of Rights. Another was the sacking of John Hewson from the shadow ministry in August 1994. A damaging incident emerged from a formal dinner attended by Downer. While promoting the Liberal slogan &quot;The Things That Matter&quot;, in a reference to abusing husbands, Downer quipped that the party&#x27;s domestic violence policy would accordingly be named &quot;The Things That Batter&quot;. Downer also found it difficult to handle the gulf between monarchists and republicans in his own party but resolved the dispute by promising to establish a constitutional convention to consider the issue. By the end of 1994, his approval ratings had dwindled to 34 percent after being as high as 53 percent.

Another event in 1994 that would spell the end of Downer&#x27;s leadership was his decision for the Coalition to support the Keating government&#x27;s sexual privacy legislation. The issue divided the Coalition with several MPs and Senators either voting against the legislation or abstaining from it.

On 9 January 1995, internal Liberal Party polling showed that with Downer as leader, the Coalition had a slim chance of holding its marginal seats in the next election, let alone of winning government. On 11 January, Downer launched a major policy statement with ten policy commitments and criticised Liberals he saw as undermining his leadership. Downer negotiated in mid-January with now back-bencher Hewson, but this resulted in Hewson publicly declaring he wanted the shadow Treasury portfolio which meant Downer would have to sack deputy Liberal leader Peter Costello from the position to give the job to Hewson. On 30 January 1995, he resigned as Liberal Leader and John Howard was elected unopposed to replace him. Downer pledged his support to Howard and said he would &quot;kneecap&quot; anyone who undermined Howard&#x27;s second attempt at winning the prime ministership.

With a tenure of just over eight months, Downer is to date the shortest-serving leader of the federal Liberal Party. He is also, alongside Brendan Nelson, one of two federal Liberal leaders never to lead the party into an election. On opposition leadership, he said in 2008, &quot;The moment when I wanted to [leave] was just about the first day I started in the job. There was many a time from the first day onwards when I thought to myself, &quot;How the hell can I get out of this?&quot;

==Minister for Foreign Affairs==

Given choice of cabinet position in the incoming Howard government elected in March 1996, Downer became Minister for Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 3 December 2007. He became the longest-serving Foreign Minister of Australia on 20 December 2004.

One of Downer&#x27;s earliest initiatives as Foreign Minister was to work with New Zealand to broker a peace agreement in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, which ended a long running civil conflict.

In 1996, Downer took the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to the United Nations General Assembly where it was embraced by most members of the world body. Pakistan, India and North Korea were among those who failed to ratify the treaty and went ahead in developing nuclear weapons capability. In 1999, the U.S. Senate rejected ratification of the treaty. Downer stated

However, subsequent policies of the Howard government, including export of uranium to India, and general support for the unilateralist approach of the Bush Administration were seen as undermining the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

In 1999, Downer assisted the United Nations to hold a referendum in East Timor and in negotiating the entry of the INTERFET peace keeping force into East Timor.

In 2003, ASIS installed listening devices in the Palace of Government in Dili, East Timor, and later Downer signed a controversial agreement with the government of East Timor for mining of gas and oil reserves in the Timor Gap. The agreement was criticised as unfair to East Timor and attracted a bipartisan letter of reproach from 50 members of the United States Congress. The reserves were closer to East Timor than Australia but claimed by Australia on the basis of a treaty made with General Suharto in 1989.

As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Downer played a role in the diplomatic dispute known as the Tampa affair in 2001 in which Australia denied permission for the to dock at Christmas Island, having picked up a number of asylum seekers trying to get to Australia by boat. Downer also played a role in the subsequent negotiation of the &quot;Pacific Solution&quot; in which Australia held asylum seekers off-shore in foreign jurisdictions.

In 2003, Downer was accused of not passing on intelligence reports he received before the 2002 Bali bombings. He countered that the warnings were not specific enough to warrant their further release to the Australian public.

Downer supported Australia&#x27;s participation in the Iraq War. He argued that Iraq, the Middle East and the world would be better off without the regime of Saddam Hussein and he defended the claim that weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq.

In August 2004, he made the claim based on official assessment reports that North Korea&#x27;s Taepo Dong ballistic missile had a range sufficient to reach Sydney, a view disputed by some.

In 2005, Australian members of the spiritual group Falun Gong launched action against Downer in the ACT Supreme Court alleging that his department had unfairly limited their freedom of expression.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under Downer was accused by Chinese diplomat and defector Chen Yonglin of closely collaborating with the Chinese Embassy in Canberra, even to the extent of &quot;giving suggestions to the Chinese Government on how to handle difficult political cases&quot;. Downer was accused of pursuing an unduly strong pro-China policy and failing to address human rights violations adequately.

In March 2006, Downer said the Australian Government opposed selling uranium to India. Downer was quoted as saying &quot;Australia had no plans to change a policy which rules out uranium sales to countries like India which have not signed the UN&#x27;s nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).&quot; Following the conclusion of the US-India nuclear agreement, the Australian Government said it would export uranium to civil nuclear facilities in India subject to several conditions, one of which was the conclusion of a bilateral safeguards agreement.

In April 2006, he appeared before the Cole Inquiry regarding the oil for food scandal and testified that he was ignorant of the huge kickbacks paid to the Iraq government, despite claims by the opposition Labor Party that many warnings had been received by his department from various sources. The Cole inquiry made it clear Downer had been unaware of the kickbacks.

In July 2006, it was claimed that six months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Downer had argued that participating in the invasion would be commercially beneficial for Australia. Downer expressed concern that the war might lead to America taking all of Australia&#x27;s wheat market.

In August 2006, it was claimed by a former weapons inspector, Dr John Gee, that Downer had in 2004 suppressed accurate and provable information that the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was fundamentally flawed.

As Foreign Minister, Downer initially supported the United States Government&#x27;s incarceration of two Australian citizens, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Downer later told the US he wanted both released if they were not to be charged. On that basis, Habib was released and Hicks charged.

A major challenge for Downer was handling relations with Australia&#x27;s most important neighbour, Indonesia. Downer negotiated the 2006 Lombok Treaty to put security relations between the two countries on a stable footing, built bilateral co-operation to fight terrorism, people smuggling and illegal fishing. One of the recent difficulties which erupted between Australia and Indonesia was when Australia accepted a boatload of asylum seekers from Indonesia&#x27;s Papua province in March 2006.

In September 2007, on the sidelines of the 2007 APEC Conference in Sydney, Downer indicated that Australia planned to launch bilateral ministerial-level security talks with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Downer also stated, &quot;China is a good partner of Australia. Whatever the differences there are between us in terms of our political systems, human rights issues, China is a very important part of the strategic architecture, the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region and it&#x27;s important we have good forums to discuss any issues of that kind with them.&quot;

==Post-parliamentary career==
Following the Howard government&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election, Downer declined to make a comeback to the leadership and to serve on the Opposition frontbench, amid widespread speculation that he would resign his seat and leave federal politics, having spent over a decade in government. He subsequently resigned from Parliament on 14 July 2008 and took a consulting job with Woodside Energy. His resignation triggered a by-election in the seat of Mayo.

On 3 July 2008, the University of Adelaide announced Downer&#x27;s appointment as Visiting Professor of Politics and International Trade in the School of History and Politics, including contributions to teaching and research, and work with the University&#x27;s Institute for International Trade. He was also the vice chairman at Carnegie Mellon University, South Australia.

At about the same time, he went into partnership with Ian Smith (a former Liberal Party advisor and husband of former Australian Democrats leader and Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja) and Nick Bolkus (a former Labor Senator for South Australia) in a boutique consultancy firm, Bespoke Approach.

Also in 2008, Downer discussed the possibility of working as a United Nations envoy to Cyprus with the UN Secretary-General to help revive the peace process. The appointment received the support of the Rudd government, via the Foreign Minister Stephen Smith, and it took effect on 14 July 2008.

He resigned in February 2014 to take up the post of Australia&#x27;s High Commissioner in London where he replaced former South Australian Labor premier, Mike Rann. On 10 May 2016, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Downer and Erika Thompson met with George Papadopoulos in London and information from this meeting caused the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia&#x27;s attempts to disrupt the 2016 US Presidential election, and whether there was any involvement by Donald Trump&#x27;s associates. Downer told &quot;The Australian&quot; in a 28 April 2018 interview that &quot;nothing [Papadopoulos] said in their meeting indicated Trump himself had been conspiring with the Russians to collect information on Hillary Clinton&quot;. Downer remained as High Commissioner until 27 April 2018 when he was succeeded by George Brandis.

He has had a number of board appointments, including the Advisory Board of British strategic intelligence and advisory firm Hakluyt &amp; Company, merchant bankers Cappello Capital Corp., the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Huawei in Australia, and the board of Lakes Oil. Downer has said that Huawei should not be considered a potential national security risk. Downer&#x27;s comments are at odds with an October 2012 US congressional panel&#x27;s findings that have deemed Huawei a security threat to the US and other nations.

A longtime supporter of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, Downer has played a leading role opposing moves to replace the Monarch with a president.

In 2015, he was recommended by British and Australian officials as a possible compromise candidate for Commonwealth Secretary-General but Baroness Patricia Scotland was ultimately elected to the post at the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In 2017, it was announced that Downer would join UK think tank Policy Exchange as Chair of Trustees. In June 2018, Downer became the Executive Chairman of the International School of Government at King&#x27;s College, London. He is a non-executive director of CQS and of Yellow Cake plc.

In 2018, he was named to Tilray&#x27;s International Advisory Board. Downer is Executive Chair of the International School for Government at King&#x27;s College London.

In 2019 and 2020, Downer wrote regular columns for the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;. In his column on 1 November 2020 discussing the forthcoming US election (held on 3 November), he declared that if he was eligible to vote in the US (which, he explained, he was not), although &quot;there&#x27;s no perfect choice&quot;, he would vote for Donald Trump.

In 2021, Downer joined ASX-listed mining company Ironbark Zinc as non-executive director.

==Honours==
In January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal.

Downer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2013 Australia Day Honours. In the same year, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of South Australia.

==Personal life==
Downer is married to Nicky (née Nicola Rosemary Robinson), who is a prominent figure in the arts community and was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2005 for her service to the arts. They have four children, including Georgina Downer.

He is an enthusiast of V8 car racing and holds a CAMS racing licence.

In mid-2014, the Downers sold &quot;Brampton House&quot; in Mount George, though they intended to return to South Australia in 2017.

==In popular culture==
Alexander Downer was portrayed by Richard Binsley in the 2020 miniseries &quot;The Comey Rule&quot; and Francis Greenslade in the 2014 film &quot;Schapelle. He was also referenced in Kath and Kim.

He was featured in the musical &quot;Keating!&quot;, played by Cam Rogers (2006 Sydney run) and Casey Bennetto (2005 Melbourne run).

<text>Matryoshka dolls ( ; ), also known as stacking dolls, nesting dolls, Russian tea dolls, or Russian dolls, are a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another. The name &quot;Matryoshka&quot; is a diminutive form of &quot;Matryosha&quot; (), in turn a hypocoristic of the Russian female first name &quot;Matryona&quot; ().

A set of matryoshkas consists of a wooden figure, which separates at the middle, top from bottom, to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside of it, and so on.

The first Russian nested doll set was made in 1890 by wood turning craftsman and wood carver Vasily Zvyozdochkin from a design by Sergey Malyutin, who was a folk crafts painter at Abramtsevo. Traditionally the outer layer is a woman, dressed in a sarafan, a long and shapeless traditional Russian peasant jumper dress. The figures inside may be of any gender; the smallest, innermost doll is typically a baby turned from a single piece of wood. Much of the artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be very elaborate. The dolls often follow a theme; the themes may vary, from fairy tale characters to Soviet leaders. In some countries, matryoshka dolls are often referred to as babushka dolls, though they are not known by this name in Russian; &quot;babushka&quot; () means .

== History ==
The first Russian nested doll set was carved in 1890 at the Children&#x27;s Education Workshop by Vasily Zvyozdochkin and designed by Sergey Malyutin, who was a folk crafts painter in the Abramtsevo estate of Savva Mamontov, a Russian industrialist and patron of arts. Mamontov&#x27;s brother, Anatoly Ivanovich Mamontov (1839–1905), created the Children&#x27;s Education Workshop to make and sell children&#x27;s toys. The doll set was painted by Malyutin. Malyutin&#x27;s doll set consisted of eight dolls—the outermost was a mother in a traditional dress holding a red-combed rooster. The inner dolls were her children, girls and a boy, and the innermost a baby. The Children&#x27;s Education Workshop was closed in the late 1890s, but the tradition of the matryoshka simply relocated to Sergiyev Posad, the Russian city known as a toy-making center since the fourteenth century.

The inspiration for matryoshka dolls is not clear. Matryoshka dolls may have been inspired by a nesting doll imported from Japan. The Children&#x27;s Education workshop where Zvyozdochkin was a lathe operator received a five piece, cylinder-shaped nesting doll featuring Fukuruma (Fukurokuju) in the late 1890s, which is now part of the collection at the Sergiev Posad Museum of Toys. Other east Asian dolls share similarities with matryoshka dolls such as the Kokeshi dolls, originating in Northern Honshū, the main island of Japan, although they cannot be placed one inside another, and the round hollow daruma doll depicting a Buddhist monk. Another possible source of inspiration is the nesting Easter eggs produced on a lathe by Russian woodworkers during the late 19th Century.

Savva Mamontov&#x27;s wife presented a set of matryoshka dolls at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900, and the toy earned a bronze medal. Soon after, matryoshka dolls were being made in several places in Russia and shipped around the world.

==Manufacture==
=== Centers of production ===
The first matryoshka dolls were produced in the Children&#x27;s Education (Detskoye vospitanie) workshop in Moscow. After it closed in 1904, production was transferred to the city of Sergiev Posad (Сергиев Посад), known as Sergiev (Сергиев) from 1919 to 1930 and Zagorsk from 1930 to 1991.

Matryoshka factories were later established in other cities and villages:

* the village of Polkhovsky Maidan (Полховский-Майдан), which is the primary producer of matryoshka blanks, and its neighboring villages Krutets (Крутец) and Gorodets (Городец)
* the city of Semenov, (Семёнов)
* the city of Kirov (Киров), known as Vyatka (Вя́тка) (from 1780 to 1934 and renamed Kirov in 1934 although many of its institutions reverted to the name Vyatka (Viatka) in 1991
* the city of Nolinsk (Нолинск)
* the city of Yoshkar-Ola (Йошкар-Ола) in the Republic of Mari-El

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the closure of many matryoshka factories, and the loosening of restrictions, independent artists began to produce matryoshka dolls in homes and art studios.

=== Method ===
Ordinarily, matryoshka dolls are crafted from linden wood. There is a popular misconception that they are carved from one piece of wood. Rather, they are produced using: a lathe equipped with a balance bar; four heavy long distinct types of chisels (hook, knife, pipe, and spoon); and a &quot;set of handmade wooden calipers particular to a size of the doll&quot;. The tools are hand forged by a village blacksmith from car axles or other salvage. A wood carver uniquely crafts each set of wooden calipers. Multiple pieces of wood are meticulously carved into the nesting set.

=== Shape, Size, and Pieces per Set ===
The standard shape approximates a human silhouette with a flared base on the largest doll for stability. Other shapes include potbelly, cone, bell, egg, bottle, sphere, and cylinder.

The size and number of pieces varies widely. The industry standard from the Soviet period, which accounts for approximately 50% of all matryoshka produced, is six inches tall and consists of 5 dolls except for matryoshka dolls manufactured in Semenov whose standard is five inches tall and consists of 6 pieces. Other common sets are the 3 piece, the 7 piece, and the 10 piece.

=== Common characteristics ===
Matryoshka dolls painted in the traditional style share common elements. They depict female figures wearing a peasant dress (sarafan) and scarf or shawl usually with an apron and flowers.  Each successively smaller doll is identical or nearly so. Distinctive regional styles developed in different areas of matryoshka manufacture.

== Themes in dolls ==
 Matryoshka dolls are often designed to follow a particular theme; for instance, peasant girls in traditional dress. Originally, themes were often drawn from tradition or fairy tale characters, in keeping with the craft tradition—but since the late 20th century, they have embraced a larger range, including Russian leaders and popular culture.

Common themes of matryoshkas are floral and relate to nature. Often Christmas, Easter, and religion are used as themes for the doll. Modern artists create many new styles of nesting dolls, mostly as an alternative purchase option for tourism. These include animal collections, portraits, and caricatures of famous politicians, musicians, athletes, astronauts, &quot;robots&quot;, and popular movie stars. Today, some Russian artists specialize in painting themed matryoshka dolls that feature specific categories of subjects, people, or nature. Areas with notable matryoshka styles include Sergiyev Posad, Semionovo (now the town of Semyonov), , and the city of Kirov.

===Political matryoshkas===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s during Perestroika, freedom of expression allowed the leaders of the Soviet Union to become a common theme of the matryoshka, with the largest doll featuring then-current leader Mikhail Gorbachev. These became very popular at the time, affectionately earning the nickname of a &quot;Gorba&quot; or &quot;Gorby&quot;, the namesake of Gorbachev. With the periodic succession of Russian leadership after the collapse of the Soviet Union, newer versions would start to feature Russian presidents Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev.
== World record ==
The largest set of matryoshka dolls in the world is a 51-piece set hand-painted by Youlia Bereznitskaia of Russia, completed in 2003. The tallest doll in the set measures ; the smallest, . Arranged side-by-side, the dolls span .

== As metaphor ==
=== Nesting and onion metaphors ===
Matryoshkas are also used metaphorically, as a design paradigm, known as the &quot;matryoshka principle&quot; or &quot;nested doll principle&quot;. It denotes a recognizable relationship of &quot;object-within-similar-object&quot; that appears in the design of many other natural and crafted objects. Examples of this use include the matrioshka brain, the Matroska media-container format, and the Russian Doll model of multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

The onion metaphor is similar. If the outer layer is peeled off an onion, a similar onion exists within. This structure is employed by designers in applications such as the layering of clothes or the design of tables, where a smaller table nests within a larger table, and a smaller one within that.

The metaphor of the matryoshka doll (or its onion equivalent) is also used in the description of shell companies and similar corporate structures that are used in the context of tax-evasion schemes in low-tax jurisdictions (for example, offshore tax havens). It has also been used to describe satellites and suspected weapons in space.

=== Other metaphors ===
Matryoshka is often seen as a symbol of the feminine side of Russian culture. Matryoshka is associated in Russia with family and fertility. Matryoshka is used as the symbol for the epithet Mother Russia.
Matryoshka dolls are a traditional representation of the mother carrying a child within her and can be seen as a representation of a chain of mothers carrying on the family legacy through the child in their wombs. Furthermore, matryoshka dolls are used to illustrate the unity of body, soul, mind, heart, and spirit.

== As an emoji ==

In 2020, the Unicode Consortium approved the matryoshka doll (🪆) as one of the new emoji characters in release v.13. The matryoshka or nesting doll emoji was submitted to the consortium by Jef Gray and Samantha Sunne, as a non-religious, apolitical symbol of Russian-East European-Far East Asian culture.

<text>In anatomy, the axis (from Latin &quot;axis&quot;, &quot;axle&quot;) is the second cervical vertebra (C2) of the spine, immediately inferior to the atlas, upon which the head rests. The spinal cord passes through the axis.

The defining feature of the axis is its strong bony protrusion known as the dens, which rises from the superior aspect of the bone.

==Structure==
The body is deeper in front or in the back and is prolonged downward anteriorly to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra.

It presents a median longitudinal ridge in front, separating two lateral depressions for the attachment of the longus colli muscles.
===Dens===
The dens, also called the odontoid process, or the peg, is the most pronounced projecting feature of the axis. The dens exhibits a slight constriction where it joins the main body of the vertebra. The condition where the dens is separated from the body of the axis is called &quot;os odontoideum&quot; and may cause nerve and circulation compression syndrome. On its anterior surface is an oval or nearly circular facet for articulation with that on the anterior arch of the atlas. On the back of the neck, and frequently extending on to its lateral surfaces, is a shallow groove for the transverse atlantal ligament which retains the process in position. The apex is pointed and gives attachment to the apical odontoid ligament. Below the apex, the process is somewhat enlarged and presents on either side a rough impression for the attachment of the alar ligament; these ligaments connect the process to the occipital bone.

The internal structure of the odontoid process is more compact than that of the body. The odontoid peg is the ascension of the atlas fused to the ascension of the axis. The peg has an articular facet at its front and forms part of a joint with the anterior arch of the atlas. It is a non-weight bearing joint. The alar ligaments, together with the apical ligaments, are attached from the sloping upper edge of the odontoid peg to the margins of the foramen magnum. The inner ligaments limit rotation of the head and are very strong. The weak apical ligament lies in front of the upper longitudinal bone of the cruciform ligament and joins the apex of the deltoid peg to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. It is the fibrous remnant of the notochord.

===Other features===
The pedicles are broad and strong, especially in the front, where they coalesce with the sides of the body and the root of the odontoid process. They are covered above by the superior articular surfaces.

The laminae are thick and strong. They play a large role in the stability of the cervical spine alongside the laminae of C7.

The vertebral foramen is large, but smaller than the atlas.

The transverse processes are very small, and each ends in a single tubercle. Each process is perforated by the transverse foramen, which is directed obliquely upward and laterally.

The superior articular surfaces are round, slightly convex, directed upward and laterally, and are supported on the body, pedicles, and transverse processes.

The inferior articular surfaces have the same direction as those of the other cervical vertebrae.

The superior vertebral notches are very shallow, and lie behind the articular processes. The inferior vertebral notches lie in front of the articular processes, as in the other cervical vertebrae.

The spinous process is large, very strong, deeply channelled on its under surface, and presents a bifurcated extremity.

===Variation===
Contact sports are contraindicated for individuals with anomalous dens, as any violent impact may result in a catastrophic injury. This is because a malformed odontoid process may lead to instability between the atlas and axis (the C1 and C2 cervical vertebrae).

===Development===

The axis is ossified from five primary and two secondary centres.

The body and vertebral arch are ossified in the same manner as the corresponding parts in the other vertebrae, viz., one centre for the body, and two for the vertebral arch.

The centres for the arch appear about the seventh or eighth week of fetal life, while the centres for the body appear in about the fourth or fifth month.

The dens, or odontoid process, consists originally of a continuation upward of the cartilaginous mass, in which the lower part of the body is formed.

During about the sixth month of fetal life, two centres make their appearance in the base of this process: they are placed laterally, and join before birth to form a conical bilobed mass deeply cleft above; the interval between the sides of the cleft and the summit of the process is formed by a wedge-shaped piece of cartilage.

The base of the process is separated from the body by a cartilaginous disk, which gradually becomes ossified at its circumference, but remains cartilaginous in its center until advanced age.

In this cartilage, rudiments of the lower epiphyseal plate of the atlas, and the upper epiphyseal plate of the axis may sometimes be found.

The apex of the dens has a separate centre that appears in the second and joins about the twelfth year; this is the upper epiphyseal plate of the atlas.

In addition to these, there is a secondary centre for a thin epiphyseal plate on the undersurface of the body of the bone.

==Clinical significance==

===Fractures===

A fracture of both pedicles of the axis is termed a Hangman&#x27;s fracture.
Fractures of the dens are classified into three categories according to the Anderson Alonso system:
* Type I fracture - Extends through the tip of the dens. This type is usually stable.
* Type II fracture - Extends through the base of the dens. It is the most commonly encountered fracture for this region of the axis. This type is unstable and has a high rate of non-union.
* Type III fracture - Extends through the vertebral body of the axis. This type can be stable or unstable and may require surgery.

<text>The Saab 9-5 is an executive car that was produced by the Swedish automobile maker Saab from 1997 to 2012.

The first generation 9-5 was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year, as the replacement of the Saab 9000. At the time, the car represented a significant development for the manufacturer. In the United States, the 9-5 was introduced in the spring of 1998, for the 1999 model year.

The second generation was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 15, 2009 and production began in March 2010. It was the first Saab autombile to be launched under Spyker Cars&#x27; ownership, even though it was developed almost completely under GM&#x27;s ownership. Production ceased in 2012 amid the Saab&#x27;s liquidation.

==Overview==
Saab badged the model as the Saab 95, but consistently advertised it as the Saab 9-5, pronounced &quot;nine five&quot; rather than &quot;ninety-five&quot;. This model should not be confused with the Saab 95, produced from 1959 to 1978.

The first generation 9-5 was available with sedan and station wagon body styles. Aerodynamically, the sedan&#x27;s drag coefficient is 0.29, and the station wagon&#x27;s is 0.31 (0.33 for the U.S. version). Introduced in 1999, the wagon features innovations such as floor tracks to secure cargo and a sliding load floor to make loading easier.

The 9-5 was the first production vehicle to offer ventilated seats, as well as asymmetrical turbocharging in the case of the 3.0L V6 engine.

The last 9-5 sedan of the first generation rolled off the Trollhättan production line at the beginning of July 2009, and the last wagon was assembled on February 1, 2010. Between the summer of 1997, when 9-5 production began, and 2010, 252,236 sedans, and 231,357 wagons were built. The total production 483,593 units, was narrowly beaten by its predecessor, the 9000, of which 503,000 were built.

Production equipment for the first-generation 9-5 was sold by General Motors to BAIC Group of China in 2009.
==First generation (YS3E, 1997–2010)==
===Engines===
The first-generation 9-5 is powered by Saab&#x27;s B205 and B235 straight-4 engines, and from 2002 in Europe by an Opel Ecotec X22DTH 2.2 diesel engine (Saab D223L), replaced in 2006 by Fiat&#x27;s 1.9 JTD 16V diesel engine. A turbocharged version of the General Motors 54° V6 engine, designated by Saab as B308, has a unique asymmetrical low-pressure turbocharger and was available from 1999 to 2003. This engine is available only with an automatic transmission, and cars with this engine installed are distinguishable by their twin tailpipes. The V6 was only available on Arc, SE, and Griffin models. In 2004, the V6 engine was replaced by a high-pressure turbo straight-4 engine rated at . By 2006 this engine was rated at even in the non-Aero or non-sport models made for the US market.

The B2x5 engines can suffer from oil pickup issues caused by &#x27;oil sludge&#x27; in the lubrication circuit. In 1999, Saab issued a Workshop Bulletin around this issue. The &#x27;sludge&#x27; issue primarily affected earlier models between 1999 and 2003, and from 2004 a revised engine positive crankcase ventilation system (PCV) and the use of fully synthetic oil were introduced.

Saab created retrofit kits for the earlier 1999–2003 cars as the PCV design differs from the 2004 and later system. In 2005, Saab extended the warranty on the B2x5 engine to eight years and unlimited miles from new for original owners, provided the owner could produce proof that they had followed the manufacturer&#x27;s oil change intervals. Saab recommended the use of fully synthetic or synthetic-blend oil as a preventative measure.

====Engine choices====
===Transmissions===
The 9-5 is available with an Aisin AW 4-speed (50-42LE) automatic transmission Saab reference FA47; from 1997 until 2001, when a new Aisin AW unit replaced the aging four-speed automatic with a five-speed automatic. A five-speed manual transmission is fitted as standard to the base models and the Aero. 

===Alternative propulsion===

====E85====
In 2005, an updated version of the 2.0 L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine was introduced in the European market together with the 2006 9–5. The engine was sold as &quot;2.0t BioPower&quot;, optimized to run on E85 producing at 5,500 rpm. There was also a 2.3T BioPower version sold from 2007. It was also introduced in Australia.

====E100====
In 2007, Saab presented a 9-5 E100 Concept, based on the turbo 2.0. Offering a claimed and of torque, the Concept included the use of increased boost pressure and compression ratio.

===Safety===
The 9-5 introduced Saab&#x27;s Active Head Restraints (SAHR), which moved up and forward to prevent whiplash when the car was struck from the rear. This feature won technology and safety awards in Australia, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. The Saab 9-5 also was one of the first cars to have extensive side-crash protection.

The front seats featured torso airbags and head airbags even on the earliest models, which few contemporary vehicles did in the late 1990s. The basic structure included a robust passenger safety cage, front and rear deformation zones, reinforced door posts and pillars, as well as the &quot;Pendulum B-Pillar&quot;, which combined high-strength low-alloy steel at chest and head height with tailored blank steel at the floorpan, designed to direct the crash forces down toward the floor. The design was proven by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) to protect occupants in side crashes, even without the addition of curtain airbags or rear side airbags. From 2002, ESP (electronic stability control) was included as standard.

Another Saab feature, the &quot;Night Panel&quot;, permitted dousing of the instrument panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when driving at night. Once activated, only essential information such as current speed is displayed except, for example, if the car requires fuel or the engine overheats.

In the United States OnStar was available, and provided as standard equipment in selected 9-5&#x27;s from 2001 onward.

=== Comfort ===

The 9-5 had various comfort features both as standard and cost options over the years.

While early models frequently had dash mounted cassette decks, CD changers were standard features on many cars and in-dash satellite navigation was also available. Factory-fitted phone kits were similarly optional.

Many models featured leather or part-leather upholstery and both front and rear heated seats were also available. A few models were shipped with the optional ventilated seats.

Cruise control was available on various models and xenon headlamps were fitted as standard on high-end variants.

===Aero===

The high-performance variant is known as 9-5 Aero. The earliest versions of which were sometimes referred to as the &#x27;HOT&#x27; (High Output Turbo) Aero, was first released in 2000 with a 2.3T B235R engine. The B235R engine of the 9-5 Aero is capable of providing immense torque and, in terms of acceleration, which outperformed the contemporary Porsche 911 Turbo from 40 to 90 mph. Initially badged as a engine, Saab later conceded that the 230 PS power figure was quite conservative, with the manual versions rated at 250 PS and having more torque than stated. This flagship model had a long list of standard features, a sport tuned suspension, and body side moldings. In 2002 a 2.3-litre turbocharged engine was made standard, which allowed for more torque after 4,500 rpm. All Aero models from 2002 to 2005 have an identical engine layout and management system, with the 2002-05 models just having a slightly remapped version of that ECU from factory. The top-of-the-line 9-5 in its final model years is rated at and of torque ( with its 20-second overboost function accessible on the manual transmission equipped version).

From 2006 to 2010, the B235R was the standard engine in both the 2.3T and Aero trims. 2006 had only one badge designation, 2.3T, and appointments normally found on the Aero could be added via a &quot;Sport Package&quot;. Since 2007, SAAB added an Aero badge to the trunk lid to distinguish from regular 2.3T models. In addition, almost all standard features on the Aero were standard on the 2.3T, the exceptions being sport-tuned chassis, two-tone leather upholstery, &quot;Anniversary&quot; wheels and brushed aluminum interior trim, all of which were standard on Aero and not available on the 2.3T.

===Police car===
The 9-5 was used as a liveried patrol vehicle, as well as undercover, in several parts of its native Sweden, alongside the Volvo V70. Several police forces in the UK also used the 9–5 in their fleets, mostly in Aero specification. The city of Aspen, Colorado, used Saabs as patrol cars from early 1970s until 2005, when they discontinued the 9–5 in favor of the Volvo XC90. The town of Vail, Colorado likewise used Saabs from 1980 onwards, but in 2005, the black 9-5 patrol cars were replaced by Ford Explorers, due to budget reasons.

In 2006, Lothian and Borders Police in Edinburgh, Scotland, began operating three Saab 9-5 Aero 2.3T patrol cars as part of a fleet of 580 vehicles. These 9-5s were customised to police specifications by the Saab, Vauxhall and Chevrolet Special Vehicles Operation (SVO) in Papworth, Cambridgeshire. In undercover guise, these cars were outwardly identical to the Linear Sport models, but featured the 260 hp Aero drivetrain.

In Poland, an unmarked 9-5 is used as a video-pursuit vehicle, in the Płock area.

==Second generation (YS3G, 2010–2012)==
The second generation 9-5, built on the Global Epsilon platform was presented at the Frankfurt International Auto Show in September 2009. The vehicle had its North American debut in October 2009 at the South Florida Auto Show in Miami.
On November 24, 2009, the first pre-production second generation 9-5 rolled off the Trollhättan production line.

With the announcement of the sale of Saab to Spyker on January 26, 2010, the new generation Saab 9-5 was put into production at the Saab plant in Trollhättan. Full-scale production began in April 2010, with the cars appearing in dealerships on June 19, 2010. Saab introduced a wagon variant of the new 9-5, dubbed &quot;SportCombi,&quot; at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The Saab 9-5 Sedan 2.8 V6 Turbo was named Car of the Year in Singapore by &quot;Wheels Asia&quot;.

Production of the 9-5 ended in March 2011 with Trollhättan production stopping due to the company&#x27;s failing liquidity. Total production numbers of the second-generation Saab 9-5 amounted to 11,280 units.

While several prototype vehicles and a number of pre-production SportCombis were manufactured, the official variant did not enter serial production prior to Saab&#x27;s bankruptcy in December 2011. A 9-5 liftback and a new 9-5X were also planned, as well as an overall facelift around mid-2014.

=== Trim levels ===
Trim/equipment levels vary from country to country.

In the US, Saab 9-5 trim levels were Turbo4, Turbo4 Premium, Turbo6 XWD, and Aero. Turbo4 models come with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and features that included power adjustable driver and passenger seats, leather upholstery, five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lamps, and rain-sensing wipers. The Turbo4 Premium added a panoramic sunroof, headlamp washers, Saab parking assistance, keyless entry and start, memory seats, and 18-inch alloy wheels, while the Turbo6 XWD was powered by a turbocharged six-cylinder engine and features an all-wheel-drive system. The top trim Aero featured 15-spoke “Rotor” 18-inch alloy wheels, leather-trimmed sports seats, a multi-color central information display, Bi-Xenon SmartBeam headlamps, dark titanium-effect interior trim, aluminum sports pedals, a sports-tuned suspension system with real-time damping, and Aero exterior elements.

UK equipment levels for the 2012 model year included the Vector SE and Aero. The previous base models, Linear and Vector were replaced by the Vector SE model.

In Australia the base trim called Linear was not part of the line up, only the Vector and Aero trims were available.

===Engines===
In North America, the engine choices were either a turbocharged V6 or an Ecotec I4. Other countries also had an optional turbodiesel I4 engine. Engine performance upgrades that were available from Hirsch Performance (Saab&#x27;s only factory approved tuner) increased the power of the V6 engine to from and the I4 engine to from .

===Reviews===
*&quot;Auto Express&quot; &lt;br&gt;For: spacious cabin, distinctive styling, well equipped.&lt;br&gt;Against: poor residuals, driving dynamics, cheap cabin materials.
*Auto Trader &lt;br&gt;Pros: low and high mpg, distinctive design, plenty of room.&lt;br&gt;Cons: interior quality disappointing, outclassed by rivals, holds value poorly.
*&quot;Parker&#x27;s&quot; &lt;br&gt;Pros: Much kit as standard, high-tech features, driver comfort, practicality.&lt;br&gt;Cons: Not particularly sporty, still lacks the brand appeal of its German rivals.
*The AA &lt;br&gt;Likes: styling typically Saab but updated for the modern era; comfortable seats are a Saab trademark; cabin space is first rate - especially rear legroom; sensible pricing for the mainstream variants.&lt;br&gt;Gripes: simple styling could be viewed as bland by uncharitable critics; can&#x27;t match Jaguar&#x27;s XF for sporting character; clutter-free cabin is welcome but quality of materials chosen could have been better; auto gearbox option could be more responsive.

<doc id="331101" wikidata="Q17062395" url="?curid=331101" title="The Winner Records">
<text>The Winner Records was a United Kingdom-based record label from 1912 onwards. Its records were manufactured by the Edison Bell Record Works, London. This company, founded by James Hough, had originated in the early 1890s as an importer of Edison and Columbia phonograph cylinders; from 1898 Hough had also made cylinder records, initially using a separate company, Edisonia. When Edison set up his own European operation in 1904, the import franchise was withdrawn, but the name Edison Bell remained in use. From 1909 the official name of Edison-Bell was J. E. Hough Ltd.

Winner Records were designed to offer well-recorded and pressed gramophone records at a budget price. Winner records, with black or red labels, were mostly of a popular music type, although they included some items of musical distinction, such as early recordings by John Barbirolli, then a child-prodigy performer on the violoncello, and nearly all of the discography of Marie Novello, one of the last students of Theodor Leschetizky. In the early 1920s the company introduced a higher-quality series, Velvet Face Records, so called because the material of which they were made was allegedly smoother than that used by other manufacturers. These had green labels, and the catalogue included some ambitious items, such as an abridged version (1925) of Edward Elgar&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; and, from Novello, what has been reported as the first recording of Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 (arranged for piano by Carl Tausig) and a complete recording of Mendelssohn&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, her sole recording of a work extending over more than two record sides.

In 1919, Winner was the first to issue a recording by a jazz band.

All recordings prior to 1922 were made by Edison Bell in London. Subsequently, several recordings were leased from Star Piano Company, Emerson Records, and Paramount Records. Subsequent to 1925, recordings from Crown and Plaza Music Company were used.

Edison-Bell was eventually absorbed by England-based company Decca Records. Decca introduced a new series of Winner records that were primarily sourced from American Vocalion. These were discontinued January 1935. More than 3500 Winner gramophone discs had been issued. A full listing of Winner records is published by the CLPGS.

<text>The Saab 95 is a seven-seater, two-door station wagon produced by Swedish automaker Saab from 1959 to 1978.

Initially it was based on the Saab 93 sedan, but the model&#x27;s development throughout the years followed closely that of the Saab 96, the successor of the Saab 93 from 1960. It was introduced in 1959, but because only 40 were made in 1959, production is often said to have started in 1960.

The first engine was an 841 cc three-cylinder two-stroke, but from 1967 onward, it became available with the same four-stroke Ford Taunus V4 engine as available for the Saab 96 and used in the Saab Sonett V4 and Sonett III. It had a four-speed manual transmission. There was a small handle on the firewall that, when pushed, put the car into a &quot;freewheeling&quot; mode. This allowed the driver to coast downhill without seizing the two-stroke engine, but when power was needed the transmission would engage and the driver could power the car up hill again. As the 95 received the four-speed gearbox before the 96 (that still had the old three-speed unit) it was also used for rallying.

In the US, the Saab 95 received the larger 1.7 litre V4 for the 1971 model year, as a response to tighter emissions regulations. The compression ratio was lowered to 8.0:1, meaning that the power remained at . The Saab 95/96 remained on sale in the United States until 1973.

A rear-facing folding seat was dropped with the 1976 model year, making the car a regular five-seater. Production ended in 1978 (when only 470 examples were built). A total of 110,527 were made.

For certain markets (Norway, Denmark) a special export version sedan delivery van was available without a rear seat and rear side windows.

<doc id="331105" wikidata="Q146496" url="?curid=331105" title="Stjepan Mesić">
<text>Stjepan &quot;Stipe&quot; Mesić (; born 24 December 1934) is a Croatian lawyer and politician who served as the president of Croatia from 2000 to 2010. Before serving two five-year terms as president, he was prime minister of SR Croatia (1990) after the first multi-party elections, the last president of the Presidency of Yugoslavia (1991) and consequently secretary general of the Non-Aligned Movement (1991), as well as the speaker of the Croatian Parliament (1992–1994), and mayor of his hometown of Orahovica.

Mesić was a deputy in the Croatian Parliament in the 1960s, and was then absent from politics until 1990 when he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and was named President of the Executive Council (Prime Minister) of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (then still a constituent republic of the SFR Yugoslavia) after HDZ won the elections. His cabinet is, despite holding office before Croatia&#x27;s independence, considered by the Government of Croatia to have been the first government cabinet of the current Croatian republic. He later resigned from his post and was appointed to serve as the Socialist Republic of Croatia&#x27;s membership of the Yugoslav federal presidency where he served first as vice president and then in 1991 as the last President of Yugoslavia before Yugoslavia dissolved.

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia and Croatia&#x27;s independence, Mesić served as Speaker of the Croatian Parliament from 1992 to 1994, when he left HDZ. With several other members of parliament, he formed a new party called Croatian Independent Democrats (HND). In 1997 the majority of HND members, including Mesić, merged into the Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS).

After Franjo Tuđman died in December 1999, Mesić won the elections to become the next president of Croatia in February 2000. He was the last Croatian president to serve under a strong semi-presidential system, which foresaw the president as the most powerful official in the government structure and allowed him to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and his cabinet. This system was abolished in favor of an incomplete parliamentary system, which retained the direct election of the president but greatly reduced his powers in favor of strengthening the office of Prime Minister. He was reelected in January 2005 for a second five-year term. Mesić always topped the polls for the most popular politician in Croatia during his two terms.

==Early life and education==
Stjepan Mesić, commonly called &quot;Stipe&quot;, was born in Orahovica, Yugoslavia to Josip and Magdalena (née Pernar) Mesić. After his mother died in 1936, his older sister Marija was sent to their uncle Tomo Pernar in France, while Stjepan was put in the care of his grandmother Marija until his father was remarried in 1938 to Mileva Jović, an ethnic Serb who gave birth to Slavko and Jelica.

His father joined the Yugoslav Partisans in 1941. The Mesić family spent most of the Second World War in refuges in Mount Papuk and Orahovica when it was occasionally liberated. In 1945, the family took refuge from the final fighting of the war in Hungary, along with 10,000 other refugees, and subsequently settled in Našice, where Josip Mesić became the chairman of the District Council. The family soon moved to Osijek, where Stipe graduated from 4-year elementary school and finished two years of 8-year gymnasium.

In 1949, his father was reassigned back to Orahovica, and Stipe continued his education at the gymnasium in Požega. He graduated in 1955 and, as an exemplary student, was admitted to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The same year on 17 March, his father died of cancer.

Stjepan Mesić continued his studies at the Law Faculty at the University of Zagreb, where he graduated in 1961. That same year, Mesić married Milka Dudunić, of Ukrainian and Serbian ethnic origin from Hrvatska Kostajnica, with whom he has two daughters. After graduation, he worked as an intern at the municipal court in Orahovica and the public attorney&#x27;s office at Našice. He served his compulsory military service in Bileća and Niš, becoming a reserve officer.

==Career==
In 1966, Mesić ran as an independent candidate in the election for his municipal council, and defeated two other candidates. In 1967, he became the mayor of Orahovica and a member of the Parliament of SR Croatia.

In 1967, as mayor, Mesić attempted the building of a private factory in the town, the first private factory in Yugoslavia. However, this was personally denounced by Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito as an attempt to silently introduce capitalism, which was illegal under the then-existing constitution.

===Croatian spring===
In 1967, when a group of Croatian nationalists published &quot;Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language&quot;, Mesić publicly denounced it as a diversionary attack against the very foundations of Yugoslavia and called for its authors to be prosecuted by law.

However, in the 1970s Mesić supported the nationalist Croatian Spring movement which called for Croatian equality within the Yugoslav Federation on economic, political and cultural levels. The government indicted him for &quot;acts of enemy propaganda&quot;. The initial trial lasted three days in which 55 witnesses testified, only five against him, but he was sentenced to 20 years in jail on charges that he was a member of a Croatian terrorist group. He appealed and the trial was prolonged, but in 1975 he was incarcerated for one year and served his sentence at the Stara Gradiška prison.

===Return to politics===
Mesić was elected again in 1990 as a candidate of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in the first multi-party elections in Croatia after World War II. He became the general secretary of HDZ and later the Prime Minister of Croatia. He served in this post from May to August 1990, when he resigned to become the vice-president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY).

Presidents rotated annually among the six republics of Yugoslavia. When Mesić&#x27;s turn came to become president on 15 May 1991, the Serbian incumbent Member Borisav Jović demanded, against all constitutional rules, that an election be held. The members from Serbia and its provinces voted against, and the member from Montenegro abstained, leaving Mesić one vote short of the majority. Under pressure from the international community after the Ten-Day War in Slovenia, Mesić was appointed on 1 July 1991.

As Yugoslav President, Mesić also held the position of Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement, superseding Jović. In October 1991, at the height of Siege of Dubrovnik, Mesić and Croatian Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić led a relief convoy of forty fishing and tour boats to Dubrovnik.

Despite being the head of state of the SFRY, Mesić did not attend many sessions of the collective presidency as it was dominated by four members loyal to Serbia. He was also unable to re-assert control as commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, as his orders for them to return to barracks were ignored and they acted independently. On 5 December 1991, Mesić declared his post irrelevant and resigned from the Presidency, returning to Croatia. In a statement to Croatian Parliament, he said: &quot;I think I&#x27;ve accomplished my duty, Yugoslavia no longer exist[s] anymore&quot;.

After 1992 Croatian parliamentary election, Mesić became the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament. He served as the Speaker from 7 September 1992 to 24 May 1994.

In April 1994, Mesić left the HDZ and formed a new party with Josip Manolić, the Croatian Independent Democrats (&quot;Hrvatski Nezavisni Demokrati&quot;, HND). Mesić stated that this decision was motivated by his disagreement with Croatia&#x27;s policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, specifically Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s alleged agreement with Slobodan Milošević in the Milošević–Tuđman Karađorđevo meeting to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia and the subsequent launch of the Croat–Bosniak War.

Earlier, in 1992, Mesić visited Široki Brijeg in order to dismiss Stjepan Kljujić and install Mate Boban as the president of HDZ BiH, the party&#x27;s branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mesić later described Boban as a radical nationalist and even &quot;crazy&quot;.

Mesić criticized the failed policies of privatization during the war and unresolved cases of war profiteering. In 1997 he and a part of the HND membership merged into the liberal Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS), where Mesić became an executive vice-president.

===Presidency of Croatia===

Mesić was elected President of the Republic of Croatia in the 2000 election after winning the first round and defeating Dražen Budiša of HSLS in the second round. Mesić ran as the joint candidate of the HNS, HSS, LS and IDS. He received 41% of the vote in the first round and 56% in the second round. After becoming president, he stepped down from membership in the HNS.

He heavily criticized former President Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s policies as &quot;nationalistic and authoritarian&quot;, lacking a free media and employing bad economics, while Mesić favored a more liberal approach to opening the Croatian economy to foreign investment. In September 2000 Mesić retired seven Croatian active generals who had written two open letters to the public arguing that the current government administration &quot;is campaigning to criminalize Homeland War and that the Government is accusing and neglecting the Croatian Army&quot;. Mesić held that active duty officers could not write public political letters without approval of their Commander-in-Chief. Opposition parties condemned this as a dangerous decision that could harm Croatian national security. Mesić later retired four more generals for similar reasons.
As president, Mesić was active in foreign policy. Mesić promoted Croatia&#x27;s ambition to become a member of the European Union and NATO. He also initiated mutual apologies for possible war crimes with the President of Serbia and Montenegro. After Constitutional amendments in September 2000, he was deprived of most of his roles in domestic policy-making, which instead passed wholly to the Croatian Government and its Premier.

Mesić testified at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that implicated the Croatian army in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The right-wing parts of the Croatian public took issue with this, saying that his testimony contained untrue statements and questioned his motives (he was often branded &quot;traitor&quot;), and noting that much of his testimony occurred before his presidency, as an opposition politician. His denunciation of the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on 12 March 2003 marked a notable thawing of relations with Serbia, and he attended his funeral in Belgrade.

He opposed the United States&#x27; military campaign against Iraq and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime without gaining United Nations approval or mandate beforehand. Immediately following the invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003, Mesić deplored that by attacking Iraq, the Bush administration had marginalized UN, induced divisions in EU, damaged relationships with traditional allies, disturbed the foundations of international order and incited a crisis, which could spill over the borders of Iraq.

Mesić improved Croatian foreign relations with Libya by exchanging visits with the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, contrary to the wishes of U.S. and British diplomacy.

The first of Mesić&#x27;s mandate was not marked with historically crucial events like the Tuđman presidency had been, Croatia&#x27;s public political orientation shifted away from the HDZ, mostly to the benefit of leftist parties. When the government changed hands in late 2003, problems were expected between the leftist President and a Government with rightist members, but Mesić handled the situation gracefully and there were few notable incidents in this regard. He served his first 5-year term until February 2005. In the 2005 election, Mesić was a candidate supported by eight political parties and won nearly half of the vote, but was denied the absolute majority by a few percent. Mesić faced off with Jadranka Kosor in the run-off election and won. He served his second 5-year term until 2010 when he was superseded by Ivo Josipović.

On 1 March 2006 the Civic Assembly of Podgorica, Montenegro&#x27;s capital, decided to declare Mesić an honorary citizen. The move was opposed by pro-Serbian parties in Montenegro.

In December 2006, a controversy arose when a video was published showing Mesić during a speech in Australia in the early 1990s, where he said that the Croats &quot;won a victory on April 10th&quot; (when the fascist aligned Independent State of Croatia was formed) &quot;as well as in 1945&quot; (when the communist anti-fascists prevailed and the Socialist Republic of Croatia was formed), as well as that Croatia needed to apologize to no one for the Jasenovac concentration camp. Another 1990s-era speech by Mesić sparked controversy on the issue, where he claimed that not all Croats fighting for the Independent State of Croatia were Ustashe supporters and claimed that most were fighting legitimately for Croatian independence. However, in the 2000s Mesić clearly described the persecutions of Serbs in Independent State of Croatia as genocide. In 2017, another recording from 1992 was published, with Mesić talking how Jasenovac wasn&#x27;t a &quot;death camp&quot;, denying the nature of the concentration camp, and other statements considered supportive of the Ustaše. The same year, Mesić apologized for &quot;the imprudent statement&quot; and relativization of the crimes in Jasenovac.

On 21 December 2008, President Mesić compared Dodik&#x27;s policies to those of the late Serbian President Slobodan Milošević at the beginning of the 1990s. &quot;Just as the world failed to recognize Milošević&#x27;s policy then, it does not recognize Dodik&#x27;s policy today,&quot; he said. Explaining where such a policy could be headed, he added: &quot;If Dodik manages to merge Republika Srpska with Serbia, all Croats concentrated in Herzegovina will want to join Croatia in the same manner, leaving a rump Bosniak country, surrounded by enemies. If this were to occur, that small country would become the refuge of all the world&#x27;s terrorists.&quot;

Mesić has been accused by the Croatian Helsinki Committee of obstructing the investigation of war crimes committed by the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. The committee also accused Mesić of abusing the commemorations at the Jasenovac concentration camp for political purposes.

In 2009, he publicly proposed that all crucifixes be removed from Croatian state offices, provoking a negative reaction from the Catholic Church in Croatia.

===Lawsuits===
In 2006, Mesić told the Croatian press that Croatian-French lawyer Ivan Jurasinović should visit the psychiatric clinic at Vrapče, after Jurasinović filed charges for Marin Tomulić against Marko Nikolić and others for attempted murder. Jurasinović subsequently launched a civil suit against Mesić which found the president guilty of using his position to attempt to discredit and slander him. Mesić was ordered to compensate Jurasinović 70,000 kunas.

In April 2008 Josip Kokić unsuccessfully petitioned the Croatian Constitutional Court to remove the president&#x27;s legal immunity, so that he could sue him. Ivan Jurasinović launched another appeal to remove the immunity in November 2008.

In 2008, former Constitutional Court judge Vice Vukojević launched a case against Mesić, alleging that he embezzled money along with Vladimir Sokolić under the guise of purchasing vehicles for the Croatian Army in 1993.

Political scientist and publisher Darko Petričić claimed that Mesić&#x27;s first campaign in 2000 was funded by the Albanian mafia. In 2009 Mesić filed a lawsuit for defamation but it was decided in Petričić&#x27;s favor on 29 March 2012.

In 2015, a court in Hämeenlinna, Finland, sentenced two executives of Finnish company Patria – executive vice president for Croatia Heiki Hulkonen and representative for Croatia Reiji Niittynen – for bribing Croatian officials in making a €112 million contract with Croatian company Đuro Đaković. Each received a suspended sentence of eight years, eight months in prison and a €300,000 fine. Director of sales, Tuomas Korpi, was acquitted. According to the charge, Patria&#x27;s managers gained €1.6 million through Hans Wolfgang Riedl and Walter Wolf as mediators, and used this money to bribe Croatia&#x27;s president Mesić and director of the Đuro Đaković company Bartol Jerković.

=== Political activities after the end of the presidential mandate ===
Former Croatian President Mesić, together with former President of Montenegro Vujanovic, former President of Slovenia Turk, former President of Albania Moisiu, former President of Serbia Micic and other politicians from the region, founded the &quot;Podgorica Club&quot; in Podgorica, Montenegro at the beginning of 2019. The Podgorica club is a political initiative of former presidents and prime ministers from the region. 

Former President Mesić also participated, together with former presidents and prime ministers from Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the Inaugural Conference of the International Association of Parliamentarians for Peace in September 2017 in Pristina, Kosovo.

<text>A contig (from &quot;contiguous&quot;) is a set of overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA.
In bottom-up sequencing projects, a contig refers to overlapping sequence data (reads); in top-down sequencing projects, contig refers to the overlapping clones that form a physical map of the genome that is used to guide sequencing and assembly. Contigs can thus refer both to overlapping DNA sequences and to overlapping physical segments (fragments) contained in clones depending on the context.

==Original definition of contig==

In 1980, Staden wrote: &quot;In order to make it easier to talk about our data gained by the shotgun method of sequencing we have invented the word &quot;contig&quot;. A contig is a set of gel readings that are related to one another by overlap of their sequences. All gel readings belong to one and only one contig, and each contig contains at least one gel reading. The gel readings in a contig can be summed to form a contiguous consensus sequence and the length of this sequence is the length of the contig.&quot;

==Sequence contigs==

A sequence contig is a continuous (not contiguous) sequence resulting from the reassembly of the small DNA fragments generated by bottom-up sequencing strategies. This meaning of contig is consistent with the original definition by Rodger Staden (1979). The bottom-up DNA sequencing strategy involves shearing genomic DNA into many small fragments (&quot;bottom&quot;), sequencing these fragments, reassembling them back into contigs and eventually the entire genome (&quot;up&quot;). Because current technology allows for the direct sequencing of only relatively short DNA fragments (300–1000 nucleotides), genomic DNA must be fragmented into small pieces prior to sequencing. In bottom-up sequencing projects, amplified DNA is sheared randomly into fragments appropriately sized for sequencing. The subsequent sequence reads, which are the data that contain the sequences of the small fragments, are put into a database. The assembly software then searches this database for pairs of overlapping reads. Assembling the reads from such a pair (including, of course, only one copy of the identical sequence) produces a longer contiguous read (contig) of sequenced DNA. By repeating this process many times, at first with the initial short pairs of reads but then using increasingly longer pairs that are the result of previous assembly, the DNA sequence of an entire chromosome can be determined.

Today, it is common to use paired-end sequencing technology where both ends of &quot;consistently sized&quot; longer DNA fragments are sequenced. Here, a contig still refers to any contiguous stretch of sequence data created by read overlap. Because the fragments are of known length, the distance between the two end reads from each fragment is known. This gives additional information about the orientation of contigs constructed from these reads and allows for their assembly into scaffolds in a process called scaffolding.

Scaffolds consist of overlapping contigs separated by gaps of known length. The new constraints placed on the orientation of the contigs allows for the placement of highly repeated sequences in the genome. If one end read has a repetitive sequence, as long as its mate pair is located within a contig, its placement is known. The remaining gaps between the contigs in the scaffolds can then be sequenced by a variety of methods, including PCR amplification followed by sequencing (for smaller gaps) and BAC cloning methods followed by sequencing for larger gaps.

==BAC contigs==
Contig can also refer to the overlapping clones that form a physical map of a chromosome when the top-down or hierarchical sequencing strategy is used. In this sequencing method, a low-resolution map is made prior to sequencing in order to provide a framework to guide the later assembly of the sequence reads of the genome. This map identifies the relative positions and overlap of the clones used for sequencing. Sets of overlapping clones that form a contiguous stretch of DNA are called contigs; the minimum number of clones that form a contig that covers the entire chromosome comprise the tiling path that is used for sequencing. Once a tiling path has been selected, its component BACs are sheared into smaller fragments and sequenced. Contigs therefore provide the framework for hierarchical sequencing.

The assembly of a contig map involves several steps. First, DNA is sheared into larger (50–200kb) pieces, which are cloned into BACs or PACs to form a BAC library. Since these clones should cover the entire genome/chromosome, it is theoretically possible to assemble a contig of BACs that covers the entire chromosome. Reality, however, is not always ideal. Gaps often remain, and a scaffold—consisting of contigs and gaps—that covers the map region is often the first result. The gaps between contigs can be closed by various methods outlined below.

===Construction of BAC contigs===
BAC contigs are constructed by aligning BAC regions of known overlap via a variety of methods. One common strategy is to use sequence-tagged site (STS) content mapping to detect unique DNA sites in common between BACs. The degree of overlap is roughly estimated by the number of STS markers in common between two clones, with more markers in common signifying a greater overlap. Because this strategy provides only a very rough estimate of overlap, restriction digest fragment analysis, which provides a more precise measurement of clone overlap, is often used. In this strategy, clones are treated with one or two restriction enzymes and the resulting fragments separated by gel electrophoresis. If two clones, they will likely have restriction sites in common, and will thus share several fragments. Because the number of fragments in common and the length of these fragments is known (the length is judged by comparison to a size standard), the degree of overlap can be deduced to a high degree of precision.

===Gaps between contigs===
Gaps often remain after initial BAC contig construction. These gaps occur if the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library screened has low complexity, meaning it does not contain a high number of STS or restriction sites, or if certain regions were less stable in cloning hosts and thus underrepresented in the library. If gaps between contigs remain after STS landmark mapping and restriction fingerprinting have been performed, the sequencing of contig ends can be used to close these gaps. This end-sequencing strategy essentially creates a novel STS with which to screen the other contigs. Alternatively, the end sequence of a contig can be used as a primer to primer walk across the gap.

<doc id="331124" wikidata="Q45772" url="?curid=331124" title="Christian Bale">
<text>Christian Charles Philip Bale (born 30 January 1974) is an English-American actor. Known for his versatility and physical transformations for his roles, he has been a leading man in films of several genres. He has received various accolades, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked him as one of the highest-paid actors in 2014.

Born in Wales to English parents, Bale had his breakthrough role at age 13 in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1987 war film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. After more than a decade of leading and supporting roles in films, he gained wider recognition for his portrayals of serial killer Patrick Bateman in the black comedy &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000) and the title role in the thriller &quot;The Machinist&quot; (2004). He played superhero Batman in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy (2005–2012), one of the highest-grossing film franchises.

Outside his work as Batman, Bale had starring roles in a range of films, including Nolan&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), the action film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009), the crime drama &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009), and the epic film &quot;&quot; (2014). For his portrayal of boxer Dicky Eklund in David O. Russell&#x27;s biographical film &quot;The Fighter&quot; (2010), he won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Further Academy Award nominations came for his work in Russell&#x27;s black comedy &quot;American Hustle&quot; (2013) and Adam McKay&#x27;s biographical satires &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015) and &quot;Vice&quot; (2018). His portrayal of politician Dick Cheney in &quot;Vice&quot; won him a second Golden Globe Award. Bale has since played Ken Miles in the sports drama &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; (2019) and Gorr the God Butcher in the superhero film &quot;&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Christian Charles Philip Bale was born on 30 January 1974 in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, to English parents—Jenny James, a circus performer, and David Bale, an entrepreneur and activist. Bale has remarked, &quot;I was born in Wales but I&#x27;m not Welsh—I&#x27;m English.&quot; He has two elder sisters, Sharon and Louise, and a half-sister from his father&#x27;s first marriage, Erin. One of his grandfathers was a comedian while the other was a stand-in for John Wayne. Bale and his family left Wales when he was two years old, and after living in Portugal and Oxfordshire, England, they settled in Bournemouth. As well as saying that the family had lived in 15 towns by the time he was 15, Bale described the frequent relocation as being driven by &quot;necessity rather than choice&quot; and acknowledged that it had a major influence on his career selection. He attended Bournemouth School, later saying he left school at age 16. Bale&#x27;s parents divorced in 1991, and at age 17, he moved with his sister Louise and their father to Los Angeles.

Bale trained in ballet as a child. His first acting role came at eight years old in a commercial for the fabric softener Lenor. He also appeared in a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; cereal commercial. After his sister was cast in a West End musical, Bale considered taking up acting professionally. He said later he did not find acting appealing but pursued it at the request of those around him because he had no reason not to do so. After participating in school plays, Bale performed opposite Rowan Atkinson in the play &quot;The Nerd&quot; in the West End in 1984. He did not undergo any formal acting training.

==Career==
===Early roles and breakthrough (1986–1999)===
After deciding to become an actor at age ten, Bale secured a minor role in the 1986 television film &quot;&quot;. Its star, Amy Irving, who was married to director Steven Spielberg, subsequently recommended Bale for Spielberg&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. At age 13, Bale was chosen from over 4,000 actors to portray a British boy in a World War II Japanese internment camp. For the film, he spoke with an upper-class cadence without the help of a dialogue coach. The role propelled Bale to fame, and his work earned him acclaim and the inaugural Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. Earlier in the same year, he starred in the fantasy film &quot;Mio in the Land of Faraway&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Mio, My Son&quot; by Astrid Lindgren. The fame from &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; led to Bale being bullied in school and finding the pressures of working as an actor unbearable. He grew distrustful of the acting profession because of media attention but said that he felt obligated at a young age to continue to act for financial reasons. Around this time, actor and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh persuaded Bale to appear in his film &quot;Henry V&quot; in 1989, which drew him back into acting. The following year, Bale played Jim Hawkins opposite Charlton Heston as Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, a television film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s book of the same name.

Bale starred in the 1992 Disney musical film &quot;Newsies&quot;, which was unsuccessful both at the box office and with critics. Rebecca Milzoff of &quot;Vulture&quot; revisited the film in 2012 and found the cracks in Bale&#x27;s voice during his performance of the song &quot;Santa Fe&quot; charming and apt even though he was not a great singer. In 1993, he appeared in &quot;Swing Kids&quot;, a film about teenagers who secretly listen to forbidden jazz during the rise of Nazi Germany. In Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Little Women&quot;, Bale played Theodore &quot;Laurie&quot; Laurence following a recommendation from Winona Ryder, who starred as Jo March. The film achieved critical and commercial success. Of Bale&#x27;s performance, Ryder said he captured the complex nature of the role. He next voiced Thomas, a young compatriot of Captain John Smith, in the 1995 Disney animated film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, which attracted a mixed critical reception. Bale played a small part in the 1996 film &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, based on the Henry James novel of the same name, and appeared in the 1998 musical film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, set in the 1970s during the glam rock era. In 1999, he was part of an ensemble cast, which included Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer, portraying Demetrius in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name.

===Rise to prominence and commercial decline (2000–2004)===
Bale played Patrick Bateman, an investment banker and serial killer, in &quot;American Psycho&quot;, a film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by Mary Harron. While Harron had chosen Bale for the part, the film&#x27;s production and distribution company, Lionsgate, originally disagreed and hired Leonardo DiCaprio to play Bateman with Oliver Stone to direct. Bale and Harron were brought back after DiCaprio and Stone had left the project. Bale exercised and tanned himself for months to achieve Bateman&#x27;s chiseled physique and had his teeth capped to assimilate to the character&#x27;s narcissistic nature. &quot;American Psycho&quot; premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. Harron said critic Roger Ebert named it the most hated film at the event. Of Bale&#x27;s work, Ebert wrote he &quot;is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.&quot; The film was released in April 2000, becoming a commercial and critical success and later developing a cult following; the role established Bale as a leading man.

In the four years that followed &quot;American Psycho&quot;, Bale&#x27;s career experienced critical and commercial failure. He next played a villainous real estate heir in John Singleton&#x27;s action film &quot;Shaft&quot; and appeared in John Madden&#x27;s film adaptation of the Louis de Bernières novel &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; as Mandras, a Greek fisherman who vies with Nicolas Cage&#x27;s title character for the affections of Pelagia, played by Penélope Cruz. Bale said he found it refreshing to play Mandras, who is emotionally humane, after working on &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Shaft&quot;. In 2002, he appeared in three films: &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;, &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; and &quot;Equilibrium&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum called Bale&#x27;s performance &quot;fussy&quot;. After having reservations about joining the post-apocalyptic &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;, which involved computer-generated imagery, Bale professed his enjoyment of making films that could go awry and cited director Rob Bowman as a reason for his involvement. In &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, he plays a police officer in a futuristic society and performs gun kata, a fictional martial art that incorporates gunfighting. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeff Otto characterised &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; as &quot;poorly received&quot; and &quot;Equilibrium&quot; as &quot;highly underrated&quot;, while &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Stephen Applebaum described the two films along with &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; as &quot;mediocre fare&quot;.

Bale starred as the insomnia-ridden, emotionally dysfunctional title character in the psychological thriller &quot;The Machinist&quot;. To prepare for the role, he initially only smoked cigarettes and drank whiskey. His diet later expanded to include black coffee, an apple and a can of tuna per day. Bale lost , weighing to play the character, who was written in the script as &quot;a walking skeleton&quot;. His weight loss prompted comparisons with Robert De Niro&#x27;s weight gain in preparation to play Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. Describing his transformation as mentally calming, Bale claimed he had stopped working for a while because he did not come upon scripts that piqued his interest and that the film&#x27;s script drew him to lose weight for the part. &quot;The Machinist&quot; was released in October 2004; it performed poorly at the box office. Roger Moore of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; regarded it as one of the best films of the year, and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Bale&#x27;s &quot;haunted, aggressive and finally wrenching performance&quot; gave it a &quot;strong anchor&quot;.

===Batman and dramatic roles (2005–2008)===

Bale portrayed American billionaire Bruce Wayne and his superhero alias Batman in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, a reboot of the Batman film series. Nolan cast Bale, who was still fairly unknown at the time, because Bale had &quot;exactly the balance of darkness and light&quot; Nolan sought. For the part, Bale regained the weight he lost for &quot;The Machinist&quot; and built muscle, weighing . He trained in weapons, Wing Chun Kung Fu and the Keysi Fighting Method. Acknowledging the story&#x27;s peculiar circumstances involving a character &quot;who thinks he can run around in a batsuit in the middle of the night&quot;, Bale said he and Nolan had deliberately approached it with &quot;as realistic a motivation as possible&quot;, referencing Wayne&#x27;s parents&#x27; murder. Bale voiced Wayne and Batman differently. He employed gravelly tone qualities for Batman, which Nolan believed reinforced the character&#x27;s visual appearance. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was released in the US in June 2005. Tim Grierson and Will Leitch of &quot;Vulture&quot; complimented Bale&#x27;s &quot;sensitive, intelligent portrayal of a spoiled, wayward Bruce who finally grows up (and fights crime).&quot; The performance earned Bale the MTV Movie Award for Best Hero.

In the same year, Bale voiced the titular Howl, a wizard, in the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, a Japanese animated film adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s novel of the same name. He committed himself to voice the role after watching Miyazaki&#x27;s animated film &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Later that year, he starred as a US war veteran who deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the David Ayer-helmed crime drama &quot;Harsh Times&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He portrayed colonist John Rolfe in &quot;The New World&quot;, a historical drama film inspired by the stories of Pocahontas, directed by Terrence Malick. The film was released in December 2005. The following year saw the premiere of &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot;, by German filmmaker Werner Herzog, in which Bale portrayed US fighter pilot Dieter Dengler, who fights for his life after being shot down while on a mission during the Vietnam War. After the two worked together, Herzog stated that he had considered Bale to be among his generation&#x27;s greatest talents long before he played Batman. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Marjorie Baumgarten viewed Bale&#x27;s work as a continuance of his &quot;masterful command of yet another American personality type.&quot;

For the 2006 film &quot;The Prestige&quot;, Bale reunited with &quot;Batman Begins&quot; director Nolan, who said that Bale was cast after offering himself for the part. It is based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Priest about a rivalry between two Victorian era magicians, whom Bale and Hugh Jackman play in the film. While it attracted acclaim from critics, the film performed more modestly during its run in theatres, earning $110 million against a $40 million budget. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott highlighted Bale&#x27;s &quot;fierce inwardness&quot; and called his performance &quot;something to savor&quot;. Bale next starred in the 2007 drama films &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, portraying two incarnations of singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, and in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, playing a justice-seeking cattleman. He characterised his Dylan incarnations as &quot;two men on a real quest for truth&quot; and attributed his interest in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; to his affinity for films where he gets to &quot;just be dirty and crawling in the mud&quot;. Bale reprised the role of Batman in Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot; sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, which received acclaim and became the fourth film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide upon its July 2008 release. He did many of his own stunts, including one that involved standing on the roof of the Sears Tower in Chicago. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; has been regarded by critics as the best superhero film.

===The &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy completion and acclaim (2009–2012)===
In February 2008, Warner Bros. announced that Bale would star as rebellion leader John Connor in the post-apocalyptic action film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, directed by McG, who cited Bale as &quot;the most credible actor of his generation&quot;. In February 2009, an audio recording of a tirade on the film&#x27;s set in July 2008 involving Bale was released. It captured him directing profanities towards and threatening to attack the film&#x27;s cinematographer Shane Hurlbut, who walked onto the set during the filming of a scene acted by Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard, and culminated in Bale threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut was not fired. Several colleagues in the film industry defended Bale, attributing the incident to his dedication to acting. Bale publicly apologised in February 2009, calling the outburst &quot;inexcusable&quot; and his behaviour &quot;way out of order&quot; and affirming to have made amends with Hurlbut. &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; was released in May 2009 to tepid reviews. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; considered Bale&#x27;s work to be &quot;surprisingly one-dimensional&quot;, while &quot;The Age&quot;″s Jake Wilson wrote he gave one of his least compelling performances. Bale later admitted he knew during production that the film would not revitalise the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise as he had wished. He asserted he would not work with McG again.
Bale portrayed FBI agent Melvin Purvis opposite Johnny Depp as gangster John Dillinger in Michael Mann&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Public Enemies&quot;. Released in July 2009, it earned critical praise and had a commercially successful theatrical run. Dan Zak of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was unsatisfied with the casting of Bale and Depp, believing their characters&#x27; rivalry lacked electricity, while &quot;The New Republic&quot;″s Christopher Orr found Bale&#x27;s &quot;characteristically closed off&quot; performance &quot;nonetheless effective&quot;. The following year, Bale starred in the role of Dicky Eklund, a professional boxer whose career has ended due to his drug addiction, in David O. Russell&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Fighter&quot;. It chronicles the relationship between Eklund and his brother and boxing trainee, Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. To balance Eklund&#x27;s tragic condition, Bale incorporated humor in his characterisation. The portrayal, for which he lost , was acclaimed, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s Mick LaSalle describing it as &quot;shrewdly observed, physically precise and psychologically acute&quot;. Bale won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance. In 2011, he starred in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s historical drama film &quot;The Flowers of War&quot;, which was the highest-grossing Chinese film of the year. Critics described it as &quot;nationalistic&quot;, &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; and &quot;too long, too melodramatic, too lightweight&quot;.

Bale played Batman again under Christopher Nolan&#x27;s direction in the sequel &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, released in July 2012. He described Batman in the film as a remorseful recluse in poor mental and physical health, who has surrendered following the events of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Following the shooting at a midnight showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, Bale and his wife visited survivors, doctors and first responders at The Medical Center of Aurora as well as a memorial to victims. &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; was the 11th film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide, surpassing &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Nolan&#x27;s Batman film series, dubbed the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, is one of the highest-grossing film franchises. It is also regarded as one of the best comic book film franchises. Bale&#x27;s performance in the three films garnered universal acclaim, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, MovieWeb, &quot;NME&quot; and a poll conducted by the &quot;Radio Times&quot; ranking it as the best portrayal of Batman on film. Bale later revealed his dissatisfaction with his work throughout the trilogy, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t quite nail&quot; his part and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t quite manage&quot; what he had hoped he would as Batman.

===Continued critical success (2013–2019)===
In 2013, Bale played a steel mill worker in Scott Cooper&#x27;s thriller &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot;. Cooper rewrote the film&#x27;s script with Bale in mind before the two even met and would not proceed with the project without the actor&#x27;s involvement. Critics commended the film and deemed it an excellent beginning of the next phase in Bale&#x27;s career after playing Batman, with Kristopher Tapley of &quot;Variety&quot; noting his work in the film was his best. That same year, he starred in &quot;American Hustle&quot;, which reunited him with David O. Russell after their work on &quot;The Fighter&quot;. To play con artist Irving Rosenfeld, Bale studied footage of interviews with real-life con artist Mel Weinberg, who served as inspiration for the character. He gained , shaved part of his head and adopted a slouched posture, which reduced his height by and caused him to suffer a herniated disc. Russell indicated that Robert De Niro, who appeared in an uncredited role, did not recognise Bale when they were first introduced. Writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Joe Neumaier found Bale&#x27;s performance to be &quot;sad, funny and riveting&quot;. He was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his work.

Bale portrayed Moses in Ridley Scott&#x27;s epic film &quot;&quot;. Released in December 2014, the film faced accusations of whitewashing for the casting of Caucasian actors in Middle Eastern roles. Scott justified casting decisions citing financing needs, Bale stating that Scott had been forthright in getting the film made. Its critical response varied between negative and mixed, and the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;″s Joe Williams called Bale&#x27;s performance in the film the most apathetic of his career. Bale appeared in Terrence Malick&#x27;s drama &quot;Knight of Cups&quot;, which &quot;The Atlantic&quot; critic David Sims dubbed a &quot;noble failure&quot;. During its premiere at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2015, he said he filmed the project without having learned any dialogue and that Malick had only given him a character description. Later that year, he starred as Michael Burry, an antisocial hedge fund manager, in Adam McKay&#x27;s &quot;The Big Short&quot;, a biographical comedy-drama film about the financial crisis of 2007–08. He used an ocular prosthesis in the film. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Joe Morgenstern found his portrayal &quot;scarily hilarious—or in one-liners and quick takes, deftly edited&quot;. The role earned Bale Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.

In the 2016 historical drama &quot;The Promise&quot;, set during the Armenian genocide, he played an American journalist who becomes involved in a love triangle with a woman, played by Charlotte Le Bon, and an Armenian medical student, played by Oscar Isaac. Critics disapproved of the film, which accrued a $102 million loss. Reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that Bale appeared &quot;muffled and indistinct&quot;. In Cooper&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Hostiles&quot;, Bale starred as a US Army officer escorting a gravely ill Cheyenne war chief and his family back to their home in Montana. He calls the film &quot;a western with brutal, modern-day resonance&quot; and his character &quot;a bigoted and hate-filled man&quot;. Bale learned the Cheyenne language while working on the film. &quot;Empire&quot; critic Dan Jolin considered his performance striking and one of the strongest of his career. In 2018, Bale voiced Bagheera in the adventure film &quot;&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fear wrote that his voice work and that of Andy Serkis, who directed the film, &quot;bring the soul as well as sound and fury&quot;.
For the 2018 biographical comedy drama &quot;Vice&quot;, written and directed by Adam McKay, Bale underwent a major body transformation once again, as he gained over and shaved his head to portray US Vice President Dick Cheney. He described Cheney, who is reckoned the most influential and loathed vice president in US history, as &quot;quiet and secretive&quot;. The film reunited Bale with Amy Adams, with whom he had co-starred in &quot;The Fighter&quot; and &quot;American Hustle&quot;. It received positive reviews, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw commended Bale&#x27;s &quot;terrifically and in fact rather scarily plausible&quot; Cheney impersonation. Lauded by critics, the performance won Bale the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and garnered him an Academy Award nomination. During his acceptance speech at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, Bale thanked Satan for inspiring his Cheney portrayal, which elicited a response from Cheney&#x27;s daughter and US Representative Liz Cheney, who stated that Bale ruined his opportunity to play &quot;a real superhero&quot;.

Bale portrayed sports car racing driver Ken Miles in the 2019 sports drama &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, for which he lost after playing Cheney. Directed by James Mangold, the film follows Miles and automotive designer Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon, in events surrounding the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The role earned Bale a fifth Golden Globe Award nomination. While promoting the film, he said he would no longer go through weight fluctuations for roles.

===Limited work (2020–present)===
Bale played Gorr the God Butcher, a villain, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;&quot;, which was released in July 2022. He cited a character in the music video for the Aphex Twin song &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; as an inspiration for his characterisation of Gorr. Bale&#x27;s portrayal drew praise from critics, who deemed it &quot;grounded and non-campy&quot;. He produced and appeared in David O. Russell&#x27;s period film &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and Scott Cooper&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Pale Blue Eye&quot;, reuniting with both directors for the third time. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was released in October 2022, receiving dire reviews and failing at the box office. &quot;The Pale Blue Eye&quot;, adapted from the novel of the same name by Louis Bayard, was released in December 2022, receiving mixed reviews from critics. With his involvement in the 2023 Japanese animated film &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot;, Bale voiced a character in an English-language dub of a film by Hayao Miyazaki for the second time.

Bale will next play Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in Maggie Gyllenhaal&#x27;s fantasy period film &quot;The Bride!&quot;. It is scheduled for release in 2025.
==Artistry and public image==
Bale is known for his exhaustive dedication to the weight fluctuations that his parts demand as well as &quot;the intensity with which he completely inhabits his roles&quot;, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Ann Hornaday rating him among the most physically gifted actors of his generation. Max O&#x27;Connell of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; deemed Bale&#x27;s commitment to altering his physical appearance &quot;an anchoring facet to a depiction of obsession&quot; in his performances, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Hugh Hart likened the urgency that drives Bale&#x27;s acting style to method acting, adding that it &quot;convincingly animates even his most extreme physical transformations.&quot; Bale has said that he does not practise method acting and that he does not use a particular technique. He named Rowan Atkinson as his template as an actor and added that he was mesmerised by him when they worked together. He also studied the work of Gary Oldman, crediting him as the reason for his pursuit of acting.

Bale has been recognised for his versatility; Martha Ross of &quot;The Mercury News&quot; named him one of his generation&#x27;s most versatile actors. Known to be very private about his personal life, Bale has said that his objective was to embody characters without showing any aspect of himself. He explained that &quot;letting people know who you are&quot; does not help create different characters, viewing anonymity as &quot;what&#x27;s giving you the ability to play those characters&quot;. During interviews to promote films in which he puts on an accent, Bale would continue speaking in the given accent. Bale has also been noted for portraying roles with an American accent, with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Joe Reid listing him among those who &quot;work least in their native accents&quot;; in real life, Bale speaks in an &quot;emphatic, non-posh&quot; English accent.

Bale was ranked at number eight on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the highest-paid actors of 2014, earning $35 million. He has been described as a sex symbol.

==Personal life==

Bale has lived in Los Angeles since the 1990s. He holds US citizenship. Bale married Sandra &quot;Sibi&quot; Blažić, a former American model of Serbian descent, in Las Vegas on 29 January 2000. They have a daughter and a son. In 2000, Bale became feminist Gloria Steinem&#x27;s stepson following her marriage to his father, who died in 2003 of brain lymphoma.

Bale became a vegetarian at seven years old but in 2009 said he was &quot;in and out of the vegetarianism now&quot;. He had stopped eating red meat after reading the children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. An animal rights activist, he supports the organisations Greenpeace, the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Doris Day Animal League, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and Redwings Horse Sanctuary. While promoting &quot;The Flowers of War&quot; in December 2011, Bale, with a crew from the television network CNN, attempted to visit Chen Guangcheng, a confined blind barefoot lawyer, in a village in eastern China. He was forced to retreat after scuffling with guards at a checkpoint. Bale finally met Chen at a dinner held by the nonprofit Human Rights First the following year, during which he presented Chen with an award. Bale voiced Chen&#x27;s story in Amnesty International&#x27;s podcast, &quot;In Their Own Words&quot;. He co-founded California Together, an organisation aiming to construct a village in Palmdale, California to help siblings in foster care remain together.

On 22 July 2008, Bale was arrested in London after his mother and his sister Sharon reported him to the police for an alleged assault at a hotel. He was released on bail. Bale denied the allegations and later called the incident &quot;a deeply personal matter&quot;. On 14 August, the Crown Prosecution Service declared they would take no further action against him because of &quot;insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction&quot;.

==Acting credits and accolades==

According to the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which assigns films scores based on the number of positive critical reviews they receive, some of Bale&#x27;s highest-scoring films are &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; (2019), &quot;American Hustle&quot; (2013), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), &quot;The Fighter&quot; (2010), &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; (2007), &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (2007), &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015), &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012); the first, third and last of which are also listed by the data website The Numbers as his highest-grossing films, alongside &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), &quot;Thor: Love and Thunder&quot; (2022) and &quot;Exodus: Gods and Kings&quot; (2014).

Bale has garnered four Academy Award nominations, including two in the Best Actor category for his work in &quot;American Hustle&quot; and &quot;Vice&quot; (2018) as well as two in the Best Supporting Actor category for his work in &quot;The Fighter&quot; and &quot;The Big Short&quot;; he won one for &quot;The Fighter&quot;. He has earned two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his role in &quot;The Fighter&quot; and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in &quot;Vice&quot;, and received two nominations for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performances in &quot;American Hustle&quot; and &quot;The Big Short&quot; and a nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his performance in &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;. Bale has also been nominated for eight Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning in the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role category for &quot;The Fighter&quot; and the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture category as part of the &quot;American Hustle&quot; cast.

<text>The Archibald Fountain, properly called the J. F. Archibald Memorial Fountain, is located in Hyde Park, in central Sydney. It is named after J. F. Archibald, owner and editor of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine, who bequeathed funds to have it built. Archibald specified that it must be designed by a French artist, both because of his great love of French culture and to commemorate the association of Australia and France in World War I. He wished Sydney to aspire to Parisian civic design and ornamentation. The artist chosen was François-Léon Sicard, who completed it in Paris in 1926 but never saw the sculpture be placed in Sydney, where it was unveiled on 14 March 1932 by the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Samuel Walder.

==Description==
Sicard was one of the foremost sculptors of his day, a classically educated artist, whose inspiration was derived, at least in part, from his study of classical Greek and Roman art and literature. In submitting his proposal for the design of the sculptural groups, Sicard wrote: &quot;Apollo represents the Arts (Beauty and Light). Apollo holds out his right arm as a sign of protection, and spreads his benefits over all Nature, whilst he holds the Lyre in his left hand. Apollo is the warmth which vivifies, giving life to all Nature. At the touch of his rays, men awake, trees and fields become green, the animals go out into the fields, and men go to work at dawn.

&quot;The ancient Pliny adored the sun, symbol of Life. It is on this account that I wished this figure to be the chief one in the memorial.&quot;

An inscription on the fountain continues: &quot;At Apollo&#x27;s feet the Star of Day is indicated by a semi-circle of which the rays spread out in jets of light (the rising sun). The horse&#x27;s heads represent the horses of Apollo&#x27;s chariot. Out of the nostrils, water falls into the first basin, to fall there into the second and run away into the large basin.

&quot;The large basin is decorated with six tortoises which throw jets of water. The large basin is divided into three groups; one represents Diana, goddess of purity, of peaceful nights, symbol of charity: the ideal which watches over mortals-all that stands for poetry and harmony. The Pan group symbolises the good things of the earth – it is the &#x27;Young God of the fields and pastures and of the countryside&#x27;. The third group represents sacrifice for the public good. Theseus vanquisher of the Minotaur. The spirit triumphs over bestiality. Theseus delivers his country from the ransom which it had to pay to this monster. It is the sacrifice of himself for the good of humanity. Between these groups dolphins throw jets of water.&quot; The fountain is electrically illuminated and floodlit at night.

Sicard quotes Pliny as one of the ancient Roman sources for the modern understanding of the qualities supposedly represented by the gods. Rather than merely using the visual examples of works such as those by Pheidias, the iconic sculptor of classical Athens, whose free standing and frieze statuary represent the acme of the classical depiction of the human form in larger-than life bronze or marble, Sicard used literary sources to explain the symbology behind the form.

His choice of classical figures was in keeping with the European tradition of the sculpture and architecture of the precinct of Hyde Park. There is no indication in the writings of Sicard, or indeed, in the appraisal of his work, that there was any intention to link the figures in the sculptural groups with any religious or sexual themes.

==Conservation==
In 2013 the fountain underwent conservation work including &quot;the careful cleaning of all the elements, the waxing of the bronze figures and the repointing of the granite base and surround.&quot;

==Popular culture==

The popularity of the Archibald Fountain has been attributed to &quot;the interplay of water and sculpture, and also little elements that kids like.&quot; Over the years it has also been a chosen spot for photos, buskers, political rallies and just as a meeting place. The fountain is in an open space surrounded by formal flower gardens and has park benches provided nearby that make it a popular location for city workers at lunchtime. 

The Archibald Fountain is also known as one of the most homoerotic examples of public art in Australia. For the gay community, from around World War II up until the 1950s, the fountain was a &#x27;beat&#x27;. Indeed it was a meeting place for men who wanted to pick up other men for casual and consensual lovemaking. The Australian author, Kylie Tennant also features the Archibald Fountain in her 1967 novel: &quot;Tell Morning This&quot;, where she acknowledges it as a homosexual rendezvous.

<text>In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a market or fair and therefore became a &quot;market town&quot;. In Scotland, the equivalent is known as a burgh. There are two types of burgh: royal burghs and burghs of barony.

The Local Government Act 1972 allows civil parishes in England and Wales to resolve themselves to be Town Councils, under section (245 subsection 6), which also gives the chairman of such parishes the title &#x27;town mayor&#x27;. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs have such a status, along with other settlements with no prior town status.

In more modern times it is often considered that a town becomes a city (or a village becomes a town) as soon as it reaches a certain size or population, although this is an informal definition and no particular numbers are agreed upon.

The cultural importance placed on charters remains, and it is not an unusual event for towns across the UK to celebrate their charter in an annual Charter Day (normally a fair or medieval market).

<text>A live CD (also live DVD, live disc, or live operating system) is a complete bootable computer installation including operating system which runs directly from a CD-ROM or similar storage device into a computer&#x27;s memory, rather than loading from a hard disk drive. A live CD allows users to run an operating system for any purpose without installing it or making any changes to the computer&#x27;s configuration. Live CDs can run on a computer without secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive, or with a corrupted hard disk drive or file system, allowing data recovery.

As CD and DVD drives have been steadily phased-out, live CDs have become less popular, being replaced by live USBs, which are equivalent systems written onto USB flash drives, which have the added benefit of having writeable storage. The functionality of a live CD is also available with an external hard disk drive connected by USB. Many live CDs offer the option of persistence by writing files to a hard drive or USB flash drive.

Many Linux distributions make ISO images available for burning to CD or DVD. While open source operating systems can be used for free, some commercial software, such as Windows To Go requires a license to use. Many live CDs are used for data recovery, computer forensics, disk imaging, system recovery and malware removal. The Tails operating system is aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity of its users, allowing them to work with sensitive documents without leaving a record on a computer&#x27;s hard drive.

== History ==
All computers except the earliest digital computers are built with some form of minimal built-in loader, which loads a program or succession of programs from a storage medium, which then operate the computer. Initially a read-only medium such as punched tape or punched cards was used for initial program load. With the introduction of inexpensive read-write storage, read-write floppy disks and hard disks were used as boot media.

After the introduction of the audio compact disc, it was adapted for use as a medium for storing and distributing large amounts of computer data. This data may also include application and operating-system software, sometimes packaged and archived in compressed formats. Later, it was seen to be convenient and useful to boot the computer directly from compact disc, often with a minimal working system to install a full system onto a hard drive. While there are read-write optical discs, either mass-produced read-only discs or write-once discs were used for this purpose.

The first Compact Disc drives on personal computers were generally much too slow to run complex operating systems; computers were not designed to boot from an optical disc. When operating systems came to be distributed on compact discs, either a boot floppy or the CD itself would boot specifically, and only, to install onto a hard drive. Early examples of operating systems which could be booted directly from CD-ROM are the FM Towns OS, and the Desktop-VMS distribution of VMS, both of which were first released in 1989.

=== Linux ===
Although early developers and users of distributions built on top of the Linux kernel could take advantage of cheap optical disks and rapidly declining prices of CD drives for personal computers, the Linux distribution CDs or &quot;distros&quot; were generally treated as a collection of installation packages that would first need to be permanently installed to hard disks on the target machine.

However, in the case of these distributions built on top of the Linux kernel, the free operating system was meeting resistance in the consumer market because of the perceived difficulty, effort, and risk involved in installing an additional partition on the hard disk, in parallel with an existing operating system installation.

The term &quot;live CD&quot; was coined because, after typical PC RAM was large enough and 52x speed CD drives and CD burners were widespread among PC owners, it finally became convenient and practical to boot the kernel and run X11, a window manager and GUI applications directly from a CD without disturbing the OS on the hard disk.

This was a new and different situation for Linux than other operating systems, because the updates/upgrades were being released so quickly, different distributions and versions were being offered online, and especially because users were burning their own CDs.

The first Linux-based &#x27;Live CD&#x27; was Yggdrasil Linux first released in beta form 1992~1993 (ceased production in 1995), though in practice its functionality was hampered due to the low throughput of contemporary CD-ROM drives. DemoLinux, released in 1998, was the first Linux distribution specially designed as a live CD. The Linuxcare bootable business card, first released in 1999, was the first Live CD to focus on system administration, and the first to be distributed in the bootable business card form factor. , Finnix (first released in spring 2000) is the oldest Live CD still in production. Shortly followed by Knoppix, a Debian-derived Linux distribution, also still produced, it first released in fall 2000 and found popularity as both a rescue disk system and as a primary distribution in its own right.

Since 2003, the popularity of live CDs has increased substantially, partly due to Linux Live scripts and remastersys, which made it very easy to build customized live systems. Most of the popular Linux distributions now include a live CD variant, which in some cases is also the preferred installation medium.

== Uses ==

Live CDs are made for many different uses. Some are designed to demonstrate or &quot;test drive&quot; a particular operating system (usually Linux or another free or open source operating system). Software can be tested, or run for a particular single use, without interfering with system setup. Data on a system which is not functioning normally due to operating system and software issues can be made available; for example, data can be recovered from a machine with an active virus infection without the virus process being active and causing more damage, and the virus can be removed with its defences against removal bypassed.

Although some live CDs can load into memory to free the optical drive for other uses, loading the data from a CD-ROM is still slower than a typical hard drive boot, so this is rarely the default with large live CD images, but for smaller live CD images loading the filesystem directly into RAM can provide a significant performance boost, as RAM is much faster than a hard drive, and uses less power. Experienced users of the operating system may also use a live CD to determine whether and to what extent a particular operating system or version is compatible with a particular hardware configuration and certain peripherals, or as a way to know beforehand which computer or peripheral will work before buying. A live CD can be used to troubleshoot hardware, especially when a hard drive fails, and more generally as a recovery disc in case of problems. Some live CDs can save user-created files in a Windows partition, a USB drive, a network drive, or other accessible media. Live backup CDs can create an image of drives, and back up files, without problems due to open files and inconsistent sets.

A few additional uses include:
* installing a Linux distribution to a hard drive
* computer forensics
* Virus scanning and Malware removal
* system repair and restoration
* testing new versions of software
* listing &amp; testing hardware
* Internet kiosks and public computers, which can be brought back to their original state by a reboot
* high security/non-invasive environment for a guest
* cracking, stealing, and changing passwords
* network security testing
* being the primary or backup operating system for any computer
* quick and simple clustering of computers
* playing video games or running applications that require a different operating system
* providing a secure server platform where crucial files cannot be permanently altered
* providing a secure, reliable platform for the performance of high-vulnerability tasks such as internet banking;
* Bypassing parental controls and other restrictions

Several live CDs are dedicated to specific type of applications according to the requirements of thematic user communities. These CDs are tailored to the needs of the applications in subject including general knowledge, tutorial, specifications and trial data too.

Some of these topics covers sub topics, e.g. IT administration breaks down to firewall, rescue, security, etc. type of live CDs. In some cases a particular Live DVD covers more than one topic.

=== Software appliances ===

Packaging a software appliance as an installable live CD, or live ISO, can often be beneficial as a single image can run on both real hardware and on most types of virtual machines.

This allows developers to avoid the complexities involved in supporting multiple incompatible virtual machine images formats and
focus on the lowest common denominator instead.

Typically after booting the machine from the live CD, the appliance either runs in non-persistent demo mode or installs itself, at the user&#x27;s request, to an available storage device.

=== Mounting without burning ===
The files on a live CD ISO image can be accessed in Microsoft Windows with a disk image emulator such as Daemon Tools, or in Unix variants by mounting a loop device. Later versions of Windows (i.e. Windows 8 and later), and software available for earlier versions, allow an ISO to be mounted as a volume.

After mounting the live CD&#x27;s filesystem, software on the live CD can be run directly, without booting it, by chrooting into the mounted filesystem.

A live CD ISO image can also be mounted by Virtual Machine software such as VirtualBox and VMware Workstation or can be converted to a Live USB using SYSLINUX. Special tools can automate this process.

== Features ==
During live CD initialization, a user typically may resort to using one or more boot codes to change the booting behavior. These vary from distribution to distribution but can most often be accessed upon first boot screen by one of the function keys.

Some live CDs come with an installation utility launchable from a desktop icon that can optionally install the system on a hard drive or USB flash drive. Most live CDs can access the information on internal and/or external hard drives, diskettes and USB flash drives.

Live CDs are usually distributed on read-only media, requiring either copying to rewriteable media (i.e. a hard drive or CD writer) or complete remastering to install additional software; however, there are exceptions. If Puppy Linux is recorded to an open multisession medium, changes made during use (such as files created, programs installed, and preferences customised) are written in a new session to the boot medium persisting through subsequent boots.

The term &quot;Live CD&quot; came to be used for any CD containing operating system and software which could be run without installation on the host computer. Operating systems which can be used live include AmigaOS 4, Amithlon, AROS, FreeBSD, FreeDOS, classic Mac OS, macOS, Microsoft Windows installation and repair discs, OS/2, ReactOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MINIX 3, Plan 9 from Bell Labs, MorphOS, OpenSolaris, BeleniX and others based on Solaris. There are maintenance versions of Microsoft Windows bootable from CD such as BartPE, Windows PE, and Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT), previously known as Emergency Repair Disk Commander (ERD Commander).

The first personal computer operating system on a CD to support &quot;live&quot; operations might have been the AmigaOS, which could be booted from CD on an Amiga CDTV in 1990.. Earlier examples of live OS are of course the operating systems used from floppy, and most widely spread is DOS.

Unlike previous operating systems on optical media, though, Linux and OS/2 &quot;live CDs&quot; were specifically designed to run without installation onto other media like a hard disk drive. The live CD concept was meant to promote Linux and showcase the abilities of the free, open source operating system on conventional personal computers with Microsoft Windows already installed. 

On a PC, a bootable Compact Disc generally conforms to the El Torito specification, introduced in 1994. Many Linux based live CDs use a compressed filesystem image, often with the cloop compressed loopback driver, or squashfs compressed filesystem, generally doubling effective storage capacity, although slowing application start up.

The resulting environment can be quite rich: typical Knoppix systems include around 1,200 separate software packages. Live CDs have a reputation for supporting advanced auto-configuration and plug-and-play functionality. This came out of necessity to avoid requiring the user to configure the system each time it boots and to make it easily usable by those who are new to the operating system.

== Creation ==
A read-only file system, such as on a CD-ROM has the drawback of being unable to save any current working data. For this reason, a read-only file system is often merged with a temporary writable file system in the form of a RAM disk. Often the default Linux directories &quot;codice_1&quot; (containing users&#x27; personal files and configuration files) and &quot;codice_2&quot; (containing variable data) are kept in ramdisk, because the system updates them frequently. Puppy Linux and some other live CDs allow a configuration and added files to be written and used in later sessions.

In modern live CDs, a read-only file system is merged with a RAM drive using transparent techniques such as UnionFS, AuFS or EWF. Boot loaders like syslinux can boot ISO files from USB memory devices.

Live CDs have to be able to detect and use a wide variety of hardware (including network cards, graphic cards etc.) in realtime, often using facilities such as udev, hotplug, hal, udisk etc.. which are a common part of all distributions based on Linux kernel 2.6.

<text>Neoplasticism (or neo-plasticism), originating from the Dutch , is an avant-garde art theory proposed by Piet Mondrian in 1917 and initially employed by the De Stijl art movement. The most notable proponents of this theory were Mondrian and another Dutch artist, Theo van Doesburg. Neoplasticism advocated for a purified abstract art, by applying a set of elementary art principles. Thus, a painting that adhered to neoplastic art theory would typically consist of a balanced composition of simple geometric shapes, right-angled relationships and primary colors.

==Terminology ==
Mondrian, Van der Leck and Van Doesburg first set out the philosophical basis for the art theory known originally as , but known today as &quot;Neoplasticism&quot;, in a new art journal named &quot;De Stijl&quot; [&quot;The Style&quot;]. The term appears in an editorial by Van Doesburg in the first issue of the journal and in the first of a series of articles by Mondrian entitled . The expression &quot;&quot; is believed to derive from the work of Mathieu Schoenmaekers, who used the term in his 1915 book ,; copies of books by Schoenmaekers were found in Mondrian&#x27;s library.

Introducing their translation of Mondrian&#x27;s publications, Holtzman and James wrote: 
Some authors have translated as &quot;new art&quot;.

The term [neo-plasticism] first appeared in Mondrian&#x27;s , [Neo-plasticism: the general principle of plastic equivalence]. Mondrian described the essay as a &quot;condensed adaptation of the ideas in his Trialogue&quot;. The book was translated into French with the help of Mondrian&#x27;s old friend, Dr Rinus Ritsema van Eck. In the 1925 German edition – the fifth in the Bauhaus series (translated by Rudolf F. Hartogh) – the term is translated as [New Design].

Between 1935 and 1936, Mondrian wrote an essay in French, translated into English with the help of Winifred Nicholson and published in the book &quot;Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art&quot; as &quot;Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art (Figurative Art and Non-Figurative Art)&quot;. After moving to the United States, Mondrian wrote several articles in English with the help of Harry Holtzman and Charmion von Wiegand, in which he maintained the use of the term &#x27;plastic&#x27;.

In his book &quot;De Stijl&quot;, Paul Overy reflects on the confusing terminology for English readers: 
Notwithstanding this critique, Victoria George provides a succinct explanation of Mondrian&#x27;s terminology: 
==Neoplastic theory==
According to neoplastic principles, every work of art (painting, sculpture, building, piece of music, book, etc.,) is created intentionally. It is the product of a series of aesthetic choices and, to a lesser extent, of what the work of art represents. For example, the event depicted in the painting &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;, by Nicolas Poussin, never took place. Even though the postures of the figures are unnatural, it is convincing and forms a harmonious whole.

Every artist manipulates reality to produce an aesthetically and artistically pleasing harmony. The most realistic painters, such as Johannes Vermeer or Rembrandt van Rijn, use all kinds of artistic means to achieve the greatest possible degree of harmony.

The artists of &quot;De Stijl&quot; called these &#x27;visual means&#x27; &quot;&quot; (&quot;plastic&quot;). However, the artist determines to what extent he allows these &#x27;plastic means&#x27; to dominate or whether he remains as close as possible to his subject. There is therefore a duality in painting and sculptureand to a lesser extent in architecture, music and literaturebetween the &quot;idea&quot; of the artist and the &quot;matter&quot; of the world around us.

The Dutch neo-plasticists, imbued with Calvinism and Theosophy, preferred the universal over the individual, the spiritual over the natural, the abstract over the real, the non-figurative over the figurative, the intuitive over the rational; all of which were summarised by Mondrian as the superiority of pure plastic over the plastic. The neo-plasticists of &quot;De Stijl&quot; expressed their vision (plastic) in terms of &#x27;pure&#x27; elements, not found in nature: straight lines, right angles, primary colours and precise relationships. This disassociation from nature created a new art, whose essential qualities were spiritual, entirely abstract, and rational.

===Idea versus Matter===

In his &quot;Principles of Neo-Plastic Art&quot;, Van Doesburg distinguishes between two types of visual art in art history: works that arise from an internal &quot;idea&quot; (ideo-plastic art), and works that arise from external &quot;matter&quot; (physio-plastic art). He demonstrates this with an abstract model of the Egyptian god Horus and a realistic statue of a Diadumenos respectively. When an artist experiences reality, his aesthetic experience can be expressed as either a material depiction, or an abstract formation. Van Doesburg regards depiction as an &#x27;indirect&#x27; form of artistic expression; only abstract formation based on an artist&#x27;s true aesthetic experience of reality represents a pure form of artistic expression, as expressed by Mondrian in all his essays.

=== Visual resources ===

According to the new visual art, every work of art consists of a number of basic elements, which they called &#x27;visual means&#x27;. According to the artists of De Stijl, these &#x27;visual means&#x27;, unlike representation, are entirely inherent to art. If one wanted to produce a work of art &#x27;according to art&#x27;, one had to use only these basic elements. Mondrian wrote:
While Mondrian limited himself to painting, Van Doesburg believed in the collaboration of all arts to achieve a new Gesamtkunstwerk [total work of art]. To achieve this, it was necessary for each art form to establish its own &#x27;visual means&#x27;. Only then was the independence of each art form guaranteed. In 1920 he arrived at the following definition:
=== Synthesis ===

The artists of De Stijl strove for more and better cooperation between the arts without each art form losing its independence. The reason for this was what they saw as the architect&#x27;s role being too great. The greatest results were expected from the collaboration between the architect and the painter. It was then the painter&#x27;s task to &#x27;recapture&#x27; the flat surface of architecture. Van Doesburg wrote about this:
In 1923, following the De Stijl architectural exhibition in Paris, Van Doesburg also involved the &#x27;unenclosed (= open) space relationship&#x27; of furniture art on architecture. He subsequently regarded architecture as a &#x27;synthesis of new visual expression&#x27;. &#x27;In the new architecture, architecture is understood as a part, the summary of all the arts, in its most elementary appearance, as its essence&#x27;, according to Van Doesburg.

== Background ==
=== Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian ===
Although countless artists embraced and applied the ideas of neoplasticism during the interwar period, its origins can mainly be attributed to Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian. They have worked to publicize their ideas through a stream of publications, exhibitions and lectures. Moreover, from 1917 to 1924 they were the constant factors in the otherwise quite turbulent history of the Style Movement. Their views on art were so close that some works by Van Doesburg and Mondrian are almost completely interchangeable. Van Doesburg&#x27;s widow, Nelly van Doesburg, commented: &quot;I also remember that Mondrian and Does once jointly created a painting with the explicit intention that all traces of individual contribution would be removed. However, this does not mean that both men did not possess a strongly developed personal character. In fact, each had a completely individual temperament, and one can feel that the reason for their friendship lay in the so-called law that &#x27;opposites attract.&#x27;&quot;.

However, differences of opinion appeared between the two as early as 1919, and in 1922 there was a rift in their relationship over the application of neo-plastic principles to architecture, and Van Doesburg&#x27;s integration of the element of time into Mondrian&#x27;s neo-plastic theory. 

=== Theosophy ===
When Van Doesburg and Mondrian first made public their ideas about the New Plastic art, both painters were influenced by theosophy. Mondrian wrote the first theoretical treatise in his then hometown Laren, North Holland. Here he met the theosophist-author Mathieu Schoenmaekers. Mondrian adopted some of Schoenmaekers&#x27; terminology, including the Dutch term . Van Doesburg and Mondrian&#x27;s ideas about the spiritual come from Kandinsky&#x27;s autobiography [On the spiritual in art] published in 1911. Mondrian remained interested in theosophy until his death. Van Doesburg distanced himself from theosophy around 1920 and focused on quasi-scientific theories such as the fourth dimension and what he called &#x27;mechanical aesthetics&#x27; (design by mechanical means). However, he continued to use the term &#x27;spiritual&#x27; in his articles.

=== Philosophy ===
Although Van Doesburg was influenced by Theosophy, his writings were more in the Hegelian philosophical tradition. Unlike Mondrian, Van Doesburg was better informed of the latest developments in theory and adopted many ideas from other theorists, including Wilhelm Worringer. But although Worringer regarded abstraction as the opposite of naturalism, according to Van Doesburg, art history as a whole developed towards abstraction. Van Doesburg borrowed the idea that art and architecture was composed of separate elements from Wölfflins &quot;Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe&quot; from 1915. In his lecture &quot;Klassiek-Barok-Modern&quot; &quot;[Classical-Baroque-Modern]&quot; (1918), Van Doesburg elaborated on Wölfflin&#x27;s concept of the contrast between the classical and the baroque, using Hegel&#x27;s idea of thesis, antithesis and synthesis, where the &quot;classical&quot; is the thesis, &quot;baroque&quot; is the antithesis, and &quot;modern&quot; is the synthesis. 

=== Evolutionary thinking ===

Van Doesburg developed the theory of neoplasticism to include an evolutionary and therefore temporal element. From 1919 onwards, through lectures and publications, Van Doesburg worked to demonstrate that art slowly developed as a means of expression from the natural to a means of expression of the spiritual. According to him, the spiritual and the natural in art were not always in balance in the past and neoplasticism would restore this balance. The diagram reproduced here, which Van Doesburg probably drew up as a result of the lectures he gave in Jena, Weimar and Berlin in 1921, clearly indicates the extent to which Van Doesburg thought how nature and spirit were related in the various Western European cultural periods. He begins on the far right with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, where nature and spirit were still in balance. The ancient Romans focused on the natural, while in the Middle Ages the spiritual predominated. In the Renaissance, art again turned towards the natural, only to be surpassed by the Baroque. The Biedermeier and the &quot;Idealism and Reform&quot; in the nineteenth century restored the balance somewhat, ending in the time of Neoplasticism (), in which the polarity between the natural and spiritual was completely abolished. However, Van Doesburg did not see &quot;his&quot; version of neoplasticism as an ideal final stage or as a utopia. As he states in the same lecture: &quot;&quot;Never, anywhere is there an ending. The process is unceasing&quot;.&quot;

===Fourth dimension===
A number of contributors to &quot;De Stijl&quot; mention the fourth dimension several times in passing – for example Gino Severini in his article entitled . Passages like these also occur in other avant-garde movements but seldom lead to concrete results. Theo van Doesburg had an interest in the fourth dimension (motion) from 1918, eventually finding expression in Elementarism, most prominently seen in his architectural interior designs, such as the Aubette in Strasbourg.

==Neoplasticism in painting==

Neoplasticism assumes that when the painter tries to shape reality (or truth), he never does this from what he sees (object, matter, the physical), but from what originates within himself (subject, idea, the spiritual), or as Georges Vantongerloo puts it: &quot;&#x27;&quot; [&quot;The highest truth, or the absolute truth, is imagined through the invisible&quot;]. Mondrian calls this process &#x27;internalization&#x27;. In addition, no painting is created by chance. Each painting is an interplay of space, plane, line and color. These are the &quot;plastic (visual)&quot; means in painting. If the artist wants to approach the truth as closely as possible, he dissolves the natural form into these most elementary visual means. In this way the painter achieves universal harmony. The role of the artist (the individual or the subjective) is limited to determining the relationship between these visual means (the composition). The artist thus becomes a mediator between the spectator and the absolute (the objective). Following Schoenmaekers – who associated the physical with the horizontal, and the spiritual with the vertical – the neo-plastic painters applied horizontal and vertical lines with rectangular areas of color in order to radically simplify painting, purifying art of those elements that are not directly related to expressing &quot;pure reality&quot;.

== Neoplasticism in sculpture ==
According to Van Doesburg, the sculptor is concerned with &#x27;volume ratio&#x27;. He applied a similar principle to architecture, concluding that the sculptor is concerned with &#x27;volume ratio&#x27; and the architect with &#x27;ratio of enclosed spaces&#x27;. In his 1925 book &quot;Grundbegriffe der neuen gestaltenden Kunst&quot;, Van Doesburg distinguished two elements for sculpture: a positive element (volume) and a negative element (void).

==Neoplasticism in architecture==

Architecture, unlike painting, has less &#x27;burden&#x27; of meaning. Architectural beauty, according to Van Doesburg, is mainly determined by mass ratio, rhythm and tension between the vertical and horizontal (to name just a few visual means in architecture). Many of these ideas come from the German architect Gottfried Semper, for example the great emphasis on walls as a plane and as a divider of space and the principle of &#x27;unity in the multiplicity&#x27; (the realisation that buildings, furniture, sculptures and paintings can be seen not only as units, but also as assemblages of separate elements). Semper&#x27;s ideas were spread in the Netherlands by Berlage, the spiritual father of modern architecture in the Netherlands. It was also Berlage who, after a visit to the United States in 1911, introduced the Netherlands to the work of the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright&#x27;s ideas found favour with the architects of De Stijl, not least because of &#x27;his mystical contrast between the horizontal and vertical, the external and internal, nature and culture&#x27;.

The architect J. J. P. Oud talks about the primary means of representation and, like Van Doesburg, sees a strong similarity with modern painting in that respect. According to Oud, the secondary visual means, decoration, do not contribute to a harmonious architecture. Moreover, he is of the opinion that material must be used in a pure manner (reinforced concrete as reinforced concrete, brick as brick, wood as wood) and that the architect should not be guilty of seeking effect. Restrictions were also imposed in architecture, so that a symbolic or decorative application of the visual means was virtually impossible.

Van Doesburg&#x27;s first definition of architecture comes from his series of articles &quot;The new movement in painting&quot; from 1916, in which he writes that &quot;for the architect, space is the first conditions for composition&quot; and that the architect &quot;breaks up space through size proportions realized in stone&quot;. He added two elements to this starting point in 1925: an active element (mass) and a passive element (space). He then divides the visual media of architecture into positive elements (line, plane, volume, space and time) and negative elements (void and material). By 1923, the inclusion of volume and time as elements of neoplasticism caused serious rifts between Mondrian and Oud, and later with Van Doesburg, who went on the evolve the philosophy of De Stijl to Elementarism.

== Neoplasticism in film ==
In 1920, Van Doesburg met the filmmakers Hans Richter and Viking Eggeling. They worked on short, abstract films, based on the relationship of shapes, and the development of shapes over time. After this he made films that consisted of moving compositions with squares and rectangles, which were in line with the principles of neoplasticism. In 1923, Van Doesburg wrote that film should not be seen as a two-dimensional art form, but has its own visual means: light, movement and space.

== Neoplasticism in poetry ==

According to Van Doesburg, poetry, just like painting, was also &#x27;visual&#x27;. According to him, poetry is not only about the meaning of the word, but also about the sound. Just as in painting, Van Doesburg strove for a poetry that was not narrative. The New Visual poet used the word directly, without associations with the world around us. This resulted in a series of sound poem and typographical poems. Through typography he created sonority and rhythm, which draws the reader&#x27;s attention to a particular word. Van Doesburg also published so-called &quot;Letter-sound-images&quot; under the pseudonym I.K. Bonset; poems that consist only of letters.

==Neoplasticism in music==
The De Stijl artists also strove for a balanced portrayal of proportion in music. Just as these were determined in painting by size, color and non-color, neo-plastic music is determined by size, tone and non-tone. Mondrian was of the opinion that music, like painting, should be purified of natural influences by, among other things, tightening the rhythm. The non-tone replaces the old rest, but to be &#x27;visual&#x27; it must consist of sound; Mondrian suggests using noise for this. Just as in painting, tone and non-tone follow each other directly. This creates a &#x27;flat, pure, sharply defined&#x27; music.

== Neoplasticism in philosophy ==
The supporters of the new visual art thought that if neoplasticism was consistently implemented, art would cease to exist. The composer Jacob van Domselaer wrote: &quot;Later there will be no need for art; then all images, all sounds will be superfluous!&quot;.
Theo van Doesburg saw neoplasticism as a total vision, which he summarized in an article in &quot;De Stijl&quot; entitled &quot;&quot; [The new worldview]:

<doc id="331144" wikidata="Q15146576" url="?curid=331144" title="Palatine tonsil">
<text>Palatine tonsils, commonly called the tonsils and occasionally called the faucial tonsils, are tonsils located on the left and right sides at the back of the throat in humans and other mammals, which can often be seen as flesh-colored, pinkish lumps. Tonsils only present as &quot;white lumps&quot; if they are inflamed or infected with symptoms of exudates (pus drainage) and severe swelling.

Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils and will often, but not necessarily, cause a sore throat and fever. In chronic cases, tonsillectomy may be indicated.

==Structure==

The palatine tonsils are located in the isthmus of the fauces, between the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch of the soft palate.

The palatine tonsil is one of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), located at the entrance to the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts to protect the body from the entry of exogenous material through mucosal sites. In consequence it is a site of, and potential focus for, infections, and is one of the chief immunocompetent tissues in the oropharynx. It forms part of the Waldeyer&#x27;s ring, which comprises the adenoid, the paired tubal tonsils, the paired palatine tonsils and the lingual tonsils. From the pharyngeal side, they are covered with a stratified squamous epithelium, whereas a fibrous capsule links them to the wall of the pharynx. Through the capsule pass trabecules that contain small blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic vessels. These trabecules divide the tonsil into lobules.

===Blood supply and innervation===

The nerves supplying the palatine tonsils come from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve via the lesser palatine nerves, and from the tonsillar branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve continues past the palatine tonsil and innervates the posterior 1/3 of the tongue to provide general and taste sensation. This nerve is most likely to be damaged during a tonsillectomy, which leads to reduced or lost general sensation and taste sensation to the posterior third of the tongue.

Blood supply is provided by tonsillar branches of five arteries: the dorsal lingual artery (of the lingual artery), ascending palatine artery (of the facial artery), tonsillar branch (of the facial artery), ascending pharyngeal artery (of the external carotid artery), and the lesser palatine artery (a branch of the descending palatine artery, itself a branch of the maxillary artery).
The tonsils venous drainage is by the peritonsillar plexus, which drain into the lingual and pharyngeal veins, which in turn drain into the internal jugular vein.

===Tonsillar crypts===
Palatine tonsils consist of approximately 15 crypts, which result in a large internal surface. The tonsils contain four lymphoid compartments that influence immune functions, namely the reticular crypt epithelium, the extrafollicular area, the mantle zones of lymphoid follicles, and the follicular germinal centers. In human palatine tonsils, the very first part exposed to the outside environment is tonsillar epithelium.

==Function==

===Local immunity===
Tonsillar (relating to palatine tonsil) B cells can mature to produce all the five major immunoglobulin (Ig, aka antibody) classes. Furthermore, when incubated in vitro with either mitogens or specific antigens, they produce specific antibodies against diphtheria toxoid, poliovirus, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and the lipopolysaccharide of &quot;E. coli&quot;. Most Immunoglobulin A produced by tonsillar B cells in vitro appears to be 7S monomers, although a significant proportion may be l0S dimeric IgA.

In addition to humoral immunity elicited by tonsillar and adenoidal B cells following antigenic stimulation, there is considerable T-cell response in palatine tonsils. Thus, natural infection or intranasal immunization with live, attenuated rubella virus vaccine has been reported to prime tonsillar lymphocytes much better than subcutaneous vaccination. Also, natural infection with varicella zoster virus has been found to stimulate tonsillar lymphocytes better than lymphocytes from peripheral blood.

===Cytokine action===
Cytokines are humoral immunomodulatory proteins or glycoproteins which control or modulate the activities of target cells, resulting in gene activation, leading to mitotic division, growth and differentiation, migration, or apoptosis. They are produced by wide range of cell types upon antigen-specific and non-antigen specific stimuli. It has been reported by many studies that the clinic outcome of many infectious, autoimmune, or malignant diseases appears to be influenced by the overall balance of production (profiles) of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, determination of cytokine profiles in tonsil study will provide key information for further in-depth analysis of the cause and underlying mechanisms of these disorders, as well as the role and possible interactions between the T- and B-lymphocytes and other immunocompetent cells.

The cytokine network represents a very sophisticated and versatile regulatory system that is essential to the immune system for overcoming the various defense strategies of microorganisms. Through several studies, the Th1 and Th2 cytokines and cytokine mRNA are both detectable in tonsillar hypertrophy (or obstructive sleep apnea, OSA) and recurrent tonsillitis groups. It showed that human palatine tonsil is an active immunological organ containing a wide range of cytokine-producing cells. Both Th1 and Th2 cells are involved in the pathophysiology of TH and RT conditions. Indeed, human tonsils persistently harbor microbial antigens even when the subject is asymptomatic of ongoing infection. It could also be an effect of ontogeny of the immune system.

==Clinical significance==
The pathogenesis of infectious/inflammatory disease in the tonsils most likely has its basis in their anatomic location and their inherent function as organ of immunity, processing infectious material, and other antigens and then becoming, paradoxically, a focus of infection/inflammation. No single theory of pathogenesis has yet been accepted, however. Viral infection with secondary bacterial invasion may be one mechanism of the initiation of chronic disease, but the effects of the environment, host factors, the widespread use of antibiotics, ecological considerations, and diet all may play a role. A recent cross-sectional study revealed a high rate of prevalent virus infections in non-acutely ill patients undergoing routine tonsillectomy. However, none of the 27 detected viruses showed positive association to the tonsillar disease.

In children, the tonsils are common sites of infections that may give rise to acute or chronic tonsillitis. However, it is still an open question whether tonsillar hypertrophy is also caused by a persistent infection. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common major operations performed on children. The indications for the operation have been complicated by the controversy over the benefits of removing a chronically infected tissue and the possible harm caused by eliminating an important immune inductive tissue.

The information that is necessary to make a rational decision to resolve this controversy can be obtained by understanding the immunological potential of the normal palatine tonsils and comparing these functions with the changes that occur in the chronically diseased counterparts.

===Acute tonsillitis===

Tonsillitis is the inflammation of tonsils. Acute tonsillitis is the most common manifestation of tonsillar disease. It is associated with sore throat, fever and difficulty swallowing. The tonsils may appear normal sized or enlarged but are usually erythematous. Often, but not always, exudates can be seen. Not all these signs and symptoms are present in every patient.

===Recurrent tonsillitis===
Recurrent infection has been variably defined as from four to seven episodes of acute tonsillitis in one year, five episodes for two consecutive years or three episodes per year for 3 consecutive years.

===Tonsillar hypertrophy===
Tonsillar hypertrophy is the enlargement of the tonsils, but without the history of inflammation. Obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy is currently the most common reason for tonsillectomy. These patients present with varying degrees of disturbed sleep which may include symptoms of loud snoring, irregular breathing, nocturnal choking and coughing, frequent awakenings, sleep apnea, dysphagia and/or daytime hypersomnolence. These may lead to behavioral/mood changes in patients and facilitate the need for a polysomnography in order to determine the degree to which these symptoms are disrupting their sleep.

<doc id="331151" wikidata="Q170381" url="?curid=331151" title="Tonsillectomy">
<text>Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure in which both palatine tonsils are fully removed from the back of the throat. The procedure is mainly performed for recurrent tonsillitis, throat infections and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). For those with frequent throat infections, surgery results in 0.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 0.1) fewer sore throats in the following year, but there is no evidence of long term benefits. In children with OSA, it results in improved quality of life.
While generally safe, complications may include bleeding, vomiting, dehydration, trouble eating, and trouble talking. Throat pain typically lasts about one to two weeks after surgery. Bleeding occurs in about 1% within the first day and another 2% after that. Between 1 in 2,360 and 1 in 56,000 procedures cause death. Tonsillectomy does not appear to affect long term immune function.
Following the surgery, ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat postoperative pain. The surgery is often done using metal instruments or electrocautery. The adenoid may also be removed or shaved down, in which case it is known as an &quot;adenotonsillectomy&quot;. The partial removal of the tonsils is called a &quot;tonsillotomy&quot;, which may be preferred in cases of OSA.
The surgery has been described since at least as early as 50 AD by Celsus. In the United States, as of 2010, tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1970s although it remains the second-most common outpatient surgical procedure in children. The typical cost when done as an inpatient in the United States is US$4,400 as of 2013. There is some controversy as of 2019 as to when the surgery should be used. There are variations in the rates of tonsillectomy between and within countries.

==Medical uses==
Tonsillectomy is mainly undertaken for sleep apnea and recurrent or chronic tonsillitis. It is also carried out for peritonsillar abscess, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA), guttate psoriasis, nasal airway obstruction, tonsil cancer and diphtheria carrier state. For children, tonsillectomy is usually combined with the removal of the adenoid. However, it is unclear whether the removal of the adenoid has any additional positive or negative effects for the treatment of recurrent sore throat. In cases of chronic tonsillitis in adults, there is strong evidence of increased quality of life, reduction of symptoms, and economic benefit. A randomised controlled trial of tonsillectomy versus medical treatment (antibiotics and pain killers) in adults with frequent tonsillitis found that tonsillectomy was more effective and cost effective. It resulted in fewer days with sore throat.

===Sore throat===
Surgery is not recommended for those with fewer than seven documented throat infections in the last year, fewer than five each year for the last two years, or fewer than three each year for three years. Severely affected children who undergo surgery on average have one fewer sore throat per year in the subsequent one or two years, compared to those who do not. Specifically one review of five randomized controlled trials, found a decrease from 3.6 to 3.0 episodes in the year following surgery. In less severely affected children, surgery results in an increase, rather than a decrease of sore throats when the sore throat directly following surgery is included. Surgery results in a reduction in school absence in the following year, but the strength of evidence is low. Surgery does not result in an improvement in the quality of life. Benefits of surgery do not persist over time. Those with frequent throat infections often spontaneously improve over a year without surgery. Therefore, a certain number of people who undergo surgery will do so unnecessarily as they would not have had further episodes of tonsillitis had they not had surgery. Evidence in adults is unclear.

In 2019, the American Academy of Otolaryngology &amp; Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) recommended:Many cases of the sore throat have other causes than tonsillitis and tonsillectomy is therefore not indicated for those cases. The diagnosis of tonsillitis is often made without testing for bacteria. The UK National Health Service states that it is very rare that someone needs to have their tonsils taken out, and it is usually only necessary in case of severe tonsillitis that keeps recurring.

===Obstructive sleep apnea===
Tonsillectomy improves obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in most children. A 2015 Cochrane review found moderate quality evidence for benefits in terms of quality of life and symptoms but no benefit in attention or academic performance. It recommended that physicians and parents should weigh the benefits and risks of surgery as OSA symptoms may spontaneously resolve over time. An AHRQ review however did find improvements at school. The procedure is recommended for those who have OSA that has been verified by a sleep study. Studies have shown that treatment success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy increases with tonsil size.

===Other===
There is no good evidence for other uses such as tonsil stones, bad breath, trouble swallowing, and an abnormal voice in children.

==Complications==
While generally safe, tonsillectomy may result in several complications, some of which are serious. Complications are divided into primary (first 24 hours after surgery), and secondary (after 24 hours), with bleeding being the most common complication. Other common complications are postoperative nausea and vomiting, dehydration, trouble eating, ear pain, taste dysfunction and trouble talking. In rare cases, tonsillectomy may also cause damage to the teeth (because of the clamp that is placed in the mouth during surgery), larynx and pharyngeal wall, aspiration, respiratory compromise, laryngospasm, laryngeal edema and cardiac arrest. Throat pain typically lasts about one to two weeks after surgery.

Significant post-operative primary bleeding occurs in 0.2–2.2% of people, and secondary bleeding in 0.1–3.3%. 
In several reported case series, the rate of post tonsillectomy bleeding ranged from 2.0% to 7.0%.
Also in veterinary surgery, bleeding was a common complication. A meta-analysis reported that frequency of bleeding after tonsillectomy across different techniques did not differ.

It is estimated 1.3% of people will have a delayed discharge (of 4 to 24 hours) due to a complication, and up to 3.9% will require repeat admission to hospital. The main reasons for either keeping a person in hospital, or readmitting them after tonsillectomy are uncontrolled pain, vomiting, fever, or bleeding. Death occurs as a result in between 1 in 2,360 and 56,000 procedures. Bleeding accounts for one-third of deaths. As the procedure is done under general anesthesia, there are anesthesia risks.

=== Immune system ===
There is no evidence tonsillectomy affects long term immune function. It does not appear to affect the long term risk of infections in other areas of the body. Some studies have found small changes in immunoglobulin concentrations after tonsillectomy but these are of unclear significance. Tonsillectomy is a risk factor for Crohn&#x27;s disease. A 2024 meta-analysis found that tonsillectomy is associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis, with an odds ratio of 1.93 and 1.24, respectively. There is an association suggesting an increase in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis if done before the age of 20. A meta-analysis published in 2020 indicated a statistically significant association between a history of tonsillectomy and the development of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. A meta-analysis from 2022 concluded that a history of tonsillectomy is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The relationship between childhood tonsillectomy and the development of other cancer types in adulthood remains unclear.

==Surgical procedure==

For the past 50 years at least, tonsillectomy has been performed by dissecting the tonsil from its surrounding fascia, a so-called total, or extra-capsular tonsillectomy. Problems including pain and bleeding led to a recent resurgence in interest in sub-total tonsillectomy or &quot;tonsillotomy&quot;, which was popular 60 to 100 years ago, in an effort to reduce these complications. The generally accepted procedure for &#x27;total&#x27; tonsillectomy uses a scalpel and blunt dissection, electrocautery, or diathermy. Harmonic scalpels or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with electrocautery, ligation by sutures, and the topical use of thrombin, a protein that induces blood clotting. The most effective surgical approach has not been well studied.

It is not known whether the benefits of subtotal tonsillectomy in obstructive sleep apnea are enduring. But this is also the case for tonsillectomy for sleep apnea. There have been no randomised controlled trials of long term effectiveness of tonsillectomy for sleep apnea.

===Methods===
The scalpel is the preferred surgical instrument of many ear, nose, and throat specialists. However, there are other techniques and a brief review of each follows:

*Dissection and snare method: Removal of the tonsils by use of a forceps and scissors with a wire loop called a snare was formerly the most common method practiced by otolaryngologists, but has been largely replaced in favor of other techniques. The procedure requires the patient to undergo general anesthesia; the tonsils are completely removed and the remaining tissue surface is cauterized. The patient will leave with minimal post-operative bleeding.
*Electrocautery: Electrocautery uses electrical energy to separate the tonsillar tissue and assists in reducing blood loss through cauterization. Research has shown that the heat of electrocautery (400 °C) may result in thermal injury to surrounding tissue. This may result in more discomfort during the postoperative period.
*Radiofrequency ablation: Monopolar radiofrequency thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency energy to the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or local anesthesia. After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size over a period of several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.
*Coblation tonsillectomy: This surgical procedure is performed using plasma to remove the tonsils. Coblation technology combines radiofrequency energy and saline to create a plasma field. The plasma field is able to dissociate molecular bonds of target tissue while remaining relatively cool (40–70 °C), which results in minimal or no damage to surrounding healthy tissue. A Coblation tonsillectomy is carried out in an operating room setting, with the patient under general anesthesia. Tonsillectomies are generally performed for two main reasons: tonsillar hypertrophy (enlarged tonsils) and recurrent tonsillitis. It has been claimed that this technique results in less pain, faster healing, and less post operative care. However, review of 21 studies gives conflicting results about levels of pain, and its comparative safety has yet to be confirmed. This technique has been criticized for a higher than expected rate of bleeding presumably due to the low temperature which may be insufficient to seal the divided blood vessels but several papers offer conflicting (some positive, some negative) results. More recent studies of coblation tonsillectomy indicate reduced pain and ostalgia; less intraoperative or postoperative complications; lesser incidence of delayed hemorrhage, more significantly in pediatric populations, less postoperative pain and early return to daily activities, fewer secondary infections of the tonsil bed and significantly lower rates of secondary hemorrhage. Unlike the electrosurgery procedure, Coblation Tonsillectomy generates significantly lower temperatures on contacted tissue. Long-term studies seem to show that surgeons experienced with the technique have very few complications.
*Harmonic scalpel: This medical device uses ultrasonic vibrating of its blade at a frequency of 55 kHz. Invisible to the naked eye, the vibration transfers energy to the tissue, providing simultaneous cutting and coagulation. The temperature of the surrounding tissue reaches 80 °C. Proponents of this procedure assert that the result is precise cutting with minimal thermal damage.
*Thermal Welding: A new technology which uses pure thermal energy to seal and divide the tissue. The absence of thermal spread means that the temperature of surrounding tissue is only 2–3 °C higher than normal body temperature. Clinical papers show patients with minimal post-operative pain (no requirement for narcotic pain-killers), zero edema (swelling) plus almost no incidence of bleeding. Hospitals in the US are advertising this procedure as &quot;Painless Tonsillectomy&quot;. Also known as Tissue Welding.
*Carbon dioxide laser: When a laser is used to perform tonsillectomy, it can be under local anaesthetic with anaesthetic spray only, called tonsillotomy (or tonsil resurfacing or partial tonsillectomy), or it can be performed under general anaesthetic when it is called intra-capsular tonsillectomy, using an operating microscope for magnification. The carbon dioxide laser in scanning mode is an excellent vapouriser of tissue, and in conjunction with a computerised pattern generator and operating microscope with micromanipulator, it can result in near total removal of tonsil tissue whilst preserving the capsule of the tonsil. This leads to a significantly reduced bleeding and pain rate. The local anaesthetic technique takes around 10 minutes, the general around 20 minutes depending on the size of the tonsils - the bigger they are, the longer it takes. The general anaesthetic operation has a revision rate of 1:50, the local anaesthetic tonsillotomy 1:4.5. This is different from procedures where a laser is used to reduce or resurface the tonsils (e.g. laser cryptolysis). Providing the absence of certain contra-indications such as sensitive gag reflex, LAST can be performed under local anesthetic as an outpatient procedure. A carbon dioxide laser is commonly used, and is swept over each tonsil 8–10 times. The smoke is aspirated out of the mouth to prevent smoke inhalation. Often, more than one procedure is required, each lasting about 20 minutes. Due to the frequent requirement for multiple sessions, this treatment may work out more expensive than a single session tonsillectomy. A degree of patient compliance is required, making it unsuitable for young children and anxious persons, who risk harm if they move during the procedure.
*Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction often used during sinus surgery. It is made up of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils—not those that incur repeated infections.

===Medications===
A single dose of the corticosteroid drug dexamethasone may be given during surgery to prevent post-operative vomiting. A dose of dexamethasone during surgery prevents vomiting in one out of every five children. A dose of dexamethasone may help children return to a normal diet more quickly and have less post-operative pain. Many people are prescribed antibiotics following a tonsillectomy, however, the benefits and potential harms have not been well studied. Antibiotics are not suggested to be used routinely following tonsillectomy.

==Post-surgery care==
A sore throat will persist approximately two weeks following surgery while pain following the procedure is significant and may necessitate a hospital stay. Recovery can take from 7 to 10 days and proper hydration is very important during this time, since dehydration can increase throat pain, leading to a circle of poor fluid intake. Tonsillectomy appears to be more painful in adults than children. Controlling the pain following tonsillectomy is important to ensure that people can start eating again normally following the procedure.

At some point, most commonly 7 to 11 days after the surgery (but occasionally as long as two weeks after), bleeding can occur when scabs begin sloughing off from the surgical sites. The overall risk of bleeding is approximately 1–2%. It is higher in adults, especially males over age 70 and three-quarters of bleeding incidents occur on the same day as the surgery. Approximately 3% of adults develop bleeding at this time which may sometimes require surgical intervention.

Recommendations for pain management include ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen). The opioid codeine is not recommended for those less than 12 years old. There is a theoretical concern that NonSteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of bleeding but evidence does not support such a risk. Further research is required to determine if mouth rinses, mouthwashes and sprays help improve recovery following surgery.

Some surgeons recommend starting with a soft diet for two weeks before advancing to normal diet. This is to prevent any sharp foods from potentially irritating the tonsillar fossae during the healing stage and provoking a bleed.

== Rates ==
There are variations in tonsillectomy rates, both between and within countries. In 2015, tonsillectomy rates in the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and Norway were at least twice those in the UK but rates in Spain, Italy and Poland were at least a quarter lower. Tonsillectomy rates even vary considerably between neighbouring countries. For example, rates in Croatia are three times those in Slovenia. Variations between countries may be explained by a lack of or differences between guidelines. However differences in guidelines cannot explain the seven-fold variation between local authority areas within England.

In Germany tonsillectomy rates between regions differ by up to a factor of 8. A 2010 study in England found the annual tonsillectomy rate per 100,000 between 2000 and 2005 was 754 in the highest region, the national average was 304 and the lowest region was 102. This means there is a seven-fold difference between the region with the highest tonsillectomy rate and the region with the lowest one. In 2006, English Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson revealed that unnecessary tonsillectomies and unnecessary hysterectomies combined cost the British National Health Service 21 million pounds a year.

The rise in adenotonsillectomies for sleep apnea in the USA has been greater than the decline in tonsillectomies for sore throat.

=== Evidence-based indications ===
In 2018, a study of the medical records of 1.6 million UK children found 15,760 had sufficient sore throats to justify tonsillectomy and 13.6% (2,144) underwent surgery. The same study found 18,281 children who had undergone tonsillectomy, and of these only 11.7% (2,144) had evidence-based indications (i.e. frequent enough sore throats to justify surgery). The majority of tonsillectomies were undertaken for indications which did not have an evidence-base: five to six sore throats in one year (12.4%), two to four sore throats in one year (44.6%), sleep disordered breathing (12.3%), or obstructive sleep apnea (3.9%). In the UK therefore, most children who undergo tonsillectomy probably do not benefit and most children who might benefit do not undergo tonsillectomy. The study concluded that 32,500 (close to 90%) out of the 37,000 children who have their tonsils removed annually &quot;are unlikely to benefit&quot; and that surgery therefore may do more harm than good to those children. Tonsillectomy rates are lower in the UK than in most other western European countries.

=== Financial incentives ===
According to a study from 2009, surgery rates on average increase by 78% when surgeons are paid fee-for-service reimbursements instead of a fixed salary. Regarding tonsillectomy, a 1968 Canadian study pointed out that ENT specialists working on a fee-for-service programme were twice as likely to perform a tonsillectomy than those who were not. In 2009 then US President Obama remarked:
==History==

Tonsillectomies have been practiced for over 2,000 years, with varying popularity over the centuries. The earliest mention of the procedure is in &quot;Hindu medicine&quot; from about 1000 BCE. Roughly a millennium later, the Roman aristocrat Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BCE–50 CE) described a procedure whereby using the finger (or a blunt hook if necessary), the tonsil was separated from the neighboring tissue before being cut out. Galen (121–200 CE) was the first to advocate the use of the surgical instrument known as the snare, a practice that was to become common until Aetius (490 CE) recommended partial removal of the tonsil, writing &quot;Those who extirpate the entire tonsil remove, at the same time, structures that are perfectly healthy, and, in this way, give rise to serious Hæmorrhage&quot;. In the 7th century Paulus Aegineta (625–690) described a detailed procedure for tonsillectomy, including dealing with the inevitable post-operative bleeding. 1,200 years pass before the procedure is described again with such precision and detail.

The Middle Ages saw tonsillectomy fall into disfavor; Ambroise Pare (1509) wrote it to be &quot;a bad operation&quot; and suggested a procedure that involved gradual strangulation with a ligature. This method was not popular with the patients due to the immense pain it caused and the infection that usually followed. Scottish physician Peter Lowe in 1600 summarized the three methods in use at the time, including the &quot;snare&quot;, the &quot;ligature&quot;, and the &quot;excision&quot;. At the time, the function of the tonsils was thought to be absorption of secretions from the nose; it was assumed that removal of large amounts of tonsillar tissue would interfere with the ability to remove these secretions, causing them to accumulate in the larynx, resulting in hoarseness. For this reason, physicians like Dionis (1672) and Lorenz Heister censured the procedure.

In 1828, physician Philip Syng Physick modified an existing instrument originally designed by Benjamin Bell for removing the uvula; the instrument, known as the tonsil guillotine (and later as a tonsillotome), became the standard instrument for tonsil removal for over 80 years. By 1897, it became more common to perform complete rather than partial removal of the tonsil after American physician Ballenger noted that partial removal failed to completely alleviate symptoms in a majority of cases. His results using a technique involving removal of the tonsil with a scalpel and forceps were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.

In the beginning of the 20th century, tonsillectomy became more common in the United Kingdom and the United States and by the 1930s was very common in both countries. For example, a study conducted in 1934 found that 61% of 1,000 New York schoolchildren had been tonsillectomized; doctors recommended surgery for all but 65 of the remaining children. Complications were often simply accepted. The medical community considered enlarged tonsils a disease, attributing their enlargement to infection rather than a physiologic response. Because of the theory of focal infection, many surgeons believed that not only enlarged tonsils, but all tonsils should be removed. In the 1940s tonsillectomy became controversial as several studies linked it to bulbar poliomyelitis. From the 1940s to 1970s, further studies found an association between tonsillectomy and bulbar poliomyelitis with recommendations not to do the operation during outbreaks. Controversy surrounding tonsillectomy increased further in the United Kingdom in the 1960s because of the financial costs associated with the number of surgeries being performed and because of unexplainable variations in tonsillectomy rates between geographic regions and between social classes. In the media, tonsillectomy was criticised for being &quot;fashionable&quot; or a &quot;status symbol&quot;. There was also an increasing concern regarding the psychological and physical suffering of young children as a result of surgery. Furthermore, opponents of surgery argued that the tonsils should be retained whenever possible because of their role in the immune system and that the benefits of surgery were marginal. In the 1970s, tonsillectomy rates in the United Kingdom started to decline after several studies concluded that tonsillectomy was not as effective for sore throats and many other indications as previously thought. 

Tonsillectomy rates in the United States have declined since 1978, when experts of the National Institutes of Health concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the benefits of tonsillectomy outweighed the risks and therefore recommended more research, which subsequently led to stricter guidelines.

As doctors took a more conservative approach towards tonsillectomy, parental pressure became one of the most important reasons for surgery.

<doc id="331154" wikidata="Q379993" url="?curid=331154" title="Joseph Plateau">
<text>Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau (; 14 October 1801 – 15 September 1883) was a Belgian physicist and mathematician. He was one of the first people to demonstrate the illusion of a moving image. To do this, he used counterrotating disks with repeating drawn images in small increments of motion on one and regularly spaced slits in the other. He called this device of 1832 the phenakistiscope.

==Biography==
Plateau was born on 14 October 1801, in Brussels. His father, Antoine Plateau (fr) born in Tournai, was a talented flower painter. At the age of six, the younger Plateau already could read, making him a child prodigy in those times. While attending primary school, he was particularly impressed by a lesson of physics; enchanted by the experiments he observed, he vowed to discover their secrets someday. Plateau spent his school holidays in Marche-les-Dames, with his uncle and his family; his cousin and playfellow was Auguste Payen, who later became an architect and the principal designer of the Belgian railways. At the age of fourteen, he lost his father and mother; the trauma caused by this loss made him fall ill.

On 27 August 1840, Plateau married Augustine–Thérèse–Aimée–Fanny Clavareau, and they had a son a year later. His daughter Alice Plateau married in 1871, who became his collaborator and later his first biographer.

Fascinated by the persistence of luminous impressions on the retina, Plateau performed an experiment in which he gazed directly into the Sun for 25 seconds. He lost his eyesight later in his life and attributed the loss to this experiment. However, this may not have been the case, and he may have instead had chronic uveitis.

Plateau became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1872.

Plateau died in Ghent in 1883.

==Academic career==
Plateau studied at the State University of Liège, where he graduated as a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences in 1829.

In 1827, Plateau became a teacher of mathematics at the &quot;Atheneum&quot; school in Brussels. In 1835, he was appointed Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at the State University in Ghent.

==Research==
===Optics===

In 1829, Plateau submitted his doctoral thesis to his mentor Adolphe Quetelet for advice. It contained only 27 pages but formulated a great number of fundamental conclusions. It contained the first results of his research into the effect of colours on the retina (duration, intensity, and colour), his mathematical research into the intersections of revolving curves (locus), the observation of the distortion of moving images, and the reconstruction of distorted images through counter revolving discs (he dubbed these anorthoscopic discs).
In 1832, Plateau invented an early stroboscopic device, the &quot;phenakistiscope&quot;, the first device to give the illusion of a moving image. It consisted of two disks, one with small equidistant radial windows, through which the viewer could look, and another containing a sequence of images. When the two disks rotated at the correct speed, the synchronization of the windows and the images created an animated effect. The projection of stroboscopic photographs, creating the illusion of motion, eventually led to the development of cinema.

===Plateau&#x27;s problem===
Plateau also studied the phenomena of capillary action and surface tension. The mathematical problem of existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary is named after him. He conducted extensive studies of soap films and formulated Plateau&#x27;s laws, which describe the structures formed by such films in foams.

==Works==
** 

==In popular culture==
On 14 October 2019, the search engine Google commemorated Plateau with a Doodle on his 218th birth anniversary. This doodle was created by animator, filmmaker, and Doodler Olivia Huynh with inspiration and help from Diana Tran and Tom Tabanao. It is the first Google Doodle with different artwork showing up across different device displays—desktop, mobile, and the Google App.

<doc id="331155" wikidata="Q318005" url="?curid=331155" title="Nocturnal enuresis">
<text>Nocturnal enuresis (NE), also informally called bedwetting, is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which bladder control usually begins. Bedwetting in children and adults can result in emotional stress. Complications can include urinary tract infections.
Most bedwetting is a developmental delay—not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only a small percentage (5 to 10%) of bedwetting cases have a specific medical cause. Bedwetting is commonly associated with a family history of the condition. Nocturnal enuresis is considered &quot;primary&quot; when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. &quot;Secondary&quot; nocturnal enuresis is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.
Treatments range from behavioral therapy, such as bedwetting alarms, to medication, such as hormone replacement, and even surgery such as urethral dilatation. Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem. Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, warning about psychological consequences caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control.
Bedwetting is the most common childhood complaint.

==Impact==
A review of medical literature shows doctors consistently stressing that a bedwetting child is not at fault for the situation. Many medical studies state that the psychological impacts of bedwetting are more important than the physical considerations. &quot;It is often the child&#x27;s and family members&#x27; reaction to bedwetting that determines whether it is a problem or not.&quot;

===Self-esteem===
Whether bedwetting causes low self-esteem remains a subject of debate, but several studies have found that self-esteem improved with management of the condition.

Children questioned in one study ranked bedwetting as the third most stressful life event, after &quot;parental war of words&quot;, divorce and parental fighting. Adolescents in the same study ranked bedwetting as tied for second with parental fighting.

Bedwetters face problems ranging from being teased by siblings, being punished by parents, the embarrassment of still having to wear diapers, and being afraid that friends will find out.

Psychologists report that the amount of psychological harm depends on whether the bedwetting harms self-esteem or development of social skills. Key factors are:
* How much the bedwetting limits social activities like sleep-overs and campouts
* The degree of the social ostracism by peers
* (Perceived) Anger, punishment, refusal and rejection by caregivers along with subsequent guilt
* The number of failed treatment attempts
* How long the child has been wetting

===Behavioral impact===
Studies indicate that children with behavioral problems are more likely to wet their beds. For children who have developmental problems, the behavioral problems and the bedwetting are frequently part of/caused by the developmental issues. For bedwetting children without other developmental issues, these behavioral issues can result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.

As mentioned below, current studies show that it is very rare for a child to intentionally wet the bed as a method of acting out.

===Punishment for bedwetting===
Medical literature states, and studies show, that punishing or shaming a child for bedwetting will frequently make the situation worse. It is best described as a downward cycle, where a child punished for bedwetting feels shame and a loss of self-confidence. This can cause increased bedwetting incidents, leading to more punishment and shaming.

In the United States, about 25% of enuretic children are punished for wetting the bed. In Hong Kong, 57% of enuretic children are punished for wetting. Parents with only a grade-school level education punish bedwetting children at twice the rate of high-school- and college-educated parents.

In Korea and in small parts of Japan, there is a folk tradition whereby bedwetters are made to wear a winnowing basket on their head and sent to ask their neighbors for salt. This is motivated in part by a desire to publicly embarrass the child into compliance, as neighbors would recognize why the child was knocking on their door.

===Families===
Parents and family members are frequently stressed by a child&#x27;s bedwetting. Soiled linens and clothing cause additional laundry. Wetting episodes can cause lost sleep if the child wakes and/or cries, waking the parents. A European study estimated that a family with a child who wets nightly will pay about $1,000 a year for additional laundry, extra sheets, diapers, and mattress replacement.

Despite these stressful effects, doctors emphasize that parents should react patiently and supportively.

===Sociopathy===

Bedwetting does &quot;not&quot; indicate a greater possibility of being a sociopath, as long as caregivers do not cause trauma by shaming or punishing a bedwetting child. Bedwetting was part of the Macdonald triad, a set of three behavioral characteristics described by John Macdonald in 1963. The other two characteristics were firestarting and animal abuse. Macdonald suggested that there was an association between a person displaying all three characteristics, then later displaying sociopathic criminal behavior.

Up to 60% of multiple murderers, according to some estimates, wet their beds post-adolescence.

Enuresis is an &quot;unconscious, involuntary [...] act&quot;.

Bedwetting can be connected to past emotions and identity. Children under substantial stress, particularly in their home environment, frequently engage in bedwetting, in order to alleviate the stress produced by their surroundings. Trauma can also trigger a return to bedwetting (secondary enuresis) in both children and adults.

It is not bedwetting that increases the chance of criminal behavior, but the associated trauma. Parental cruelty can result in &quot;homicidal proneness&quot;.

==Causes==
The etiology of NE is not fully understood, although there are three common causes: excessive urine volume, poor sleep arousal, and bladder contractions. Differentiation of cause is mainly based on patient history and fluid charts completed by the parent or carer to inform management options.

Bedwetting has a strong genetic component. Children whose parents were not enuretic have only a 15% incidence of bedwetting. When one or both parents were bedwetters, the rates jump to 44% and 77% respectively.

These first two factors (aetiology and genetic component) are the most common in bedwetting, but current medical technology offers no easy testing for either cause. There is no test to prove that bedwetting is only a developmental delay, and genetic testing offers little or no benefit. As a result, other conditions should be ruled out. The following causes are less common, but are easier to prove and more clearly treated:

In some bedwetting children there is no increase in ADH (antidiuretic hormone) production, while other children may produce an increased amount of ADH but their response is insufficient.
* People with reported bedwetting issues are 2.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
* Caffeine increases urine production.
* Chronic constipation can cause bed wetting. When the bowels are full, it can put pressure on the bladder. Often such children defecate normally, yet they retain a significant mass of material in the bowel which causes bedwetting.
* Infections and disease are more strongly connected with &quot;secondary&quot; nocturnal enuresis and with daytime wetting. Less than 5% of all bedwetting cases are caused by infection or disease, the most common of which is a urinary tract infection.
* Patients with more severe neurological-developmental issues have a higher rate of bedwetting problems. One study of seven-year-olds showed that &quot;handicapped and intellectually disabled children&quot; had a bedwetting rate almost three times higher than &quot;non-handicapped children&quot; (26.6% vs. 9.5%, respectively).
* Psychological issues (e.g., death in the family, sexual abuse, extreme bullying) are established as a cause of secondary nocturnal enuresis (a return to bedwetting), but are very rarely a cause of PNE-type bedwetting. Bedwetting can also be a symptom of a pediatric neuropsychological disorder called PANDAS.
* Sleep apnea stemming from an upper airway obstruction has been associated with bedwetting. Snoring and enlarged tonsils or adenoids are a sign of potential sleep apnea problems.
* Sleepwalking can lead to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think they are in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, they usually think they are in the bathroom, and therefore urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating on the sofa, and simply urinating in the middle of the room.
* Stress is a cause of people who return to wetting the bed. Researchers find that moving to a new town, parent conflict or divorce, arrival of a new baby, or loss of a loved one or pet can cause insecurity, contributing to returning bedwetting.
* Type 1 diabetes mellitus can first present as nocturnal enuresis. It is classically associated with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; weight loss, lethargy, and diaper candidiasis may also be present in those with new-onset disease.
* Alcohol intoxication is a leading cause for nocturnal enuresis among adults. Alcohol suppresses the production of anti diuretic hormones and irritates the detrusor muscle in the bladder. These factors, paired with the large amount of fluid ingested, particularly during binge drinking sessions or when paired with caffeinated drinks, can lead to episodes of nocturnal enuresis.

===Unconfirmed===
* Food allergies may be part of the cause for some patients. This link is not well established, requiring further research.
* Improper toilet training is another disputed cause of bedwetting. This theory was more widely supported in the last century and is still cited by some authors today. Some say bedwetting can be caused by improper toilet training, either by starting the training when the child is too young or by being too forceful. Recent research has shown more mixed results and a connection to toilet training has not been proven or disproven. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, more child abuse occurs during potty training than in any other developmental stage.
* Dandelions are reputed to be a potent diuretic, and anecdotal reports and folk wisdom say children who handle them can end up wetting the bed. English folk names for the plant are &quot;peebeds&quot; and &quot;pissabeds&quot;. In French the dandelion is called &quot;pissenlit&quot;, which means &quot;piss in bed&quot;; likewise &quot;piscialletto&quot;, an Italian folkname, and &quot;meacamas&quot; in Spanish.

==Mechanism==
Two physical functions prevent bedwetting. The first is a hormone that reduces urine production at night. The second is the ability to wake up when the bladder is full. Children usually achieve nighttime dryness by developing one or both of these abilities. There appear to be some hereditary factors in how and when these develop.

The first ability is a hormone cycle that reduces the body&#x27;s urine production. At about sunset each day, the body releases a minute burst of antidiuretic hormone (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney&#x27;s urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it between the ages of two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.

The second ability that helps people stay dry is waking when the bladder is full. This ability develops in the same age range as the vasopressin hormone, but is separate from that hormone cycle.

The typical development process begins with one- and two-year-old children developing larger bladders and beginning to sense bladder fullness. Two- and three-year-old children begin to stay dry during the day. Four- and five-year-olds develop an adult pattern of urinary control and begin to stay dry at night.

==Diagnosis==

Thorough history regarding frequency of bedwetting, any period of dryness in between, associated daytime symptoms, constipation, and encopresis should be sought.

===Voiding diary===
* People are asked to observe, record and measure when and how much their child voids and drinks, as well as associated symptoms. A voiding diary in the form of a frequency volume chart records voided volume along with the time of each micturition for at least 24 hours. The frequency volume chart is enough for patients with complaints of nocturia and frequency only. If other symptoms are also present then a detailed bladder diary must be maintained. In a bladder diary, times of micturition and voided volume, incontinence episodes, pad usage, and other information such as fluid intake, the degree of urgency, and the degree of incontinence are recorded.

===Physical examination===
* Each child should be examined physically at least once at the beginning of treatment. A full pediatric and neurological exam is recommended. Measurement of blood pressure is important to rule out any renal pathology. External genitalia and lumbosacral spine should be examined thoroughly. A spinal defect, such as a dimple, hair tuft, or skin discoloration, might be visible in approximately 50% of patients with an intraspinal lesion. Thorough neurologic examination of the lower extremities, including gait, muscle power, tone, sensation, reflexes, and plantar responses should be done during first visit.

===Classification===
Nocturnal urinary continence is dependent on three factors: 1) nocturnal urine production, 2) nocturnal bladder function and 3) sleep and arousal mechanisms. Any child will experience nocturnal enuresis if more urine is produced than can be contained in the bladder or if the detrusor is hyperactive, provided that he or she is not awakened by the imminent bladder contraction.

====Primary nocturnal enuresis====
Primary nocturnal enuresis is the most common form of bedwetting. Bedwetting becomes a disorder when it persists after the age at which bladder control usually occurs (4–7 years), and is either resulting in an average of at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or not able to sleep dry without being taken to the toilet by another person.

New studies show that anti-psychotic drugs can have a side effect of causing enuresis.

It has been shown that diet impacts enuresis in children. Constipation from a poor diet can result in impacted stool in the colon putting undue pressure on the bladder creating loss of bladder control (overflow incontinence).

Some researchers, however, recommend a different starting age range. This guidance says that bedwetting can be considered a clinical problem if the child regularly wets the bed after turning 7 years old.

====Secondary nocturnal enuresis====
Secondary enuresis occurs &quot;after&quot; a patient goes through an extended period of dryness at night (six months or more) and then &quot;reverts&quot; to night-time wetting. Secondary enuresis can be caused by emotional stress or a medical condition, such as a bladder infection.

====Psychological definition====
Psychologists are usually allowed to diagnose and write a prescription for diapers if nocturnal enuresis causes the patient significant distress. Psychiatists may instead use a definition from the DSM-IV, defining nocturnal enuresis as repeated urination into bed or clothes, occurring twice per week or more for at least three consecutive months in a child of at least 5 years of age and not due to either a drug side effect or a medical condition.

==Management==
There are a number of management options for bedwetting. The following options apply when the bedwetting is not caused by a specifically identifiable medical condition such as a bladder abnormality or diabetes. Treatment is recommended when there is a specific medical condition such as bladder abnormalities, infection, or diabetes. It is also considered when bedwetting may harm the child&#x27;s self-esteem or relationships with family/friends. Only a small percentage of bedwetting is caused by a specific medical condition, so most treatment is prompted by concern for the child&#x27;s &quot;emotional&quot; welfare. Behavioral treatment of bedwetting overall tends to show increased self-esteem for children.

Parents become concerned much earlier than doctors. A study in 1980 asked parents and physicians the age that children should stay dry at night. The average parent response was 2.75 years old, while the average physician response was 5.13 years old.

Punishment is not effective and can interfere with treatment.

===Treatment approaches===
Simple behavioral methods are recommended as initial treatment. Other treatment methods include the following:
* Motivational therapy in nocturnal enuresis mainly involves parent and child education. Guilt should be allayed by providing facts. Fluids should be restricted 2 hours prior to bed. The child should be encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that they are dry. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. This method is particularly helpful in younger children (&lt;8 years) and will achieve dryness in 15-20% of the patients.
* Waiting: Almost all children will outgrow bedwetting. For this reason, urologists and pediatricians frequently recommend delaying treatment until the child is at least six or seven years old. Physicians may begin treatment earlier if they perceive the condition is damaging the child&#x27;s self-esteem and/or relationships with family/friends.
* Bedwetting alarms: Physicians also frequently suggest bedwetting alarms which sound a loud tone when they sense moisture. This can help condition the child to wake at the sensation of a full bladder. These alarms are considered more effective than no treatment and may have a lower risk of adverse events than some medical therapies but it is still uncertain if alarms are more effective than other treatments. There may be a 29% to 69% relapse rate, so the treatment may need to be repeated.
* DDAVP (desmopressin) tablets are a synthetic replacement for antidiuretic hormone, the hormone that reduces urine production during sleep. Desmopressin is usually used in the form of desmopressin acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP are 4.5 times more likely to stay dry than those taking a placebo. The drug replaces the hormone for that night with no cumulative effect. US drug regulators have banned using desmopressin nasal sprays for treating bedwetting since the oral form is considered safer.
* DDAVP is most efficient in children with nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine production greater than 130% of expected bladder capacity for age) and normal bladder reservoir function (maximum voided volume greater than 70% of expected bladder capacity for age). Other children who are likely candidates for desmopressin treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis.
* Tricyclic antidepressants: Tricyclic antidepressant prescription drugs with anti-muscarinic properties have been proven successful in treating bedwetting, but also have an increased risk of side effects, including death from overdose. These drugs include amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline. Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a placebo. The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.

===Condition management===
* Diapers: Wearing a diaper can reduce embarrassment for bedwetters and make cleanup easier for caregivers. These products are known as training pants or diapers when used for younger children, and as absorbent underwear or incontinence briefs when marketed for older children and adults. Some diapers are marketed especially for people with bedwetting. A major benefit is the reduced stress on both the bedwetter and caregivers. Wearing diapers can be especially beneficial for bedwetting children wishing to attend sleepovers or campouts, reducing emotional problems caused by social isolation and/or embarrassment in front of peers. According to a study of one adult with severe disabilities, extended diaper usage may interfere with learning to stay dry.
* Waterproof mattress pads are used in some cases to ease clean-up of bedwetting incidents, however they only protect the mattress, and the sheets, bedding or sleeping partner may be soiled.

===Unproven===
* Acupuncture: While acupuncture is safe in most adolescents, studies done to assess its effectiveness for nocturnal enuresis are of low quality.
* Dry bed training: Dry bed training is frequently waking the child at night. Studies show this training is ineffective by itself and does not increase the success rate when used in conjunction with a bedwetting alarm.
* Star chart: A star chart allows a child and parents to track dry nights, as a record and/or as part of a reward program. This can be done either alone or with other treatments. There is no research to show effectiveness, either in reducing bedwetting or in helping self-esteem. Some psychologists, however, recommend star charts as a way to celebrate successes and help a child&#x27;s self-esteem.

==Epidemiology==
Doctors frequently consider bedwetting as a self-limiting problem, since most children will outgrow it. Children 5 to 9 years old have a spontaneous cure rate of 14% per year. Adolescents 10 to 17 years old have a spontaneous cure rate of 16% per year.

As can be seen from the numbers above, a portion of bedwetting children will not outgrow the problem. Adult rates of bedwetting show little change due to spontaneous cure. Persons who are still enuretic at age 17 are likely to deal with bedwetting throughout their lives.

Studies of bedwetting in adults have found varying rates. The most quoted study in this area was done in the Netherlands. It found a 0.5% rate for 20- to 79-year-olds. A Hong Kong study, however, found a much higher rate. The Hong Kong researchers found a bedwetting rate of 2.3% in 16- to 40-year-olds.

==History==
In the first century B.C., at lines 1026-29 of the fourth book of his On the Nature of Things, Lucretius gave a high-style description of bed-wetting:

:&quot;Innocent children often, when they are bound up by sleep, believe they are raising up their clothing by a latrine or shallow pot; they pour out the urine from their whole body, and the Babylonian bedding with its magnificent splendor is soaked.&quot;

An early psychological perspective on bedwetting was given in 1025 by Avicenna in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;:
:&quot;Urinating in bed is frequently predisposed by deep sleep: when urine begins to flow, its inner nature and hidden will (resembling the will to breathe) drives urine out before the child awakes. When children become stronger and more robust, their sleep is lighter and they stop urinating.&quot;

Psychological theory through the 1960s placed much greater focus on the possibility that a bedwetting child might be acting out, purposefully striking back against parents by soiling linens and bedding. However, more recent research and medical literature states that this is very rare.

<doc id="331160" wikidata="Q291281" url="?curid=331160" title="Évariste Régis Huc">
<text>Évariste Régis Huc, C.M., also known as the [[Abbé]] Huc (1 August 1813 – 31 March 1860) was a French Catholic priest, Lazarite missionary, and traveller. He became famous for his accounts of Qing-era China, Mongolia (then known as &quot;Tartary&quot;), and especially the then-almost-unknown Tibet in his book &quot;Remembrances of a Journey in Tartary, Tibet, and China&quot;. He and his companion Joseph Gabet were the first Europeans who had reached Lhasa since Thomas Manning in 1812.

==Life==
===Early life===
Huc was born in Caylus in the department of Tarn-et-Garonne, France, on 1 August 1813. In 1837, at age 24, he entered the Congregation of the Mission (then better known as the &quot;Lazarites&quot;) at their priory in Paris. He took holy orders as a priest two years later.

===In China===

Shortly afterwards, he sought the chance to work at the Lazarite mission in China, which had replaced the Jesuits&#x27; in 1783. He studied mission work and Chinese at its seminary on Macao under J.G. Perboyre (later martyred and canonized as a saint) for eighteen months.

When his Chinese was considered sufficient, he disguised himself for work on the mainland by growing out his hair, cutting it into the obligatory queue, wearing loose Chinese garments, and dyeing his skin to a yellower shade. He took a ship up the Pearl River to Guangzhou (&quot;Canton&quot;) and oversaw a mission in the southern provinces for a time. He then traveled north to Beijing (&quot;Peking&quot;), where he improved his Mandarin.

===In Mongolia===
He then settled in the Valley of Black Waters or Heishui, north of Beijing and just within the borders of Mongolia. There, beyond the Great Wall of China, a large but scattered population of native Christians had taken refuge from the persecutions of the Jiaqing Emperor (&quot;Kia-king&quot;) who had added Christianity to China&#x27;s list of condemned superstitions and cults, threatening missionaries with execution and converts with enslavement to the Muslims of Xinjiang. Huc devoted himself to the study of the dialects and customs of the &quot;Tartars,&quot; for whom he translated several religious texts.

===Mission to Tibet===

Huc&#x27;s intention was to travel from China to Lhasa, and from there to India (much as Xuanzang had travelled via Tashkent, Samarkand and Taxila much earlier, in the 7th century).

This work prepared him for his journey to Tibet in 1844 at the instigation of the vicar apostolic of Mongolia. By September 1844 he reached Dolon Nor and made arrangements for his journey. Soon after, accompanied by his fellow-Vincentian, Joseph Gabet, and a young Mongour priest who had embraced Christianity, he set out. To escape attention the party assumed the dress of lamas or priests. Crossing the Yellow River, they advanced into the terrible sandy tract known as the Ordos Desert. After suffering dreadfully from want of water and fuel they entered Gansu, having recrossed the flooded Yellow River. Upon entering Kuen-Kiang-Hien both missionaries fell dreadfully ill and had to put the journey on hold to rest and recover. By January 1845 they reached Tang-Kiul on the boundary. Rather than take an independent four months journey to Lhasa, they waited eight months for a Tibetan embassy expected to return from Peking. Under an intelligent teacher they meanwhile studied the Tibetan language and Buddhist literature. During three months of their stay they resided in the ancient Kunbum Lamasery, which was said to accommodate 4,000 persons. In late September 1845 they joined the returning embassy, which comprised 2,000 men and 3,700 animals.

Crossing the deserts of Koko Nor (Qinghai), they passed the great Koko Nor lake, with its island of contemplative lamas. The missionaries, along with Evariste, engaged in prolonged and thoughtful conversations and meditations with these lamas, contributing to the entirety of their success in China. Lamas of these sorts possessed unimaginable magic power, and blessed them for the hot, wet journey ahead. After a difficult journey across snow-covered mountains, they entered Lhasa on 29 January 1846. Favourably received by the regent, they opened a little chapel. They had begun to establish their mission when Qishan, the Chinese resident interceded. During the First Opium War (1839–1842) Qishan, then the governor of Zhili Province, had entered into negotiations with Captain Charles Elliot, first at Dagu, then at Canton. His action being disapproved, Qishan had been degraded, sentenced to death, reprieved, then sent to Tibet as imperial commissioner. Sensing the potential trouble if Huc and Gabet were to reach India from Tibet, Qishan expelled Gabet and Huc from Lhasa on 26 February 1846 under guard. Following an official inquiry into their motives for being in Tibet, they were officially escorted to Canton in October 1846.

===In Guangzhou===
Abbé Gabet returned to Europe in late 1846 in the company of Alexander Johnston, secretary to John Francis Davis, British minister plenipotentiary to China. Davis reported Gabet&#x27;s exciting information with its strategic significance about Central Asia to Palmerston. Gabet went on to Rio de Janeiro, where he died soon afterwards.

Huc remained at Canton for nearly three years, writing his account of travels in China and Central Asia. His &quot;Remembrances of a Journey in Tartary, Tibet, and China&quot;, published in Paris in 1850, was well received.

===In Europe===
Huc returned to Europe in poor health in 1852, but he published a sequel to the &quot;Remembrances&quot; in 1854 and a large work on the entire history of Christianity in China, which came out in 1857 and 1858.

In his last years he took an active role in events in Cochin China. He urged Napoléon III to take action, saying, &quot;The Far East will soon be the theater of great events. If the emperor wills, France will be able to play an important and glorious role there.&quot; Napoleon took the first steps to establish a French colonial influence in East Asia. He launched a naval expedition in 1858 to punish the Vietnamese people for their mistreatment of French Catholic missionaries and demanded that the Vietnamese cede the port of Tourane and the island of Poulo-Condor, under an old treaty of 1787, which had never been used. This eventually led to a full-out invasion in 1861.

Huc died in Paris on 31 March 1860.

==Works==
His &quot;Remembrances of a Journey in Tartary, Tibet, and China during the Years 1844, 1845, and 1846&quot; () appeared in Paris in 1850. It was soon published in English, in 1851. A German translation appeared in Leipzig in 1855, followed by Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Russian and Czech (Prague, 1887). It was one of the favorite books of the writer Jaroslav Hašek. Popular editions followed, including an illustrated, simplified story text for schoolboys. It was abridged and translated by Julie Bedier as &quot;High Road in Tartary&quot; (1948).

Huc&#x27;s works are written in a lucid, spicy, picturesque style, securing for them an unusual degree of popularity. However, his esteem for Tibetan manners and religion was not welcomed by his Church: &quot;The late Abbé Huc pointed out the similarities between the Buddhist and Roman Catholic ceremonials with such a naïveté, that, to his surprise, he found his delightful &#x27;Travels in Thibet&#x27; placed on the &#x27;Index&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;Souvenirs&quot; is a narrative of a remarkable feat of travel. Huc was unjustly suspected of sensationalizing his travels. Although a careful observer, he was by no means a practical geographer. The record of his travels lacks precise scientific data. The authenticity of Huc&#x27;s journey was questioned by the Russian traveller, Nikolai Przhevalsky, but vindicated by others. Of course, both Huc and Gabet had written brief reports of their journey from 1847 on for the &quot;Annales de la Propagation de la Foi&quot; and the &quot;Annales de la Congrégation de la Mission&quot;. More recently, Huc&#x27;s writings have been criticized for presenting &#x27;facts&#x27; negatively because of his heavy western-European/Christian view point. Retrospectively, his writings could be considered in the same category as Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, aka a nonfiction novel.

The sequel, &quot;The Chinese Empire&quot; (1854) is a more comprehensive compendium of the religion, laws, usages and institutions of China, followed by a multi-volume history of Christianity in China and Central Asia. Huc gives many accounts of Chinese culture, and religion, including Christianity throughout the history of China. He also goes into detail about the three traditional Chinese religions, Daoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. In his attempt to spread Christianity he remarks on the status of women in China. During this time period women were expected to act in certain ways. As a married woman, you were expected to be a shadow of the man in the house. Being in this situation of social bondage inspired many women to convert to Christianity, which provided education and a social community.

At this time in China all religions were tolerated but there were three principal religions. Confucianism which is also known as &quot;The Doctrine of the Lettered&quot;. Confucius is regarded as the patriarch and reformer of the religion which gives its followers a positive outlook on life. The second religion is known as Taoism or the Primitive religion. Taught by a contemporary of Confucius Lao-tze this religion is similar to Confucianism. The priests and priestesses are sworn to celibacy and practice things such as magic, astrology, and necromancy. The last religion is Buddhism. This religion follows the teachings of the Buddha and ends ones suffering though his understanding of the four noble truths.

According to Huc, there is a Chinese law called Ta-tsing Luli. This is divided into seven portions as follows: 
General Laws, Civil Laws, Fiscal Laws, Ritual Laws, Military Laws, Criminal Laws, and laws concerning public works.

At the time of Huc it was general to regard Asia and China specifically as the classic ground of despotism and slavery, and Chinese people were considered as absolutely submissive to the authorities. However, while travelling through the Empire he came to the conclusion that religion, customs and prejudices opposed invincible obstacles to the free exercise of people&#x27;s will.

As a frequent symbol of Chinese people being opposed to the Government, he mentions principal gates with a large assortment of old boots. They appeared in almost every town of the Empire and were a clear visual sign of public&#x27;s opinion opposed to Government&#x27;s. Principal gates were also important monuments to show how many good Mandarins the country actually had despite calumnious reports and injustices experienced by many of them because of the Government&#x27;s influence.
