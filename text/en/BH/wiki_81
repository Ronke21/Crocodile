<text>The QWERTZ ( ) QWERTZU ( ), or QWERTZUIOP keyboard is a typewriter and keyboard layout widely used in Central and Southeast Europe. The name comes from the first six letters at the top left of the keyboard: ( ).

== Overview ==

The main difference between QWERTZ and QWERTY is that the positions of the and keys are switched (hence the nickname &quot;kezboard&quot;). This change possibly was made for three major reasons:
* is a much more common letter than in German; the latter appears only in loanwords (mainly from Ancient Greek) and in proper names such as Meyer (alongside Meier and various other variants).
* and often appear next to each other in the German orthography, and typewriter jamming would be reduced by placing the two keys so they could be typed with separate hands.
* and are also next to each other. , meaning &quot;to&quot; in German, and also a very common prefix can also be written very easily.

Similar to many other non-English keyboards:
* Part of the keyboard is adapted to include language-specific characters, e.g. umlauted vowels (&quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;) in German, Austrian, and Swiss (German) keyboards; and frequently used accented letters (é, è, à) in Swiss (French) keyboards. 
* QWERTZ keyboards usually change the right key into an key to access a third level of key assignments. This is necessary because the language-specific characters leave no room to have all the special symbols of ASCII, needed by programmers among others, available on the first or second (shifted) levels without unduly increasing the size of the keyboard.
* The placements of some special symbols are changed when compared to the English (UK and US) versions of QWERTY.

Some of the special key inscriptions are often changed from an abbreviation to a graphical symbol (for example becomes a hollow arrow pointing up, becomes a left-pointing arrow). In German and Austrian keyboards, most of the other abbreviated labels are in German: (control) is translated to its German equivalent &quot;Strg&quot; for &#x27;, and is abbreviated &quot;Entf&quot; (&#x27;). and on the numeric keypad are not translated, however. (See: Key labels)

==Variants==
The QWERTZ layout is widely used in German-speaking Europe as well as other Central European and Balkan countries that use the Latin script. While the core German-speaking countries use QWERTZ more or less exclusively, the situation among German-speakers in East Belgium, Luxembourg, and South Tyrol is more varied. The other countries using QWERTZ were historically parts of Austria-Hungary and/or had strong German technological, economic and cultural influences, which caused them to use German typewriters with the QWERTZ layout.

===Albanian===

QWERTZ is the default keyboard layout for the Albanian language in Microsoft Windows.

===Austria and Germany===
The PC keyboard layout commonly used in Germany and Austria is based on one defined in a former edition (October 1988) of the German standard DIN 2137-2. The current edition DIN 2137:2012-06 standardizes it as the first (basic) one of three layouts, calling it “T1” (&quot;&quot;, or “keyboard layout 1”).

It employs dead keys to type accented characters like , and the key to access characters in the third level (e.g. , , , the euro sign , or the micro- ). The “T2” layout as specified in the 2012 edition of the German standard also uses the group selection to access special characters like the long s, or foreign characters like “Æ” or “Ə”.

====Sorbian====
Sorbian QWERTZ is practically identical to the German layout, but the additional Sorbian characters can be entered with dead keys; it has three different layouts: Standard, Legacy, and Extended. All are supported by Microsoft Windows (Windows 7 and later only).
===Czech ===

The QWERTZ keyboard layout is commonly used in the Czech Republic, but the QWERTY variant is an unofficial option. The characters from the American keyboard (@#$&amp;\|[]{}&lt;&gt;^`~*) and some other characters and diacritic signs (÷×¤€ßĐđŁł°˘˝·˛¸) that are missing on the Czech mechanical typewriter keyboard can be accessed with the AltGr key. The layout on the picture is supported by Microsoft Windows. The QWERTZ layout is more efficient for Czech, as the letter Z is slightly more common than the letter Y, but only 4% more efficient than QWERTY.

An internet poll in 2013 stated that 56% of Czech users used QWERTZ and 44% used QWERTY, but in 2020 57% of Czech users used QWERTY and 43% used QWERTZ.
===Hungary===
On some keyboards, the &quot;&quot; key is located to the left of the Enter key, while on others it is placed to the left of the backspace key (see the two pictures on the right).

An unusual feature of this Hungarian keyboard layout is the position of the 0 (zero): it is located to the left of the 1, so that most of the accented characters can be together on the right side of the keyboard.

The official layout is of type QWERTZ, which is therefore the most widely used keyboard layout in the country. QWERTY used to be widespread due to there not being a dedicated Hungarian layout commonly available for older computers, but since this is no longer an issue, virtually everyone uses QWERTZ in everyday computing.

On &quot;ISO&quot; keyboards (as in the first picture) and &quot;BAE&quot; keyboards (as in the second), the key is positioned on the key to the right of the left key. To adapt to 101/104-key (ANSI) keyboards which do not have that key, the MS Windows QWERTY layout has put the Í on the usual key for the 0 (zero) while the 0 has been moved to that key&#x27;s tertiary () layer; on Macintosh computers, both layouts (QWERTY and QWERTZ) have this adaptation.
===Poland===


A variant of the QWERTZ keyboard has been used in Poland, but QWERTY keyboards have been dominant since the early 1990s.
=== Romanian ===
The standard keyboard layout as established by the standard SR 13392:2004 is QWERTY. However, a Romanian QWERTZ keyboard (corresponding to older standards) was set up on Windows 3.1 and renamed &quot;Romanian (Legacy)&quot; on all versions since Windows Vista, because of the introduction of the two standard QWERTY layouts with the correct diacritics. Since it was devised before the disunification of &quot;Ș&quot; (S-comma) and &quot;Ț&quot; (T-comma) with &quot;Ş&quot; (S-cedilla; used in Turkic languages) and &quot;Ţ&quot; (T cedilla), the characters with cedilla were used in the layout (and these are still used in the default 1250 encoding). In 2012, a version with commas was made and it is available as a custom layout to be installed by the interested end-user.
=== Slovak ===

Typewriters in Slovakia have used the QWERTZ layout quite similar to the layout used on the Czech typewriters. Slovak QWERTZ layout differs from the Czech one in using the letter instead of the Czech on the same position, also the letter is on the position of Czech and the letter is on the position of Czech . There are 2 more keys that differ in these 2 languages: Slovak key replaces the Czech key and Slovak key replaces the Czech key. There are 17 characters from American keyboard (@#$&amp;\|[]{}&lt;&gt;^`~*&#x27;) that are missing on the Slovak keyboard because of the presence of the Slovak letters (ľščňťžôúáíýéä°´ˇ§). Users can access them with the key, however, the position of these characters varies between different operating systems. Besides the QWERTZ keyboard layout inherited from the typewriter era, QWERTY layout is also used by computer users in Slovakia. The only difference is that the and keys are swapped.
===South Slavic Latin===

The Serbo-Croatian Latin and Slovene keyboard layout has five additional special characters Č, Ć, Ž, Š and Đ. This keyboard layout was standardized in the 1980s in Yugoslavia. Characters Ć and Đ are only part of Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet but not part of the Slovene alphabet, nevertheless they remain in Slovenian keyboards (for economic reasons, for historical reasons and for writing words in the closely related South Slavic languages). The Ž is on the right side of the Ć key on keyboards which have a longer backspace key, and the usual inverted L-shaped Enter key. The layout makes heavy use of the AltGr (right Alt) key for non-alphabetic characters and dead key combinations for adding diacritics to Latin characters. It is possible to type Albanian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Romanian, and Slovak using only the Serbo-Croatian keyboard layout.

There is a proposed variant of new Slovene keyboard layout, which would remove Ć and Đ from top layout and add @ instead. The command keys would also become translated into Slovene and some minor second level layout changes would be made.

For Serbian, there is also a Cyrillic keyboard variant, in which and are replaced with Љ (Lj) and Њ (Nj) respectively.

However, the Apple keyboards for Croatian are QWERTY.

=== Swiss (German, French, Italian, Romansh), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg===

The layout of the Swiss keyboard is established by the national standard SN 074021:1999. It is designed to allow easy access to frequently used accents of the French, German and Italian languages and major currency signs. It was designed from the beginning for usage with multiple languages (not only those spoken in Switzerland) in mind. The difference between the Swiss German () and the Swiss French () layout is that the German variety has the German umlauts (ä, ö, ü) accessible in the unshifted state, while the French version has some French accented characters (é, à, è) accessible in the unshifted state. The actual keyboards have the keys engraved for both variations; the difference is only in the driver (software) settings. In the latest versions of Windows there are also separately listed driver settings for Swiss Italian and Swiss Romansh, but they correspond to the Swiss French and Swiss German layout, respectively. In Mac OS X 10.6 and Linux, only Swiss French and Swiss German are available, and on iPadOS, the only layout for Switzerland is Swiss German.

As Swiss German does not make use of the esszett (ß) ligature, on Windows its keyboard lacks the symbol in contrast to the German and Austrian QWERTZ layouts. Linux and macOS typically assign ß to and respectively. While the German keyboard uses German labels for its keys (e.g. instead of ), Swiss keyboards use the English abbreviations as a &quot;neutral&quot; solution to avoid favouring or excluding any of the national languages of Switzerland.

Unlike the Windows keyboard layouts used in France and Belgium, the Swiss layout does not have a key dedicated to the accented letter “ù”. The MacOS layout typically assigns this letter to .

Luxembourg does not have a keyboard layout of its own. Public education and administration use the Swiss-French keyboard which also represents the Microsoft Windows standard keyboard layout for Luxembourg, while some in the private sector prefer the Belgian AZERTY or American QWERTY layouts. Liechtenstein also use the Swiss German layout without an ß character.

<text>AZERTY ( ) is a specific layout for the characters of the Latin alphabet on typewriter keys and computer keyboards. The layout takes its name from the first six letters to appear on the first row of alphabetical keys; that is, ( ). Like other European keyboard layouts, it is modelled on the English-language QWERTY layout. It is used in France and Belgium, though both countries have their own national variation on the layout.

The competing layouts devised for French (e.g. the 1907 ZHJAY layout, Claude Marsan&#x27;s 1976 layout, the 2002 Dvorak-fr, and the 2005 BÉPO layout) have obtained only limited recognition, although the latter has been included in the 2019 French keyboard layout standard.

== History ==

The AZERTY layout appeared in France in the last decade of the 19th century as a variation on American QWERTY typewriters. Its exact origin is unknown. It was more successful than its contemporaries (e.g. the French ZHJAYS layout created by Albert Navarre in the early 20th century) because of its similarity to the QWERTY layout and its initial popularity.

In France, the AZERTY layout is the de facto norm for keyboards. In 1976, a QWERTY layout adapted to the French language was put forward, as an experimental standard (NF XP E55-060) by AFNOR. This standard made provision for a temporary adaptation period during which the letters A, Q, Z and W could be positioned as in the traditional AZERTY layout.

In January 2016, the French Culture Ministry looked to replace the industrial AZERTY layout with one more suited to French. A standard was published by the French national organization for standardization in 2019.

== Description ==
The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some African countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout thus:
* and are swapped,
* and are swapped,
* is moved to the right of (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard),
* The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters,
* Caps lock is replaced by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a &quot;Caps lock&quot; key instead of a &quot;Shift lock&quot;.

The French and Belgian AZERTY keyboards also have special characters used in the French and Dutch language, such as é, è, ê, ï, ë, ... and other characters such as &amp;, &quot;, &#x27;, and ç (only for French), some located under the numbers and some with combinations of keys.

There are two key details:
* the Alt Gr key allows the user to type the character shown at the bottom right of any key with three characters.
* the Alt key is used as a shortcut to commands affecting windows, and is also used in conjunction with ASCII codes for typing special characters.

=== Accented letters ===
Certain letters are accented frequently enough that they are given their own keys rather than being used in combination with a dead key. These are é, à, è, ù and ç.

=== Dead keys ===
A dead key serves to modify the appearance of the next character to be typed on the keyboard. Dead keys are mainly used to generate accents (or diacritics) on vowels.

==== Circumflex ====
A circumflex can be generated by first striking the key (located to the right of in most AZERTY layouts), then the vowel requiring the accent (with the exception of y). For example, pressing then produces â.

==== Diaeresis ====
A diaresis can be generated by striking the key (in most AZERTY layouts, it is generated by combining the keys), then the vowel requiring the accent. For example, pressing then produces ä.

==== Grave accent ====
The grave accent can be generated by striking the key (in the French AZERTY layout it is located to the right of the key) on Macintosh keyboards, while on PC-type keyboards it can be generated by using the combination .

In the Belgian AZERTY layout, the grave accent is generated by the combination (the key is located to the right of the key on Belgian AZERTY keyboards), and then the key for the vowel requiring the accent.

Its main use is in typing letters used in other languages (e.g. Italian ò) and accented capital letters.

==== Acute accent ====
The acute accent is available under Windows by the use of , then the vowel requiring the accent. The é combination can be generated using its own key. For Linux users, it can be generated using then the vowel. On a Macintosh AZERTY keyboard, the acute accent is generated by a combination of the , keys, followed by the vowel.

In the Belgian AZERTY layout, a vowel with an acute accent can be generated by a combination of , then the vowel.

The acute accent is not available in the French layout on Windows.

Its main use is in typing letters used in other languages (e.g. Spanish á, í, ó, ú) and accented capital letters.

==== Tilde ====
The tilde is available under Windows by using a combination of the keys, followed by the letter requiring the tilde.

On Macs, the ñ can be obtained by the combination of keys, followed by the key.

In the Belgian AZERTY layout, ñ can be generated by a combination of .

Its main use is in typing letters used in other languages (e.g. Spanish ñ, Portuguese ã and õ) and accented capital letters.

=== Alt key ===

With some operating systems, the Alt key generates characters by means of their individual codes. In order to obtain characters, the Alt key must be pressed and held down while typing the relevant code into the numeric keypad.

On Linux, the Alt key gives direct access to French-language special characters. The ligatures œ and æ can be keyed in by using and respectively, in the fr-oss keyboard layout; their uppercase equivalents can be generated using the same key combinations plus the Shift key. Other useful punctuation symbols, such as ≤, ≥, or ≠, can be more easily accessed in the same way.

=== Guillemets « and » ===

Guillements are available under Windows through a combination of Alt commands.
With a US International Keyboard and corresponding layout, and can also be used. The characters are standard on French Canadian keyboards and some others.

Macintosh users can type « as and » as . (This applies to all English-language keyboard layouts supplied with the operating system, e.g. &quot;Australian&quot;, &quot;British&quot;, &quot;Canadian&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot;, &quot;Irish Extended&quot;, &quot;U.S.&quot; and &quot;U.S. Extended&quot;. Other language layouts may differ.) In French-language keyboard layouts and can be used. On Nordic keyboards, can be used for «, and can be used for ».

For users of Unix-like operating systems running the X Window System, creation of the guillemet depends on a number of factors including the keyboard layout that is in effect. For example, with the US International Keyboard layout selected, a user would type for « and for ». On some configurations they can be generated by typing « as and » as . With the compose key, press and . Additionally with the ibus input method framework enabled, users may enter these characters into those applications that accept it by using followed by their Unicode code points: either or , respectively.

In Microsoft Office applications, typing the US quotation mark (on the key) will produce either a left guillemet « or right guillemet » based on the spacing.

In X11, the window system common to many flavors of UNIX, the keyboard interface is completely configurable, allowing each user to assign different functions to each key in line with their personal preferences. For example, specific combinations of key could be assigned to many other characters.

=== Layout of the French keyboard under Microsoft Windows ===
==== Missing elements ====
* Ever since the AZERTY keyboard was devised, a single key has been dedicated to the letter ù, which occurs in only one word (où [where]); the œ is completely unrepresented, despite the fact that it is an integral part of the French spelling system and occurs in several common words like &quot;œil&quot; (eye) and &quot;œuvre&quot; (work).
* æ, as in &quot;Lætitia&quot; [girl&#x27;s name] or &quot;ex æquo&quot; [dead-heat], is also not represented.
* The non-breaking space, which prevents having punctuation characters in isolation at the ends or beginnings of lines, has no keyboard equivalent.
* The capital letters, É, Ç, and Œ (as in the word &quot;Œdipe&quot; [Oedipus], for example, or in the words œuf[s] (egg[s]), œil (eye), etc. when at the start of a sentence), are available neither on the typewriter itself, nor using the operating system mentioned earlier.

It is possible to fill in these gaps by installing a keyboard driver that has been specially enriched for the French language.

One can also use WinCompose in order to easily type all characters. The character codice_1 could be typed by pressing or the character codice_2 with , and there is also an option to allow typing accentuated capitals with such that codice_1 can be typed with .

Some word-processing software packages address some of these gaps. The non-breaking space can be obtained by pressing followed by a space, in a word-processing package such as OpenOffice.org Writer, or by using [Spacebar] in Microsoft Word.

Apart from these gaps, the French AZERTY layout has some strange features which are still present in the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system:
* The combination does not generate any character at all.
* The presence of two &quot;^&quot; keys, one of which is a dead key and is located at the right of the , while the otheron the keyis not.
* When a ¦ is required, a | is generated. (However, this is a common situation for many keyboards, not just AZERTY. The main issue for keyboard makers is that a solid vertical | keycap legend could be confused with a Capital letter I and so a broken vertical ¦ keycap helps clarify that it is not a letter but a symbol. In practice, most typists actually need the solid vertical rather than a broken vertical, so using a broken vertical keycap usually doesn&#x27;t cause problems.)
* Typing a period or numerals requires pressing Shift, whereas some rarer characters (ù, the semicolon) do not. This has led to drives to reform the AZERTY keyboard (chiefly by doing away with the ù, which may be typed using AltGr+è and u anyway, and/or swapping the period and semicolon), although to date this has not been successful.

=== Industrial layouts and French standard ===

In January 2016, the French Ministry of Culture, which is in charge of language affairs, expressed a will to offer an alternative to the AZERTY layouts traditionally proposed by the industry. The new layout would have to provide full coverage of the symbols required by French spelling (including accented capitals such as É) as well as other languages of France and European languages written with the Latin alphabet. The project, led by the French national organization for standardization AFNOR, released both this improved AZERTY and a BÉPO layout. Initially due in January 2018, the standard was released in April 2019.

The layout keeps the same placement for the 26 Latin letters and 10 digits, but moves others (such as some accented letters and punctuation signs), while it adds a range of other symbols (accessible with Shift, AltGr). There is easy access to guillemets « » (French quotes), accented capital letters: À, É, Ç, as well as Œ/œ, Æ/æ, which was not possible before on basic AZERTY (Windows&#x27; AZERTY); previously alt codes were required.

It allows typing words in many languages using dead keys, which are in blue on the picture, to access a variety of diacritics. A few mathematics symbols have also been added.

A website for the new AZERTY layout has been created, offering information, visuals of the changes, links to drivers to install the layout and various other resources.

== Differences between the Belgian and French layouts ==

The Belgian AZERTY keyboard allows for the placing of accents on vowels without recourse to encoding via the Alt key + code. This is made possible by the provision of dead keys for each type of accent: ^ ¨ ´ ` (the last two being generated by the combinations and respectively).

To recap the list of different keys from left to right and from top to bottom:
* First row (symbols and numbers):
** By combining the shift and ² keys, ³ is obtained;
** The symbol |, is generated by a combination of same key as the 1;
** The @ symbol is generated by a combination of same key as the 2;
** Unlike the French layout, the &#x27; key (or 4 key) does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s ¼;
** Unlike the French layout, the ( key (or 5 key) does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s ½;
** The ^ symbol is generated by a combination of same key as the 6; but, as opposed to the ^ symbol found to the right of the p key, it is not a dead key, and therefore does not generate the placing of a circumflex accent;
** Unlike the French layout, the è (or 7) key does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s {;
** Unlike the French layout, the ! (or 8) key does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s [;
** The { symbol is obtained by a combination of same key as the 9;
** The } symbol is obtained by a combination of same key as the 0;
** Unlike the French layout, the ) (or °) key does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s \;
** The key to the right of the key contains the following symbols: - _ with shift and, unlike the French layout, does not contain a third symbol. On Linux it&#x27;s the dead key ¸.
* Second row (the letters AZERTYuiop):
** the alphabetical keys do not have Alt Gr codes apart from the e, which generates the euro symbol, €;
** The [ symbol is obtained by a combination of same key as the ¨ (a partially dead key located to the right of the p key);
** the key to the right of the ^ key contains the following symbols: $ * with shift and ] with Alt Gr;
* Third row (the letters qsdfghjklm)
** the key to the right of m contains the following symbols: ù % with shift and the partially dead key ´ with Alt Gr, which allows acute accents to be generated on vowels;
** the key to the right of ù contains the following symbols: μ £ with shift and the partially dead key ` with Alt Gr, which allows grave accents to be generated on vowels;
* Fourth row (the letters wxcvbn and basic punctuation):
** The \ symbol is generated by a combination of ;
** the key to the right of : contains the following symbols: = + with shift and the partially dead key ~ with Alt Gr, the latter either generating the tilde symbol when combined with the space bar, or positioning a tilde over a letter: a → ã, A → Ã, n → ñ, N → Ñ, o → õ, O → Õ.

The description &quot;partially dead&quot; means that pressing the key in question sometimes generates the desired symbol directly, but that at least one of the symbols represented on the key will only appear after a second key has been pressed. In order to obtain a symbol in isolation, the space bar must be pressed, otherwise a vowel should be pressed to generate the desired accented form.

The other keys are identical, even though traditionally the names of special keys are printed on them in English. This is because Belgium is predominantly bilingual (French-Dutch) and officially trilingual (a third language, German, is spoken in the East Cantons).

The key to the right of 0 on the numeric keypad corresponds either to the full stop or to the comma (which is why there are two distinct keyboard drivers under Windows).

The AZERTY keyboard as used in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, uses the name shift instead of maj and caps lock instead of verr maj.

== Variants ==
Owing to its widespread usage in France, Belgium and some African countries, the AZERTY layout has several variants.

=== French ===

French-speaking people in the Canada use the Canadian Multilingual standard keyboard. It is the only keyboard layout provided by Microsoft Windows that allows to type the grapheme &quot;Œ/œ&quot;, needed by French spelling.

Although there is no evidence of usage in French-speaking countries, it can be noticed that the keyboard layout of Portugal (QWERTY-based) has a strictly better coverage of French spelling than the various variants of AZERTY (as available in Windows): indeed, it supports all diacritics of French (acute accent, grave accent, circumflex, diaeresis) as dead keys (allowing for those diacritics on both lowercase and uppercase letters), it has a separate key for &quot;ç&quot; (allowing it to be uppercased) and it even features the French guillemets &quot;«»&quot;; however, it lacks the grapheme &quot;œ/Œ&quot;, and lowercase accented letters of French are more cumbersome to type since they require pressing a dead key.

The &quot;US-International&quot; QWERTY layout supports French to the same extent than the Portugal&#x27;s layout does (diacritics as dead keys, French guillemets, but no &quot;œ/Œ&quot;). Some programmers prefer it over AZERTY, as it is closer to an international standard and allows easier input of ASCII punctuation characters which are used pervasively in programming languages. It can be used on a plain US-QWERTY keyboard, being an extension of it.

However, only AZERTY is widely sold in French shops.

Another alternative is the BÉPO layout, a French-language application of Dvorak&#x27;s principles for ergonomic typing. As of 2024, only a few specialized manufacturers sell keyboards with the BÉPO layout printed on it; however, its practitioners use to type blindly, without looking at the keys, for increased efficiency, if at a higher learning cost.
=== Apple ===

Apple&#x27;s keyboards use the same AZERTY layout in both France and Belgium. Based on the Belgian version, the most notable differences are the locations for the @-sign and €-sign, among others. MacOS also supports the standard French layout for non-Apple keyboards; the standard Belgian layout, however, is available through third-party support only.
=== Arabic ===
There is an Arabic variant of the AZERTY keyboard. It is especially used in the African countries Algeria, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and in Arab communities in French-speaking countries to be able to type both in Arabic and in French.

=== Tamazight (Berber) ===
The &quot;Tamazight (Latin)&quot; standards-compliant layout is optimised for a wide range of Tamazight (Berber) language variants – including Tuareg variants – rather than French, though French can still be typed quickly. It installs as &quot;Tamazight_L&quot; and can be used both on the French locale and with Tamazight locales.

QWERTY and QWERTZ adaptations of the layout are available for the physical keyboards used by major Amazigh (Berber) communities around the world.

Other layouts exist for closer backwards compatibility with the French layout. They are non-standards-compliant but convenient, allowing typing in Tifinagh script without switching layout:
* &quot;Tamazight (International)&quot; extends the French layout with Tamazight (Berber), and offers secondary Tifinagh script access by deadkey. It installs as &quot;Tamazight (Agraghlan)&quot; or &quot;Français+&quot; and is available from the official site of the Algerian High Council for Amazighity (HCA).
* &quot;Tamazight (International)+&quot; is optimised for Tamazight (Berber), but retains close French compatibility and provides easy typing in Tifinagh script by Caps Lock. It installs as &quot;Tamazight (Agraghlan)+&quot; or &quot;Tamazight_LF&quot;.

All the above layouts were designed by the Universal Amazigh Keyboard Project and are available from there.
=== Vietnamese ===

There is also a Vietnamese variant of the AZERTY keyboard. It was especially used in Vietnamese typewriters made until the 1980s.

=== Wolof ===
Wolof keyboards also use AZERTY and are supported by Microsoft Windows (Windows 7 and later only).

<doc id="335547" wikidata="Q468542" url="?curid=335547" title="Hanadi Jaradat">
<text>Hanadi Tayseer Abdul Malek Jaradat () (22 September 1975 – 4 October 2003) was a Palestinian terrorist from Jenin, who blew herself up on Saturday, 4 October 2003 in a suicide attack on Maxim restaurant, a Haifa restaurant co-owned by the same Jewish and Arab families for more than 40 years. She murdered 21 Jewish and Arab Israelis, and injured 51 other people. Among the dead were four Israeli children, including a two-month old infant, and five Arabs. She had been recruited by Islamic Jihad.

==Background==
Jaradat was born on 22 September 1975 in the West Bank city of Jenin. At the time of her suicide bombing attack, she was a 28-year-old (12 days away from being a 29-year-old) law student due to qualify as a lawyer in a few weeks. She had studied law at Yarmouk University in Jordan. 

Jaradat reportedly carried out the bombing in Haifa as an act of revenge after Israel Defense Forces undercover operatives in Jenin killed her cousin (Salah, 34) and her younger brother (Fadi, 25), both of whom were members of Islamic Jihad, with her cousin a senior member of the Al-Quds Brigades, in a clash. Earlier, when she was 21, her fiancé had been killed by Israeli security forces. Following the killing of her cousin and brother, Jaradat went into mourning and began to study the Koran and fast two days a week.

==Bombing==
On the day of the bombing, Saturday, 4 October 2003, she traveled from Jenin in the West Bank to Haifa. She traveled to Maxim Restaurant, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a rare oasis of coexistence between Arabs and Jews.&quot; The 22-pound body-belt bomb that she wore around her waist in order to feign pregnancy included nails, screws, ball bearings, and metal fragments packed around the four-kilogram high explosive core, that sprayed around Maxim restaurant, maximizing lethal effect. 

Maxim restaurant is a beachfront restaurant co-owned by Jews and Arabs in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. 21 Jewish and Arab Israelis were killed and 51 others injured. The victims included four Israeli children (one of whom was a two-month old infant). Jaradat had intentionally paused near a group of baby carriages in the center of the crowded restaurant. According to Haifa police sources, the aftermath was gruesome, with some of the dead still sitting upright at their tables, while others, including children and babies, were slammed against the walls. Due to the force of the explosion, all that remained of Jaradat was her head. Two of the Arabs killed, Sherbel Matar (aged 23) and Hana Francis (aged 39) came from the village of Fasouta. Jaradat was the sixth female suicide bomber of the Second Intifada and the second who had been recruited by Islamic Jihad. Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombing.

==Aftermath==
Commenting on his daughter, her father Taisir, who had worked in Israel for years as a house painter, said &quot;My daughter&#x27;s action reflected the anger that every Palestinian feels at the occupation. The occupation did not have mercy on my son Fadi, her brother. They killed him even though he was not a wanted person, they murdered him in cold blood before Hanadi&#x27;s eyes.&quot; He declined all condolences, instead saying that he was proud of what his daughter had done, and that &quot;I will accept only congratulations for what she did. This was a gift she gave me, the homeland and the Palestinian people. Therefore, I am not crying for her. Even though the most precious thing has been taken from me.&quot;

In reprisal for the suicide bombing, Israeli forces conducted a raid at 3:00 a.m. on 5 October 2003, during the course of which they demolished the Jaradat family home and the houses of two of her neighbours.

Maxim restaurant was quickly rebuilt and reopened.

==Honors and awards==
Jaradat was proclaimed by the Islamic Jihad as the &quot;Bride of Haifa&quot; to honor her &quot;marriage to the soil of her homeland&quot;, an honor it previously reserved only to men. Within several days of the bombing, trophy cards with her picture, labelled &quot;Hanadi the Bride of Haifa&quot;, were being handed out in Gaza.

In 2005, the Palestinian daily &quot;Al-Ayyam&quot; published a special supplement entitled &quot;What Did Hanadi Say&quot;, consisting of poems honoring Jaradat and calling for Jihad.

In October 2012, the Palestine Committee of the Arab Lawyers Union &quot;created the &#x27;Martyr Hanadi Jaradat plaque of honor&#x27; ... [and] conveyed to the family of Martyr Jaradat the good wishes of the head of the Union, Mr. Omar Al-Zayn… and also emphasized the pride of the Arab Lawyers Union for what their daughter had done in defense of Palestine and the nation&quot;, according to an October 14, 2012 report in the Palestinian daily publication &quot;Al-Ayyam&quot;. The union has a membership of bar associations in 15 countries and 27 affiliated organizations.

==Artwork and incident in Sweden==

Jaradat was the subject of Snow White and The Madness of Truth, a controversial item of installation art by Israeli-born Swedish composer and musician Dror Feiler, and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sköld-Feiler. It consisted of a portrait of Jaradat floating on a small white boat named &quot;Snövit&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;) in a long pool of blood red water. The artwork became the centre of controversy when the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, vandalized the installation. After pushing some lightstands into the pool, causing a short-circuit and disabling the light, Mazel told Feiler that &quot;This is not a work of art. This is an expression of hatred for the Israeli people. This has glorified suicide bombers&quot;. Further, he said to the press that the piece constituted a &quot;complete legitimization of genocide, the murder of innocent people, innocent civilians, under the guise of culture&quot;. Feiler rejected charges that their intention was to glorify suicide bombers and accused Mazel of &quot;practicing censorship&quot;. He said the installation was made to &quot;call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things&quot;. Following the incident, Mazel said: &quot;I was standing before an exhibit calling for genocide, praising the genocide of me, you, my brothers and sisters.&quot;

<text>&quot;If—&quot; is a poem by English poet Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), written circa 1895 as a tribute to Leander Starr Jameson. It is a literary example of Victorian-era stoicism. The poem, first published in &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; (1910) following the story &quot;Brother Square-Toes&quot;, is written in the form of paternal advice to the poet&#x27;s son, John.

==Publication==
&quot;If—&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Brother Square Toes&quot; chapter of the book &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;, a collection of Kipling&#x27;s poetry and short-story fiction published in 1910. In his posthumously published autobiography, &quot;Something of Myself&quot; (1937), Kipling said that, in writing the poem, he was inspired by the character of Leander Starr Jameson, leader of the failed Jameson Raid against the South African Republic to overthrow the Boer government of Paul Kruger. The failure of that mercenary coup d&#x27;état aggravated the political tensions between the United Kingdom and the Boers, which led to the Second Boer War (1899–1902).

==Text==
==Reception==
As an evocation of Victorian-era stoicism, the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; self-discipline that popular culture rendered into a British national virtue and character trait, &quot;If—&quot; remains a cultural touchstone. The British cultural-artifact status of the poem is evidenced by the parodies of the poem, and by its popularity among Britons.

Kipling himself in the last year of his life took wry note of the poem&#x27;s ubiquity:
Once started, the mechanisation of the age made [the verses] snowball themselves in a way that startled me. Schools, and places where they teach, took them for the suffering Young—which did me no good with the Young when I met them later. (&#x27;Why did you write that stuff? I’ve had to write it out twice as an impot.&#x27;) They were printed as cards to hang up in offices and bedrooms; illuminated text-wise and anthologised to weariness. Twenty-seven of the Nations of the Earth translated them into their seven-and-twenty tongues, and printed them on every sort of fabric.

In 1931, Elizabeth Lincoln Otis wrote &quot;An &#x27;If&#x27; for Girls&quot; in response to Kipling&#x27;s poem. Otis&#x27;s poem was published in the anthology &quot;Father: An Anthology of Verse&quot; (1931).

T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection &quot;A Choice of Kipling&#x27;s Verse&quot;.

In India, a framed copy of the poem was affixed to the wall before the study desk in the cabins of the officer cadets at the National Defence Academy at Pune and the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala. In Britain, the first verse is set, in granite setts, into the pavement of the promenade in Westward Ho! in Devon. The third and fourth lines of the second stanza of the poem: &quot;If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / and treat those two impostors just the same&quot; are written on the wall of the players&#x27; entrance to the Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, where the Wimbledon Championships are held. These same lines appear at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York City, where the US Open was played until 1977.

The Indian writer Khushwant Singh considered the poem &quot;the essence of the message of &quot;The Gita&quot; in English.&quot;

Charles McGrath, a former deputy editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and a former editor of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, wrote that when he was in school, &quot;they had to recite Kipling&#x27;s &#x27;If—&#x27; every day, right after the Pledge of Allegiance.&quot;

Pablo Neruda—like Kipling, a Nobel laureate—found a framed ornamental copy of the poem near the Duke of Alba&#x27;s bedside in the Palacio de Liria. However, his view was not favourable, and he referred to it as &quot;that pedestrian and sanctimonious poetry, precursor of the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, whose intellectual level seems to me no higher than that of the Duke of Alba&#x27;s boots.&quot;

In the BBC&#x27;s 1996 nationwide poll, &quot;If—&quot; was voted the UK&#x27;s favourite poem, gaining twice as many votes as the runner-up.

The boxer Muhammad Ali was known to carry the poem in his wallet throughout his life as a guiding principle.

In 2006, the French philosopher Olivier Rey called &quot;If—&quot; an example of paternal tyranny, in which the father imposes a list of impossible conditions on his son.

<doc id="335554" wikidata="Q754885" url="?curid=335554" title="Ring-billed gull">
<text>The ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) is a medium-sized gull native to North America, breeding in Canada and the northern Contiguous United States, and wintering mainly in the United States and northern Mexico. The genus name is from Latin &quot;Larus&quot; which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific &quot;delawarensis&quot; refers to the Delaware River.

==Description==

The ring-billed gull is a medium-sized gull, having an average length of and a wingspan that ranges from . Adults weigh from .

The head, neck and underparts are white; the relatively short bill is yellow with a black ring; the back and wings are silver grey with black wingtips with white &#x27;mirrors&#x27;; and the legs are yellow. The eyes are yellow with red rims. This gull takes three years to reach its breeding plumage starting with the largely brown juvenile plumage, its appearance changing with each fall moult. 

The average lifespan of an individual that reaches adulthood is 10.9 years The oldest ring-billed gull on record was observed in Cleveland in 2021, still alive at the age of 28 years.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding habitat is near lakes, rivers, or the coast across most of Canada, and the northern United States. They nest colonially on the ground, often on islands, but also increasingly on flat factory roofs. This bird tends to be faithful to its nesting site, if not its mate, from year to year.

The ring-billed gull is a familiar sight in North American parking lots, where it can regularly be found congregating in large numbers. In some areas, it is displacing less aggressive birds such as the common tern.

They are migratory and most move south to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and northern Mexico; some remain in Canada in winter in the mildest areas, on the Pacific coast in southwest British Columbia, and on the Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia.

=== Vagrancy ===
This gull is a regular wanderer to western Europe. In Ireland and Great Britain it is no longer classed as a rarity, with multiple birds regularly wintering in those countries, though has become rarer again since about 2010. The peak period of occurrence was in the 1990s with on average 77 each year in Great Britain, but this fell to just 16 per year in the 2010s, and only six per year in 2020–2022 (which, at under ten per year, would reclassify it as an official rarity if continued over a decade). This contrasts markedly with Bonaparte&#x27;s gull, another transatlantic visitor, which has increased in Great Britain from averages of six per year to 12 per year over the same period; the reasons for these contrasting changes are unknown.

==Diet==

Ring-billed gulls forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming, walking or wading. They also steal food from other birds and frequently scavenge. They are omnivorous; their diet may include insects, fish, grain, eggs, earthworms and rodents. These birds are opportunistic and have adapted well to taking food when discarded or even left unattended by people. It is regarded as a pest by many beach-goers because of its willingness to steal unguarded food on crowded beaches. The birds congregate at beaches, marinas, docks and parks where people will hand feed them.

The gull&#x27;s natural predators are rats, foxes, dogs, cats, raccoons, coyotes, eagles, hawks (although they have been seen in pairs chasing hawks), and owls.

== Status ==
In the late 19th century, the ring-billed gull was hunted for its plumage. Its population has since rebounded and it is probably the most common gull in North America. The population was estimated in 2006 as 2.55 million birds.

<text>The Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) is the smallest owl in Europe. It is a dark reddish to greyish-brown, with spotted sides and half of a white ring around the back of the neck. This species is found in the boreal forests of Northern and Central Europe to Siberia.

This is a sedentary species, meaning that adults are resident throughout the year in its range. The exception may be during harsh winters, when the adults may move south. Young of the species usually move in autumn or winter.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian pygmy owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Strix passerina&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;passerinus&quot; meaning &quot;sparrow-like&quot; implying &quot;sparrow sized&quot;. This owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. p. passerinum&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – central, north Europe to southwest Siberia
* &quot;G. p. orientale&quot; Taczanowski, 1891 – central, east Siberia, Mongolia and northeast China

==Description==
The Eurasian pygmy owl is usually red-tinged to a greyish-brown with dots on its back. The tail is generally darker than the body with five narrow, whitish bars. It has a small, short head with white to grey eyebrows and yellow eyes. It lacks the ear tufts that many other owls have. There is a white half-collar on the back of the neck. The belly is mostly white with brown speckles. The beak is a greyish-yellow and hook-shaped.

In order to be able to carry larger vertebrate prey, it has evolved disproportionately large feet. The legs and toes are a brownish-yellow with black talons. Females are long, and males are generally smaller, measuring in length. Females are about , and males are in weight.

===Vocalisation===
The call of the Eurasian pygmy owl is much higher in pitch than what is generally perceived as a normal owl &quot;hoot&quot;. The call of the male is a monotonous chain of clear, fluted notes spaced by about two seconds. The call of the female is similar, but higher in pitch. Before and after the mating season, both males and females make a five to seven note rise on the pitch scale.

==Distribution and habitat==
This owl can be found primarily in coniferous forests of the taiga and higher mountainous regions with coniferous and mixed forests. These areas generally have cooler temperatures and higher rainfall than nearby lowland regions. The owl usually lives along the edges of clearings surrounded by moist or swampy land, generally with a water source nearby. It nests in old woodpecker holes, often those of the great spotted woodpecker.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This owl is crepuscular, being active during the daylight hours near sunrise and sunset.

===Breeding===
This owl nests in tree cavities, often in old woodpecker holes. It prefers conifers but will occupy birches and beeches. Pairs form in autumn through early spring. During courtship the male leads the female through his territory. If he has obtained a nest hole, he leads her to it. The male will also feed the female.

This species is serially monogamous, forming bonded pairs for one or more breeding seasons. The male is territorial and may use the same nesting territory for up to seven years. The female lays about four to seven eggs, generally in April. They are incubated for four weeks, starting when the third egg is laid. They hatch nearly simultaneously and the female remains with them for nine to ten days, being fed by the male.

After three weeks the young are active and the female returns to the nest only to feed them and clean out waste. Fledging occurs at 30 to 34 days. The chicks remain close to the nest for a few days before departing.

===Food and feeding===
The diet of the Eurasian pygmy owl includes mostly small mammals, such as voles, lemmings, bats, and mice, and small birds such as thrushes, crossbills, chaffinches, and leaf-warblers. They are able to catch birds in flight. Other prey items may include lizards, fish, and insects. Pygmy owls store large quantities of small mammals and birds in the food stores they collect in the autumn and that will be used throughout the winter to supplement their diet. Their food hoarding behaviour is deeply influenced by weather conditions, making them susceptible to climatic changes.

<text>John Alston Maxton, Baron Maxton (born 5 May 1936) is a Scottish Labour Party politician. From 1979 to 2001 he was a backbencher Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons.

==Early life==
He is a nephew of the former Independent Labour Party leader and World War I conscientious objector, James Maxton. His father, also named John Maxton, was also a conscientious objector in World War I, and the younger John Maxton was himself a conscientious objector from 1955 to 1957, working on building sites and in farming. He was educated at Lord Williams&#x27;s Grammar School, Thame, and subsequently attended University College, Oxford.

==Political career==
He joined the Labour Party in 1970 and became a prominent campaigner as Vice Chairman of the group Scottish Labour Against the Market during the 1975 referendum on continuing British membership of the Common Market. He was selected to oppose the sitting MP, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, Teddy Taylor, at the 1979 general election in the Glasgow Cathcart constituency. The changing demographics of the area and Labour&#x27;s increasing popularity in Scotland made it a winnable seat, and Maxton&#x27;s victory was made more likely by the Conservative Party&#x27;s strident opposition to the Scottish National Party, which drove some of its voters back to Labour.

Maxton was the only Labour candidate at that election to gain a seat won by the Conservatives at the previous general election. In Parliament, he allied with the left in the Tribune Group, and voted against the Falklands War. In 1983, his constituency was redrawn to his disadvantage, but Maxton ruled out a move to any neighbouring and more favourable areas; he therefore notionally gained his seat from the Conservatives again in the 1983 general election. Maxton was a popular backbencher, but did not obtain much support when he stood for election to the Labour shadow cabinet. He was Labour&#x27;s Scottish Whip in 1985 and a spokesman on Scottish Affairs from 1985 to 1992.

He stood down from the House of Commons at the 2001 general election and was given a life peerage on 17 June 2004, as Baron Maxton, of Blackwaterfoot in Ayrshire and Arran.

<text>The European fallow deer (Dama dama), also known as the common fallow deer or simply fallow deer, is a species of deer native to Eurasia. It is one of two living species of fallow deer alongside the Persian fallow deer (&quot;Dama mesapotamica&quot;). It is historically native to Turkey and possibly the Italian Peninsula, Balkan Peninsula, and the island of Rhodes near Anatolia. During the Pleistocene it inhabited much of Europe, and has been reintroduced to its prehistoric distribution by humans. It has also been introduced to other regions in the world.

==Taxonomy==
Some taxonomists include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (&quot;D. d. mesopotamica&quot;), with both species being grouped together as the fallow deer, while others treat it as a different species (&quot;D. mesopotamica&quot;). The white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) was once classified as &quot;Dama virginiana&quot; and the mule deer or black-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) as &quot;Dama hemionus&quot;; they were given a separate genus in the 19th century.

==Description==
The male fallow deer is known as a buck, the female is a doe, and the young a fawn. Adult bucks are long, in shoulder height, and typically in weight; does are long, in shoulder height, and in weight. The largest bucks may measure long and weigh . Fawns are born in spring around and weigh around . Their lifespan is around 12–16 years.

Much variation occurs in the coat colour of the species, with four main variants: common, menil, melanistic, and leucistic – a genuine colour variety, not albinistic. White is the lightest coloured, almost white; common and menil are darker, and melanistic is very dark, sometimes even black (and is easily confused with the sika deer).

* Common: Chestnut coat with white mottles, it is most pronounced in summer with a much darker, unspotted coat in the winter. The light-coloured area around the tail is edged with black. The tail is light with a black stripe.
* Menil: Spots are more distinct than common in summer and no black is seen around the rump patch or on the tail. In winter, spots are still clear on a darker brown coat.
* Melanistic (black): All year the coat is black, shading to greyish-brown. No light-coloured tail patch or spots are seen.

* Leucistic (white, but not albino): Fawns are cream-coloured; adults become pure white, especially in winter. Dark eyes and nose are seen. The coat has no spots.

Most herds consist of the common coat variation, yet animals of the menil coat variation are not rare. The melanistic coat variation is generally rarer, and the white coat variation is very much rarer still, although wild New Zealand herds often have a high melanistic percentage.

Only bucks have antlers, which are broad and shovel-shaped (palmate) from three years. In the first two years the antler is a single spike. Their preferred habitat is mixed woodland and open grassland. During the rut, bucks spread out and females move between them; at that time of year fallow deer are relatively ungrouped compared with the rest of the year, when they try to stay together in groups of up to 150.

Agile and fast in case of danger, fallow deer can run at a maximum speed of over short distances. Being naturally less muscular than other cervids such as the roe deer, they are not as fast. Fallow deer can also jump up to high and up to in length.

The diet of the European fallow deer has been described as highly flexible, and able to adapt to local conditions. A 1977 study of European fallow deer in the New Forest of Britain found that European fallow deer were selective mixed feeders, feeding primarily on grass (and to a less extend on herbs and browse) during the spring and summer (March–September), while primarily feeding on acorns and other mast during autumn (from September) until late December, with winter foods including grass as well as shrubs like brambles, bilberry, heather, holly, as well as ivy and coniferous material. 

==Distribution==
During the Last Interglacial (also known as the Eemian) around 130-115,000 years ago and prior, European fallow deer were widely distributed over Europe, occurring as far north as the British Isles. During the Last Glacial Period (115,000-11,700 years ago) the range of the species collapsed due to unfavourable climate conditions, surviving in refugia in Anatolia and probably the Balkans and possibly elsewhere, though the fossil record of their distribution during this time is sparse.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey is the only country known to have definitively natural populations of European fallow deer since the Last Glacial Maximum, but populations there (alongside those of the Persian fallow deer, which also formerly occurred in Turkey) have since become endangered and almost fully extirpated. European fallow deer in Anatolia underwent a major population decline due to the spread of agriculture (leading to the deforestation of lowland forests) and hunting, and populations in the Marmara and Aegean regions went extinct by the turn of the 20th century. Other wild populations of Turkish fallow deer survived for longer on islands at Ayvalık Islands Nature Park, Gökova, and Adaköy near Marmaris, but also appear to have died out in recent years. Currently, the only extant wild population of the species known to be undoubtedly natural lives in Düzlerçami Game Reserve in the Mount Güllük-Termessos National Park in southern Turkey, although the area has been largely fenced since, making the population only semi-wild. This population is very few in number and is genetically distinct from other European fallow deer.

A 2024 study suggests that the Turkish populations of fallow deer are ancestral to most fallow deer found throughout Europe as well as introduced populations worldwide. The translocations of fallow deer out of Turkey were facilitated by Roman-era trade networks. The only other refugium found was one in the Balkans, whose surviving descendants are significantly fewer in number.

===Native but originally extinct===

==== Southern Balkans ====
On mainland Greece and some Greek islands, such as Corfu, Kythira, and Thasos, that were connected to mainland due to lower sea level or proximity to land, fallow deer were present during the last ice age. A belief arose that the species was almost extinct in Greece, returning during the Neolithic. Contrary to that, remains indicate that reduced numbers survived in several parts of the country like in Thessaly, Peloponnese and Central Greece, increasing and becoming common during mid Neolithic, but mostly east of Pindus mountain range and especially in Macedonia and Thrace. During the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age, the species survived on the islands of Corfu and Thasos, appeared on Euboea, and began to be introduced by man to other islands, including Crete, some of the Cyclades, Rhodes, Chios, Lesbos, Samos and Sporades. Early-historic-period remains have been found in eastern Greece and on the islands of Thasos, Chios, Rhodes and Crete. A few surviving individuals were observed on Samos in 1700, while the species became extinct on Lesbos late in the Ottoman period. On the Greek mainland, wild fallow deer survived until the 16th century in northeastern Chalkidiki, until the 19th century in the forests of Mount Olympus, Vermio Mountains, Arakynthos, Evrytania and Boeotia and until the 1910s in Thesprotia. The last individuals were hunted in Acarnania during the 1930s.

In Bulgaria, the autochthonous population of fallow deer is believed to have declined and disappeared after the 9th or 10th centuries, and the species was reintroduced there much more recently. The species remained in European Turkey into the 19th century. A male fallow deer was captured in Thrace in 1977 and translocated to Düzlerçamı, suggesting that a small population existed there at that time. In Albania (possibly in Butrint), the fallow deer seemed to be plentiful during the first half of the 19th century.

A 2024 genetic study suggests that the Balkans served as one of two refugia for fallow deer during the glacial periods, alongside Anatolia. Members of this population were also translocated around Europe during the Iron Age and Roman Empire, but have largely been replaced by Turkish-origin fallow deer (including in their native Balkans) aside from parts of southern Europe. The Balkan fallow deer are thought to represent the ancestors of modern Iberian, Italian, and Rhodes fallow deer, with the Rhodes population dating back to Neolithic translocations.

==== Possible native populations ====
Aside from Turkey, other areas of Europe that could have potentially served as refuges for the species during the last ice age include parts of the eastern Mediterranean, including most of the Italian Peninsula, parts of the Balkans, and the Greek island of Rhodes, all of which still host populations of this species. However, palaeontological and archaeozoological evidence of the species&#x27; diffusion into these areas during the ice age is very fragmentary, thus whether the present populations in these areas are truly native descendants of relict populations or were introduced by humans is unknown. Presently, the IUCN Red List&#x27;s range map lists European fallow deer as being native to Italy, Turkey, Rhodes, and most of the Balkans, as having a population of uncertain origin in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, and being introduced to the rest of Europe. In the text, though, all the eastern Mediterranean populations aside from Turkey are listed as having an uncertain origin. A 2024 study suggests that Italian and Iberian populations descend from a now-extinct Balkan population that was translocated early on.

==== Rhodes, Greece ====
The Rhodian population of European fallow deer is smaller on average than those of central and northern Europe, though they are similarly coloured. European fallow deer are said to have been introduced to Rhodes in Neolithic times; although fossils of the species on Rhodes do indeed go back to Neolithic times, no major evidence has been found of domestication, so they could be considered native. In 2005, the Rhodian fallow deer was found to be genetically distinct from all other populations and to be of urgent conservation concern. At the entrance to the harbour of Rhodes city, statues of a fallow deer buck and doe now grace the location where the Colossus of Rhodes once stood. A 2024 study suggests them to be a basal lineage of the Balkan fallow deer, originating from a very early translocation.

===Introduced===
Outside of Europe, this species has been introduced to Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Cape Verde, Chile, the Comoros, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, Fernando Pó, Israel, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Réunion, São Tomé, the Seychelles, South Africa, Tunisia, and the United States.

==== Australia ====
European fallow deer were introduced to Tasmania in 1830 and to mainland Australia in the 1880s. The deer can now be found in all Australian jurisdictions, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The European fallow deer is the most widespread and numerous of introduced deer species in Australia. Proper control of deer populations in New South Wales (NSW) was precluded for some years by the classification of these deer as &quot;game animals&quot;, as well as being a feral pest species. This led to an explosion in numbers, a vast increase in range in that state, impacts on agricultural production, increased environmental damage, and a dramatic increase in vehicle accidents involving deer. This policy has since been reversed on privately held land only, and on such land the deer is once again only classified as a feral pest species; they remain game animals on public land. The NSW government now asks the public to assist by &quot;not&quot; transporting or releasing feral deer onto any land, implying that intentional release of deer has been a factor in the vast increase in range in NSW in recent years.

====Argentina====
The European fallow deer was introduced to Victoria Island in Neuquén Province by billionaire Aaron Anchorena, who intended to increase hunting opportunities. He freed wildlife of European and Asian origin, making them common inhabitants of the island.

==== Canada ====
The European fallow deer is listed as an invasive species in the province of British Columbia. In 2021, the Canadian federal government, local First Nations, and local residents put forward a plan to eradicate the fallow deer population on Sidney Island, a small island located off the southwest coast of British Columbia.

====Great Britain and Ireland====

The European fallow deer was spread across Central Europe by the Romans. Recent finds at Fishbourne Roman Palace show that European fallow deer were introduced into southern England in the first century AD. Fallow deer were established in Britain by the fourth century AD. Genetic studies have shown that this population became extinct and the fallow deer was re-introduced from Anatolia prior to the Norman conquest, not introduced from Scilly by the Normans as had previously been believed. Deer from England are a likely source of their re-introduction elsewhere in northern Europe.

European fallow deer are now widespread on the UK mainland and are present in most of England and Wales south of a line drawn from the Wash to the Mersey. Populations in the New Forest and the Forest of Dean are long-standing, and many of the other populations originated from park escapees. They are not quite so widespread in the northern parts of England, but are present in most lowland areas and also in parts of Scotland, principally in Strathtay and around Loch Lomond. According to the British Deer Society distribution survey 2007, they have increased in range since the previous survey in 2000, although the increase in range is not as spectacular as for some of the other deer species.

A significant number of the European fallow deer in the Forest of Dean and in Epping Forest are of the black variety. One particularly interesting population, known as &quot;long-haired fallow deer&quot;, inhabit Mortimer Forest on the England/Wales border; a significant part of the population has long body hair with distinct ear tufts.

A historical herd is at Phoenix Park in Ireland, where a herd of 400–450 European fallow deer descends from the original herd introduced in the 1660s. In a 2023 study, this herd was shown to comprise the first wild deer outside of North America to have contracted SARS-CoV-2, raising concerns about a potential natural reservoir arising within European deer herds.

====New Zealand====
From 1860, European fallow deer were introduced into New Zealand. Significant herds exist in a number of low-altitude forests.

====South Africa====
European fallow deer are popular in the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal for hunting purposes, in parts of the Gauteng Province to beautify ranches, and in the Eastern Cape where they were introduced on game farms for the hunting industry because of their exotic qualities. European fallow deer adapted extremely well to the South African environment with access to savanna grasslands, particularly in the cooler climate ranges such as the highveld. They also occur in the western cape.

====Sweden====
One noted historical herd of European fallow deer is located in the Ottenby nature reserve in Öland, where Charles X Gustav of Sweden erected a dry stone wall some 4 km long to enclose a royal fallow deer herd in the mid-17th century; the herd still exists as of 2006.

====United States====
In recent times, European fallow deer have been introduced in parts of the United States. A small feral population exists on one barrier island in Georgia. Fallow deer have also been introduced in Texas, along with many other exotic deer species, where they are often hunted on large game ranches.

In Pennsylvania, European fallow deer are considered livestock, since no feral animals are breeding in the wild. Occasional reports of wild European fallow deer in Pennsylvania and Indiana are generally attributed to escapes from preserves or farms.

A herd of white European fallow deer is located near Argonne National Laboratories in northeastern Illinois.
A small herd of 15 mostly white European fallow deer resides at the Belle Isle Nature Zoo on Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan. Until the turn of the 21st century, this herd had the run of the island; the herd was thereafter confined, with extirpation being the initial goal.

A small herd, believed to be the oldest in the United States, exists in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) in far western Kentucky and Tennessee. The European fallow deer herd in the LBL &quot;was brought to LBL by the Hillman Land Company in 1918. LBL&#x27;s herd is believed to be the oldest population of fallow deer in the country, and at one time was the largest. Today, the herd numbers fewer than 150 and hunting of fallow deer is not permitted. Although LBL&#x27;s wildlife management activities focus on native species, the fallow herd is maintained for wildlife viewing and because of its historical significance.&quot;

European fallow deer are present in the Point Reyes National Seashore, California, and Mendocino County near Ridgewood Ranch, west of Redwood Valley, California; some of them are leucistic.

== Mating system ==
European fallow deer are highly dimorphic, polygynous breeders; the breeding season or rut lasts about 135 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the breeding season tends to occur in the second half of October, while it occurs in April in the Southern Hemisphere, some matings can still occur before and after. This mating behaviour within the rut most often occurs in leks, where males congregate in small groups on mating territories in which the females’ only purpose for visiting these territories is for copulation. Variation within European fallow deer mating systems occurs; other than the traditional behaviour of lekking, different types of mating behaviours can include harems, dominance groups, stands, temporary stands, and multiple stands. Different populations, environmental variation, size, and even age can determine the type of variation within a European fallow deer mating system, but lekking behaviour is the most commonly found and studied in nature; variation can be explained by three characteristics (1) the optimal strategy under specific environmental or social conditions, (2) the strategy of an individual may be dependent on the strategies of other individual males within the same population, and (3) individual males may be less capable at gaining access to females, since they can be outcompeted by other males that are more capable.

Female European fallow deer are polyestrous; they are receptive to males during multiple periods of estrus throughout the mating season while not gestating. Male rut behaviour includes licking and sniffing around the anus and vulva to determine whether a female is fertile. Males produce high-pitched whines repeatedly to initiate mating; following this display, a female may allow the male to mount; copulation can last as long as 5 minutes.

=== Ecology and mating system characteristics ===
Many deer species—including European fallow deer—have a social organization that can be tremendously plastic depending on their environment, meaning that group size and habitat type are closely linked to herd size. Most of the detailed research on the ecological characteristics and behaviour of European fallow deer occurs in large blocks of woodland, which means some bias may be present. European fallow deer can be found in a variety of habitats, which can range from cool and wet to hot and dry. European fallow deer seem to have a preference for older forests with dispersed areas of grass, trees, and a variety of other vegetation. The largest herd occurs right before the rutting season, while the smallest groups are females with fawns. Throughout a large portion of the year, the sexes remain separated and only congregate during the mating months, but other patterns may be described, such as bachelor groups and even mixed groups.

Male European fallow deer produce low-frequency vocalizations called groans; the sound of these groans results from the consistent and complex shape of the vocal tract involving the oral and nasal cavities.

Ruts are characterized by males gaining the best territory possible to increase their odds for mating, and are often characterized by the presence of females on stands. During this time, males stop feeding to defend their ruts from subordinate males. Males defending this territory often lose an average of 17% of their body weight, and the liver exhibits steatosis, which is reversible. Throughout breeding seasons, the males may obtain the same rut; in some cases, ruts can be held by more than one individual; some possibilities for this include high population density and less rut space, or more suitable habitats, which can be shared.

=== Parental care ===
After a female is impregnated, gestation lasts up to 245 days. Usually one fawn is born; twins are rare. The females can conceive when they are 16 months old, whereas the males can successfully breed at 16 months, but most do not breed until they are 48 months old. The females can become very cagey just before they give birth to their fawn and find secluded areas such as a bush or cave; sometimes females give birth near the herd. As soon as the female gives birth, the she then licks the fawn to clean it; this helps initiate the maternal bond between the two, and only females provide parental investment; males do not participate in rearing the fawn.

After the birth of the fawn occurs, the females do not return to the herd for at least 10 days and for most of the days the mother is separated from the fawn, returning only to feed the fawn. The nursing period lasts about 4 months and happens every 4 hours each day. Rumination is a critical part of development in the fawn&#x27;s life, and this develops about 2 to 3 weeks into the fawn&#x27;s life. Females initiate the weaning periods for the fawn, which lasts about 20 days; 3 to 4 weeks; later, the fawn will start to follow its mother, and they will finally rejoin the herd together. The mother frequently licks the fawn&#x27;s anal area to stimulate suckling, urination, and defecation, which is a critical part of the development of the fawn. Weaning is completed at around 7 months, and at around 12 months, the fawn is independent; after the 135 days of reproduction, the rut comes to an end, which can be characterized by the changes in group size and behaviour.

=== Contests and weaponry ===
Since European fallow deer are polygynous species that congregate once every year, males must fight to obtain access to estrous females. The relationship between antler size and body condition can be treated as indicators to reflect body condition within a given year. These secondary sexual characteristics can have dual functions, which include the attractiveness of males, which females can ultimately choose, and fighting ability of the male. It was found that males with larger antlers had higher mating success, where males with asymmetrical antlers did not. When males develop their antlers, trade-offs are made between reproduction and survival. Genetic variations exist within fallow deer populations with variable antler growth, males that exhibited faster-growing antlers early in life are able to grow longer antlers without any significant cost; this shows that there is phenotypic variation among fallow deer populations.

Aggressive behaviour is often observed when individuals are seeking out mates, scarce resources, and even territories. Species that compete using their weapons usually engage with mutual agreement, but if any noticeable asymmetries are seen, such as a broken or lost weapon, this may alter the behaviour of an individual to engage in a fight. Likelihood and severity of antler damage were looked at in fallow deer, to test whether antler damage was associated with contest tactics and duration, and if an association existed with the tendency for individuals to engage in fighting. Individuals with undamaged antlers were more likely to attack, using high-risk tactics that included jumping, clashing, or backward-pushing behaviour, this was exhibited by both contestants; dominant males were more likely to have damaged antlers. Dominance ranks exist within fallow deer populations, which can be linked to aggression level and body size; when competing for a male, however, how ranks are obtained is not studied extensively.

=== Endurance rivalry ===
Male fallow deer are highly competitive during the rutting season; successful mating depends mainly on body size and dominance rank. Many factors can determine the seasonal reproductive success of an individual male fallow deer; these factors include body size, which can affect reproduction and survival. The amount of time spent in a lek can be an important factor in determining male reproductive success; energy can play an important role for the duration of competitive leks. Among ungulates, European fallow deer exhibit one of the most outstanding examples of sexual dimorphism, as males are much larger than females. For sexual selection to lead to the evolution of sexual dimorphism, where males are bigger than females, advantages must be present: (1) Advantages during combat, (2) Endurance rivalry advantage, (3) Female preference for larger males, and (4) Advantages during sperm competition. Sexual selection has chosen bigger males over an evolutionary time scale and conferred advantages during competition of mates by a variety of mechanisms, which are intrasexual competition, access to females, and resource accessibility, which affects attractiveness to females.

Body size is important during male-male agonistic interactions and endurance rivalry, while females tend to have a preference for larger males. Dominance rank is a good indicator of body size and body mass, but age was not an important factor. In a study done by McElligott et al. (2001), it was found that mating success was related to body size, pre-rut and rut rank. Similarly, in another study, researchers found that age, weight, and display effort were all significant factors in determining mating success; in both studies, mating success was measured by the frequency of copulations, which means that a variety of factors in different fallow deer populations can affect the overall energy allocation which will ultimately affect mating success. Maternal investment early in life can be critical to the development of body size, since it can be quite variable at that stage depending on resources and habitat type. Mature male body size can be a better indicator of overall male quality rather than body mass, since body mass depends on a variety of resources each year and is not a static trait; body mass can be a complex trait to measure.

== Threats ==
Since the 20th century, a serious decline in the populations of European fallow deer has been seen in Turkey, the only region where it is definitely thought to be native, and it has disappeared from almost all regions where it was formerly found aside from Düzlerçami Game Reserve in the Mount Güllük-Termessos National Park, where a semiwild, genetically distinct population exists. The Turkish government undertook a breeding program at Düzlerçami starting in 1966, with the population growing from 7 to 500 animals, but it underwent a massive collapse until 2000 due to reasons not fully understood, but thought to be linked to urbanization, recreational activities, and poaching, and numbered less than 30 (with only 10 individuals roaming outside the fenced areas) individuals by 2007 and less than 130 individuals by 2010. This population remains at risk from inbreeding and poaching. Reintroduction to other areas of Turkey has not been successful but should still be considered to increase the species&#x27; population.

The population on Rhodes, which is of uncertain origin, but is known to be very genetically distinct from others, is also of major conservation concern. It numbers around 400-500 animals and is at risk from poaching and wildfires. The population is also at risk of outbreeding depression, as in some parts of Rhodes, mainland European fallow deer are kept in fenced areas; these deer could escape and breed with the Rhodian fallow deer. Rhodian fallow deer also damage summer crops and due to a lack of a compensation system, persecution against the population could happen. A reduction of water resources on the island due to climate change could also affect the animals. Despite this, there are signs of population recovery on Rhodes as of 2008 due to conservation measures.

Despite these threats, the European fallow deer is common across the other areas where it could potentially be native, as well as the areas throughout Europe that it was introduced to early on, thus it is considered to be of least concern by the IUCN Red List.

<text>Herbert Paul Grice (13 March 1913 – 28 August 1988), usually publishing under the name H. P. Grice, H. Paul Grice, or Paul Grice, was a British philosopher of language who created the theory of implicature and the cooperative principle (with its namesake Gricean maxims), which became foundational concepts in the linguistic field of pragmatics. His work on meaning has also influenced the philosophical study of semantics.

==Life==
Born and raised in Harborne (now a suburb of Birmingham), in the United Kingdom, he was educated at Clifton College and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After a brief period teaching at Rossall School, he went back to Oxford, firstly as a graduate student at Merton College from 1936 to 1938, and then as a Lecturer, Fellow and Tutor from 1938 at St John&#x27;s College. During the Second World War Grice served in the Royal Navy; after the war he returned to his Fellowship at St John&#x27;s, which he held until 1967. In that year, he moved to the United States to take up a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until his death in 1988. He returned to the UK in 1979 to give the John Locke lectures on &quot;Aspects of Reason&quot;. He reprinted many of his essays and papers in his valedictory book, &quot;Studies in the Way of Words&quot; (1989).

Grice married Kathleen Watson in 1942; they had two children.

==Grice on meaning==
One of Grice&#x27;s two most influential contributions to the study of language and communication is his theory of meaning, which he began to develop in his article &quot;Meaning&quot;, written in 1948 but published only in 1957 at the prodding of his colleague, P. F. Strawson. Grice further developed his theory of meaning in the fifth and sixth of his William James lectures on &quot;Logic and Conversation&quot;, delivered at Harvard in 1967. These two lectures were initially published as &quot;Utterer&#x27;s Meaning and Intentions&quot; in 1969 and &quot;Utterer&#x27;s Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning&quot; in 1968, and were later collected with the other lectures as the first section of &quot;Studies in the Way of Words&quot; in 1989.

===Natural vs. non-natural meaning===
In the 1957 article &quot;Meaning&quot;, Grice describes &quot;natural meaning&quot; using the example of &quot;Those spots mean (meant) measles.&quot;

And describes &quot;non-natural meaning&quot; using the example of &quot;John means that he&#x27;ll be late&quot; or &quot;&#x27;Schnee&#x27; means &#x27;snow&#x27;&quot;.

Grice does not define these two senses of the verb &#x27;to mean&#x27;, and does not offer an explicit theory that separates the ideas they&#x27;re used to express. Instead, he relies on five differences in ordinary language usage to show that we use the word in (at least) two different ways.

===Intention-based semantics===
For the rest of &quot;Meaning&quot;, and in his discussions of meaning in &quot;Logic and Conversation&quot;, Grice deals exclusively with non-natural meaning. His overall approach to the study of non-natural meaning later came to be called &quot;intention-based semantics&quot; because it attempts to explain non-natural meaning based on the idea of speakers&#x27; intentions. To do this, Grice distinguishes two kinds of non-natural meaning:

Utterer&#x27;s meaning: What a speaker means by an utterance. (Grice didn&#x27;t introduce this label until &quot;Logic and Conversation.&quot; The more common label in contemporary work is &quot;speaker meaning&quot;, though Grice didn&#x27;t use that term.)

Timeless meaning: The kind of meaning that can be possessed by a type of utterance such as a word or a sentence (rather than by an individual speaker). (This is often called &quot;conventional meaning&quot;, although Grice didn&#x27;t call it that.)

The two steps in intention-based semantics are (1) to define utterer&#x27;s meaning in terms of speakers&#x27; overt audience-directed intentions, and then (2) to define timeless meaning in terms of utterer&#x27;s meaning. The net effect is to define all linguistic notions of meaning in purely mental terms, and to thus shed psychological light on the semantic realm.

Grice tries to accomplish the first step by means of the following definition:

&quot;A meantNN something by x&quot; is roughly equivalent to &quot;A uttered x with the intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this intention&quot;.

(In this definition, &#x27;A&#x27; is a variable ranging over speakers and &#x27;x&#x27; is a variable ranging over utterances.) Grice generalises this definition of speaker meaning later in &#x27;Meaning&#x27; so that it applies to commands and questions, which, he argues, differ from assertions in that the speaker intends to induce an intention rather than a belief. Grice&#x27;s initial definition was controversial, and seemingly gives rise to a variety of counterexamples, and so later adherents of intention-based semantics—including Grice himself, Stephen Schiffer, Jonathan Bennett, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson, and Stephen Neale—have attempted to improve on it in various ways while keeping the basic idea intact.

Grice next turns to the second step in his program: explaining the notion of timeless meaning in terms of the notion of utterer&#x27;s meaning. He does so very tentatively with the following definition:

&quot;x meansNN (timeless) that so-and-so&quot; might as a first shot be equated with some statement or disjunction of statements about what &quot;people&quot; (vague) intend (with qualifications about &quot;recognition&quot;) to effect by x.

The basic idea here is that the meaning of a word or sentence results from a regularity in what speakers use the word or sentence to mean. Grice would give a much more detailed theory of timeless meaning in his sixth Logic and Conversation lecture. A more influential attempt to expand on this component of intention-based semantics has been given by Stephen Schiffer.

==Grice&#x27;s theory of implicature==

Grice&#x27;s most influential contribution to philosophy and linguistics is his theory of implicature, which started in his 1961 article, &quot;The Causal Theory of Perception&quot;, and &quot;Logic and Conversation&quot;, which was delivered at Harvard&#x27;s &#x27;William James Lectures&#x27; in 1967, and published in 1975 as a chapter in volume 3 of &quot;Syntax and Semantics: Speech Acts&quot;.

===Saying/implicating distinction===
According to Grice, what a speaker means by an utterance can be divided into what the speaker &quot;says&quot; and what the speaker thereby &quot;implicates&quot;.

Grice makes it clear that the notion of saying he has in mind, though related to a colloquial sense of the word, is somewhat technical, referring to it as &quot;a favored notion of &#x27;saying&#x27; that must be further elucidated&quot;. Nonetheless, Grice never settled on a full elucidation or definition of his favoured notion of saying, and the interpretation of this notion has become a contentious issue in the philosophy of language.

One point of controversy surrounding Grice&#x27;s favoured notion of saying is the connection between it and his concept of utterer&#x27;s meaning. Grice makes it clear that he takes saying to be a kind of meaning, in the sense that doing the former entails doing the latter: &quot;I want to say that (1) &quot;U (utterer) said that p&quot; entails (2) &quot;U did something x by which U meant that p&quot; (87). This condition is controversial, but Grice argues that apparent counterexamples—cases in which a speaker apparently says something without meaning it—are actually examples of what he calls &quot;making as if to say&quot;, which can be thought of as a kind of &quot;mock saying&quot; or &quot;play saying&quot;.

Another point of controversy surrounding Grice&#x27;s notion of saying is the relationship between what a speaker says with an expression and the expression&#x27;s timeless meaning. Although he attempts to spell out the connection in detail several times, the most precise statement that he endorses is the following one:

In the sense in which I am using the word say, I intend what someone has said to be closely related to the conventional meaning of the words (the sentence) he has uttered.

Grice never spelled out what he meant by the phrase &quot;closely related&quot; in this passage, and philosophers of language continue to debate over its best interpretation.

In &#x27;The Causal Theory of Perception&#x27;, Grice contrasts saying (which he there also calls &quot;stating&quot;) with &quot;implying&quot;, but in Logic and Conversation he introduces the technical term &quot;implicature&quot; and its cognates &quot;to implicate&quot; and &quot;implicatum&quot; (i.e., that which is implicated). Grice justifies this neologism by saying that &quot;&#x27;Implicature&#x27; is a blanket word to avoid having to make choices between words like &#x27;imply&#x27;, &#x27;suggest&#x27;, &#x27;indicate&#x27;, and &#x27;mean&#x27;&quot;.

Grice sums up these notions by suggesting that to implicate is to perform a &quot;non-central&quot; speech act, whereas to say is to perform a &quot;central&quot; speech act. As others have more commonly put the same distinction, saying is a kind of &quot;direct&quot; speech act whereas implicating is an &quot;indirect&quot; speech act. This latter way of drawing the distinction is an important part of John Searle&#x27;s influential theory of speech acts.

===Conventional vs. conversational implicature===
Although Grice is best known for his theory of conversational implicature, he also introduced the notion of conventional implicature. The difference between the two lies in the fact that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is tied in some way to the timeless meaning of part of the sentence, whereas what a speaker conversationally implicates is not directly connected with timeless meaning. Grice&#x27;s best-known example of conventional implicature involves the word &#x27;but&#x27;, which, he argues, differs in meaning from the word &#x27;and&#x27; only in that we typically conventionally implicate something over and above what we say with the former but not with the latter. In uttering the sentence &#x27;She was poor but she was honest&#x27;, for example, we say merely that she was poor and she was honest, but we implicate that poverty contrasts with honesty (or that her poverty contrasts with her honesty).

Grice makes it clear that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is part of what the speaker means in uttering it, and that it is also closely connected to what the sentence means. Nonetheless, what a speaker conventionally implicates is not a part of what the speaker says.

U&#x27;s doing &quot;x&quot; might be his uttering the sentence &quot;She was poor but she was honest&quot;. What &quot;U&quot; meant, and what the sentence means, will both contain something contributed by the word &quot;but&quot;, and I do not want this contribution to appear in an account of what (in my favored sense) &quot;U&quot; said (but rather as a conventional implicature).

Grice did not elaborate much on the notion of conventional implicature, but many other authors have tried to give more extensive theories of it, including Lauri Karttunen and Stanley Peters, Kent Bach, Stephen Neale, and Christopher Potts.

===Conversational implicature===
To conversationally implicate something in speaking, according to Grice, is to mean something that goes beyond what one says in such a way that it must be inferred from non-linguistic features of a conversational situation together with general principles of communication and co-operation.

The general principles Grice proposed are what he called the Cooperative principle and the Maxims of Conversation. According to Grice, the cooperative principle is a norm governing all cooperative interactions among humans.

Cooperative Principle: &quot;Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.&quot; (Grice 1989: 26).

The conversational maxims can be thought of as precisifications of the cooperative principle that deal specifically with communication.

Maxim of Quantity: Information
* Make your contribution as informative as is required for the current purposes of the exchange.
* Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

Maxim of Quality: Truth (supermaxim: &quot;Try to make your contribution one that is true&quot;)
* Do not say what you believe to be false.
* Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

Maxim of Relation: Relevance
* Be relevant.

Maxim of Manner: Clarity (supermaxim: &quot;Be perspicuous&quot;)
* Avoid obscurity of expression.
* Avoid ambiguity.
* Be brief (avoid prolixity).
* Be orderly.

Grice follows his summary of the maxims by suggesting that &quot;one might need others&quot; (i.e. the list is not necessarily exhaustive), and goes on to say that &quot;There are, of course, all sorts of other maxims (aesthetic, social, or moral in character), such as &quot;Be polite&quot;, that are also normally observed by participants in exchanges, and these may also generate nonconventional implicatures.&quot;

Conversational implicatures are made possible, according to Grice, by the fact that the participants in a conversation always assume each other to behave according to the maxims. So, when a speaker appears to have violated a maxim by saying or making as if to say something that is false, uninformative or too informative, irrelevant, or unclear, the assumption that the speaker is in fact obeying the maxims causes the interpreter to infer a hypothesis about what the speaker really meant. That an interpreter will reliably make such inferences allows speakers to intentionally &quot;flout&quot; the maxims—i.e., create the appearance of breaking the maxims in a way that is obvious to both speaker and interpreter—to get their implicatures across.

Perhaps Grice&#x27;s best-known example of conversational implicature is the case of the reference letter, a &quot;quantity implicature&quot; (i.e., because it involves flouting the first maxim of Quantity):

A is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: &quot;Dear Sir, Mr. X&#x27;s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc.&quot; (Gloss: A cannot be opting out, since if he wished to be uncooperative, why write at all? He cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the man is his pupil; moreover, he knows that more information than this is wanted. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information that he is reluctant to write down. This supposition is tenable only if he thinks Mr. X is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is implicating.) 

Given that a speaker means a given proposition &quot;p&quot; by a given utterance, Grice suggests several features which &quot;p&quot; must possess to count as a conversational implicature.

Nondetachability: &quot;The implicature is nondetachable insofar as it is not possible to find another way of saying the same thing (or approximately the same thing) which simply lacks the implicature.&quot;

Cancelability: &quot;...a putative conversational implicature is explicitly cancelable if, to the form of words the utterance of which putatively implicates that &quot;p&quot;, it is admissible to add &quot;but not p&quot;, or &quot;I do not mean to imply that p&quot;, and it is contextually cancelable if one can find situations in which the utterance of the form of words would simply not carry the implicature.&quot;

Non-Conventionality: &quot;...conversational implicata are not part of the meaning of the expressions to the employment of which they attach.&quot;

Calculability: &quot;The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out; for even if it can in fact be intuitively grasped, unless the intuition is replaceable by an argument, the implicature (if present at all) will not count as a conversational implicature; it will be a conventional implicature.&quot;

===Generalised vs. particularised conversational implicature===
Grice also distinguishes between generalised and particularised conversational implicature. Grice says that particularised conversational implicatures (such as in the reference letter case quoted above) arise in &quot;cases in which an implicature is carried by saying that &quot;p&quot; on a particular occasion in virtue of special features about the context, cases in which there is no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is normally carried by saying that &quot;p&quot;.&quot; Generalized implicature, by contrast, arise in cases in which &quot;one can say that the use of a certain form of words in an utterance would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature.&quot; Grice does not offer a full theory of generalised conversational implicatures that distinguishes them from particularised conversational implicatures, on one hand, and from conventional implicatures, on the other hand, but later philosophers and linguists have attempted to expand on the idea of generalised conversational implicatures.

==Grice&#x27;s paradox==
In his book &quot;Studies in the Way of Words&quot; (1989), he presents what he calls Grice&#x27;s paradox. In it, he supposes that two chess players, Yog and Zog, play 100 games under the following conditions:

(1) Yog is white nine of ten times.&lt;br&gt;
(2) There are no draws.

And the results are:

(1) Yog, when white, won 80 of 90 games.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Yog, when black, won zero of ten games.

This implies that:

(i) 8/9 times, if Yog was white, Yog won.&lt;br&gt;
(ii) 1/2 of the time, if Yog lost, Yog was black. 
(iii) 9/10 that either Yog wasn&#x27;t white or he won.

From these statements, it might &quot;appear&quot; one could make these deductions by contraposition and conditional disjunction:

([a] from [ii]) If Yog was white, then 1/2 of the time Yog won.&lt;br&gt;
([b] from [iii]) 9/10 times, if Yog was white, then he won.

But both (a) and (b) are untrue—they contradict (i). In fact, (ii) and (iii) don&#x27;t provide enough information to use Bayesian reasoning to reach those conclusions. That might be clearer if (i)-(iii) had instead been stated like so:

(i) When Yog was white, Yog won 8/9 times. (No information is given about when Yog was black.)
(ii) When Yog lost, Yog was black 1/2 the time. (No information is given about when Yog won.)
(iii) 9/10 times, either Yog was black and won, Yog was black and lost, or Yog was white and won. (No information is provided on how the 9/10 is divided among those three situations.)

Grice&#x27;s paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.

==Criticisms==
Relevance theory of Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson builds on and also challenges Grice&#x27;s theory of meaning and his account of pragmatic inference. The theory argues that Grice&#x27;s four Maxims of Conversation can be reduced to (and are implied by) a single one: &quot;Be relevant&quot; (because every utterance conveys a presumption of its own optimal relevance).

<doc id="335572" wikidata="Q438874" url="?curid=335572" title="Tracey Thorn">
<text>Tracey Thorn (born 26 September 1962) is an English singer, songwriter, and author. She is best known as a member of the duo Everything but the Girl, active from 1982 to 2000, and again from 2022. She was in the band Marine Girls from 1980 to 1983. Since 2007 she has been active as a solo artist, and as a writer of books and essays.

==Early life==
The youngest of three children, Thorn was born in Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. She grew up in nearby Hatfield and studied English at the University of Hull, where she graduated in 1984 with First Class Honours. She later took an MA degree at Birkbeck, University of London.

==Music career==
===Stern Bops (1979–1980)===
Thorn began her musical career in the punk-pop hybrid group Stern Bops playing guitar and providing some vocal backing.

===Marine Girls (1980–1983)===

Thorn then formed Marine Girls as primary songwriter, playing guitar and sharing vocals. The band released two albums (&quot;Beach Party&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Lazy Ways&quot; in 1983) and three singles. The group disbanded in 1983.

===Everything but the Girl (1982–2000, 2023–)===
Thorn met Ben Watt at the University of Hull where they were both students, and both signed as solo artists to Cherry Red Records. Their first album together was &quot;Eden&quot;, released in 1984. Everything but the Girl released a body of work that spanned two decades. Their biggest chart success came in 1995, when DJ Todd Terry remixed a song from their &quot;Amplified Heart&quot; album. &quot;Missing&quot; peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart; topped the charts in Canada, Denmark, Germany, and Italy; and made the top ten in many countries, including Australia, France, Ireland, Sweden, and the United States.

Everything but the Girl was inactive from 2000 to 2022. During that time, Watt played on some filmed performances of Thorn&#x27;s solo work and on her 2011 recording of the xx&#x27;s &quot;Night Time&quot;.

In November 2022, Watt and Thorn announced on social media that they had recorded a new album as Everything but the Girl. The album, titled &quot;Fuse&quot;, was released in April 2023.

===Solo career and collaborations (1982–present)===
Thorn&#x27;s first solo work was a mini-album entitled &quot;A Distant Shore&quot; (1982). A re-recorded version of the track &quot;Plain Sailing&quot; was released as a single, and was included on the &quot;Pillows &amp; Prayers&quot; Cherry Red records compilation album.

In the 1980s, Thorn contributed guest vocals and backing vocals for The Style Council on the track &quot;The Paris Match&quot; (from the album &quot;Café Bleu&quot;), The Go-Betweens on their track &quot;Head Full of Steam&quot;, Working Week on the single &quot;Venceremos (We Will Win)&quot; and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions on the track &quot;Big Snake&quot;.

In the 1990s, she collaborated with Massive Attack on several projects, including the soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;Batman Forever&quot; where she contributed with &quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot;. Their first project together was the song &quot;Protection&quot; (for which she wrote the lyrics and melody) from the album by Massive Attack of the same name. She also co-wrote and sings on the track &quot;Better Things&quot;. She also sang &quot;The Tree Knows Everything&quot; on Adam F&#x27;s debut album &quot;Colours&quot; and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; on James McMillan&#x27;s 1993 Japan-only release &quot;Makin&#x27; Changes&quot;.

Just prior to her return to recording in 2007, Thorn contributed vocals to the song &quot;Damage&quot; by the band Tiefschwarz on the album &quot;Eat Books&quot;.

In March 2007, Thorn released her second solo album &quot;Out of the Woods&quot; on Virgin Records (Worldwide) and on Astralwerks (USA). It was produced by Ewan Pearson, who kept collaborating with her in subsequent releases. The first single from the album, &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, accompanied by remixes from the likes of Kris Menace &amp; Martin Buttrich, was released on 7 February and reached No. 75 on the UK singles chart while the album met critical acclaim and peaked at No. 38 on the Albums Chart.

In 2008, Thorn collaborated with the Hungarian acoustic downtempo group The Unbending Trees on their single &quot;Overture&quot;, which also featured on their album &quot;Chemically Happy (Is The New Sad)&quot;, released by her partner Ben Watt.

In 2009, Thorn collaborated with the Swedish singer-songwriter Jens Lekman for a cover of The Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;Yeah! Oh Yeah!&quot; for a compilation album commemorating twenty years of Merge Records, &quot;Score! 20 Years of Merge Records: The Covers!&quot;.

Thorn&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Love and Its Opposite&quot; was released in May 2010 on Ben Watt&#x27;s Strange Feeling Records in the UK, and on Merge Records in the US. Recorded in London and Berlin and produced by Ewan Pearson, it contained eight new songs and two cover versions, &quot;Come on Home to Me&quot; by Lee Hazlewood, and &quot;You Are a Lover&quot; by The Unbending Trees.

Thorn&#x27;s fourth solo album was a Christmas album entitled &quot;Tinsel and Lights&quot;. It was released in late October 2012, and included covers of songs by Carol Hall, The White Stripes, Ron Sexsmith, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, Sufjan Stevens, Low and Scritti Politti, plus two original songs and contributions from Green Gartside and Ben Watt. The original song &quot;Joy&quot; is featured in the 2012 film &quot;All Is Bright&quot; with Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd.

In 2013 Thorn wrote and recorded the original music for &quot;The Falling&quot;, the debut feature film by filmmaker Carol Morley, which premiered at the London Film Festival 2014.

In 2013 Thorn recorded two Molly Drake tracks for a documentary &quot;The Songs of Molly Drake&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Molly Drake is the mother of the singer/songwriter Nick Drake.

A compilation album, &quot;&quot;, was released in the UK on 23 October 2015. It has 34 tracks on two discs.

On 17 January 2018, Thorn announced the release of her album &quot;Record&quot;, which was released on 2 March. The album was produced by Ewan Pearson, and features contributions from Corinne Bailey Rae, Shura, Jona Ma and Stella and Jenny from Warpaint. Along with the announcement, Thorn released the debut single and video from the project, entitled &quot;Queen&quot;.

==Writing==
Virago published Thorn&#x27;s memoir &quot;Bedsit Disco Queen: How I Grew Up and Tried to Be a Pop Star&quot; early in 2013. It received widespread critical acclaim and was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Top Ten best-seller.

In 2014, she began a regular column (&#x27;Off the Record&#x27;) for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. The column ran until spring of 2022.

In 2015 Virago published her second book, &quot;Naked at the Albert Hall&quot;, about singers and singing.

She published a third memoir in 2019: &quot;Another Planet: A Teenager in Suburbia&quot; (2019).

2021 saw the publication of a fourth book, &quot;My Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Friend&quot;, focused on her friendship with Lindy Morrison of the Go-Betweens, and on the experiences of female musicians in the male-dominated music scene.

==Personal life==
After 28 years as a couple, Thorn and Ben Watt, the other half of Everything But The Girl, married in 2009 at Chelsea Register Office. They live in Hampstead, North London and have three children.

<doc id="335575" wikidata="Q3250421" url="?curid=335575" title="Breakfast sausage">
<text>Breakfast sausage (or country sausage) is a type of fresh sausage, typically made from pork, that is a common breakfast food in the United States. In the United States, the predominant flavorings used for seasoning are black pepper and sage. There are also varieties seasoned with maple syrup or cayenne pepper. Some breakfast sausage is flavored with cured bacon.

It is a common breakfast item in traditional American &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;country&quot; breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Scraps and trimmings were ground, seasoned and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal. 

It can be in the form of smoked or fresh patties, links or loose sausage. Most diners, fast-food restaurants, and family restaurants across the country will also carry one or more versions of it during breakfast hours, whether on a sandwich, in a breakfast platter, or both; some fine-dining establishments will also have a sausage option on their breakfast or brunch menu. The cased link variety is most similar to English-style sausages and has been produced in the United States since colonial days; it closely resembles Lincolnshire sausage. 

It is essentially a highly seasoned ground meat, so it does not keep and should be stored and handled appropriately. Newer variations made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry (turkey or chicken) can also be found. There are also vegetarian varieties that use textured vegetable protein (TVP) in place of meat.

Breakfast sausage is normally fried in a pan, grilled, or microwaved. Maple syrup is sometimes added onto breakfast sausages. Cooked breakfast sausage is also mixed into egg casseroles before baking. Crumbled sausage added to white gravy is the central component of sausage gravy.

==Brands==
Some common US brands include: Wampler&#x27;s, Bob Evans, Jimmy Dean, Owens Country Sausage, Swaggerty&#x27;s Farm, Purnell&#x27;s Old Folks Country Sausage, Tennessee Pride, Johnsonville, Farmland, P.G. Molinari &amp; Sons, Smithfield, and Jones.

<doc id="335576" wikidata="Q1026145" url="?curid=335576" title="Cala Gonone">
<text>Cala Gonone is an Italian seaside town and a civil parish (&quot;frazione&quot;) of the municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) of Dorgali, Province of Nuoro, in the region of Sardinia. In 2007 it had 1,279 inhabitants.

==History==
The area around Cala Gonone was inhabited in the Nuragic Era. The remains of a Nuragic settlement can be seen at Nuraghe Mannu on the outskirts of the village, just off the road to Dorgali. The modern village was founded by a colony of fishermen from the island of Ponza at the beginning of the 20th century. The town however remained largely isolated from the rest of Sardinia until the tunnel through the hills from Dorgali was opened in 1860.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the Bay of Orosei on the east of the island and in the geographical region of Supramonte, 9 kilometers from Dorgali, 41 from Nuoro and 108 from Olbia. Close to the village, and reachable by the sea, is the show cave of Bue Marino. Many boats from small speedboats to large tourist boats dock in at the Bue Marino or travel further down the coast to Cala Luna to let the passengers bath in the turquoise water or explore the caves that have been hollowed out by the sea. Almost everyone that goes to the small caves writes their name in charcoal, from a small fire, on the wall, creating a huge mass of writing across several meters of the cave wall.

Due to its natural environment (the territory is included in the Gennargentu National Park) and to the quality of its waters, Cala Gonone is a popular tourist venue. The beaches of the village are: the Spiaggia Centrale (central beach), S&#x27;Abba Durche, Cala Luna, Cartoe, Osalla, Cala Fuili, Sos Dorroles, S&#x27;Abba Meica, Ziu Martine and Cala Fuili.

<doc id="335577" wikidata="Q1650999" url="?curid=335577" title="Santa Maria Navarrese">
<text>Santa Maria Navarrese is a coastal and tourist town, frazione (&#x27;district&#x27;) of the municipality of Baunei, in the province of Nuoro, Sardinia. It is located at about 150 km north of Cagliari and 160 km south of Olbia, in the middle of the Gulf of Arbatax.

== History ==
Santa Maria Navarrese, founded in the 1950s by Baunese settlers, has grown around a medieval church dating back to , consecrated to Santa Maria Assunta. According to tradition, the church was built on behalf of a princess of Navarra, hence the adjective &quot;Navarrese&quot; in the village&#x27;s name. The place is known also for a 17th-century watchtower built on the beach and for the thousand-year-old oleasters in the main square.

== Geography and economy ==
Santa Maria Navarrese has a typical maquis shrubland seascape. Although it is part of the municipality of Baunei, it can be regarded as a separate town in some respects, mainly because Santa Maria Navarrese lies at 9,1 km (12 minutes by car) from Baunei and has a typical seaside landscape and an increasingly tourist economy, while Baunei is located inland and is mostly a mountainous town. Santa Maria Navarrese is also contiguous to the Tancau sul Mare frazione of Lotzorai and is part of a strip of Ogliastra&#x27;s coastal settlements that stretches southwards to Tortolì and Arbatax. It has a small, well-served tourist port, from which it is possible to reach the famous Sardinian : Cala Goloritzé, Cala Luna, Cala Mariolu (also called Ispùligi de Nie), Cala Sisine, Cala Biriala, Spiaggia dei Gabbiani and Grotta del Fico.

The town remains outside most commercial tourist routes and thus still offers a rural unspoiled landscape that provides an insight in day-to-day Sardinian life and is interesting for nature trail tourism. One trekking route that is focused on nature that starts from this city is Selvaggio Blu.</text><links>

<doc id="335583" wikidata="Q7817527" url="?curid=335583" title="Tom Sestak">
<text>Thomas Joseph Sestak (March 9, 1936 – April 3, 1987) was an American football defensive tackle who played for the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the McNeese State Cowboys. He was named to the AFL All-Time Team.

==Early life==
Sestak was born in Gonzales, Texas. He had mixed European heritage, with his grandparents on his father&#x27;s side being from Czechoslovakia while his grandparents on his mother&#x27;s side being from Poland. Alongside his two brothers, he played in numerous sports as a child, such as football and track. He played tight end in the collegiate ranks at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

==Career==
His talents led to him being drafted in the 17th round by the Buffalo Bills in 1962. He was also drafted by the Detroit Lions in the sixteenth round that year. He was an example of a trend of the young league to draft players from small colleges, which was deemed innovative in part due to its results that it cultivated, which Sestak represented well. He was to play defensive lineman for the Bills, owing to his 6-4 size, speed, and strength.

Sestak was a starter in his rookie year and, until a series of knee injuries ended his career after the 1967 season, used his strength to dominate the line of scrimmage. Sestak was a three-time selection to All-American Football League teams and a unanimous All-AFL defensive tackle in three consecutive years; 1963, 1964 and 1965. Sestak served as the cornerstone of a defense that took the Bills to the playoffs four straight years (1963–1966) and consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Over the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Sestak and his defense mates held opposing rushers without a touchdown for seventeen consecutive games, a Professional Football record that still stands. Twice during his outstanding career he realized the defensive lineman&#x27;s &quot;dream&quot;, returning interceptions for touchdowns, and once returned a recovered fumble for a score.

His teammates described his play as &quot;crazy as hell&quot;. He notably played a season with three broken ribs, and his knees problems meant that he spent time at a stationary bicycle instead of scrimmage during practice.

During the 1960s, only six professional defensive linemen were unanimous All-League selections for three or more years, Sestak (3), Bob Lily (5), Merlin Olsen (4), Willie Davis (3), Gino Marchetti (3), and Deacon Jones (3). The latter five, all former NFL players, have already been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Sestak, a star from the AFL, like many other AFL players has been ignored by the Hall of Fame selectors. He was named to the First Team for his position at defensive tackle, along with Houston Antwine. In contrast, Buck Buchanan (a Second Team selection) is a Hall of Famer while Sestak is not.

In January 1970, Sestak was selected as a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team, and in 2009 as a member of the Bills&#x27; 50th Anniversary Team. In 2007, Tom Sestak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Sestak to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 In 2019, despite not being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was chosen as a finalist for the NFL&#x27;s 100th Anniversary Team

Sestak died of a heart attack in 1987.

<doc id="335588" wikidata="Q917028" url="?curid=335588" title="Dining car">
<text>A dining car (American English) or a restaurant car (British English), also a [[diner]], is a passenger railroad car that serves meals in the manner of a full-service, sit-down restaurant.

These cars provide the highest level of service of any railroad food service car, typically employing multiple servers and kitchen staff members. Consequently, they are the most expensive to operate. It is distinct from other railroad food service cars that do not duplicate the full-service restaurant experience, such as buffet cars, cars in which one purchases food from a walk-up counter to be consumed either within the car or elsewhere in the train. Grill cars, in which customers sit on stools at a counter and purchase and consume food cooked on a grill behind the counter are generally considered to be an &quot;intermediate&quot; type of dining car.

==History==

===United States===
Before dining cars in passenger trains were common in the United States, a rail passenger&#x27;s option for meal service in transit was to patronize one of the roadhouses often located near the railroad&#x27;s &quot;water stops&quot;. Fare typically consisted of rancid meat, cold beans, and old coffee. Such poor conditions discouraged some from making the journey.

Most railroads began offering meal service on trains even before the First transcontinental railroad. By the mid-1880s, dedicated dining cars were a normal part of long-distance trains from Chicago to points west, save those of the Santa Fe Railway, which relied on America&#x27;s first interstate network of restaurants to feed passengers en route. The &quot;Harvey Houses&quot;, located strategically along the line, served top-quality meals to railroad patrons during water stops and other planned layovers and were favored over in-transit facilities for all trains operating west of Kansas City.

As competition among railroads intensified, dining car service was taken to new levels. When the Santa Fe unveiled its new Pleasure Dome lounge cars in 1951, the railroad introduced the travelling public to the Turquoise Room, promoted as &quot;The only private dining room in the world on rails.&quot; The room accommodated 12 guests, and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or cocktail parties, or other special functions. The room was often used by celebrities and dignitaries traveling on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.

Edwin Kachel was a steward for more than twenty-five years in the Dining-Car Department of the Great Northern Railway. He said that &quot;on a dining car, three elements can be considered -- the equipment, the employee, then passenger.&quot; In other words, &quot;the whole is constituted by two-thirds of human parts.&quot; As cross-country train travel became more commonplace, passengers began to expect high-quality food to be served at the meals on board. The level of meal service on trains in the 1920s and 1930s rivaled that of high-end restaurants and clubs.

===United Kingdom===
They were first introduced in England on 1 November 1879 by the Great Northern Railway Company on services between Leeds and London. A Pullman car was attached to the train for the purpose.

As of 2018, Great Western Railway is the only UK train company to provide a full dining Pullman service on selected trains to the West Country &amp; Wales.

==Food==
Elegance is one of the main words used to describe the concept of dining on a train. Use of fresh ingredients was encouraged whenever possible. Some of the dishes prepared by chefs were: Braised Duck Cumberland, Hungarian Beef Goulash with Potato Dumplings, Lobster Americaine, Mountain Trout Au Bleu, Curry of Lamb Madras, Scalloped Brussels Sprouts, Pecan and Orange Sticks and Pennepicure Pie to name a few items.

The Christmas menu for the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway in 1882 listed the following items: Hunter&#x27;s Soup, Salmon with Hollandaise Sauce, Boned Pheasant in Aspic Jelly, Chicken Salad, Salmis Prairie Chicken, Oyster Patties, Rice Croquette, Roast Beef, English Ribs of Beef, Turkey with Cranberry Sauce, Stuffed Suckling Pig with Applesauce, Antelope Steak with Currant Jelly, potatoes, green peas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, Mince Pie, Plum Pudding, Cake, ice cream, fruits and coffee.

==Configuration==

In one of the most common dining car configurations, one end of the car contains a galley (with an aisle next to it so that passengers can pass through the car to the rest of the train), and the other end has table or booth seating on either side of a center aisle.

Trains with high demand for dining car services sometimes feature &quot;double-unit dining cars&quot; consisting of two adjacent cars functioning to some extent as a single entity, generally with one car containing a galley as well as table or booth seating and the other car containing table or booth seating only.

In the dining cars of Amtrak&#x27;s modern bilevel &quot;Superliner&quot; trains, booth seating on either side of a center aisle occupies almost the entire upper level, with a galley below; food is sent to the upper level on a dumbwaiter.

Dining cars enhance the familiar restaurant experience with the unique visual entertainment of the ever-changing view. While dining cars are less common today than in the past (having been supplemented or in some cases replaced altogether by other types of food-service cars), they still play a significant role in passenger railroading, especially on medium- and long-distance trains.

Today, a number of tourist-oriented railroads offer dinner excursions to capitalize on the public&#x27;s fascination with the dining car experience.

The U76/U70 tram line between the German cities of Düsseldorf and Krefeld offers a &quot;Bistrowagen&quot; (&quot;dining car&quot; in German), where passengers can order drinks and snacks. That practice comes from the early 20th century, when interurban trams conveyed a dining car. Despite the introduction of modern tram units, four trams still have a &quot;Bistrowagen&quot; and operate every weekday.

<doc id="335590" wikidata="Q686623" url="?curid=335590" title="Nightwing">
<text>Nightwing is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The most prominent is [[Dick Grayson]], who takes the name when he leaves his role as Batman&#x27;s partner and sidekick Robin in his adulthood.

Although Nightwing is commonly associated with Batman, the title and concept have origins in classic Superman stories. The original Nightwing was an identity assumed by Superman when stranded on the Kryptonian city of Kandor with Jimmy Olsen. Drawing inspiration from Batman and Robin, the two protect Kandor as the superheroes Nightwing and Flamebird. Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; continuity reboots in 1985 and 1994, respectively, Nightwing was reimagined as a legendary vigilante from Krypton whose story inspires Dick Grayson&#x27;s choice of name when he leaves behind his Robin identity.

Other stories set among the &quot;Batman&quot; family of characters have seen acquaintances and friends of Grayson briefly assume the title, including his fellow Robin alumnus Jason Todd. Meanwhile, &quot;Superman&quot; stories have seen Superman&#x27;s adopted son Chris Kent and Power Girl take up the name for brief turns as Nightwing. Various other characters have taken the name in stories set outside DC&#x27;s main continuity as well.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis Era===

====Superman====

Nightwing is first depicted in the story &quot;Superman in Kandor&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; #158 (January 1963). It is an alias used by Superman in pre-Crisis stories. The story is set in Kandor, a Kryptonian city that was shrunken and preserved in a bottle by Brainiac. In Kandor, Superman has no superpowers, and is branded an outlaw there due to a misunderstanding.

To disguise themselves, Superman and Jimmy Olsen create vigilante identities inspired by Batman and Robin. Because neither bats nor robins lived on Krypton, Superman chooses the names of two birds owned by his Kandorian friend Nor-Kan: Nightwing for himself, and Flamebird for Jimmy. Nightwing and Flamebird rename Nor-Kan&#x27;s underground laboratory as the &quot;Nightcave&quot;, and use it as their secret headquarters. They also convert Nor-Kan&#x27;s automobile into their &quot;Nightmobile&quot;, and use &quot;jet-belts&quot; to fly into battle.

In &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot; #69 (June 1963), &quot;The Dynamic Duo of Kandor&quot; introduces Nightwing&#x27;s dog Nighthound. In &quot;The Feud Between Batman and Superman&quot; in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #143 (August 1964), Batman and Robin themselves visit Kandor with Superman and Olsen and the two Dynamic Duos team up.

====Van-Zee====
In &quot;Superman Family&quot; #183 (May/June 1977), Superman&#x27;s look-alike second cousin Van-Zee and his niece&#x27;s husband Ak-Var take up the Nightwing and Flamebird identities. The vigilantes take on crime in their city as had Superman and Olsen before them.

====Dick Grayson====

After Dick Grayson gives up his Robin mantle, he wonders for a while about his new role. When the Titans are threatened with a new foe, he takes on the mantle of Nightwing, in a homage to the Graysons, Batman, and Superman.

===Post-Crisis===

====Kryptonian mythological figure====
Post-Crisis, there is a different originator of the Nightwing identity. Several hundred years before the birth of Kal-El, there was a Kryptonian man who was cast out from his family and decided to take on crime as the vigilante Nightwing, whose crimefighting tactics were similar to Batman&#x27;s. When Superman tells Dick Grayson of this story, Dick takes the name for himself.

====Dick Grayson====
Dick Grayson became Nightwing after Batman fired him from his own mantle of Robin for getting shot by Joker. Grayson&#x27;s Flamebird was Bette Kane. After The New Teen Titans, Nightwing teamed up with old friend Speedy in Action Comics #613-618 &amp; #627-634 later collected in New Friends Old Enemies. He featured in his own solo &quot;Nightwing&quot; series from 1995 to 2009; after Wayne&#x27;s apparent death, Dick became the new Batman, retiring his Nightwing mantle temporarily.

Grayson&#x27;s Nightwing costume was a high-tech suit specially designed for his high-flying acrobatic style. His gauntlets and boots each contained eight compartments in which he could store items. They had a self-destruct feature built into them, similar to the ones in Batman&#x27;s utility belt, and, as another security measure, the suit contained a one-use-only taser charge, which automatically emitted a high-voltage electrical shock when someone attempted to tamper with either the boots or gauntlets.

Each gauntlet&#x27;s sections could contain a wide array of equipment, such as sonic or smoke pellets, modified batarangs (&quot;Wing-Dings&quot;), knockout gas capsules, throwable tracers, and a sedative-tipped dart launcher. The right gauntlet was also equipped with a 100,000-volt stun gun. Like the gauntlets, his boot compartments could carry vital equipment such as flares, a rebreather as protection against any airborne non-contact toxins, a mini-computer equipped with fax, modem, GPS, and a minidisk re-writable drive. Other items were lock picks, a first-aid kit, a mini-cellphone, flexi-cuffs, antitoxin assortment, wireless listening devices, and a small flashlight. After coming to New York, Dick added a black utility belt to his costume, eliminating the need for his boots and gauntlets.

Held in spring-loaded pouches in the back of his costume, Dick carried a pair of eskrima clubs made from an unbreakable polymer that were wielded as both offensive and defensive weapons. Some depictions display these tools with the mechanism to shoot a grappling hook attached to a swing line, while, in other instances, they can act as &quot;line guns&quot; similar to the ones Batman uses. The clubs could also be thrown with such skill by Grayson (and possibly due to their design) that they would ricochet off walls and objects to hit multiple targets, then return to his hands. These clubs also have the capability to be linked together as well as grow in size to make a staff, as depicted in many series, such as &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot; (Robin uses these weapons).

====Superman====
In 2001&#x27;s &quot;&quot; #111, Superman and Lois Lane travel to a version of Krypton later revealed to have been created by the villainous Brainiac 13 and based on Jor-El&#x27;s favorite period in Kryptonian history. Labeled as criminals, Superman and Lois become fugitives, adopting the Nightwing and Flamebird identities to survive, just as had Superman and Olsen in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #158.

====Tad Ryerstad====
In Blüdhaven, a sociopath named Tad Ryerstad becomes a superhero, inspired by the retired hero Tarantula. He takes his name, &quot;Nite-Wing&quot;, from an all-night deli specializing in chicken wings. Unstable, Nite-Wing beats people for minor offenses. Nite-Wing is shot on his first night out and Dick Grayson, as Blüdhaven&#x27;s protector Nightwing, defends him from Blockbuster&#x27;s gang, who think it is Nightwing who has been injured. After Nite-Wing is released from the hospital, he kills the gang who put him there. Not realizing how violent Ryerstad is, Grayson agrees to train him. The two attack Blockbuster&#x27;s organization, but are captured and separated. After an undercover FBI agent frees Nite-Wing, Ryerstad beats him to death, and when Grayson realizes what he has done, Ryerstad flees. Nightwing subsequently tracks down and has Nite-Wing arrested by the police. In prison, Ryerstad is cell-mates with Torque (Dudley Soames), but the two escape by drugging the prison guard Amygdala.

====Jason Todd====

&quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 2) #118-122 run features Jason Todd wearing Dick&#x27;s costume and killing in New York City which led to a police manhunt against Nightwing.

====Cheyenne Freemont====
The &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline features a metahuman fashion designer named Cheyenne Freemont donning a modified Nightwing costume to help Grayson.

Cheyenne first met Dick when they had a one-night stand together. They only exchanged first names the next morning, Cheyenne stating she&#x27;s superstitious. The two had breakfast together and then he left. When he left another man walked into her apartment. When he assaulted her, she hit him with a telekinetic blast.

Dick found out Cheyenne was a fashion designer from a friend of his from Blüdhaven. She ran into Dick again after he accidentally became a model for her. After seeing newspaper clippings of Nightwing (Jason Todd) she started creating superhero themed designs. Cheyenne wore a Nightwing costume to help Dick and Jason from a metahuman monster named Jakob. He ate her, but she used her powers to blow him up from the inside. Due to recent events she was left broke and soon left New York City.

====Power Girl====
In &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #6 (April 2006), Power Girl and Supergirl assume the identities of Nightwing and Flamebird in a story set in Kandor, just as in the original pre-Crisis stories featuring Superman.

====Chris Kent====
Chris Kent, son of General Zod, was Nightwing during &quot;&quot;. In that storyline, Superman was coming to terms with the death of his adoptive father; he was also dealing with 100,000 Kryptonians now living on Earth, which he had released from the bottled cities on Brainiac&#x27;s ship (the same ship that contained the lost Kryptonian city of Kandor). At the end of the fourth issue of the arc, a new Nightwing and Flamebird appear in Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude to stop two of Zod&#x27;s followers (who were living in Kandor) from releasing the Kryptonian General from his Phantom Zone imprisonment. While guarding the projector to prevent any Zod loyalists from freeing him from the Phantom Zone, both Flamebird and Nightwing exhibit powers that are not inherent to normal Kryptonians. Flamebird projects flames from her hands, and Nightwing uses &quot;natural tactile telekinesis&quot;.

The pair seems to be stronger than normal Kryptonians: they knock out the two Zod loyalists with one blow apiece. In a later appearance, the duo is seen in Gotham City. Unlike previous portrayals, it seems Flamebird believes herself to be the dominant partner. When the Kryptonians led by Zod and Alura flee to a new Krypton orbiting the Sun, Nightwing and Flamebird stay in Gotham. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #875, that Nightwing is revealed as the son of Zod and Ursa, Chris Kent. The &quot;Nightwing&quot; identity is revealed to be based on a mythical Kryptonian creature, whose existence is intertwined with that of its partner beast, the Flamebird. Inside the Phantom Zone Chris&#x27; mind interfaced with a piece of Brainiac technology, awakening a long-dormant connection to the Nightwing, and linking his mind to that of Thara Ak-Var, who had a connection to the Flamebird.

====Bruce Wayne====
Following the events of &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol.4) #114-116 Bruce adopts the suit and name while Dick Grayson has left Blüdhaven to cure his fear of heights. Bruce does this under the belief that &quot;Blüdhaven has lost too much. It needs a hero. Blüdhaven needs Nightwing.&quot;

==Alternative versions==
* Terry McGinnis briefly moonlights as Nightwing in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; #4, after Detective Ben Singleton claims to know Dick Grayson&#x27;s past as Nightwing, which turns into a media fiasco.

==Other uses in DC comics==
* In the DC Comics Tangent Comics series, &quot;Nightwing&quot; is a secret government organization which appears throughout the series. Headed by Marcus Moore and Francis &quot;Black Lightning&quot; Powell, who act to protect the US and also conceal the true nature of The Atom&#x27;s involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Ongoing series==
===Story arcs===

Based on Nightwing&#x27;s increasing popularity, DC Comics decided to test the character&#x27;s possibilities with a one-shot book and then a miniseries.

First, in &quot;Nightwing: Alfred&#x27;s Return&quot; #1 (1995), Grayson travels to England to find Alfred, who resigns from Bruce Wayne&#x27;s service following the events of &quot;KnightSaga&quot;. Before returning to Gotham City together, they prevent a plot by British terrorists to destroy the undersea &quot;Channel Tunnel&quot; in the English Channel. Later on, with the &quot;Nightwing&quot; miniseries (September 1995 to December 1995, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil with Greg Land as artist), Dick briefly considers retiring from being Nightwing forever before family papers uncovered by Alfred reveal a possible link between the murder of the Flying Graysons and the Crown Prince of Kravia. Journeying to Kravia, Nightwing (in his third costume) helps to topple the murderous Kravian leader and prevent an ethnic cleansing, while learning his parents&#x27; true connection to the Prince.

&quot;A Knight in Blüdhaven&quot;

In 1996, following the success of the miniseries, DC Comics launched &quot;Nightwing&quot;, the hero&#x27;s first ongoing monthly series (the first 70 issues of which are written by Chuck Dixon, with art by Scott McDaniel through the first 40 issues), in which he patrols Gotham&#x27;s neighboring city, Blüdhaven. During Dixon&#x27;s tenure, Dick gains a cast of supporting characters and villains. His primary villain quickly becomes the crime lord Blockbuster. For some time, Dick also becomes an officer of Blüdhaven Police Department. After leaving the series with the 70th issue, Devin Grayson took on the role of author for the series. Many plot lines established by Dixon were continued by Devin Grayson in the proceeding 30 issues. Devin Grayson&#x27;s run is also notable due to its controversial depiction of sexual assault in &quot;Nightwing&quot; &quot;#93.&quot; She would write until issue 100 where a vast majority of Dixon&#x27;s plotlines had been tied up. Her run would then take a brief break for Dixon and McDaniel&#x27;s return with &quot;Nightwing Year One&quot; (&quot;Nightwing #101-106&quot;). Devin Grayson then returned to the book to write the &quot;Mobbed Up&quot; plotline that involves Dick going undercover to take down a New York mafia family.

====&quot;Graduation Day&quot;====
For several years, Nightwing leads various incarnations of the Titans and becomes the most respected former sidekick in the DC Universe. However, in the &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot; crossover, a rogue Superman android kills Lilith and Troia, an event that tears apart both Young Justice and the Titans. At Troia&#x27;s funeral, Dick declares he is tired of seeing friends die and disbands the team, officially ending the Titans. A few months later, Arsenal persuades Nightwing to join a new pro-active crime-fighting team: the Outsiders, who would hunt villains, acting as co-workers rather than an extended family. He reluctantly accepts.

====&quot;One Year Later&quot;====

One year later, Dick Grayson returns to New York City to find out who has been masquerading as Nightwing. The murderous impostor turns out to be the former Robin, Jason Todd. Grayson leads the Outsiders once again, operating undercover and globally.

Nightwing follows an armored thief named Raptor, whom he suspects is responsible for series of murders. Later, Raptor himself is murdered in a manner similar to the other victims by an unseen contract killer, who proceeds to bury Grayson alive. Nightwing frees himself, wondering the relation between his experience and a mysterious voice who tells him that he is &quot;supposed to be dead&quot;. Nightwing is having trouble finding things to keep him busy during the day due to the cast on his right arm. Incapacitated from his injuries, he tries without luck to find jobs and continues to research into the mysterious assassin.

At one point, Dick agrees to attend a party for Bruce and their relationship seems to flourish. Bruce praises Dick for his success on the Raptor case, and also mentions to look into the Landman Building which hosted ex-Lexcorp scientists; most likely those who worked on the Raptor project. Dick also continues to keep a close brotherly relationship with Tim Drake, and helps Tim deal with his many losses during the last year.

After dealing with the Raptor issue, NYC is plagued by a villainous duo called Bride and Groom. Nightwing begins pursuit of these two after some grisly murders, including that of the Lorens family (close friends of his after the Raptor incident). Dick began to get obsessed with finding them, not knowing how far he was willing to go to take them down. Eventually, he formed a makeshift team with some &quot;villains&quot; to find them. They located them, and after killing some of his &quot;team&quot;, Nightwing chased them to a cave, where Bride began a cave-in and the two are trapped there.

Nightwing, along with a group of former Titans, are summoned again by Raven to aid the current group of Teen Titans battle against Deathstroke, who was targeting the latest team to get at his children, Ravager and the resurrected Jericho. Nightwing and the other former Titans continue to work with the current team soon after the battle with Deathstroke so as to investigate the recent murder of Duela Dent.

When the Outsiders were targeted by Checkmate, Nightwing agrees that his team will work with the organization, so long as their actions in Africa are not used against them in the future. The mission however does not go as well as intended, resulting in Nightwing, the Black Queen and Captain Boomerang being captured by Chang Tzu. Later, Batman is called in by Mister Terrific who then rescues Nightwing and the others. Afterwards, Nightwing admits to Batman, that while he accepts that he is an excellent leader, he is not suited to lead a team like the Outsiders, and offers the leadership position to Batman.

Batman accepts the position; however, he feels that the team needs to be remade to accomplish the sorts of missions that he intends them to undertake. As such, he holds a series of tryouts for the team. The first audition involves Nightwing and Captain Boomerang who are sent to a space station under attack by Chemo. During the mission, a confrontation erupts between Nightwing and Boomerang, who has grown tired of fighting for redemption from people like Batman and Nightwing. After taking a beating from Nightwing, he manages to throw him into a shuttle heading for Earth and quits the team. Afterwards, Nightwing furiously confronts Batman. Batman does not deny his actions, and states that this is the sort of thing that the new Outsiders will have to deal with. At this, Nightwing resigns completely from the Outsiders, which Batman feels is best, judging Nightwing too good for that sort of life.

To help himself regain a sense of purpose, Nightwing opted to stay in New York City again, and play the role of the city&#x27;s protector. He takes on a job as a museum curator; and uses the museum as his new base of operations. During his short time there, Dick finds himself once again confronted with Two-Face, who years ago delivered Dick&#x27;s greatest defeat. This time however, Dick soundly defeats Two-Face.

====&quot;Titans Return&quot;====
Nightwing joins a new team of Titans, with the same roster of the New Teen Titans, to stop an offspring of Trigon, which has not yet been named, from enacting his vengeance over Raven and the Titans, of every generation. Nightwing yet again leads the team, and they manage to stop the sons of Trigon from accomplishing their first attempt at global destruction and again a few days later.

Following the defeat of Trigon&#x27;s sons, the Titans are approached by Jericho who had been stuck inhabiting the body of Match, Superboy&#x27;s clone. The Titans managed to free Jericho, but found themselves once again in trouble, due to the fact the Jericho&#x27;s mind had become splintered due to all the bodies he had possessed in the past. Torn between evil and good, Jericho possesses Nightwing&#x27;s body to keep from being captured. During this time, Jericho forces Nightwing to relive all of his greatest pains. Soon after, the JLA arrived, intent on taking Jericho in. Unfortunately they fail to apprehend him.

Following this, Nightwing decides to leave the team again, due to the events of the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline, and due to Batman&#x27;s apparent death, Nightwing feels his attention should be better aimed at protecting Gotham City.

====&quot;Batman R.I.P&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;====
As a precursor to &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;, at the New York Comic Con 2008, DC Comics gave away pins featuring Nightwing, Jason Todd, and Hush with the words &quot;I Am Batman&quot; beneath them. During the storyline, Nightwing is ambushed by the International Club of Villains. He is later seen in Arkham Asylum, frothing at the mouth and presumably drugged, believed by the staff to be Pierrot Lunaire, a member of the club. Scheduled for an experimental lobotomy by Arkham himself, he&#x27;s spared by the ICoV taking hold of the Asylum, wanting to use him and Jezebel Jet, Bruce&#x27;s fiancée at the time, as bait.

As Jezebel&#x27;s capture is revealed to be a red herring, due to her being a part of the Black Glove, Nightwing&#x27;s lobotomy is still pending, but he manages to escape by besting Le Bossu, and joining the fray between the Batman Family, the International Club of Heroes and the Black Glove itself. While he&#x27;s forced to witness Batman&#x27;s dragging down Simon Hurt&#x27;s helicopter and seemingly die in a fiery explosion with his foe, he&#x27;s shown holding Batman&#x27;s cape, discarded during the fight.

Following the events of Batman&#x27;s apparent death during &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Nightwing has closed down shop in New York so as to return to Gotham. He has opted to give up on having a normal job, and instead intends to put all his effort into protecting the city. After his returns he confronts Two-Face and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, proving two of his mentor&#x27;s greatest enemies that he is an equal to Batman after he defeated them. He also finds himself being tasked to raise Bruce&#x27;s biological son Damian with Alfred.

During the events of the &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;, Nightwing is said to have become unapproachable and less emotional. He is seen by the Bat-Suit display cases, still mourning the loss of Batman. Nightwing is said to be resisting the idea that someone needs to take up the mantle of Batman, in spite of arguments from Robin and Alfred Pennyworth that it is necessary. It is later revealed he has no objections to becoming the new Batman, but was ordered not to in Bruce&#x27;s prerecorded message for him, saying that Nightwing and Robin could carry the torch.

Robin later informs Grayson that someone is masquerading as Batman, using similar weaponry to their own. Nightwing is later forced to rescue Damian after he is ambushed by Killer Croc and Poison Ivy. However, Nightwing&#x27;s glider is shot down, and the two are forced to crash land into a skyscraper. To give Damian time to escape, Nightwing offers himself up to the hit squad that is after them. He is about to be shot when he is rescued in a hail of gunfire by the Batman impersonator.

This eventually leads to Dick confronting Jason Todd, who has been posing as Batman. After a long battle between the two, Jason refuses Dick&#x27;s help, while hanging on to a protruding ledge over Gotham&#x27;s bay, Jason lets himself fall into the water. After returning to the cave, Dick assumes the identity of Batman, with Damian as the new Robin.

====The New 52====

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Grayson&#x27;s costume changed the color of the &quot;Nightwing symbol&quot; from blue to red, and the emblem rolled over the shoulders, rather than traveling down the arm onto the middle and ring fingers. The costume also shifted from a skin-tight unitard look to an armored, full body suit, with spiked gauntlets such as Batman&#x27;s rather than simply long gloves. Dick, along with all other members of the Batfamily, was a few years younger than previous incarnations. Despite being in his early twenties as opposed to his mid-late twenties, he was drawn a bit shorter than in his pre-relaunch frame. Starting with issue 19 there was a change in the suit.

On January 21, 2014, DC Comics announced that the series would end in April with issue 30. It was succeeded by &quot;Grayson&quot;, a solo series focusing on Dick&#x27;s exploits as an agent of Spyral. The series lasted until June 2016 and was succeeded by a new &quot;Nightwing&quot; series with DC Rebirth.

====DC Rebirth====

Following the erasure of the knowledge regarding his secret identity from most of the world in the final issue of &quot;Grayson&quot;
 Dick went back to the Nightwing identity in the DC Rebirth era solo series, and the costume&#x27;s colors were changed back to the traditional black and blue. At the start of the series (rebirth) Nightwing is still a member of the Court of Owls (after Robin War) and he goes on missions around the world for the Court. They give him a partner named &quot;Raptor&quot; and like Nightwing he wears a costume, but he is much more violent than Dick and multiple times Dick has to try to stop him from killing. Throughout the story arc, Dick must work as an undercover agent but also has to keep his morals and not kill even if the Court tells him to. Later on in the series, an event causes him to lose his memory, which leads him to the name change of Ric Grayson and temporary retirement of the Nightwing alias.

====Infinite Frontier====

In March 2021, the series became part of DC&#x27;s new relaunch &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;. Tom Taylor became the new writer with Bruno Redondo as the artist. The series follows Dick Grayson&#x27;s return to Blüdhaven as he fights crime while grappling with newfound responsibility from inheriting billions in wealth from Alfred Pennyworth. Dick begins to mentor Jon Kent and decides to use the money to launch a nonprofit organization named after Alfred to support the people of Blüdhaven, which puts him into conflict with Blockbuster and Heartless, a mysterious serial killer preying on the homeless. Dick also meets Melinda Zucco, his long lost half-sister who becomes Blüdhaven&#x27;s mayor. Taylor and Redondo&#x27;s celebrated run was nominated for 11 Eisner Awards and won two, including Best Continuing Series.

Discussing why he likes the character and signed on for the project, McKay cited the character&#x27;s showman personality and background as an entertainer and expressed his excitement for depicting that in the film. He later stated that he wants to introduce a complete adaptation of the character, something that hasn&#x27;t been done in previous film interpretations of him before. McKay continued to state that the director-driven approach is why he loves Warner Bros., and how the franchise is differentiating itself from other popular shared universes.

<text>The China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) is a Chinese partially state-owned multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Beijing, China. It is one of the &quot;big four&quot; banks in China, and is the third largest bank in the world by total assets behind the Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The bank has approximately 13,629 domestic branches. In addition, it maintains overseas branches in London, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, New York City, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago de Chile, Brisbane, Sydney and Auckland. Its total assets reached CN¥ 8.7 trillion in 2009, and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Its headquarters is in Xicheng District.

==History==
CCB was founded on 1 October 1954 under the name of People&#x27;s Construction Bank of China (), and later changed to China Construction Bank on 26 March 1996. It was established to focus on financing for investments, in the context of the People&#x27;s Bank of China beginning to spin off its commercial banking functions.

In January 2002, CCB chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1 million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case.

China Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee&#x27;s approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin.

During the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang&#x27;s missile and nuclear programs.

In 2015, China Construction Bank ranks the 2nd in &quot;Forbes&quot;’ 13th annual Global 2000 ranking of the biggest, most powerful and most valuable companies in the world.

In 2021, China Construction Bank ranks the 3rd largest bank around the world in Forbes&#x27; 2021 Global 2000 list. It ranks 5th in Forbes&#x27; 2022 Global 2000 list.

In 2022, CCB announced the creation of a 30 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) fund, plans to invest in real estate projects and turn them into affordable rental houses. This is part of China&#x27;s initiative to support the real estate sector. Another initiative in the same year was an 80 billion yuan ($11.4 billion) fund to help real estate developers, of which China Construction Bank contributed 50 billion yuan ($7 billion).

At a time when the general trend was for Chinese banks to decrease their business with Russia due to the sanctions against Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, China Construction Bank expanded its business in Russia.

In July 2024, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported China Construction Bank would cut the salary of its staff at its headquarters by 10% with deeper salary cuts for higher-ranking employees, in line of the common prosperity agenda promoted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

==Investment by Bank of America (2005-2013)==

In 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3 billion. It represented the company&#x27;s largest foray into China&#x27;s growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.

On or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America subsequently held about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB&#x27;s issued shares, with a commitment not to sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB.

In May 2009, speculation was raised that Bank of America had sold US$7.3 billion worth of CCB shares after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test.

On 29 August 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3 billion) to an undisclosed group of investors.

In September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion.

== International expansion ==
In 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao.

CCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009.

In 2008, CCB submitted an application to the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a branch in New York City. CCB officially opened its New York branch on 6 June 2009.

In 2013, CCB opened its European Headquarters in Luxembourg.

In 2016, CCB Indonesia was founded by the merger between two banks: Bank Windu Kentjana and Bank Anda.

==Health fund==
China Construction Bank investment division launched a CN¥5 billion (US$731.3 million) fund called China Healthcare Investment Fund to focus on investments in China&#x27;s rapidly growing healthcare sector. The fund focuses on investments in healthcare related sectors including pharmacy, medical equipment manufacturing, medical institutions and services. It is the first domestic investment fund specializing in investments in China&#x27;s healthcare industry.

== Stock exchanges listing ==
In late 2005, China Construction Bank made an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In late 2007, it made China&#x27;s second-largest initial public offering of CN¥57.12 billion (US$7.6 billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

The bank is a component of Hang Seng Index, SSE 180 Index and other indexes of Pan-Chinese and Pan-Asia stock exchanges, such as CSI 300 Index, Hang Seng China 50 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and S&amp;P Asia 50.

The bank was also a component of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.

<doc id="335603" wikidata="Q4922424" url="?curid=335603" title="Black players in professional American football">
<text>Details of the history of black players in professional [[American football]] depend on the professional football league considered, which includes the National Football League (NFL); the American Football League (AFL), a rival league from 1960 through 1969 which eventually merged with the NFL; and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which existed from 1946 to 1949.

==Early years==
Charles Follis is believed to be the first black professional football player, having played for the Shelby Blues from 1902 to 1906. Follis, a two-sport athlete, started getting paid in 1899. 

From its inception in as a loose coalition of various regional teams, the American Professional Football Association had comparatively few African-American players; a total of nine black players suited up for NFL teams between 1920 and 1926, including future attorney, black activist and internationally acclaimed artist Paul Robeson, as well as famed race record producer J. Mayo Williams. Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall were the first black players in what is now the NFL in 1920. Pollard became the first (and until 1989, only) black head coach in 1921; during the early-to-mid-1920s, the league used player-coaches and did not have separate coaching staffs.

==1927 through 1933==
After , all five of the black players that were still in the subsequent National Football League left the league. Several teams were kicked out of the league that year, and with a large number of available, talented white players, black players were generally the first to be removed, never to return again. For the next few years, a black player would sporadically pop up on a team: Harold Bradley Sr. played one season with the Chicago Cardinals in 1928; Phil Scott started at the end position for the Orange Tornadoes in 1929; and Dave Myers played for the Staten Island Stapletons in 1930 and the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1931. 

The Great Depression of 1929 created hardships for African-American players. With the stock market collapsed, white owners of the teams didn&#x27;t want to pay African-American players. The owners claimed that it would be a bad look to see African-Americans working and getting paid while so many white people were without a job. While there were many worthy athletes of color, the refusal of owners led to draught of African-American players. The original Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall colluded with other owners in the league to decide to not pay colored players. In the Amazon Prime show &quot;Evolution of the Black Quarterback&quot;, NFL reporter Steve Wyche stated that &quot;For roughly 12 years, there were no black players in the NFL.&quot;

In contrast, ethnic minorities of other races were fairly common. Thanks to the efforts of the Carlisle Indian School football program, which ended with the school&#x27;s closure in 1918, there were numerous Native Americans in the NFL through the 1920s and 1930s, most famously Jim Thorpe. The Dayton Triangles also featured the first two Asian-Americans in the NFL, Chinese-Hawaiian running back Walter Achiu and Japanese-Scottish quarterback Arthur Matsu, both in 1928, and the first Hispanic players in the NFL, Cuban immigrant Ignacio Molinet of the 1927 Frankford Yellow Jackets and Jess Rodriguez of the 1929 Buffalo Bisons, played in the NFL during this time frame.

==1934 to 1945==
In 1933, the last year of integration, the NFL had two black players, Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Both were gone by the end of the season: Lillard, due largely to his tendency to get into fights, was not invited back to the Chicago Cardinals despite in 1933 being responsible for almost half of the Cardinals&#x27; points, while Kemp quit of his own accord to pursue a coaching career (one that turned out to be long and successful). Many observers will attribute the subsequent lockout of black players to the entry of George Preston Marshall into the league in 1932. Marshall openly refused to have black athletes on his Boston Braves/Washington Redskins team, and reportedly pressured the rest of the league to follow suit. Marshall, however, was likely not the only reason: the Great Depression had stoked an increase in racism and self-inflicted segregation across the country, and internal politics likely had as much of an effect as external pressure. Marshall&#x27;s hostility was specifically directed at the black race; he openly allowed (and promoted) Native Americans on his team, including his first head coach, Lone Star Dietz, widely believed to be a Native American at the time. The choice of Redskins as his team name in 1933 was in part to maintain the native connotations that came with the team&#x27;s previous name, the &quot;Boston Braves&quot;. Another reason for Marshall&#x27;s anti-black sentiment was to curry favor in the Southern United States. Marshall&#x27;s Redskins had a strong following in that part of the country, which he vigorously defended, and he stood up against the NFL&#x27;s efforts to put expansion teams in the South until Clint Murchison Jr.&#x27;s extortion attempt after he acquired the rights to &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot;, the team&#x27;s fight song, and threatened not to let Marshall use it unless he got an expansion team in Dallas.

By 1934, there were no more black players in the league. The NFL did not have another black player until after World War II.

Most black players either ended up in the minor leagues (six joined the American Association and several others found their way into the Pacific Coast Professional Football League) or found themselves onto all-black barnstorming teams such as the Harlem Brown Bombers. Unlike in baseball, where the Negro leagues flourished, no true football Negro league was known to exist until 1946, and by this time, the major leagues had begun reintegrating.

==Post-WWII==
In 1939, UCLA had one of the greatest collegiate football players in history, Kenny Washington, a senior. Washington, an African American, was very popular, and his team had garnered national attention in the print media. After he played in the College All-Star game in August 1940, George Halas asked him not to return to Los Angeles immediately because Halas wanted to sign him to a contract with the Chicago Bears. After a week or so, Washington returned to Los Angeles without an NFL contract. Washington spent the majority of the early 1940s in the Pacific Coast League with the Hollywood Bears, even during World War II, during which he managed to avoid military service, thanks in part to a timely injury that forced him to miss the 1942 season but likely rendered him ineligible for service. Washington, after his injuries were healed, was a rarity in that he was a healthy, available athlete during a time when the NFL was resorting to using partially handicapped players ineligible for service, but received no interest from any NFL teams at the time. (Washington would ultimately serve a tour of duty in the armed forces in 1945 as a type of sports ambassador.)

In 1946, after the Rams had received approval to move to Los Angeles and Washington returned from the war, members of the African American print media made the Los Angeles Coliseum commission aware the NFL did not have any African American players and reminded the commission the Coliseum was supported with public funds. Therefore, its commission had to abide by an 1896 Supreme Court decision, Plessy v. Ferguson, by not leasing the stadium to a segregated team. Also, they specifically suggested the Rams should give Washington a tryout. The commission advised the Rams that they would have to integrate the team with at least one African American in order to lease the Coliseum, and the Rams agreed to this condition. Subsequently, the Rams signed Washington on March 21, 1946. The signing of Washington caused &quot;all hell to break loose&quot; among the owners of the NFL franchises. The Rams added a second Black player, Woody Strode, on May 7, 1946, giving them two Black players going into the 1946 season.

Even after this incident, racial integration was slow to come to the NFL. No team followed the Rams in re-integrating the NFL until the Detroit Lions signed Mel Groomes and Bob Mann in 1948. No black player was selected in the NFL draft until 1949 when George Taliaferro was selected in the 13th round; Taliaferro signed instead with the rival All-America Football Conference. The AAFC, which formed in 1946, was more proactive in signing Black players; in 1946, the Cleveland Browns signed Marion Motley and Bill Willis, and by the time the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, six of the league&#x27;s eight teams had signed Black players, most by the league&#x27;s second season in 1947. The AAFC was also more aggressive in combating racism on the field and aggressively penalized unsportsmanlike conduct that had been motivated by racism, through the work of one of its lead officials, former 1920s NFL star Tommy Hughitt. In comparison, only three of the ten NFL teams (the Rams, Lions and New York Giants) signed a black player before 1950. The Green Bay Packers followed in 1950, but the bulk of NFL teams did not sign a Black player until 1952, by which time every team but the Washington Redskins had signed a Black player.

By 1957, by which time the first black assistant coach, Lowell Perry had been hired by the Steelers, the Redskins still had no Black players. Marshall who had quipped that &quot;We&#x27;ll start signing Negroes when the Harlem Globetrotters start signing whites.&quot; was threatened eviction in 1961 from D. C. Stadium by Interior Secretary Stewart Udall unless they signed a Black player. The Redskins first attempted to comply by drafting Ernie Davis, who refused to play under Marshall; the Redskins in turn traded Davis to the Cleveland Browns. The Redskins eventually signed Bobby Mitchell and two other African American players in 1962.

Quotas limiting the number of Black players were commonplace, and Black players were often stacked into the same positions to allow them to be eliminated as a matter of competition. Reportedly, Black players routinely received lower contracts than whites in the NFL, while in the American Football League there was no such distinction based on race. Position segregation was also prevalent at this time. Walt Frazier, an esteemed high school quarterback who received scholarship offers to play college football, chose to play basketball in college instead, believing he had no future as a Black quarterback when his time came to play professionally (the move paid off, as Frazier would have a Hall of Fame basketball career). However, despite the NFL&#x27;s segregationist policies, after the league merged with the more tolerant AFL in 1970, more than 30% of the merged league&#x27;s players were African American.

The American Football League had the first Black placekicker in U.S. professional football, Gene Mingo of the Denver Broncos (Mingo&#x27;s primary claim to fame, however, was as a running back, and was only secondarily a placekicker); and the first Black regular starting quarterback of the modern era, Marlin Briscoe of the Denver Broncos. Willie Thrower was a back-up quarterback who saw some action in the 1950s for the Chicago Bears. In 1954, running back Joe Perry of the San Francisco 49ers became the first Black player to be recognized as NFL Most Valuable Player, when United Press International named him pro football&#x27;s player of the year.

==21st century==

At the start of the 2014 season, NFL surveys revealed that the league was 68.7% African-American and 28.6% non-Hispanic white, with the remaining 2.7% comprising Asian/Pacific Islander, non-white Hispanics, and those preferring an other category. In the 21st century, the percentage of non-Hispanic white players has decreased slightly, falling from 29.0% in 2003 to 26.8% in 2019. The 2019 racial and gender report card included for the first time a two or more races option to which 9.6% of players reported themselves, thus resulting in a lower African American percentage at 58.9%.

Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins said: &quot;I honestly think it’s harder for a white wide receiver than it is a black quarterback to get recruited at a high level in this day and age,&quot; Biggins said. &quot;Unless you have an extreme skill set that jumps out.&quot;

In recent decades the cornerback position has been played almost exclusively by black players, and the halfback/tailback position overwhelmingly so. From the time New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn played his final season for the team in 2002 until Troy Apke switched from free safety to cornerback in 2021, there were no white cornerbacks in the NFL.

No white running back rushed for 1,000 rushing yards in a season between Craig James in 1985 and Peyton Hillis in 2010. Toby Gerhart&#x27;s alleged race was a factor in why four running backs were drafted ahead of him in the 2010 NFL draft. There are also allegations that racial profiling exists at the lower levels of the game that discourages white players from playing halfback. Since the phaseout of the fullback position, more white halfbacks have been included in the NFL; in addition to Hillis and Gerhart, Danny Woodhead, Brian Leonard, Chase Reynolds, Rex Burkhead, Zach Zenner and Christian McCaffrey have all seen playing time at the position since 2010.

At the start of the 2013 season, 23 of the 32 starting quarterbacks (72%) in the NFL were white. Whites slightly outnumber blacks in the makeup of offensive linemen (49% vs 46%) yet the center position is 82% white.

Of the 32 starting kickers in the NFL in 2013, only one was black. In 2013, there were two African American punters, Reggie Hodges for the Cleveland Browns and Marquette King for the Denver Broncos.

In October 2018, George Taliaferro, the first African American selected by the process of the NFL draft, died at the age of 91.

In Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season, 10 quarterbacks with known Black African ancestry (Cam Newton, Teddy Bridgewater, Dwayne Haskins, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, Dak Prescott, Tyrod Taylor, Deshaun Watson, Russell Wilson) started games for their teams, the most ever on opening week.

==Coaching==
Outside of playing, the first black head coach in the NFL since the end of the player-coach era did not come until 1989, when Art Shell took over the then-Los Angeles Raiders; he was followed three years later by Dennis Green of the Minnesota Vikings. An affirmative action policy known as the Rooney Rule was implemented in 2003 requiring teams to interview racial minorities for head coaching positions and, since 2009, other senior management and player personnel positions. (Such minorities need not specifically be black; Hispanics of any race and persons of any nonwhite race are also eligible to qualify under the rule.)

The league has never had a black franchise owner. It rejected the opportunity to do so twice, first with Rommie Loudd&#x27;s Orlando Suns expansion bid, and then with Reggie Fowler&#x27;s bid on the Minnesota Vikings; in both cases, the prospective black owners were revealed to have inflated their wealth through illegal activities. Only two of the league&#x27;s owners (Korean-born Kim Pegula of the Buffalo Bills, and Pakistani-American Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars) are of non-European descent.

<doc id="335605" wikidata="Q191782" url="?curid=335605" title="Audacity (audio editor)">
<text>Audacity is a free and open-source digital audio editor and recording application software, available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems. 

As of December 6, 2022, Audacity is the most popular download at FossHub, with over 114.2 million downloads since March 2015. It was previously served by Google Code and SourceForge, where it was downloaded over 200 million times. It is now part of Muse Group.

It is licensed under GPL-2.0 or later. Executables with VST3 support are licensed GPL-3-only to maintain license compatibility.

== History ==
The project was started in the fall of 1999 by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg at Carnegie Mellon University, initially under the name &quot;CMU Visual Audio&quot;. On May 28, 2000, Audacity was released as Audacity 0.8 to the public.

Mazzoni eventually left CMU to pursue software development and in particular development of Audacity, with Dannenberg remaining at CMU and continuing development of Nyquist, a scripting language which Audacity uses for some effects.

Over the years, additional volunteer contributors emerged, including James Crook who started the fork &quot;DarkAudacity&quot; to experiment with a new look and other UX changes. Most of its changes were eventually incorporated into the mainline version and the fork ended.

In April 2021, it was announced that Muse Group (owners of MuseScore and Ultimate Guitar) would acquire the Audacity trademark and continue to develop the application, which remains free and open source.

==Features and use==
In addition to recording audio from multiple sources, Audacity can be used for post-processing of all types of audio, including effects such as normalization, trimming, and fading in and out. It has been used to record and mix entire albums, such as by Tune-Yards. It is currently used in the Sound Creation unit of the UK OCR National Level 2 ICT course.

=== Recording ===
Audacity can record multiple tracks at once, provided the sound card supports it. In addition to a normal mode, recordings can be scheduled (&quot;Timer Record&quot;), or used in a Punch in and roll fashion.

=== Non-destructive editing ===
Historically, Audacity is a destructive editor, meaning all changes are directly applied to the waveform. This comes with certain benefits but means that any change made cannot be tweaked later on without undoing all changes in-between. For a long time, non-destructive editing was exclusive to volume envelopes and playback rates, but since version 3, this has been extended to clip trimming and effects.

=== Importing, exporting and conversions ===
Audacity natively imports and exports WAV, AIFF, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and all file formats supported by libsndfile library. Due to patent licensing concerns, the FFmpeg library necessary to import and export proprietary formats such as M4A (AAC) and WMA is not bundled with Audacity but has to be downloaded separately. 

In conjunction with batch processing features, Audacity can be used to convert files from one format to another, or to digitize records, tapes or MiniDiscs.

=== Customizability and extensibility ===
Audacity supports LADSPA, LV2, VST, VST3, Audio Units, Vamp and Nyquist plugins, which allows it to load most audio effect plugins. It additionally features a console for Nyquist, a Lisp dialect, in which users can script their own plugins and support for external python scripting.

Audacity is somewhat customizable and supports arbitrary arrangements of its toolbars, custom themes and enabling and disabling of several features.

In January 2024, Intel introduced some AI-powered capabilities for Audacity as part of its OpenVINO plugin suite.

=== Audio analysis ===

Audacity has several features to allow for spectrum analysis using the Fourier transform algorithm and spectrograms. As with effects, additional analysis plugins can be added, such as ones that check audiobooks for ACX compatibility.

===Limitations===
While Audacity has some features found in digital audio workstations, it should not be considered as such yet. In its current form, it is an audio editor and recorder. In particular, MIDI editing, piano rolls, virtual instruments, parameter automation and channel routings are not yet implemented.

Due to the use of wxWidgets, which do not have full iOS or Android support, Audacity cannot run on mobile platforms.

=== Other features ===

Audacity can make precise adjustments to speed (tempo) while maintaining pitch, to synchronize audio with video or for precise running time. It also has a large array of digital effects and plug-ins, including: noise reduction based on sampling the noise to be minimized, vocal reduction and isolation for creation of karaoke tracks and isolated vocal tracks, pitch adjustment maintaining speed, and speed adjustment maintaining pitch.
Audacity also has support for multi-channel modes with sampling rates up to 96 kHz with 32 bits per sample. It can also detect dropout errors made while recording with an overburdened CPU.

==Language support==
In addition to English, Audacity is available in Afrikaans, Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Corsican, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese and Welsh. 

The documentation, the Audacity Manual, is available only in English. The Audacity Forum offers technical support in English.

==Architecture==
The diagram illustrates Audacity&#x27;s layers and modules. Note the three important classes within wxWidgets, each of which has a reflection in Audacity. 

Higher-level abstractions result from related lower-level ones. For example, the BlockFile system is a reflection of and is built on wxWidgets&#x27; wxFiles. Lower down in the diagram is a narrow strip for platform-specific implementation layers. 

Both wxWidgets and PortAudio are OS abstraction layers, containing conditional code that chooses different implementations depending on the target platform.

==Reception==
As free and open-source software, Audacity is very popular in education, encouraging its developers to make the user interface easier for students and teachers.

Audacity won the SourceForge 2007 and 2009 Community Choice Award for Best Project for Multimedia.

Jamie Lendino of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; recently rated it 4/5 stars Excellent and said: &quot;If you&#x27;re looking to get started in podcasting or recording music, it&#x27;s tough to go wrong with Audacity. A powerful, free, open-source audio editor that&#x27;s been available for years, Audacity is still the go-to choice for quick-and-dirty audio work.&quot;

CNET rated Audacity 5/5 stars, calling it &quot;feature-rich and flexible&quot;. Preston Gralla of &quot;PC World&quot; said: &quot;If you&#x27;re interested in creating, editing, and mixing you&#x27;ll want Audacity.&quot; Jack Wallen of &quot;Tech Republic&quot; praised its features and ease-of-use. 

In &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; (2003), open-source software advocate Eric S. Raymond wrote of Audacity: &quot;The central virtue of this program is that it has a superbly transparent and natural user interface, one that erects as few barriers between the user and the sound file as possible.&quot;

Some reviewers and users have criticized Audacity for its inconvenient UX design, unsightly GUI and comparative lack of features compared with Adobe Audition. Matthew McLean wrote: &quot;Audacity looks a bit more dated and basic, but this will be appealing to many folks who&#x27;re just starting out&quot;.

In May 2021, after the project was acquired by Muse Group, there was a draft proposal to add opt-in telemetry to the code to record application usage. Some users responded negatively, with accusations of turning Audacity into spyware. The company reversed course, falling back to error/crash reporting and optional update checking instead. Another controversy in July 2021 resulted from a change to the privacy policy which said that although personal data was stored on servers in the European Economic Area, the program would &quot;occasionally [be] required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our external counsel in the USA&quot;. That July, the Audacity team apologized for the changes to the privacy policy and removed mention of the data storage provision which was added &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot;.

<text>The flag of [[North Macedonia]] (; ) depicts a stylized yellow sun on a red field, with eight broadening rays extending from the center to the edge of the field. It was created by Miroslav Grčev and was adopted on 5 October 1995.

The eight-rayed sun derives from the national emblem and represents the &quot;new sun of Liberty&quot; referred to in &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; (&quot;Today over Macedonia&quot;). The first post-Yugoslav flag of the country, adopted in 1992, known as the Kutlesh flag, featured the Vergina Sun, a symbol that had been discovered at Aigai, the first capital and burial ground of the ancient kings of Macedon. Greece imposed a year-long economic embargo in order to persuade the country to remove it from its flag, resulting in the current design.

==History==
===Flag of People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia (1944–1946)===

The modern Macedonian state was proclaimed underground on 2 August 1944 by the Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM), the state&#x27;s supreme legislative and executive body until 1946. The state was originally known as Democratic Federal Macedonia and was renamed the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia in 1945. The ASNOM became operational in December, shortly after the German retreat. The flag was adopted during ASNOM&#x27;s second plenary session in December. The first version of the flag depicted a gold-edged five-pointed red star centred on a red field.

===Flag of Socialist Republic of Macedonia (1946–1992)===

Between December 1946 and September 1991, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (known as the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia until 1963) was one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was the only Yugoslav republic not to use the Pan-Slavic colours on its flag. Macedonia instead adopted an amended version of its previous flag, depicting communist symbols as the gold-edged five-pointed red star in the canton against a red field in a design similar to the flags of the Soviet Union or the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This flag was adopted on 31 December 1946 under Article 4 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia. It remained in use until 1992.

===Kutlesh flag (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Todor Petrov, president of the nationalist Macedonian diaspora organization World Macedonian Congress, proposed the Vergina Sun as the national symbol of the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia). On 11 August 1992, the newly independent Republic of Macedonia adopted the new flag to replace the old Communist &quot;red star&quot; insignia. The flag depicted the &quot;Vergina Sun&quot; symbol, a stylised yellow sun centred on a red field with eight main and eight secondary rays emanating from the sun, each tapering to a point. This ancient symbol was named after the Greek town where it had been discovered in archaeological excavations of the ancient Macedonian city of Aigai.
The Vergina Sun was regarded by Greece as a symbol of continuity between ancient Macedonia and modern Greek culture, and in particular as a symbol of the Argead dynasty of Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great. From the late 1970s it had also been adopted by many both in Greece and the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia to symbolise historical connections with ancient Macedonia and had been paraded in demonstrations by Greeks and ethnic Macedonians at home and abroad.

The flag, the new state&#x27;s constitution and its name all became the focus of a dispute between the two countries, during which Greece imposed an economic blockade on the Republic from February 1994. In July 1995, Greece lodged a request with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for exclusive trademark protection to the Vergina Sun.

Greek objections also prevented the flag from being flown at the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City. The blockade was lifted in October 1995 when an agreement was reached to change the flag, modify the constitution and resolve the naming dispute through United Nations-sponsored negotiations. The change of the flag was at first not accepted by conservative Macedonians, nationalists, and Greek patriots. In the first years after the change, both flags were officially flown for a long time. Between 1995 and 1998, in the municipalities where then-opposition party VMRO-DPMNE ruled, only the old flag was flown from institution buildings. Popular opinion was divided about the merits of changing the flag. As part of the Prespa Agreement (Article 8) of 2018, which resolved the naming dispute, the government of North Macedonia committed to removing the Vergina Sun from all public spaces and from public use, including its use in flags. It started removing the symbol since 12 August 2019.

Toni Deskoski, Macedonian professor of International Law, argues that the Vergina Sun is not a Macedonian symbol but a Greek symbol that is used by ethnic Macedonians in the nationalist context of Macedonianism and that the ethnic Macedonians need to get rid of it.

===Current flag (1995–present)===
In 1995, the Macedonian government appointed Miroslav Grčev to draft a proposal for a new flag. Grčev went on to propose 12 designs for the flag that would have a sun in the center. Eventually, Grčev&#x27;s last proposal was accepted - the design where the sun rays are on the entire surface of the flag. On 5 October 1995, the current flag of North Macedonia was adopted by the Macedonian parliament. The flag represents a golden sun with eight rays on a red field.

<text>A wait state is a delay experienced by a computer processor when accessing external memory or another device that is slow to respond.

Computer microprocessors generally run much faster than the computer&#x27;s other subsystems, which hold the data the CPU reads and writes. Even memory, the fastest of these, cannot supply data as fast as the CPU could process it. In an example from 2011, typical PC processors like the Intel Core 2 and the AMD Athlon 64 X2 run with a clock of several GHz, which means that one clock cycle is less than 1 nanosecond (typically about 0.3 ns to 0.5 ns on modern desktop CPUs), while main memory has a latency of about 15–30 ns. Some second-level CPU caches run slower than the processor core.

When the processor needs to access external memory, it starts placing the address of the requested information on the address bus. It then must wait for the answer, that may come back tens if not hundreds of cycles later. Each of the cycles spent waiting is called a wait state.

Wait states are a pure waste of a processor&#x27;s performance. Modern designs try to eliminate or hide them using a variety of techniques: CPU caches, instruction pipelines, instruction prefetch, branch prediction, simultaneous multithreading and others. No single technique is 100% successful, but together can significantly reduce the problem.

==Energy conservation==
Wait states can be used to reduce the energy consumption of a processor, by allowing the main processor clock to either slow down or temporarily pause during the wait state if the CPU has no other work to do. Rather than spinning uselessly in a tight loop waiting for data, sporadically reducing the clock speed in this manner helps to keep the processor core cool and to extend battery life in portable computing devices.

==Alternative meaning on IBM mainframes==
On IBM mainframes, the term &quot;wait state&quot; is used with a different meaning. A wait state refers to a CPU being halted, possibly due to some kind of serious error condition (such as an unrecoverable error during operating system to IPL). A wait state is indicated by bit 14 of the PSW being set to 1, with other bits of the PSW providing a wait state code giving a reason for the wait. In z/Architecture mode, the wait state code is found in bits 116-127.

<doc id="335612" wikidata="Q901095" url="?curid=335612" title="Nuclear Overhauser effect">
<text>The nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) is the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one population of spin-active nuclei (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N etc.) to another via cross-relaxation. A phenomenological definition of the NOE in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is the change in the integrated intensity (positive or negative) of one NMR resonance that occurs when another is saturated by irradiation with an RF field. The change in resonance intensity of a nucleus is a consequence of the nucleus being close in space to those directly affected by the RF perturbation.

The NOE is particularly important in the assignment of NMR resonances, and the elucidation and confirmation of the structures or configurations of organic and biological molecules. The 1H two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment and its extensions are important tools to identify stereochemistry of proteins and other biomolecules in solution, whereas in solid form crystal x-ray diffraction typically used to identify stereochemistry. The heteronuclear NOE is particularly important in 13C NMR spectroscopy to identify carbons bonded to protons, to provide polarization enhancements to such carbons to increase signal-to-noise, and to ascertain the extent the relaxation of these carbons is controlled by the dipole-dipole relaxation mechanism.

==History==
The NOE developed from the theoretical work of American physicist Albert Overhauser who in 1953 proposed that &quot;nuclear&quot; spin polarization could be enhanced by the microwave irradiation of the conduction &quot;electrons&quot; in certain metals. The electron-nuclear enhancement predicted by Overhauser was experimentally demonstrated in 7Li metal by T. R. Carver and C. P. Slichter also in 1953. A general theoretical basis and experimental observation of an Overhauser effect involving only &quot;nuclear&quot; spins in the HF molecule was published by Ionel Solomon in 1955. Another early experimental observation of the NOE was used by Kaiser in 1963 to show how the NOE may be used to determine the relative signs of scalar coupling constants, and to assign spectral lines in NMR spectra to transitions between energy levels. In this study, the resonance of one population of protons (1H) in an organic molecule was enhanced when a second distinct population of protons in the same organic molecule was saturated by RF irradiation. The application of the NOE was used by Anet and Bourn in 1965 to confirm the assignments of the NMR resonances for β,β-dimethylacrylic acid and dimethyl formamide, thereby showing that conformation and configuration information about organic molecules in solution can be obtained. Bell and Saunders reported direct correlation between NOE enhancements and internuclear distances in 1970 while quantitative measurements of internuclear distances in molecules with three or more spins was reported by Schirmer et al.

Richard R. Ernst was awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing Fourier transform and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, which was soon adapted to the measurement of the NOE, particularly in large biological molecules. In 2002, Kurt Wuthrich won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution, demonstrating how the 2D NOE method (NOESY) can be used to constrain the three-dimensional structures of large biological macromolecules. Professor Anil Kumar was the first to apply the two-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser Effect (2D-NOE now known as NOESY) experiment to a biomolecule, which opened the field for the determination of three-dimensional structures of biomolecules in solution by NMR spectroscopy.

==Relaxation==

The NOE and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation are closely related phenomena. For a single spin- nucleus in a magnetic field there are two energy levels that are often labeled α and β, which correspond to the two possible spin quantum states, + and -, respectively. At thermal equilibrium, the population of the two energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution with spin populations given by &quot;P&quot;α and &quot;P&quot;β. If the spin populations are perturbed by an appropriate RF field at the transition energy frequency, the spin populations return to thermal equilibrium by a process called &quot;spin-lattice relaxation&quot;. The rate of transitions from α to β is proportional to the population of state α, &quot;P&quot;α, and is a first order process with rate constant &quot;W&quot;. The condition where the spin populations are equalized by continuous RF irradiation (&quot;P&quot;α = &quot;P&quot;β) is called &quot;saturation&quot; and the resonance disappears since transition probabilities depend on the population difference between the energy levels.

In the simplest case where the NOE is relevant, the resonances of two spin- nuclei, I and S, are chemically shifted but not J-coupled. The energy diagram for such a system has four energy levels that depend on the spin-states of I and S corresponding to αα, αβ, βα, and ββ, respectively. The &quot;W&quot;&#x27;s are the probabilities per unit time that a transition will occur between the four energy levels, or in other terms the rate at which the corresponding spin flips occur. There are two single quantum transitions, &quot;W&quot;1I, corresponding to αα ➞ βα and αβ ➞ ββ; &quot;W&quot;1S, corresponding to αα ➞ αβ and βα ➞ ββ; a zero quantum transition, &quot;W&quot;0, corresponding to βα ➞ αβ, and a double quantum transition corresponding to αα ➞ ββ.

While rf irradiation can only induce single-quantum transitions (due to so-called quantum mechanical selection rules) giving rise to observable spectral lines, dipolar relaxation may take place through any of the pathways. The dipolar mechanism is the only common relaxation mechanism that can cause transitions in which more than one spin flips. Specifically, the dipolar relaxation mechanism gives rise to transitions between the αα and ββ states (&quot;W&quot;2) and between the αβ and the βα states (&quot;W&quot;0).

Expressed in terms of their bulk NMR magnetizations, the experimentally observed steady-state NOE for nucleus I when the resonance of nucleus S is saturated (formula_1) is defined by the expression:
::: formula_2
where formula_3 is the magnetization (resonance intensity) of nucleus formula_4 at thermal equilibrium. An analytical expression for the NOE can be obtained by considering all the relaxation pathways and applying the Solomon equations to obtain
::: formula_5
where
::: formula_6 and formula_7.
formula_8 is the total longitudinal dipolar relaxation rate (formula_9) of spin &quot;I&quot; due to the presence of spin &quot;s&quot;, formula_10 is referred to as the &quot;cross-relaxation&quot; rate, and formula_11 and formula_12 are the magnetogyric ratios characteristic of the formula_4 and formula_14 nuclei, respectively.

Saturation of the degenerate &quot;W&quot;1S transitions disturbs the equilibrium populations so that &quot;P&quot;αα = &quot;P&quot;αβ and &quot;P&quot;βα = &quot;P&quot;ββ. The system&#x27;s relaxation pathways, however, remain active and act to re-establish an equilibrium, except that the &quot;W&quot;1&quot;S&quot; transitions are irrelevant because the population differences across these transitions are fixed by the RF irradiation while the population difference between the &quot;W&quot;I transitions does not change from their equilibrium values. This means that if only the single quantum transitions were active as relaxation pathways, saturating the formula_14 resonance would not affect the intensity of the formula_4 resonance. Therefore to observe an NOE on the resonance intensity of I, the contribution of formula_17 and formula_18 must be important. These pathways, known as &quot;cross-relaxation&quot; pathways, only make a significant contribution to the spin-lattice relaxation when the relaxation is dominated by dipole-dipole or scalar coupling interactions, but the scalar interaction is rarely important and is assumed to be negligible. In the homonuclear case where formula_19, if formula_18 is the dominant relaxation pathway, then saturating formula_14 increases the intensity of the formula_4 resonance and the NOE is &quot;positive&quot;, whereas if formula_23 is the dominant relaxation pathway, saturating formula_14 decreases the intensity of the formula_4 resonance and the NOE is &quot;negative&quot;.

==Molecular motion==
Whether the NOE is positive or negative depends sensitively on the degree of rotational molecular motion. The three dipolar relaxation pathways contribute to differing extents to the spin-lattice relaxation depending a number of factors. A key one is that the balance between ω2, ω1 and ω0 depends crucially on molecular rotational correlation time, formula_26, the time it takes a molecule to rotate one radian. NMR theory shows that the transition probabilities are related to formula_26 and the Larmor precession frequencies, formula_28, by the relations:
:::formula_29

:::formula_30

:::formula_31

where formula_32 is the distance separating two spin- nuclei.
For relaxation to occur, the frequency of molecular tumbling must match the Larmor frequency of the nucleus. In mobile solvents, molecular tumbling motion is much faster than formula_28. The so-called extreme-narrowing limit where formula_34). Under these conditions the double-quantum relaxation W2 is more effective than W1 or W0, because τc and 2ω0 match better than τc and ω1. When ω2 is the dominant relaxation process, a positive NOE results.

:::formula_35
:::formula_36
:::formula_37

:::formula_38

This expression shows that for the homonuclear case where &quot;I&quot; = &quot;S&quot;, most notably for 1&quot;H&quot; NMR, the maximum NOE that can be observed is 1\2 irrespective of the proximity of the nuclei. In the heteronuclear case where &quot;I&quot; ≠ &quot;S&quot;, the maximum NOE is given by 1\2 (&quot;γ&quot;S/&quot;γ&quot;I), which, when observing heteronuclei under conditions of broadband proton decoupling, can produce major sensitivity improvements. The most important example in organic chemistry is observation of 13C while decoupling 1H, which also saturates the 1J resonances. The value of &quot;γ&quot;S/&quot;γ&quot;I is close to 4, which gives a maximum NOE enhancement of 200% yielding resonances 3 times as strong as they would be without NOE. In many cases, carbon atoms have an attached proton, which causes the relaxation to be dominated by dipolar relaxation and the NOE to be near maximum. For non-protonated carbon atoms the NOE enhancement is small while for carbons that relax by relaxation mechanisms by other than dipole-dipole interactions the NOE enhancement can be significantly reduced. This is one motivation for using deuteriated solvents (e.g. CDCl3) in 13C NMR. Since deuterium relaxes by the quadrupolar mechanism, there are no cross-relaxation pathways and NOE is non-existent. Another important case is 15N, an example where the value of its magnetogyric ratio is negative. Often 15N resonances are reduced or the NOE may actually null out the resonance when 1H nuclei are decoupled. It is usually advantageous to take such spectra with pulse techniques that involve polarization transfer from protons to the 15N to minimize the negative NOE.

==Structure elucidation==
While the relationship of the steady-state NOE to internuclear distance is complex, depending on relaxation rates and molecular motion, in many instances for small rapidly tumbling molecules in the extreme-narrowing limit, the semiquantitative nature of positive NOE&#x27;s is useful for many structural applications often in combination with the measurement of J-coupling constants. For example, NOE enhancements can be used to confirm NMR resonance assignments, distinguish between structural isomers, identify aromatic ring substitution patterns and aliphatic substituent configurations, and determine conformational preferences.

Nevertheless, the inter-atomic distances derived from the observed NOE can often help to confirm the three-dimensional structure of a molecule. In this application, the NOE differs from the application of J-coupling in that the NOE occurs through space, not through chemical bonds. Thus, atoms that are in close proximity to each other can give a NOE, whereas spin coupling is observed only when the atoms are connected by 2–3 chemical bonds. However, the relation &quot;η&quot;IS(max)= obscures how the NOE is related to internuclear distances because it applies only for the idealized case where the relaxation is 100% dominated by dipole-dipole interactions between two nuclei I and S. In practice, the value of ρI contains contributions from other competing mechanisms, which serve only to reduce the influence of &quot;W&quot;0 and &quot;W&quot;2 by increasing &quot;W&quot;1. Sometimes, for example, relaxation due to electron-nuclear interactions with dissolved oxygen or paramagnetic metal ion impurities in the solvent can prohibit the observation of weak NOE enhancements. The observed NOE in the presence of other relaxation mechanisms is given by

:::formula_39
where ρ⋇ is the additional contribution to the total relaxation rate from relaxation mechanisms not involving cross relaxation. Using the same idealized two-spin model for dipolar relaxation in the extreme narrowing limit:
:::formula_40

It is easy to show that
:::formula_41

Thus, the two-spin steady-state NOE depends on internuclear distance only when there is a contribution from external relaxation. Bell and Saunders showed that following strict assumptions ρ⋇/τc is nearly constant for similar molecules in the extreme narrowing limit. Therefore, taking ratio&#x27;s of steady-state NOE values can give relative values for the internuclear distance &quot;r&quot;. While the steady-state experiment is useful in many cases, it can only provide information on relative internuclear distances. On the other hand, the initial &quot;rate&quot; at which the NOE grows is proportional to &quot;r&quot;IS−6, which provides other more sophisticated alternatives for obtaining structural information via transient experiments such as 2D-NOESY.

==Two-dimensional NMR ==

The motivations for using two-dimensional NMR for measuring NOE&#x27;s are similar as for other 2-D methods. The maximum resolution is improved by spreading the affected resonances over two dimensions, therefore more peaks are resolved, larger molecules can be observed and more NOE&#x27;s can be observed in a single measurement. More importantly, when the molecular motion is in the intermediate or slow motional regimes when the NOE is either zero or negative, the steady-state NOE experiment fails to give results that can be related to internuclear distances.
Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) is a 2D NMR spectroscopic method used to identify nuclear spins undergoing cross-relaxation and to measure their cross-relaxation rates. Since 1H dipole-dipole couplings provide the primary means of cross-relaxation for organic molecules in solution, spins undergoing cross-relaxation are those close to one another in space. Therefore, the cross peaks of a NOESY spectrum indicate which protons are close to each other in space. In this respect, the NOESY experiment differs from the COSY experiment that relies on J-coupling to provide spin-spin correlation, and whose cross peaks indicate which 1H&#x27;s are close to which other 1H&#x27;s through the chemical bonds of the molecule.

The basic NOESY sequence consists of three 90° pulses. The first pulse creates transverse spin magnetization. The spins precess during the evolution time t1, which is incremented during the course of the 2D experiment. The second pulse produces longitudinal magnetization equal to the transverse magnetization component orthogonal to the pulse direction. Thus, the idea is to produce an initial condition for the mixing period τm. During the NOE mixing time, magnetization transfer via cross-relaxation can take place. For the basic NOESY experiment, τm is kept constant throughout the 2D experiment, but chosen for the optimum cross-relaxation rate and build-up of the NOE. The third pulse creates transverse magnetization from the remaining longitudinal magnetization. Data acquisition begins immediately following the third pulse and the transverse magnetization is observed as a function of the pulse delay time t2. The NOESY spectrum is generated by a 2D Fourier transform with respect to t1 and t2. A series of experiments are carried out with increasing mixing times, and the increase in NOE enhancement is followed. The closest protons show the most rapid build-up rates of the NOE.

Inter-proton distances can be determined from unambiguously assigned, well-resolved, high signal-to-noise NOESY spectra by analysis of cross peak intensities. These may be obtained by volume integration and can be converted into estimates of interproton distances. The distance between two atoms formula_42 and formula_43 can be calculated from the cross-peak volumes formula_44 and a scaling constant formula_45

::: formula_46

where formula_45 can be determined based on measurements of known fixed distances. The range of distances can be reported based on known distances and volumes in the spectrum, which gives a mean formula_45 and a standard deviation formula_49, a measurement of multiple regions in the NOESY spectrum showing no peaks, &quot;i.e.&quot; noise formula_50, and a measurement error formula_51. The parameter formula_52 is set so that all known distances are within the error bounds. This shows that the lower range of the NOESY volume can be shown

::: formula_53

and that the upper bound is

::: formula_54

Such fixed distances depend on the system studied. For example, locked nucleic acids have many atoms whose distance varies very little in the sugar, which allows estimation of the glycosidic torsion angles, which allowed NMR to benchmark LNA molecular dynamics predictions. RNAs, however, have sugars that are much more conformationally flexible, and require wider estimations of low and high bounds.

In protein structural characterization, NOEs are used to create constraints on intramolecular distances. In this method, each proton pair is considered in isolation and NOESY cross peak intensities are compared with a reference cross peak from a proton pair of fixed distance, such as a geminal methylene proton pair or aromatic ring protons. This simple approach is reasonably insensitive to the effects of spin diffusion or non-uniform correlation times and can usually lead to definition of the global fold of the protein, provided a sufficiently large number of NOEs have been identified. NOESY cross peaks can be classified as strong, medium or weak and can be translated into upper distance restraints of around 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 Å, respectively. Such constraints can then be used in molecular mechanics optimizations to provide a picture of the solution state conformation of the protein. Full structure determination relies on a variety of NMR experiments and optimization methods utilizing both chemical shift and NOESY constraints.

==Heteronuclear NOE==
&lt;br&gt;
== Some experimental methods ==
Some examples of one and two-dimensional NMR experimental techniques exploiting the NOE include:

* NOESY, Nuclear Overhauser effect Spectroscopy
* HOESY, Heteronuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
* ROESY, Rotational frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
* TRNOE, Transferred nuclear Overhauser effect
* DPFGSE-NOE, Double pulsed field gradient spin echo NOE experiment

NOESY is the determination of the relative orientations of atoms in a molecule, for example a protein or other large biological molecule, producing a three-dimensional structure. HOESY is NOESY cross-correlation between atoms of different elements. ROESY involves spin-locking the magnetization to prevent it from going to zero, applied for molecules for which regular NOESY is not applicable. TRNOE measures the NOE between two different molecules interacting in the same solution, as in a ligand binding to a protein. In a DPFGSE-NOE experiment, a transient experiment that allows for suppression of strong signals and thus detection of very small NOEs.

== Examples of nuclear Overhauser effect ==

The figure (top) displays how Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy can elucidate the structure of a switchable compound. In this example, the proton designated as {H} shows two different sets of NOEs depending on the isomerization state (&quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot;) of the switchable azo groups. In the &quot;trans&quot; state proton {H} is far from the phenyl group showing blue coloured NOEs; while the &quot;cis&quot; state holds proton {H} in the vicinity of the phenyl group resulting in the emergence of new NOEs (show in red).

Another example (bottom) where application where the NOE is useful to assign resonances and determine configuration is polysaccharides. For instance, complex glucans possess a multitude of overlapping signals, especially in a proton spectrum. Therefore, it is advantageous to utilize 2D NMR experiments including NOESY for the assignment of signals. See, for example, NOE of carbohydrates.

<text>The Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE) is an open source software framework used for network programming. It provides a set of object-oriented C++ classes designed to help address the inherent complexities and challenges in network programming by preventing common errors.

==History==
ACE was initially developed by Douglas C. Schmidt during his graduate work at the University of California, Irvine. Development followed him to the Washington University in St. Louis, where he was employed. ACE is open-source software released by WU&#x27;s Distributed Object Computer (DOC) group. Its development continued in the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) at Vanderbilt University.

==Features==
ACE provides a standardized usage for operating system/machine specific features. It provides common data types and methods to access the powerful but complex features of modern operating systems. These include: inter-process communication, thread management, efficient memory management, etc. 

It was designed to be portable and provide a common framework. The same code will work on most Unixes, Windows, VxWorks, QNX, OpenVMS, etc., with minimal changes. Due to this cross-platform support, it has been widely used in the development of communication software. Some of the successful projects that have used ACE includes: Motorola Iridium satellites, Boeing Wedgetail&#x27;s Australian airborne early warning &amp; control (AEW&amp;C) system, and others.

ACE used software design patterns.

<doc id="335617" wikidata="Q23374" url="?curid=335617" title="Chorizo">
<text>Chorizo ( , ; ; see below) is a type of pork sausage originating from the Iberian Peninsula. It is made in many national and regional varieties in several countries on different continents. Some of these varieties are quite different from each other, occasionally leading to confusion or disagreements over the names and identities of the products in question.

In Europe, Spanish and Portuguese is a fermented, cured, smoked sausage which gets its smokiness and deep red color from dried, smoked, red peppers (/); it may be sliced and eaten without cooking, or added as an ingredient to add flavor to other dishes. Elsewhere, &quot;chorizo&quot; may not be fermented or cured, and require cooking before eating. In Mexico it is made with chili peppers instead of paprika.

Iberian &quot;chorizo&quot; is eaten sliced in a sandwich, grilled, fried, or simmered in liquid, including apple cider or strong alcoholic beverages such as . It is also used as a partial replacement for ground (minced) beef or pork.

==Names==
The word &quot;chorizo&quot; probably comes from the Late Latin &#x27;salted&#x27;, and came into Spanish via the Portuguese ; it is a doublet of the Spanish word &#x27;sausage&#x27;, which was transmitted through Italian .

In English, &quot;chorizo&quot; is usually pronounced , though sometimes the Castilian Spanish sound is used: .

Pronunciation and spelling vary slightly among the Iberian languages:
* , or 
* 
* 

==Varieties by region==
===Europe===
According to the EU geographical indications register, in 2023, there were 8 recognized varieties in Portugal: Chouriço de Ossos de Vinhais, Azedo de Vinhais, Mouro de Portalegre, Abóbora de Barroso-Montalegre, Portalegre, Carne de Estremoz, Estremoz e Borba, and do Baixo Alentejo. In Spain there are two varieties recognized: Chorizo Riojano, and Chorizo de Cantimpalos.

====Spain====

Generally, Spanish &quot;chorizo&quot; is made from coarsely chopped pork and pork fat, seasoned with garlic, – a smoked paprika – and salt. It can be classed as either (spicy) or (sweet), depending upon the type of used. There are hundreds of regional varieties of Spanish &quot;chorizo&quot;, some smoked and some unsmoked, that are each made somewhat differently and may include herbs and other ingredients. For example, &quot;chorizo de Pamplona&quot; is a thicker sausage with the meat more finely ground. Among the varieties is from the La Rioja region, which has PGI protection within the EU.

&quot;Chorizo&quot; is made in short or long and hard or soft varieties; leaner varieties are suited to being eaten at room temperature as an appetizer or tapas, whereas the fattier versions are generally used for cooking. A rule of thumb is that long, thin &quot;chorizos&quot; are sweet, and short &quot;chorizos&quot; are spicy, although this is not always the case.

Spain produces many other pork specialties as well, such as and , that are cured and air-dried in a similar way. is a lean, cured meat, served in slices rather than for cooking, made by marinating and air-drying a pork tenderloin. is another cured sausage without the seasoning of &quot;chorizo&quot;, flavoured with black peppercorns instead.

Depending on the variety, &quot;chorizo&quot; can be eaten sliced without further cooking, for example in a sandwich, or can be grilled, fried, or baked alongside other foodstuffs, and is an ingredient in several dishes where it accompanies beans, such as or and can be served as a tapas, such as &quot;Chorizo in Red Wine sauce&quot;.

Versions of these dishes (with all the trimmings, literally &quot;sacraments&quot;) include other preserved meats such as (cured bacon) and (blood sausage) along with the &quot;chorizo&quot;.

====Portugal====

Portuguese or , the latter usually denoting a larger or thicker version, is distinct from Spanish &quot;chorizo&quot;. The base ingredients are pork, fat, paprika, garlic, and salt. Wine and hot peppers are also common in some regions. It is then stuffed into natural casings from pig or lamb and slowly dried over smoke. The many different varieties differ in color, shape, spices and taste. White pepper, piri-piri, cumin and cinnamon are used in some varieties. Many dishes of Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine make use of , including and .
A popular way to prepare &quot;chouriço&quot; is slicing it part-way through and cooking it over an alcohol flame at the table (sometimes called , but more commonly just &quot;chouriço assado&quot;) in purpose-made glazed earthenware burners.

In Johannesburg, South Africa, the many Portuguese immigrants in the 1960s from Portugal and Mozambique tended to settle in a suburb called La Rochelle (Little Portugal). Most of them either returned to Portugal or moved on to more affluent suburbs in the city, but restaurants in the area and the very well-supported annual &quot;Lusitoland&quot; fundraiser festival have on the menu.

In the heavily Portuguese counties in the US states of Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, is often served with little neck clams and white beans. sandwiches on grinder rolls, with sautéed green peppers and onions, are commonly available at local delis and convenience stores. Stuffed quahogs (also known as stuffies), a Rhode Island specialty, usually include .

In Portugal, can be made with blood, similar to blood sausage or black pudding and is called (blood ) or morcela. Other types of include , , , , and .

====Mexico====


Based on the uncooked Spanish (fresh chorizo), the Mexican versions of &quot;chorizo&quot; are made not only from fatty pork, but also beef, venison, chicken, and turkey. Kosher and vegan versions are also available. The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. Due to the historically high cost of imported Spanish paprika, Mexican &quot;chorizo&quot; is traditionally made with native cultivars of the same species of chili pepper used in Spain, making the Mexican version spicier than the Spanish one. Mexican &quot;chorizo&quot; also typically uses vinegar, instead of the white wine normally used in Spain.

This is the main type of &quot;chorizo&quot; known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including most of the United States, but is not frequently found in Europe.


The area around Toluca specializes in &quot;green&quot; &quot;chorizo&quot;, made with some combination of tomatillo, cilantro, chili peppers, and garlic. Most Mexican &quot;chorizo&quot;, though, is a deep reddish color. It is often available in two varieties, fresh and dried, though fresh is much more common. Some of the cheapest commercial &quot;chorizos&quot; use offal stuffed in inedible plastic casing to resemble sausage links, rather than muscle meat. Before consumption, the casing is usually cut open and the sausage is fried in a pan and mashed with a fork until it resembles finely minced ground beef. Some &quot;chorizo&quot; is made without any casings. Pork and beef are cured overnight in vinegar and chili powder. Served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it has the finely minced texture mentioned above, and is quite intense in flavor.

In Mexico, restaurants and food stands make tacos, (or ), burritos, and using cooked chorizo, and it is also a popular pizza topping. is a popular breakfast dish in Mexico and areas of the United States with Mexican populations. It is made by mixing fried &quot;chorizo&quot; with scrambled eggs. is often used in breakfast burritos, tacos, and taquitos. Another popular Mexican recipe is fried &quot;chorizo&quot; combined with pinto or black refried beans. This combination is often used in as a spread, or as a side dish where plain refried beans would normally be served. In Mexico and the southwestern United States chorizo is also used to make (or ), a popular appetizer consisting of small pieces of &quot;chorizo&quot; served with melted cheese and eaten with small corn tortillas or tortilla chips. In heavily Mexican parts of the United States, a popular filling for breakfast tacos is , diced potatoes sautéed until soft with &quot;chorizo&quot; mixed in.

====Central America and the Caribbean====

In Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, &quot;chorizo&quot; and are considered two different types of meat. Puerto Rican &quot;chorizo&quot; is a smoked, well-seasoned sausage nearly identical to the smoked versions in Spain. Puerto Rican and Dominican have a very different taste and appearance. The seasoned meat is stuffed into a pork casing and is formed very long by hand. It is then hung to air-dry. can then be fried in oil or cooked with rice or beans. It is eaten with many different dishes.

Salvadorean &quot;chorizo&quot; is short, fresh (not dried) and tied in twins.

==== United States ====
In contrast to Spanish &quot;chorizo&quot;, in the United States the term generally refers to a sausage that is never dried, has a fattier filling, and is very spicy. It is most popular in areas with large Cuban, Dominican, or Puerto Rican populations or near the Mexican border, especially in the Southwest near Chihuahua, Sonora, and Nuevo León. It is also found further north in places like Austin, Texas or Santa Fe, New Mexico, where its earliest evidence dates to well before the Wild West. It is most commonly eaten for breakfast on its own, or mixed with a local version of .

In Louisiana, Creole and Cajun cuisine both feature a variant of &quot;chorizo&quot; called , which is frequently used in the Creole dish of red beans and rice. As with its cousin to the west, smoking this variant is an acceptable practice in local cuisine.

====South America====

In Ecuador, many types of sausage have been directly adopted from European or North American cuisine. All sorts of salami, either raw or smoked, are known just as salami. Most commonly known are sorts from Spanish &quot;chorizo&quot;, Italian pepperoni, and wiener sausages; wieners are the most popular. Some local specialities include , , and . , as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically cooked pork blood encased in pork intestine casing (black pudding in English). is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. &quot;Chorizo&quot; is a mixture of chopped pork meat, pork fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, achiote, and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color. A traditional dish consists of fried egg, mashed potatoes, avocado, salad, and slices of fried &quot;chorizo&quot;.

In Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, chorizo is the name for any coarse meat sausage. Spanish-style &quot;chorizo&quot; is also available, and is distinguished by the name (&#x27;Spanish chorizo&#x27;). Argentine &quot;chorizos&quot; are normally made of pork, and are not spicy hot. Some Argentine &quot;chorizos&quot; include other types of meat, typically beef. In Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Peru, fresh &quot;chorizo&quot;, cooked and served in a bread roll, is called a . In Colombia, &quot;chorizo&quot; is usually accompanied by .

In Brazil, is the word used for what in the rest of Latin America is ; meat sausages similar to the &quot;chorizos&quot; of other Latin American countries are called . Many varieties of Portuguese-style and are used in many different types of dishes, such as .

In Bolivia, &quot;chorizos&quot; are made of pork, fried and served with salad (tomato, lettuce, onion, boiled carrots and ), , and a slice of bread soaked with &quot;chorizo&quot; fat. &quot;Chorizo&quot; sandwiches, without , are also eaten.

===South and Southeast Asia===
====East Timor====

 is made in East Timor. It was introduced by the Portuguese, with their colonization of East Timor.

====Goa====

In Goa, India, which was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years and has a large percentage of Goan Catholics, is made from pork that is marinated in a mixture of vinegar, red chilies, and spices such as garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon, and stuffed into casings. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying. These are enjoyed either with the local Goan Portuguese-style crusty bread, or pearl onions, or both. The sausages are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in rice pilaf.

Three kinds of are found in Goa: dry, wet, and skin. Dry is aged in the sun for long periods (three months or more). Wet has been aged for about a month or less. Skin , also aged, is rare and difficult to find. It consists primarily of minced pork skin along with some of its subcutaneous fat. All three are made in variations such as hot, medium, and mild. Other variations exist, depending on the size of the links, which range from . Typically, the wet varieties tend to be longer than the dry ones.

Goan should be distinguished from &quot;Goan frankfurters&quot;, which look similar to equivalents in the United States, but have a predominantly peppercorn flavor.

====Philippines====
&quot;Longaniza&quot; (; Visayan: , , ) are Philippine &quot;chorizos&quot; flavored with indigenous spices, and may be made of chicken, beef, or even tuna. While the term &quot;longaniza&quot; generally refers to fresh sausages, it is also used in the Philippines to refer to cured sausages. Philippine are often dyed red with seeds. There are dozens of variants from various regions in the Philippines.

<doc id="335623" wikidata="Q752216" url="?curid=335623" title="Gilbert's syndrome">
<text>Gilbert syndrome (GS) is a syndrome in which the liver of affected individuals processes bilirubin more slowly than the majority. Many people never have symptoms. Occasionally jaundice (a slight yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) may occur.
Gilbert syndrome is due to a genetic variant in the &quot;UGT1A1&quot; gene which results in decreased activity of the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzyme. It is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and occasionally in an autosomal dominant pattern depending on the type of variant. Episodes of jaundice may be triggered by stress such as exercise, menstruation, or not eating. Diagnosis is based on higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood without either signs of other liver problems or red blood cell breakdown.
Typically no treatment is needed. Gilbert syndrome is associated with decreased cardiovascular health risks. If jaundice is significant, phenobarbital may be used, which aids in the conjugation of bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome affects about 5% of people in the United States. Males are more often diagnosed than females. It is often not noticed until late childhood to early adulthood. The condition was first described in 1901 by Augustin Nicolas Gilbert.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Jaundice===
Gilbert syndrome produces an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream, but normally has no consequences. Mild jaundice may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting, and infections, but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic. Severe cases are seen by yellowing of the skin tone and yellowing of the conjunctiva in the eye.

Gilbert syndrome has been reported to contribute to an accelerated onset of neonatal jaundice. The syndrome cannot cause severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates by itself, but it may have a summative effect on rising bilirubin when combined with other factors, for example in the presence of increased red blood cell destruction due to diseases such as G6PD deficiency. This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated, as the high serum bilirubin can cause irreversible neurological disability in the form of kernicterus.

===Detoxification of certain drugs===
The enzymes that are defective in GS – UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) – are also responsible for some of the liver&#x27;s ability to detoxify certain drugs. For example, Gilbert syndrome is associated with severe diarrhea and neutropenia in patients who are treated with irinotecan, which is metabolized by UGT1A1.

While paracetamol (acetaminophen) is not metabolized by UGT1A1, it is metabolized by one of the other enzymes also deficient in some people with GS. A subset of people with GS may have an increased risk of paracetamol toxicity.

===Cardiovascular effects===
The mild increase in unconjugated bilirubin due to Gilbert syndrome is closely related to the reduction in the prevalence of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, related risk factors, and all-cause mortality. Observational studies emphasize that the antioxidant effects of unconjugated bilirubin may bring survival benefits to patients.

Several analyses have found a significantly decreased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in individuals with GS.

Specifically, people with mildly elevated levels of bilirubin (1.1 mg/dl to 2.7 mg/dl) were at lower risk for CAD and at lower risk for future heart disease. These researchers went on to perform a meta-analysis of data available up to 2002, and confirmed the incidence of atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries) in subjects with GS had a close and inverse relationship to the serum bilirubin. This beneficial effect was attributed to bilirubin IXα which is recognized as a potent antioxidant, rather than confounding factors such as high-density lipoprotein levels.

This association was also seen in long-term data from the Framingham Heart Study. Moderately elevated levels of bilirubin in people with GS and the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype were associated with one-third the risk for both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease as compared to those with the (TA)6/(TA)6 genotype (i.e. a normal, nonmutated gene locus).

Platelet counts and MPV (mean platelet volume) are decreased in patients with Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome. The elevated levels of bilirubin and decreasing levels of MPV and CRP in Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome patients may have an effect on the slowing down of the atherosclerotic process.

===Other===
Symptoms, whether connected or not to GS, have been reported in a subset of those affected: fatigue (feeling tired all the time), difficulty maintaining concentration, unusual patterns of anxiety, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of weight, itching (with no rash), and others, such as humor change or depression. But scientific studies found no clear pattern of adverse symptoms related to the elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in adults. However, other substances glucuronidized by the affected enzymes in those with Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome could theoretically, at their toxic levels, cause these symptoms. Consequently, debate exists about whether GS should be classified as a disease. However, Gilbert syndrome has been linked to an increased risk of gallstones.

== Cause ==
Mutations in the &quot;UGT1A1&quot; gene lead to Gilbert Syndrome. The gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme, which can be found in the liver cells and is responsible for preparing bilirubin for removal from the body.

The bilirubin-UGT enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. Glucuronic acid is transferred to unconjugated bilirubin, which is a yellowish pigment made when your body breaks down old red blood cells, and then being converted to conjugated bilirubin during the reaction. Conjugated bilirubin passes from the liver into the intestines with bile. It&#x27;s then excreted in stool.

People with Gilbert syndrome have approximately 30 percent of normal bilirubin-UGT enzyme function, which contributes to a lower rate of glucuronidation of unconjugated bilirubin. This substance then accumulates in the body, causing mild hyperbilirubinemia.

==Genetics==
Gilbert syndrome is a phenotypic effect, mostly associated with increased blood bilirubin levels, but also sometimes characterized by mild jaundice due to increased unconjugated bilirubin, that arises from several different genotypic variants of the gene for the enzyme responsible for changing bilirubin to the conjugated form.

Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome is characterized by a 70–80% reduction in the glucuronidation activity of the enzyme (UGT1A1). The &quot;UGT1A1&quot; gene is located on human chromosome 2.

More than 100 polymorphisms of the &quot;UGT1A1&quot; gene are known, designated as &quot;UGT1A1*n&quot; (where n is the general chronological order of discovery), either of the gene itself or of its promoter region. &quot;UGT1A1 &quot;is associated with a TATA box promoter region; this region most commonly contains the genetic sequence A(TA)6TAA; this variant accounts for about 50% of alleles in many populations. However, several allelic polymorphic variants of this region occur, the most common of which results from adding another dinucleotide repeat TA to the promoter region, resulting in A(TA)7TAA, which is called &quot;UGT1A1*28&quot;; this common variant accounts for about 40% of alleles in some populations, but is seen less often, around 3% of alleles, in Southeast and East Asian people and Pacific Islanders.

In most populations, Gilbert syndrome is most commonly associated with homozygous A(TA)7TAA alleles. In 94% of GS cases, two other glucuronosyltransferase enzymes, UGT1A6 (rendered 50% inactive) and UGT1A7 (rendered 83% ineffective), are also affected.

However, Gilbert syndrome can arise without TATA box promoter polymorphic variants; in some populations, particularly healthy Southeast and East Asians, Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome is more often a consequence of heterozygote missense mutations (such as Gly71Arg also known as &quot;UGT1A1*6&quot;, Tyr486Asp also known as &quot;UGT1A1*7&quot;, Pro364Leu also known as &quot;UGT1A1*73&quot;) in the actual gene coding region, which may be associated with significantly higher bilirubin levels.

Because of its effects on drug and bilirubin breakdown and because of its genetic inheritance, Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome can be classed as a minor inborn error of metabolism.

==Diagnosis==
People with GS predominantly have elevated unconjugated bilirubin, while conjugated bilirubin is usually within the normal range or is less than 20% of the total. Levels of bilirubin in GS patients are reported to be from 20 μM to 90 μM (1.2 to 5.3 mg/dl) compared to the normal amount of &lt; 20 μM. GS patients have a ratio of unconjugated/conjugated (indirect/direct) bilirubin commensurately higher than those without GS.

The level of total bilirubin is often further increased if the blood sample is taken after fasting for two days, and a fast can, therefore, be useful diagnostically. A further conceptual step that is rarely necessary or appropriate is to give a low dose of phenobarbital: the bilirubin will decrease substantially.

Tests can also detect DNA variants of &quot;UGT1A1&quot; by polymerase chain reaction or DNA fragment sequencing.

===Differential diagnosis===
While Gilbert syndrome is considered harmless, it is clinically important because it may give rise to a concern about a blood or liver condition, which could be more dangerous. However, these conditions have additional indicators:
* In GS, unless another disease of the liver is also present, the liver enzymes ALT/SGPT and AST/SGOT, as well as albumin, are within normal ranges.
* Crigler–Najjar syndrome (types I and II), a different glucuronyl transferase disorder, is much more severe, with 0–10% UGT1A1 activity, with affected individuals at risk of brain damage in infancy (type I) and teenage years (type II).
* Hemolysis of any cause can be excluded by a full blood count, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and the absence of reticulocytosis (elevated reticulocytes in the blood would usually be observed in haemolytic anaemia).
* Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome are rarer autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an increase of conjugated bilirubin.
* Viral hepatitis associated with increase of conjugated bilirubin can be excluded by negative blood samples for antigens specific to the different hepatitis viruses.
* Cholestasis can be &quot;excluded&quot; by normal levels of bile acids in plasma, the absence of lactate dehydrogenase, low levels of conjugated bilirubin, and ultrasound scan of the bile ducts.
* Vitamin B12 deficiency - elevated bilirubin levels (and MCV counts above 90–92) can be associated with a vitamin B12 deficiency.

==Treatment==
Typically no treatment is needed. If jaundice is significant phenobarbital may be used.

==Research directions==
===Vitamin levels===
Studies conducted so far suggest that subjects with GS may have lower levels of vitamin D and folic acid than control subjects, having these levels inversely correlated with bilirubin levels. It may be that GS may impair the metabolism or absorption of these vitamins, or that these vitamins may affect the expression or activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme that is responsible for bilirubin conjugation. However, these studies had limitations, such as the small sample size, the lack of a standardized definition of GS, the possible confounding factors of diet, lifestyle, and medication use, and the cross-sectional and observational design that does not allow for causal inference.

===The role of bilirubin in health and disease===
Ongoing studies suggest that mild hyperbilirubinaemia in GS may have beneficial effects, probably due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinaemia in GS may protect against oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanisms and pathways of bilirubin protection are not fully elucidated, and the optimal level and range of bilirubin are unknown. The genetic and environmental factors that influence UGT1A1 expression and activity are also poorly characterized and may affect the variability and penetrance of GS. Despite the fact that hyperbilirubinemia in GS is associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, the clinical significance and implications of these GS research findings are unclear, and can not yet be translated into preventive or therapeutic strategies.

== History ==
Gilbert syndrome was first described by French gastroenterologist Augustin Nicolas Gilbert and co-workers in 1901. In German literature, it is commonly associated with Jens Einar Meulengracht.

Alternative, less common names for this disorder include:
* Familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
* Constitutional liver dysfunction
* Familial non-hemolytic non-obstructive jaundice
* Icterus intermittens juvenilis
* Low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia
* Unconjugated benign bilirubinemia

==Society and culture==
===Notable cases===
* Napoleon
* Arthur Kornberg, Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 1959
* Nicky Wire, Manic Street Preachers bassist
* Alexandr Dolgopolov (tennis player)
* Jonas Folger, MotoGP rider.

<doc id="335630" wikidata="Q237156" url="?curid=335630" title="Laodice I">
<text>Laodice I (, &quot;Laodíkē&quot;, meaning &quot;justice of the people&quot;; flourished 3rd century BC) was a Greek noblewoman of Anatolia who was a close relative of the early Seleucid dynasty and was the first wife of the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus II Theos.

==Family background==
Laodice was the daughter of Achaeus, a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Anatolia. Her mother is unknown. Her family had power in Anatolia with strong royal connections. She had one sister, Antiochis, who mothered Attalus I of Pergamon.

Her father, Achaeus, was the second son of King Seleucus I Nicator and his first wife, Apama I. Her name implies a strong Seleucid connection, as she was the namesake of her paternal aunt and her paternal great-grandmother of this name.

==Life and marriage==
Her birth date is unknown, and little is known on her early life. Laodice I married her paternal first cousin Antiochus II Theos before 266 BC as his first wife. She married Antiochus II before he was the heir to the Seleucid throne.

When her paternal uncle Antiochus I Soter died in 261 BC, Antiochus II succeeded his father. Through her marriage, Laodice I became a Seleucid queen. Little is known on her relationship with Antiochus II. Laodice I bore her husband two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax, and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.

==Divorce with Antiochus II==
In 252 BC after the Second Syrian War, Antiochus II was obliged to make peace with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Antiochus made peace with the Pharaoh by divorcing Laodice and marrying the daughter of Ptolemy II, Berenice, with the understanding that any children born from their union would inherit the Seleucid throne.

Although she was no longer queen, Laodice was still a very powerful and political influential figure. In their divorce settlement, Antiochus gave Laodice various land grants throughout Anatolia which are known through inscriptions. Laodice I owned a large estate in the Hellespont, other properties near Cyzicus, Ilion and in Caria. In a royal record at Sardis mentions her land titles were to be kept as royal land in disposal in grants or sales.

In a clause in the divorce settlement, Laodice was allowed to sell or donate land in which she had the right to choose which attachment of a city were to be passed on to the new landlord, unless Laodice had taken care of the matter herself. Antiochus gave her a grace period to settle matters on her land before she decided whether to hold on to the land or dispose it. She may have been given the revenue of two harvests with which to pay a nominal purchase price to set at the valuation of the land for tax purposes. When Laodice was able to make payment, the land she intended to purchase could remain part of royal land and couldn&#x27;t be made as a part of an attachment to a city. The only one who could order to reallocate or rearrange land lots was the King.

When Laodice sold a land attachment, the new owner was not permitted to remove it from the city or attach it to another. As she was a former queen, as a part of a land sale she possessed everything on the land that was transferred to her during the sale. She collected revenue from annual agriculture harvests and other forms from her lands. Antiochus, on one occasion, granted Laodice a complete property tax exemption.

==Deaths of Antiochus II and his second family==
During Antiochus II&#x27;s marriage to Berenice, they had a son called Antiochus. Laodice lived at Ephesus. On 28 January 246 BC, Ptolemy II died, and was succeeded by Ptolemy III Euergetes. After the death of Ptolemy II, Antiochus II left his second family in Antioch and returned to Laodice. He named his first son with Laodice as his successor to the throne.

In July 246 BC, Antiochus II died (some suggest that he was poisoned by a revengeful Laodice) leaving a confusing dynastic situation. Seleucus II succeeded his father as king and his brother Antiochus Hierax was named co-ruler in Sardis. They lived with Laodice at Ephesus. Laodice, either for revenge or to prevent civil war, had Berenice and her son murdered in the late summer of 246 BC.

Out of his outrage, the brother of Berenice, Ptolemy III, declared war the same year and invaded the Seleucid Empire. His suspicions about the deaths of his sister and nephew were firmly grounded and were a part of the cause of the Third Syrian War also known as the ‘Laodicean War’ or the ‘War of Laodice’. During the war, while Seleucus was fighting Ptolemy, Laodice supported the revolt of her second son against her first son. This occurred in 244 BC which caused a civil war for the next 17 years between Seleucus II and Antiochus Hierax. Eventually, Ptolemy captured Laodice and had her killed. This happened no earlier than 236 BC because there are two honorific inscriptions in Babylon dedicated to her dated to 247 BC and 237 BC.

<text>The Xiang River is the chief river of the Lake Dongting drainage system of the middle Yangtze, the largest river in Hunan Province, China. It is the second-largest tributary (after the Min River) in terms of surface runoff, the fifth-largest tributary by drainage area of the Yangtze tributaries. The river flows generally northeast through the provinces of Guangxi and Hunan, its tributaries reaching into Jiangxi and Guangdong.

Traditionally, it was regarded that the West (left) Branch is the Main Stream of the Upper Xiang, which rises in the &quot;Haiyang Mountains&quot; between Xing&#x27;an and Lingchuan counties of Guangxi. In the 1st national water census of China in 2011, the East Branch Xiao River, was identified as the Main Stem of the Upper Xiang. The Ping Island of Yongzhou is the meeting of the two streams, the West source originating from Guangxi and the East source of the Xiao River originating from Lanshan County of Hunan.

With the tributaries, the Xiang has a river basin area of , of which Hunan has an area of . In a situation of Guangxi source, the Xiang has a length of ; In another situation of Xiao River as the main source stream, the Xiang has a length of .

== Geography ==

The Upper Xiang River has two large Branches, the West (left) and East (right). The West Branch is traditionally known as the main stream, originating from the &quot;Haiyang Mountains&quot; in Guilin of Guangxi. In Hunan, there had been debate on whether or not this tradition of regarding the West Branch as the main stream is actually founded. According to the &quot;2011 national Water Census of China&quot;, it is the East Branch, not the West, that should be regarded as the main stream of the Xiang. This is because it is both longer and contributes a greater volume of water than the western branch. The east branch retains the name of Xiao River, and it rises in &quot;Yegou Mountain&quot; (野狗岭) of Xiangjiangyuan Township (湘江源瑶族乡) in Lanshan County, Hunan. The two branches converge at &quot;Ping Island&quot; to form the Main Stem of the Xiang. The Main Stem is located in the eastern part of Hunan. The Xiang generally flows southwest to northeast from Lingling District of Yongzhou to Xiangyin County, and empties into the Yangtze River via Lake Dongting.

===Upper Course===
The Left Branch, also known as the &quot;West Branch&quot; of the upper course is traditionally known the upper Xiang River, the portion of the Xiang River upstream called &quot;Xiangshui River&quot; (湘水). From the headwaters at Xing&#x27;an County, Guangxi, the West Branch flows approximately to &quot;Ping Island&quot; of Yongzhou, where it is joined by the Xiao River to form the middle Xiang River.

Historically it was recognized that the headwaters of the Xiang rise in Haiyang Mountains. People say the Xiang and the Li Rivers share the same origin, because the upper reaches of the two rivers are connected by the ancient Lingqu Canal, which is located in Xing&#x27;an County, Guangxi. According to a traditional saying, 70% of the water in Lingqu flows into the Xiang and 30% flows into the Li River. In the past, the canal, along with the Xiang River and the Gui River provided an important waterway connecting the Yangtze River with the Pearl River Delta.

===Xiao River===
The &quot;Xiao River&quot; is the East Branch of the upper course. As of 2011 Water Census of China, it may be regarded as the Main Stream of the upper Xiang River. Xiao rises in Xiangjiangyuan Township of Lanshan County, from the headwaters to Ping Island at the confluence with the West Branch (Left Branch) from Guangxi, it runs . With the tributaries, the Xiao River has a drainage basin area of .

==Tributaries==
==In culture==
In the Chinese folk religion, the river is protected by the &quot;Xiang River goddesses&quot; or &quot;Xiang Consorts&quot; Ehuang and Nüying. They are said to have been the daughters of the legendary ruler Yao and the wives of his successor Shun. Unable to bear the pain of their husband&#x27;s death, they committed suicide in this river. An etiological myth relates the spots on the spotted bamboo (), also known as the Xiang bamboo ( or ), Xiang Consort bamboo (), and teardrop bamboo (), to the tears of the weeping consorts. They were worshipped in some form by the people of Chu during the Warring States and its poet Qu Yuan is credited with writing the &quot;Ladies Xiang&quot; () to document the ritual songs in their honor.

The late Tang Dynasty poet Yu Wuling is supposed to have been fond of the scenery along the Xiang River.

The classic Chinese novel &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; includes a character Shi Xiangyun who takes one of the characters of her name from the river.

Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Shian Kian Weekly Review&quot;, founded on 14 June 1919, publicized Marxism in Changsha.

<text>In architecture, a turret is a small circular tower, usually notably smaller than the main structure, that projects outwards from a wall or corner of that structure. Turret also refers to the small towers built atop larger tower structures. 

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;turret&quot; originated in around the year 1300 from &quot;touret&quot; which meant “small tower rising from a city wall, castle, or other larger building.” &quot;Touret&quot; came from the Old French term &quot;torete&quot; which is the diminutive form of &quot;tour&quot;, meaning “tower.” &quot;Tour&quot; dates back to the Latin word &quot;turris&quot; which also means “tower.”

There is a record from 1862 of &quot;turret&quot; being used to mean “low, flat gun tower on a warship.” Around this time, the word split into two separate definitions, with this definition being the one that goes on to describe gun turrets, a separate idea from the architectural element.

== Uses ==
Turrets initially arose on castles out of a defensive need for greater visibility. Since they project outwards from the main structure, turrets gave garrisons a better line of sight to spot possible attackers. Thus, they also provided a better defensive position for defensive military forces to originate from. Turrets constructed above the rest of a structure only improve visibility, providing 360-degree views of the surrounding land allowing enemies to be spotted from further away. This provided more time for a fortress’s defenders to prepare for an attack. Turrets offered greater resilience to attacks and were less vulnerable than free-standing watch towers.

As their defensive necessity lessened, turrets began to be used as ornamental elements instead. Turrets were sometimes used to house staircases, and towards the end of the thirteenth century they became important in this fashion. They allowed for the staircases to occupy smaller spaces without affecting the layout of the structure to which they were attached. Since turrets project outward from a structure, they directed attention, and more ornamentation was focused on them than the rest of the facade.

== Structure ==
Turrets could vary in size, although they all shared the appearance of small towers, either built into walls or atop larger towers. They projected outward from the structure they were incorporated into, greatly contributing to the characteristics discussed in the &quot;Uses&quot; section. Turrets do not extend down to the ground like full-sized towers. When built into walls, turrets are generally found at the corner of structures where two walls meet. Sometimes, however, they are found in the middle of a wall. Since turrets projected outward from a structure, they had to be supported either by weight-bearing corbels or be cantilevered. This put a restriction on how large a turret could be constructed. Turrets were expensive to build, as hoisting stones high above the ground to construct them was highly laborious. It is thought that many were timber-framed and cladded in stone which would have reduced the weight needed to be supported by corbels/cantilevers and reduced the cost of construction. Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel. The top of a turret could be finished with a pointed roof or another type of apex or might have had crenellations, such as in the image above.

== Turrets on homes ==
In the modern day, turrets are most commonly found on homes. These turrets are still towers that project outwardly from the main structure, not extending down to the ground. Residential turrets were greatly popularized in the Queen Anne residential style, and can often be found on a variety of Victorian and Queen Anne home designs today. Some residential turrets are designed to be open-air balconies as well. Turrets can help to bring in more natural light and are often used to create more space in a home. These elements make a property more interesting to prospective buyers and homes with a turret generally appraise higher than without one. Alternatively, turrets usually increase construction costs of a home as they are more difficult to frame and support than more common elements.

<doc id="335640" wikidata="Q40242" url="?curid=335640" title="Cleopatra V">
<text>Cleopatra V (; died or ) was a Ptolemaic Queen of Egypt. She is the only surely attested wife of Ptolemy XII. Her only known child is Berenice IV, but she was also probably the mother of Cleopatra VII. It is unclear if she died around the time of Cleopatra VII&#x27;s birth in 69 BC, or if it was her or a daughter named Cleopatra VI who co-ruled Ptolemaic Egypt with Berenice IV in 58–57 BC during the political exile of Ptolemy XII to Rome. No written records about Cleopatra V exist after 57 BC and two years later Berenice IV was overthrown by Ptolemy XII, his throne restored with Roman military aid.

==Descent and marriage==
Because of the poor body of source material Cleopatra V is a very obscure member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Only a few ascertained facts about her are known. Many aspects of her life are the subject of controversial theories. In all known ancient sources she is given the byname &quot;Tryphaena&quot;. She may have borne this name before accession to the throne when she assumed the traditional royal name &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. In some modern specialist literature Cleopatra Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII, is referred to as &quot;Cleopatra VI.&quot; The historian of classical antiquity Werner Huß refers to her as &quot;Cleopatra VII Tryphaena&quot;.

The parentage of Cleopatra V is not recorded. She may have been a legitimate or illegitimate daughter of Ptolemy IX or the legitimate daughter of Ptolemy X. It is mentioned that in 88 BC, Ptolemy X Alexander fled Egypt with his wife Berenice III and his daughter. Cleopatra Tryphaena might be this unspecified daughter. 

Cleopatra V is first mentioned in 79 BC in two papyri. One of these papyri dates from January 17, 79 BC. In that year she married Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt. They received divine worship as &quot;theoí Philopátores kai Philádelphoi&quot; (&quot;father-, brother- and sister-loving gods&quot;). Cleopatra’s Egyptian titles, found primarily at Edfu and Philae, include &quot;Daughter of Re&quot;, &quot;Female Ruler&quot;, and &quot;Mistress of Two Lands&quot;.

==Death and identity==
It is unclear how long Cleopatra V lived, and with which mentions of Cleopatra Tryphaena in the historical record she should be identified, as the numbering used to distinguish the Ptolemies is a modern invention. Cleopatra Tryphaena V vanished around the time Cleopatra VII was born (69 BC): her name begins to disappear from monuments and papyri, and there is a papyrus of Ptolemy XII from 69 BC that does not mention her but would be expected to do so had she still been alive.

There is some indication that Cleopatra may have died in 69 BC — she may have died in childbirth or was possibly murdered. Should she really have died that early, then the Cleopatra Tryphaena who is mentioned — after the expulsion of Ptolemy XII — as co-ruler of Egypt (together with Berenice IV) in 58 and 57 BC, and died around 57 BC, must be her daughter, numbered by some historians as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. This is also supported by Porphyry.

On the other hand, there is a dedication on the Temple of Edfu from December 5, 57 BC that inscribes Cleopatra Tryphaena&#x27;s name alongside Ptolemy XII&#x27;s (who however was not present in Egypt at that time), which would have meant the king&#x27;s wife rather than daughter and would be unlikely had Ptolemy XII&#x27;s wife really died already twelve years earlier. Thus some, though not all, modern historians consider Cleopatra V to be identical with the purported Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, and have her living to c. 57 BC. This would comport with the account by Strabo, who reports Ptolemy XII to have had only three daughters; these can reliably be identified as Berenice IV, Cleopatra VII, and Arsinoe IV as the king&#x27;s daughters, so that there would not be left any room for a Cleopatra VI. Werner Huss assumes, that quarrels erupted between Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII in 69 BC and that as a result of these disputes Cleopatra V fell in disgrace and was compelled to resign.

Cleopatra V was probably the mother of Cleopatra VII. Michael Grant comes to the conclusion that &quot;on the whole&quot; it seems most likely Cleopatra V was the mother of Cleopatra VII, noting that had Cleopatra VII been illegitimate, her &quot;numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.&quot; He continues we should rule out the hypothesis Cleopatra VII was conceived by Ptolemy XII&#x27;s second wife-to-be while Cleopatra V was on the scene, and that if this unknown second wife would have been Cleopatra VII&#x27;s mother and later made &quot;queen legitimized&quot;, Cleopatra VII would still have been considered a bastard and &quot;her Roman foes would not have missed the hint.&quot; Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah and was &quot;only technically illegitimate&quot; (however, he contends that whatever Cleopatra&#x27;s ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most), but notes if this unknown woman was not Cleopatra&#x27;s mother, then Cleopatra V would be her mother. Part of his argument is based on Strabo&#x27;s mention of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s having only three daughters, Berenice being the only legitimate one. But as Grant notes that, of all the attacks on Cleopatra VII, her being illegitimate is not among them, and that it is only mentioned in a casual statement by Strabo.

Most scholars agree that Berenice IV was a daughter of Cleopatra V. A different wife of Ptolemy XII may have been the mother of the younger siblings of Cleopatra VII, that is Arsinoe IV, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV. However, Christopher Bennett thinks that Cleopatra V was the mother of all known children of Ptolemy XII. In 55 BC, upon his return to Egypt from exile with Roman military aid, Ptolemy XII had his rival daughter Berenice IV executed for usurping his throne.

<text>Mary Shakespeare (née Arden; — September 1608) was the mother of William Shakespeare.

==Biography==
Mary was born about 1536 in Wilmcote, the daughter of Robert Arden, a gentleman farmer and junior descendant of the Arden family, who were prominent in Warwickshire. She was the youngest of eight daughters, and when her father died in 1556 she inherited land at Snitterfield and Wilmcote from him as a dowry. The house was left to her stepmother Agnes Hill. Richard Shakespeare, the father of John Shakespeare, was a tenant farmer on land owned by her father in Snitterfield. As the daughter of Richard&#x27;s landlord, she may have known John since childhood. Mary married John Shakespeare in 1557, when she was 20 years old and her spouse was approximately 26 years old. She bore eight children: Joan (1558), Margaret (1562–1563), William (1564–1616), Gilbert (1566–1612), Joan (1569–1646), Anne (1571–1579), Richard (1574–1613), and Edmund (1580–1607). Though Mary gave birth to many children, several of them died young. Their first daughter, Joan, born 1558 died; the name being used again for their third daughter. Their second daughter, Margaret, also died in infancy. Some members of the wider Arden family were of the Catholic faith. John died in 1601 and Mary died in September 1608.

Mary was born into a family of status and her ancestors were well connected in society, including Thomas Arden, who fought in the Second Barons&#x27; War (1264–67) on the side of Simon de Montfort; Robert Arden who fought in the Wars of the Roses, and John Arden who served at the court of Henry VII.
Mary Arden&#x27;s House in Wilmcote was maintained in good condition as a working farmhouse, until it was bought by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1930 and refurnished in the Tudor period style. In 2000 it was discovered that the building preserved as Mary Arden&#x27;s house had belonged to a friend and neighbour, Adam Palmer, and the house was accordingly renamed Palmer&#x27;s Farm. The house that had belonged to the Arden family – which was near to Palmer&#x27;s Farm – had been acquired by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1968 for preservation as part of a farmyard, without knowing its true provenance. The house and farm are open as a historic museum displaying 16th-century life.

<text>The Kitáb-i-Íqán (, &quot;Book of Certitude&quot;) is a book written by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith. It is the religion&#x27;s primary theological work and one of many texts that Baháʼís hold sacred. It is considered the second most important book in the Baháʼí writings, with the most important being the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot;. One Baháʼí scholar states that it can be regarded as the &quot;most influential Quran commentary in Persian outside the Muslim world,&quot; because of its international audience.

The &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; is sometimes referred to as the Book of Íqán or simply The Íqán.

== History ==
The &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; was composed partly in Persian and partly in Arabic by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, in 1861, when he was living as an exile in Baghdad, then a province of the Ottoman Empire.

The uncle of the Báb, Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid Muḥammad, had been perplexed to hear that the promised one of Islam was his own nephew. When he was told that this was the same objection voiced by the uncle of the prophet Muhammad of Islam, he was shaken and decided to investigate the matter. In 1861 he traveled to Karbala, Iraq, to visit his brother, Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥasan-ʻAlí, and then went to Baghdad to meet Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. There he posed four questions about the signs of the appearance of the promised one in writing to Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. The 200 pages (in original languages) of the &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; were written in the course of at most two days and two nights in reply about January 15, 1861.

The &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; was probably the first work of Bahá’u’lláh published in print. A lithographed edition was published by relatives of the Báb (the Afnáns) in Bombay, India, around 1882 by the Ḥasaní Zívar Press. It was first translated into English in 1904, one of the first works of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh to appear in English. Shoghi Effendi re-translated the work into English in 1931.

== Contents ==
The &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; consists of two parts. The first part of the book deals with the foundational discourse that divine revelation is progressive and religions are related to one another, with each major monotheistic religion accepting the previous ones and, often in veiled terms, prophesying the advent of the next one. Since the questioner is a Muslim, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh uses verses from the Bible to show how a Christian could interpret his own sacred texts in allegorical terms to come to believe in the next religion. By extension, the same method of interpretation can be used for a Muslim to see the validity of the claims of the Báb. The second and longer part of the book is the substantive discourse and deals with specific proofs, both theological and logical, of the mission of the Báb. One of the best-known passages of this part is known as the &quot;Tablet of the True Seeker&quot;.

While Baháʼu&#x27;lláh had claimed to have received a revelation some ten years earlier in the Síyáh-Chál (lit. &quot;black pit&quot;), a dungeon in Tehran, he had not yet openly declared his mission. References to his own station in the Baháʼí Faith as a Manifestation of God therefore appear only in veiled form. Christopher Buck, author of a major study of the &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot;, has referred to this theme of the book as its &quot;messianic secret&quot;, paralleling the same theme in the Gospel of Mark in the Christian New Testament.

Shoghi Effendi gave the following lengthy description of the book&#x27;s content:Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims unequivocally the existence and oneness of a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty; asserts the relativity of religious truth and the continuity of Divine Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, the universality of their Message, the identity of their fundamental teachings, the sanctity of their scriptures, and the twofold character of their stations; denounces the blindness and perversity of the divines and doctors of every age; cites and elucidates the allegorical passages of the New Testament, the abstruse verses of the Quran, and the cryptic Muhammadan traditions which have bred those age-long misunderstandings, doubts and animosities that have sundered and kept apart the followers of the world&#x27;s leading religious systems; enumerates the essential prerequisites for the attainment by every true seeker of the object of his quest; demonstrates the validity, the sublimity and significance of the Báb&#x27;s Revelation; acclaims the heroism and detachment of His disciples; foreshadows, and prophesies the world-wide triumph of the Revelation promised to the people of the Bayán; upholds the purity and innocence of the Virgin Mary; glorifies the Imams of the Faith of Muhammad; celebrates the martyrdom, and lauds the spiritual sovereignty, of the Imam Husayn; unfolds the meaning of such symbolic terms as &quot;Return,&quot; &quot;Resurrection,&quot; &quot;Seal of the Prophets&quot; and &quot;Day of Judgment&quot;; adumbrates and distinguishes between the three stages of Divine Revelation; and expatiates, in glowing terms, upon the glories and wonders of the &quot;City of God,&quot; renewed, at fixed intervals, by the dispensation of Providence, for the guidance, the benefit and salvation of all mankind. Well may it be claimed that of all the books revealed by the Author of the Baháʼí Revelation, this Book alone, by sweeping away the age-long barriers that have so insurmountably separated the great religions of the world, has laid down a broad and unassailable foundation for the complete and permanent reconciliation of their followers.

== Significance ==

The &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; is the major theological work of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, and hence of the Baháʼí Faith. It is sometimes referred to as the completion of the &quot;Persian Bayán&quot;. Shoghi Effendi, head of the Baháʼí Faith from 1921 to 1957, referred to the work as follows:

A model of Persian prose, of a style at once original, chaste and vigorous, and remarkably lucid, both cogent in argument and matchless in its irresistible eloquence, this Book, setting forth in outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God, occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire range of Baháʼí literature, except the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot;, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s Most Holy Book.

<text>France Prešeren () (3 December 1800 – 8 February 1849) was a 19th-century Romantic Slovene poet whose poems have been translated into many languages.

He has been considered the greatest Slovene classical poet and has inspired later Slovene literature. He wrote the first Slovene ballad and the first Slovene epic. After his death, he became the leading name of the Slovene literary canon.

He tied together the motifs of his own unhappy love with that of an unhappy, subjugated homeland. Especially after World War II in the Slovene Lands, one of Prešeren&#x27;s motifs, the &quot;hostile fortune&quot;, has been adopted by Slovenes as a national myth, and Prešeren has been described being as ubiquitous as the air in Slovene culture.

Prešeren lived in conflict with both the civil and religious establishment, as well as with the provincial bourgeoisie of Ljubljana. He developed severe alcoholism and tried to kill himself on at least two occasions, facing rejections and seeing most of his closest friends die tragically. His lyric poetry dealt with the love towards his homeland, the suffering humanity, as well as his unfulfilled love towards his muse, Julija Primic.

He wrote poetry primarily in Slovene, but also in German. He lived in Carniola and at first regarded himself a Carniolan, but gradually adopted a broader Slovene identity.

==Life==

=== Early life and education ===

France Prešeren was born in the Upper Carniolan village of Vrba, then part of the Habsburg monarchy (today in Slovenia), as the third of eight children and the first son in the family of a well-off farmer and an ambitious and better educated mother who taught her children to write and read and soon sent them to their uncles who were Roman Catholic priests.

At the age of eight, he was sent to elementary schools in Grosuplje and Ribnica, run by the local Roman Catholic clergy. In 1812, he moved to the Carniolan provincial capital of Ljubljana, where he attended the State Gymnasium. He learned Latin, Ancient Greek, and German, which was then the language of education, administration, and high culture in most areas inhabited by Slovenes.

In Ljubljana, Prešeren&#x27;s the poet Valentin Vodnik encouraged him to develop his literary skills in Slovene. As a high school student, he became friends with the future philologist Matija Čop.

In 1821, Prešeren enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law. In Vienna, he studied the western canon including Homer, Goethe, Dante, and the Italian trecentists, especially Petrarch and Boccaccio. He also read contemporary Romantic poets, and he was fired from a teaching post at Klinkowström&#x27;s Jesuit institute for having lent a booklet of banned poetry to his friend Anastasius Grün.

=== Later life ===

After acquiring a law degree in 1828, he returned to Ljubljana, where he was employed as an assistant in the firm of the lawyer Leopold Baumgartner. He constantly strove to become an independent lawyer, filing as many as six applications, but he was not successful. In 1832, he briefly moved to Klagenfurt in the hope of furthering his career, but returned to Ljubljana after less than a year. In the spring of 1833, in the morning of 6 April, Easter Saturday, he supposedly met Julija Primic, the daughter of a rich merchant, who would become the unfulfilled love of his life. In 1833, he became a member of the Ljubljana high society&#x27;s social club, called the &quot;Casino Society&quot; (, ), and met Julija in 1834 and 1835 at the theatre and at the dances at the Casino Building, but did not have the courage to directly show her his feelings towards her. In 1834, he began working as an assistant to his friend Blaž Crobath, who gave Prešeren enough free time to engage in his literary activities. In the same year, he met the Czech romantic poet Karel Hynek Mácha and the Slovene-born Croatian poet Stanko Vraz and had long and fruitful discussions on poetry with them.

Around 1836, Prešeren finally realized that his love for Julija would never become mutual (she had married another man the previous year). The same year, he met Ana Jelovšek, with whom he entered into a permanent relationship. They had three children, but never married. Prešeren supported Ana financially and treated her as his rightful mate, but engaged in several other love affairs at the same time. He also spent a lot of time travelling throughout Carniola, especially to Lake Bled, from the scenery of which he drew inspiration for his poems. In 1846, Prešeren was finally allowed to open his own law firm and moved to Kranj with his family. He died there on 8 February 1849. Upon his deathbed he confessed that he had never forgotten Julija.

==Work==

===Early years===
Prešeren&#x27;s first serious poetic attempts date from his student years in Vienna. In 1824, he wrote some of his most popular poems, still under the influence of Valentin Vodnik and the rich tradition of Slovene folk poetry. In 1825, he completed a collection of &quot;Carniolan poems,&quot; which he showed to the philologist Jernej Kopitar. Kopitar was very critical of the young man&#x27;s literary attempts, and so Prešeren destroyed the entire collection. Kopitar&#x27;s rejection hindered the development of Prešeren&#x27;s creativity; he did not publish anything more until 1827, when his satirical poem &quot;To Maidens&quot; (&quot;Dekletom&quot;) was published by the German-language newspaper (Illyrian News). In 1828, Prešeren wrote his first important poem, &quot;A Farewell to Youth.&quot; However, it was published only in 1830, in the literary almanac &quot;Krajnska čbelica&quot; (The Carniolan Bee), established the same year by the librarian Miha Kastelic in Ljubljana. The journal published another well-known poem by Prešeren that year, the first Slovene ballad. It was titled &quot;The Water Man&quot; () and was a narration about Urška, a flirt from Ljubljana that ended in the hands of a handsome man who happened to be a water man.

In 1830, his friend from high school, Matija Čop, returned to Ljubljana and re-established contacts with Prešeren. Čop soon recognized his friend&#x27;s poetic talent and persuaded him to adopt Romanic poetic forms. Following Čop&#x27;s advice, Prešeren would soon become a master of the sonnet. His poems were noticed by the Czech scholar František Čelakovský, who published several highly positive critiques of it. Čelakovský&#x27;s praise was extremely important for Prešeren&#x27;s self-esteem and gave him the strength to continue in the path on which Čop had orientated him.

===The most productive years===
Between 1830 and 1835, Prešeren composed his esthetically most accomplished poems, which were inspired by the setbacks in his personal life, especially by his unrequited love for Julija Primic. Prešeren followed Čop&#x27;s advice and transformed Julija into a poetic figure, reminiscent of Dante&#x27;s Beatrice and Petrarch&#x27;s Laura.

====&quot;A Wreath of Sonnets&quot;====

&quot;A Wreath of Sonnets&quot; () is Prešeren&#x27;s most important poem from his early period. It is a crown of 15 sonnets. It was published on 22 February 1834 in the &quot;Illyrian Paper&quot;. In it, Prešeren tied together the motifs of his own unhappy love with that of an unhappy, subjugated homeland. The poem was recognized as a masterpiece by Matija Čop, but it did not gain much recognition beyond the small circle around the journal &quot;Krajnska čbelica&quot;. Moreover, Julija was unimpressed. Understandably, Prešeren moved to more bitter verses.

====&quot;Sonnets of Misfortune&quot;====

Another important work from this period are the &quot;Sonnets of Misfortune&quot; (&quot;Sonetje nesreče&quot;), which were first drafted already in 1832, but were published in the 4th volume of &quot;Krajnska čbelica&quot; only in July 1834, with some changes. They are the most pessimistic of Prešeren&#x27;s works. This is a group of six (initially seven) sonnets expressing the poet&#x27;s despair over life. In the first sonnet, titled &quot;O Vrba,&quot; Prešeren reflects on what his life could have been like, had he never left his home village. The other sonnets from the circle have not gained such a widespread popularity, but are still considered by scholars to be among Prešeren&#x27;s most genuine and profound works.

===After Čop&#x27;s death===
1835 was Prešeren&#x27;s &quot;annus horibilis&quot;. His closest friend Matija Čop drowned while swimming in the Sava River, Julija Primic married a wealthy merchant, and Prešeren became alienated from his friend and editor of the literary journal &quot;Krajnska čbelica&quot;, Miha Kastelic. Following his best friend&#x27;s death, Prešeren wrote the epic-lyric poem &quot;The Baptism on the Savica&quot; (), dedicating it to Čop. Set during the forced Christianisation of the predecessors of Slovenes, the Carantanians, in the late 8th century, the poem addresses the issues of collective identity and faithfulness to the ancestors&#x27; ways, as well as the issue of individual and his hope and resignation. The philosopher Slavoj Žižek interpreted the poem as an example of the emergence of modern subjectivity.

In 1837, Prešeren met Emil Korytko, a Polish political activist from Galicia, confined by the Austrian authorities to Ljubljana. Korytko introduced to Prešeren the work of Adam Mickiewicz, which had an important influence on his later works. The two even jointly translated one of Mickiewicz&#x27;s poems (&quot;Resygnacja&quot;) from Polish to Slovene and started collecting Slovene folk songs in Carniola and Lower Styria. In 1839, Korytko died, leaving Prešeren without an important interlocutor after Čop&#x27;s death.

In the autumn of the same year, Andrej Smole, one of Prešeren&#x27;s friends from his youth, returned home after many years of living and travelling abroad. Smole was a relatively rich young intellectual from a well-established merchant family, who supported the development of Slovene culture. The two spent much of the winter of 1839–1840 on Smole&#x27;s estate in Lower Carniola, where they planned several cultural and literary projects, including the establishment of a daily newspaper in Slovene and the publishing of Anton Tomaž Linhart&#x27;s comedy &quot;Matiček&#x27;s Wedding&quot; which had been prohibited as &quot;politically inappropriate&quot; in 1790, due to the outbreak of the French Revolution. Both projects failed: the planned journal &quot;Ilirske novice&quot; was blocked by the Viennese censorship, and Linhart&#x27;s play would be staged only in 1848, without Prešeren&#x27;s assistance. Smole died suddenly in 1840, literally in Prešeren&#x27;s arms, while celebrating his 40th birthday. Prešeren dedicated a touching, yet unexpectedly cheerful and vitalist poem to his late friend.

===The later years===

After 1840, Prešeren was left without any interlocutor who could appreciate his works, but continued to write poetry, although much less than in the 1830s. He gradually departed from the typical romantic trend, adopting an increasingly diverse and innovative style. In 1843, an important breakthrough for Prešeren happened: Janez Bleiweis started publishing a new daily journal in Slovene and invited Prešeren to participate in its cultural section. The two men came from rather different backgrounds: Bleiweis was a moderate conservative and staunch supporter of the ecclesiastical and imperial establishments and alien to the Romantic culture. He nevertheless established a fair relationship with the poet. Prešeren&#x27;s participation in Bleiweis&#x27; editorial project was the closest he would come to public recognition during his lifetime.

In 1844, he wrote the patriotic poem &quot;Zdravljica&quot; (A Toast), the most important achievement of his late period. In 1847, a volume of his collected poems was published under the simple title &quot;Poezije dr. Franceta Prešerna&quot; (Poems of Dr. France Prešeren).

Prešeren spent the last two years of his life occupied with private life and his new job as a lawyer in Kranj. According to some accounts, he was planning several literary projects, including a novel in the realistic style and an experimental play, but he was struck with liver disease caused by his excessive drinking in prior years. The revolution of 1848 left him rather indifferent, although it was carried out by the young generation who already saw him as an idol of democratic and national ideals. Before his death, he did however redact his &quot;Zdravljica&quot;, which was left out from the 1847 volume of poems, and made some minor adjustments for a new edition of his collected poems.

==Reception and influence==
Today, Prešeren is still considered one of the leading poets of Slovene literature, acclaimed not only nationally or regionally, but also according to the standards of developed European literature. Prešeren was one of the greatest European Romanticists. His fervent, heartfelt lyrics, intensely emotional but never merely sentimental, have made him the chief representative of the Romantic school in Slovenia.

Nevertheless, recognition came slowly after his death. It was not before 1866 that a real breakthrough in the reception of his role in Slovene culture took place. In that year, Josip Jurčič and Josip Stritar published a new edition of Prešeren&#x27;s collection of poems. In the preface, Stritar published an essay which is still considered one of the most influential essays in Slovene history. In it, he showed the aesthetic value of Prešeren&#x27;s work by placing him in the wider European context. From then on, his reputation as the greatest poet in Slovene was never endangered.

==Legacy==

Prešeren&#x27;s legacy in Slovene culture is enormous. He is generally regarded as the national poet. In 1905, his monument was placed at the central square in Ljubljana, now called Prešeren Square. By the early 1920s, all his surviving work had been catalogued and numerous critical editions of his works had been published. Several scholars were already dealing exclusively with the analysis of his work and little was left unknown about his life. Slovene composer Breda Šček set his works to music. In 1945, the anniversary of his death, called Prešeren Day, was declared as the Slovene cultural holiday. In 1989, his &quot;Zdravljica&quot; was declared the national anthem of Slovenia, replacing the old &quot;Naprej, zastava slave&quot;. In 1992, his effigy was portrayed on the Slovene 1000 tolar banknote, and since 2007, his image is on the Slovene two-euro coin. The highest Slovene prize for artistic achievements, the Prešeren Award, is named after him.

<text>Martial of Limoges (3rd century), whose name is also rendered as Marcial, Martialis, and Marcialis, and is also called &quot;the Apostle of the Gauls&quot; or &quot;the Apostle of Aquitaine,&quot; was the first bishop of Limoges. Venerated as a Christian saint, Martial of Limoges is considered to have been canonized Pre-Congregation, and his feast day is on 30 June.

He appears on the Limoges coat of arms.

==Life==
There is no accurate information as to the origin, dates of birth and death, or the acts of this bishop, although he is said to have come from the &quot;East.&quot; According to Gregory of Tours, during the time of the Emperors Decius Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. According to the Golden Legend, when Martial first went to Limoges as a missionary, he visited the temple, where the priests beat him before having him imprisoned. During his morning prayers the following day, a great light surrounded him and the bars and chains burst open, releasing Martial and resulting in the prison guards requesting to be baptised by him. He succeeded in converting the inhabitants to Christianity, and his memory has always been venerated there.

==Abbey==

Martial died in Limoges and was buried outside the Roman town. As his tomb became progressively more important as a pilgrimage site, the monks found patronage in the Benedictine order in the 9th century. The site became the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Martial, a great library (second only to the library at Cluny) and scriptorium. The 12th-century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois worked in its library.

The Abbey of Saint-Martial, one of the great pilgrimage churches of western Christianity, was so thoroughly razed in the 19th century, that only the scattered manuscripts of its library remain. Some of said manuscripts had been bought for Louis XV and have come to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The original crypt was exhumed in 1966–1970. Twelve Romanesque carved capitals were discovered built into the foundations of a barn and purchased in 1994 for the Museum of the Bishopric of Limoges.

==Hagiography==
The &quot;Miracula Martialis&quot;, an account of 7th-, 8th- and 9th-century miracles, was written shortly after 854.

The influx of pilgrims to the abbey where the historical Martial lay buried encouraged the creation of an elaborate hagiography during the 10th century. As the hagiography grew, Martial was moved back in time: now, sent into Gaul by Peter himself, he is said to have evangelized not only the Province of Limoges but all of Aquitaine. He performed many miracles, among others the raising of a dead man to life, by touching him with a rod that Peter had given him.

The mythology culminated in the 11th century forgeries of Ademar of Chabannes, The &quot;Life of St. Martial&quot;, attributed to Bishop Aurelian, his successor, which was designed to &#x27;prove&#x27; that Martial had been baptized by Peter, was one of the seventy-two disciples and present at the Last Supper.

In the 13th century compendium of lore, the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, the legendary Martial appears with many miracles, casting out fiends and raising the dead and conducting mass baptisms.

In the midst of a revival of his cult in the 14th century, 73 miracles were recorded between 1378 and 1388 in the &quot;Miracula sancti Martialis anno 1388 patrata&quot;.

As late as 1854, Mons. Buissas, Bishop of Limoges, petitioned Pope Pius IX to bestow on Martial the honors of a disciple of Christ, but was turned down. The full discovery of Ademar&#x27;s tissue of forged documents, including an imaginary church council and a papal letter, was not revealed until the 1920s, and continued for several generations to be resisted in conservative Catholic circles.

Martial is also associated with Valerie of Limoges, a martyr of the 3rd or 4th centuries, who is said to have carried her head to him after her decapitation.

==Veneration==
His help was invoked during an epidemic of widespread ergot poisoning in Limoges in 994. Martial was particularly honored in Bordeaux, where his pastoral staff was kept in the Basilica Saint-Seurin and used in processions to invoke his aid during outbreaks of pestilence. He is a popular saint throughout Limousin. He is also venerated in Italy, where Colle di Val d&#x27;Elsa Cathedral is dedicated to him.

Aside from ergotism, he is generally invoked against epidemics; he is also a patron saint of prisoners. As a patron saint of places, Limoges, Avignon, and Cahors all enjoy his patronage.

The Cloisters has a 12th-century stained-glass window of &quot;Saint Martial Founding the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre.&quot;

 was used for deliberations during conclaves. , a Gothic church in Avignon, was completed in 1402.

In Brazilian folklore, he is celebrated with bonfires on the day of his liturgical feast which closes the Festas Juninas in Maranhão. In São Luís, in 2007, a monument was erected in his honor, given the popularity of his festivities, held in the city since 1928, and which annually gather thousands of people, in the Festejo de São Pedro e São Marçal, with the celebrations of the bumba-meu-boi.

<doc id="335647" wikidata="Q747927" url="?curid=335647" title="Geography of Serbia">
<text>Serbia is a small country situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the far southern edges of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. It shares borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Romania. Serbia shares a contested border with Albania as it doesn&#x27;t recognise the independence of Kosovo. Serbia is landlocked, though it is able to access the Adriatic Sea through Montenegro and inland Europe and the Black Sea via the Danube.

==Area and borders==
Arable land covers (%), and forests cover (%) of the territory of Serbia.

Serbia&#x27;s total border length amounts to : with Kosovo 380.6 km (146.9 mi), with Bosnia and Herzegovina , with Bulgaria , with Croatia , with Hungary , with North Macedonia , with Montenegro , with Romania, .

;Extreme points:
* North: 46°11&#x27;25&quot; N (near Hajdukovo)
* South: 41°51&#x27;08&quot; N (near Rastelica)
* East: 23°00&#x27;47&quot; E (Senokos near Dimitrovgrad)
* West: 18°49&#x27;16&quot; E (near Bezdan in West bačka, Serbia)

==Physical geography==

===Topography===

Serbia&#x27;s terrain ranges from fertile plains of northern Vojvodina to limestone ranges and basins in the east and ancient mountains and hills in the southeast. The north is dominated by the Danube River. The Morava River, a tributary of the Danube, flows through the more mountainous southern regions of Serbia.

The terrain of central Serbia consists chiefly of hills and low to medium-high mountains, interspersed with numerous rivers and creeks. The main communication and development line stretches southeast of Belgrade towards Niš and Skopje (in North Macedonia), along the valley formed by the Great and South Morava rivers. Most major cities, as well as the main railroad and highway, are located on or around this line. To the east of this line, in an area that is relatively sparsely populated, the terrain rises to the limestone ranges of Stara Planina and the Serbian Carpathians. To the west, mountains slowly rise towards the southwest, but do not form real ridges. Zlatibor and Kopaonik are the highest mountains of this area. 

Mountains cover the largest parts of the country. Four mountain systems meet in Serbia: the Dinaric Alps in the west cover the greatest territory, stretching from northwest to southeast. The Carpathian and Balkan Mountains stretch in a north–south direction in eastern Serbia, east of the Morava valley. Ancient mountains along the South Morava, the highest one being Besna Kobila, belong to the Rila-Rhodope mountain system.

The most significant mountains in Serbia are:
* Kopaonik
* Stara Planina
* Mokra Gora
* Besna Kobila
* Dukat
* Golija
* Suva Planina
* Gramada
* Tara
* Zlatibor

The highest peak in Serbia is Midžor with 2169m.
===Hydrology===

Practically the entire territory (92%) of Serbia belongs to the Danube (Black Sea) drainage basin.

The Danube flows 588 km through Serbia or as a border river (with Croatia in the northwest and Romania in the southeast). Other chief rivers in Serbia are tributaries of the Danube including the Sava (flowing from the west), Tisa (flowing from the north), Drina (flowing from the south, forming a natural border with Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Morava. Only the Morava flows nearly entirely through Serbia. Their tributaries form a dense network of smaller rivers and creeks that cover most of the country.

Due to its terrain, natural lakes in Serbia are sparse and small and most are located in Vojvodina, such as the glacial lake Palić and numerous oxbow lakes along rivers. There are, however, numerous artificial lakes, mostly due to the construction of hydroelectric dams, the biggest being Đerdap on the Danube, Perućac on the Drina, and Vlasina Lake.

The abundance of relatively unpolluted surface water and numerous underground water sources of high quality might present opportunities for exportation and economic improvement. Extensive exploitation and production of bottled water has begun only recently. Despite the country&#x27;s access to these water resources, water supply to many Serbian cities is poor due to mismanagement and a lack of adequate investment in infrastructure. This is complicated by water pollution (e.g., pollution in the Ibar River from Trepča zinc-lead compounds affecting Kraljevo and the presence of natural arsenic in underground waters in Zrenjanin).

The theoretical hydroenergetic potential in Serbia is estimated to be around 17,000 GWh. Roughly 10,000 GWh or 60% of Serbia&#x27;s hydroenergetic potential is generated by large power plants. The remainder could be generated in small and medium power plants (&lt;25 MW), whose construction by the private sector may improve Serbia&#x27;s economy and energy reliability.

Serbia also has a huge geothermal potential, but it is only partially and sporadically accessed. Geothermal water is primarily used for balneological purposes: there are around 60 spas in Serbia, which are seen as an opportunity to improve tourism in the country.

===Climate===

Climate of Serbia is moderate continental with a diversity on local level, caused by geographic location, relief, terrain exposition, presence of river and lake systems, vegetation, urbanization etc. Proximity of the mountain ranges of Alps, Carpathians, Rhodopes, as well as Adriatic Sea and Pannonian plain affect the climate. Location of river ravines and plains in the northern area of the country enable occasional deep southward protrusion of polar air masses on winters, while hot Saharan air often intrudes over the Mediterranean Sea on summers.

Average annual air temperature for the period 1961-1990 for the area with the altitude of up to amounts to . The areas with the altitudes of have average annual temperature of around , and over of altitude around .

Annual precipitation, generally, rises with altitude. In lower regions, it ranges in the interval from , areas on altitude over receive in average , and some mountainous summits in southwestern Serbia up to . Major part of Serbia has continental precipitation regimen, with peak in the earlier summer period, except for southwest, which receives highest precipitation autumn. May–June is the rainiest month, with the average of 12 to 13% of total annual amount. February and October have the least precipitation. Snow cover can occurs from late November to early March, and majority of days with snow cover is in January.

Annual sums of solar radiation are in the interval from 1500 to 2200 hours annually.

Surface air circulation is largely influenced by orographic lift. In warmer part of the year, winds from northwest and west prevail. In Vojvodina and Sumadija, east-southeast wind, Košava, dominates over autumn and winter. Southwestern winds prevail in mountainous part of southwestern Serbia.

===Biodiversity===

Serbia has five national parks and many national nature reserves encompassing 5% of the territory.

;National parks:
* Đerdap: (Iron Gate) 
* Tara: 
* Kopaonik: 
* Fruška Gora: 

;Nature parks:
* Stara Planina 
* Golija 
* Kučajske planine 
* Gornje Podunavlje 
;Special nature reservations:
* Deliblato Sands 
* Ludaš Lake 
* Obedska Pond 
* Stari Begej – Carska Bara 

;Nature monuments:
* Đavolja Varoš

<text>Robert Havemann (; 11 March 1910 – 9 April 1982) was an East German chemist and dissident.

==Life and career==

He studied chemistry in Berlin and Munich from 1929 to 1933, and then later received a doctorate in physical chemistry from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.

Havemann joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1932 and was one of the founders of the resistance group, European Union. It was in connection with this group that he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943. He received a death sentence for treason, but his execution was continually postponed because of the intervention of former colleagues, who insisted that Havemann was as important due to his work on chemical weapons and that he was still needed to explain the research. His execution was postponed so many times, he was able to survive until the Brandenburg-Görden Prison was liberated by the Red Army.

After the war, he became head of administration in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin, but in 1948 he was dismissed from this position due to political pressure from the American authorities in West Berlin. He continued his scientific work in the institute until he got barred from his laboratory in January 1950. 

He then became a professor of physical chemistry at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He became a member of the Volkskammer in 1950 and won one of the GDR&#x27;s national prizes in 1959. He published articles in &quot;Sinn und Form&quot; criticizing modern socialism and revisionist works of the Western authors.

In 1963 he lectured on &#x27;Scientific Aspects of Philosophical Problems&#x27; (published as &#x27;Dialectic without Dogmatism—Natural Sciences against Communistic Ideology&#x27;) and was expelled from the ruling Socialist Unity Party and dismissed from the University—officially because he gave an interview to a newspaper from West Germany.

His son Florian Havemann (born 12 January 1952 in East Berlin) fled to West Germany in 1971.

Havemann was a victim of the Stasi&#x27;s psychological warfare program.

He continued his work as a socialist critic and was put under house arrest in 1976, at his home in the village of Grünheide. This continued until his death in 1982, after a long time suffering from lung disease.

In 1989 he was politically rehabilitated by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany&#x27;s Central Party Control Commission.

In 2005, Havemann was awarded the title Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem.

<text>The Mindbenders were an English beat group from Manchester. Originally the backing group for Wayne Fontana, they were one of several acts that were successful in the mid-1960s British Invasion of the US charts, achieving major chart hits with &quot;The Game of Love&quot; (a number-one single with Fontana) in 1965 and &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; in 1966.

== Career ==
Wayne Fontana founded the band in June 1963 with Bob Lang, Ric Rothwell, and Eric Stewart. The name of the group was inspired by the title of a 1963 UK feature film, starring the British actor Dirk Bogarde, called &quot;The Mind Benders&quot;. Before that Fontana had a group called Wayne Fontana and the Jets (from July 1962). Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders released a number of singles before recording &quot;Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um&quot; in 1964, which was to be their first major hit in Britain and led to a tour with Brenda Lee. They also had a No.1 hit in the United States with &quot;The Game of Love&quot; in 1965 (which also reached No.2 on the UK singles chart). The band&#x27;s self-titled album reached No. 18 in the UK.

After a tour of America and two more singles that were less successful than &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Little Bit Too Late&quot; and &quot;She Needs Love&quot;, Fontana left the band in the middle of a concert in 1965. The Mindbenders decided to carry on as a trio—Stewart was the primary lead singer and guitarist, Lang played bass, and Rothwell was the drummer. Both Lang and Rothwell sang backing vocals, and took the occasional lead vocal on album tracks.

The Mindbenders&#x27; first single without Fontana was the hit &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; (a Carole Bayer Sager / Toni Wine composition). The song reached No. 2 in the US (No. 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; singles chart) and No. 2 in the UK in 1966. It sold one million copies globally. The Mindbenders&#x27; 1966 album of the same name managed to reach No. 28 in the UK.

A second song by Bayer and Wine, &quot;Can&#x27;t Live With You (Can&#x27;t Live Without You)&quot;, had struggled to break the UK Top 30 while the third one, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, took the Mindbenders to No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart in the autumn of 1966.

On 4 July 1966, the Mindbenders began their United States tour in Atlanta, Georgia in front of a capacity 25,000 crowd as the support act for James Brown. It would be their only tour of the United States as The Mindbenders, &quot;i.e.&quot;, without Fontana. Stewart recalled that &quot;we went down quite well&quot;, but that later shows at the Fillmore West Auditorium on Friday 8 July and Saturday 9 July 1966 were more memorable. &quot;The liquid light show was great and really worked with our act, which was a lot heavier than on our records.&quot;

In September/October 1966 they embarked on a 12 date package tour of England backing Dave Berry of &#x27;The Crying Game&#x27; fame. The tour also included Dusty Springfield and The Alan Price Set.

Stewart was developing himself as a songwriter, and wrote &quot;My New Day and Age&quot; for Family. However, the Mindbenders generally sought material from outside the band, with only a handful of B-sides and album tracks being written by Stewart, occasionally in collaboration with Lang and Rothwell.

The band&#x27;s next project was a loose sort of concept album, several months before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Tommy&quot; were issued. However, The Mindbenders’ release &quot;With Woman in Mind&quot; really had no overarching narrative or story, the &#x27;concept&#x27; being simply songs written about relationships with women. The album contained &quot;I Want Her, She Wants Me&quot; (written by Rod Argent of The Zombies), &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, and the lascivious &quot;Schoolgirl&quot; (written by Graham Gouldman). The album did not sell well and was not even released in the United States. The accompanying single, another Bayer/Wine composition, &quot;We&#x27;ll Talk About It Tomorrow&quot; also flopped.

The Mindbenders appeared in the 1967 Sidney Poitier movie, &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; and were also on the soundtrack with the songs &quot;Off and Running&quot; (the last Bayer/Wine song recorded by the band) and &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Harder All the Time&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Rothwell quit the band and was replaced by Paul Hancox. Graham Gouldman became the band&#x27;s producer around this time; future Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones was also involved in arranging their records in 1967/68.

Later in 1967, The Mindbenders released their cover version of &quot;The Letter&quot; which fell short at No. 42 in the UK singles chart (the last time The Mindbenders registered a single in the UK charts), whilst The Box Tops original reached the UK Top 10. A couple more flops followed and in March 1968, Lang quit and was replaced by Graham Gouldman. With Gouldman on bass, but with Ric Dixon producing, the band recorded Gouldman&#x27;s composition &quot;Uncle Joe, the Ice Cream Man&quot; as their final single.

On 20 November 1968, The Mindbenders broke up at the final concert of a UK tour with The Who, Arthur Brown and Joe Cocker.

===Aftermath===
Stewart and Gouldman played together in Hotlegs and later went on to form 10cc.

Lang later joined another rock music outfit, Racing Cars. Lang did not play with the band for long, however, and did not feature on any of their recordings. They had one hit single, &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, which reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1977.

<text>Arthur Judson Brown (December 3, 1856 – January 11, 1963) was an American clergyman, missionary and author.

Brown was born in Holliston, Massachusetts, and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1883. Brown preached in various cities throughout the United States, including Portland, Oregon and Oak Park, Illinois from 1883 to 1895. 

Often termed a &quot;missionary statesman,&quot; Brown traveled throughout the world—most notably in China and other Asian countries. During the time Brown surveyed China, he wrote a seventeen-volume diary of what he&#x27;d seen and discovered. Over time, Brown communicated with Roman Catholic, Jewish, and Greek Orthodox leaders, in addition to such influential Protestant clergymen as Henry Sloane Coffin, Nathan Söderblom, and John R. Mott. Brown himself received letters from five American Presidents and various other government officials. Booker T. Washington, John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1839–1937), and John Wanamaker were among his famous American correspondents. In addition, members of European and Asian royalty, including Chinese general and self-proclaimed emperor, Yuan Shikai, were in communication with Brown. 

Overall, Brown will be remembered as a pioneer in the ecumenical and world missionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries and was an individual who was active in and out of the church. He served in a plethora of notable positions. The following is a lengthy chronology of Brown&#x27;s achievements and activities. During this time Brown also preached at various churches.
Arthur Judson Brown died in New York City in 1963, 39 days after celebrating his 106th birthday. He was subsequently buried in Orange, New Jersey.

<doc id="335669" wikidata="Q4267" url="?curid=335669" title="Adémar de Chabannes">
<text>Adémar de Chabannes (988/989 – 1034; also Adhémar de Chabannes) was a French/Frankish monk, active as a composer, scribe, historian, poet, grammarian and literary forger. He was associated with the Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges, where he was a central figure in the Saint Martial school, an important center of early medieval music. Much of his career was spent copying and transcribing earlier accounts of Frankish history; his major work was the &quot;Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Aquitaine and France&quot;).

He is well-known for forging a &quot;Vita&quot;, purportedly by Aurelian of Limoges, that indicated Saint Martial was one of the original apostles, and for composing an associated Mass for Saint Martial. Though he successfully convinced the local bishop and abbot of its authenticity, the traveling monk Benedict of Chiusa exposed his forgery and damaged Adémar&#x27;s reputation.
==Life and career==
Besides perhaps Guillaume de Machaut, more is known about the life of Adémar than any other medieval composer. Part of this was from the well-recorded notoriety he would achieve from various infamous events, but also because the Abbey in which he worked preserved a huge amount of his literary and musical manuscripts. Unlike other documents there, the Adémar collection was later purchased by Louis XV, and thus spared from the substantial destruction of documents there during the French Revolution.

Adémar was born at Chabannes, a village in today&#x27;s Haute-Vienne &quot;département&quot; of France. Educated at the Abbey Saint-Martial de Limoges, he passed his life as a monk both there and at the monastery of Saint-Cybard at Angoulême. Adémar died around 1034, most probably at Jerusalem, where he had gone on a pilgrimage.

==Works==

=== Adémar as chronicler ===

Adémar&#x27;s life was mainly spent in writing and transcribing chant books and chronicles, and his principal work is a history entitled &quot;Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum&quot; or &quot;Historia Francorum&quot;. This is in three books and deals with Frankish history from the reign of Pharamond, king of the Franks, to 1028. The first two books are scarcely more than a copy of earlier histories of Frankish kings, such as the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, the &quot;Continuation&quot; of Fredegar and the &quot;Annales regni Francorum&quot;. The third book, which deals with the period from 814 to 1028, is of considerable historical importance. It relies partly on the &quot;Chronicon Aquitanicum&quot;, to which Adémar himself added a final notice for the year 1028.

=== Cantor, hymnographer and notator ===
When Adémar joined the Abbey Saint Martial of Limoges, he was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes, cantor of the Abbey between 1010 until his death in 1025. Adémar apparently succeeded his uncle as cantor on his death. 

Adémar contributed as a notator to the Abbey&#x27;s existing chant books learning from his uncle and other manuscripts where he contributed important parts, especially his own compositions. Adémar composed his own musical Mass and Office in the forms developed by the local school of his uncle Roger, using modal patterns documented in the tonaries of the new troper-prosers, a chant book organised in libellum structure which separated the contents into collections dedicated to chant genres, especially innovative ones such as tropus and sequence and the elaborated chant of the offertorium. This libellum type was rather extravagant and carefully made by collecting a range of individual contributions.

=== Adémar&#x27;s forgeries ===
He embraced the developing tale that Saint Martial, the third century bishop who Christianized the Limoges district, had actually lived centuries earlier, and was in fact one of the original apostles. And he supplemented the less than scanty documentation for the alleged &#x27;apostolicity&#x27; of Martial, first with a forged &quot;Life&quot; of Martial, as if composed by Martial&#x27;s successor, Bishop Aurelian. To effect this claim, he composed an &quot;Apostolic Mass&quot; that still exists in Adémar&#x27;s own hand. The local bishop and abbot seem to have cooperated in the project and the mass was first sung on Sunday, 3 August 1029.

Unfortunately for Adémar, the liturgy was disrupted by a travelling monk, Benedict of Chiusa, who denounced the improved &quot;Vita&quot; of Martial as a provincial forgery and the new liturgy as offensive to God. The word spread, and the promising young monk was disgraced. Adémar&#x27;s reaction was to build forgery upon forgery, inventing a Council of 1031 that confirmed the &#x27;apostolic&#x27; status of Martial, even a forged papal letter. 

In the long run, Adémar was successful. By the late 11th century, Martial was indeed venerated in Aquitaine as an apostle, though his legend was doubted elsewhere. The reality of this tissue of forgeries was only unravelled in the 1920s, by the historian Louis Saltet. Mainstream Catholic historians ignored Saltet&#x27;s revelations until the 1990s. 

== The Mass for Saint Martial ==
As an apostle, Saint Martial would be entitled to a substantial mass for the celebration of his feast day within a festal octave. Adémar therefore composed a series of hymns, providing both text and music due to his position as cantor at Saint Martial. This he did by troping, i.e. adding additional text to a number of pre-existing hymns and sequences, also providing proper mass chant for Saint Martial as apostle and patron of the Monastery. Following the libellum structure of the manuscript, the elements of the mass are not presented continuously, since the alleluia verses preceding the Gospel and offertories of the Mass were separated as &quot;little books&quot; (libelli), while the sequences are written in a third one. 

The apostolic mass composed for Saint Martial was exceptionally written unseparated but without the tropes, very likely later on some blank pages of the libellum with the troper of proper chant. The collection dedicated to the birth of the patron saint started separately with newly composed alleluia verses (f. 61&#x27;-62), office tropes for the same occasion (f. 62&#x27;-70), the whole untroped mass (f. 70&#x27;-71), tropes and processional antiphons (f. 71&#x27;-73&#x27;). It was a kind of addition, because the regular proprium tropes had been written already (f. 42-46&#x27;). 

* Introit «Probauit eum» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 70&#x27;).
* Gradual «Principes populorum» V. «Elegit dominus» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 70&#x27;-71)
* All «Alleluia» V. «Beati oculi» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 71).
* Offertorium «Diligo uirginitatem» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 71-71&#x27;)
** V1. «Praeceptum a domino»
** V2. «Designatus a domino»
* Communio «Nolite gaudere» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 71&#x27;)
* Sequence «Arce polorum» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 198-199&#x27;)
* Sequence «Apostolorum gloriosa» (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 199&#x27;-201&#x27;).
Finally, recognising the scale of the mass he as cantor had composed for the monastic community of Limoges Abbey, it needed to make clear that the local patron saint had now to be considered an apostle. Therefore the rubric said «De sancto apostolo Marciale».

=== Adémar&#x27;s technique as notator ===

These pages of the Troper-Sequentiary give not only evidence of Adémar&#x27;s skills as a hymnographer and composing cantor, they also show his sophisticated way as a notator of using custodes to help the reader&#x27;s orientation between the lines. The change to another line was preferably chosen where a certain unit like a membrum «Probauit | eum deus | et sci-[break to the third line]uit | cor suum» was complete, but not always. If the first note on the next line was expected on the same pitch, an &quot;e&quot; for &quot;equaliter&quot; as a so-called &quot;significant letter&quot; was set instead of a custos. The Aquitanian notation also had many agogic details, but could be written in a way that groupings would be still visible, even if a large interval separated them. In comparison with contemporary Italian neume notation which tried to display intervals by a vertical adjustment to represent visibly the difference in height like here, the groups always had to stick together and were difficult to write since the dots needed to be connected. Aquitanian neumes not only spared ink in comparison, but their ability to disconnect connected neumes was also much easier to write. It was an ingenious invention of Roger de Chabannes&#x27; generation and his nephew improved it, so that the manuscripts of their scriptorium were the finest written in Aquitaine. 

The only problem was to understand what was the church tone. Here similar to William of Volpiano&#x27;s method the tonary worked like a key. The psalmody was indicated afterwards and crucial was the so-called «differentia», the way it ended. At the end of the introit, there was the incipit of the psalm «Domine probasti me» (Ps 138) and the «differentia» was notated with the concluding small doxology «seculorum[.] amen[.]». As such it had to be looked up at the tonary dedicated to the psalmody of the Mass chant genre introit which started on folio 255 recto. Doing this, one finds the differentia in the section of «In primo thono authenti proti». Thus, one understands that the beginning means D re a mi―b fa etc., which was like a stereotype to begin and develop the proper melos of the Dorian church tone.

===The introit and Adémar as a composer of proper chant and its tropes ===

Adémar chose themes from Psalm 138 as his introit, the very same which was used in the related psalmody: 

but converted his paraphrasing antiphon to a less personal one than the psalm text:

By repeating the melody of the beginning over the last word of the verse «semitas | suas / deduxit illum», there is a kind of enjambement, because the musical form separates the word from its grammatical context and connects it with the next verse. The musical emphasis is on the word &quot;eternal&quot; with a melisma in the higher register. 

But as yet the text said nothing about the patron saint of Limoges, it was just paraphrasing some verses taken from Psalm 138. They needed to be embellished by additional tropes preceding each verse. And many of these tropes already existed by the time of Roger de Chabannes.

In the period of 80 years before Roger de Chabannes was cantor the number of tropes for this introitus had grown from three to seventeen. The three oldest tropes were «Haec est psallite» (in F-Pn lat. 1120 on folio 49 verso reworked with the beginning «Psallite omnes»), «Coronam sacerdocii» which follows the beginning of the old introit «Statuit ei dominus» and divides the second part of the first verse «Testamentum pacis», the trope continues «Quo uniti simus fide» etc. (reworked in F-Pn lat. 1120 on folio 49 verso with an introductory trope «Celsa polorum pontus»), the third trope is «Marcialis meriti».

Adémar obviously refined the local tradition and reduced the number of tropes. According to James Grier he added two tropes «Sanctus Marcialis» and «Christi discipulus» of his own composition, and reworked the first «Plebs devota deus» of this huge collection, to adapt the former celebration of the patron-saint as a bishop-confessor to his new role as an apostle. As one can see in the former Troper in F-Pn lat. 1120, the incipits of the former introit «Statuit ei dominus» were erased, but new incipits were copied for only two of seventeen tropes, as the redacting scribe tried to adapt the old collection to the text and meaning of the new introit. The very first trope «Plebs devota deus» did not have the new incipits, very likely because Adémar did not regard them as suitable; instead he recomposed the trope. The scribe did not continue his redaction for the rest of the collection, probably finding his efforts no longer useful, but fixed the collection in the tropers of F-Pn lat. 1121 and 909. This scribe was very likely Adémar who checked very carefully the change within the intertextual relationship and how the new meaning was generated between trope and antiphon. Thus, it is useful to study his adaption by comparing the version of this trope in the old introit (F-Pn lat. 1120, f. 46) with the revision, or rather the re-composition, of the new introit (F-Pn lat. 909, f. 42). 

From a grammatical and metrical point of view Adémar&#x27;s changes of the psalm verses seemed to have adapted the new introit «Probauit eum» to the former «Statuit ei», as if he tried re-troping the old antiphon (the neumes of the incipits show a vague resemblance), but it is clear that he also reworked the music carefully to the new text. Except for the last verse, the metric structure was almost identical: «Statuit» (14-8-11-4) and «Probavit» (13-8-11-14). 
This was the text of the old introit together with the old version of the trope «Plebs devota deo» (the additional troped text is in italics):

Adémar did not just change the following verses, he also changed slightly the end of the first line by replacing «sapientia fatur» by «sacra verba profantur». With the new antiphon paraphrasing psalm 138, there is a contrast between the mundane context of the trope and the scriptural context of the antiphon:


In Adémar&#x27;s older troper (F-Pn lat. 1121, f. 29) this revision had not yet been completed, and the incipits of the new antiphon had not yet been written from the second verse on. In his book James Grier (2006, 309) mentions that the scribe of a later Troper Sequentiary (F-Pn lat. 1119, f. 49&#x27;-50) simply combined both versions of the same trope with the new introit, so that a cantor had to decide between Pa 1121 and Pa 909. 

Although history shows that the plan to establish Saint Martial as an apostle succeeded, in the short-term the Mass itself was neglected. In particular after his death, when the Abbey Saint Martial came under Cluniac administration, the Gradual and its redaction of tropes and sequences (F-Pn lat. 1132), written about 1075, was conventionally organised and completely dismissed Adémar&#x27;s contribution to the local tradition of the Abbey Saint Martial in Limoges.

==Legacy==
James Grier, Professor of Music History in the Don Wright Faculty of Music at the University of Western Ontario, identifies Adémar as one of the first to write music using the musical notation still in use today. He placed the musical notes above the text, higher or lower according to the pitch: Professor Grier states that &quot;Placement on the vertical axis remains the standard convention for indicating pitch in notation in Western culture and there is far greater weight on pitch than on many other elements such as dynamics and timbre&quot;.

<text>In photography, reversal film or slide film is a type of photographic film that produces a positive image on a transparent base. Instead of negatives and prints, reversal film is processed to produce transparencies or diapositives (abbreviated as &quot;diafilm&quot; or &quot;dia&quot; in some languages like German, Romanian or Hungarian). Reversal film is produced in various sizes, from 35 mm to roll film to 8×10 inch sheet film.

A slide is a specially mounted individual transparency intended for projection onto a screen using a slide projector. This allows the photograph to be viewed by a large audience at once. The most common form is the 35 mm slide, with the image framed in a 2×2 inch cardboard or plastic mount. Some specialized labs produce photographic slides from digital camera images in formats such as JPEG, from computer-generated presentation graphics, and from a wide variety of physical source material such as fingerprints, microscopic sections, paper documents, astronomical images, etc.

Reversal film is sometimes used as motion picture film, mostly in the 16 mm, Super 8 and 8 mm &quot;cine&quot; formats, to yield a positive image on the camera original. This avoids the expense of using negative film, which requires additional film and processing to create a positive film print for projection.

==History==

===Additive method===
The earliest practical and commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumière Autochrome, introduced in 1907. It was an additive method, using a panchromatic emulsion coated on a thin glass plate previously coated with a layer of dyed potato starch grains. Autochrome plates were discontinued in the 1930s, after the introduction of Lumière Filmcolor in sheet film and Lumicolor in roll film sizes. Also using the additive principle and reversal processing were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961.

===Subtractive methods===

Leopold Godowsky, Jr. and Leopold Mannes, working with the Eastman Kodak Company, developed Kodachrome, the first commercially successful color film to use the subtractive method. Kodachrome was introduced in 1935 as 16mm motion picture film, and in 1936 as 35mm film for still cameras. Kodachrome films contain no color dye couplers; these are added during processing. The final development process published by Kodak as K-14 involves multiple re-exposure steps to sensitize the unsensitized grains.

In late 1936, Agfacolor Neu was launched, Agfa having overcome earlier difficulties with color sensitivity problems. This film had the dye couplers incorporated into the emulsion, making processing simpler than for Kodachrome.

Early color negative film had many shortcomings, including the high cost of the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlights of some types of print that became noticeable after several years. Amateurs who owned projection equipment used reversal films extensively because the cost of projection equipment and slide film was offset by not having to pay for prints. Eventually, print quality improved and prices decreased, and, by the 1970s, color negative film and color prints had largely displaced slides as the primary method of amateur photography.

Until about 1995, color transparency was preferred for publication because of the films&#x27; higher contrast and resolution, and was widely used in commercial and advertising photography, reportage, sports, stock and nature photography. Digital media gradually replaced transparency film.
==Film types==
All color reversal film sold today is developed with the E-6 process. The non-substantive Kodachrome films, the last of which was discontinued in 2009, were processed with the K-14 process.

Polaroid produced an instant slide film called Polachrome. It was packaged in cassettes like normal 35mm film. A separate processing unit was used to develop it after exposure.

===Black and white===
Black-and-white transparencies can be made directly with some modern black-and-white films, which normally yield negatives. The negative image is developed but not fixed. The negative image is removed by bleaching with a solution of potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate in dilute sulfuric acid, which is removed by washing and a clearing bath containing sodium metabisulfite or potassium metabisulfite. The remaining silver halide salts are re-exposed to light, developed and fixed, and the film is washed and dried.

Black-and-white transparencies were once popular for presentation of lecture materials using 3¼&quot;×4&quot; (3¼&quot; square in the UK) glass-mounted slides. Such positive black-and-white projection is now rarely done, except in motion pictures. Even where black-and-white positives are currently used, the process to create them typically uses an internegative with standard processing instead of a chemical reversal process.

Black-and-white reversal films are less common than color reversal films. 
*Agfa-Gevaert discontinued its Agfa Scala 200x Professional black-and-white reversal film. This could be developed with their proprietary Scala process. 
*The Adox company released Scala 160 in 2017, a black and white reversal film based on Agfa&#x27;s discontinued Scala. 
*The Foma company of the Czech Republic produces one of only remaining dedicated black-and-white reversal film for 35 mm stills, Fomapan R 100, which is also available in movie film formats.

*Kodak &amp; Foma currently produce kits for reversal processing.
*Kodak formerly offered a kit (&quot;Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit&quot;) for reversal processing of its now-discontinued Panatomic X film, which doubled the effective film speed from 32 to 64. The bleaching bath used potassium dichromate and sodium bisulfate; the redeveloper was a fogging developer, and so unstable that its shelf-life after mixing was only slightly longer than the amount of time needed to process a single roll. This was replaced with a &quot;T-Max Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit&quot;, which uses potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid in the bleach. In this kit, the fogging redeveloper is stable, but the bleach is not, with a shelf-life, once mixed, of no more than two weeks.
*dr5 Chrome process, which produces black-and-white transparencies from most traditional halide (i.e., non-chromogenic) black-and-white negative films.
* Kodak Tri-X Reversal Film 7266 and Kodak Plus-X Reversal Film 7265 are black-and-white reversal films used for movie-making.
*Ilford has published a reversal process applicable to all current B&amp;W emulsions, but recommended for Pan F+, FP4+, and Delta 100.

== Pros and cons ==
=== Pros ===
* Shows what exactly was captured on film without printing.
* More accurate color translation when digitizing. There is no need for color inversion processes.
* Much faster digitizing on professional scanner machines.
* In general, slide film produces much more vibrant colours than negative film.
* Finer grain, better resolution and sharpness compared to color negative films.

=== Cons ===
* Generally fewer stops of exposure latitude when compared to color negative film.
* Lower film speeds than color negative.
* Typically higher priced.

==Uses==
===Viewing===

Finished transparencies are most frequently displayed by projection. Some projectors use a sliding mechanism to manually pull the transparency out of the side of the machine, where it is replaced by the next image. Modern, advanced projectors typically use a &quot;carousel&quot; that holds a large number of slides; a mechanism automatically pulls a single slide from the carousel and places it in front of the lamp. Small externally lit or battery-powered magnifying viewers are available.

In traditional newsrooms and magazine offices slides were viewed using a lightbox and a loupe, which allowed rapid side by side comparison of similar images.

=== Slide copier ===
A slide copier is a simple optical device that can be fastened to the lens mount of a camera to enable slide duplicates to be made. Whilst these devices were formerly used to make duplicates on to slide film, they are often now used in conjunction with digital cameras to digitize images from film-based transparencies. This method usually gives better resolution than using attachments for digital A4 flat-bed scanners.

The devices are typically about 30 cm long, and screw into an intermediate &#x27;t-mount&#x27; attached to the camera. The lens in the copier does not need to be complex, because the systems are usually stopped down to small f numbers (e.g. for the Makinon Zoom Unit, at 1:1 magnification, falling to at 3:1 magnification), and the object and image distances are similar, so that many aberrations are minimized.

<text>Joseph Freinademetz (; April 15, 1852 – January 28, 1908), was a Ladin Catholic priest and missionary in China. He was a member of the Society of the Divine Word.

Freinademetz&#x27;s sainthood cause was opened after his death in 1908, and he was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2003.

==Early life==
Freinademetz was born the fourth among the 13 children of Giovanmattia and Anna Maria Freinademetz in Oies, a section of the town of Badia, which was then in the County of Tyrol, a part of the Austrian Empire, now a part of Italy. He studied theology in the diocesan seminary of Brixen and was ordained a priest on July 25, 1875. He was assigned to the community of San Martin de Tor, not far from his own home.

During his studies and the three years in San Martino, Freinademetz always felt a calling to be a missionary. He contacted Arnold Janssen, founder of the Society of the Divine Word, a missionary congregation based in Steyl, Netherlands. With the permission of his parents and his bishop, he moved to Steyl in August 1878, where he received training as a missionary.

==Missionary work==
In March 1879, he and his confrere Johann Baptist von Anzer boarded a ship to Hong Kong, where they arrived five weeks later. They stayed there for two years. Freinademetz was based in Sai Kung Peninsula until 1880 and set up a chapel on the island of Yim Tin Tsai in 1879. In 1881 they moved to the southern region of the Province of Shandong, to which they had been assigned. At the time of their arrival, there were 12 million people living in that province, of which 158 had been baptized.

Freinademetz was very active in the education of Chinese laymen and priests. He wrote a catechism in Chinese, which he considered a crucial part of their missionary effort. In 1898, he was sick with laryngitis and tuberculosis, so Anzer, who had become the bishop of the region, and other priests convinced him to go to Japan to recuperate. He returned, but was still not fully cured. When Anzer had to leave China for a journey to Europe in 1907, the administration of the diocese was assigned to Freinademetz.

==Death==
There was an outbreak of typhus in this time, and he helped wherever he could, until he himself became infected. He returned to Daijiazhuang (, historically spelled &quot;Taikia&quot; or &quot;Taichia&quot;), Rencheng District, Jining, South Shandong, where he died from typhus. He was buried in Daijiazhuang, at the twelfth station on the Way of the Cross.

==Legacy==
Freinademetz&#x27;s spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 20 November 1940, and his cause was formally opened on 22 June 1951, granting him the title of Servant of God. Freinademetz, together with Arnold Janssen, the founder of his Society, was canonized on October 5, 2003, by Pope John Paul II, as was Daniel Comboni, the founder of the Comboni Missionaries, which works in Africa.

Under his patronage is the St. Joseph Freinademetz German National Parish in Beijing, a parish for German-speaking residents and visitors.

<text>The Archdiocese of San Francisco (Latin: &quot;Archdiœcesis Sancti Francisci&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Arquidiócesis de San Francisco&quot;) is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption.

== Territory ==
The Archdiocese of San Francisco covers San Francisco, Marin County, and San Mateo County. It is the metropolitan see of a province that includes the following suffragan dioceses:
* Diocese of Honolulu
* Diocese of Oakland
* Diocese of San Jose
* Diocese of Santa Rosa
* Diocese of Sacramento
* Diocese of Stockton

==History==
=== 1776 to 1853 ===
The first church in the Archdiocese of San Francisco is older than the archdiocese itself; Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores) was founded in 1776, by Franciscan Friars. The friars built the current mission building in 1791.

After the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, California and the Intermountain West became part of the United States. The Vatican erected the new Diocese of Monterey in 1849 to remove these areas from the jurisdiction of the Mexican Catholic hierarchy. The new diocese covered the California Territory east to the Colorado River. St. Francis of Assisi Parish was founded in San Francisco in 1849 and St. Patrick in the same city in 1851. In 1850, the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, the western province for the Dominican Order in the United States, was established in San Francisco.

=== 1853 to 1884 ===
In 1853, the Vatican erected the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Its jurisdiction extended to northern and central California, along with present-day Nevada and Utah. Pope Pius IX named Bishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany of Monterey as the first archbishop of San Francisco. Old St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral on California Street was dedicated in 1854. In 1855, the Society of Jesus founded St. Ignatius Academy in San Francisco, the forerunner of the University of San Francisco. Alemany founded Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Moraga in 1863, then turned its operation over to the De La Salle Christian Brothers in 1868.

As archbishop of San Francisco, Alemany presided over a multinational archdiocese, owing to the influx of people to California during the California Gold Rush. He established parishes for the city&#x27;s Italian, Irish, French, German and Mexican communities. In 1883, Bishop Patrick Riordan from the Diocese of Chicago was appointed as coadjutor archbishop by Pope Leo XIII to assist Alemany. In May 1883 Alemany purchased land in San Francisco for a larger cathedral to serve the growing Catholic population.

When Alemany retired in 1884, Riordan automatically succeeded him as archbishop. In 1884, Riordan&#x27;s first full year in San Francisco, the archdiocese contained 175 priests, 128 churches, and 25 chapels and stations to serve a Catholic population of 200,000. Riordan laid the cornerstone in 1887 and dedicated the new Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in 1891.

=== 1884 to 1914 ===
In early 1894, Riordan protested against the use of &quot;Outlines of Mediæval and Modern History&quot; by Philip van Ness Myers in San Francisco&#x27;s public schools. He denounced the book as anti-Catholic and declared that it was &quot;utterly unfit for use in a school patronized by children of various creeds.&quot; In April 1894, the San Francisco Board of Education ruled that the book would still be used but allowed teachers to omit any passages that might &quot;appear in any way to favor or to reflect on the particular doctrines or tenets of any religious sect.&quot;

In 1906, the San Francisco earthquake caused $2 to $6 million in damages to over 12 churches and other institutions in the archdiocese. Riordan celebrated open-air Masses for his displaced parishioners, who were living amidst the ruins in temporary shelters, and assured them, &quot;We shall rebuild.&quot; Riordan temporarily moved in San Mateo, allowing the Presentation Sisters, who had lost their convent, to use the archbishop&#x27;s residence. Every church that had been destroyed had a temporary structure within two years and was rebuilt within another eight years. By the time of Riordan&#x27;s death in 1914, the archdiocese had 367 priests, 182 churches, 94 chapels and stations, and 94 parochial schools for 280,000 Catholics. Many of the new parishes under his administration were established for immigrant communities.

=== 1914 to 1962 ===
Riordan was succeeded as archbishop of San Francisco by Auxiliary Bishop Edward Hanna of San Francisco, appointed by Pope Gregory XV in 1915. The rebuilding of the Mission Dolores Church after its destruction in the 1906 earthquake was completed in 1918. In 1921, Hanna was named chairman of San Francisco&#x27;s wage arbitration boards; Hanna served on the boards through 1924. Hanna was key to the 1924 opening of St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Mountain View. In 1932, Pope Pius XI appointed Bishop John Mitty of the Diocese of Salt Lake as coadjutor archbishop to assist Hanna.

Hanna was appointed in 1933 as the chairman of a state mediation board to resolve the cotton strike in Corcoran. During the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, President Franklin Roosevelt named Hanna the chairman of the National Longshoremen&#x27;s Board. The board was tasked with resolving the strike by mediating between the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association, the International Seamen&#x27;s Union, and their employers.

When Hanna retired in 1935, Mitty automatically succeeded him as archbishop of San Francisco. Mitty&#x27;s first act as archbishop was to direct his installation gift from the clergy to restoring Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park. He purchased St. Mary&#x27;s College of California from the De La Salle Christian Brothers in 1937, and reopened it in 1938. In the twenty six years of his episcopate, 84 parishes and missions were founded in the archdiocese, and over 500 building projects were completed. Mitty caused controversy in 1944 when he called for a boycott of the &quot;San Francisco News&quot;. The newspaper had reported on the DWI arrest of one of his priests; Mitty called the coverage anti-Catholic. In 1952, the Vatican elected the Mission Dolores Church to a basilica. Mitty died in 1961.

=== 1962 to 1983 ===

Pope John XXIII named Bishop Joseph McGucken from the Diocese of Sacramento as the next archbishop of San Francisco in 1962. That same year, an arson fire destroyed the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption. The cornerstone for the new cathedral was laid in 1967 and the building was completed in 1970.

In 1968, McGucken became embroiled in a controversy with Reverend Eugene Boyle, a progressive diocesan priest with ties to the Black Panther Party. The group had set up, with Boyle&#x27;s permission, their Free Breakfast program at Sacred Heart School for primary school children in the archdiocese. Word soon came out that the Black Panthers were distributing a coloring book at the school that advocated violence against police officers. Boyle said that when he learned about the book, he blocked its distribution. To appease public outrage over Boyle&#x27;s defense of the Black Panthers, McGucken cancelled a yearly seminar that Boyle would deliver. Facing intense accusations of racial bias from parts of the public, McGucken asked the San Francisco priest&#x27;s senate to review his decision. In December 1968, the senate ruled that McGucken should reinstate Boyle&#x27;s seminar, but also denied that McGucken had made his decision on racial grounds.

After McGucken retired in 1977, Pope Paul VI named Archbishop John R. Quinn of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City as the next archbishop of San Francisco. In 1981, at Quinn&#x27;s request, the Vatican erected the Diocese of San Jose, taking its territory from the archdiocese.

=== 1983 to 2012 ===

Quinn reached out to gay Catholics in the archdiocese as early as 1983. He issued a document that asked priests to take concerns of gay people seriously. In it, he said he wanted gay Catholics to find &quot;a church where he or she will find acceptance, understanding, and love.&quot; Priests were reminded in the letter that many gay Catholics saw their orientation as a positive. He supported the efforts of Most Holy Redeemer Church in the Castro district in their efforts to reach out to the LGBTQ+ population of the neighborhood.

Quinn regularly visited this parish, especially during the annual 40 Hours Vigil held throughout the 1980s in support of those who were HIV-positive and their caregivers. In 1985, Quinn initiated the Catholic Church&#x27;s first institutional response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. When Pope John Paul II visited San Francisco in 1987, Quinn arranged for him to meet with several HIV/AIDS patients, including a young boy.

The damage caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake prompted the archdiocese to close a dozen parishes with severely damaged buildings. This plan drew the wrath of many priests, 41 of whom signed a dissenting petition. Quinn sold the former archiepiscopal residence and in 1992 moved into the cathedral rectory, where he lived with fellow clergy until his retirement. In August 1995, Archbishop William Levada from the Archdiocese of Portland was appointed coadjutor archbishop of San Francisco by John Paul II to assist Quinn.

When Quinn retired in December 1995, Levada automatically succeeded him as archbishop of San Francisco. In 1996, Patrick O&#x27;Shea, a former advisor to Quinn, was charged with embezzling over $260,000 in donations from the archdiocese. In 2004, O&#x27;Shea pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served in prison for molestation charges and ordered to pay $187,000 back to the archdiocese. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI named Levada as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome. To replace Levada in San Francisco, the pope named Bishop George Niederauer of Salt Lake City.

=== 2012 to present ===

In 2012, Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Salvatore J. Cordileone from the Diocese of Oakland as the next archbishop of San Francisco, replacing the retired Niederauer. In February 2015, Cordileone told teachers in the archdiocesan school system that they were expected to conduct their public lives in a way that does not undermine or deny the church&#x27;s doctrine. Democratic California State Assemblymen Phil Ting of San Francisco and Kevin Mullin of San Mateo sent a letter to Cordileone urging him to withdraw what they called &quot;discriminatory morality clauses&quot;. The letter was signed by lawmakers from each community in the archdiocese with a Catholic high school. Cordileone responded, saying he &quot;respects the lawmakers&#x27; right to hire whoever [sic] may advance their mission and that he is asking for the same respect&quot;. Ting and Mulin called for an investigation of working conditions at archdiocesan high schools over the archbishop&#x27;s proposed morality clauses for teachers.

In April 2015, more than 100 Catholic donors and church members from the Bay Area signed a full-page advertisement in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; appealing to Pope Francis to replace Cordileone. The signers objected to Cordileone&#x27;s characterization of extramarital sex and LBGTQ+ relationships as &quot;gravely evil&quot;, saying that Cordileone fostered &quot;an atmosphere of division and intolerance&quot;. The archdiocese responded that the advertisement was a &quot;misrepresentation of the spirit of the archbishop&quot; and that it was also a misrepresentation to suggest that the signers spoke for the entire Catholic community in the Bay Area. The archdiocese claimed to have received over 7,500 letters of support. A subsequent picnic set up to show support for Cordileone was held in May 2015 in San Francisco.

In April 2022, Cordileone warned Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a San Francisco resident, that he would prohibit her from receiving Holy Communion unless she repudiated her promotion of abortion rights. In May 2022, Cordileone notified her and publicly announced that he took that action.

Pope Francis erected the Archdiocese of Las Vegas in May 2023, suppressing the Diocese of Las Vegas that had been a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. The dioceses of Reno and Salt Lake City then became suffragan dioceses of the new archdiocese.

As of 2025, Cordileone is the archbishop of San Francisco.

=== Sex abuse ===
Reverend Patrick O&#x27;Shea was defrocked in 1994 after numerous men accused him of sexually abusing them as boys. O&#x27;Shea had operated the altar server program at Mission Dolores in the 1960s. He was convicted in 1995 of sexually molesting 13 boys. After serving two years in prison, O&#x27;Shea was released in 2002 after all the molestation charges were overturned in an appeals court. The archdiocese in 2005 agreed to a $4 million legal settlement for O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s victims.

In a 2006 court deposition, it was revealed that in 1992 Bishop Levada had removed Reverend Joseph Baccellieri from ministry after hearing allegations that he had sexually molested three boys during the 1970s. Levada sent Baccellieri away for treatment and in 1995 assigned him to a new parish, with monitoring and numerous restrictions. At no point did Levada notify Baccellieri&#x27;s former parish or report him to law enforcement. Levada defended his actions in the deposition, saying he had made the right decision. In 2018, the archdiocese reported that had spent $87 million in settling sexual abuse lawsuits since 2005. Archbishop Cordileone said that there were no new allegations dating after 2000.

In 2019, the archdiocese provided documents to California State Attorney Xavier Becerra in preparation for lawsuits after the statute of limitations was temporarily removed in 2020.

Due to these claims, the archdiocese announced that bankruptcy was highly likely in August 2022.

In 2022, Cordileone released a list of 312 clergy with credible accusations of sexual abuse of minors, going back 100 years. In August 2023, the archdiocese filed a petition under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code in the San Francisco County Superior Court after it officially confirmed it was declared broke, and could no longer afford any cash to pay off the estimated 500 sex abuse lawsuits.

<text>The M3 Stuart/light tank M3, was a US light tank of World War II, first entered service in the British Army in early 1941 and saw action in the North African campaign in July 1941. Later an improved version of the tank entered service as the M5 in 1942 to be supplied to British and other allied Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the United States into the war.

The British service name &quot;Stuart&quot; came from the U.S. Civil War Confederate general J. E. B. Stuart and was used for both the M3 and the derivative M5 light tank. Unofficially, they were also often called &quot;Honeys&quot; by the British, because of their smooth ride. In U.S. use, the tanks were officially known as &quot;light tank M3&quot; and &quot;light tank M5&quot;.

Stuarts were first used in combat in the North African campaign; about 170 were used by the British forces in Operation Crusader (18 November – 30 December 1941). Stuarts were the first American-crewed tanks in World War II to engage the enemy in tank versus tank combat when used in the Philippines in December 1941 against the Japanese. Outside of the Pacific War, in later years of WWII the M3 was used for reconnaissance and screening.

==Development==

Observing events in Europe and Asia during World War II, American tank designers realized that the light tank M2 was becoming obsolete and set about improving it. The upgraded design, with thicker armor, modified suspension and new gun recoil system was called &quot;light tank M3&quot;. Production of the vehicle started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943.

By the standards of the era for light tanks, the Stuart was fairly heavily armored. It had 38 mm of armor on the upper front hull, 44 mm on the lower front hull, 51 mm on the gun mantlet, 38 mm on the turret sides, 25 mm on the hull sides, and 25 mm on the hull rear. Like its direct predecessor, the M2A4, the M3 was initially armed with a 37 mm M5 gun and five .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine guns: one coaxial with the main gun, one on top of the turret in an M20 anti-aircraft mount, another in a ball mount in right bow, and two more in the right and left hull sponsons. Later, the main gun was replaced with the slightly longer M6, and the sponson machine guns were removed.

The M3 and M3A1 variants were powered by an air-cooled radial engine, either a gasoline-fueled 7-cylinder Continental W-670 (8,936 built) or a 9-cylinder Guiberson T-1020 diesel (1,496 built). Both of these powerplants were originally developed as aircraft engines. Internally, the radial engine was at the rear and the transmission at the front of the tank&#x27;s hull. The driveshaft connecting the engine and transmission ran through the middle of the fighting compartment. The radial engine&#x27;s crankshaft was positioned high off the hull bottom and contributed to the tank&#x27;s relatively tall profile. When a revolving turret floor was introduced in the M3 hybrid and M3A1, the crew had less room. A further 3,427 M3A3 variants were built with modified hull (similar to the M5), new turret and the Continental W-670 gasoline engine. In contrast to the M2A4, all M3/M5 series tanks had a trailing rear idler wheel for increased ground contact, whereas on the M2 the idler wheel was off the ground and did not aid in suspension.

===M5 Stuart===

To relieve wartime demand for the radial aero-engines used in the M3, a new version was developed using twin Cadillac V8 automobile engines and twin Hydra-Matic transmissions operating through a transfer case. This version of the tank was quieter, cooler and roomier; the automatic transmission also simplified crew training. The new model (initially called M4 but redesignated M5 to avoid confusion with the M4 Sherman) featured a redesigned hull with a raised rear deck over the engine compartment, sloped glacis plate and driver&#x27;s hatches moved to the top. Although the main criticism from units using the Stuarts was that it lacked firepower, the improved M5 series kept the same 37 mm gun. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and, after the M7 project proved unsatisfactory, was succeeded by the light tank M24 in 1944. Total M5 and M5A1 tank production was 8,884; an additional 1,778 M8 75 mm howitzer motor carriages based on the M5 chassis with an open-top turret were produced.

==Light-tank doctrine==

Light tanks were issued to tank battalions (one of the four companies was a light tank company), light tank battalions and cavalry reconnaissance squadrons. The original role of the light tank in these formations was similar to medium tanks and they were expected to engage enemy armor with AP rounds and enemy positions with HE rounds. As a result, tank gunnery training for light and medium tankers was common.

US Army Field Manuals written before 1944 clearly show that light tanks were to be part of an armored assault on enemy positions, and examples of fire on enemy armor were in these manuals. When pursuing an enemy, light tank battalions were expected to move parallel with enemy columns and, together with accompanying infantry and engineer units, seize &quot;critical terrain that will block hostile retreat&quot;. Despite the fact that light tank platoons were not expected to function as a reconnaissance unit, they could be used for reconnaissance purposes. In this role, they were expected to remain behind the main reconnaissance force as the support element and augment the firepower whenever enemy contact was made.

==Combat history==

===War in North Africa and Europe===
British and other Commonwealth armies were the first to use the light tank M3, as the &quot;Stuart&quot;, in combat. From mid-November 1941 to the end of the year, about 170 Stuarts (in a total force of over 700 tanks) took part in Operation Crusader during the North Africa Campaign, with poor results. This is despite the fact that the M3 was superior or comparable in most regards to most of the tanks used by the Axis forces. The most numerous German tank, the Panzer III Ausf G, had nearly identical armor and speed to the M3, and both tanks&#x27; guns could penetrate the other tank&#x27;s front armor from beyond . The most numerous Italian tank (and second most numerous Axis tank overall), the Fiat M13/40, was much slower than the Stuart, had slightly weaker armor all around, and could not penetrate the Stuart&#x27;s front hull or turret armor at 1,000 meters, whereas the Stuart&#x27;s gun could penetrate any spot on the M13/40. Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with the better tactics and training of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; than the apparent superiority of German armored fighting vehicles used in the North African campaign, the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37 mm M5 gun and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. The Stuart also had a limited range, which was a severe problem in the highly mobile desert warfare as units often outpaced their supplies and were stranded when they ran out of fuel.
On the positive side, crews liked its relatively high speed and mechanical reliability, especially compared to the Crusader tank, which comprised a large portion of the British tank force in Africa up until 1942. The Crusader had similar armament and armor to the Stuart while being slower, less reliable, and several tons heavier. The Stuart also had the advantage of a gun that could deliver high-explosive shells; HE shells were not available for the 40 mm QF 2-pdr gun mounted by most Crusaders, severely limiting their use against emplaced anti-tank guns or infantry. The main drawback of the Stuart was its low fuel capacity and range; its operational range was only cross country, roughly half that of the Crusader.

In the summer of 1942, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat, using them primarily for reconnaissance. The turret was removed from some examples to save weight and improve speed and range. These became known as &quot;Stuart Recce&quot;. Some others were converted to armored personnel carriers known as the &quot;Stuart Kangaroo&quot;, and some were converted into command vehicles and known as &quot;Stuart Command&quot;. M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than U.S. units.

====Eastern Front====
The other major Lend-Lease recipient of the M3, the Soviet Union, was less happy with the tank, considering it under-gunned, under-armored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The M3&#x27;s radial aircraft engine required high-octane fuel, which complicated Soviet logistics as most of their tanks used diesel or low-octane fuel. High fuel consumption led to a poor range characteristic, especially sensitive for use as a reconnaissance vehicle. In the letter sent to Franklin Roosevelt (18 July 1942), Stalin wrote: &quot;I consider it my duty to warn you that, according to our experts at the front, U.S. tanks catch fire very easily when hit from behind or from the side by anti-tank rifle bullets. The reason is that the high-grade gasoline used forms inside the tank a thick layer of highly inflammable fumes.&quot;

Also, compared to Soviet tanks, the M3&#x27;s narrower tracks resulted in a higher ground pressure, getting them more easily stuck in the &quot;Rasputitsa&quot; muddy conditions of spring and autumn and winter snow conditions on the Eastern Front. In 1943, the Red Army tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design was not much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.

====Italy====
One of the more successful uses of the M5 in combat came during the Battle of Anzio when breaking through German forces surrounding the beachhead. The tactics called for an initial breakthrough by a medium tank company to destroy the heavier defenses, followed by an infantry battalion who would attack the German troops who were being left behind the medium tanks. Since many hidden fortifications and positions would have survived the initial medium tank assault, the infantry would then be confronted by any remaining fortified German troops. Behind the infantry came the M5s of a light tank company, who would attack these positions when directed to by the Infantry, usually by the use of green smoke grenades.

In the 1944 Liri Valley campaign, the official history of the 18th Battalion (New Zealand) notes that in the campaign (a war of movement) the regiment discovered that the Stuart recce tanks were an enormous advance on scout cars, and could go where not even jeeps could go. They carried commanders and engineers, and medical orderlies, and they could explore flanks while the Shermans forged ahead. They carried mobile wireless links and transported supplies up hilltops; they had a dozen different uses.

===Pacific and Asia===
The U.S. Army initially deployed 108 Stuart light tanks to the Philippines in September 1941, equipping the U.S. Army&#x27;s 194th and 192nd Tank Battalions. The first U.S. tank versus tank combat to occur in World War II happened on 22 December 1941 during the Philippines campaign (1941–1942) when a platoon of five M3s led by Lieutenant Ben R. Morin engaged the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) 4th Tank Regiment&#x27;s Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks north of Damortis. Lt. Morin, with his 37mm cannon locked in recoil maneuvered his M3 off the road, but took a direct hit while doing so, and his tank began to burn. The other four M3s were also hit, but managed to leave the field under their own power. Lt. Morin was wounded, and he and his crew were captured by the enemy. M3s of the 194th and 192nd Tank Battalions continued to skirmish with the 4th Tank Regiment&#x27;s tanks as they continued their retreat down the Bataan Peninsula, with the last tank versus tank combat occurring on 7 April 1942.

As the Japanese 15th Army was threatening southern Burma toward the end of February 1942, 7th Armoured Brigade of the British Army landed at Rangoon with 114 M-3 Stuarts bearing the green rodent of the &quot;Desert Rats&quot;. They supported 17th Indian Division and 1st Burma Division on the retreat until they managed to escape to India in April.
Due to the naval nature of the Pacific campaign, steel for warship production took precedence over tanks for the IJA, creating by default an IJA light tank that performed admirably in the jungle terrain of the South Pacific. By the same measure, although the US was not hampered by industrial restrictions, the U.S. M3 light tank proved to be an effective armored vehicle for fighting in jungle environments. At least one was captured in the Philippines.

With the IJA&#x27;s drive toward India within the South-East Asian theatre of World War II, the United Kingdom hastily withdrew their 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and 7th Hussars Stuart tank units (which also contained some M2A4 light tanks) from North Africa, and deployed them against the Japanese 14th Tank Regiment. By the time the Japanese had been stopped at Imphal, only one British Stuart remained operational. When the U.S. entered the war in 1941, it began to supply China with AFVs, including M3 Stuarts, and later M4 Sherman medium tanks and M18 Hellcat tank destroyers, which trickled in through Burma.

Although the U.S. light tanks had proven effective in jungle warfare, by late 1943, U.S. Marine Corps tank battalions were transitioning from their M3/M5 light tanks to M4 medium tanks, mostly for the much greater high-explosive blast effect of the M4&#x27;s 75mm gun, which fired a much larger shell with a heavier explosive payload.

===Obsolescence and replacement===
When the U.S. Army joined the North African Campaign in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength. After the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass, the U.S. quickly followed the British in disbanding most of their light tank battalions and reorganizing medium tank battalions to include one company of light tanks, where the Stuarts mostly performed the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening; for the rest of the war, most U.S. tank battalions had three companies of M4 Shermans and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s.
In Europe, Allied light tanks were given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their light main armament was not competitive against heavier enemy armored fighting vehicles. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the Pacific Theater, as Japanese tanks were both relatively rare and were lighter in armor than even Allied light tanks. Japanese infantrymen were not well equipped with anti-tank weapons, and as such had to use close assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks.

Though the Stuart was to be completely replaced by the newer M24 Chaffee, the number of M3s/M5s produced was so great (over 25,000 including the 75mm HMC M8) that the tank remained in service until the end of the war, and well after. In addition to the U.S, UK and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by France (M3A3 and M5A1), China (M3A3s and, immediately post-war, M5A1s) and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans in Yugoslavia (M3A3s and few M3A1).

With the limitations of both the main gun (see below) and armor, the Stuart&#x27;s intended combat role in Western Europe was changed significantly. Light tank companies were often paired with cavalry reconnaissance units, or else used for guarding or screening, and even used in supply or messenger roles for medium tank units.

==== Limitations of the 37mm gun ====
On 9 December 1944, the 759th Tank Battalion advanced on a hill near Bogheim but was subjected to a counter-attack by German forces, including a heavy self-propelled assault gun, which took &quot;over 100 direct hits&quot; at ranges as low as with &quot;no appreciable damage&quot;.

In January 1945, a report to General Eisenhower concluded that the Stuart was &quot;obsolete in every respect as a fighting tank&quot; and that it would not &quot;turn the German fire [n]or [would] the 37mm gun damage the German tanks or SP guns&quot;.

===Post World War II use===

After the war, some countries chose to equip their armies with cheap and reliable war surplus Stuarts. The Chinese Nationalist Army having suffered great attrition as a result of the ensuing civil war, rebuilt their armored forces by acquiring surplus vehicles left behind in the Philippines by the U.S. forces, including 21 M5A1s to equip two tank companies.

The M5 played a significant role in the First Kashmir War (1947) between India and Pakistan, including the battle of Zoji-la pass fought at an elevation of nearly .

M3A1 and M3A3s were used by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution, where they suffered heavy losses due to the Stuart&#x27;s thin armor plating. They were used until 1946, when the British left. The M3A1 and M3A3s were then passed on to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, which used them until the end of the fighting before passing on the tanks to the Indonesian Army. The tank saw action during the Darul Islam rebellions in Aceh and Java, Republic of South Maluku rebellions in South Maluku, PRRI rebellions in Sumatra, Permesta rebellions in Northern Sulawesi and the fighting against the 30 September Movement.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Portuguese Army also used a small number of M5A1 light tanks, out of a total of 90 received as military aid from Canada in 1956, in the war in Angola, where its all-terrain capability (compared to wheeled vehicles) was greatly appreciated. In 1967, the Portuguese Army deployed three M5A1 light tanks – nicknamed &quot;Milocas&quot;, &quot;Licas&quot;, and &quot;Gina&quot; by their crews – to northern Angola, which served with the 1927th Cavalry Battalion commanded by Cavalry Major João Mendes Paulo, stationed at Nambuangongo. The vehicles were mostly employed for convoy escort and recovery duties and limited counterinsurgency operations against National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) guerrillas, who dubbed them &quot;Elefante Dundum&quot;. &quot;Milocas&quot; was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1969, while &quot;Gina&quot; and &quot;Licas&quot; were withdrawn from active service in 1972, the former being sent to Luanda and the latter ended up in 1973 as an airfield security pillbox in the Portuguese Air Force&#x27;s Zala airfield. Period photographs show some modifications to the basic design, namely the omission of the bow machine gun, re-installed on a pintle mount in the roof of the turret, and a small searchlight fitted in front of the commander&#x27;s cupola.

During the four-day long Football War of 1969, El Salvador invaded Honduras in an all-out-war strike using the M3 Stuart as the main battle tank. El Salvador captured eight major cities before the Organization of American States arranged a ceasefire.

The South African Armoured Corps continued to use M3A1s in a reserve role until 1955. Some were refurbished locally in 1962 and remained in service as late as 1964. The fleet was withdrawn in 1968, owing to parts shortage.

The M3 Stuart is still on the active list in the Armed Forces of Paraguay, with ten of the tanks being overhauled in 2014 to provide a training capability. Ecuador also still has a number in service.

<text>The M22 Locust, officially Light Tank (Airborne), M22, was an American-designed airborne light tank which was produced during World War II. The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office requested that the American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank for use by the airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Army Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft; its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.

After a series of modifications were made to the initial prototype, production of the T9 began in April 1943. It was significantly delayed, however, when several faults were found with the tank&#x27;s design. Marmon-Herrington only began to produce significant numbers of the T9 in late 1943 and early 1944, and by then the design was considered to be obsolete; only 830 were built by the time production ended in February 1945. As a result, the Ordnance Department gave the tank the specification number M22 but no combat units were equipped with it. However, the War Office believed that the tank would perform adequately despite its faults, so the tank was given the title of &quot;Locust&quot; and 260 were shipped to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. Seventeen Locusts were received by the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in late 1943, but mechanical problems led to the tanks being withdrawn in favor of the Tetrarchs previously used by the regiment.

In October 1944 however, the remaining Tetrarchs of the regiment were replaced by Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945. The tanks did not perform well in action; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German self-propelled gun. Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action, occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company. The tanks were forced to withdraw from the position after several hours however, because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties. The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946. A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post-war period; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments, and the Egyptian Army used several company-sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Development history==
===Background===
The Light Tank (Airborne) M22, also known as the Locust, began development in late 1941 in response to a request by the British military earlier in the year for an airmobile light tank which could be transported onto a battlefield by glider. At the time the request was made, the War Office considered using the equipment in Britain&#x27;s fledgling airborne forces, which had been formed in June 1940 by order of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. When officials at the War Office examined the equipment that would be required for a British airborne division, they decided that gliders would be an integral component of such a force. These gliders would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment, which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank. Plans to transport an airborne tank went through a number of revisions, but by May 1941 it was considered feasible for a tank weighing to be carried for in a glider, although the latter would have to be specifically designed for the task. In a conference held on 16 January 1941, it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar, under development at the time, would be used to transport a single tank or two Universal Carriers.

A decision had recently been made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.

A purpose-built airborne light tank was therefore required to replace the Tetrarch, but the decision was taken by the War Office not to produce the tank in Britain due to a lack of production capacity. Instead the American government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for the Tetrarch. This request was made by the British Air Commission in Washington, D.C., with a proposal calling for a tank of between and to be developed, this being the maximum weight the War Office had decided could be carried by current glider technology. The proposed tank was to have a primary armament of a main gun and secondary armament of a .30-06 Browning M1919A4, and a crew of three. The specification also called for a maximum speed of and an operational radius of . The turret and front of the hull were to have an armor thickness of between and , and the sides of the tank a thickness of . The United States Ordnance Department was given the task of developing the proposed tank, and in turn requested designs from three American companies: General Motors, J. Walter Christie and Marmon-Herrington. The design offered by Christie in mid-1941 was rejected as it failed to meet the specified size requirements, as was a modified design the company produced in November. At a conference in May 1941, the Ordnance Department chose the Marmon-Herrington design and requested that the company produce a prototype tank, which was completed in late 1941; it was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne) by the company and the Ordnance Department.

===Development===

The T9 had a crew of three and weighed . It was armed with a main gun and a coaxial .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine-gun, as well as two further machine-guns on the right-hand side of the bow. The main gun and coaxial machine-gun were mounted in a powered turret, which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow the gun to be fired when the tank was moving. The T9 was powered by a 162 horse-power six-cylinder, air-cooled Lycoming engine, and the thickness of the armor varied; the front, rear and sides of the hull had a thickness of while the sloped portions of the hull had a thickness of . The tank&#x27;s engine was able to give it a maximum speed of . The T9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider, a significant change from the original request, but instead was to be carried under the belly of a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, using four lifting brackets welded onto each side of the hull of the tank. The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C-54 and reattached once on the battlefield. The loading took six men about twenty-five minutes, the unloading ten minutes. On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land. However, the T9 was of the correct shape, weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider, suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required.

A number of changes were made to the prototype during testing. The main change was the addition of supporting steel beams to improve and strengthen the suspension of the tank, which increased the weight to , the maximum weight that could be carried by a Hamilcar glider. Two new prototypes were ordered by the Ordnance Department in January 1942 and were delivered by Marmon-Herrington in November 1942. They were both designated T9E1. The new tanks incorporated a number of requested changes. The turret was altered in shape; it was lightened by the removal of the power traverse mechanism and the gyro stabilizer for the main armament. The front of the hull was altered from a stepped appearance to a more sloped profile, which would provide for a better ballistic shape; the two .30-06 machine-guns were removed from the bow of the tank and the suspension was altered to try and reduce the weight of the design. However, contrary to normal practice, the Ordnance Department had placed an order for the original T9 design in April 1942, before the T9E1 models were delivered in November 1942; 500 were ordered in April and this order rapidly increased to a total of 1900, with deliveries to begin in November. However, production difficulties and design changes caused this date to be delayed several times, and it was not until April 1943 that production of the T9 actually began.

Production of the T9 peaked at 100 tanks produced per month between August 1943 and January 1944; however, this number rapidly declined when the results of the British and American testing programs were reported to the Ordnance Department, and only 830 T9s were ever produced. The faults discovered with the design led to the Ordnance Department giving it the specification number M22, but classing it as &#x27;limited standard&#x27;. No American combat units were equipped with the tank, although some of those produced were used for training purposes and two experimental units were formed and equipped with Locusts. The 151st Airborne Tank Company was formed on 15 August 1943, despite concerns that there would be insufficient transport aircraft to deliver the unit into battle, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was also formed in December of the same year. However, neither unit saw combat, due to the US Army&#x27;s lack of interest in using them in an airborne capacity. The 151st Airborne Tank Company remained in the United States, shuttling from base to base throughout the war, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was refitted with conventional tanks in October 1944. Some 25 Locusts were ordered in April 1944 for use in the European Theater of Operations, and delivered by September; although a small number were sent to the United States Sixth Army Group in Alsace, France, for testing, they were never used in combat. However, the British still required the M22 as a replacement for the Tetrarch and the first prototype Locust was shipped to Britain in May 1942 for testing, followed by the second prototype T9E1 in July 1943. Although they were of the opinion that the M22 possessed a number of faults, the War Office believed it would perform adequately as an airborne tank. Thus the tank received the official title of &quot;Locust&quot; and 260 were shipped to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. The majority of the Locusts ended up placed in tank parks until they were scrapped at the end of the conflict, and only eight ever saw action with British airborne forces.

===Faults===

Extensive testing of the M22 occurred in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted that the process of loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a .50 caliber machine-gun. Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on 13 March 1944, by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
====Initial service====
By late 1941, several new British units had been raised specifically trained to conduct airborne operations. The largest such unit was the newly formed 1st Airborne Division, and on 19 January 1942 the War Office took the decision that a light tank detachment would be amongst the support units attached to the division. Designated the Light Tank Squadron, this unit was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division, using their speed to capture objectives and hold them until relieved by other units. The unit chosen for conversion into the Light Tank Squadron was &#x27;C&#x27; Special Services Squadron, which had seen service as an independent tank unit during Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Madagascar in mid-1942. The squadron was also equipped with Tetrarchs, which had recently been re-designated as an airborne tank by the War Office. &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942, bringing with it seven Tetrarchs amongst the other vehicles it was equipped with. The unit immediately began training, but did not stay attached to the 1st Airborne Division for very long; during mid-1943, the division was transported to the Middle East, where it would eventually participate in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of the island of Sicily. &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron remained in Britain however, as not enough Hamilcar gliders had yet been built to transport and deploy all of their Tetrarchs.

The squadron was transferred to the division with which it would spend the rest of the war; the 6th Airborne Division, raised in April 1943. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with the duties it would perform, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter-attacks against enemy infantry and armor. In mid-July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed, and then on 25 October the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts. During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron, replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) infantry support howitzer, which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support), were retained. Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn adaptors to increase the range and penetration power of their main armament, although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron. The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943, and as late as March 1944, plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. However, records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs, and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced. This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts, as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust&#x27;s gearbox.

The regiment took part in Operation Tonga as part of 6th Airlanding Brigade in June 1944, equipped with twenty Tetrarchs. However, due to their thin armor and underpowered armament they proved to be completely outclassed by the tanks and self-propelled guns deployed by German forces, such as the Panzer IV and the Sturmgeschütz III. By August, in preparation for the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s participation in the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, the majority of Tetrarchs in &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks; only three Tetrarchs were retained, remaining with the Headquarters troop of &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron. In September the division returned to Britain and in the first week of October 1944, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization. The regiment was completely restructured and retired all the remaining Tetrarch tanks it was equipped with, replacing them with Locusts.

==== Operation Varsity ====
In March 1945, the 6th Airborne Division was informed that it would be participating in Operation Varsity, an airborne operation in support of 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine during Operation Plunder. On 24 March the division, in conjunction with the American United States 17th Airborne Division, would be dropped by parachute and glider near the city of Wesel, where it would capture the strategically important village of Hamminkeln, several important bridges over the River IJssel and the southern portion of a major forest, the Diersfordter Wald. Eight Locusts from the regiment, divided into two troops of four, would land with the 6th Airlanding Brigade in landing-zone &#x27;P&#x27; east of the Diersfordter Wald and west of Hamminkeln, acting as a divisional reserve; the rest of the regiment would arrive by road after crossing the Rhine with 21st Army Group.

The eight Locusts were loaded into separate Hamilcar gliders between 17 and 20 March, and on the morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived in the vicinity of the landing zone without incident. During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, rendering it useless.

Six Locusts landed intact on the landing zone, including several with significant damage, but two of these tanks did not reach the rendezvous point chosen for the regiment. One undamaged tank came to the aid of a group of American paratroopers who were under fire from a German self-propelled gun but was rapidly knocked out by the German vehicle, wounding two crewmembers. A second tank broke down as it attempted to tow a jeep out of a crashed glider, although the crew remained with the tank and supported British airborne troops in the area. Of the four Locusts that reached the rendezvous point, only two were undamaged and fully fit for action; these two were immediately deployed to the high ground east of the Diersfordter Wald, while being covered by the two damaged tanks. Upon arrival they were engaged by German troops and had to be supported by an infantry company, and soon their presence began attracting a great deal of artillery and anti-tank fire. Although neither of the tanks were hit, a number of infantrymen were killed or wounded and after several hours the tanks were forced to withdraw. The four tanks and remaining infantry formed a small force that repelled several German attacks on their position, and were eventually relieved at 10:30 by a tank squadron from the 44th Royal Tank Regiment and elements of the rest of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.

===Post-war===

Operation Varsity was the only time the Locust was used in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. A report issued at the end of a conference held by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors. The 3 June 1946 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine has a five-photo article about Kamiel Dupre, an Illinois farmer who bought two surplus Locusts for $100 each from the Rock Island arsenal. Intending to use one as a farm tractor and one for spare parts, Dupre found the vehicles to be in poor condition and difficult to use and maintain. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

<doc id="335694" wikidata="Q500301" url="?curid=335694" title="M24 Chaffee">
<text>The M24 Chaffee (officially light tank M24) was an American light tank used during the later part of World War II; it was also used in post–World War II conflicts including the Korean War, and by the French in the War in Algeria and the First Indochina War. In British service it was given the service name &quot;Chaffee&quot; after the United States Army general, Adna R. Chaffee Jr., who helped develop the use of tanks in the United States armed forces. Although the M41 Walker Bulldog was developed as a replacement, M24s were not mostly removed from U.S. and NATO armies until the 1960s and remained in service with some Third World countries.

==Development and production history==
British combat experience in the North African campaign identified several shortcomings of the M3 Stuart light tank, especially the performance of its 37 mm cannon. A 75 mm gun was experimentally fitted to a howitzer motor carriage M8 – an M3 tank with a larger turret – and trials indicated that a 75 mm gun on the M5 light tank development of the M3 was possible. The M3/M5 design was dated though, and the 75 mm gun reduced storage space.

The T7 light tank design, which was initially seen as a replacement, grew in weight to more than 25 short tons, taking it out of the light tank classification, and so was designated as the Medium Tank M7. The weight increase without increased power gave it unsatisfactory performance; the program was stopped in March 1943 to allow standardization on a single medium tank – the M4 medium. This prompted the Ordnance Committee to issue a specification for a new light tank, with the same powertrain as the M5A1 but armed with a 75 mm gun.

In April 1943, the Ordnance Corps, together with Cadillac (who manufactured the M5), started work on the new project, designated &quot;Light Tank T24&quot;. The powerplant and transmission of the M5 were used together with some aspects of the T7. Efforts were made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The armor was extremely light and was sloped to maximize effectiveness. The turret armor was 25 mm thick with a 38 mm thick gun mantlet. The glacis plate was 25 mm thick. Side hull armor thickness varied: the frontal section was 25 mm thick but the rear third of the armor (which covered the engine compartment) was only 19 mm.

A new lightweight 75 mm gun was developed, a derivative of the gun used in the B-25H Mitchell bomber. The gun had the same ballistics as the 75 mm M3 in use by American tanks but used a thinly walled barrel and different recoil mechanism. The design featured tracks and torsion bar suspension, similar to the slightly earlier M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, which itself started in production in July 1943. The torsion bar system was to give a smoother ride than the vertical volute suspension used on most US armored vehicles. At the same time, the chassis was expected to be a standard used for other vehicles, such as self-propelled guns, and specialist vehicles; known together as the &quot;light combat team&quot;. It had a relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret.

On 15 October 1943, the first pilot vehicle was delivered. The design was judged a success and a contract for 1,000 was immediately raised by the Ordnance Department. This was subsequently increased to 5,000. Production began in 1944 under the designation &quot;Light Tank M24&quot;. It was produced at two sites; from April at Cadillac and from July at Massey-Harris. By the time production was stopped in August 1945, 4,731 M24s had been produced.

==Service history==

The M24 &quot;Chaffee&quot; was intended to replace the ageing and obsolete Light Tank M5 (&quot;Stuart&quot;), which was used in supplementary roles.

The first 34 M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to Troop F, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and Troop F, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which each received seventeen M24s. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank Battalion of the U.S. First Army.

The M24 started to enter widespread use in December 1944, but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war, the light tank companies of many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M3/M5 Stuart. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over. Aside from the US Army, the British Army was another main user of the Chaffee during the war, with at least several hundred obtained through the US Lend-Lease program. These saw action mainly in northwestern Europe and the North German Plain where British forces saw action against German troops.

Reports from the armored divisions that received them prior to the end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75 mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37 mm. The M24 was inferior in armor to German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required, especially in infantry support. The M24&#x27;s light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was minor, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions. At the end of WWII, the US Army displayed its Chaffees alongside the British Comet tanks and the Soviet IS-3 heavy tank, in the Berlin Victory Parade in 1945.

Pacific theater


===Korean War===

The M24 was virtually the only tank that the U.S. Far East Command could immediately dispatch to the Korean Peninsula at the time of the Korean War. During the same period, there were a total of four tank battalions (71st, 77th, 78th, and 79th) under the Far East Command, and each battalion maintained one company composed of M24s for the purpose of defending Japan&#x27;s narrow road network and bridges. The first battle took place on 10 July 1950, when A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion, assigned to the 24th Infantry Division, fought a North Korean tank and destroyed it while losing two.

The M24&#x27;s 75 mm main gun lacked penetration power against the frontal armor of the T-34-85. In addition, the armor of the M24 could be penetrated by the main guns of enemy tanks, artillery, and even anti-tank rifles used by the North Korean military. Moreover, most of the tanks dispatched from Japan had not been repaired for a long time, so turrets and main guns frequently broke down during battles. A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion, who first arrived on the Korean Peninsula, suffered heavy damage, with only two of the 14 tanks remaining in about a month. This unfavorable situation was resolved in August of the same year when U.S. medium tanks were finally deployed on the Korean Peninsula. All of the tanks units that operated the M24s were replaced with the M4A3E8. Afterward, the M24 was given to the reconnaissance squadron under the tank battalion or the infantry division for most of the period and was used for scouting purposes as it should have been.

===Non-US service===

Like other successful World War II designs, the M24 was supplied to many armies around the globe and was used in local conflicts long after it had been replaced in the US Army by the M41 Walker Bulldog.

France employed its M24s in Indo-China in infantry support missions, with good results. They employed ten M24s in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. In December 1953, ten disassembled Chaffees were transported by air to provide fire support to the garrison. They fired about 15,000 shells in the long siege that followed before the Viet Minh forces finally overcame the camp in May 1954, almost all being entirely worn out and badly damaged by the time the battle was over. France also deployed the M24 in Algeria, with some variants which fought there carrying an AMX-13 turret modified by France. Some former French and US Chaffees are known to have been passed down to the Army of South Vietnam, where they saw service at least until the Battle of Huế, with several serving as fixed gun emplacements outside vital military installations such as airbases.

The last time the M24 is known to have been in action was in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where 66 Pakistani Chaffees stationed in East Pakistan (today&#x27;s Bangladesh) were lost to Indian Army T-55s, PT-76s, and anti-tank teams, being easy prey for the better-equipped invading Indian forces. Although both Iran and Iraq had M24s prior to the Iran–Iraq War, there is no report of their use in that conflict. South Korean Chaffees saw limited service during the Korean War, often performing hit-and-run raids on communist forces. Cambodia, Laos, Japan and Taiwan were four other Asian nations to have operated Chaffees aside from South Vietnam, South Korea and Pakistan.

The Greek Army received 85 M24s from the U.S. from 1950 until 1970. The M24s initially were organized in two Tank Regiments numbered 392 and 393. In later years the Tank Regiments were reorganized in Tank Battalions with the same numbers. From 1962 till the early seventies the M24s in Tank Battalions were replaced with M47s and the M24s were used to equip Independent Reconnaissance Companies with an additional 121 M24s received from Italy in 1975. From 1991 till 1995 61 M24s were scrapped due to CFE Treaty limitations. The rest are abandoned in or outside military camps and one M24 is preserved in the Greek Army Tank Museum. One is on display outside the village of Metsovo (Μέτσοβο).

==Foreign variants==

===NM-116===
In 1972, the Norwegian Army decided to retain 54 of their 123 M24 light tanks as reconnaissance vehicles after they were substantially rebuilt under the designation NM-116. It was calculated that the NM-116 rebuilding program cost only about a third as much as contemporary light tanks.

This program was managed by the firm Thune-Eureka. The American firm NAPCO developed an improved power pack based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. The original 75 mm Gun M6 L/39 was replaced with a French D-925 90 mm low pressure gun, with a co-axial 0.50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun. The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A new fire-control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 laser rangefinder. Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116. The NM-116 were retired from service in 1993.

A few unconverted M24s were transferred to the Norwegian Home Guard and used in the defense of the former Fornebu Airport from 1974 well into the 1980s.

===Other variants===
The Chilean Army up-gunned their M24s in the mid-1980s to the IMI-OTO 60 mm hyper velocity medium support (HVMS) gun, with roughly comparable performance to a standard 90 mm gun. Chile operated this version until 1999. Uruguay continues to use the M24, modernized with new engines and 76 mm guns which can fire armor-piercing, fin stabilized, discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds. In the mid-1950s, in an attempt to improve the anti-tank performance of the vehicle, some French M24s had their turrets replaced with those of the AMX-13 light tank. AMX-13 variants with Chaffee turrets also existed. In the late-1960s, the JSDF modified a single M24 with four Type 64 ATGMs in order to improve its anti-tank capabilities.

<text>Lauda Air Luftfahrt GmbH, branded as Lauda Air, was an Austrian charter airline headquartered at Vienna Airport in Schwechat. It was owned by Niki Lauda (1949–2019) during much of its existence, later becoming a charter airline subsidiary for leisure operations of Austrian Airlines. On 6 April 2013, Lauda Air ceased to exist and was replaced by &quot;Austrian myHoliday&quot;, a new brand name that is used for flights and leisure offers provided by Austrian Airlines.

==History==
===Development as an independent airline===
Lauda Air was established in April 1979 by former Formula One world motor racing champion Niki Lauda with two Fokker F27s. In 1985, ITAS Austria purchased a 49% shareholding. Scheduled services began in 1988. In 1991 the fleet consisted of two Boeing 737-300s, two Boeing 767-300ERs and a Learjet 36. 

In May 1988, Lauda started its first long-haul flights from Vienna to Sydney and Melbourne via Bangkok. In the 1990s, it started to fly its Sydney and Melbourne flights via Kuala Lumpur and Bali. Daily flights to Dubai, Cuba, and Miami via Munich followed.

===Merger with Austrian Airlines===
Lauda Air became a wholly owned subsidiary of Austrian Airlines in December 2000 and employed thirty-five people as of March 2007. In 2005 the flight operation merged with Austrian Airlines, and the label &quot;Lauda Air&quot; operated charter flights within the Austrian Airlines Group.

At an AAG board meeting in November 2006, plans were approved to retire the Airbus wide-bodied fleet by mid-2007 and to operate with just a Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 fleet. As a result of subsequent fleet cuts, Austrian Airlines suspended some long-haul services and Lauda Air withdrew from the long-haul charter market over the next year. This led to a refocus on the short/medium-haul market and led to the addition of a 737-800 to take over most of the charter routes. Lauda Air also had an Italian subsidiary, Lauda Air S.p.A., which ended its operations in 2007.

Lauda Air was officially merged into Austrian Airlines on 1 July 2012. All aircraft within the group were transferred to Austrian Airlines on 1 July 2012, to be able to take advantage of Austrian Airlines structure.

The brand was retired at the start of the summer flight schedule on 31 March 2013, and was replaced by &quot;Austrian myHoliday&quot;. It is no longer an airline but a brand used to sell Austrian Airlines&#x27; own leisure offers.

Lauda Air also operated a fleet of three small jets, a Cessna Citation II (9 seats), a Bombardier Lear 60 (7 seats), and a Dassault Falcon 20 (12 seats). These were available for private charter flights.

== Incidents and accidents ==

Lauda Air suffered one fatal accident during its existence:
* On 26 May 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, operated by a Boeing 767-300ER registered as OE-LAV, named after &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&quot;, crashed in Thailand shortly after take-off from Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, due to the uncommanded deployment of one of its thrust reversers. This accident resulted in the deaths of all 223 passengers and crew.

<text>The M3 Lee, officially Medium Tank, M3, was an American medium tank used during World War II. The turret was produced in two different forms, one for US needs and one modified to British requirements to place the radio next to the commander. In British Commonwealth service, the tank was called by two names: tanks employing US-pattern turrets were called &quot;Lee&quot;, named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee, while those with British-pattern turrets were known as &quot;Grant&quot;, named after Union general Ulysses S. Grant.

Design commenced in July 1940, and the first M3s were operational in late 1941. The US Army needed a medium tank armed with a 75 mm gun and coupled with the United Kingdom&#x27;s immediate demand for 3,650 medium tanks, the Lee began production by late 1940. The design was a compromise meant to produce a tank as soon as possible and serve only until replaced by the following M4 Sherman tank. The M3 was reliable, had considerable firepower, good armor, and high mobility but had serious drawbacks in its general design and shape, including a high silhouette, an archaic sponson mounting of the main gun preventing the tank from taking a hull-down position, and riveted construction.

It was considered by Hans von Luck (a German army officer who wrote the post-war memoir &quot;Panzer Commander&quot;), to be superior in May 1942 to the Panzer IV and able to operate out of range of German 5 cm anti-tank guns. However, by mid-1943, with the introduction of upgunned Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, the tank had been withdrawn from combat in most theaters and replaced by the more capable M4 Sherman tank as soon as it became available in larger numbers. 

Despite its being replaced elsewhere, the British continued to use M3s in combat against the Japanese in southeast Asia until 1945. Nearly a thousand M3s were supplied to the Soviet military under Lend-Lease between 1941 and 1943.

==Development==
The U.S. funded tank development poorly during the interwar years, and had little experience in design as well as poor doctrine to guide design efforts. Only a few tanks were built (35 between 1920-1935). A new medium tank was designed in 1938, tested as the T5 and accepted as the M2 Medium. The M2 used a radial engine and vertical volute suspension among many of the features of the M2 light tank. 

In , the U.S. Army possessed approximately 400 tanks, mostly M2 Light Tanks, with 18 of the M2 Mediums as the only ones considered &quot;modern.&quot;

The M2 Medium Tank was typical of armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) many nations produced in 1939. By the time, the U.S. entered the war in 1941, the M2 design was already obsolete with a 37 mm gun, an impractical number of secondary machine guns, a very high silhouette, and frontal armor. 

At the end June 1940 the National Munitions Program was introduced to address the United States lack of readiness in case of war across all branches of the armed forces. The program specified the building of over 1,700 medium tanks by the end of 1941. In mid July, Armored Force under Brigadier General Adna R. Chaffee Jr. was formed to take over responsibility for tanks which had previously been split between the Infantry and Cavalry commands. Work was begun with industry to create the production facilities leading to a contract in August for Chrysler to build the Detroit Tank Arsenal which was expected to turn out 10 Medium M2A1 (an improved M2 Medium) per day.

However, the US Army&#x27;s assessment of the German Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks&#x27; success in the French campaign was that a 75mm gun was a necessity. The M2A1 could not be fitted with a 75mm weapon in its turret. Producing a new turret design would delay production and while it was decided to start work on a 75mm turret design, an interim solution was sought. An experimental modification of an improved M2 Medium into a self-propelled gun - the T5E2 - had been tested with a 75m pack howitzer in the front hull and it was decided to base the interim design on this work. The existing M2 hull could be used with a redesigned superstructure and the M2A1 37 mm turret. The contract for 1,000 M2A1s was cancelled and replaced with one for 1,000 M3s, though the M3 had not yet been designed. The Ordnance Department allocated 60 days for the design work. At the same time, the 75 mm gun design was started by Watervliet Arsenal; the new gun was based on the 75mm field gun.

The design was unusual because the main weapon – a larger caliber, medium-velocity 75 mm gun – was in an offset sponson mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was necessary because, at the time, American tank plants did not have the design experience necessary to make a gun turret capable of holding a 75 mm weapon. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37 mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a machine gun. The use of two main guns was a feature of the French Char B1 and the Mark I version of the British Churchill tank. In the French tank, it had been designed as a self-propelled gun to attack fortifications and an anti-tank capability had been added through a second gun in a small turret; the Churchill carried a gun in the front hull to fire chiefly smoke shells. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern, having a dual-purpose main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for effectively piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull-mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank with the same gun in a turret. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain urgently needed tanks. A drawback of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a hull-down position and use its 75 mm gun at the same time.

The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret basket to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. It was originally developed at the Rock Island Arsenal for T5 Phase III in 1938 but in 1940 Spicer Manufacturing Company was contracted to refine the design before serial production. Since Spicer themselves were busy producing transmissions for the light tanks, Mack Manufacturing from 1940, and Iowa Transmission Co. (a Deere subsidiary in Waterloo) from 1941 were tasked with manufacturing it. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of . After some experiments with hydraulically powered steering on the earliest M3s mechanical long-lever operation was adopted for production.

The vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system in the form of an electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.
The 75 mm gun was operated by a gunner and a loader; sighting the gun used an M1 periscope – with an integral telescope – on the top of the sponson. The periscope rotated with the gun. The sight was marked from zero to , with vertical markings to aid deflection shooting at a moving target. The gunner laid the gun on target through geared handwheels for traverse (15° to left and to right) and elevation ( +20° to -9°). The shorter barreled 75 mm M2 cannon sometimes had a counterweight added at the end of the barrel to balance the gun for operation with the gyrostabilizer until the longer 75 mm M3 variant was brought into use.

The 37 mm gun was aimed through the M2 periscope, mounted in the mantlet to the side of the gun. It also sighted the coaxial machine gun. Two range scales were provided: 0– for the 37 mm and 0– for the machine gun. The 37 mm gun also featured a counterweight – a long rod under the barrel – though it was ill maintained by crews who knew little about its use.
There were also two .30-06 (7.62 mm caliber) Browning M1919A4 machine guns mounted in the hull, fixed in traverse but adjustable in elevation, which were controlled by the driver. These were, due to coordination issues, removed, though they would be seen on early Sherman tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Outside&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not at war, the U.S. was willing to produce, sell and ship munitions including armored vehicles to Britain. The British had requested that their Matilda II infantry tank and Crusader cruiser tank designs be made by American factories, but this request was refused. With much of their equipment left in France after the British Army was evacuated from Dunkirk, the equipment needs of the British were acute. Though not entirely satisfied with the design, they ordered the M3 in large numbers. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified features that they considered flaws – the high profile, the hull mounted main gun, the radio position in the hull rather than in the turret, the riveted armor plating (whose rivets tended to pop off inside the interior in a deadly ricochet when the tank was hit even by non-penetrating rounds), the smooth track design, insufficient armor and lack of splash-proofing of the joints.

The British desired modifications for the tank they were purchasing. A bustle rack was to be made at the back of the turret to house the Wireless Set No. 19. The turret was to be given thicker armor than in the original U.S. design, and the machine gun cupola was to be replaced with a simple hatch. Extended space within the turret of the new M3 also allowed the use of a smoke bomb launcher, although the addition of the radio would take the space for storage of fifty 37 mm rounds, reducing the ammunition capacity for that gun to 128 rounds. Several of these new &quot;Grant&quot; tanks would also be equipped with sand shields for action in North Africa, though they often fell off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Inside&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With these modifications accepted, the British ordered 2,000 Grants, with 1,685 ultimately built.

Contracts were arranged with four US companies for 500 tanks each: Baldwin Locomotive Company, Pullman Standard Car Company, Pressed Steel Car Company and Lima Locomotive Company. The total cost of the orders was approximately US$240 million ($120,000 per piece), including funds for factory re-tooling. That was the total of all UK government funds held in the US; it took the US Lend-Lease act to solve the financial shortfall and fund future equipment orders (for comparison, Lend-Lease cost of a M3 was $64,814). The order with Baldwin was later increased from 500 to 685. Lima did not produce a single Grant against its contract as it took the company so long to complete the steam locomotives already in production to create factory space and to tool-up that M3 production was winding down before it was ready. It was therefore agreed that Lima would supply 500 of the new M4 Sherman instead. Lima actually undertook the T6/M4 development while it was unable to manufacture the Grant and, as the other companies were all too busy, was the first company to begin producing the M4 in March 1942 with the M4A1 variant. The first 28 M4A1s built were British contract tanks as Grant replacements but the remainder of the order was subsumed into Lend-Lease.

The prototype M3 was completed in March 1941 and production models followed, with the first British-specification tanks produced in July. Both U.S. and British tanks had thicker armor than first planned. The British design required one fewer crew member than the US version due to the radio in the turret. The U.S. eventually eliminated the full-time radio operator, assigning the task to the driver. After extensive losses in Africa and Greece, the British realized that to meet their needs for tanks, they would have to take both the Lee and the Grant types.

The U.S. military used the &quot;M&quot; (Model) letter to designate nearly all of its equipment. When the British Army received its new M3 medium tanks from the US, confusion immediately set in between the different M3 medium tank and M3 light tank. The British Army was in the process of using names for its own tanks instead of designations and named its American tanks after American military figures, although the U.S. Army never used those terms until after the war. M3 tanks with the cast turret and radio setup received the name &quot;General Grant&quot;, while the original M3s were called &quot;General Lee&quot;, or more usually just &quot;Grant&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot;.

The chassis and running gear of the M3 design was adapted by the Canadians for their Ram tank. The hull of the M3 was also used for self-propelled artillery as with the original design of the M7 Priest, of which nearly 3,500 were built, and recovery vehicles.

==Production==
In addition to the Detroit arsenal, American Locomotive and Baldwin Locomotive were brought into the production scheme in October 1940 Neither company needed to also build a factory and so their first tanks were complete - a bit before Detroit&#x27;s - in April 1941. Even then the shortage of components meant that after American Locomotive&#x27;s ceremonial driving of its first tank before senior officials, the transmission was removed and sent to Baldwin so that they could carry out a similar ceremony a few days later. The British placed contracts for the Grant with Baldwin, Lima Locomotive and Pullman-Standard in October 1940

Canada did place an order with Montreal Locomotive Works, a subsidiary of American Locomotive, for the production of over 1000 M3s. but in January this turned into design and production of the Ram tank which was based on the M3 lower hull and suspension. 

==Operational history==
Of the 6,258 M3 variants manufactured, 2,887 (45%) were supplied to the British government for use by British and Commonwealth forces. 1,685 of these were Grants which the UK ordered directly from US industry for cash and which did not fall under the Lend-Lease arrangements.

The M3 Grant first saw action with units of the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa during the Gazala battles of May 1942. However, with the arrival of the M4 Sherman tank from October 1942 the surviving M3s in North Africa became surplus and were mostly shipped on to India. 657 Grants and 75 Lees were supplied directly to North Africa.

Ninety-seven Grants and 119 M3 Lees - including 49 diesel M3A3 Lee Vs, the only diesel Lees used by UK and Commonwealth forces - were supplied directly to the UK and were used for testing and training. 335 were later converted to Canal Defense Lights (no diesels), and further refurbished turretless M3 hulls were supplied by the US to support this project.

777 were supplied directly to the Australian Army for home defense and training duties in Australia. None were used operationally. These comprised 255 Lee Is, 266 Grant Is and 232 Grant IIs.
The British Indian Army received 896 M3 series tanks as new supply and tanks shipped from North Africa. These comprised 517 Lee Is and 379 Grant Is.

A further 1,386 were exported to the Soviet Union, although only 957 of these reached Russian ports due to German U-boat and air attacks on Allied convoys.

===North African campaign===
The M3 brought much-needed firepower to British forces in the campaign in the North African desert. Early Grants were shipped directly to Egypt and lacked some fitments (such as radio) that were remedied locally. Under the &quot;Mechanisation Experimental Establishment (Middle East)&quot; other modifications were tested approved and made to tanks as they were issued. These included fitting of sand shields (later deliveries from the US had factory fitted shields), dust covers for the gun mantlets and the removal of the hull machine guns. Ammunition stowage was altered to 80 x 75 mm (up from 50) and 80 x 37 mm with additional protection to the ammunition bins.

Grants arrived in North Africa by the end of January 1942, and British crews began training on them. As it was developed from the World War I-era French 75 mm gun, the British had ammunition stocks left over from then that could be used for the 75 mm M2 gun but these suffered due to age. The armor-piercing shell for the 75 mm was a solid shot and could penetrate around 2 inches (50 mm) of armor at 1,000 m, which was better than the 2-pounder guns of British tanks, but better performance was desired. Fortunately, large numbers of German 75 mm shells were captured, and these were matched to the American cartridge. This conversion gave improved performance and was followed by an improved American AP shell design (the M61). While the Grants had been expected to be a temporary until the Crusader Mark III tank with a 57 mm 6-pounder gun was available, problems with the Crusader led to changes. The Grant became the main tank in use, and cruiser tanks such as the Crusader Mk I and II replaced the M3 light tank in British units.
The M3 tank&#x27;s first action during the war was in 1942 during the North African Campaign. British Lees and Grants were in action against Rommel&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Gazala on 27 May. In the preparations for the battle the Eighth Army received 167 M3 tanks. The 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, 3rd and 5th battalions Royal Tank Regiment went into action with Grant tanks. Retreating in the face of a large attack, the 8th Hussars had only three Grants remaining, while 3rd RTR reported losing 16.

Their appearance was a surprise to the Germans, who were unprepared for the M3&#x27;s 75 mm gun. They soon discovered the M3 could engage them beyond the effective range of their 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun, and the 5 cm KwK 39 of the Panzer III, their main medium tank. The M3 was also vastly superior to the Fiat M13/40 and M14/41 tanks employed by the Italian troops, whose 47 mm gun was effective only at point-blank range, while only the few Semoventi &quot;da&quot; 75/18 self-propelled guns were able to destroy it using HEAT rounds. In addition to the M3&#x27;s superior range, they were equipped with high explosive shells for infantry and other soft targets, which previous British tanks had lacked; upon the introduction of the M3, Rommel noted: &quot;Up to May of 1942, our tanks had in general been superior in quality to the corresponding British types. This was now no longer true, at least not to the same extent.&quot;

Despite the M3&#x27;s advantages and surprise appearance during the Battle of Gazala, it could not win the battle for the British. In particular, the high-velocity 88 mm anti-aircraft gun, in use as its secondary role of an anti-tank gun, proved deadly if British tanks attacked without artillery support. Britain&#x27;s Director of Armoured Fighting Vehicles nonetheless said before the M4 Sherman arrived that &quot;The Grants and the Lees have proven to be the mainstay of the fighting forces in the Middle East; their great reliability, powerful armament and sound armor have endeared them to the troops.&quot;

By the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, there were 600 M3s, of both types, in British service. Some of these were used for training in the UK.

Grants and Lees served with British units in North Africa until the end of the campaign. Following Operation Torch (the invasion of French North Africa), the US also fought in North Africa using the M3 Lee.

The US 1st Armored Division had been issued the new M4 Sherman, but had given up one regiment&#x27;s worth to the British Army so that it could use them in the Second Battle of El Alamein (October-November 1942). Consequently, a regiment of the division was still using the M3 Lee when it arrived in North Africa.

The M3 was generally appreciated during the North African campaign for its mechanical reliability, good armor protection, and heavy firepower. In all three aspects, the M3 was capable of engaging German tanks and towed anti-tank guns.

However, the high silhouette and low, hull-mounted 75 mm were tactical drawbacks since they prevented fighting from a hull-down firing position. In addition, the use of riveted hull superstructure armor on the early versions led to spalling, where the impact of enemy shells caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank. Later models were built with all-welded armor to eliminate this problem. These lessons had already been applied to the design and production of the M4.

The M3 was replaced in front-line roles by the Sherman as soon as it became available. However, several specialist vehicles based on the M3 were later employed in Europe, such as the M31 armored recovery vehicle and the Canal Defence Light.

In early 1943, the British Eight Army&#x27;s M3s, now replaced by the Sherman, were shipped to the Pacific theatre to replace some Matildas in the Australian Army.

===Eastern Europe—Soviet service===
Beginning from 1941, 1,386 M3 medium tanks were shipped from the US to the Soviet Union, with 417 lost when their transporting vessels were sunk by German submarine, naval and aerial attacks en route. These were supplied through the American Lend-Lease program between 1942 and 1943.

Soviet Red Army personnel tended to refer to the M3 as the &quot;Grant&quot;, even though all of the M3s shipped to Russia were &quot;Lee&quot; variants. The official Soviet designation for it was the &quot;М3 средний&quot; (&quot;М3с&quot;), or &quot;M3 Medium&quot;, to distinguish the Lee from the US-built M3 Stuart light tank, which was also acquired by the USSR under Lend-Lease and was officially known there as the &quot;М3 лёгкий&quot; (&quot;М3л&quot;), or &quot;M3 Light&quot;. 

Due to the vehicle&#x27;s petrol-fueled engine, a high tendency to catch fire, and its vulnerability against most types of German armor the Soviet troops encountered from 1942 onwards, the tank was almost entirely unpopular with the Red Army since its introduction in the Eastern Front. In the letter sent to Franklin Roosevelt (18 July 1942), Stalin wrote: &quot;I consider it my duty to warn you that, according to our experts at the front, U.S. tanks catch fire very easily when hit from behind or from the side by anti-tank rifle bullets. The reason is that the high-grade gasoline used forms inside the tank a thick layer of highly inflammable fumes.&quot;

With almost 1,500 Russian T-34 tanks being built every month, Soviet use of the M3 medium tank declined soon after mid-1943. Soviet troops still fielded their Lee/Grant tanks on secondary and less active fronts, such as in the Arctic region during the Red Army&#x27;s Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive against German forces in Norway in October 1944, where the obsolete US tanks faced mainly captured French tanks used by the Germans, such as the SOMUA S35, which to a limited extent was somewhat comparable to the Lee/Grant it fought against.

===Pacific War===
In the Pacific War, armor played a relatively minor role for the Allies as well as for the Japanese, compared with that of naval, air, and infantry units.

In the Pacific Ocean Theater and the Southwest Pacific Theater, the US Army deployed none of its dedicated armored divisions and only a third of its 70 separate tank battalions.

A small number of M3 Lees saw action in the central Pacific Ocean Theater in 1943. The US Marine Corps, bypassed the M3 Lees, switching from M3 Stuarts directly to M4 Shermans in mid-1944.

Some M3 Grants played an offensive role with the British Indian Army, in the south-east Asian theater.

The Australian Army also used Grants during World War II, mainly for homeland defense and training purposes.

=== Pacific Ocean Theater ===
The only combat use of the M3 Lee by the US Army against Japanese forces occurred during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign of 1943.

Following the better-known landing at Tarawa, the US 27th Infantry Division made an amphibious assault on Makin Island with armored support from a platoon of M3A5 Lees equipped with deep-wading kits belonging to the US Army&#x27;s 193rd Tank Battalion.

=== Burma ===
After British Commonwealth forces in Europe and the Mediterranean began receiving M4 Shermans, about 900 British-ordered M3 Lees/Grants were shipped to the Indian Army. Some of these saw action against Japanese troops and tanks in the Burma Campaign.

They were used by the British Fourteenth Army until the fall of Rangoon, regarded as performing &quot;admirably&quot; in their original intended role of supporting infantry in Burma between 1944 and 1945. It played a pivotal role during the Battle of Imphal, during which the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 14th Tank Regiment (primarily equipped with their own Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, together with a handful of captured British M3 Stuart light tanks) encountered M3 medium tanks for the first time and found their light tanks outgunned and outmatched. The British M3 tanks performed well as they traversed the steep hillsides around Imphal and defeated the assaulting Japanese forces. Officially declared obsolete in April 1944, nevertheless, the Lee/Grant saw action until the end of the war in September 1945.

=== Australia ===
At the beginning of the war, Australian Army doctrine viewed tank units as minor offensive components within infantry divisions. It had no dedicated armored branch and most of its very limited capabilities in tank warfare had been deployed to the North African Campaign (i.e. three divisional cavalry battalions). By early 1941, the effectiveness of large-scale German panzer attacks had been recognized, and a dedicated armored mustering was formed. The Australian Armoured Corps initially included the cadres of three armored divisions – all of which were equipped at least partly with M3 Grants made available from surplus British orders.

The 1st Australian Armoured Division was formed with a view towards complementing the three Australian infantry divisions then in North Africa. However, following the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, the division was retained in Australia. During April–May 1942, the 1st Armoured Division&#x27;s regiments were reported to be re-equipping with M3 Grants and were training, in a series of large exercises, in the area around Narrabri.

The cadres of the 2nd and 3rd Armoured Divisions were both officially formed in 1942, as Militia (reserve/home defense) units. These divisions were also partly equipped with M3 Grants.

In January 1943, the main body of the 1st Armoured Division was deployed to home defense duties between Perth and Geraldton, where it formed part of III Corps.

By the middle of the war, the Australian Army had deemed the Grant to be unsuitable for combat duties overseas, and M3 units were re-equipped with the Matilda II before being deployed to the New Guinea and Borneo Campaigns. Due to personnel shortages, all three divisions were officially disbanded during 1943 and downgraded to brigade- and battalion-level units.

====Post-war use in Australia====
During the war, the Australian Army had converted some M3 Grants for special purposes, including a small number of bulldozer variants, beach armoured recovery vehicles, and wader prototypes.

Following the end of the war, 14 of the Australian M3A5 Grants were converted to a local self-propelled gun design, the Yeramba. Until the future acquisition of the AS9 Huntsman is complete, the Yeramba remains as the only SPG ever deployed by the Australian Army. Fitted with a 25-pounder field gun, the Yerambas remained in service with the 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, until the late 1950s.

Many M3s deemed surplus to Australian Army requirements were acquired by civilian buyers during the 1950s and 1960s for conversion to earthmoving equipment and tractors.

===Conclusion===
Overall, the M3 was able to be effective on the battlefield from 1942 until 1943. However, US armored units lacked the tactical expertise to overcome its design. Its armor and firepower were equal or superior to most of the threats it faced, especially in the Pacific. Long-range, high-velocity guns were not yet common on German tanks in the African theater. However, the rapid pace of tank development meant that the M3 was very quickly outclassed. By mid-1942, with the introduction of the German Tiger I, the up-gunning of the Panzer IV to a long 75 mm gun, and the first appearance in 1943 of the Panther, along with the availability of large numbers of the M4 Sherman, the M3 was withdrawn from service in the European theater.

<doc id="335703" wikidata="Q192653" url="?curid=335703" title="Czech Airlines">
<text>Czech Airlines (abbreviation: ČSA, ) is a Czech aviation brand and privately held holding company. Between 1923 and 2024, it operated as an independent airline and served as the flag carrier of the Czech Republic. Czech Airlines ended its own flight operations on 26 October 2024, handing them over to Smartwings while being repurposed into a holding company.

ČSA was the fifth oldest airline in the world, after Dutch KLM (1919), Colombian Avianca (1919), Australian Qantas (1920), and Soviet/Russian Aeroflot (1923). It was the first airline in the world to fly regular jet-only routes (between Prague and Moscow). The airline ran a frequent flyer programme called &quot;OK Plus&quot; about the airline&#x27;s International Air Transport Association designation, as well as the term of approval; OK also featured prominently in its previous livery, and was the prefix of Czech aircraft registrations. It was a member of the SkyTeam alliance. Its hub was Václav Havel Airport Prague.

When, in 2018, 97.74% of Czech Airlines was bought by the privately owned Smartwings, ČSA became a part of the Smartwings Group. The remaining 2.26% of ČSA was owned by insurance company Česká Pojišťovna. ČSA filed for bankruptcy in March 2021 and went through an extensive business restructuring, exiting in June 2022. As of 2022, ČSA was under a new ownership structure with a new parent company called Prague City Air s.r.o. owning 70% of the company, with Smartwings retaining the remaining 30%.

On 26 October 2024, Czech Airlines became the parent (holding) company of Smartwings. As part of this transition, Smartwings took over the operational management of flights previously operated by Czech Airlines. The last scheduled flight of Czech Airlines was flight OK767 from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Václav Havel Airport Prague, operated by an Airbus A320-214 registered OK-IOO. Following the flight&#x27;s departure, &quot;Featured flight alert&quot; notifications were sent out to users of the ADS-B flight tracker Flightradar24 application for flight OK767, the last flight of Czech Airlines. As of 2024, 2 aircraft fly under the Czech Airlines brand.

== History ==


===Early years===
ČSA was founded on 6 October 1923 by the Czechoslovak government as ČSA Československé státní aerolinie (Czechoslovak State Airlines). Twenty-three days later, its first transport flight took place, flying between Prague and Bratislava. It only operated domestic services until its first international flight from Prague to Bratislava and on to Zagreb in Yugoslavia in 1930. After the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1939 and splitting the country into three parts, the airline was dissolved.

Following a coup in February 1948, the Czechoslovak Communist Party suspended some of ČSA&#x27;s western European and Middle Eastern routes and also gradually replaced much of the fleet with Soviet-built airliners, due to the embargo imposed by the West on the western-built aircraft spares and other equipment. The Ilyushin Il-14 was updated and built under licence in Czechoslovakia as the Avia-14.

In 1950, ČSA became the world&#x27;s first victim of a mass hijacking. Three Czechoslovak Douglas DC-3 airliners flown to an American air base at Erding, near Munich, stirred the world on both sides of the &quot;burnt through&quot; Iron Curtain and the case intensified the Cold War between East and West overnight. On the morning of 24 March, the three aircraft landed near Munich instead of at Prague; the first from Brno, at 08:20, the second from Moravská Ostrava at 08:40, and the third from Bratislava at 09:20. Two-thirds of the people on board were unwilling participants and later returned to Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak Communist government commissioned a &#x27;flight to freedom&#x27; book, stage play, and film (all bearing the name &quot;Kidnap to Erding&quot;) which celebrated the kidnapped returnees as heroes who had not allowed themselves to be swayed by promises of capitalist opulence. Those who remained and requested political asylum in West Germany were proclaimed criminals for whom the Prague government vigorously requested extradition – in vain. The pilot from Brno was Josef Klesnil, a former Royal Air Force pilot with 311 squadron, who flew from Brno to Erding with a pistol pointed at his head.

In 1957, ČSA became the third airline to fly jet services, taking delivery of and putting into service the very first Tupolev Tu-104A that year. ČSA was the only airline other than Aeroflot to operate the Tu-104. The Tu-104A service that began in 1957 between Prague and Moscow was the first jet-only connection (other airlines used both jets and piston/turboprop aircraft). The airline&#x27;s first transatlantic services started on 3 February 1962 with a flight to Havana using a Bristol Britannia turboprop leased from Cubana de Aviación. ČSA&#x27;s transatlantic flights were code-shared with Cubana&#x27;s services to Prague, and Cubana&#x27;s crews provided initial training and assistance in the operation of the Britannia.

===1960 to 1990===
From the late 1960s, ČSA used a range of Soviet-built aircraft and modified versions for its extensive European and intercontinental services, totalling some 50 international and 15 domestic destinations. The Britannia was replaced with shorter-range Ilyushin Il-18D turboprops at this time, and transatlantic routes were established to Montreal and New York City in addition to Havana, with refuelling stops at Shannon (Eire) and Gander (Newfoundland). Along with the Il-18D, aircraft in ČSA&#x27;s fleet included the short-range Tupolev Tu-134, medium-range Tupolev Tu-154, and long-range Ilyushin Il-62. As with several other airlines, the Il-62 was the first long-range jet airliner to be put into operation by ČSA (also the first foreign customer to buy Il-62s from the USSR). ČSA operated a fleet of 21 Il-62s between 1969 and 1997, including six Il-62Ms. A ČSA-registered Il-62 and three Il-62Ms were used as official Czechoslovak and Czech government transports between 1974 and 1996.

After absorbing the &quot;heavier&quot; part of Slov-Air and taking its Let L-410A Turbolet turboprop commuters into its fleet in the early 1970s, ČSA partner airliner Slov-Air became the world&#x27;s first to have a captain, Ján Mičica, slain at the controls by a hijacker, during a hijacking to West Germany. The aircraft involved, OK-ADN, is currently displayed in an open-air aircraft museum in Martin, Slovakia.

===The 1990s and 2000s===
On 1 January 1991, Czechoslovakian Airlines split into two companies: Czechoslovakian Airlines, which would become Czech Airlines, and Slov Air, which had previously been a subsidiary of the original Czechoslovakian Airlines. The division of Czechoslovakian Airlines ownership in 1991 between the governing bodies of the Czech and Slovak parts of Czechoslovakia had no connection to the split of Czechoslovakia two years later, in January 1993.

The post-split Czechoslovakian Airlines became privatized in 1992. Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development owned 19.1% of shares of the new company, while the Fund of National Ownership of the Czech Republic owned 49.3%. Czech Insurance Company owned 4.5%, the city of Prague owned 3.5%, and the last 2.3% was split evenly between three Slovakian cities: Bratislava, Kosice, and Poprad. 
After the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation, the airline in May 1995 adopted its present name. By the late 1990s, most of its Soviet aircraft had either been sold to other airlines or retired (a number were preserved), replaced with Western models such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A310 and Airbus A320. ČSA became a full member of the SkyTeam alliance on 18 October 2000. As of March 2007, the airline, with 5,440 employees, was owned by the Czech Ministry of Finance (56.92%), the Czech Consolidation Agency (34.59%), and other Czech institutions.

On 1 January 2010, the whole non-office ground staff of ČSA was transferred to the ČSA Support subsidiary, now named Czech Airlines Handling S.R.O. In February 2010, ČSA sold off its duty-free shops to another entity.

EU competition regulators began an investigation into Czech Airlines on 23 February 2011, stating that it doubted the loss-making concern could return to viability and comply with European Union state aid regulations.

In late 2012, ČSA Czech Airlines announced expansion plans and the resumption of long-haul flights in summer 2013 with Airbus A330 aircraft between Prague and Seoul. Starting in March 2013, it operated direct flights from Prague to Perm, Nice, Munich, Zurich, Seoul, and Florence.

After stock sales to Korean Air on 10 April 2013, ČSA Czech Airlines was owned by Czech Aeroholdings a.s. (56%) and Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. (44%). On May 14, 2013, Czech Airlines Extraordinary General shareholders&#x27; meeting elected Cho Won-tae as a new member of its supervisory board. Cho replaced Petr Matousek, who resigned from his position on the supervisory board. This personnel change took effect on 1 June 2013 as a result of Korean Air&#x27;s equity purchase.

In April 2015, Travel Service Group bought 34% of the airline, over which Korean Air had an option. In 2016, the airline returned to profit for the first time in several years.

On 6 October 2017, Korean Air announced the sale of its 44 percent stake in Czech Airlines, which it had held for four years, to Travel Service. Travel Service by then owned 78.9 percent of ČSA. Czech state company Prisko owned 20 percent of ČSA. Travel Service later also acquired Prisko&#x27;s stake, increasing its stake to 97.74%.

In 2014, the airline sold its Airbus 320s, as it had become unprofitable to fly them due to low load factor and high maintenance costs. In the summer of 2015, the fleet consisted of seventeen planes: seven Turboprops, nine Airbus A319s, and one long-haul Airbus A330 that was leased to the airline by Korean Air. 

In 2016, the airline transported 2.26 million passengers, a 13% increase from 2015. The average load factor increased from 10% to 75%, and the total number of flights increased by 9%. In the same year, the airline ordered six A320 Neo models, which was later reduced to three in 2019, and then converted into three orders for the Airbus A321XLR model instead at the beginning of 2020, with plans to launch North American Routes. Manufacturer Airbus planned to deliver the planes in 2023 and 2024. However, the airline cancelled the order due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The airline operated a fleet of eighteen planes over the summer of 2017 to a total of fifty different destinations, including twenty-five distinct European and Asian countries, the most extensive coverage since the global financial crisis.

From the fall of 2018 through the winter of 2019, Smartwings Group management eliminated many airline routes, including the Prague-Bratislava and Prague-Ostrava routes that the airline has been flying since its inception. Soon after, profitable routes into select Russian cities were eliminated and immediately replaced by new routes operated by Smartwings. 

Under the leadership of the Smartwings Group, the Czech Airline&#x27;s fleet was planned to be transformed into a fully integrated Boeing 737 fleet, the same model that the Smartwings fleet used. However, due to technical and safety issues in the Boeing 737 Max model found in early 2019, management decided that Czech Airlines would operate the ongoing Airbus Fleet while Smartwings would operate a Boeing fleet. In April 2019, the fleet experienced a reduction of three out of the four operating Airbus 319s. However, one of these was later reintroduced.  

===Latest developments===
In March 2019, Smartwings announced that ČSA would undergo a fleet transition, with the Airbus A319 and ATR 72 to be retired. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Czech Airlines announced in April 2020 the end of its already suspended sole long-haul route to Seoul. Thus its sole Airbus A330 was to be returned to lessor Korean Air by October 2020.

Towards the end of January 2020, the airline announced a plan to expand and modernize the fleet, with the planned addition of four new Airbus A320s. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these plans were abandoned. In the early stages of the pandemic, the company&#x27;s workforce declined from 700 to 300 employees, and by the end of the year, the active fleet declined from five planes to two, both of which were under lease, flying to only five European destinations.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ČSA fell into insolvency, applying for a moratorium in August 2020. In February 2021, a maintenance provider ordered the seizure of two Czech Airlines&#x27; ATR 72-500 in Prague over unpaid debts. Before the incident, near the end of the moratorium, majority owner Smartwings announced that Czech Airlines faced insolvency should it not receive state financial aid, but the aid raised controversy. That same month, the airline notified the Czech Employment Office that it might lay off its entire workforce of some 430 people. In March 2021, it added that it had no means to meet its financial obligations and filed for bankruptcy.

In March 2021, ČSA announced the immediate retirement of all ATR 72-500 aircraft, considerably shrinking its remaining fleet. At the end of August 2021, ČSA was operating just one Airbus A320 aircraft; the second was inoperable. As of summer 2022, Czech Airlines had reduced its network to just three scheduled routes. In 2023, the only route operated by Czech Airlines was from Prague-Paris.

In June 2022, ČSA exited business restructuring under a new ownership structure. Prague City Air, founded under the aid of Smartwings shareholders Jiří Šimáně and Roman Vik, was created to own 70% of ČSA while current majority shareholder Smartwings retained 30%. As of late 2022, the airline also planned to rebuild its fleet and route network using Airbus A320 and newly acquired Airbus A220 aircraft. On 20 February 2024, Prague City Air s.r.o. purchased 49.92% shares in Smartwings a.s. from Rainbow Wisdom Investment Limited. Smartwings spokeswoman Vladimíra Dufková announced that the Czech shareholders now own 100% of the shares in both Smartwings and CSA Czech Airlines.

In October 2024, Czech Airlines was restructured into a holding company, with Smartwings taking over all flight operations under both brand names. The Czech Airlines brand remains active, with two Airbus A320 aircraft in its livery currently in operation. Additionally, four Airbus A220 aircraft in Czech Airlines colors are scheduled for delivery in the upcoming months.

On October 26, the last flight of ČSA took place, as it took off in the evening from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris to Prague Václav Havel Airport. This was the last flight under what has become to be known as its iconic &quot;OK&quot; flight call.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===
In 2016, Czech Airlines head office moved to Evropská Street in 6th district, Prague, Vokovice district to lower overhead. Czech Airlines formerly had its head office, the APC Building, on the grounds of Václav Havel Airport Prague in Ruzyně, 6th district, Prague. On 30 December 2009, ČSA announced it would sell its head office to the airport for CZK 607 million. Before the insolvency application, in February 2021, Czech Airlines moved its headquarters to the Smartwings building at Prague airport.

===Former subsidiaries===

*Czech Airlines Handling provided ground handling or passenger and aircraft handling for many airlines operating flights from Prague.
*Czech Airlines Technics provided aircraft maintenance and regular certified servicing for the Czech Airlines fleet and other airlines.
*Czech Aviation Training Centre provided training to future aircrew members, as well as refresher and further training to existing crews operated by the state-owned enterprise Air Navigation Services of the Czech Republic. In addition to Czech Airlines, services of the training centre were also used by other airlines. Furthermore, &quot;Flying without Fear&quot; and &quot;Stewardess/Steward Try-outs&quot; courses were offered, as well as the &quot;Flying for Fun&quot; adventure course. These special events were also open to the public.
*Holidays Czech Airlines, a defunct charter subsidiary, focused mainly on flying to holiday destinations such as Greece, Turkey and Spain. The airline launched on 1 June 2010 and ceased in July 2014.

===Financial results===
Since its transformation to a joint-stock company in August 1992, ČSA has never paid dividends. The sale of a minority share to Air France was a fiasco, and the French airline withdrew. Subsequently, Antonín Jakubše and Miroslav Kůla stabilized the company and enlarged its fleet. In September 2003, Miroslav Kůla was fired. New CEO and ex-minister Jaroslav Tvrdík agreed with the unions to increase wages by a third and announced an &quot;unprecedented&quot; enlargement of the fleet.

In 2005, the financial situation sharply deteriorated. Although the sale of two ATR aircraft improved operating results by CZK 198 million, the operating loss was almost half a billion Czech crowns and the Government of Jiří Paroubek replaced Jaroslav Tvrdík with Radomír Lašák. The airline generated further operating losses, despite revenues of CZK 2.1 bn from the sale of almost all real estate and CZK 1.2 bn from aircraft sales. In 2005–2010, ČSA generated an operating loss of CZK 3.4 bn; without long-term asset sale revenues, the operating loss would have been twice as large. The gross margin did not even cover personnel expenses.

In 2016, the airline handled 2.7 million passengers and announced a net profit of 241 million crowns.

===Corporate identity===
====Logo====
A new look for Czech Airlines was revealed in September 2007. The new logo was created by Michal Kotyza, who works for the airline.

====Livery====
===On-board services===
Czech Airlines offered buy on board service on some flights in addition to free service.

===Frequent-flyer program===
The OK Plus frequent flyer programme gave passengers &quot;OK Plus Miles&quot; for flights with Czech Airlines, SkyTeam member airlines, other partner airlines or non-airline partners. OK Plus membership cards were available with the following tier levels: OK Plus membership, OK Plus Silver, OK Plus Gold, and OK Plus Platinum. The higher the card level, the greater the number of benefits passengers receive. CSA terminated its OK Plus program in October 2024, without implementing a replacement scheme.

==Destinations==
===Scheduled flights===
As of February 2021, Czech Airlines served four scheduled year-round and seasonal destinations including their home base at Václav Havel Airport Prague. This figure was down from 33 routes in summer 2019. Flights were operated mainly in Europe, with Beirut being the sole remaining Middle Eastern destination. ČSA offered more than 110 destinations and 45 countries from Prague, but none of the long-haul service via its codeshare partners.

As of October 2024, routes to Paris and Madrid are operated by Smartwings under the Czech Airlines brand using two Airbus A320 aircraft in Czech Airlines livery.

===Charter flights===
In June 2007, ČSA signed a contract with Dxim Tours, the largest Czech travel agency, extending their contract for another three years. In May 2010, ČSA withdrew its last Airbus A310 used for these services.

<text>Connections between mathematics and God include the use of mathematics in arguments about the existence of God and about whether belief in God is beneficial.

==Mathematical arguments for God&#x27;s existence==
In the 1070s, Anselm of Canterbury, an Italian medieval philosopher and theologian, created an ontological argument which sought to use logic to prove the existence of God. A more elaborate version was given by Gottfried Leibniz in the early eighteenth century. Kurt Gödel created a formalization of Leibniz&#x27; version, known as Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof.

A more recent argument was made by Stephen D. Unwin in 2003, who suggested the use of Bayesian probability to estimate the probability of God&#x27;s existence.

==Mathematical arguments for belief==
A common application of decision theory to the belief in God is Pascal&#x27;s wager, published by Blaise Pascal in his 1669 work &quot;Pensées&quot;. The application is a defense of Christianity stating that &quot;If God does not exist, the Atheist loses little by believing in him and gains little by not believing. If God does exist, the Atheist gains eternal life by believing and loses an infinite good by not believing&quot;. The atheist&#x27;s wager has been proposed as a counterargument to Pascal&#x27;s Wager.

<doc id="335705" wikidata="Q49758" url="?curid=335705" title="National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)">
<text>The National-Democratic Party of Germany (, ) was an East German political party that served as a satellite party to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) from 1948 to 1989, representing former members of the Nazi Party, the Wehrmacht and middle classes. It should not be confused with the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (&quot;Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands&quot;, NPD), which was a party in West Germany and continues as a minor non-governmental party in the modern united Germany.

==History==
The NDPD was co-founded by Lothar Bolz (a former member of the Communist Party of Germany and the National Committee for a Free Germany in the Soviet Union), Wilhelm Adam (a former member of the SA) and others. It was intended to reach out to social groups that had been attracted by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) before 1945 (such as military men or middle class &quot;Petite bourgeoisie&quot;) and provide them with a political outlet, so that they would not be tempted by far-right politics again or turn to the anti-communist Western Allies. German nationalism had been a potent force during the interwar era, millions of Germans had been members of the NSDAP, and Stalin wanted to use them to create a new pro-Soviet and anti-Western strain in German politics. According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin even suggested that they could be allowed to continue publishing their own newspaper, &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;. German Communists and some Soviet officials were initially appalled by Stalin&#x27;s ideas and were not enthusiastic in their implementation. Instead, the party launched a regional daily, &quot;Mitteldeutsche Neueste Nachrichten&quot;, in 1952.
In addition to old NSDAP members, former Wehrmacht officers and displaced persons were also to be intercepted by the new party, like the West German All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights and the Austrian Federation of Independents. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) Board, meeting in May 1948, stated that &quot;these politically unclear people&quot; should not vote &quot;cadets&quot; for the bourgeois parties CDU and LDPD at the next election, like the West German CDU and FDP.

According to Klaus Schroeder, the NDPD had fewer former Nazis among its ranks than the communist SED had. This was due to the NDPD being much smaller than the SED.

The NDPD was recognized by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany on 16 August 1948 and later sent 52 delegates to the East German parliament, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, as part of the National Front. None of these ever voted against the government on any issue, similarly to other block parties which were effectively puppets of the ruling party, the SED. 

Nonetheless, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the NDPD became an independent agent in politics, participating in the only free &quot;Volkskammer&quot; election ever held (on 18 March 1990). NDPD was not included in the electoral cartel of the other liberal-to-be parties in East Germany and entered the race alone. The results were a debacle: with 44,292 votes (0.38%) they received fewer votes than they (nominally) had members. On 27 March 1990 the NDPD became part of the &quot;Bund Freier Demokraten&quot;, a short-lived organization that eventually merged into the Free Democratic Party (FDP).

== Programme and ideology ==
The NDPD programme demanded, among other things, the promotion of the middle class. Bolz was one of the few prominent members who was not a former Nazi and was, in fact, a member of the SED until he founded the new party. He had previously been a member of the Communist Party of Germany until it was suppressed by the Nazis. The NDPD was established by the communist authorities with the aim of claiming support among these ranks of society. The NDPD was organised on democratic centralist grounds and had 110,000 members in the late 1980s.

The party was supposed to represent liberalism, like the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, and (at least initially) also played with the German national sentiment. However, the NDPD was even more loyal to the SED and was reluctant to criticise the government even during the Peaceful Revolution of 1989.

After the revolution, there were attempts by the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) and the right-wing populist The Republicans to win the NDPD as an ally, but this failed.

Later, the NDPD understood itself as a centrist party and distanced itself from communist and nationalist/neo-fascist endeavors. Likewise, they were pro-European and rejected designation as &quot;right-wing party&quot;, right-wing national or national conservative. It was also argued to rename the party &quot;New Democratic Party of Germany&quot;.

<text>Omnibenevolence is defined by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as &quot;unlimited or infinite &quot;. Some philosophers, such as Epicurus, have argued that it is impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such a property alongside omniscience and omnipotence, as a result of the problem of evil. However, some philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga, argue the plausibility of co-existence.

The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the philosophy of religion, mainly in context of the problem of evil and theodical responses to such, although even in said contexts the phrases &quot;perfect goodness&quot; and &quot;moral perfection&quot; are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes &quot;infinite benevolence&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;omnibenevolence&quot; derives from the Latin prefix &quot;omni&quot;-, meaning &quot;all&quot;, and the words &quot;bene&quot; and &quot;volens&quot;, meaning &quot;good&quot; and &quot;will&quot;, respectively. Thus the term means &quot;all good will&quot;.

==Usage==
The term is patterned on, and often accompanied by, the terms &quot;omniscience&quot; and &quot;omnipotence&quot;, typically to refer to conceptions of an &quot;all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful&quot; deity. Philosophers and theologians more commonly use phrases like &quot;perfectly good&quot;, or simply the term &quot;&quot;. The word &quot;omnibenevolence&quot; may be interpreted to mean perfectly just, all-loving, fully merciful, or any number of other qualities, depending on precisely how &quot;good&quot; is understood. As such, there is little agreement over how an &quot;omnibenevolent&quot; being would behave.

The earliest record for its use in English, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, is in 1679. The Catholic Church does not appear to use the term &quot;omnibenevolent&quot; in the liturgy or Catechism. Saint Thomas Aquinas in particular explained in &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; that God may indirectly want evil in the physical world, when this is necessary for the greater good of the order of the universe.

Modern users of the term include George H. Smith in his book &quot;&quot; (1980), where he argued that divine qualities are inconsistent. However, the term is also used by authors who defend the coherence of divine attributes, including but not limited to, Jonathan Kvanvig in &quot;The Problem of Hell&quot; (1993), and Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz in &quot;The Divine Attributes&quot; (2002).

The terminology has been used by some prominent Roman Catholic figures, examples being Bishop Robert Barron, Doctor of Sacred Theology in his 2011 book &quot;Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith&quot;.

==Philosophical perspectives==
The notion of an omnibenevolent, infinitely compassionate deity has raised certain atheistic objections, such as the problem of evil and the problem of Hell. Responses to such problems are called theodicies and can be general, arguing for the coherence of the divine, such as Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Providence and the Problem of Evil&quot;, or they can address a specific problem, such as Charles Seymour&#x27;s &quot;A Theodicy of Hell&quot;.

Proponents of pandeism contend that benevolence (much less omnibenevolence) is simply not required to account for any property of our Universe, as a morally neutral deity which was powerful enough to have created our Universe as we experience it would be, by definition, able to have created our Universe as we experience it. William C. Lane contended that pandeism thereby offered an escape from the evidential argument from evil: In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that:

==Religious perspectives==
The theological justification stems from God&#x27;s aseity: the non-contingent, independent and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For if he was not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence. Hence, omnibenevolence is a requisite of perfect being theology.

Theologians in the Wesleyan tradition (see Thomas Jay Oord) argue that omnibenevolence is God&#x27;s primary attribute. Some Hyper-Calvinist interpretations reject omnibenevolence. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church is infamous for its expression of this stance.

Christian apologist William Lane Craig argues that Islam does not hold to the idea of omnibenevolence.

==In the Holy Bible==
 lists &quot;kindness&quot; among the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit God. So far, it is believed to be an attribute of God.

<text>The Ludus de Antichristo (Play About the Antichrist) is a liturgical-oriented drama from the 12th century whose original author is unknown. Its origins are almost certainly from southern Germany, likely a product of the Benedictine monastery in Tegernsee, Bavaria—as the manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery. Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa I and his troubles with Pope Alexander III. A roughly seventy-line fragment of the play is also extant in a thirteenth-century Gospel text from the St. Georgenberg Abbey in modern-day Fiecht, Austria—suggesting a link between the two monastic communities. Overall, the play is a critique of reform efforts instituted by the Papacy in the twelfth century that would potentially weaken monastic self-rule in favor of a more centralized Papal control over Christian instruction and education, specifically centered on the growth of cathedral schools. The monastery at Tegernsee had enjoyed suzerainty from Papal oversight since the tenth century—answering directly to the Holy Roman Emperor—and sought employ a propaganda effort amongst the many Benedictine communities in Bavaria and Austria in the form of a dramatic interpretation of eschatological events that were supportive of the Emperor as God&#x27;s instrument in bringing about the final events Christian narrative, rather than those efforts of the Papacy. The long-standing designation of the play as a &quot;liturgical&quot; (dating back to the nineteenth century) is a result of the inclusion of several well-known liturgies popular amongst Benedictine monastic communities. But these liturgies reflect an &quot;insider&#x27;s knowledge&quot; of their traditional means of performance, altering the reception of changes made by the author of the play so that the propagandistic messages are codified specifically for the monastic communities that surround Tegernsee. The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the Antichrist, a prophesied figure of evil whose coming (according to the Old and New Testaments) was an indication that the end of the world, or apocalypse, was near.

<text>Leon Štukelj (; 12 November 1898 – 8 November 1999) was a Slovene professional gymnast. He was an Olympic gold medalist and athlete who represented Yugoslavia at the Olympics.

He is a noted figure in Slovenian sporting history. Štukelj is one of the first Slovene athletes to have risen to the very top of his sport, where he remained right from the World Championships in Ljubljana in 1922 all the way to the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, at which point he finished his competitive gymnastics career.

Štukelj competed at seven major international competitions and won a total of twenty medals: eight gold, six silver, and six bronze. At the Olympic Games alone he won six medals: two gold medals (counted for Yugoslavia) in Paris in 1924, one gold medal and two bronze in Amsterdam in 1928, and a silver medal in Berlin in 1936.

==Biography==
Štukelj was born in Kandija (part of Novo Mesto since 1923), Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). His baptismal record bears the name &quot;Leopold&quot;, crossed out and replaced with &quot;Leo&quot;. A 1999 addendum to the volume corrects the name &quot;Leo&quot; to &quot;Leon&quot;; his name appears as both &quot;Leo Štukelj&quot; and &quot;Leon Štukelj&quot; in newspapers of the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1927, Štukelj graduated with a degree in law. Since his youth, he was an active member of the Slovenian &quot;Sokol&quot; athletic movement. After finishing his sports career, he became a judge, first in his hometown of Novo Mesto. Later, he moved to Lenart, and then to Maribor, where he lived until his death. After World War II, Štukelj was not a supporter of the newly formed Communist regime of Yugoslavia. He took part in the Yugoslav royalist (Chetnik) movement, hostile to Tito&#x27;s partisans, and maintained contacts with the British Special Operations Executive. For these reasons, he was suspicious to the new Communist regime. After the war, he was first imprisoned, then released; but permanently barred from being a judge. He worked as a legal assistant for the rest of his career.

Štukelj was presented at the opening ceremony of the Games of the XXVI Olympiad in Atlanta in 1996 as the oldest living Olympic gold medalist at the time, where he shook hands with the current President of the United States at the time, Bill Clinton. He also presented the medals to winners in the men&#x27;s team competition.

His one-hundredth birthday in 1998 was a major celebration in Slovenia. Štukelj still exercised regularly until even just before his death, only four days short of his one-hundred and first birthday. 

Today a sports hall in Novo Mesto, mainly used by a local basketball team, is named after him, in addition to the University Sports Hall situated on the campus of the University of Maribor.

<text>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles (, ) is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or archdiocese of the Catholic Church located in the southern coastal portion of the U.S. state of California. The archdiocese&#x27;s cathedra is in Los Angeles, and the archdiocese comprises the California counties of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura. The cathedral is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and its present archbishop is José Horacio Gómez Velasco. With over five million professing members and weekly liturgies celebrated in 32 languages, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is numerically the single largest and most ethnically diverse archdiocese in the United States.

The Archbishop of Los Angeles also serves as metropolitan bishop of the suffragan dioceses within the Ecclesiastical Province of Los Angeles, which includes the dioceses of Fresno, Monterey, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego.

Following the establishment of the Spanish missions in California, the diocese of the Two Californias was established on 1840, when the Los Angeles region was still part of Mexico. In 1848, Mexican California was ceded to the United States, and the U.S. portion of the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey. The diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles in 1859, and the episcopal see was moved to Los Angeles upon the completion of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in 1876. Los Angeles split from Monterey to become the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego in 1922. The diocese was split again in 1936 to create the Diocese of San Diego, and the Los Angeles was seen elevated to an archdiocese. The archdiocese&#x27;s present territory was established in 1976, when Orange County was split off to establish the Diocese of Orange.

The sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles resulted in a $880 million court settlement, a record-breaking amount, in 2024; bringing the total settlement payouts for the Archdiocese to over $1.5 billion. Instances of sexual abuse within the archdiocese are documented starting in the 1930s, though instances from the 1970s through 1990s have been more highly publicized.

==History==
With the papal bull &quot;Apostolicam sollicitudinem&quot; of 27 April 1840, Pope Gregory XVI set up a new episcopal see, to which he gave the name of Diocese of California (also interchangeably called &quot;Diocese of Two Californias&quot; or &quot;Diocese of Both Californias&quot;). He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the Diocese of Sonora, now the Archdiocese of Hermosillo in Mexico. It included Alta California, encompassing the present states of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming, and the Baja California Territory, encompassing the modern Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. He set the episcopal residence at San Diego and made the diocese a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mexico City. Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno, OFM became the first bishop of the new diocese, with Mission Santa Barbara serving as its pro-cathedral.

After ceding Alta California to the United States at the close of the Mexican–American War, the government of Mexico objected to a bishop based in the United States having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The Holy See divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections. On 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese.

In 1853, Pope Pius IX erected the Metropolitan Archdiocese of San Francisco, taking the territory that now constitutes Nevada, Utah, and much of northern California from the diocese and making the diocese a suffragan thereof.

In 1859, the same pope renamed the diocese to Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles to recognize the growth of the city of Los Angeles. The bishop moved his principal residence to Los Angeles and used the Mission of Santa Barbara as a pro-cathedral until the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana opened in 1876.

On June 1, 1922, Pope Pius XI renamed the diocese again, making it the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, and simultaneously erected a new diocese, named the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno, in what had become northern portion of its territory after the erection of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. This changed the title of Bishop John Joseph Cantwell from Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles to bishop Los Angeles-San Diego, which then comprised the counties of Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.

On July 11, 1936, the same pope elevated and renamed the diocese as the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Los Angeles, with John Joseph Cantwell becoming the first archbishop of Los Angeles, concurrently erecting the Diocese of San Diego with the territory of Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, and designated the new Diocese of San Diego and the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno as suffragan of the new metropolitan see.

Pope Paul VI subsequently split each of the three dioceses of the Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles into two.
* On October 6, 1967, he suppressed the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno and erected the present Diocese of Fresno and the present Diocese of Monterey in California, splitting in the territory of the suppressed diocese between them making both new dioceses also suffragans of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The inclusion of &quot;in California&quot; in the title of the latter of the new dioceses differentiates it from other dioceses with see cities that have the same name.
* On March 24, 1976, he erected Diocese of Orange, taking Orange County from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and making the new diocese a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Los Angeles. This action also established the present territory of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, consisting of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties.
* On July 14, 1978, he erected the Diocese of San Bernardino, taking San Bernardino and Riverside Counties from the Diocese of San Diego and making the new diocese also a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

These actions established the present configuration of the Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles.

===Pastoral regions===
In 1986, Roger Mahony designated five geographical administrative pastoral regions, each led by an auxiliary bishop who functions as the region&#x27;s episcopal vicar. The five regions are:
* Our Lady of the Angels, covering downtown and central Los Angeles west to Malibu, south to Los Angeles International Airport. The region has the cathedral, 78 parishes, 10 Catholic high schools, 5 Catholic hospitals, 1 cemetery, 3 parochial missions, 1 seminary, and no Spanish missions. Appointed in Sept 2023, The episcopal vicar is Bishop Matthew G. Elshoff, OFM Cap.
* San Fernando, covering the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys and northeast Los Angeles. The region has 54 parishes, 12 Catholic high schools, 2 Catholic hospitals, 2 cemeteries, 7 parochial missions, 1 active duty military chapel installation, and 1 Spanish mission. As of 2023, Bishop Albert M. Bahhuth is the Episcopal Vicar. 
* San Gabriel, covering East Los Angeles through the San Gabriel Valley and the Pomona Valley. The region has 66 parishes, 13 Catholic high schools, 3 Catholic hospitals, 4 cemeteries, 2 parochial missions and 1 Spanish mission. As of 2023, Bishop Brian A. Nunes serves as the Episcopal Vicar. 
* San Pedro, covering Long Beach and southern Los Angeles County. The region has 67 parishes, 9 Catholic high schools, 6 Catholic hospitals, 1 cemetery, 1 active duty military chapel installation, and 1 parochial mission. Gómez appointed Marc V. Trudeau as episcopal vicar for this region in 2018.
* Santa Barbara, covering Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. The region has 37 parishes, 6 Catholic high schools, 3 Catholic hospitals, 4 cemeteries, 3 active duty military chapel installations, 6 parochial missions and 4 Spanish missions. As of 2023, the Episcopal Vicar is Bishop Sławomir Szkredka.

===Clergy sexual abuse ===
There were many cases of sexual abuse by priests in the diocese, first reported as dating from the 1930s. Cases were ignored or dealt with secretly until the 21st century, when priests were dismissed and a report and apology produced.

On July 16, 2007, Cardinal Roger Mahony and the archdiocese reached a record-breaking settlement with 508 alleged victims of sexual abuse by priests. The settlement was worth $660 million, with an average of $1.3 million for each plaintiff. Mahony described the abuse as a &quot;terrible sin and crime&quot;, after a series of trials into sex abuse claims since the 1940s were to begin. The agreement settled all outstanding civil lawsuits against the archdiocese and dwarfs the $157 million settlement paid by the Archdiocese of Boston since Massachusetts law places a legal dollar cap on how much money a non-profit group can be required to pay.

In 2014 the diocese agreed to pay $13 million to settle a final group of 17 sex abuse lawsuits, including eleven that involved &quot;a visiting Mexican priest who fled prosecution and remains a fugitive more than 25 years later&quot;. The settlement followed a court order forcing the Archdiocese to release files which showed that it had shielded accused priests, for example by ordering church officials not to turn over a list of altar boys to police who were investigating.

From May to December 2019, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles provided numerous documents to California State Attorney Xavier Becerra in preparation for a series of pending lawsuits which are expected to be filed after a new California law which will temporarily remove the statute of limitations. The new law went into effect on January 1, 2020. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is one of six Catholic dioceses throughout the state of California which is expected to be subpoenaed during the upcoming lawsuits. In January 2020, it was reported that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles settled a sexual abuse case against a former Archdiocese priest for $1.9 million.

==Archbishop==

The archdiocese is led by the archbishop, who governs from the mother church, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The cathedral was dedicated on September 2, 2002, and replaced the former Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

The Archbishop of Los Angeles is the metropolitan of the Province of Los Angeles of the Catholic Church. Its suffragans are the dioceses of Fresno, Monterey in California, Orange in California, San Bernardino, and San Diego. Metropolitan archbishops historically wielded great administrative powers over the suffragan dioceses. Today, such power is only ceremonial and kept as a tradition.

José H. Gómez is the current archbishop of Los Angeles, having automatically succeeded his predecessor, Cardinal Roger Mahony, who served for 25 years, upon the latter&#x27;s retirement which took effect on March 1, 2011. Previously, Gómez served as Coadjutor Archbishop of Los Angeles since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on April 6, 2010. He previously served as Archbishop of San Antonio from 2004 to 2010, and as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Denver from 2001 to 2004. He is an ordained priest of Opus Dei.

Gómez is assisted by the current auxiliary bishops: Marc Vincent Trudeau and Alejandro D. Aclan. In addition, Edward W. Clark, Joseph Martin Sartoris and Gerald Eugene Wilkerson are retired auxiliary bishops still living and residing within the archdiocese.

The archdiocese has entrusted the annual celebration of the Votive Mass in honor of Our Lady of the Angels to the Queen of Angels Foundation, a lay association of the Catholic Church founded by Mark Anchor Albert, dedicated to promoting devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Each year since 2011, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels has hosted a Votive Mass in honor of Our Lady, Queen of Angels. The Mass follows a Marian procession which originates from the historic Queen of Angels parish, which is part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, and culminates at the cathedral.

Since 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation has sponsored the annual Marian processions, Votive Masses, and fiestas in commemoration of Los Angeles&#x27; birthday and the feast of Our Lady of the Angels.

The Metropolitan Province of Los Angeles, which includes the L.A. Archdiocese, further modified the list, and , celebrates four holy days of obligation on the days prescribed by canon law. The solemnity of the Ascension is transferred from Thursday of the sixth week of Easter to the seventh Sunday of Easter. The province has abrogated the obligation to attend Mass on the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.

<text>Carl Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann (12 April 1852 – 6 March 1939) was a German mathematician, noted for his proof, published in 1882, that  (pi) is a transcendental number, meaning it is not a root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.

== Life and education ==
Lindemann was born in Hanover, the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover. His father, Ferdinand Lindemann, taught modern languages at a Gymnasium in Hanover. His mother, Emilie Crusius, was the daughter of the Gymnasium&#x27;s headmaster. The family later moved to Schwerin, where young Ferdinand attended school.

He studied mathematics at Göttingen, Erlangen, and Munich. At Erlangen he received a doctorate, supervised by Felix Klein, on non-Euclidean geometry. Lindemann subsequently taught in Würzburg and at the University of Freiburg. During his time in Freiburg, Lindemann devised his proof that is a transcendental number (see Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem). After his time in Freiburg, Lindemann transferred to the University of Königsberg. While a professor in Königsberg, Lindemann acted as supervisor for the doctoral theses of the mathematicians David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, and Arnold Sommerfeld.

== Transcendence proof ==
In 1882, Lindemann published the result for which he is best known, the transcendence of . His methods were similar to those used nine years earlier by Charles Hermite to show that &quot;e&quot;, the base of natural logarithms, is transcendental. Before the publication of Lindemann&#x27;s proof, it was known that was irrational, as Johann Heinrich Lambert proved was irrational in the 1760s.

<doc id="335737" wikidata="Q2378910" url="?curid=335737" title="Megacles">
<text>Megacles or Megakles () was the name of several notable men of ancient Athens, as well as an officer of Pyrrhus of Epirus.

== First archon ==
The first Megacles was possibly a legendary archon of Athens from 922 BC to 892 BC.

==Archon eponymous==
The second Megacles was a member of the Alcmaeonidae family, and the archon eponymous in 632 BC when Cylon made his unsuccessful attempt to take over Athens. Megacles was convicted of killing Cylon&#x27;s supporters (who had taken refuge on the Acropolis as suppliants of Athena) and was exiled from the city, along with all the other members of his genos, the Alcmaeonidae. The Alcmaeonidae inherited a &quot;miasma&quot; (&quot;stain&quot;) that lasted for generations among Megacles&#x27; descendants.

== Alcmaeonidae ==
The third Megacles, the grandson of the above eponymous archon, son of Alcmaeon and member of the Alcmaeonidae family, was an opponent of Pisistratus in the 6th century BC. He drove out Pisistratus during the latter&#x27;s first reign as tyrant in 560 BC, but the two then made an alliance with each other, and Pisistratus married Megacles&#x27; daughter. Herodotus says that they also tricked the Athenians into believing Athena herself had arrived to proclaim Pisistratus tyrant, by dressing up a woman named Phye as the goddess, although Herodotus himself casts doubt on the truth of this story. However, Megacles turned against Pisistratus when Pisistratus refused to have children with Megacles&#x27; daughter, which brought an end to the second tyranny.

This Megacles earlier had competed with Hippocleides, a future archon of Athens, to marry Agarista, the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons. The elder was Hippocrates, whose children were another Megacles (ostracized 486 BC) and a daughter Agariste, the mother of Pericles and Ariphron (himself the father of Hippocrates of Athens who died 424 BC). The younger son was Cleisthenes, who was allegedly the grandfather of Deinomache (or Dinomache), mother of Alcibiades (d. 404 BC). Thus, Megacles the elder was great-grandfather of Pericles and the great-great-grandfather of Alcibiades.

==Battle of Marathon==
The fourth Megacles, grandson of the above, son of Hippocrates, and nephew of Cleisthenes is sometimes described as the father of Deinomache and thus the maternal grandfather of Alcibiades. Other sources, notably William Smith, insist that his uncle Cleisthenes was the grandfather of Alcibiades.

In 490 BC, in the aftermath of the Battle of Marathon, a shield-signal was raised on Mount Pentelicon above Marathon supposedly to signal the Persians to sail around Cape Sounion and attack the unguarded city of Athens. Herodotus reports that the Alcmaeonidae were widely believed to have been behind this act of treachery. With Megacles being the leading figure of the Alcmaeonid clan at the time, a lingering suspicion of medism hung over him.

In 486 BC, Megacles was ostracised. Numerous ostraca have been found with comments on them making reference to his ostentatious wealth and love of luxury.

He was honored by Pindar as exiled winner in the chariot race of Pythian Games 486 BC.

== Megacles of Epirus ==

Megacles of Epirus was an officer in the service of Pyrrhus of Epirus, who accompanied that monarch on his expedition to Italy, 280 BC. He is mentioned as accompanying Pyrrhus when he reconnoitered the Roman camp previous to the battle of Heraclea; and in that action was the means of saving the king&#x27;s life, by exchanging armour with him, and thus directing the efforts of the assailants upon himself, instead of Pyrrhus. He fell a victim to his devotion, being slain by a Roman named Publius Decius Mus.
