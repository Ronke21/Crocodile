<text>A diving suit is a garment or device designed to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A diving suit may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (such as for a standard diving dress or atmospheric diving suit), but in most cases the term applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.

Diving suits can be divided into two classes: &quot;soft&quot; or ambient pressure diving suits – examples are wetsuits, dry suits, semi-dry suits and dive skins – and &quot;hard&quot; or atmospheric pressure diving suits, armored suits that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the suit. Hot water suits are actively heated wetsuits.

== Function ==
The diving suit is worn as protection from the diving environment. This has several aspects, the importance of which may vary depending on the specific environment of the dive.
Atmospheric diving suits primarily isolate the diver from the ambient pressure, and all the complications it brings as consequences of breathing gas under pressure.
Ambient pressure suits – dive skins, wetsuits and dry suits – have no pressure isolation effect, and are usually primarily worn for thermal protection, and thermal protection can also influence decompression.
A common secondary purpose of dive skins, wetsuits and dry suits is protection from abrasion, stings from sea animals and minor cuts and impact injury.
In some environments containing hazardous materials or microorganisms, the dry suit has the primary function of isolating the diver from the hazardous materials or microorganisms. This type of suit relies on full watertight coverage for effective protection. These additional functions are inherently available from the atmospheric diving suit.

== History ==
Charles C.-J. Le Roux created a waterproof and windproof fabric which could be made into early diving suits. The first diving suit designs appeared in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-resisting diving suits in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. This suit gave the diver enough maneuverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.
After testing this machine in his garden pond (specially built for the purpose) Lethbridge dived on a number of wrecks: four English men-of-war, one East Indiaman, two Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy as a result of his salvages. One of his better-known recoveries was on the Dutch &quot;Slot ter Hooge&quot;, which had sunk off Madeira with over three tons of silver on board.

At the same time, Andrew Becker created a leather-covered diving suit with a helmet featuring a window. Becker used a system of tubes for inhaling and exhaling, and demonstrated his suit in the River Thames, London, during which he remained submerged for an hour.
German-born British engineer Augustus Siebe developed the standard diving dress in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements on the Deane brothers&#x27; helmet already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design: a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. Later suits were made from waterproofed canvas invented by Charles Macintosh. From the late 1800s and throughout most of the 20th century, most standard dress was made from a thin sheet of solid rubber laminated between layers of tan twill.

The oldest preserved suit, named &quot;Wanha herra&quot; (meaning &quot;Old gentleman&quot; in the old Finnish language) can be found in Raahe Museum, Finland. It was made of calf leather and dates from the 18th century. Its exact origin is unknown but the foot parts suggest a Finnish origin. The suit, which was used in short underwater work like checking the condition of the bottom of a ship, was donated to Raahe Museum by Captain Johan Leufstadius (1829-1906), who was a master mariner, merchant and ship owner. The conservator of Raahe Museum, Jouko Turunen, tailored an accurate copy of the old suit in 1988, which has been successfully tested underwater several times.

The Sladen suit was a type of heavy dry suit made by Siebe Gorman which was used with rebreathers by British navy divers during the Second World War. Lighter dry suits made of latex rubber by Pirelli were used in World War II by Italian frogmen. They were patented in 1951.

==Ambient pressure suits==
Ambient pressure suits are a form of exposure protection protecting the wearer from the cold and in the case of dry suits, from contact with the surrounding water. They also provide some defense from abrasive and sharp objects as well as some forms of potentially harmful underwater life. They do not protect divers from the pressure of the surrounding water or barotrauma and decompression sickness.

There are five main types of ambient pressure diving suits; dive skins, wetsuits and their derivative semi-dry suit and hot-water suits, and dry suits. Apart from hot water suits, these types of suit are not exclusively used by divers but are often used for thermal protection by people engaged in other water sports activities such as surfing, sailing, powerboating, windsurfing, kite surfing, waterskiing, caving and swimming.

Added buoyancy due to the volume of the suit is a side effect of most diving suits. A diving weighting system can be worn to counteract this buoyancy. Overalls may be worn over the diving suit as additional protection against cuts and abrasion. This is more usual for professional divers. Overalls increase drag while swimming and are not popular for recreational scuba.

===Dive skins===
&quot;Dive skins&quot; are used when diving in water temperatures above . They are made from spandex or Lycra and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from jellyfish stings, abrasion and sunburn. This kind of suit is also known as a &#x27;Stinger Suit&#x27;. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.

The &quot;Dive Skin&quot; was originally invented to protect scuba divers in Queensland Australia against the &quot;Box jellyfish&quot; (&quot;Chironex fleckeri&quot;)

In 1978, Tony Farmer was a swimsuit designer and manufacturer who owned a business called &quot;Daring Designs&quot;. Besides swimwear he also did underwear and aerobic wear which included a full suit in Lycra/Spandex. He became a scuba diver and that was the catalyst to the invention of the &quot;dive skin&quot; as we know it today.

===Wetsuits===

Wetsuits are relatively inexpensive, simple, expanded neoprene suits that are typically used where the water temperature is between . The foamed neoprene of the suit thermally insulates the wearer. Although water can enter the suit, a close fitting suit prevents excessive heat loss because little of the water warmed inside the suit escapes from the suit to be replaced by cold water, a process referred to as &quot;flushing&quot;.

Proper fit is critical for warmth. A suit that is too loose will allow a large amount of water to circulate over the diver&#x27;s skin, taking up body heat. A suit that is too tight is very uncomfortable and can impair circulation at the neck, a very dangerous condition which can cause blackouts. For this reason, many divers choose to have wetsuits custom-tailored instead of buying them &quot;off the rack&quot;. Many companies offer this service and the cost is often comparable to an off-the-rack suit.

Wetsuits are limited in their ability to preserve warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10 mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7 mm, 5 mm, 3 mm, and 1 mm. A 1 mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.

====Semi-dry suits====
Semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with watertight seams and nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck, ankles and zip. They are typically used where the water temperature is between . The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit&#x27;s insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are usually made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals having a slick sealing surface in contact with the skin. Two-piece sets tend to be a one piece full length suit, sometimes described as &quot;long johns&quot;, plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.

====Hot water suits====

Hot water suits are loose fitting neoprene wetsuits used in cold water commercial surface-supplied diving. A hose in the diver&#x27;s umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater at the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary the warmth of the suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn to extend heating to the extremities. Breathing gas heating at the helmet is available by using a hot water shroud over the helmet inlet piping between the valve block and the regulator. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design, and need not be very thick, as their primary function is to temporarily retain and guide the flow of the heating water. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.

Hot water suits are often used for deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much more efficiently than air, but has a lower molar heat capacity. The heat capacity by volume is increased proportionally to the pressure which means that the diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it at great depths. This compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Loss of heated water supply for hot water suits can be a life-threatening emergency with a high risk of debilitating hypothermia. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes. Depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.

Heated water in the suit forms an active insulation barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32 °C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45 °C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, and in the early stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large transient volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.

The diver will usually wear something under a hot water suit for protection against scalding and chafe, and for personal hygiene, as hot water suits may be shared by divers on different shifts, and the interior of the suit may transmit fungal infections if not sufficiently cleaned between users. Wetsuits are effective against scalding of the covered parts of the body, and thermal underwear can protect against chafe, and keep the standby diver warm at the surface.

Hot water is supplied from a heating system at the surface, commonly heated by burning diesel fuel, though electrical versions are also available, and the water is delivered to the umbilical by a pump. Heaters may be rated from 1 to 3 divers. Large hot water systems are available in containerised packages.

The hot water supply hose of the umbilical is commonly bore, and is connected to a supply manifold at the right hip of the suit, which has a set of valves to allow the diver to control flow to the front and back of the torso, and to the arms and legs, and to dump the supply to the environment if the water is too hot or too cold. The manifold distributes the water through the suit through perforated tubes. The hot-water suit is normally a one-piece neoprene wetsuit, fairly loose fitting, to fit over a thin neoprene undersuit, which can protect the diver from scalding if the temperature control system fails, with a zipper on the front of the torso and on the lower part of each leg. Gloves and boots are worn which receive hot water from the ends of the arm and leg hoses. If a full-face mask is worn, the hood may be supplied by a tube at the neck of the suit. Helmets do not require heating. The heating water flows out at the neck and cuffs of the suit through the overlap with gloves, boots, or hood.

====Risks associated with hot water suits====
*Increased risk of decompression sickness due to accelerated ingassing during the deep part of the dive, exacerbated if the heating is reduced during decompression.
*Increased risk of hypothermia if the skin is warm enough not to feel chilled, but heat balance is negative, as peripheral vasoconstriction to conserve heat does not occur. Major heat loss to breathing gas can occur.

===Dry suits===


Dry suits are generally used where the water temperature is between . Water is prevented from entering the suit by seals at the neck and wrists and the opening for getting the suit on and off is typically closed by a waterproof zipper. The suit insulates the wearer by maintaining an insulating layer of air in the undersuit between the body and the suit shell, (in exactly the way that thermal insulation garments work above water) or by using a watertight expanded neoprene suit shell, which is inherently insulating in the same way as a wet suit, and which can usually be worn with additional insulating undergarments.

Both laminated fabric and neoprene drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, they are quite bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. The woven materials are relatively inelastic and constrain joint mobility unless inflated to a fairly loose fit. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits and are more elastic, but in some cases do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a significant degree of insulation.

Special dry suits made of strong externally rubberised fabric are worn by commercial divers who work in contaminated environments such as sewage or hazardous chemicals. the smooth outer surface is easier to decontaminate. The hazmat dry suit has integral boots and is sealed to a diving helmet and dry gloves to prevent any contact with the hazardous material.

Constant volume dry suits have a system allowing the suit to be inflated to prevent &quot;suit squeeze&quot; caused by increasing pressure and to prevent excessive compression of the insulating undergarments. They also have vents allowing the excess air to escape from the suit during ascent.

For additional warmth, some dry suit users inflate their suits with argon, an inert gas which has superior thermal insulating properties compared to air. The argon is carried in a small cylinder, separate from the diver&#x27;s breathing gas. This arrangement is frequently used when the breathing gas contains helium, which is a very poor insulator in comparison with other breathing gases.

===Tubesuits===

A tubesuit is a type of heating or cooling garment which is intended to be worn under the diving suit. It circulates heated or chilled water through closed circuit flexible tubes close to the wearers skin. It would normally be worn under a further layer of insulation to reduce heat transfer with the external environment. The circulating water can be supplied from a battery powered heat pump unit carried by the diver, making this type of thermal management suitable for scuba divers. A tubesuit can be worn under an environmentally sealed dry suit, suitable for use in contaminated water

===Diving suit combinations===
A &quot;shortie&quot; wetsuit or tunic may be worn over a full wetsuit for added insulation. Some vendors sell a very similar item and refer to it as a &#x27;core warmer&#x27; when worn over another wetsuit. A &quot;skin&quot; may also be worn under a wetsuit. This practice started with divers wearing body tights under a wetsuit for extra warmth and to make donning and removing the wetsuit easier. A &quot;skin&quot; may also be worn as an undersuit beneath a drysuit in temperatures where a full undersuit is not necessary.

===Accessories===
* Gloves are often worn when diving, as thermal protection, as protection against the environment and work hazards, or both. Both dry and wet gloves are available. Dry gloves may be permanently bonded to the sleeves of a dry suit, or connected by a cuff-ring system.
* Foot protection is usually worn when diving, either under fins or as protection for the feet when diving heavy, where the diver moves around mainly by walking, in which case the boots may be weighted for better stability when standing. Boots are integral part of most dry suits, unless they are terminated by integral socks. Non-watertight boots may be worn over integral boots or neoprene socks for protection against the workplace hazards when the diver wears a wetsuit or hot-water suit.
* Hoods are generally worn for thermal protection if the diver does not use a helmet. Dry hoods are available, but relatively uncommon, and the usual arrangement is a neoprene hood which is a separate unit or part of the wetsuit.

==Atmospheric diving suits==
An atmospheric diving suit is a small one-man articulated submersible of anthropomorphic form which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere.

These can be used for very deep dives for long periods without the need for decompression, and eliminate the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving. Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers. Mobility and dexterity are usually restricted by mechanical constraints, and the ergonomics of movement are problematic.

<doc id="326540" wikidata="Q5385318" url="?curid=326540" title="Erdős cardinal">
<text>In mathematics, an Erdős cardinal, also called a partition cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number introduced by .

A cardinal formula_1 is called formula_2-Erdős if for every function formula_3, there is a set of order type formula_2 that is homogeneous for formula_5. In the notation of the partition calculus, formula_1 is formula_2-Erdős if

:formula_8.

Under this definition, any cardinal larger than the least formula_2-Erdős cardinal is formula_2-Erdős.

The existence of zero sharp implies that the constructible universe formula_11 satisfies &quot;for every countable ordinal formula_2, there is an formula_2-Erdős cardinal&quot;. In fact, for every indiscernible formula_1, formula_15 satisfies &quot;for every ordinal formula_2, there is an formula_2-Erdős cardinal in formula_18&quot; (the Lévy collapse to make formula_2 countable).

However, the existence of an formula_20-Erdős cardinal implies existence of zero sharp. If formula_5 is the satisfaction relation for formula_11 (using ordinal parameters), then the existence of zero sharp is equivalent to there being an formula_20-Erdős ordinal with respect to formula_5. Thus, the existence of an formula_20-Erdős cardinal implies that the axiom of constructibility is false.

The least formula_26-Erdős cardinal is not weakly compact,p. 39. nor is the least formula_20-Erdős cardinal.p. 39

If formula_1 is formula_2-Erdős, then it is formula_2-Erdős in every transitive model satisfying &quot;formula_2 is countable.&quot;

==Dodd&#x27;s Notion of Erdős Cardinals==

For a limit ordinal formula_2, a cardinal formula_1 is less often called formula_2-Erdős if for every closed unbounded formula_35 and every function formula_36 such that formula_37 for all formula_38, there is a set formula_39 of order-type formula_2 that is homogeneous for formula_5.p. 138.

An equivalent definition is that formula_1 is formula_2-Erdős if for any formula_44, there is a set formula_45 of order-type formula_2 of order-indiscernibles for the structure formula_47 such that:

* for every formula_48, formula_49, and
* for every formula_50, the set formula_51 forms a set of order-indiscernibles for the structure formula_52.

The least cardinal formula_1 to satisfy the partition relation formula_8 is still formula_2-Erdős under this definition. Every formula_26-Erdős cardinal is an inaccessible limit of ineffable cardinals.

<text>Homework is a set of tasks assigned to students by their teachers to be completed at home. Common homework assignments may include required reading, a writing or typing project, mathematical exercises to be completed, information to be reviewed before a test, or other skills to be practiced.

The effects of homework are debated. Generally speaking, homework does not improve academic performance among young children. Homework may improve academic skills among older students, especially lower-achieving students. However, homework also creates stress for students and parents, and reduces the amount of time that students can spend in other activities.

== Purposes ==

The basic objectives of assigning homework to students often align with schooling in general. However, teachers have many purposes for assigning homework, including:
* reinforcing skills taught in class
* extending skills to new situations
* preparing for future class lessons
* engaging students in active learning
* developing time management and study skills
* promoting parent-student communications
* encouraging collaboration between students
* fulfilling school/district policies 
* demonstrating a rigorous school program to others
* punishing a student or a class

== Effects ==
=== Academic performance ===

Homework research dates back to the early 1900s. However, no consensus exists on the general effectiveness on homework. Results of homework studies vary based on multiple factors, such as the age group of those studied and the measure of academic performance.

Younger students who spend more time on homework generally have slightly worse, or the same academic performance, as those who spend less time on homework. Homework has not been shown to improve academic achievements for grade school students. Proponents claim that assigning homework to young children helps them learn good study habits. No research has ever been conducted to determine whether this claim has any merit.

Among teenagers, students who spend more time on homework generally have higher grades, and higher test scores than students who spend less time on homework. Large amounts of homework cause students&#x27; academic performance to worsen, even among older students. Students who are assigned homework in middle and high school score somewhat better on standardized tests, but the students who have more than 90 minutes of homework a day in middle school or more than two hours in high school score worse.

Low-achieving students receive more benefit from doing homework than high-achieving students. However, school teachers commonly assign less homework to the students who need it most, and more homework to the students who are performing well. In past centuries, homework was a cause of academic failure: when school attendance was optional, students would drop out of school entirely if they were unable to keep up with the homework assigned.

=== Non-academic ===
The amount of homework given does not necessarily affect students&#x27; attitudes towards homework and various other aspects of school.

 found a near-zero correlation between the amount of homework and parents&#x27; reports on how well their elementary school students behaved. studied 809 adolescents in American high schools, and found that, using the Normative Deviance Scale as a model for deviance, the correlation was for white students, and for African-American students. For all three of the correlations, higher values represent a higher correlation between time spent on homework and poor conduct.

 says that homework develops students&#x27; motivation and study skills. In a single study, parents and teachers of middle school students believed that homework improved students&#x27; study skills and personal responsibility skills. Their students were more likely to have negative perceptions about homework and were less likely to ascribe the development of such skills to homework. found that students generally had negative emotions when completing homework and reduced engagement compared to other activities.

=== Busy work ===
The intention of homework is to further test students&#x27; knowledge at home. However, there is a line between productive work and busy work. Busy work has no inherent value; it just occupies time. Karin Chenoweth provides an example of a student taking chemistry who must color a mole for homework. Chenoweth shared how busy work like this can have a negative effect on students, and explained that having this simple drawing is of no worth in terms of learning, yet it lowered the student&#x27;s grade in class. However, Miriam Ferzli et. al. point out that just because an assignment is time consuming does not give students the right to call an assignment &quot;busy work,&quot; which can be seen in the case of lab reports, which are indeed time consuming but which are also key to learning.

One way to promote productive learning starts in the classroom and then seeps into the homework. Brian Cook and Andrea Babon point to the difference between active and passive learning, noting that active learning promotes engagement and &quot;a deeper approach to learning that enables students to develop meaning from knowledge.&quot; Cook and Babon discuss the use of weekly quizzes, which are based on the course readings and which test each student&#x27;s understanding at the end of each week. Weekly quizzes engage not only students, but also teachers, who must look at what is commonly missed, review students&#x27; answers, and clear up any misunderstandings. 

Sarah Greenwald and Judy Holdener discuss the rise of online homework and report that &quot;online homework can increase student engagement, and students generally appreciate the immediate feedback offered by online homework systems as well as the ability to have multiple attempts after an incorrect solution.&quot; Greenwald and Holdener state that after creating effective homework assignments, teachers must also implement the learning from that homework. Greenwald and Holdener point to a teacher who uses a two-step homework process of connecting homework to classroom learning by first assigning homework followed by in-class presentations. The teacher says using class time for following up on homework gives that connection to what is learned in the class, noting, &quot;In the initial step students complete and submit (traditional) homework assignments electronically, and then later they revisit their work through presentations of selected problems during class. 

=== Health and daily life ===
Homework has been identified in numerous studies and articles as a dominant or significant source of stress and anxiety for students. Studies on the relation between homework and health are few compared to studies on academic performance.

 surveyed 1,983 students in Hong Kong, and found that homework led not only to added stress and anxiety, but also physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches. Students in the survey who were ridiculed or punished by parents and peers had a higher incidence of depression symptoms, with 2.2% of students reporting that they &quot;always&quot; had suicidal thoughts, and anxiety was exacerbated by punishments and criticism of students by teachers for both problems with homework as well as forgetting to hand in homework.

A 2007 study of American students by MetLife found that 89% of students felt stressed from homework, with 34% reporting that they &quot;often&quot; or &quot;very often&quot; felt stressed from homework. Stress was especially evident among high school students. Students that reported stress from homework were more likely to be deprived of sleep.

Homework can cause tension and conflict in the home as well as at school, and can reduce students&#x27; family and leisure time. In the survey, failure to complete homework and low grades where homework was a contributing factor was correlated with greater conflict; some students have reported teachers and parents frequently criticizing their work. In the MetLife study, high school students reported spending more time completing homework than performing home tasks. argued that homework can create family conflict and reduce students&#x27; quality of life. The authors of , both high school English teachers, reported that their homework disrupted their students&#x27; extracurricular activities and responsibilities. However, found that parents were less likely to report homework as a distraction from their children&#x27;s activities and responsibilities. recommended further empirical study relating to this aspect due to the difference between student and parent observations.

=== Time use ===
A University of Michigan Institute for Social Research nationally representative survey of American 15- to 17-year olds, conducted in 2003, found an average of 50 minutes of homework each weekday.

A 2019 Pew Research Center review of Bureau of Labor Statistics&#x27; American Time Use Survey data reported that 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds Americans, spent on average an hour a day on homework during the school year. The change in this demographic&#x27;s average daily time spent doing homework (during the school year) increased by about 16 minutes from 2003-2006 to 2014-2017. U.S. teenage girls spent more time doing homework than U.S. teenage boys.

A 2019 nationally representative survey of 95,505 freshmen at U.S. colleges, conducted by the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute, asked respondents, &quot;During your last year in high school, how much time did you spend during a typical week studying/doing homework?&quot; 1.9% of respondents said none, 7.4% said less than one hour, 19.5% said 1–2 hours, 27.9% said 3–5 hours, 21.4% said 6–10 hours, 11.4% said 11–15 hours, 6.0% said 16–20 hours, 4.5% said over 20 hours.

 surveyed 4,317 students from ten &quot;privileged, high-performing&quot; high schools in the U.S., and found that students reported spending more than 3 hours on homework daily. 72% of the students reported stress from homework, and 82% reported physical symptoms. The students slept an average of 6 hours 48 minutes, lower than recommendations prescribed by various health agencies.

===Benefits===
Some educators argue that homework is beneficial to students, as it enhances learning, develops the skills taught in class, and lets educators verify that students comprehend their lessons. Proponents also argue that homework makes it more likely that students will develop and maintain proper study habits that they can use throughout their educational career.

== History ==

=== United States ===
Historically, homework was frowned upon in American culture. With few students able to pursue higher education, and with many children and teenagers needing to dedicate significant amounts of time to chores and farm work, homework was disliked not only by parents, but also by some schools. The students&#x27; inability to keep up with the homework, which was largely memorizing an assigned text at home, contributed to students dropping out of school at a relatively early age. Attending school was not legally required, and if the student could not spend afternoons and evenings working on homework, then the student could quit school.

Complaints from parents were common at all levels of society. In 1880, Francis Amasa Walker convinced the school board in Boston to prohibit teachers from assigning math homework under normal circumstances. In 1900, journalist Edward Bok railed against schools assigning homework to students until age 15. He encouraged parents to send notes to their children&#x27;s teachers to demand the end of all homework assignments, and thousands of parents did so. Others looked at the new child labor laws in the United States and noted that school time plus homework exceeded the number of hours that a child would be permitted to work for pay. The campaign resulted in the US Congress receiving testimony to the effect that experts thought children should never have any homework, and that teenagers should be limited to a maximum of two hours of homework per day. In 1901, the California legislature passed an act that effectively abolished homework for anyone under the age of 15. While homework was generally out of favor in the first half of the 20th century, some people supported homework reform, such as by making the assignments more relevant to the students&#x27; non-school lives, rather than prohibiting it.

In the 1950s, with increasing pressure on the United States to stay ahead in the Cold War, homework made a resurgence, and children were encouraged to keep up with their Russian counterparts. From that time on, social attitudes have oscillated approximately on a 15-year cycle: homework was encouraged in the 1950s to mid-1960s; it was rejected from the mid-1960s until 1980; it was encouraged again from 1980 and the publication of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; until the mid-1990s, when the Cold War ended. At that time, American schools were overwhelmingly in favor of issuing some homework to students of all grade levels. Homework was less favored after the end of the Cold War.

=== United Kingdom ===
British students get more homework than many other countries in Europe. The weekly average for the subject is 5 hours. The main distinction for UK homework is the social gap, with middle-class teenagers getting a disproportionate amount of homework compared to Asia and Europe.

=== Spain ===
In 2012, a report by the OECD showed that Spanish children spend 6.4 hours a week on homework. This prompted the CEAPA, representing 12,000 Spanish parent associations, to call for a homework strike.

== Criticism ==

Homework and its effects, justifications, motivations and alleged benefits have been the subject of sharp criticism among many education experts and researchers.

According to a study by the Dresden University of Technology, homework—described in the study as &quot;an educational ritual&quot;—has little to no influence on academic performance.

When assigning homework, each student is usually given the same exercises, regardless of how well the student is performing. This leaves some students under-challenged and others overwhelmed by their homework. For others, the degree of difficulty of homework may be appropriate, but students are unable to decide for themselves whether they need to deepen their knowledge in a particular subject or whether to use the time in other subjects with which they experience more difficulty, despite the fact that homework is often seen as a way of encouraging self-regulation.

Homework is sometimes used to outsource school material not completed in class to the home, leaving children with homework that is not designed to be done on their own and parents feeling helpless and frustrated. As a consequence, students often have to use the internet or other resources for help, which provides disadvantages for students without internet access. Thus, such homework fails to promote equality of opportunity. Homework without professional feedback from the teacher has little effect on the learning success of students.

Even if it is generally not wanted by homework distributors (unless homework is given as a punishment), completing homework may take up a large part of the student&#x27;s free time. It is often the case that children procrastinate on doing their homework until late at night, which can lead to sleep disorders and unhealthy stress. Children may feel overwhelmed when they have too much homework, which can negatively affect children&#x27;s natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge.

A study by the UCL Institute of Education, which concerned the impact of homework in different countries, discovered that the pressure associated with homework causes arguments among family members. The study also showed that homework can lead to anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion among children.

<doc id="326547" wikidata="Q1415387" url="?curid=326547" title="Competitive dance">
<text>Competitive dance is a popular, widespread sport in which competitors perform dances in any of several permitted dance styles—such as acro, ballet, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, lyrical, modern, musical theatre, tap, and improv—before a common group of judges. This is in contrast with other activities that involve competition among dancers based on purpose, or specific dance styles or genres, such as pom squad and dancesport (competitive ballroom dance).

The competitive dance industry largely consists of &quot;competition production companies&quot;—also sometimes called &quot;dance competition companies and dance competition lines&quot;—that conduct regional competitions at stops along their annual, nationwide tours. Dancers who compete at these regional competitions are students ranging in age from approximately five to eighteen years old. After competing regionally, qualifying routines and studios go on to compete nationally towards the end of their season. Dance schools (often referred to as dance studios) arrange for their classes to compete in a range of disciplines as solos, duets, trios, or in a small group dance in addition to or in place of large group routines. Competitions typically begin in January and end in July or August.

Competitive dancers must be physically fit because even short dances can be physically demanding. Dancers must continuously train to maintain and improve their technique, balance skills, strength and flexibility. Dance studios typically advise their students to avoid activities that put them at risk for injury or illness, especially while attending competitions. 

Except for holidays and short breaks during the summer, competitive dancing is typically a year-round activity: dancers attend classes during competition season, to refine their competitive routines, and during off-season to prepare for the next upcoming competition season. Some dancers attend dance intensives during the summer to improve technique. These intensives normally last a few weeks and happen in various locations around the world. Intensives are typically very intense, as the dancers follow rigorous schedules. Twelve hour or more days are extremely likely, as many classes and activities are crammed into each day.

==Competition==

===Dance music===

The music used in competitive dance routines is typically adapted from commercially available songs created by professional recording artists. Dance routines are subject to time limits at most dance competitions, and consequently the original, commercial music is usually edited to conform to such time limits.

===Standards===
There is no industry-wide standard for scoring, but awards are typically awarded in this order: Bronze, High Bronze, Silver, High Silver, Gold, High Gold, Platinum, High Platinum, and Diamond. The maximum number of points issued by each judge, as well as the maximum possible final score, varies among competition production companies. Although it is common for judges to issue a maximum of 100 points each, at least one company implements a system in which judges may issue up to 200 points, based on the rationale that such a scoring system is similar to that employed in public schools.
Although scoring at dance competitions vary, judges usually give scores based on score technique, performance, costume, music, and difficulty level of the performance. Each competition&#x27;s ranks are different. The performances are usually ranked within each dance category. 

Most competitions have opportunities for dancers to win title positions. Titles include Mr. and Miss Dance for petites (ages commonly 8 and under), juniors (ages 9–11), teens (12–14), and seniors (15–19). These competitions normally include dancers who choose to pay an extra fee to run for title.

==Competitions==

===Competitive dance industry===
Dance competitions are organized and conducted by independent competition production companies. In 2007 there were at least 150 such companies operating in the United States and Canada alone. Competition production companies move from one metropolitan area to another, stopping for a few days in each area to conduct a regional competition. By touring in this manner, these companies are able to generate profits while at the same time enabling significant numbers of dancers to attend local competitions. Some companies also conduct one or more national competitions after their regional tours have ended.

The competitive dance industry has no oversight body or standards organization, although at least one effort was attempted to establish a limited set of competition rules and safety standards in the industry. Competition production companies seldom coordinate their tours with each other. Tour start and end dates, as well as cities visited, vary from one company to another. Most companies conduct regional tours from approximately January through May, while National competitions generally run from June through August. It is not uncommon for two regional tours to be visiting the same metropolitan area at the same time.

===Competitive divisions===
Dances and performers typically are categorized in various ways so as to create different competitive divisions. These categories are not standardized, and may vary significantly from one competition to another:
* Age – Each dancer is assigned to a particular age division, wherein each division encompasses a range of ages.
* Experience – Each dance is assigned to a particular competitive division based on performers&#x27; experience.
* Group size – Dances are also categorized according to the number of performers. Common categories include solo (one performer), duo/trio (two or three performers), and various numbers of group divisions, each of various size.
These divisions are intended to ensure that dancers will compete against others of the same age and experience, and similarly sized groups, and thus avoid unfair comparisons (e.g., beginner vs. advanced).

===Videography and photography===
The choreography of a dance routine—which is the design of movement and flow of steps in the routine—is copyrightable. Consequently, video recording is often prohibited at dance competitions in order to steer clear of copyright infringement issues. Nowadays, most competition companies tahke photos and videos for dance schools. When no professional videographer is available, competition production companies will sometimes permit each attending dance school to designate a videographer to record performances of students from that school.

Unlike videography, still photography does not infringe copyrighted choreography. Because of this, many competition production companies permit photography at their competitions. Virtually all competitions prohibit flash photography, however, both for the safety of performers and to prevent undesirable distractions. Some competition production companies employ professional photographers to capture and sell photographs of dance performances. In such cases, photography by audience members is typically prohibited so as to provide an exclusive market for the official photographers.

=== In popular culture ===
Dance competitions became more known to the public after the debut of the television show &quot;Dance Moms&quot;. &quot;Dance Moms&quot; featured a competitive dance studio and its dancers as these dancers attended regional and national competitions.

<text>In mathematics, subtle cardinals and ethereal cardinals are closely related kinds of large cardinal number.

A cardinal formula_1 is called subtle if for every closed and unbounded formula_2 and for every sequence formula_3 of length formula_1 such that formula_5 for all formula_6 (where formula_7 is the formula_8th element), there exist formula_9, belonging to formula_10, with formula_11, such that formula_12.

A cardinal formula_1 is called ethereal if for every closed and unbounded formula_2 and for every sequence formula_3 of length formula_1 such that formula_5 and formula_7 has the same cardinality as formula_8 for arbitrary formula_6, there exist formula_9, belonging to formula_10, with formula_11, such that formula_24.

Subtle cardinals were introduced by . Ethereal cardinals were introduced by . Any subtle cardinal is ethereal,p. 388 and any strongly inaccessible ethereal cardinal is subtle.p. 391

==Characterizations==
Some equivalent properties to subtlety are known.

===Relationship to Vopěnka&#x27;s Principle===
Subtle cardinals are equivalent to a weak form of Vopěnka cardinals. Namely, an inaccessible cardinal formula_1 is subtle if and only if in formula_26, any logic has stationarily many weak compactness cardinals.

Vopenka&#x27;s principle itself may be stated as the existence of a strong compactness cardinal for each logic.

===Chains in transitive sets===
There is a subtle cardinal formula_27 if and only if every transitive set formula_28 of cardinality formula_1 contains formula_30 and formula_31 such that formula_30 is a proper subset of formula_31 and formula_34 and formula_35.Corollary 2.6 An infinite ordinal formula_1 is subtle if and only if for every formula_37, every transitive set formula_28 of cardinality formula_1 includes a chain (under inclusion) of order type formula_40.

==Extensions==
A hypersubtle cardinal is a subtle cardinal which has a stationary set of subtle cardinals below it.p.1014

<doc id="326552" wikidata="Q1142087" url="?curid=326552" title="Sino-Korean vocabulary">
<text>Sino-Korean vocabulary or Hanja-eo () refers to Korean words of Chinese origin. Sino-Korean vocabulary includes words borrowed directly from Chinese, as well as new Korean words created from Chinese characters, and words borrowed from Sino-Japanese vocabulary. Many of these terms were borrowed during the height of Chinese-language literature on Korean culture. Subsequently, many of these words have also been truncated or altered for the Korean language.

Estimates of the percentage of Sino-Korean ranges from as low as 30% to as high as 70%. According to the &quot;Standard Korean Language Dictionary&quot; published by the National Institute of Korean Language (NIKL), Sino-Korean represents approximately 57% of the Korean vocabulary.

== History ==
The use of Chinese and Chinese characters in Korea dates back to at least 194 BCE. While Sino-Korean words were widely used during the Three Kingdoms period, they became even more popular during the Silla period. During this time, male aristocrats changed their given names to Sino-Korean names. Additionally, the government changed all official titles and place names in the country to Sino-Korean.

Sino-Korean words remained popular during the Goryeo and Joseon periods. Ultimately, the majority of Sino-Korean words were introduced before 1945, including Sino-Japanese words themselves that were introduced to Korea during Japanese Occupation. In the contemporary era, Sino-Korean vocabulary has continued to grow in South Korea, where the meanings of Chinese characters are used to produce new words in Korean that do not exist in Chinese. By contrast, North Korean policy has called for many Sino-Korean words to be replaced by native Korean terms.

== Usage ==
Sino-Korean words constitute a large portion of South Korean vocabulary, the remainder being native Korean words and loanwords from other languages, such as Japanese and English to a lesser extent. Sino-Korean words are typically used in formal or literary contexts, and to express abstract or complex ideas.

All Korean surnames and most Korean given names are Sino-Korean. Additionally, Korean numerals can be expressed with Sino-Korean and native Korean words, though each set of numerals has different purposes.

Sino-Korean words may be written either in the Korean alphabet, known as Hangul, or in Chinese characters, known as Hanja.

== Examples ==
=== Words borrowed from Chinese ===
Sino-Korean words borrowed directly from Chinese come mainly from Chinese classics, literature, and colloquial Chinese.
=== Words created in Korea using Chinese characters ===
These words below were created in Korea using Chinese characters. They are not used in China, Japan, nor Vietnam.
=== Words borrowed from Sino-Japanese ===
Sino-Korean words borrowed from Sino-Japanese are used only in Korean and Japanese, not in Chinese.
== Phonetic correspondences ==
=== Initial consonants ===
=== Final consonants ===
The Middle Chinese final consonants were semivowels (or glides) /j/ and /w/, nasals /m/, /n/ and /ŋ/, and stops /p/, /t/ and /k/. Sino-Korean preserves all the distinctions between final nasals and stops. Although Old Korean had a /t/ coda, words with the Middle Chinese coda /t/ have /l/ in Sino-Korean, reflecting a northern variety of Late Middle Chinese in which final /t/ had weakened to /r/.

<doc id="326566" wikidata="Q89556" url="?curid=326566" title="Concertina wire">
<text>Concertina wire or Dannert wire is a type of barbed wire or razor wire that is formed in large coils which can be expanded like a concertina. In conjunction with plain barbed wire (and/or razor wire/tape) and steel pickets, it is most often used to form military-style wire obstacles. It is also used in non-military settings, such as when used in prison barriers, detention camps, riot control, or at international borders.
During World War I, soldiers manufactured concertina wire themselves, using ordinary barbed wire. Today, it is factory made.

== Origins ==

In World War I, barbed wire obstacles were made by stretching lengths of barbed wire between stakes of wood or iron. At its simplest, such a barrier would resemble a fence as might be used for agricultural purposes. The double apron fence comprised a line of pickets with wires running diagonally down to points on the ground either side of the fence. Horizontal wires were attached to these diagonals.

More elaborate and formidable obstructions could be formed with multiple lines of stakes connected with wire running from side-to-side, back-to-front, and diagonally in many directions. Effective as these obstacles were, their construction took considerable time.

Barbed wire obstacles were vulnerable to being pushed about by artillery shells; in World War I, this frequently resulted in a mass of randomly entangled wires that could be even more daunting than a carefully constructed obstacle. Learning this lesson, World War I soldiers would deploy barbed wire in so-called concertinas that were relatively loose. Barbed wire concertinas could be prepared in the trenches and then deployed in no-man&#x27;s-land relatively quickly under cover of darkness.

Concertina wire packs flat for ease of transport and can then be deployed as an obstacle much more quickly than ordinary barbed wire, since the flattened coil of wire can easily be stretched out, forming an instant obstacle that will at least slow enemy passage. Several such coils with a few stakes to secure them in place are just as effective as an ordinary barbed wire fence, which must be built by driving stakes and running multiple wires between them.

A platoon of soldiers can deploy a single concertina fence at a rate of about a kilometre ( mile) per hour. Such an obstacle is not very effective by itself (although it will still hinder an enemy advance under the guns of the defenders), and concertinas are normally built up into more elaborate patterns as time permits.

Today, concertina wire is factory made and is available in forms that can be deployed very rapidly from the back of a vehicle or trailer.

== Dannert wire ==
Oil-tempered barbed wire was developed during World War I; it was much harder to cut than ordinary barbed wire. During the 1930s, German Horst Dannert developed concertina wire of this high-grade steel wire. The result was entirely self-supporting; it did not require any vertical posts. An individual Dannert wire concertina could be compressed into a compact coil that could be carried by one man and then stretched out along its axis to make a barrier long and each coil could be held in place with just three staples hammered into the ground.

Dannert wire was imported into Britain from Germany before World War II. During the invasion crisis of 1940–1941, the demand for Dannert wire was so great that some was produced with low manganese steel wire which was easier to cut. This material was known as &quot;Yellow Dannert&quot; after the identifying yellow paint on the concertina handles. To compensate for the reduced effectiveness of Yellow Dannert, an extra supply of pickets were issued in lieu of screw pickets.

== Triple concertina wire ==
A barrier known as a triple concertina wire fence consists of two parallel concertinas joined by twists of wire and topped by a third concertina similarly attached. The result is an extremely effective barrier with many of the desirable properties of a random entanglement. A triple concertina fence could be deployed very quickly: it is possible for a party of five men to deploy of triple concertina fence in just 15 minutes. Optionally, triple concertina fence could be strengthened with uprights, but this increases the construction time significantly.

== &quot;Constantine&quot; wire ==
Concertina wire is sometimes mistakenly called &quot;constantine&quot; wire. &quot;Constantine&quot; probably came from a corruption/misunderstanding of &quot;concertina&quot; and led to confusion with the Roman Emperor Constantine. This, in turn, has led to some people trying to differentiate between concertina wire and &quot;constantine&quot; wire by assigning the term &quot;constantine wire&quot; to what is commonly known as razor wire. In contrast to the helical construction of concertina wire, razor wire consists of a single wire with teeth that project periodically along its length.

<text>Mafalda () is an Argentine comic strip written and drawn by cartoonist Quino. The strip features a six-year-old girl named Mafalda, who reflects the Argentine middle class and progressive youth, is concerned about humanity and world peace, and has an innocent but serious attitude toward problems. The comic strip ran from 1964 to 1973 and was very popular in Latin America, Europe, Quebec and Asia. Its popularity led to books and two animated cartoon series. &quot;Mafalda&quot; has been praised as masterful satire.

==History==
The comic strip artist Quino created &quot;Mafalda&quot; in 1963. He had received a proposal by fellow artist Miguel Brascó, and the comic strip would be a covert advertisement for the &quot;Mansfield&quot; line of products of the Siam Di Tella company. The characters would use their products, and all of them would have names starting with &quot;M&quot;. The name &quot;Mafalda&quot; was selected as an homage to one of the characters of the 1962 Argentine film &quot;Dar la cara&quot;. The comic strip was conceived as a blend of &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Blondie&quot;. Quino and Brascó offered the comic strip to the newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot;, but they noticed the advertisement nature and did not publish it. The covert advertising campaign was never carried out, but Brascó published portions of those comics at the magazine &quot;Leoplán&quot;.
Julián Delgado, senior editor of the magazine &quot;Primera Plana&quot;, proposed Quino to publish the comic strip, if he removed the advertisements. It was first published in the magazine on 29 September 1964. Initially, it featured only Mafalda and her parents. Felipe was introduced in January. Quino left the magazine in 1965, and the comic strip moved to the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;. Quino introduced new kids: Manolito, Susanita, and Miguelito; and Mafalda&#x27;s mother became pregnant. The newspaper was closed in December 1967.

Publication resumed six months later, on 2 June 1968, in the weekly &quot;Siete Días Ilustrados&quot;. Since the cartoons now had to be delivered two weeks before publication, Quino was not able to comment on the news to the same extent. After creating the characters of Mafalda&#x27;s little brother Guille and her new friend Libertad, he definitively ceased publication of the strip on 25 June 1973.

After 1973, Quino still drew &quot;Mafalda&quot; a few times, mostly to promote human rights. In 1976, he reproduced Mafalda for the UNICEF illustrating the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==Characters==
The comic strip is composed of the main character Mafalda, her parents and a group of other children. However, the group was not created on purpose, but was instead a result of the development of the comic strip. The other children were created one at a time, and worked by countering specific aspects of Mafalda. The exception was Guille, Mafalda&#x27;s brother, who was introduced during a period when the author did not have other ideas.

* Mafalda: A six-year-old girl with a great concern for the state of humanity. She often leaves her parents at a loss by asking about mature or complex topics. As an example, she gets chided to concern herself with childlike things instead of asking about China&#x27;s communism; in response, she pretends to play with bubbles in soapy water only to promptly proclaim that she is done and then ask about China once more. Although she uses her intelligence to manipulate her parents into letting her do what she wants at times, she is shown to be very benevolent and righteous, and does what she can for her family and friends. Mafalda is generally a pessimist to the point of being accused of being so by her friends; to this she responds that things are not so bad as to stop discussing them. A constant trait is her dislike of soup.
* Mamá (&quot;Mom&quot;) (Raquel, 6 October 1964) and Papá (&quot;Dad&quot;) (Alberto, 29 September 1964): Mafalda&#x27;s parents are a very normal couple, more concerned with family welfare than external political or social issues. Mafalda is often critical of her mom&#x27;s ready acceptance of housewife status; her dad often tries to avoid Mafalda&#x27;s snarky remarks and probing questions, although he very much sympathizes with the kid&#x27;s scary view of school life. He is an avid horticulturist, and proven capable of rambling on about specific topics if given the chance. Raquel appears to have been a talented pianist who left college before graduating in order to marry and raise a family; Mafalda&#x27;s father has a job as some sort of insurance agent and occasionally smokes. Their car is a Citroën 3CV hatchback, which was a popular entry-level model for middle-class Argentines in the 1960s.
* Felipe (&quot;Phillip&quot;) (19 January 1965): The brightest and oldest member of the gang, Felipe is a good-natured dreamer who is usually lost in his fantasies and imagination and is also deeply scared of school. He often wages intense internal battles with his conscience, innate sense of responsibility, and top school grades that he hates (&quot;That is the worst good news I&#x27;ve ever been given!&quot;). A consummate procrastinator, he loves to play cowboys and read comics, especially the Lone Ranger. Late in the series, he also has a crush on a girl named Muriel (name given by Susanita). He is characterized by his hair and buckteeth. When Mafalda drew a picture with an uncanny likeness to him, she says she used a shoe with a carrot at an angle for a model.
* Manolito (Manuel Goreiro Jr., 29 March 1965): The son of a Spanish shopkeeper, he is sometimes referred to as &quot;gallego&quot; (Galician). His surname hints at such an origin, but it is common practice in Argentina to refer to all Spanish migrants as Galicians. Manolito and his father follow the Argentine stereotype of the , dull and stingy. While his family business is but a small, local grocery store, he seems ambitious with his career and is more concerned with notions of business, capitalism, and dollars, than anything else. He&#x27;s always promoting the store and its products in street graffiti and even in ordinary conversations. He&#x27;s shown to be simple-minded, but sometimes appears creative when it comes to business plans. He never goes on a vacation because of his father, who owns the store they work in; both appear to enjoy making money and upon Manolito suggesting closing shop and going on a vacation for a few days, his dad appeared to have fainted from shock. The quality of the products sold is often questionable, as many people have complained to him and/or his father often. Manolito is characterized by his brush-like hair, which runs in the males of the family, and in one strip it is seen as growing quickly back right after it has been shaved.
* Susanita (Susana Beatriz Clotilde Chirusi, 6 June 1965): A frivolous girl with curly blond hair, who displays stereotypical feminine traits; her life revolves around femininity, gossip, dreams of marriage and maternity, and woman antagonism. Her dream is to be a mother and dedicated housewife and she often fantasizes about the possibilities, which often leads to arguments with Mafalda. She is, however, the latter&#x27;s best female friend despite their bickering (&quot;Well... you know... I&#x27;d rather freak out at you than at a complete stranger&quot;) She and Manolito seem to be at odds, but tolerate each other for Mafalda&#x27;s sake, although it is shown that Susanita is more often the perpetrator of their bickering; as the attacks are often one-sided, Manolito is caught off-guard most of the times, but on occasion he gains the upper hand. At times, she seems to have a crush on Felipe. She is sometimes shown as a glutton, usually regretting sharing with her friends or tricking them out of their snack. She is also racist to a major extent, though at one point she denies this (and unknowingly makes a racist remark that contradicts her point).
* Miguelito (Miguel Pitti, 1966): About two years younger than Felipe and one year younger than Mafalda and the others, characterized by his lettuce-shaped hair. He appears in the series sometime later. Somewhat of a rebel, most of the time he is a little too eager to get into philosophical debates. Although he is characterized as &quot;innocent&quot; by his friends (and, indeed, proving to be very naive at times), he often surprises them with comments ridden with cynicism, pedantry, and even sociopathy. A descendant of Italian immigrants, his grandfather is very fond of Benito Mussolini. He appears to have a harsh, houseproud mother, of whom he is frightened.
* Guille (Guillermo, 1968) or Nando in some translations: Mafalda&#x27;s little brother. He loves soup (much to his sister&#x27;s chagrin), has a pathological dependence on his pacifier, and he and Mafalda have a pet tortoise called Burocracia (&quot;Bureaucracy&quot;). He is somewhat cynical and prone to histrionics, with the prime target being his mother. He is a bit of a troublemaker and appears to share the same trait as his sister in terms of bringing up awkward topics of discussion.
* Libertad (5 February 1970): &quot;Libertad&quot; is a given name in Spanish, which means &quot;Freedom&quot;. The girl is of small stature (a little shorter than Guille although she is around the age of the other kids), a reference to the impotence or small stature of freedom. Libertad appears somewhat later in the series, after Mafalda befriends her at the beach during a vacation, where she introduces herself to Mafalda, and, after an awkward silence, she inquires: &quot;Have you drawn your stupid conclusion yet? Everyone draws their stupid conclusion when they meet me&quot;. She is the most politically radical character of the comic strip, more even than Mafalda herself. She took the place of being the political one while Mafalda became more well rounded in her topics of discussion. Although she claims to be fond of simple people, she often overthinks or overreacts to her friend&#x27;s opinions on simple topics like vacations or pets. She often gets in trouble with her teachers due to her point of view.
* Muriel: Felipe&#x27;s crush. Although he could never actually speak to his neighbor, it appears that Susanita knows everything about her, as well as everything else, because of her gossipy behaviour. Although she is not part of the gang, she appears occasionally on strips always featuring Felipe&#x27;s lack of concentration when she is near, or his attempts to encourage himself to make conversation with her, attempts of which Felipe has never been able to carry out due to his extreme shyness.

The characters aged at about half the real time-scale while the script ran. They also went through minor changes largely due to the evolution of Quino&#x27;s drawing style.

==Books and translations==
Most strips that were not too closely tied to then-current events were chronologically republished in ten small books simply named &quot;Mafalda&quot; and numbered from one to ten, with two strips on each page. This excludes the very first ones, published in &quot;Primera Plana,&quot; but never reprinted until 1989.

The Argentine editions are as follows, published by Ediciones de la Flor (except for the first five books, which were first published by Editorial Jorge Álvarez)
* &quot;Mafalda&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Así es la cosa, Mafalda&quot; (&quot;This is the way things are, Mafalda&quot;) (1967)
* &quot;Mafalda 3&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Mafalda 4&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Mafalda 5&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Mafalda 6&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Mafalda 7&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Mafalda 8&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Mafalda 9&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Mafalda 10&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Mafalda Inédita&quot; (&quot;Unpublished Mafalda&quot;) (1989)
* &quot;10 Años con Mafalda&quot; (&quot;Ten years with Mafalda&quot;) (1991)
* &quot;Toda Mafalda&quot; (&quot;The Whole Mafalda&quot;) (1992)

The editions differ in other countries: in Spain, the small books are numbered from 0 to 10 and the full compilation is called &quot;Todo Mafalda&quot;, all published by Editorial Lumen; in Mexico, the small books go from 1 to 12 and are currently published by Tusquets Editores.

Mafalda has been translated into around twenty languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Guarani, Hebrew, and Armenian. There is also a Spanish Braille version. In the United States of America, his only published work is &quot;The World of Quino&quot; (1986); an English version of Mafalda for the Anglophone market, translated by Frank Wynne, is scheduled to be released in 2025 by Elsewhere Editions.

Beginning in 2004, Quino&#x27;s publisher in Argentina, Ediciones de la Flor, started publishing English-language collections of &quot;Mafalda&quot; strips under the series title &quot;Mafalda &amp; Friends&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Quino has opposed adapting &quot;Mafalda&quot; for cinema or theater; however, two series of animated shorts featuring Mafalda have been produced. The first, a series of 260 90-second films, was produced by Daniel Mallo for Argentine television starting in 1972. These were adapted into a full-length movie by Carlos Márquez in 1979 and released in 1981. It remains relatively unknown. In 1993 Cuban filmmaker Juan Padrón, a close friend of Quino, directed 104 short animated &quot;Mafalda&quot; films, backed by Spanish producers.

In 2024, a Netflix-exclusive &quot;Mafalda&quot; animated series was announced; it will be written by director Juan José Campanella.

==Comparisons==
&quot;Mafalda&quot; has occasionally been pointed out as being influenced by Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;, most notably by Umberto Eco, in 1968, who contrasted the two characters. While Eco thought of &quot;Mafalda&quot; and &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; as the unheard voices of children in the northern and southern hemispheres, Quino saw &quot;Mafalda&quot; as a socio-political strip, firmly rooted on family values. This is one of the reasons adults play a starring role in the strip, while they are never seen in the &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; universe. Quino does, however, acknowledge the influence of Schulz&#x27;s work on his, in that Quino extensively studied Schulz&#x27;s books in preparation for an advertising campaign he was working on in 1963. The advertising campaign was scrapped but he reused some of the material for the &quot;Mafalda&quot; series a year later.

The appearance of &quot;Mafalda&quot;&#x27;s character resembles that of the main character in the U.S. comic strip &quot;Nancy&quot; (known as &quot;Periquita&quot; in Latin America). There is also a reference in a strip where &quot;Miguelito&quot; buys a magazine that has &quot;Nancy&quot; on the cover, and asks &quot;Mafalda&quot; whom she looks like. In the next panel is implied that &quot;Mafalda&quot; replied, &quot;¡Tu abuela!&quot; (&quot;Your granny!&quot;), a phrase similar to &quot;Your mama!&quot; in English, as &quot;Miguelito&quot; stares at the magazine wondering, &quot;&quot;My&quot; granny?&quot;

==Recognition==

In 2009, a life-sized statue of Mafalda was installed in front of Quino&#x27;s old home in the San Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires.

In 2010, it was announced that the city of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, had sought and obtained permission to name or rename a street after Mafalda, as part of a project to establish a neighbourhood named after famous comic strips and &quot;bande dessinée&quot; characters.

In 2014, a life-sized statue of Mafalda was installed in Campo de San Francisco, a park located in Oviedo, Principality of Asturias&#x27; capital (northern Spain), after the Princess of Asturias Awards was conferred to Quino, for the creation of Mafalda, in the category of Communications and Humanities.

<doc id="326572" wikidata="Q6497470" url="?curid=326572" title="Attorney–client privilege">
<text>Attorney–client privilege or lawyer–client privilege is the common law doctrine of legal professional privilege in the United States. Attorney–client privilege is &quot;[a] client&#x27;s right to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications between the client and the attorney.&quot; 

The attorney–client privilege is one of the oldest privileges for confidential communications. The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make &quot;full and frank&quot; disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.

== Kovel Standard ==
With respect to experts that are hired by the attorneys, the attorney-client privilege is referred to as a &quot;Kovel standard&quot; based on the case of United States v. Kovel, 296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961) or broadly a &quot;Kovel Agreement&quot;. Experts hired by attorneys to assist in representation of a client may vary by profession. Such experts can be such as CPAs, Actuaries, medical doctors, or engineers. These experts may be disclosed or undisclosed to the Court. In the United States disclosed Expert witnesses may not be covered under the Kovel Standard, depending on the Court and the nature of their work, and their involvement in the legal advice process.

==General requirements under United States law==
Although there are minor variations, the elements necessary to establish the attorney–client privilege generally are:

# The asserted holder of the privilege is (or sought to become) a client; and
# The person to whom the communication was made:
## is a member of the bar of a court, or a subordinate of such a member, and
## in connection with this communication, is acting as an attorney; and
# The communication was for the purpose of securing legal advice.

There are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most jurisdictions, chief among them:
#the communication was made in the presence of individuals who were neither attorney nor client, or was disclosed to such individuals,
#the communication was made for the purpose of committing a crime or tort,
#the client has waived the privilege (for example by publicly disclosing the communication).

A corollary to the attorney–client privilege is the joint defense privilege, which is also called the common interest rule. The common interest rule &quot;serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to another party where a joint defense or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel.&quot;

An attorney speaking publicly in regard to a client&#x27;s personal business and private affairs can be reprimanded by the bar or disbarred, regardless of the fact that he or she may be no longer representing the client. Discussing a client&#x27;s or past client&#x27;s criminal history, or otherwise, is viewed as a breach of confidentiality.

The attorney–client privilege is separate from and should not be confused with the work-product doctrine.

==When the privilege may not apply==
When an attorney is not acting primarily as an attorney but, for instance, as a business advisor, member of the Board of Directors, or in another non-legal role, then the privilege generally does not apply.

The privilege protects the confidential communication, and not the underlying information. For instance, if a client has previously disclosed confidential information to a third party who is not an attorney, and then gives the same information to an attorney, the attorney–client privilege will still protect the communication to the attorney, but will not protect the communication with the third party.

The privilege may be waived if the confidential communications are disclosed to third parties.

Other limits to the privilege may apply depending on the situation being adjudicated.

===Crime–fraud exception===

The crime–fraud exception can render the privilege moot when communications between an attorney and client are themselves used to further a crime, tort, or fraud. In &quot;Clark v. United States&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that &quot;A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.&quot; The crime–fraud exception also &quot;does&quot; require that the crime or fraud discussed between client and attorney be carried out to be triggered. U.S. courts have not yet conclusively ruled how little knowledge an attorney can have of the underlying crime or fraud before the privilege detaches and the attorney&#x27;s communications or requisite testimony become admissible.

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer&#x27;s own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public&#x27;s access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness—a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such action.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===

Another case is for the probate of a last will and testament. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and testator may be disclosed in order to prove that a will represented the intent of the now deceased decedent. In many instances, the will, codicil, or other parts of the estate plan require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney&#x27;s file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the will may leave a legacy to a paramour or a natural child.

Courts have occasionally revoked the privilege after the death of the client if it is deemed that doing so serves the client&#x27;s intent, such as in the case of resolving testamentary disputes among heirs.

==Tax practice==
In the United States, communications between accountants and their clients are usually not privileged. A person who is worried about accusations of questionable accounting, such as tax evasion, may decide to work only with an attorney or only with an accountant who is also an attorney; some or all of the resulting communications may be privileged provided that all the requirements for the attorney–client privilege are met. The mere fact that the practitioner is an attorney will not create a valid attorney–client privilege with respect to a communication. For example, if the practitioner provides business or accounting advice rather than legal advice attorney–client privilege might not be established.

Under federal tax law in the United States, for communications on or after July 22, 1998, there is a limited federally authorized accountant–client privilege that may apply to certain communications with non-attorneys.

==In the federal courts==
If a case arises in the federal court system, the federal court will apply Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to determine whether to apply the privilege law of the relevant state or federal common law. If the case is brought to the federal court under diversity jurisdiction, the law of the relevant state will be used to apply the privilege. If the case involves a federal question, the federal court will apply the federal common law of attorney–client privilege; however, Rule 501 grants flexibility to the federal courts, allowing them to construe the privilege &quot;in light of experience and reason&quot;.

FRE 502(b) provides that inadvertent disclosures during a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency do not act as a waiver of the privilege if the holder of the privilege &quot;took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure&quot; in the first place and &quot;promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error.&quot; Parties cannot merely state that they took &quot;reasonable steps to prevent disclosure,&quot; instead they must give the court a detailed account of the procedures they took. Further, merely sending a letter demanding the return of privileged documents after discovering their inadvertent disclosure may not satisfy the requisite prompt response required.

<text>The Central Baptist Association is an association of churches located from South Carolina to Indiana, with most of the churches being in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. In 1956, some churches of the Eastern District Primitive Baptist Association separated and formed the Central Baptist Association. The churches entering this new organization desired to be more progressive and to provide a home for homeless and destitute children. They adopted the name Central Baptist &quot;as an indication of our acceptance of the Holy Scriptures in their entirety, varying neither to the right or left&quot; (Minutes, 1996, p.4). In 1996 there were almost 4000 members in 34 churches located in five states. Currently they have headquarters in Jasper, Virginia, including a tabernacle, a children&#x27;s home and a youth Bible camp.

&quot;The work of the Association includes the building of a fellowship of churches to provide, first for a general union of churches; second, to preserve inviolable a chain of communion among the churches; third, to give the churches all necessary advice and help in matters of church difficulty, so far as this is possible by peaceful methods: assisting churches in a Sunday School program for all ages, weekly prayer meetings, worship services, a monthly business meeting, an active youth program, Bible teaching, evangelistic and missionary work, visitation program, aiding established churches in organizing new churches and related projects; also support a home for adults and a children&#x27;s home, youth camp, and Bible camp for all ages.&quot; (Minutes, 1996, p.4)

<doc id="326578" wikidata="Q437088" url="?curid=326578" title="Brooke Astor">
<text>Roberta Brooke Astor (née Russell; March 30, 1902 – August 13, 2007) was an American philanthropist, socialite, and writer. She served as the chairwoman of the Vincent Astor Foundation, established by her third husband, Vincent Astor, who was a member of the Astor family. Brooke Astor was the author of two novels and two volumes of personal memoirs.

==Early life==
Roberta Brooke Russell was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the only child of John Henry Russell Jr., the 16th Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Mabel Cecile Hornby Howard. Her paternal grandfather John Henry Russell Sr. was a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. She was named for her maternal grandmother (Roberta) and was known as Bobby to close friends and family.

Due to her father&#x27;s career she spent much of her childhood abroad living in China, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and other places. She briefly attended The Madeira School in 1919, but graduated from the Holton-Arms School. As a child she kept diaries, letters and drawings from her travels, which were published in an illustrated edition of her memoir &quot;Patchwork Child: Early Memories&quot; in 1993.

==Marriages==

===John Dryden Kuser===
She married her first husband, John Dryden Kuser (1897–1964), shortly after her 17th birthday, on April 26, 1919, in Washington, D.C. &quot;I certainly wouldn&#x27;t advise getting married that young to anyone,&quot; she said later in life. &quot;At the age of sixteen, you&#x27;re not jelled yet. The first thing you look at, you fall in love with.&quot;

John was the son of the financier and conservationist Anthony Rudolph Kuser and Susie Fairfield Drydan. Susie&#x27;s father was U.S. Senator John Fairfield Dryden. John Kuser later became a New Jersey Republican councilman, assemblyman, and state senator. They also lived in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

Brooke described her tumultuous first marriage as the &quot;worst years of [her] life&quot;, which was punctuated by her husband&#x27;s alleged physical abuse, alcoholism and adultery. According to Frances Kiernan&#x27;s 2007 biography of Astor, when Brooke was six months pregnant with the couple&#x27;s only child, her husband broke her jaw during a marital fight. &quot;I learned about terrible manners from the family of my first husband,&quot; she told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;They didn&#x27;t know how to treat people&quot;. A year after the marriage, according to a published account of the divorce proceedings, John &quot;began to embarrass her in social activities&quot; and &quot;told her that he no longer loved her and that their marriage was a failure&quot;.

Brooke and John had one son, Anthony Dryden &quot;Tony&quot; Kuser, May 30, 1924. She filed for divorce February 15, 1930, in Reno, Nevada. It was finalized later that year.

===Charles Henry Marshall===
Her second husband, whom she married in 1932, was Charles Henry &quot;Buddy&quot; Marshall (1891–1952), the only son of Charles Henry Marshall. Buddy was the senior partner of the investment firm Butler, Herrick &amp; Marshall, a brother-in-law of the mercantile heir Marshall Field III, and a descendant of James Lenox, the founder of the Lenox Library.

Astor later wrote that the marriage was &quot;a great love match.&quot;

She had two stepchildren by the marriage, Peter Marshall and Helen Huntington Marshall. Helen&#x27;s first marriage was to composer Ernest Schelling and her second to cellist János Scholz.

In 1942, Brooke&#x27;s then-18-year-old son Tony changed his name to Anthony Dryden Marshall out of admiration for his stepfather. Buddy&#x27;s financial fortunes turned in the mid-1940s when Brooke went to work as a features editor at &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine for eight years. She also briefly worked for Ruby Ross Wood, a prominent New York interior decorator who, with her associate Billy Baldwin, decorated the Marshalls&#x27; apartment at 1 Gracie Square in New York City.

===William Vincent Astor===
In October 1953, 11 months after Charles Marshall&#x27;s death, she married her third and final husband, William Vincent Astor, the chairman of the board of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine and the last rich American member of the famous Astor family. Vincent was the son of &quot;RMS Titanic&quot; victim John Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Astor IV and socialite Ava Lowle Willing. He had been married and divorced twice before, had no children and was known to have a difficult personality.

&quot;He had a dreadful childhood and as a result had moments of deep melancholy,&quot; Brooke recalled. &quot;But I think I made him happy. That&#x27;s what I set out to do. I&#x27;d literally dance with the dogs, sing and play the piano, and I would make him laugh, something no one had ever done before. Because of his money, Vincent was very suspicious of people. That&#x27;s what I tried to cure him of.&quot;

Not wanting to die alone, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife Mary Benedict &quot;Minnie&quot; Cushing only after she had found him a replacement spouse. Minnie had first suggested Janet Newbold Rhinelander-Stewart who turned down Astor&#x27;s proposal with startling candor stating &quot;I don&#x27;t even like you.&quot; Minnie then suggested the recently widowed Brooke. Few people believed that the Astor-Marshall union was anything more than a financial transaction. According to Brooke&#x27;s friend Louis Auchincloss &quot;she married Vincent for the money,&quot; adding &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t respect her if she hadn&#x27;t. Only a twisted person would have married him for love.&quot;

During her brief marriage to Vincent, whom she called &quot;Captain,&quot; Brooke participated in his real-estate and hotel empire and his philanthropic endeavors. Between 1954 and 1958, she redecorated one of his properties, the Hotel St. Regis, which had been built by his father. Vincent died leaving all his money to Brooke. His younger half-brother socialite John Jacob &quot;Jakey&quot; Astor VI was left with nothing since Vincent&#x27;s hatred for Jakey&#x27;s mother Madeleine (Jack&#x27;s second wife and widow) led him to believe he was not even a biological Astor. Vincent had nothing but contempt for him. Jakey felt cheated and resentfully stated Vincent &quot;had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money.&quot; He was certain that Vincent was &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; when signing his last will in June 1958 due to alcoholism, though Brooke insisted otherwise. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke would often bring him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000. The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke. Before Vincent&#x27;s death, Brooke once privately admitted to her daughter-in-law Elizabeth Cynthia &quot;Liz&quot; Cryan: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I can stand being married to him anymore. I don&#x27;t think I can take it. He never wants to go anywhere — he&#x27;s so antisocial.&quot;

Though she received several proposals after Astor&#x27;s death, she chose not to remarry. In a 1980 interview, she stated: &quot;I&#x27;d have to marry a man of a suitable age and somebody who was a somebody and that&#x27;s not easy. Frankly, I think I&#x27;m unmarriageable now.&quot; She also said, &quot;I&#x27;m too used to having things my way. But I still enjoy a flirt now and then.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Though she was appointed a member of the board of the Astor Foundation soon after her marriage, upon Vincent Astor&#x27;s death in 1959, she took charge of all the philanthropies to which he left his fortune. She served as a Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and chaired the Visiting Committee of the Metropolitan&#x27;s Department of Far Eastern Art; she is credited with the idea for a Chinese garden courtyard, the Astor Court, in the Metropolitan. In addition, Astor served as a member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 100th Anniversary Committee and hosted the Metropolitan&#x27;s Centennial Ball. She was also a benefactress to the New York Zoological Society for which Astor the baby Asian elephant was named in her honor.

Despite liquidating the Vincent Astor Foundation in 1997, she continued to be active in charities and in New York&#x27;s social life. The New York Public Library was always one of Astor&#x27;s favorite charities as was The Animal Medical Center. In 1988 she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. As a result of her charity work, Astor was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998. Her life&#x27;s motto summed up her prodigious generosity: &quot;Money is like manure; it&#x27;s not worth a thing unless it&#x27;s spread around.&quot;

Among numerous other organizations, she was involved with Lighthouse for the Blind, the Maternity Center Association, the Astor Home for emotionally disturbed children, the International Rescue Committee, the Fresh Air Fund, and the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Board of the Society of New York Hospital.

==Elder abuse controversy==

The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; ran a cover story on July 26, 2006, describing the family feud between Brooke&#x27;s son Anthony Marshall and her grandson Philip Cryan Marshall regarding Brooke&#x27;s welfare. The story detailed how her grandson, a historic preservationist and professor at Roger Williams University, had filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of his father as the socialite&#x27;s guardian and the appointment of Annette de la Renta, the wife of designer Oscar de la Renta, instead.

According to accounts published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;, Astor was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and suffered from anemia, among other ailments. The lawsuit alleged that Marshall had not provided for his elderly mother and instead had allowed her to live in squalor and reduced necessary medication and doctor&#x27;s visits while enriching himself with income from her estate. Philip Marshall further charged that his father sold his grandmother&#x27;s favorite Childe Hassam painting in 2002 without her knowledge and with no record as to the whereabouts of the funds received from the sale. In addition to Annette de la Renta, Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller provided affidavits supporting Philip Marshall&#x27;s requests for a change in guardianship.

The day the story appeared, New York Supreme Court Justice John Stackhouse sealed the documents pertaining to the lawsuit and granted an order appointing Annette de la Renta guardian and JPMorgan Chase to be in charge of Brooke&#x27;s finances. Several news organizations including the Associated Press and &quot;The New York Times&quot; sued to have the records of the Astor case unsealed in the public interest; their request was granted September 1, 2006. Astor was moved to Lenox Hill Hospital where an unidentified nurse called her appearance &quot;deplorable&quot; according to the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Brooke&#x27;s son Tony unsuccessfully attempted to have his mother transferred to another hospital.

Brooke was released from Lenox Hill Hospital July 29, 2006, and moved to Holly Hill, her estate in the village of Briarcliff Manor, New York, where she died August 13, 2007.

Meryl Gordon&#x27;s book &quot;Mrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach&quot; (2008) makes use of diaries kept by the nurses who cared for Brooke during the last years of her life. The diaries were compiled over the four years Astor received care and detail the elder abuse that she reportedly received from her son.

Philip C. Marshall was a tenured professor and director of historic preservation at Roger Williams University until 2017 when he left to dedicate his efforts full-time to elder justice as the founder of Beyond Brooke.

==Estate tampering==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on August 1, 2006, that Anthony Marshall was accused by Alice Perdue, an employee in his mother&#x27;s business office, of diverting nearly $1 million from his ailing mother&#x27;s personal checking accounts into theatrical productions. Marshall through a spokesman said that his mother knew of the investments and approved of them. Perdue countered that Marshall had advised her never to send to his mother any documents of a financial nature because &quot;she didn&#x27;t understand it.&quot;

The claims made by Philip Marshall regarding his father&#x27;s handling of the estate prompted interest in the matter. The New York District Attorney indicted Anthony Marshall and attorney Francis X. Morrissey Jr. in November 2007. The charges stemmed from the district attorney&#x27;s office and subsequent grand jury investigation into the mishandling of Astor&#x27;s money and a questionable signature on the third amendment to her 2002 will which was made in March 2004. That amendment called for Astor&#x27;s real estate to be sold and the proceeds added to her residuary estate. An earlier amendment, also made in 2004, which designated Marshall as the executor of his mother&#x27;s estate and left him the entirety of the residuary estate, was also under investigation.

The trial of Anthony Marshall and Morrissey started in March 2009 with jury selection. In October 2009, after deliberations that stretched over 12 days and were reportedly marked by bitter disagreements that left one female juror claiming to feel personally threatened by another juror, the jury convicted Anthony Marshall (then age 85) of 14 of the 16 counts against him, including one of two charges of grand larceny, the most serious charge, for giving himself a retroactive $1 million payment for assisting with his mother&#x27;s finances. The jury acquitted Anthony Marshall on the other first-degree larceny count (for his sale for $10 million of a painting by Childe Hassam owned by Astor, in which Marshall took a $2 million commission), and also acquitted him of falsifying business records. The same jury convicted Morrissey of forgery, conspiracy, and fraud.

In December 2009, Marshall and Morrisey were both sentenced to 1–3 years in prison. Philip C. Marshall, Astor&#x27;s grandson, said that now that his father has been convicted in the Brooke Astor will case, he expects the will to be contested by various charities. Anthony Marshall died in 2014.

On November 30, 2011, Sotheby&#x27;s announced plans for an April 19, 2012, auction of jewelry as well as fine and decorative arts from her Park Avenue apartment and Holly Hill, her Westchester estate.

== Death and interment ==
Brooke died August 13, 2007, aged 105 from pneumonia at her home in Briarcliff Manor, New York. A funeral service was held at Saint Thomas Church (Manhattan) on August 17. Among the guests were Henry Kissinger, Oscar de la Renta, Whoopi Goldberg, Jessye Norman and Michael Bloomberg. She is interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery next to Vincent. The epitaph on her gravestone chosen by her reads: &quot;I had a wonderful life.&quot;

One of Astor&#x27;s death notices in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a paid notice from The Rockefeller University, ended with these lines:

Brooke Astor is portrayed as the heroine Jane Merle in the romantic comedy &quot;Night and Silence: Who is Here?&quot; by British novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson.

In an episode of the American comedy &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Liz Lemon compliments Angie Jordan&#x27;s ring, which Lemon states is &quot;ghetto fabulous&quot;. Jordan retorts, &quot;This belonged to Brooke Astor&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, Blair Waldorf asks, &quot;when did little Jenny Humphrey become the next Brooke Astor?&quot;

Astor&#x27;s biography was adapted into the musical &quot;Brooke Astor&#x27;s Last Affair&quot;, with book and lyrics by Rachael Migler and music by Eric Grunin. The play premiered at the 2019 Chicago Musical Theatre Festival.

<doc id="326595" wikidata="Q333703" url="?curid=326595" title="Fakhr al-Din al-Razi">
<text>Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī () or Fakhruddin Razi () (1149 or 1150 – 1209), often known by the sobriquet Sultan of the Theologians, was an influential Iranian and Muslim polymath, scientist and one of the pioneers of inductive logic. He wrote various works in the fields of medicine, chemistry, physics, astronomy, cosmology, literature, theology, ontology, philosophy, history and jurisprudence. He was one of the earliest proponents and skeptics that came up with the concept of multiverse, and compared it with the astronomical teachings of Quran. A rejector of the geocentric model and the Aristotelian notions of a single universe revolving around a single world, al-Razi argued about the existence of the outer space beyond the known world.

Al-Razi was born in Ray, Iran, and died in Herat, Afghanistan. He left a very rich corpus of philosophical and theological works that reveals influence from the works of Avicenna, Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī and al-Ghazali. 
Two of his works titled &quot;Mabāhith al-mashriqiyya fī &#x27;ilm al-ilāhiyyāt wa-&#x27;l-tabi&#x27;iyyāt&quot; المباحث المشرقية في علم الإلهيات و الطبيعيات (&quot;Eastern Studies in Metaphysics and Physics&quot;) and &quot;al-Matālib al-&#x27;Aliya&quot; المطالب العالية (&quot;The Higher Issues&quot;) are usually regarded as his most important philosophical works.

== Biography ==

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, whose full name was &quot;Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar ibn al-Ḥusayn&quot; (), was born in 1149 or 1150 CE (543 or 544 AH) in Ray (close to modern Tehran), whence his  al-Razi. According to Ibn al-Shaʿʿār al-Mawṣilī (died 1256), one of al-Razi&#x27;s earliest biographers, his great-grandfather had been a rich merchant in Mecca. Either his great-grandfather or his grandfather migrated from Mecca to Tabaristan (a mountainous region located on the Caspian coast of northern Iran) in the 11th century, and some time after that the family settled in Ray. Having been born into a family of Meccan origin, al-Razi claimed descent from the first caliph Abu Bakr (), and was known by medieval biographers as al-Qurashī (a member of the Quraysh, the tribe of the prophet Muhammad to which also Abu Bakr belonged). However, it is not clear from which precise lines of descent al-Razi envisioned his purported ties with Abu Bakr to result, and the poet Ibn ʿUnayn (died 1233) actually praised him as a descendant of the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (died 644).

Fakhr al-Din first studied with his father, Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn al-Makkī, himself a scholar of some repute whose &quot;magnum opus&quot; in kalam has recently been rediscovered in part, and later at Merv and Maragheh, where he was one of the pupils of Majd al-Din al-Jili, who in turn had been a disciple of al-Ghazali. He was a leading proponent of the Ash&#x27;ari school of theology.

His commentary on the Quran was the most-varied and many-sided of all extant works of the kind, comprising most of the material of importance that had previously appeared. He devoted himself to a wide range of studies and is said to have expended a large fortune on experiments in alchemy. He taught at Ray (Central Iran) and Ghazni (eastern Afghanistan), and became head of the university founded by Mohammed ibn Tukush at Herat (western Afghanistan).

In his later years, he also showed interest in mysticism, though this never formed a significant part of his thought. He died in Herat (Afghanistan) in 1209 (606 AH), where his tomb is still venerated today. Many believe he was poisoned by the Karrāmīyah.

==&quot;The Great Commentary&quot;==

One of Imam Razi&#x27;s outstanding achievements was his unique interpretive work on the Quran called &quot;Mafātiḥ al-Ghayb&quot; (&quot;Keys to the Unseen&quot;) and later nicknamed &quot;Tafsīr al-Kabīr&quot; (&quot;The Great Commentary&quot;), one reason being that it was 32 volumes in length. This work contains much of philosophical interest. One of his &quot;major concerns was the self-sufficiency of the intellect.&quot; His &quot;acknowledgment of the primacy of the Qur&#x27;an grew with his years.&quot; Al-Razi&#x27;s rationalism undoubtedly &quot;holds an important place in the debate in the Islamic tradition on the harmonization of reason and revelation.&quot;

==Development of Kalam==
Al-Razi&#x27;s development of Kalam (Islamic scholastic theology) led to the evolution and flourishing of theology among Muslims. Razi had experienced different periods in his thinking, affected by the Ash&#x27;ari school of thought and later by al-Ghazali. Al-Razi tried to make use of elements of Muʿtazila and &quot;Falsafah&quot;, and although he had some criticisms on ibn Sina, Razi was greatly affected by him. The most important instance showing the synthesis of Razi&#x27;s thought may be the problem of the eternity of the world and its relation to God. He tried to reorganize the arguments of theologians and philosophers on this subject, collected and critically examined the arguments of both sides. He considered, for the most part, the philosophers&#x27; argument for the world&#x27;s eternity stronger than the theologians&#x27; position of putting emphasis on the temporal nature of the world. According to Tony Street, we should not see in Razi&#x27;s theoretical life a journey from a young dialectician to a religious condition. It seems that he adopted different thoughts of diverse schools, such as those of Mutazilite and Asharite, in his exegesis, &quot;The Great Commentary&quot;.

== Hypothetical concept of multiple universes ==
Al-Razi, in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his &quot;Matalib al-&#x27;Aliya&quot;, criticizes the idea of the geocentric model within the universe and &quot;explores the notion of the existence of a multiverse in the context of his commentary&quot; on the Quranic verse, &quot;All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds.&quot; He raises the question of whether the term &quot;worlds&quot; in this verse refers to &quot;multiple worlds within this single universe or cosmos, or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe.&quot;

Al-Razi states:

Al-Razi rejected the Aristotelian and Avicennian notions of a single universe revolving around a single world. He describes their main arguments against the existence of multiple worlds or universes, pointing out their weaknesses and refuting them. This rejection arose from his affirmation of atomism, as advocated by the Ash&#x27;ari school of Islamic theology, which entails the existence of vacant space in which the atoms move, combine and separate . He discussed more on the issue of the void – the empty spaces between stars and constellations in the universe, that contain few or no stars – in greater detail in volume 5 of the &quot;Matalib&quot;. He argued that there exists an infinite outer space beyond the known world, and that God has the power to fill the vacuum with an infinite number of universes.

==List of works==
Al-Razi had written over a hundred works on a wide variety of subjects. His major works include:
* &quot;Tafsir al-Kabir&quot; (&quot;The Great Commentary&quot;) (also known as Mafatih al-Ghayb)

<doc id="326606" wikidata="Q870607" url="?curid=326606" title="William Backhouse Astor Sr.">
<text>William Backhouse Astor Sr. (September 19, 1792 – November 24, 1875) was an American business magnate who inherited most of his father John Jacob Astor&#x27;s fortune. He worked as a partner in his father&#x27;s successful export business. His massive investment in Manhattan real estate enabled major donations to the Astor Library in the East Village, which became the New York Public Library.

==Early life==
William was born in New York City on September 19, 1792, and named after William Backhouse, a friend of his father who was a New York merchant. He was a son of fur-trader John Jacob Astor (1763–1848) and Sarah Cox Todd (1761–1834). His seven siblings were Magdalena (1788–1832), Sarah (1790–1790), John Jr. (1791–1869), Dorothea (1795–1874), Henry (1797–1799), Eliza (1801–1838), and an unnamed brother who died shortly after his November 13, 1802, birth.

He attended local public schools. His spare hours and vacations were employed in assisting his father in the store. Official records show that he matriculated with the class of 1811 of Columbia College, but did not graduate from the institution. At Columbia, he was a member of the Peithologian Society and Philolexian Society, both undergraduate literary societies.

Instead, at age sixteen, he was sent to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he joined the German Student Corps &quot;Curonia&quot; of the Baltic German students; later he moved to the University of Heidelberg. He chose as his tutor a student, afterward known as the Chevalier Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen, with whom he also traveled.

==Career==
In 1815, he returned to the United States and entered partnership with his father, who changed the name of his firm to John Jacob Astor &amp; Son and engaged in the China trade. William&#x27;s elder brother John Jacob Astor Jr. was sickly and mentally unstable, and had no part in the business. He worked there until his father&#x27;s death. One source argued that his role in the company was never anything more than as &quot;an industrious and faithful head clerk&quot;, despite his official title of head of the firm&#x27;s chief subsidiary, the American Fur Company, in its last several years of its ownership by Astor &amp; Son.

Although William&#x27;s fortunes grew with his father&#x27;s company, he became a truly wealthy man when he inherited the estate, worth around $500,000 (equivalent to roughly $507 million in 2024), of his childless uncle Henry Astor I, who died in 1833. When John Jacob Astor Sr. died in 1848, William became the richest man in America.

===Real estate===
Following the example of his father, he invested in real estate, principally situated below Central Park, between 4th and 7th Avenues, which rapidly increased in value. For about 13 years prior to 1873 he was largely engaged in building until much of his hitherto unoccupied land was covered by houses. He was said to own in 1867 as many as 720 houses, and he was also heavily interested in railroad, coal, and insurance companies. His management of the family real estate holdings succeeded in multiplying their value, and he left an estate worth close to $50 million. His house at Barrytown, New York, known as Rokeby, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

During the American Civil War he successfully brought a case against the income tax imposed by the United States government, which was ruled unconstitutional.

===Philanthropy===
He added to the bequest of his father for the Astor Library the sum of $250,000, of which he paid during his lifetime $201,000 in land, books, and money. The edifice was completed under his directions in May, 1853. In 1855 he presented to the trustees the adjoining lot, and erected thereon a similar structure, which was completed in 1859. He next gave $50,000 for the purchase of books. He gave much patient attention for many years to the administration of the library.

He gave $50,000 to St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, and in his will he left $200,000 to the Astor Library, in addition to $49,000, the unexpended balance of his earlier donation. The gifts and bequests of William Backhouse Astor Sr. to the Astor Library amounted altogether to about $550,000. In 1879, William&#x27;s eldest son John Jacob Astor III presented three lots adjoining the library building, and erected on them a third structure similar to the others, and added a story to the central building. His outlay, exclusive of land, was about $250,000, making the entire gift of the Astor family more than $1,000,000. In 1852–53, he built the St. Margaret&#x27;s Home at Red Hook, New York, and supported it until his death in 1875.

==Personal life==

On May 20, 1818, William married Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong (1800–1872), the daughter of Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida (née Livingston) Armstrong and sister of Horatio Gates Armstrong. Her mother, a member of the prominent Livingston family, was the youngest child of Judge Robert Livingston and Margaret (née Beekman) Livingston as well as the sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston and Secretary of State Edward Livingston. Her father, John Armstrong Jr. was President James Madison&#x27;s second Secretary of War. Together, William and Margaret had seven children:

# Emily Astor (1819–1841), who married Samuel Cutler &quot;Sam&quot; Ward (1814–1884), a financier/lobbyist/author, on January 5, 1838, and had two children.
# John Jacob Astor III (1822–1890), who married Charlotte Augusta Matilda Gibbes (1825–1887) on December 9, 1846, and had one son.
# Mary Alida Astor (1823–1881), who married John Carey (1821–1881) on April 16, 1850, and had three children.
# Laura Eugenia Astor (1824–1902), who married Franklin Hughes Delano (1813–1893), on September 17, 1844 (no issue).
# William Backhouse Astor Jr. (1829–1892), who married socialite Caroline Webster &quot;Lina&quot; Schermerhorn (1830–1908) on September 20, 1853, and had five children.
# Henry Astor III (1830–1918), who married Malvina Dinehart (1844–1918) in 1871 after which he was estranged from his family (no issue).
# Sarah Todd Astor (1832–1832), who died in infancy.

As a wedding gift, Astor gave Franklin and Laura Delano the southernmost 100 acres of Rokeby estate. The estate came to be known as &quot;Steen Valetje&quot; (which means &quot;little stone valley&quot; in Dutch).

Margaret Astor died on February 15, 1872, William Astor survived his wife by three years dying on November 24, 1875, in his townhouse at Lafayette Place in New York City. He was buried next to his wife in the Astor vault at Trinity Church Cemetery, designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, in New York City. In 1866 he conveyed the adjoining 142 acres of Rokeby to his son, Henry. Henry Astor built a brick dwelling on this land, but in 1873 conveyed the property to Laura.

Astor&#x27;s local newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot; eulogised, Mr. William B. Astor. an illness of four days ends an honored and successful life the public events in Mr. Astor&#x27;s career a ripe scholar and philanthropic man. Mr William B. Astor, after an illness of only a few days, died at his residence in this City yesterday at 9:30 A.M., aged eighty three years. Mr. Astor was in his usual good health, except for a slight cold, until Saturday of last week. On that morning his cold began to trouble him and occasioned a severe cough.

<doc id="326609" wikidata="Q1089791" url="?curid=326609" title="Church of Euthanasia">
<text>The Church of Euthanasia (CoE) is a religion and antinatalist activist organization founded by Chris Korda and Robert Kimberk (Pastor Kim) in Boston, Massachusetts in 1992. As stated on its website, it is &quot;a non-profit educational foundation devoted to restoring balance between Humans and the remaining species on Earth.&quot; Its members affirm that this can only turn into a reality by a massive voluntary population reduction, which will depend on a leap in human consciousness to species-awareness. According to Korda, it is likely that this church is the world&#x27;s only anti-human religion.

Its most popular slogan is &quot;Save the Planet, Kill Yourself&quot;, and its founding ideology is set in one commandment, &quot;Thou Shalt not Procreate&quot;, and four main pillars: suicide (&quot;optional but encouraged&quot;), abortion (&quot;may be required to avoid procreation&quot;), cannibalism (&quot;mandatory if you insist on eating flesh&quot; but only if someone is already dead), and sodomy (&quot;any sexual act not intended for procreation&quot;). The church stresses population reduction by voluntary means only, and rejects murder and eugenics as a means of achieving it.

The church promotes its environmental views. They also utilize sermons, art performances, public demonstrations, culture jamming, music, publicity stunts, and direct action to promote their idea of Earth&#x27;s unsustainable population. They consider their methods similar to those of the Dadaist movement, finding the modern world so absurd that the means needed to spread their message to the public must be absurd themselves. The Church of Euthanasia is also notorious for its conflicts with anti-abortion Christian activists. The group&#x27;s slogans include &quot;Save the Planet, Kill Yourself&quot;, &quot;Six Billion Humans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, and &quot;Eat a Queer Fetus for Jesus&quot;.

In its heyday the CoE claimed hundreds of official members and thousands of subscribers. Since 2015, the group has become idle but their website remains online as an archive. Some founders of the group, including Korda, continue their antinatalist activism.

== History ==
The church gained early attention in 1995 because of its affiliation with paranoia.com, which hosted many sites that were controversial or skirted illegality. Members later appeared on an episode of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; titled &quot;I Want to Join a Suicide Cult&quot;.

Following the September 11 attacks, the church posted on its website a four-minute music video titled &quot;I Like to Watch&quot;, combining hardcore pornography with footage of the attacks and the collapse of the World Trade Center. Over the video played an electronic soundtrack recorded by Korda with the lyrics, &quot;People dive into the street / While I play with my meat&quot; and &quot;My steel melted and my tower&#x27;s coming down.&quot; It also showed a man orgasming and then cleaning himself with an American flag. Korda described the project as reflecting her &quot;contempt for and frustration with the profound ugliness of the modern industrial world.&quot;

The church&#x27;s instructions on &quot;how to kill yourself&quot; by asphyxiation with helium were removed from its website in 2003 after a 52-year-old woman used them and died by suicide in St. Louis County, Missouri, resulting in legal threats against the organization.

<doc id="326627" wikidata="Q216841" url="?curid=326627" title="History of Myanmar">
<text>The history of Myanmar (also known as Burma; ) covers the period from the time of first-known human settlements 13,000 years ago to the present day. The earliest inhabitants of recorded history were a Tibeto-Burman-speaking people who established the Pyu city-states ranged as far south as Pyay and adopted Theravada Buddhism.

Another group, the Bamar people, entered the upper Irrawaddy valley in the early 9th century. They went on to establish the Pagan Kingdom (1044–1297), the first-ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. The Burmese language and culture slowly came to replace Pyu norms during this period. After the First Mongol invasion of Burma in 1287, several small kingdoms, of which the Kingdom of Ava, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, the Kingdom of Mrauk U and the Shan States were principal powers, came to dominate the landscape, replete with ever-shifting alliances and constant wars. From this time, the history of this region has been characterised by geopolitical struggles between the Bamar ethnic group, and the multitude of smaller ethnic groups surrounding them.

In the second half of the 16th century, the Toungoo dynasty (1510–1752) reunified the country, and founded the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a brief period. Later Taungoo kings instituted several key administrative and economic reforms that gave rise to a smaller, more peaceful and prosperous kingdom in the 17th and early 18th centuries. In the second half of the 18th century, the Konbaung dynasty (1752–1885) restored the kingdom, and continued the Taungoo reforms that increased central rule in peripheral regions and produced one of the most literate states in Asia. The dynasty also went to war with all its neighbors. The Anglo-Burmese wars (1824–85) eventually led to British colonial rule.

British rule brought several enduring social, economic, cultural and administrative changes that completely transformed the once-agrarian society. British rule highlighted out-group differences among the country&#x27;s myriad ethnic groups. Since independence in 1948, the country has been in one of the longest running civil wars involving insurgent groups representing political and ethnic minority groups and successive central governments. The country was under military rule under various guises from 1962 to 2010 and again from 2021–present, and in the seemingly cyclical process has become one of the least developed nations in the world.

==Early history (to the 9th century)==
===Prehistory===

The earliest archaeological evidence suggests that cultures existed in Burma as early as 11,000 BCE. Most indications of early settlement have been found in the central dry zone, where scattered sites appear in close proximity to the Irrawaddy River. The &quot;Anyathian&quot;, Burma&#x27;s Stone Age, existed at a time thought to parallel the lower and middle Paleolithic in Europe. The Neolithic or New Stone Age, when plants and animals were first domesticated and polished stone tools appeared, is evidenced in Burma by three caves located near Taunggyi at the edge of the Shan plateau that are dated to 10000 to 6000 BC.

About 1500 BCE, people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating chickens and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. By 500 BCE, iron-working settlements emerged in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Bronze-decorated coffins and burial sites filled with earthenware remains have been excavated. Archaeological evidence at Samon Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice growing settlements that traded with China between 500 BC and 200 CE. During the Iron Age, archaeological evidence also out of Samon Valley reveals changes in infant burial practices that were greatly influenced by India. These changes include burying infants in jars whose size depicts their family status.

===Pyu city-states===
The Pyu entered the Irrawaddy valley from present-day Yunnan, c. 2nd century BCE, and went on to found city-states throughout the Irrawaddy valley. The original home of the Pyu is reconstructed to be Qinghai Lake in present-day Qinghai and Gansu. The Pyu were the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant. During this period, Burma was part of an overland trade route from China to India. Trade with India brought Buddhism from India By the 4th century, many in the Irrawaddy valley had converted to Buddhism. Of the many city-states, the largest and most important was the Sri Ksetra Kingdom southeast of modern Pyay, also thought to once be the capital city. In March 638, the Pyu of Sri Ksetra launched a new calendar that later became the Burmese calendar.

Eighth-century Chinese records identify 18 Pyu states throughout the Irrawaddy valley, and describe the Pyu as a humane and peaceful people to whom war was virtually unknown and who wore silk cotton instead of actual silk so that they would not have to kill silkworms. The Chinese records also report that the Pyu knew how to make astronomical calculations, and that many Pyu boys entered the monastic life at seven to the age of 20.

It was a long-lasting civilisation that lasted nearly a millennium to the early 9th century until a new group of &quot;swift horsemen&quot; from the north, the Bamars, entered the upper Irrawaddy valley. In the early 9th century, the Pyu city-states of Upper Burma came under constant attacks by Nanzhao (in modern Yunnan). In 832, the Nanzhao sacked Halingyi, which had overtaken Prome as the chief Pyu city-state and informal capital. Archaeologists interpret early Chinese texts detailing the plundering of Halingyi in 832 to detail the capturing of 3000 Pyu prisoners, later becoming Nanzhao slaves at Kunming.

While Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma until the advent of the Pagan Empire in the mid 11th century, the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding Burman kingdom of Pagan in the next four centuries. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed Bamar ethnicity. The histories/legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Bamars.

===Mon kingdoms===
According to the colonial era scholarship, as early as the 6th century, another people called the Mon began to enter the present-day Lower Burma from the Mon kingdoms of Haribhunjaya and Dvaravati in modern-day Thailand. By the mid 9th century, the Mon had founded at least two small kingdoms (or large city-states) centred around Bago and Thaton. The earliest external reference to a Mon kingdom in Lower Burma was in 844–848 by Arab geographers. But recent research shows that there is no evidence (archaeological or otherwise) to support colonial period conjectures that a Mon-speaking polity existed in Lower Burma until the late 13th century, and the first recorded claim that the kingdom of Thaton existed came only in 1479.

==Bagan dynasty (849–1297)==
===Early Bagan===

The Burmans who had come down with the early 9th Nanzhao raids of the Pyu states remained in Upper Burma. (Trickles of Burman migrations into the upper Irrawaddy valley might have begun as early as the 7th century.) In the mid-to-late 9th century, Pagan was founded as a fortified settlement along a strategic location on the Irrawaddy near the confluence of the Irrawaddy and its main tributary the Chindwin River.

It may have been designed to help the Nanzhao pacify the surrounding countryside. Over the next two hundred years, the small principality gradually grew to include its immediate surrounding areas— to about 200 miles north to south and 80 miles from east to west by Anawrahta&#x27;s accession in 1044.

===Pagan Empire (1044–1297)===
Over the next 30 years, Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, unifying for the first time the regions that would later constitute the modern-day Burma. Anawrahta&#x27;s successors by the late 12th century had extended their influence farther south into the upper Malay Peninsula, at least to the Salween River in the east, below the current China border in the farther north, and to the west, northern Arakan and the Chin Hills. The Burmese Chronicles claim Pagan&#x27;s suzerainty over the entire Chao Phraya Valley, and the Thai chronicles include the lower Malay Peninsula down to the Strait of Malacca to Pagan&#x27;s realm.

By the early 12th century, Pagan had emerged as a major power alongside the Khmer Empire in Southeast Asia, recognised by Song China and the Chola dynasty of India. Well into the mid-13th century, most of mainland Southeast Asia was under some degree of control of either the Pagan Empire or the Khmer Empire.

Anawrahta also implemented a series of key social, religious and economic reforms that would have a lasting impact in Burmese history. His social and religious reforms later developed into the modern-day culture of Myanmar. The most important development was the introduction of Theravada Buddhism to Upper Burma after Pagan&#x27;s conquest of the Thaton Kingdom in 1057. Supported by royal patronage, the Buddhist school gradually spread to the village level in the next three centuries although Vajrayana Buddhist, Mahayana, Hindu, and animism remained heavily entrenched at all social strata.

Pagan&#x27;s economy was primarily based on the Kyaukse agricultural basin northeast of the capital, and Minbu, south of Bagan, where the Bamars had built a large number of new weirs and diversionary canals. It also benefited from external trade through its coastal ports. The wealth of the kingdom was devoted to building over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone between 11th and 13th centuries (of which 3000 remain to the present day). The wealthy donated tax-free land to religious authorities.

The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu and Pali norms by the late 12th century. By then, the Bamar leadership of the kingdom was unquestioned. The Pyu had largely assumed the Bamar ethnicity in Upper Burma. The Burmese language, once an alien tongue, was now the lingua franca of the kingdom.

The kingdom went into decline in the 13th century as the continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth—by the 1280s, two-thirds of Upper Burma&#x27;s cultivable land had been alienated to the religion—affected the crown&#x27;s ability to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen. This ushered in a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges by Mons, Mongols and Shans.

Beginning in the early 13th century, the Shan began to encircle the Pagan Empire from the north and the east. The Mongols, who had conquered Yunnan, the former homeland of the Bamar, in 1253, began their invasion in 1277 in response to an embassy crisis, and in 1287 sacked Pagan, ending the Pagan Kingdom&#x27;s 250-year rule of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery when the Pagan king of that time abandoned his palace on the news of the Mongol march. Pagan&#x27;s rule of central Burma came to an end ten years later in 1297 when it was toppled by the Myinsaing Kingdom of Shan rulers.

==Small kingdoms==
After the fall of Pagan, the Mongols left the searing Irrawaddy valley but the Pagan Kingdom was irreparably broken up into several small kingdoms. By the mid-14th century, the country had become organised along four major power centres: Upper Burma, Lower Burma, Shan States and Arakan. Many of the power centres were themselves made up of (often loosely held) minor kingdoms or princely states. This era was marked by a series of wars and switching alliances. Smaller kingdoms played a precarious game of paying allegiance to more powerful states, sometimes simultaneously.

===Ava (1364–1555)===

Founded in 1364, Kingdom of Ava (Inwa) was the successor state to earlier, even smaller kingdoms based in central Burma: Taungoo (1287–1318), Myinsaing–Pinya Kingdom (1297–1364), and Sagaing Kingdom (1315–64). In its first years of existence, Ava, which viewed itself as the rightful successor to the Pagan Kingdom, tried to reassemble the former empire. While it was able to pull the Taungoo-ruled kingdom and peripheral Shan states (Kalay, Mohnyin, Mogaung, Hsipaw) into its fold at the peak of its power, it failed to reconquer the rest.

The Forty Years&#x27; War (1385–1424) with Hanthawaddy left Ava exhausted, and its power plateaued. Its kings regularly faced rebellions in its vassal regions but were able to put them down until the 1480s. In the late 15th century, the Prome Kingdom and its Shan States successfully broke away, and in the early 16th century, Ava itself came under attacks from its former vassals. In 1510, Taungoo also broke away. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States led by Mohnyin captured Ava. The Confederation&#x27;s rule of Upper Burma, though lasted until 1555, was marred by internal fighting between Mohnyin and Thibaw houses. The kingdom was toppled by Taungoo forces in 1555.

The Burmese language and culture came into its own between the last period of the Pagan Kingdom (Old Burmese starts in the XII° century) and the Ava period.

===Hanthawaddy Pegu (1287–1539, 1550–52)===

The Mon- kingdom was founded as Ramannadesa right after Pagan&#x27;s collapse in 1297. In the beginning, the Lower-Burma-based kingdom was a loose federation of regional power centre in the Mottama, the Pegu and the Irrawaddy Delta. The energetic reign of Razadarit (1384–1421) cemented the kingdom&#x27;s existence. Razadarit firmly unified the three Mon-speaking regions together, and successfully held off Ava in the Forty Years&#x27; War (1385–1424).

After the war, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age whereas its rival Ava gradually went into decline. From the 1420s to the 1530s, Hanthawaddy was the most powerful and prosperous kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms. Under a string of especially gifted monarchs, the kingdom enjoyed a long golden age, profiting from foreign commerce. The kingdom, with a flourishing the Mon language and culture, became a Centre of commerce and Theravada Buddhism.

Due to the inexperience of its last ruler, the powerful kingdom was conquered by the upstart Taungoo dynasty in 1539. The kingdom was briefly revived between 1550 and 1552. It effectively controlled only Pegu and was crushed by Taungoo in 1552.

===Shan States (1287–1563)===

The Shans, ethnic Tai peoples who came down with the Mongols, stayed and quickly came to dominate much of northern to eastern arc of Burma, from northwestern Sagaing Division to Kachin Hills to the present day Shan Hills.

The most powerful Shan states were Mohnyin and Mogaung in present-day Kachin State, followed by Hsenwi (Theinni) (split up in a northern and a southern state in 1988), Thsipaw (Thibaw) and Momeik in present-day northern Shan State.

Minor states included Kalay, Bhamo (Wanmaw or Manmaw), Hkamti Long (Kantigyi), Hopong (Hopon), Hsahtung (Thaton), Hsamönghkam (Thamaingkan), Hsawnghsup (Thaungdut), Hsihkip (Thigyit), Hsumhsai (Hsum Hsai), Kehsi Mangam (Kyithi Bansan), Kengcheng (Kyaingchaing), Kenghkam (Kyaingkan), Kenglön (Kyainglon), Kengtawng, Kengtung (Kyaington), Kokang (Kho Kan), Kyawkku Hsiwan (Kyaukku), Kyong (Kyon), Laihka (Legya), Lawksawk (Yatsauk), Loi-ai (Lwe-e), Loilong (Lwelong), Loimaw (Lwemaw), Nyaung Shwe and many more.

Mohnyin, in particular, constantly raided Ava&#x27;s territory in the early 16th century. The Monhyin-led Confederation of Shan States, in alliance with Prome Kingdom, captured Ava itself in 1527. The Confederation defeated its erstwhile ally Prome in 1532, and ruled all of Upper Burma except Taungoo. But the Confederation was marred by internal bickering, and could not stop Taungoo, which conquered Ava in 1555 and all of the Shan States by 1563.

===Arakan (1287–1785)===

Although Arakan had been de facto independent since the late Pagan period, the Laungkyet dynasty of Arakan was ineffectual. Until the founding of the Mrauk-U Kingdom in 1429, Arakan was often caught between bigger neighbours, and found itself a battlefield during the Forty Years&#x27; War between Ava and Pegu. Mrauk-U went on to be a powerful kingdom in its own right between 15th and 17th centuries, including East Bengal between 1459 and 1666. Arakan was the only post-Pagan kingdom not to be annexed by the Taungoo dynasty.

==Toungoo dynasty (1510–1752)==
===First Toungoo Empire (1510–99)===

Beginning in the 1480s, Ava faced constant internal rebellions and external attacks from the Shan States, and began to disintegrate. In 1510, Taungoo, located in the remote southeastern corner of the Ava kingdom, also declared independence. When the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava in 1527, many refugees fled southeast to Taungoo, the only kingdom in peace, and one surrounded by larger hostile kingdoms.

Taungoo, led by its ambitious king Tabinshwehti and his deputy general Bayinnaung, would go on to reunify the petty kingdoms that had existed since the fall of the Pagan Empire, and found the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. First, the upstart kingdom defeated a more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Taungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1534–41). Tabinshwehti moved the capital to newly captured Bago in 1539.

Taungoo had expanded its authority up to Pagan by 1544 but failed to conquer Arakan in 1545–47 and Siam in 1547–49. Tabinshwehti&#x27;s successor Bayinnaung continued the policy of expansion, conquering Ava in 1555, Nearer/Cis-Salween Shan States (1557), Lan Na (1558), Manipur (1560), Farther/Trans-Salween Shan states (1562–63), the Siam (1564, 1569), and Lan Xang (1565–74), and bringing much of western and central mainland Southeast Asia under his rule.
Bayinnaung put in place a lasting administrative system that reduced the power of hereditary Shan chiefs, and brought Shan customs in line with low-land norms. But he could not replicate an effective administrative system everywhere in his far flung empire. His empire was a loose collection of former sovereign kingdoms, whose kings were loyal to him as the Cakkavatti (, ; Universal Ruler), not the kingdom of Taungoo.

The overextended empire unravelled soon after Bayinnaung&#x27;s death in 1581. Siam broke away in 1584 and went to war with Burma until 1605. By 1597, the kingdom had lost all its possessions, including Taungoo, the ancestral home of the dynasty. In 1599, the Arakanese forces aided by Portuguese mercenaries, and in alliance with the rebellious Taungoo forces, sacked Pegu. The country fell into chaos, with each region claiming a king. Portuguese mercenary Filipe de Brito e Nicote promptly rebelled against his Arakanese masters, and established Goa-backed Portuguese rule at Thanlyin in 1603.

Despite being a tumultuous time for Myanmar, the Taungoo expansions increased the international reach of the nation. Newly rich merchants from Myanmar traded as far as the Rajahnate of Cebu in the Philippines where they sold Burmese Sugar (&quot;śarkarā&quot;) for Cebuano gold. Filipinos also had merchant communities in Myanmar, historian William Henry Scott, quoting the Portuguese manuscript Summa Orientalis, noted that Mottama in Burma (Myanmar) had a large presence of merchants from Mindanao, Philippines. The Lucoes, a rival to the other Filipino group, the Mindanaoans, who instead came from the island of Luzon, were also hired as mercenaries and soldiers for both Siam (Thailand) and Burma (Myanmar), in the Burmese-Siamese Wars, the same case as the Portuguese, who were also mercenaries for both sides.

===Restored Taungoo Kingdom (Nyaungyan Restoration) (1599–1752)===
While the interregnum that followed the fall of the Pagan Empire lasted over 250 years (1287–1555), that following the fall of First Taungoo was relatively short-lived. One of Bayinnaung&#x27;s sons, Nyaungyan Min, immediately began the reunification effort, successfully restoring central authority over Upper Burma and nearer Shan states by 1606.

In 1535, King Tabinshwehti reunified Burma and founded the second Burmese Empire (Taungû dynasty, 1535–1752). This empire is almost constantly at war with the kingdom of Ayutthaya, in present-day Thailand. Faced with revolts and Portuguese incursions, the Taungû dynasty retreated to central Burma.

In the middle of the 16th century, King Tabinshwehti, originally from a southern province, and his son succeeded, with the help of the Portuguese, in reunifying the country. From 1599, the Kingdom of Pegu was under the management of the Eastern Portuguese Empire.

She reunified the country again in 1613 and definitively repelled attempts at Portuguese conquest. But the revolt of the Mons in the south of the country, encouraged by the French in India, weakened the kingdom which finally collapsed in 1752.

His successor Anaukpetlun defeated the Portuguese at Thanlyin in 1613. He recovered the upper Tanintharyi coast to Dawei and Lan Na from the Siamese by 1614. He also captured the trans-Salween Shan states (Kengtung and Sipsongpanna) in 1622–26.

His brother Thalun rebuilt the war-torn country. He ordered the first ever census in Burmese history in 1635, which showed that the kingdom had about two million people. By 1650, the three able kings–Nyaungyan, Anaukpetlun, and Thalun–had successfully rebuilt a smaller but far more manageable kingdom.

More importantly, the new dynasty proceeded to create a legal and political system whose basic features would continue under the Konbaung dynasty well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. It also reined in the continuous growth of monastic wealth and autonomy, giving a greater tax base. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. Except for a few occasional rebellions and an external war—Burma defeated Siam&#x27;s attempt to take Lan Na and Mottama in 1662–64—the kingdom was largely at peace for the rest of the 17th century.

The kingdom entered a gradual decline, and the authority of the &quot;palace kings&quot; deteriorated rapidly in the 1720s. From 1724 onwards, the Meitei people began raiding the upper Chindwin River. In 1727, southern Lan Na (Chiang Mai) successfully revolted, leaving just northern Lan Na (Chiang Saen) under an increasingly nominal Burmese rule. Meitei raids intensified in the 1730s, reaching increasingly deeper parts of central Burma.

In 1740, the Mon in Lower Burma began a rebellion, and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and by 1745 controlled much of Lower Burma. The Siamese also moved their authority up the Tanintharyi coast by 1752. Hanthawaddy invaded Upper Burma in November 1751, and captured Ava on 23 March 1752, ending the 266-year-old Taungoo dynasty.

==Konbaung dynasty (1752–1885)==
===Reunification===
Soon after the fall of Ava, a new dynasty rose in Shwebo to challenge the authority of Hanthawaddy. Over the next 70 years, the highly militaristic Konbaung dynasty went on to create the largest Burmese empire, second only to the empire of Bayinnaung. By 1759, King Alaungpaya&#x27;s Konbaung forces had reunited all of Burma (and Manipur), extinguished the Mon-led Hanthawaddy dynasty once and for all, and driven out the European powers who provided arms to Hanthawaddy—the French from Thanlyin and the English from Cape Negrais.

===Wars with Siam and China===

The kingdom then went to war with the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which had occupied up the Tanintharyi coast to Mottama during the Burmese civil war (1740–1757), and had provided shelter to the Mon refugees. By 1767, the Konbaung armies had subdued much of Laos and defeated Siam. But they could not finish off the remaining Siamese resistance as they were forced to defend against four invasions by Qing China (1765–1769). While the Burmese defences held in &quot;the most disastrous frontier war the Qing dynasty had ever waged&quot;, the Burmese were preoccupied with another impending invasion by the world&#x27;s largest empire for years. The Qing kept a heavy military line-up in the border areas for about one decade in an attempt to wage another war while imposing a ban on inter-border trade for two decades.

The Ayutthaya Kingdom used the Konbaung preoccupation with the Qing to recover their lost territories by 1770, and in addition, went on to capture much of Lan Na by 1775, ending over two centuries of Burmese suzerainty over the region. They went to war again in 1775–1776, 1785–1786, 1787, 1792, 1803–1808, 1809–1812 and 1849–1855, but these all resulted in a stalemate. After decades of war, the two countries essentially exchanged Tanintharyi (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Siam).

===Westward expansion and wars with British Empire===

Faced with a powerful China in the northeast and a resurgent Siam in the southeast, King Bodawpaya turned westward for expansion. He conquered Arakan in 1785, annexed Manipur in 1814, and captured Assam in 1817–1819, leading to a long ill-defined border with British India. Bodawpaya&#x27;s successor King Bagyidaw was left to put down British instigated rebellions in Manipur in 1819 and Assam in 1821–1822. Cross-border raids by rebels from the British protected territories and counter-cross-border raids by the Burmese led to the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26).

Lasting 2 years and costing 13 million pounds, the first Anglo-Burmese War was the longest and most expensive war in British Indian history, but ended in a decisive British victory. Burma ceded all of Bodawpaya&#x27;s western acquisitions (Arakan, Manipur and Assam) plus Tenasserim. Burma was crushed for years by repaying a large indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million). In 1852, the British unilaterally and easily seized the Pegu province in the Second Anglo-Burmese War.

After the war, King Mindon Min tried to modernise the Burmese state and economy, and made trade and territorial concessions to stave off further British encroachments, including ceding the Karenni States to the British in 1875. Nonetheless, the British, alarmed by the consolidation of French Indochina, annexed the remainder of the country in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885, and sent the last Burmese king Thibaw Min and his family to exile in India.

===Administrative and economic reforms===
Konbaung kings extended administrative reforms first begun in the Restored Taungoo dynasty period (1599–1752), and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. Konbaung kings tightened control in the low lands and reduced the hereditary privileges of Shan saophas (chiefs). Konbaung officials, particularly after 1780, began commercial reforms that increased government income and rendered it more predictable. Money economy continued to gain ground. In 1857, the crown inaugurated a full-fledged system of cash taxes and salaries, assisted by the country&#x27;s first standardised silver coinage.

===Culture===
Cultural integration continued. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley, with the Mon language and ethnicity completely eclipsed by 1830. The nearer Shan principalities adopted more lowland norms. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females). Monastic and lay elites around the Konbaung kings, particularly from Bodawpaya&#x27;s reign, also launched a major reformation of Burmese intellectual life and monastic organisation and practice known as the Sudhamma Reformation. It led to amongst other things Burma&#x27;s first proper state histories.

==British rule==


Britain made Burma a province of India in 1886 with the capital at Rangoon. Traditional Burmese society was drastically altered by the demise of the monarchy and the separation of religion and state. Though war officially ended after only a couple of weeks, resistance continued in northern Burma until 1890, with the British finally resorting to a systematic destruction of villages and appointment of new officials to finally halt all guerrilla activity. The economic nature of society also changed dramatically. After the opening of the Suez Canal, the demand for Burmese rice grew and vast tracts of land were opened up for cultivation. However, to prepare the new land for cultivation, farmers were forced to borrow money from Indian moneylenders called chettiars at high interest rates and were often foreclosed on and evicted losing land and livestock. Most of the jobs also went to indentured Indian labourers, and whole villages became outlawed as they resorted to &#x27;dacoity&#x27; (armed robbery). While the Burmese economy grew, most of the power and wealth remained in the hands of several British firms, Anglo-Burmese people, and migrants from India. The civil service was largely staffed by the Anglo-Burmese community and Indians, and Bamars were largely excluded almost entirely from military service.

By around the start of the 20th century, a nationalist movement began to take shape in the form of the Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association (YMBA), modelled on the YMCA, as religious associations were allowed by the colonial authorities. They were later superseded by the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) which was linked with &quot;Wunthanu athin&quot; or National Associations that sprang up in villages throughout Burma proper. Between 1900 – 1911 the &quot;Irish Buddhist&quot; U Dhammaloka challenged Christianity and British rule on religious grounds. A new generation of Burmese leaders arose in the early 20th century from amongst the educated classes that were permitted to go to London to study law. They came away from this experience with the belief that the Burmese situation could be improved through reform. Progressive constitutional reform in the early 1920s led to a legislature with limited powers, a university and more autonomy for Burma within the administration of India. Efforts were also undertaken to increase the representation of Burmese in the civil service. Some people began to feel that the rate of change was not fast enough and the reforms not expansive enough.

In 1920 the first university students strike in history broke out in protest against the new University Act which the students believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. &#x27;National Schools&#x27; sprang up across the country in protest against the colonial education system, and the strike came to be commemorated as &#x27;National Day&#x27;. There were further strikes and anti-tax protests in the later 1920s led by the &quot;Wunthanu athin&quot;s. Prominent among the political activists were Buddhist monks (&quot;pongyi&quot;), such as U Ottama and U Seinda in the Arakan who subsequently led an armed rebellion against the British and later the nationalist government after independence, and U Wisara, the first martyr of the movement to die after a protracted hunger strike in prison. (One of the main thoroughfares in Yangon is named after U Wisara.) In December 1930, a local tax protest by Saya San in Tharrawaddy quickly grew into first a regional and then a national insurrection against the government. Lasting for two years, the Galon Rebellion, named after the mythical garuda — the enemy of the nāgas (i.e., the British) – emblazoned on the pennants the rebels carried, required thousands of British troops to suppress along with promises of further political reform. The eventual trial of Saya San, who was executed, allowed several future national leaders, including Ba Maw and U Saw, who participated in his defence, to rise to prominence.

May 1930 saw the founding of the &quot;Dobama Asiayone&quot; (&quot;We Bamars Association&quot;) whose members called themselves &quot;Thakin&quot; (an ironic name since &quot;thakin&quot; means &quot;master&quot; in Burmese, rather like &quot;sahib&quot;— proclaiming that they were the true masters of the country entitled to the term usurped by the colonial masters). The second university students strike in 1936 was triggered by the expulsion of Aung San and Ko Nu, leaders of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU), for refusing to reveal the name of the author who had written an article in their university magazine, making a scathing attack on one of the senior university officials. It spread to Mandalay leading to the formation of the All Burma Students Union (ABSU). Aung San and Nu subsequently joined the Thakin movement progressing from student to national politics. The British separated Burma from India in 1937 and granted the colony a new constitution calling for a fully elected assembly, but this proved to be a divisive issue as some Burmese felt that this was a ploy to exclude them from any further Indian reforms whereas other Burmese saw any action that removed Burma from the control of India to be a positive step. Ba Maw served as the first prime minister of Burma, but he was succeeded by U Saw in 1939, who served as prime minister from 1940 until he was arrested on 19 January 1942 by the British for communicating with the Japanese.

A wave of strikes and protests that started from the oilfields of central Burma in 1938 became a general strike with far-reaching consequences. In Rangoon student protesters, after successfully picketing the Secretariat, the seat of the colonial government, were charged by mounted police from the Indian Imperial Police wielding batons, which killed a Rangoon University student called Aung Kyaw. In Mandalay, the colonial police shot into a crowd of protesters led by Buddhist monks, killing 17 people. The movement became known as &quot;Htaung thoun ya byei ayeidawbon&quot; (the &#x27;1300 Revolution&#x27; named after the Burmese calendar year), and 20 December, the day the first martyr Aung Kyaw fell, commemorated by students as &#x27;Bo Aung Kyaw Day&#x27;.

==World War II==

Some Burmese nationalists saw the outbreak of World War II as an opportunity to extort concessions from the British in exchange for support in the war effort. Other Burmese, such as the Thakin movement, opposed Burma&#x27;s participation in the war under any circumstances. Aung San co-founded the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) with other Thakins in August 1939. Marxist literature as well as tracts from the Sinn Féin movement in Ireland had been widely circulated and read among political activists. Aung San also co-founded the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (PRP), renamed the Socialist Party after World War II. He was also instrumental in founding the Freedom Bloc by forging an alliance of the Dobama, ABSU, politically active monks and Ba Maw&#x27;s Poor Man&#x27;s Party. After the Dobama organisation called for a national uprising, an arrest warrant was issued for many of the organisation&#x27;s leaders including Aung San, who escaped to China. Aung San&#x27;s intention was to make contact with the Chinese Communist Party but he was detected by the Japanese authorities who offered him support by forming a secret intelligence unit called the &quot;Minami Kikan&quot; headed by Colonel Suzuki with the objective of closing the Burma Road and supporting a national uprising. Aung San briefly returned to Burma to enlist twenty-nine young men who went to Japan with him to receive military training on Hainan Island, China, and they came to be known as the &quot;Thirty Comrades&quot;. When the Japanese occupied Bangkok in December 1941, Aung San announced the formation of the Burma Independence Army (BIA) in anticipation of the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942.

The BIA formed a provisional government in some areas of the country in the spring of 1942, but there were differences within the Japanese leadership over the future of Burma. While Colonel Suzuki encouraged the Thirty Comrades to form a provisional government, the Japanese Military leadership had never formally accepted such a plan. Eventually the Japanese Army turned to Ba Maw to form a government. During the war in 1942, the BIA had grown in an uncontrolled manner, and in many districts officials and even criminals appointed themselves to the BIA. It was reorganised as the Burma Defence Army (BDA) under the Japanese but still headed by Aung San. While the BIA had been an irregular force, the BDA was recruited by selection and trained as a conventional army by Japanese instructors. Ba Maw was afterwards declared head of state, and his cabinet included both Aung San as War Minister and the Communist leader Thakin Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture as well as the Socialist leaders Thakins Nu and Mya. When the Japanese declared Burma, in theory, independent in 1943, the Burma Defence Army (BDA) was renamed the Burma National Army (BNA).

===Joining the Allies===
It soon became apparent that Japanese promises of independence were merely a sham and that Ba Maw was deceived. As the war turned against the Japanese, they declared Burma a fully sovereign state on 1 August 1943, but this was just another facade. Disillusioned, Aung San began negotiations with Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe, and Socialist leaders Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein which led to the formation of the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO) in August 1944 at a secret meeting of the CPB, the PRP and the BNA in Pegu. The AFO was later renamed the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL). Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe, while in Insein prison in July 1941, had co-authored the &quot;Insein Manifesto&quot; which, against the prevailing opinion in the Dobama movement, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British in a broad allied coalition which should include the Soviet Union. Soe had already gone underground to organise resistance against the Japanese occupation, and Thakin Than Tun was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe, while other Communist leaders Thakin Thein Pe and Tin Shwe made contact with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India.

There were informal contacts between the AFO and the Allies in 1944 and 1945 through the British organisation Force 136. On 27 March 1945 the Burma National Army rose up in a countrywide rebellion against the Japanese. 27 March had been celebrated as &#x27;Resistance Day&#x27; until the military renamed it &#x27;Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) Day&#x27;. Aung San and others subsequently began negotiations with Lord Mountbatten and officially joined the Allies as the Patriotic Burmese Forces (PBF). At the first meeting, the AFO represented itself to the British as the provisional government of Burma with Thakin Soe as chairman and Aung San as a member of its ruling committee. The Japanese were routed from most of Burma by May 1945. Negotiations then began with the British over the disarming of the AFO and the participation of its troops in a post-war Burma Army. Some veterans had been formed into a paramilitary force under Aung San, called the &quot;Pyithu yèbaw tat&quot; or People&#x27;s Volunteer Organisation (PVO), and were openly drilling in uniform. The absorption of the PBF was concluded successfully at the Kandy conference in Ceylon in September 1945.

Under Japanese occupation, 170,000 to 250,000 civilians died. Inter-ethnic tensions were further inflamed during the occupation as many minority ethnic groups such as the Karen and the Kachin remained loyal to the British. This caused further bloodshed as communal violence erupted in several places.

==Following World War II==
The surrender of the Japanese brought a military administration to Burma and demands to try Aung San for his involvement in a murder during military operations in 1942. Lord Mountbatten realised that this was an impossibility considering Aung San&#x27;s popular appeal.

After the war ended, the British Governor, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith returned. The restored government established a political program that focused on physical reconstruction of the country and delayed discussion of independence.

The AFPFL opposed the government, leading to political instability in the country. A rift had also developed in the AFPFL between the Communists and Aung San together with the Socialists over strategy, which led to Than Tun being forced to resign as general secretary in July 1946 and the expulsion of the CPB from the AFPFL the following October.

Dorman-Smith was replaced by Sir Hubert Rance as the new governor, and almost immediately after his appointment the Rangoon Police went on strike. The strike, starting in September 1946, then spread from the police to government employees and came close to becoming a general strike.

Rance calmed the situation by meeting with Aung San and convincing him to join the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council along with other members of the AFPFL. The new executive council, which now had increased credibility in the country, began negotiations for Burmese independence, which were concluded successfully in London as the Aung San-Attlee Agreement on 27 January 1947. The agreement left parts of the communist and conservative branches of the AFPFL dissatisfied, however, sending the Red Flag Communists led by Thakin Soe underground and the conservatives into opposition.

Aung San also succeeded in concluding an agreement with ethnic minorities for a unified Burma at the Panglong Conference on 12 February, celebrated since as &#x27;Union Day&#x27;. U Aung Zan Wai, U Pe Khin, Myoma U Than Kywe, Major Aung, Sir Maung Gyi and Dr. Sein Mya Maung. were most important negotiators and leaders of the historical pinlon (panglong) Conference negotiated with Burma national top leader General Aung San and other top leaders in 1947. All these leaders decided to join to form the Union of Burma. Union day celebration is one of the greatest in the history of Burma. The popularity of the AFPFL, now dominated by Aung San and the Socialists, was eventually confirmed when it won an overwhelming victory in the April 1947 constituent assembly elections. On 19 July 1947 U Saw, a conservative pre-war Prime Minister of Burma, engineered the assassination of Aung San and several members of his cabinet including his eldest brother Ba Win, while meeting in the Secretariat. 19 July has been commemorated since as Martyrs&#x27; Day. Shortly after, rebellion broke out in the Arakan led by the veteran monk U Seinda, and it began to spread to other districts.

Thakin Nu, the Socialist leader, was now asked to form a new cabinet, and he presided over Burmese independence which was established under the Burma Independence Act 1947 on 4 January 1948. The popular sentiment to part with the British was so strong at the time that Burma opted not to join the Commonwealth of Nations, unlike India or Pakistan.

==Independent Myanmar==
===1948–1962===
Civil war broke out almost immediately following independence, as the Communist Party of Burma withdrew from the government and began its insurrection, while the Karen insurgency began the following year. The first years of Burmese independence were marked by successive insurgencies by the Red Flag Communists led by Thakin Soe, the White Flag Communists led by Thakin Than Tun, the &quot;Yebaw Hpyu&quot; or (White Band) People&#x27;s Volunteer Organisation led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the Thirty Comrades, army rebels calling themselves the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA) led by Communist officers Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo Yè Htut – all three of them members of the Thirty Comrades, Arakanese Muslims or the Mujahid, and the Karen National Union (KNU).

After the Communist victory in China in 1949, remote areas of Northern Burma were for many years controlled by an army of Kuomintang (KMT) forces under the command of General Li Mi.

Burma accepted foreign assistance in rebuilding the country in these early years, but continued American support for the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid, refusing to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955. Burma generally strove to be neutral in world affairs, and was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Israel and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

By 1958, the country was beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the AFPFL into two factions. One faction was led by Thakins Nu and Tin, and the other was led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. And this was despite the unexpected success of U Nu&#x27;s &quot;Arms for Democracy&quot; offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the Pa-O, some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms.

The situation however became very unstable in parliament, with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have &#x27;crypto-communists&#x27; amongst them. Army hardliners now saw the &#x27;threat&#x27; of the CPB coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and in the end U Nu &#x27;invited&#x27; Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country. Over 400 &#x27;communist sympathisers&#x27; were arrested, of which 153 were deported to the Coco Island in the Andaman Sea. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. The &quot;Botataung&quot;, &quot;Kyemon&quot; and &quot;Rangoon Daily&quot; newspapers were also closed down.

Ne Win&#x27;s caretaker government successfully improved the security situation and paved the way for new general elections in 1960 that returned U Nu&#x27;s Union Party with a large majority. The situation did not remain stable for long, when the Shan Federal Movement, started by Nyaung Shwe Sawbwa Sao Shwe Thaik (the first President of independent Burma 1948–52) and aspiring to a &#x27;loose&#x27; federation, was seen as a separatist movement insisting on the government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the 1947 Constitution. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan Sawbwas of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959.

===1962–1988===
On 2 March 1962, Ne Win, with sixteen other senior military officers, staged a coup d&#x27;état, arrested U Nu, Sao Shwe Thaik and several others, and declared a socialist state to be run by their &quot;Union Revolutionary Council&quot;. Sao Shwe Thaik&#x27;s son, Sao Mye Thaik, was shot dead in what was generally described as a &quot;bloodless&quot; coup. Thibaw Sawbwa Sao Kya Seng also disappeared mysteriously after being stopped at a checkpoint near Taunggyi.

A number of protests followed the coup, and initially the military&#x27;s response was mild. However, on 7 July 1962, a peaceful student protest on Rangoon University campus was suppressed by the military, killing over 100 students. The next day, the army blew up the Students Union building. Peace talks were convened between the RC and various armed insurgent groups in 1963, but without any breakthrough, and during the talks as well as in the aftermath of their failure, hundreds were arrested in Rangoon and elsewhere from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. All opposition parties were banned on 28 March 1964. The Kachin insurgency by the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) had begun earlier in 1961 triggered by U Nu&#x27;s declaration of Buddhism as the state religion, and the Shan State Army (SSA), led by Sao Shwe Thaik&#x27;s wife Mahadevi and son Chao Tzang Yaunghwe, launched a rebellion in 1964 as a direct consequence of the 1962 military coup.

Ne Win quickly took steps to transform Burma into his vision of a &quot;socialist state&quot; and to isolate the country from contact with the rest of the world. A one-party system was established with his newly formed Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) in complete control. Commerce and industry were nationalised across the board, but the economy did not grow at first if at all as the government put too much emphasis on industrial development at the expense of agriculture. In April 1972, General Ne Win and the rest of the Union Revolutionary Council retired from the military, but now as U Ne Win, he continued to run the country through the BSPP. A new constitution was promulgated in January 1974 that resulted in the creation of a People&#x27;s Assembly (&quot;Pyithu Hluttaw&quot;) that held supreme legislative, executive, and judicial authority, and local People&#x27;s Councils. Ne Win became the president of the new government.

Beginning in May 1974, a wave of strikes hit Rangoon and elsewhere in the country against a backdrop of corruption, inflation and food shortages, especially rice. In Rangoon workers were arrested at the Insein railway yard, and troops opened fire on workers at the Thamaing textile mill and Simmalaik dockyard. In December 1974, the biggest anti-government demonstrations to date broke out over the funeral of former UN Secretary-General U Thant. U Thant had been former prime minister U Nu&#x27;s closest advisor in the 1950s and was seen as a symbol of opposition to the military regime. The Burmese people felt that U Thant was denied a state funeral that he deserved as a statesman of international stature because of his association with U Nu.

On 23 March 1976, over 100 students were arrested for holding a peaceful ceremony () to mark the centenary of the birth of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing who was the greatest Burmese poet and writer and nationalist leader of the 20th century history of Burma. He had inspired a whole generation of Burmese nationalists and writers by his work mainly written in verse, fostering immense pride in their history, language and culture, and urging them to take direct action such as strikes by students and workers. It was Hmaing, as leader of the mainstream Dobama (Us Burma) Organization, who sent the Thirty Comrades abroad for military training, which became the origin of modern Myanmar Army, and after independence devoted his life to internal peace and national reconciliation until he died at the age of 88 in 1964. Hmaing lies buried in a mausoleum at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda.

A young staff officer called Captain Ohn Kyaw Myint conspired with a few fellow officers in 1976 to assassinate Ne Win and San Yu, but the plot was uncovered and the officer tried and hanged.

In 1978, a military operation was conducted against the Rohingya Muslims in Arakan, called the King Dragon operation, causing 250,000 refugees to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.

U Nu, after his release from prison in October 1966, had left Burma in April 1969, and formed the Parliamentary Democracy Party (PDP) the following August in Bangkok, Thailand with the former Thirty Comrades, Bo Let Ya, co-founder of the CPB and former Minister of Defence and deputy prime minister, Bo Yan Naing, and U Thwin, ex-BIA and former Minister of Trade. Another member of the Thirty Comrades, Bohmu Aung, former Minister of Defence, joined later. The fourth, Bo Setkya, who had gone underground after the 1962 coup, died in Bangkok shortly before U Nu arrived. The PDP launched an armed rebellion across the Thai border from 1972 till 1978 when Bo Let Ya was killed in an attack by the Karen National Union (KNU). U Nu, Bohmu Aung and Bo Yan Naing returned to Rangoon after the 1980 amnesty. Ne Win also secretly held peace talks later in 1980 with the KIO and the CPB, again ending in a deadlock as before.

===Crisis and the 1988 Uprising===

Ne Win retired as president in 1981, but remained in power as Chairman of the BSPP until his sudden unexpected announcement to step down on 23 July 1988. In the 1980s, the economy began to grow as the government relaxed restrictions on foreign aid, but by the late 1980s falling commodity prices and rising debt led to an economic crisis. This led to economic reforms in 1987–1988 that relaxed socialist controls and encouraged foreign investment. This was not enough, however, to stop growing turmoil in the country, compounded by periodic &quot;demonetisation&quot; of certain bank notes in the currency, the last of which was decreed in September 1987, wiping out the savings of the vast majority of people.

In September 1987, Burma&#x27;s de facto ruler U Ne Win suddenly cancelled certain currency notes, which caused a great down-turn in the economy. The main reason for the cancellation of these notes was superstition on U Ne Win&#x27;s part, as he considered the number nine his lucky number—he only allowed 45 and 90 kyat notes, because these were divisible by nine. Burma&#x27;s admittance to Least Developed Country status by the UN the following December highlighted its economic bankruptcy.

Triggered by brutal police repression of student-led protests causing the death of over a hundred students and civilians in March and June 1988, widespread protests and demonstrations broke out on 8 August throughout the country. The military responded by firing into the crowds, alleging Communist infiltration. Violence, chaos and anarchy reigned. Civil administration had ceased to exist, and by September of that year, the country was on the verge of a revolution. The armed forces, under the nominal command of General Saw Maung, staged a coup on 8 August to restore order. During the 8888 Uprising, as it became known, the military killed over 3,000 people. The military swept aside the Constitution of 1974 in favour of martial law under the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) with Saw Maung as chairman and prime minister.

At a special six-hour press conference on 5 August 1989, Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the SLORC Secretary 1, and chief of Military Intelligence Service (MIS), claimed that the uprising had been orchestrated by the Communist Party of Burma through its underground organisation. Although there had inevitably been some underground CPB presence as well as that of ethnic insurgent groups, there was no evidence of their being in charge to any extent. In fact, in March 1989, the CPB leadership was overthrown by a rebellion by the Kokang and Wa troops that it had come to depend on after losing its former strongholds in central Burma and re-establishing bases in the northeast in the late 1960s; the Communist leaders were soon forced into exile across the Chinese border.

===1990–2006===

The military government announced a change of name for the country in English from &quot;Burma&quot; to &quot;Myanmar&quot; in 1989. It also continued the economic reforms started by the old regime and called for a Constituent Assembly to revise the 1974 Constitution. This led to multiparty elections in May 1990 in which the newly formed National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory over the National Unity Party (NUP, the successor to the BSPP) and about a dozen smaller parties.

The military ignored the results and continued to rule. The two leaders of the NLD, Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San, were kept under the house arrest imposed on them the previous year. Burma came under increasing international pressure to convene the elected assembly, particularly after Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and also faced economic sanctions. In April 1992 the military replaced Saw Maung with General Than Shwe.

Than Shwe released U Nu from prison and relaxed some of the restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s house arrest, finally releasing her in 1995, although she was forbidden to leave Rangoon. Than Shwe also finally allowed a National Convention to meet in January 1993, but insisted that the assembly preserve a major role for the military in any future government, and suspended the convention from time to time. The NLD, fed up with the interference, walked out in late 1995, and the assembly was finally dismissed in March 1996 without producing a constitution.

During the 1990s, the military regime had also had to deal with several insurgencies by tribal minorities along its borders. General Khin Nyunt was able to negotiate cease-fire agreements that ended the fighting with the Kokang, hill tribes such as the Wa, and the Kachin, but the Karen would not negotiate. The military finally captured the main Karen base at Manerplaw in spring 1995, but there has still been no final peace settlement. Khun Sa, a major opium warlord who nominally controlled parts of Shan State, made a deal with the government in December 1995 after US pressure.

After the failure of the National Convention to create a new constitution, tensions between the government and the NLD mounted, resulting in two major crackdowns on the NLD in 1996 and 1997. The SLORC was abolished in November 1997 and replaced by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), but it was merely a cosmetic change. Continuing reports of human rights violations in Burma led the United States to intensify sanctions in 1997, and the European Union followed suit in 2000.

The military placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest again in September 2000 until May 2002, when her travel restrictions outside of Rangoon were also lifted. Reconciliation talks were held with the government, but these came to a stalemate and Suu Kyi was once again taken into custody in May 2003 after an ambush on her motorcade reportedly by a pro-military mob. The government also carried out another large-scale crackdown on the NLD, arresting many of its leaders and closing down most of its offices. The situation in Burma remains tense to this day.

In August 2003, Kyin Nyunt announced a seven-step &quot;roadmap to democracy&quot;. There was no timetable or any or independent mechanism for verifying that it is moving forward. Most Western governments and Burma&#x27;s neighbours have been sceptical of the roadmap.

On 17 February 2005, the government reconvened the National Convention, for the first time since 1993, in an attempt to rewrite the Constitution. However, major pro-democracy organisations and parties, including the National League for Democracy, were barred from participating, the military allowing only selected smaller parties. It was adjourned once again in January 2006.

In November 2005, the military junta started moving the government away from Yangon to an unnamed location near Kyatpyay just outside Pyinmana, to a newly designated capital city. This public action follows a long term unofficial policy of moving critical military and government infrastructure away from Yangon to avoid a repetition of the events of 1988. On Armed Forces Day (27 March 2006), the capital was officially named Naypyidaw Myodaw (lit. Royal City of the Seat of Kings).

In November 2006, the International Labour Organization (ILO) announced it will be seeking – at the International Court of Justice – &quot;to prosecute members of the ruling Myanmar junta for crimes against humanity&quot; over the continuous forced labour of its citizens by the military. According to the ILO, an estimated 800,000 people are subject to forced labour in Myanmar.

===2007 anti-government protests===

The 2007 Burmese anti-government protests were a series of anti-government protests that started in Burma on 15 August 2007. The immediate cause of the protests was mainly the unannounced decision of the ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council, to remove fuel subsidies, which caused the price of diesel and petrol to suddenly rise as much as 100%, and the price of compressed natural gas for buses to increase fivefold in less than a week. The protest demonstrations were at first dealt with quickly and harshly by the junta, with dozens of protesters arrested and detained. Starting 18 September, the protests had been led by thousands of Buddhist monks, and those protests had been allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown on 26 September.

During the crackdown, there were rumours of disagreement within the Burmese military, but none were confirmed. At the time, independent sources reported, through pictures and accounts, 30 to 40 monks and 50 to 70 civilians killed as well as 200 beaten. However, other sources reveal more dramatic figures. In a White House statement President Bush said: &quot;Monks have been beaten and killed ... Thousands of pro-democracy protesters have been arrested&quot;. Some news reports referred to the protests as the Saffron Revolution.

On 7 February 2008, SPDC announced that a referendum for the Constitution would be held, and Elections by 2010. The 2008 Burmese constitutional referendum was held on 10 May and promised a &quot;discipline-flourishing democracy&quot; for the country in the future.

===Cyclone Nargis===
On 3 May 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated the country when winds of up to 215 km/h (135 mph) touched land in the densely populated, rice-farming delta of the Irrawaddy Division. It is estimated that more than 130,000 people died or went missing and damage totalled 10 billion US dollars; it was the worst natural disaster in Burmese history. The World Food Programme reported that, &quot;Some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas are wiped out.&quot;

The United Nations estimated that as many as 1 million were left homeless and the World Health Organization &quot;received reports of malaria outbreaks in the worst-affected area.&quot; Yet in the critical days following this disaster, Burma&#x27;s isolationist regime complicated recovery efforts by delaying the entry of United Nations planes delivering medicine, food, and other supplies. The government&#x27;s failure to permit entry for large-scale international relief efforts was described by the United Nations as &quot;unprecedented.&quot;

===2011–2016===

The 2011–2012 Burmese democratic reforms were an ongoing series of political, economic and administrative changes in Burma undertaken by the military-backed government. These reforms included the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and subsequent dialogues with her, establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, general amnesties of more than 200 political prisoners, institution of new labour laws that allow labour unions and strikes, relaxation of press censorship, and regulations of currency practices.

As a consequence of the reforms, ASEAN approved Burma&#x27;s bid for the chairmanship in 2014. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Burma on 1 December 2011, to encourage further progress; it was the first visit by a US Secretary of State in more than fifty years. United States President Barack Obama visited one year later, becoming the first US president to visit the country.

Suu Kyi&#x27;s party, the National League for Democracy, participated in by-elections held on 1 April 2012 after the government abolished laws that led to the NLD&#x27;s boycott of the 2010 general election. She led the NLD in winning the by-elections in a landslide, winning 41 out of 44 of the contested seats, with Suu Kyi herself winning a seat representing Kawhmu Constituency in the lower house of the Burmese Parliament.

2015 election results gave the National League for Democracy an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the Burmese parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency. However, clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups continued.

===2016–2021===
The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016 and, on 15 March 2016, Htin Kyaw was elected as the first non-military president of the country since the 1962 coup d&#x27;état. Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the newly created role of the State Counsellor, a position similar to Prime Minister, on 6 April 2016.

The resounding victory of Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s National League for Democracy in 2015 general elections raised hope for a successful transition of Myanmar from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system. However, internal political turmoil, crumbling economy and ethnic strife continued to make the transition to democracy a painful one. The 2017 murder of Ko Ni, a prominent Muslim lawyer and a key member of Myanmar&#x27;s governing National League for Democracy party is seen as a serious blow to the country&#x27;s fragile democracy. Mr. Ko Ni&#x27;s murder deprived Aung San Suu Kyi of his perspective as an adviser, particularly on reforming Myanmar&#x27;s military-drafted Constitution and ushering the country to democracy.

There was a military crackdown against Rohingya that occurred from October 2016 to January 2017, and the second has been occurring since August 2017. The crisis forced over a million Rohingya to flee to other countries. Most fled to Bangladesh, resulting in the creation of Kutupalong refugee camp, the world&#x27;s largest refugee camp.

At the general election on 8 November 2020 the National League for Democracy (NLD) won 396 out of 476 seats in parliament, an even larger margin of victory than in the 2015 election. The military&#x27;s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.

=== 2021–present ===

On February 1, 2021, Myanmar&#x27;s military, the Tatmadaw detained the state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other government members. The military handed power to the military chief Min Aung Hlaing and a state of emergency was declared for one year.

On 2 February 2021, healthcare workers and civil servants across the country, including in the national capital, Naypyidaw, launched a national civil disobedience movement (), in opposition to the coup d&#x27;état. Protesters have employed peaceful and nonviolent forms of protest, which include acts of civil disobedience, labour strikes, a military boycott campaign, a pot-banging movement, a red ribbon campaign, public protests, and formal recognition of the election results by elected representatives.

On 20 February, two people were shot dead and at least two dozens more were injured in Mandalay by the military in violent crackdown. These people were residents of Maha Aung Myay Township guarding government shipyard workers involved in the civil disobedience movement from the police who were forcing them back to work. In addition to firing live rounds, the police and military personnel also beat, arrested, used water cannon, and threw various objects such as marbles and stones at civilians.

As of 26 March 2021, at least 3,070 people have been detained, and at least 423 protesters have been killed by military or police forces.

Armed insurgencies by the People&#x27;s Defence Force of the National Unity Government have erupted throughout Myanmar. In many villages and towns junta forces attacks drove out tens of thousands of people at least. UNOCHA said that as of early September 2022, 974,000 people had been internally displaced since the coup. In addition, between the February 2021 coup and June 2022 over 40,000 people fled into neighboring countries, including many from communities close to the borders that came under regime attacks.

<text>James Stillman Rockefeller (June 8, 1902 – August 10, 2004) was a member of the prominent U.S. Rockefeller family. He won an Olympic rowing title for the United States, then became president of what eventually became Citigroup. He was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and a member of the board of overseers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

==Early life and rowing==
He was born on June 8, 1902, to William Goodsell Rockefeller (1870–1922) and Elsie Stillman, daughter of James Stillman, in the Manhattan borough of New York City. He graduated from The Taft School, Watertown, Connecticut, in 1920, and graduated from Yale University in 1924, where he was elected to Scroll and Key and Phi Beta Kappa. He was also a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. That same year Rockefeller captained a crew of Yale teammates that included Benjamin Spock. They won a gold medal in rowing at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Rockefeller appeared on the cover of &quot;Time magazine&quot; on July 7, 1924.

==Career==
Rockefeller returned from the Olympics and spent the next six years with the Wall Street banking firm of Brown Bros. &amp; Co. He joined the National City Bank in New York in 1930 and was president from 1952 to 1959 and chairman from 1959 to 1967. He retired as chairman in 1967. During his tenure, the bank merged with the smaller First National Bank and took the name The First National City Bank of New York.

Under each of his successors, the bank&#x27;s name has changed: George S. Moore shortened it to &quot;First National City Bank&quot; and formed a holding company, First National City Corp. Under Walter B. Wriston these became &quot;Citibank&quot; (the bank&#x27;s long-time nickname) and &quot;Citicorp&quot; respectively. Under John Reed the firm merged with Travelers Group to become Citigroup. During World War II, Rockefeller served in the Airborne Command.

==Personal life==
On April 15, 1925, he married Nancy Carnegie, who died in 1994. She was a granddaughter of Thomas M. Carnegie and grandniece of Andrew Carnegie. Nancy helped establish the Greenwich Maternal Health Center in 1935. Together, they had four children:

* James Stillman Rockefeller Jr. (1926–2025), who was married to Liv Coucheron Torp (d. 1969), who had previously been married to Thor Heyerdahl. He had previously been engaged to Margaret Wise Brown before her death.
* Nancy Sherlock Rockefeller, who married Barclay McFadden Jr. (d. 1973), After his death, she married Daniel Noyes Copp (d. 2015)
* Andrew Carnegie Rockefeller, who married Jean Victoria Mackay
* Georgia Stillman Rockefeller, who married James Harden Rose

Rockefeller died on August 10, 2004, at the age of 102 in Greenwich, Connecticut, following a stroke.

===Residences===
Rockefeller lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, in a brick Georgian mansion, built in 1929, with 11 bedrooms and 16 marble bathrooms on four levels. There are 12 fireplaces, an elevator, an outdoor pool and English gardens. His house was sold in 2004 for $13.4 million and resold in 2009 for $23.9 million.

In January 1937, he became the full owner of Long Valley Farm near Spring Lake in Cumberland County and Harnett County, North Carolina.

===Legacy===
At the time of his death, Rockefeller had four children, fourteen grandchildren, thirty-seven great-grandchildren, and one great-great-granddaughter. Aged 102, he was America&#x27;s oldest living Olympic champion, and the earliest living cover subject of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

<doc id="326634" wikidata="Q1067270" url="?curid=326634" title="Value engineering">
<text>Value engineering (VE) is a systematic analysis of the functions of various components and materials to lower the cost of goods, products and services with a tolerable loss of performance or functionality. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to cost. Value can therefore be manipulated by either improving the function or reducing the cost. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements. The term &quot;value management&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym of &quot;value engineering&quot;, and both promote the planning and delivery of projects with improved performance.

The reasoning behind value engineering is as follows: if marketers expect a product to become practically or stylistically obsolete within a specific length of time, they can design it to only last for that specific lifetime. The products could be built with higher-grade components, but with value engineering they are not because this would impose an unnecessary cost on the manufacturer, and to a limited extent also an increased cost on the purchaser. Value engineering will reduce these costs. A company will typically use the least expensive components that satisfy the product&#x27;s lifetime projections at a risk of product and company reputation.

Due to the very short life spans, however, which is often a result of this &quot;value engineering technique&quot;, planned obsolescence has become associated with product deterioration and inferior quality. Vance Packard once claimed this practice gave engineering as a whole a bad name, as it directed creative engineering energies toward short-term market ends. Philosophers such as Herbert Marcuse and Jacque Fresco have also criticized the economic and societal implications of this model.

==History==
Value engineering began at General Electric Co. during World War II. Because of the war, there were shortages of skilled labour, raw materials, and component parts. Lawrence Miles, Jerry Leftow, and Harry Erlicher at G.E. looked for acceptable substitutes. They noticed that these substitutions often reduced costs, improved the product, or both. What started out as an accident of necessity was turned into a systematic process. They called their technique &quot;value analysis&quot; or &quot;value control&quot;.

The U S Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships established a formal program of value engineering, overseen by Miles and Raymond Fountain, also from G.E., in 1957.

Since the 1970&#x27;s the US Government&#x27;s General Accounting Office (GAO) has recognised the benefit of value engineering. In a 1992 statement by L. Nye Stevens, Director of Government Business Operations Issues within the GAO, referred to &quot;considerable work&quot; done by the GAO on value engineering and the office&#x27;s recommendation that VE should be adopted by &quot;all federal construction agencies&quot;.

Dr. Paul Collopy, UAH Professor, ISEEM Department, has recommended an improvement to value engineering known as Value-Driven Design.

==Description==
Value engineering is sometimes taught within the project management, industrial engineering or architecture body of knowledge as a technique in which the value of a system&#x27;s outputs is superficially optimized by distorting a mix of performance (function) and costs. It is based on an analysis investigating systems, equipment, facilities, services, and supplies for providing necessary functions at superficial low life cycle cost while meeting the misunderstood requirement targets in performance, reliability, quality, and safety. In most cases this practice identifies and removes necessary functions of value expenditures, thereby decreasing the capabilities of the manufacturer and/or their customers. What this practice disregards in providing necessary functions of value are expenditures such as equipment maintenance and relationships between employee, equipment, and materials. For example, a machinist is unable to complete their quota because the drill press is temporarily inoperable due to lack of maintenance and the material handler is not doing their daily checklist, tally, log, invoice, and accounting of maintenance and materials each machinist needs to maintain the required productivity and adherence to section 4306.

VE follows a structured thought process that is based exclusively on &quot;function&quot;, i.e. what something &quot;does&quot;, not what it &quot;is&quot;. For example, a screwdriver that is being used to stir a can of paint has a &quot;function&quot; of mixing the contents of a paint can and not the original connotation of securing a screw into a screw-hole. In value engineering &quot;functions&quot; are always described in a two word abridgment consisting of an active verb and measurable noun (what is being done – the verb – and what it is being done to – the noun) and to do so in the most non-descriptive way possible. In the screwdriver and can of paint example, the most basic function would be &quot;blend liquid&quot; which is less descriptive than &quot;stir paint&quot; which can be seen to limit the action (by stirring) and to limit the application (only considers paint). 

Value engineering uses rational logic (a unique &quot;how&quot; – &quot;why&quot; questioning technique) and an irrational analysis of function to identify relationships that increase value. It is considered a quantitative method similar to the scientific method, which focuses on hypothesis-conclusion approaches to test relationships, and operations research, which uses model building to identify predictive relationships.

==Legal terminology==
In the United States, value engineering is specifically mandated for federal agencies by section 4306 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.):
:&quot;Each executive agency shall establish and maintain cost-effective value engineering procedures and processes.&quot;
:&quot;As used in this section, the term &#x27;value engineering&#x27; means an analysis of the functions of a program, project, system, product, item of equipment, building, facility, service, or supply of an executive agency, performed by qualified agency or contractor personnel, directed at improving performance, reliability, quality, safety, and life cycle costs.&quot;

An earlier bill, HR 281, the &quot;Systematic Approach for Value Engineering Act&quot; was proposed in 1990, which would have mandated the use of VE in major federally-sponsored construction, design or IT system contracts. This bill identified the objective of a value engineering review as &quot;reducing all costs (including initial and long-term costs) and improving quality, performance, productivity, efficiency, promptness, reliability, maintainability, and aesthetics&quot;.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 48 provides direction to federal agencies on the use of VE techniques. The FAR provides for 
*an incentive approach, under which a contractor&#x27;s participation in VE is voluntary; under this approach a contractor may at its own expense develop and submit a value engineering change proposal (VECP) for agency consideration, or
*a mandatory program, where the agency directs and funds for a specific VE project.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the lawfulness of undertaking value engineering discussions with a supplier in advance of contract award is one of the issues which was highlighted during the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire of 2017. The inquiry report was highly sceptical of the whole endeavour of value engineering:
==Professional association==
The Society of American Value Engineers (SAVE) was established in 1959. Since 1996, it has been known as SAVE International.

<text>The chorion is the outermost fetal membrane around the embryo in mammals, birds and reptiles (amniotes). It is also present around the embryo of other animals, like insects and molluscs. 

==Structure==
In humans and other therian mammals, the chorion is one of the fetal membranes that exist during pregnancy between the developing fetus and mother. The chorion and the amnion together form the amniotic sac. In humans it is formed by extraembryonic mesoderm and the two layers of trophoblast that surround the embryo and other membranes; the chorionic villi emerge from the chorion, invade the endometrium, and allow the transfer of nutrients from maternal blood to fetal blood.

===Layers===
The chorion consists of two layers: an outer formed by the trophoblast, and an inner formed by the extra-embryonic mesoderm.

The trophoblast is made up of an internal layer of cubical or prismatic cells, the cytotrophoblast or layer of Langhans, and an external multinucleated layer, the syncytiotrophoblast.

===Growth===
The chorion undergoes rapid proliferation and forms numerous processes, the &quot;chorionic villi&quot;, which invade and destroy the uterine decidua, while simultaneously absorbing nutritive materials from it for the growth of the embryo.

The chorionic villi are at first small and non-vascular, and consist of the trophoblast only, but they increase in size and , whereas the mesoderm, carrying branches of the umbilical vessels, grows into them, and they are vascularized.

Blood is carried to the villi by the paired umbilical arteries, which branch into chorionic arteries and enter the chorionic villi as cotyledon arteries. After circulating through the capillaries of the villi, the blood is returned to the embryo by the umbilical vein. Until about the end of the second month of pregnancy, the villi cover the entire chorion, and are almost uniform in size; but, after this, they develop unequally.

===Parts===

The part of the chorion that is in contact with the decidua capsularis undergoes atrophy, so that by the fourth month scarcely a trace of the villi is left. This part of the chorion becomes smooth, and is named the chorion laeve (from the Latin word &quot;levis&quot;, meaning smooth). As it takes no share in the formation of the placenta, this is also named the non-placental part of the chorion. As the chorion grows, the chorion laeve comes in contact with the decidua parietalis and these layers fuse.

The villi at the embryonic pole, which is in contact with the decidua basalis, increase greatly in size and complexity, and hence this part is named the chorion frondosum.

Thus the placenta develops from the chorion frondosum and the decidua basalis.

===Monochorionic twins===

&quot;Monochorionic twins&quot; are twins that share the same placenta. This occurs in 0.3% of all pregnancies, and in 75% of monozygotic (identical) twins, when the split takes place on or after the third day after fertilization. The remaining 25% of monozygous twins become &quot;dichorionic diamniotic&quot;. The condition may affect any type of multiple birth, resulting in &quot;monochorionic multiples&quot;.

===Infections===
Recent studies indicate that the chorion may be susceptible to pathogenic infections. Recent findings indicate that &quot;Ureaplasma parvum&quot; bacteria can infect the chorion tissue, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome. In addition, footprints of JC polyomavirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus have been detected in chorionic villi from females affected by spontaneous abortion as well as pregnant women. Another virus, BK polyomavirus has been detected in the same tissues, but with lesser extent.

== Other animals==

In reptiles, birds, and monotremes, the chorion is one of the four extraembryonic membranes that make up the amniotic egg that provide for the nutrients and protection needed for the embryo&#x27;s survival. It is located inside the albumen, which is the white of the egg. It encloses the embryo and the rest of the embryonic system. The chorion is also present in insects. During growth and development of the embryo, there is an increased need for oxygen. To compensate for this, the chorion and the allantois fuse together to form the chorioallantoic membrane. Together these form a double membrane, which functions to remove carbon dioxide and to replenish oxygen through the porous shell. At the time of hatching, the fetus becomes detached from the chorion as it emerges from the shell.

In insects, it develops by the follicle cells while the egg is in the ovary. Some mollusks also have chorions as part of their eggs. For example, fragile octopus eggs have only a chorion as their envelope.

<doc id="326643" wikidata="Q1839152" url="?curid=326643" title="Tom Cat">
<text>Thomas Jasper Cat Sr. also known simply as Tom, is an American cartoon character and one of the two titular main protagonists (the other being Jerry Mouse) in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s series of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; theatrical animated short films. Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, he is a blue-grey and white anthropomorphic (but usually silent) domestic short haired tuxedo British cat who first appeared in the 1940 MGM animated short &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;. The cat was initially known as &quot;Jasper&quot; during his debut in the short; however, beginning with his next appearance in &quot;The Midnight Snack&quot; he was known as &quot;Tom&quot; or &quot;Thomas&quot;.

==History==
===Tom and Jerry cartoons===
His name, &quot;Tom Cat&quot;, is based on &quot;tomcat&quot;, a word which refers to male cats. He is usually mute and rarely heard speaking with the exception of a few cartoons (such as 1943&#x27;s &quot;The Lonesome Mouse&quot;, 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Zoot Cat&quot;, 1947&#x27;s &quot;Part Time Pal&quot;, 1953&#x27;s &quot;Puppy Tale&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;). His only notable vocal sounds outside of this are his various screams whenever he is subjected to panic or, more frequently, pain. He is continuously after Jerry Mouse, for whom he sets traps, many of which backfire and cause damage to him rather than Jerry. His trademark scream was provided by creator William Hanna. Hanna&#x27;s recordings of Tom screaming were later used as a stock sound effect for other MGM cartoon characters, including a majority of Tex Avery&#x27;s shorts.

Tom has changed over the years, especially after the first episodes. For example, in his debut, he was quadrupedal. However, over the years (since the episode &quot;Dog Trouble&quot;), he has become almost completely bipedal and has human intelligence. In 1945 shorts he had twisted whiskers and his appearance kept changing. In the 1940s and early 1950s, he had white fur between his eyes. In newer cartoons, the white fur is gone. As a slapstick cartoon character, Tom has a superhuman level of elasticity.

Tom is usually defeated in the end (or very rarely, killed, like in &quot;Mouse Trouble&quot;, where he explodes), although there are some stories where he outwits and defeats Jerry. Besides Jerry, he also has trouble with other mouse or cat characters. One of them that appears frequently is Spike Bulldog. Spike regularly appears and usually assists Jerry and beats up Tom. Though in some occasions Tom beats him or he turns on Jerry (like his debut appearance in Dog Trouble). Usually when Tom is chasing Jerry after a bit Jerry turns the tables on Tom and beats him or uses an outside character such as Spike to beat Tom.

Tom has variously been portrayed as a house cat doing his job, and a victim of Jerry&#x27;s blackmail attempts, sometimes within the same short. He is almost always called by his full name &quot;Thomas&quot; by Mammy Two Shoes. In 1961 short Switchin&#x27; Kitten Tom has a membership card as belong to the &quot;International Brotherhood of Cats&quot;.

===&quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; and &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot;===
Tom and Jerry showed up together at the 1945 Technicolor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; where Tom briefly appears as a butler for King Jerry, the latter who has a dance sequence with Gene Kelly, and also in another musical with the same studio &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (1953), where, in a dream sequence, main character Katie Higgins (Esther Williams) does an underwater ballet with Tom and Jerry, as well as animated depictions of the different people in her life.

==Voice actors==
Despite almost every short depicting Tom as silent (besides his vocal sounds such as screaming and gasping), there are some cartoons which feature him speaking, with his first film appearance (along with co-star Jerry) in 1992, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie,&quot; being an example as Tom and Jerry talk throughout the film.

Here are several of his voiceover actors:

Tom has had a number of different voice actors over the years. When the character debuted in &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, voice actor Harry E. Lang provided the screeches and meows for Tom. He would continue to do so until &quot;Sufferin Cats&quot; (1943). Beginning with the short &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; (1941), co-creator William Hanna provided the vocal effects and famous screams for the character until the last Hanna-Barbera short &quot;Tot Watchers&quot; (1958). This was accomplished by someone recording him screaming, chopping the top and bottom of it, leaving the strongest part of the recording in. During this time period, Lang continued doing vocal effects for Tom and occasionally did his speaking voice between 1943 and 1946. Billy Bletcher also voiced him in a few shorts between 1944 and 1950. In 1961–1962, when Gene Deitch took over as director after the MGM cartoon studio shut down in 1957, he and Allen Swift did vocal effects for Tom throughout that time period. When Chuck Jones took over during 1963–1967, Mel Blanc (best known for voicing Bugs Bunny and other characters) and June Foray voiced Tom. Terence Monk did his singing voice in &quot;The Cat Above and the Mouse Below&quot; (1964) and &quot;Cat and Dupli-cat&quot; (1967).

In &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (1975), Tom was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot; in 1980–1982. Frank Welker voiced him in &quot;Tom and Jerry Kids&quot; in 1990–1993. Other voice actors include Richard Kind (in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;), Jeff Bergman (in a Cartoon Network Latin America bumper and a Boomerang UK bumper), Alan Marriott (in &quot;Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry&quot;), Jeff Bennett (in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring&quot;), Marc Silk (in &quot;Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers&quot;), Bill Kopp (in &quot;Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry&quot;), Spike Brandt (in &quot;The Karate Guard&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s Giant Adventure&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz&quot;, and &quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;), and Don Brown (in &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot;). In &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)&quot;, his vocal effects are provided by the show&#x27;s sound designer Rich Danhakl and archival recordings of William Hanna from the original theatrical shorts. In &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry (2021 film)&quot;, his voice was provided by Kaiji Tang and archived recordings of William Hanna.

On November 18, 2021, it was confirmed that Eric Bauza would be voicing the character in the 2022 fighting game, &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, which establishes Tom&#x27;s original given name &quot;Jasper&quot; to be his middle name. Additionally, William Hanna&#x27;s archival audio recordings (usually Tom&#x27;s iconic screams as a death scream sound) are also used in the game. In Cartoon Network in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, Tom was voiced by Megumi Aratake.

==In popular culture==
Tom&#x27;s screams have been used as stock sound effects in various media, such as the 1981 James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Critters 2&quot; and &quot;Critters 3&quot; (used for the Critters when they scream and shriek) and the &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; episode, &quot;Small Stuff&quot; (used for Jang Keng, a black cat). It was also used for the caveman in the 1995 game &quot;Prehistorik Man&quot;.

Tom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot; from the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

&quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; parodies &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, with its cat character Scratchy, unlike Tom, usually being portrayed as a harmless character who is subject to wanton unprovoked graphic violence by the psychopathic Itchy.

The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei likened the rivalry between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tom and Jerry, with the United States in the role of Tom.

<text>William Henry Vanderbilt (May 8, 1821 – December 8, 1885) was an American businessman Known as &quot;Billy&quot;, he was the eldest son of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, an heir to his fortune and a prominent member of the Vanderbilt family. Vanderbilt became the richest American after he took over his father&#x27;s fortune in 1877 until his own death in 1885, passing on a substantial part of the fortune to his wife and children, particularly to his sons Cornelius II and William. He inherited nearly $100 million from his father. The fortune had doubled when he died fewer than nine years later.

==Early life==
&quot;Billy&quot; Vanderbilt was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on May 8, 1821, to Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and Sophia Johnson.

His father Cornelius frequently berated and criticized him, calling his eldest son a &quot;blockhead&quot; and a &quot;blatherskite&quot;. Billy longed to show his father that he was not, in fact, a blatherskite, but never dared stand up to the Commodore. A major turning point in their relationship occurred on the family trip to Europe on the steamship &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; in 1860, after which the two became very close and Billy was given a greater role in business matters.

He matriculated at Columbia College with the class of 1841 but did not graduate, according to official records.

==Career==

His father carefully oversaw his business training, starting him out at age 19 as a clerk in a New York banking house. After joining as an executive of the Staten Island Railway, he was made its president in 1862 and three years later was appointed vice-president of the Hudson River railway.

In 1869, he was made vice-president of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, becoming its president in 1877. He took over for his father as president of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, the Canada Southern Railway, and the Michigan Central Railroad at the time of the Commodore&#x27;s death.

Vanderbilt&#x27;s railroad holdings included Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, the Chicago and Canada Southern Railway, the Detroit and Bay City Railroad, the Hudson River Railroad, the Hudson River Bridge, the Joliet and Northern Indiana Railroad, the Michigan Midland and Canada Railroad, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, the New York Central Sleeping Car Company, the New York and Harlem Rail Road, the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad, and the Staten Island Rail-Road.

=== &quot;Public be damned!&quot; ===
In 1883, reporter John Dickinson Sherman questioned him about why he ran the limited express train: &quot;Do your limited express trains pay or do you run them for the accommodation of the public?&quot; Vanderbilt responded with: &quot;Accommodation of the public? The public be damned! We run them because we have to. They do not pay. We have tried again and again to get the different roads to give them up; but they will run them and, of course, as long as they run them we must do the same.&quot; The interview was then published in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, but Vanderbilt&#x27;s words were modified. Several accounts of the incident were then disseminated; the accounts vary in terms of who conducted the interview, under what circumstance and what was actually said. Vanderbilt received bad publicity and clarified his response with a subsequent interview by the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;. In that interview he was quoted saying: &quot;Railroads are not run for the public benefit, but to pay. Incidentally, we may benefit humanity, but the aim is to earn a dividend.&quot;

===Ulysses S. Grant===
In 1884, the firm &quot;Grant &amp; Ward&quot; went bankrupt and ruined the investments of both Ulysses S. Grant and Vanderbilt, whom Grant had convinced to invest $150,000. Ferdinand Ward, known as the &quot;Napoleon of Wall Street,&quot; had, unknowingly to both Grant and Vanderbilt, operated the company as a Ponzi scheme that resulted in financial ruin for many. The other associate, Grant&#x27;s son Buck Grant, apparently was unaware of Ward&#x27;s Ponzi scheme swindle. Ward was later prosecuted. To pay Vanderbilt back, Grant mortgaged his Civil War memorabilia, including his sword. Although this did not fully cover the $150,000 debt, Vanderbilt accepted the memorabilia as payment and wiped out the $150,000 debt owed by Grant. Vanderbilt later recouped Grant&#x27;s other mortgaged war memorabilia, including the memorabilia given by Grant, and returned them to Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s wife, Julia Grant, after Grant&#x27;s death in 1885.

==Personal life==

In 1841, Billy married Maria Louisa Kissam (1821–1896), daughter of the Reverend Samuel Kissam and Margaret Hamilton Adams. Together, they had nine children:

# Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899) who married Alice Claypoole Gwynne; they were the parents of Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt as well as Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and paternal grandparents of Gloria Laura Vanderbilt.
# Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt (1845–1924) who married Elliott Fitch Shepard in 1868; they were the parents of Alice Vanderbilt Shepard and Elliott Fitch Shepard Jr.
# Allen William Vanderbilt (1846–1847) who died at age 11 months.
# William Kissam Vanderbilt (1849–1920) who married (1) Alva Erskine Smith and (2) Anne Harriman Sands Rutherfurd.
# Emily Thorn Vanderbilt (1852–1946) who married William Douglas Sloane (1844–1915) and later Ambassador Henry White.
# Florence Adele Vanderbilt (1854–1952) who married Hamilton McKown Twombly.
# Frederick William Vanderbilt (1856–1938) who married Louise Anthony Torrance.
# Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt (1860–1936) who married William Seward Webb.
# George Washington Vanderbilt II (1862–1914) who married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser.
In 1883, he resigned all his company presidencies and had his sons appointed as important chairmen but left the day-to-day running of the businesses to experienced men appointed president.

Vanderbilt died on December 8, 1885, in Manhattan, New York City, suffering a stroke during an appointment with Baltimore and Ohio Railroad president Robert Garrett. He was interred in the Vanderbilt Family Mausoleum that he had commissioned in New Dorp on Staten Island, New York. His estate was divided among his eight surviving children and his wife, the bulk of the estate going to his eldest two sons, Cornelius and William. His youngest son George inherited his Staten Island mansion and farm, which became Miller Field airbase and parkland.

=== Philanthropy and legacy ===
Vanderbilt was an active philanthropist who gave extensively to a number of philanthropic causes including the YMCA; funding to help establish the Metropolitan Opera (which was not an entirely selfless act; his and other New York &quot;new money&quot; families had been socially excluded from the New York Academy of Music and set up the Metropolitan as competition); and an endowment for the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He donated a large amount to complete the McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia. In 1880, he provided the money for Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to construct the Wesley Hall building for use as the Biblical Department and library and included lecture halls and 160 dormitory rooms for students and professors, as well as a cafeteria. The building was destroyed by fire in 1932 and his son Frederick made another donation to help cover the insurance shortfall and allow a new building to be constructed.

Vanderbilt was an avid art enthusiast; his collection included some of the most valuable works of the Old Masters, and over his lifetime Vanderbilt acquired more than 200 paintings, which he housed in his lavish and palatial Fifth Avenue mansion.

<text>A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages but suppresses any voltage common to the two inputs. It is an analog circuit with two inputs formula_1 and formula_2 and one output formula_3, in which the output is ideally proportional to the difference between the two voltages:
: formula_4 
where formula_5 is the gain of the amplifier.

Single amplifiers are usually implemented by either adding the appropriate feedback resistors to a standard op-amp, or with a dedicated integrated circuit containing internal feedback resistors. It is also a common sub-component of larger integrated circuits handling analog signals.

== Mathematics of the amplifier ==
: formula_6

where formula_2 and formula_1 are the input voltages, and formula_9 is the differential gain.

In practice, however, the gain is not quite equal for the two inputs. This means, for instance, that if formula_2 and formula_1 are equal, the output will not be zero, as it would be in the ideal case. A more realistic expression for the output of a differential amplifier thus includes a second term:

: formula_12

where formula_13 is called the common-mode gain of the amplifier.

As differential amplifiers are often used to null out noise or bias voltages that appear at both inputs, a low common-mode gain is usually desired.

The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), usually defined as the ratio between differential-mode gain and common-mode gain, indicates the ability of the amplifier to accurately cancel voltages that are common to both inputs. The common-mode rejection ratio is defined as

: formula_14

In a perfectly symmetric differential amplifier, formula_13 is zero, and the CMRR is infinite. Note that a differential amplifier is a more general form of amplifier than one with a single input; by grounding one input of a differential amplifier, a single-ended amplifier results.

==Long-tailed pair==

===Historical background===

Modern differential amplifiers are usually implemented with a basic two-transistor circuit called a &quot;“long-tailed” pair&quot; or &quot;differential pair&quot;. This circuit was originally implemented using a pair of vacuum tubes. The circuit works the same way for all three-terminal devices with current gain. The bias points of “long-tail” resistor circuit are largely determined by Ohm&#x27;s law and less so by active-component characteristics.

The long-tailed pair was developed from earlier knowledge of push–pull circuit techniques and measurement bridges. An early circuit which closely resembles a long-tailed pair was published by British neurophysiologist Bryan Matthews in 1934, and it seems likely that this was intended to be a true long-tailed pair but was published with a drawing error. The earliest definite long-tailed pair circuit appears in a patent submitted by Alan Blumlein in 1936. By the end of the 1930s the topology was well established and had been described by various authors, including Frank Offner (1937), Otto Schmitt (1937) and Jan Friedrich Toennies (1938), and it was particularly used for detection and measurement of physiological impulses.

The long-tailed pair was very successfully used in early British computing, most notably the Pilot ACE model and descendants, Maurice Wilkes’ EDSAC, and probably others designed by people who worked with Blumlein or his peers. The long-tailed pair has many favorable attributes if used as a switch: largely immune to tube (transistor) variations (of great importance when machines contained 1,000 tubes or more), high gain, gain stability, high input impedance, medium/low output impedance, good clipper (with a not-too-long tail), non-inverting (&quot;EDSAC contained no inverters!&quot;) and large output voltage swings. One disadvantage is that the output voltage swing (typically ±10–20 V) was imposed upon a high DC voltage (200 V or so), requiring care in signal coupling, usually some form of wide-band DC coupling. Many computers of this time tried to avoid this problem by using only AC-coupled pulse logic, which made them very large and overly complex (ENIAC: 18,000 tubes for a 20-digit calculator) or unreliable. DC-coupled circuitry became the norm after the first generation of vacuum-tube computers.

=== Configurations ===

A differential (long-tailed, emitter-coupled) pair amplifier consists of two amplifying stages with common (emitter, source or cathode) degeneration.

==== Differential output ====

With two inputs and two outputs, this forms a differential amplifier stage (Figure 2). The two bases (or grids or gates) are inputs which are differentially amplified (subtracted and multiplied) by the transistor pair; they can be fed with a differential (balanced) input signal, or one input could be grounded to form a phase splitter circuit. An amplifier with differential output can drive a floating load or another stage with differential input.

==== Single-ended output ====
If the differential output is not desired, then only one output can be used (taken from just one of the collectors (or anodes or drains), disregarding the other output; this configuration is referred to as &quot;single-ended output&quot;. The gain is half that of the stage with differential output. To avoid sacrificing gain, a differential to single-ended converter can be utilized. This is often implemented as a current mirror (Figure 3, below).

==== Single-ended input ====

The differential pair can be used as an amplifier with a single-ended input if one of the inputs is grounded or fixed to a reference voltage (usually, the other collector is used as a single-ended output) This arrangement can be thought of as cascaded common-collector and common-base stages or as a buffered common-base stage.

The emitter-coupled amplifier is compensated for temperature drifts, VBE is cancelled, and the Miller effect and transistor saturation are avoided. That is why it is used to form emitter-coupled amplifiers (avoiding Miller effect), phase splitter circuits (obtaining two inverse voltages), ECL gates and switches (avoiding transistor saturation), etc.

=== Operation ===

To explain the circuit operation, four particular modes are isolated below although, in practice, some of them act simultaneously and their effects are superimposed.

==== Biasing ====

In contrast with classic amplifying stages that are biased from the side of the base (and so they are highly β-dependent), the differential pair is directly biased from the side of the emitters by sinking/injecting the total quiescent current. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their VBE voltages (base currents) to pass the quiescent current through their collector-emitter junctions. So, due to the negative feedback, the quiescent current depends only slightly on the transistor&#x27;s β.

The biasing base currents needed to evoke the quiescent collector currents usually come from the ground, pass through the input sources and enter the bases. So, the sources have to be galvanic (DC) to ensure paths for the biasing current and low resistive enough to not create significant voltage drops across them. Otherwise, additional DC elements should be connected between the bases and the ground (or the positive power supply).

==== Common mode ====

In common mode (the two input voltages change in the same directions), the two voltage (emitter) followers cooperate with each other working together on the common high-resistive emitter load (the &quot;long tail&quot;). They all together increase or decrease the voltage of the common emitter point (figuratively speaking, they together &quot;pull up&quot; or &quot;pull down&quot; it so that it moves). In addition, the dynamic load &quot;helps&quot; them by changing its instant ohmic resistance in the same direction as the input voltages (it increases when the voltage increases and vice versa.) thus keeping up constant total resistance between the two supply rails. There is a full (100%) negative feedback; the two input base voltages and the emitter voltage change simultaneously while the collector currents and the total current do not change. As a result, the output collector voltages do not change as well.

==== Differential mode ====

Normal. In differential mode (the two input voltages change in opposite directions), the two voltage (emitter) followers oppose each other—while one of them tries to increase the voltage of the common emitter point, the other tries to decrease it (figuratively speaking, one of them &quot;pulls up&quot; the common point while the other &quot;pulls down&quot; it so that it stays immovable) and vice versa. So, the common point does not change its voltage; it behaves like a virtual ground with a magnitude determined by the common-mode input voltages. The high-resistance emitter element does not play any role—it is shunted by the other low-resistance emitter follower. There is no negative feedback, since the emitter voltage does not change at all when the input base voltages change. The common quiescent current vigorously steers between the two transistors and the output collector voltages vigorously change. The two transistors mutually ground their emitters; so, although they are common-collector stages, they actually act as common-emitter stages with maximum gain. Bias stability and independence from variations in device parameters can be improved by negative feedback introduced via cathode/emitter resistors with relatively small resistances.

Overdriven. If the input differential voltage changes significantly (more than about a hundred millivolts), the transistor driven by the lower input voltage turns off and its collector voltage reaches the positive supply rail. At high overdrive the base-emitter junction gets reversed. The other transistor (driven by the higher input voltage) drives all the current. If the resistor at the collector is relatively large, the transistor will saturate. With relatively small collector resistor and moderate overdrive, the emitter can still follow the input signal without saturation. This mode is used in differential switches and ECL gates.

Breakdown. If the input voltage continues increasing and exceeds the base-emitter breakdown voltage, the base-emitter junction of the transistor driven by the lower input voltage breaks down. If the input sources are low resistive, an unlimited current will flow directly through the &quot;diode bridge&quot; between the two input sources and will damage them.

&quot;In common mode, the emitter voltage follows the input voltage variations; there is a full negative feedback and the gain is minimum. In differential mode, the emitter voltage is fixed (equal to the instant common input voltage); there is no negative feedback and the gain is maximum.&quot;

=== Differential amplifier improvements ===

==== Collector current mirror ====

The collector resistors can be replaced by a current mirror (the top blue section in Fig. 3), whose output part acts as an active load. Thus the differential collector current signal is converted to a single-ended voltage signal without the intrinsic 50% losses, so the gain is doubled. This is achieved by copying the input collector current from the left to the right side, where the magnitudes of the two input signals add. For this purpose, the input of the current mirror is connected to the left output, and the output of the current mirror is connected to the right output of the differential amplifier.

The current mirror copies the left collector current and passes it through the right transistor that produces the right collector current. At this right output of the differential amplifier, the two signal currents (pos. and neg. current changes) are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (Δ&quot;I&quot; − (−Δ&quot;I&quot;) = 2Δ&quot;I&quot;), and the differential to single-ended conversion is completed without gain losses. Fig. 4 shows the transmission characteristic of this circuit.

==== Emitter constant current source ====
The quiescent current has to be constant to ensure constant collector voltages at common mode. This requirement is not so important in the case of a differential output, since although their two collector voltages will vary simultaneously their difference (the output voltage) will not vary. But in the case of a single-ended output, it is extremely important to keep a constant current since the output collector voltage will vary. Thus the higher the resistance of the current source formula_16 in the original circuit of Fig. 2, the lower (better) is the common-mode gain formula_17.

The constant current needed could be produced by connecting an element (resistor) with very high resistance between the shared emitter node and the supply rail (negative for NPN and positive for PNP transistors), but that requires a high supply voltage. So in more sophisticated designs, an element with high differential (dynamic) resistance approximating a constant current source/sink (the bottom of Fig. 3) is substituted for the “long tail”. It is usually implemented by a current mirror because of its high compliance voltage (small voltage drop across the output transistor).

=== Interfacing considerations ===

==== Floating input source ====

It is possible to connect a floating source between the two bases, but it is necessary to ensure paths for the biasing base currents. In the case of galvanic source, only one resistor has to be connected between one of the bases and the ground. The biasing current will enter directly this base and indirectly (through the input source) the other one. If the source is capacitive, two resistors have to be connected between the two bases and the ground to ensure different paths for the base currents.

==== Input/output impedance ====

The input impedance of the differential pair highly depends on the input mode. At common mode, the two parts behave as common-collector stages with high emitter loads; so, the input impedances are extremely high. At differential mode, they behave as common-emitter stages with grounded emitters; so, the input impedances are low.

The output impedance of the differential pair is high (especially for the improved differential pair with a current mirror as shown in Figure 3).

==== Input/output range ====

The common-mode input voltage can vary between the two supply rails but cannot closely reach them since some voltage drops (minimum 1 volt) have to remain across the output transistors of the two current mirrors.

== Operational amplifier as differential amplifier ==

An operational amplifier, or op-amp, is a differential amplifier with very high differential-mode gain, very high input impedance, and low output impedance. An op-amp differential amplifier can be built with predictable and stable gain by applying &quot;negative&quot; feedback (Figure 5). Some kinds of differential amplifier usually include several simpler differential amplifiers. For example, a fully differential amplifier, an instrumentation amplifier, or an isolation amplifier are often built from a combination of several op-amps.

== Applications ==

Differential amplifiers are found in many circuits that utilize series negative feedback (op-amp follower, non-inverting amplifier, etc.), where one input is used for the input signal, the other for the feedback signal (usually implemented by operational amplifiers). For comparison, the old-fashioned inverting single-ended op-amps from the early 1940s could realize only parallel negative feedback by connecting additional resistor networks (an op-amp inverting amplifier is the most popular example). A common application is for the control of motors or servos, as well as for signal amplification applications. In discrete electronics, a common arrangement for implementing a differential amplifier is the long-tailed pair, which is also usually found as the differential element in most op-amp integrated circuits. A long-tailed pair can be used as an analog multiplier with the differential voltage as one input and the biasing current as another. 

A differential amplifier is used as the input stage emitter coupled logic gates and as switch. When used as a switch, the &quot;left&quot; base/grid is used as signal input and the &quot;right&quot; base/grid is grounded; output is taken from the right collector/plate. When the input is zero or negative, the output is close to zero (but can be not saturated); when the input is positive, the output is most-positive, dynamic operation being the same as the amplifier use described above.

The differential amplifier is used in the cathode follower oscillator. The advantages are high impedance of the differential amplifier input and output and small phase shift between input and output. This application uses only one input and one output of the differential amplifier.

=== Symmetrical feedback network eliminates common-mode gain and common-mode bias ===

In case the operational amplifier&#x27;s (non-ideal) input bias current or differential input impedance are a significant effect, one can select a feedback network that improves the effect of common-mode input signal and bias. In Figure 6, current generators model the input bias current at each terminal; &quot;I&quot;+b and &quot;I&quot;−b represent the input bias current at terminals &quot;V&quot;+ and &quot;V&quot;− respectively.

The Thévenin equivalent for the network driving the &quot;V&quot;+ terminal has a voltage &quot;V&quot;+&#x27; and impedance &quot;R&quot;+&#x27;:
: formula_18
while for the network driving the &quot;V&quot;− terminal:
: formula_19
The output of the op-amp is just the open-loop gain &quot;A&quot;ol times the differential input current &quot;i&quot; times the differential input impedance 2&quot;R&quot;d, therefore
: formula_20
where &quot;R&quot;|| is the average of &quot;R&quot;+|| and &quot;R&quot;−||.

These equations undergo a great simplification if 
: formula_21
resulting in the relation
: formula_22
which implies that the closed-loop gain for the differential signal is &quot;V&quot;+in − &quot;V&quot;−in, but the common-mode gain is identically zero. 

It also implies that the common-mode input bias current has cancelled out, leaving only the input offset current &quot;I&quot;Δb = &quot;I&quot;+b − &quot;I&quot;−b still present, and with a coefficient of &quot;R&quot;i. It is as if the input offset current is equivalent to an input offset voltage acting across an input resistance &quot;R&quot;i, which is the source resistance of the feedback network into the input terminals.

Finally, as long as the open-loop voltage gain &quot;A&quot;ol is much larger than unity, the closed-loop voltage gain is &quot;R&quot;f/&quot;R&quot;i, the value one would obtain through the rule-of-thumb analysis known as &quot;virtual ground&quot;.

<doc id="326652" wikidata="Q2708289" url="?curid=326652" title="Cornelius Vanderbilt II">
<text>Cornelius &quot;Corneil&quot; Vanderbilt II (November 27, 1843 – September 12, 1899) was an American socialite 
and a member of the prominent United States Vanderbilt family.

==Noted forebears==
He was the favorite grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who bequeathed him $5 million, and the eldest son of William Henry &quot;Billy&quot; Vanderbilt (who bequeathed him about $70 million) and Maria Louisa Kissam. In his turn, he succeeded them as the chairman and the president of the New York Central and related railroad lines in 1885.

==Early life==
Cornelius Vanderbilt II was born on November 27, 1843, on Staten Island, New York to William Henry Vanderbilt (1821–1885) and Maria Louisa Kissam.

==Career==

Vanderbilt established a reputation for a strong work ethic while clerking at the Shoe and Leather Bank in New York City. This endeared him to his grandfather, the &#x27;Commodore,&#x27; who was a strong believer in personal industry.

Vanderbilt was active in numerous organizations, including the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, YMCA, Red Cross, Salvation Army, Trinity Church, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Sunday Breakfast Association, and the Newport Country Club.

==Personal life and death==
On February 4, 1867, he married Alice Claypoole Gwynne (1845–1934), daughter of Abraham Evan Gwynne and Rachel Moore Flagg. The two met at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church where both taught Sunday school.

Together, they had seven children:

* Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt (1869–1874), who died of a childhood illness at the age of five.
* William Henry Vanderbilt II (1870–1892), who died of typhoid fever while attending Yale University. 
* Cornelius &quot;Neily&quot; Vanderbilt III (1873–1942), whom his father disinherited for marrying Grace Graham Wilson (1870–1953) without his approval.
* Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942), who married Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930)
* Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (1877–1915), who died aboard the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and who married Ellen French, and after their divorce, Margaret Emerson (1884–1960).
* Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt (1880–1925), who first married society debutante Cathleen Neilson, and later Gloria Morgan.
* Gladys Moore Vanderbilt (1886–1965), who married Count László Széchenyi (1879–1938).

A stroke in 1896 compelled him to reduce his active business involvement. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage shortly after 6 a.m. on September 12, 1899, at his home on West Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan, New York City.

Upon his death, family leadership passed to his first brother, William Kissam Vanderbilt. His philanthropy had been such that he did not increase the wealth that had been left to him. His estate at the time of his death was appraised at $72,999,867, $20 million of which was real estate. In dollars, $73 million is equivalent to $.

===Real estate===

The Fifth Avenue mansions that Cornelius Vanderbilt II, his brothers, and his sons lived in have been demolished, including Cornelius Vanderbilt II House.

His 70-room summer residence, The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island, still stands as a memory of his lifestyle. It is today operated as a historic house museum.

===Descendants===
Through his son, Reginald, he was the grandfather of Gloria Laura Vanderbilt, the socialite and fashion designer, and the great-grandfather of news anchor Anderson Hays Cooper.

Through his son, Alfred, he was the grandfather of William Henry Vanderbilt III, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., and George Washington Vanderbilt III.

<doc id="326653" wikidata="Q578789" url="?curid=326653" title="Higher Superstition">
<text>Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science is a 1994 book about the philosophy of science by the biologist Paul R. Gross and the mathematician Norman Levitt.

==Summary==

Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the &quot;academic left&quot; from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals.

Topics discussed include: cultural constructivism or social constructivism, the strong programme, the science criticism of Stanley Aronowitz and Bruno Latour, post-modernism and deconstructionism and their influence on American academia, the science criticism of Andrew Ross, feminist science criticism, environmentalist science criticism and &quot;apocalyptic naturism&quot;, Jeremy Rifkin&#x27;s influential &quot;pseudoscientific alarmism&quot;, attacks on medical research connected with AIDS activism and animal rights advocacy, and Afrocentrism. The book also questions human activity&#x27;s relationship with climate change. The authors find it unfortunate that social scientists and literary critics often consider themselves qualified to criticize the natural sciences without learning much about them in detail, and worry about what would replace Enlightenment ideals of universalism and rationalism, and objective truths about the natural world as ascertained by a scientific methodology of repeatable experiments, if these were to be discredited, as many science critics in the humanities wish to do.

==Reception and influence==
The book inspired the 1996 Sokal hoax, in which Alan Sokal published a bogus paper in Social Text, a postmodernist journal that did not peer-review submissions. Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about &quot;Higher Superstition&quot;, he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levitt criticized that they were describing them fairly in &quot;about 80 percent of the cases&quot;.

The book has been criticized by Historian of Science Norton Wise. In a review of the book for the History of Science journal Isis, he dismisses the authors critique as misunderstanding what postmodernism, feminist studies, and social constructivism entail. He regards their writings as an awkward attempt at portraying history of science as a complacent teleological story devoid of any cultural influence and states that the author&#x27;s demands for people who study science to be competent in the natural sciences is understandable but odd, given their own incompetence in historical research and writing.

<doc id="326656" wikidata="Q1063438" url="?curid=326656" title="Crappie">
<text>Crappies () are two species of North American freshwater fish of the genus Pomoxis in the family Centrarchidae (sunfishes). Both species of crappies are popular game fish among recreational anglers.

== Etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Pomoxis&quot; literally means &quot;sharp cover&quot;, referring to the fish&#x27;s spiny gill covers (opercular bones). It is composed of the Greek (, cover) and (, &quot;sharp&quot;).

The common name (also spelled &quot;croppie&quot; or &quot;crappé&quot;) derives from the Canadian French , which refers to many different fishes of the sunfish family. Other names for crappie are papermouths, strawberry bass, speckled bass or specks (especially in Michigan), speckled perch, white perch, crappie bass, calico bass (throughout the Middle Atlantic states and New England), and Oswego bass.

In Louisiana, it is called sacalait (, ), seemingly an allusion to its milky white flesh or silvery skin. The supposed French meaning is, however, folk etymology, because the word is ultimately from Choctaw , meaning &quot;trout&quot;.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
== Biology ==
Both species of crappie as adults feed predominantly on smaller fish species, including the young of their own predators (which include the northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye). They have diverse diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans. Larval crappies rely on crustacean zooplankton as a food source. The availability of zooplankton can have an effect on larval populations. By day, crappie tend to be less active and concentrate around weed beds or submerged objects, such as logs and boulders. They feed during dawn and dusk, by moving into open water or approaching the shore.

Hybrid crappie (&quot;Pomoxis annularis&quot; × &quot;nigromaculatus&quot;) have been cultured and occur naturally. The crossing of a black crappie female and white crappie male has better survival and growth rates among offspring than the reciprocal cross does. Hybrid crappie are difficult to distinguish from black crappie by appearance alone. Fingerling yields are variable in culture. The hybrid offspring are fertile, black crappie female and white crappie male crosses more so than the reciprocal.

==Fishing==

The &quot;Pomoxis&quot; species are highly regarded panfish and are often considered to be among the best-tasting freshwater food fish. Because of their diverse diets, crappie may be caught in many ways, including casting light jigs, trolling with minnows or soft lures, using small spinnerbaits, or using bobbers with common hookbaits. Crappies are also popular with ice anglers, as they are active in winter. 

===Angling===

Angling for crappie is popular throughout much of North America. Methods vary, but among the most popular is called &quot;spider rigging&quot;, a method characterized by a fisherman in a boat with many long fishing rods pointing away from the angler at various angles like spokes from a wheel (spider rigging is not permitted on some waters. In Minnesota, for example, a fisherman may use only one rod during the open water season). Anglers who employ the spider rigging method may choose from among many popular baits, some of the most popular are plastic jigs with lead jigheads, crankbaits or live minnows. Many anglers also chum or dump live groundbait into the water to attract the fish to bite their bait. Crappies are also regularly targeted and caught during the spawning period by fly fishermen, and can be taken from frozen ponds and lakes in winter by ice fishing.

===Conservation===
In 2023, apparel company Crappie Forever announced a promotion in which it would award prizes to those catching and releasing tagged crappie in certain Mississippi lakes, in order to further crappie conservation and enthusiasm for tournament fishing.

===Commercial fishing===
Before state fisheries departments began to implement more restrictive, conservation-minded regulations, a great number of crappies, especially in the Mississippi River states, were harvested commercially in the 19th and early 20th centuries. At one point, the annual crappie catch sold at fish markets in the United States was reported to be about .

A commercial fishery for crappies existed at Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee until 2003. It was one of the few commercial fisheries for crappies in recent decades.

==Fishing records==
According to the International Game Fish Association, the current all-tackle world records are:

* Black crappie: , caught by Lionel &quot;Jam&quot; Ferguson at Richeison Pond in Tennessee on 15 May 2018
* White crappie: , caught by Fred Brigh at Enid Dam, Mississippi on 31 July 1957

<text>The Spanish sparrow or willow sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis) is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. It is found in the Mediterranean region and south-west and central Asia. It is very similar to the closely related house sparrow, and the two species show their close relation in a &quot;biological mix-up&quot; of hybridisation in the Mediterranean region, which complicates the taxonomy of this species.

== Description ==

The Spanish sparrow is a rather large sparrow, at in length, and in weight. It is slightly larger and heavier than house sparrows, and also has a slightly longer and stouter bill. The male is similar to the house sparrow in plumage, but differs in that its underparts are heavily streaked with black, has a chestnut rather than grey crown, and has white rather than grey cheeks. The female is effectively inseparable from the house sparrow in its basic plumage, which is grey-brown overall but more boldly marked. The female has light streaking on its sides, a pale cream supercilium, and broad cream streaks on its back.

Two subspecies of the Spanish sparrow – the western Spanish sparrow (&quot;P. h. hispaniolensis&quot;) and eastern Spanish sparrow (&quot;P. h. transcaspicus&quot;) – are recognised, with little visible difference between them in worn breeding plumage. They are more easily distinguished in fresh winter plumage, with the eastern subspecies &quot;P. h. transcaspicus&quot; being paler with less chestnut.

=== Voice ===

The Spanish sparrow&#x27;s vocalisations are similar to those of the house sparrow. The male gives a call somewhat different from that of the house sparrow when displaying at its nest. This call is a pair of strident, disyllabic chirps, similar to those of the house sparrow, but louder and high-pitched, transcribed as &#x27;. A similar call, softer and more like the house sparrow&#x27;s &#x27;, is used by birds arriving or departing at roosting sites. The Spanish sparrow&#x27;s other calls are almost the same as those of the house sparrow. A soft &#x27; is given at the nest by mated pairs, a &#x27; flight call is given by flocking birds, and a &quot;&quot; call is given as a threat.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

Its taxonomy is greatly complicated by the &quot;biological mix-up&quot; it forms with the house sparrow in the Mediterranean. In most of the Mediterranean, one or both of the two species occurs, with only a limited degree of hybridisation. On the Italian Peninsula and Corsica, the two species are replaced by the Italian sparrow, a puzzling type of sparrow apparently intermediate between the Spanish sparrow and the house sparrow.

The Italian sparrow has been classified as a hybrid between the Spanish sparrow and the house sparrow, a subspecies of the Spanish sparrow, a subspecies of the house sparrow and/or a separate species. The Spanish sparrow also hybridises freely with the house sparrow in parts of North Africa (northeastern Algeria, Tunisia, and northwestern Libya), forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure Spanish sparrows. On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, Gozo, Crete, Rhodes and Karpathos, there are more apparently intermediate birds of unknown status.

The Spanish sparrow was first described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck as &quot;Fringilla hispaniolensis&quot;, from a specimen collected at Algeciras, in southern Spain. The usual English name refers to the description of the species from Spain. The name &quot;willow sparrow&quot;, referring to the moist habitat of this bird, is sometimes used, especially when the Italian sparrow is considered the same species. The genus name &quot;Passer&quot; is the Latin word for sparrow, and &quot;hispaniolensis&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;Spanish&quot;.

Two subspecies of Spanish sparrow are usually recognised, the western nominate subspecies &quot;hispaniolensis&quot;, and the eastern &quot;transcaspicus&quot;, described by Austrian ornithologist Viktor von Tschusi zu Schmidhoffen in 1902 from Ýolöten, Turkmenistan. Birds in Anatolia and Cyprus are usually considered to belong to &quot;P. h. transcaspicus&quot;, but birds as far east as Ceylanpınar have been noted as intermediates and the difference between the two subspecies may actually be clinal.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Spanish sparrow has a highly complex distribution in the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia, and southwest to central Asia. It breeds mostly in a band of latitude about 15 degrees wide, from the Danube Valley and the Aral Sea in the north to Libya and central Iran in the south. Its range has expanded greatly by natural colonisation over the last two centuries, in the Balkans, where it reached Romania, Serbia, and Moldova from 1950 onwards; and in Macaronesia, where its range expansion has been attributed to introductions and travel by ship, but was more likely natural colonisation by migrating birds. Vagrants occur widely, as far north as Scotland and Norway.

A study has shown that vagrant individuals tend to occur very close to railway lines, much closer than with other vagrant passerines. This results suggests that Spanish sparrows&#x27; vagrancy and expansion may be facilitated in part by cargo trains.
=== Subspecies &quot;hispaniolensis&quot; ===

The western subspecies &quot;hispaniolensis&quot; breeds in parts of Iberia and North Africa, some islands, and the Balkans. In Iberia it is uncommon, occurring in the Tagus valley and sporadically in the northern meseta, the eastern coast, and in the Guadalquivir and Guadiana valleys. While the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow form a &quot;hybrid swarm&quot; in the eastern half of the Maghreb, they coexist with little hybridisation in the western half. In northern Italy and Corsica, the Spanish sparrow is replaced by the Italian sparrow and the two intergrade in southern Italy, as well as Malta, Crete and nearby islands such as Rhodes. The Spanish sparrow is not known to breed in the Balearic Islands, the Aegean Islands, Corfu or the Peloponnese, but it occurs on Sardinia, Pantelleria and smaller islands near the coast. In the Balkans, it occurs patchily from Montenegro across into the Danube Valley of Romania and northern Serbia. It is found in mainland Greece and Bulgaria, where it is also uncommon.

The Spanish sparrow is likely to have been established on the western Canary Islands for some time, as it was found on Lanzarote when a naturalist first visited the island in 1828. In the 1830s, it was recorded on Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and Tenerife and since the 1940s it has reached all the other islands. It reached Madeira in May 1935, when numbers of sparrows were found across the island after nine days of strong, continuous easterly winds. It seems to have reached Cape Verde around the same time it reached the Canaries and it was first recorded there on Santiago by Charles Darwin in 1832. From then onwards it reached all the other larger islands, in a poorly recorded extension of its range.

=== Subspecies &quot;transcaspicus&quot; ===
The eastern subspecies &quot;transcaspicus&quot; breeds from Anatolia and Cyprus through the Middle East and Central Asia to far western China. In the Middle East, it breeds through Syria and Lebanon to about as far south as Jerusalem. It breeds in eastern Turkey, but is a very rare breeder in Iraq and Kuwait. It breeds sporadically in Azerbaijan and Dagestan, north to the Terek River Valley. In Iran, it breeds in most of the country except the Persian Gulf region, also breeding in central and northern Afghanistan. In Central Asia, it breeds from the regions of the Turkmenistan-Iran and Tajikistan-Afghanistan borders north to parts of the Syr Darya basin in Kazakhstan, and westwards to Lake Alakol, the Karatal River, and a corner of China. Here it has also expanded its range, in the area around Lake Alakol in Kazakhstan, where agriculture was not developed until the 1950s. It winters in the plains of the Indian subcontinent and the Persian Gulf.

=== Habitat ===

In most of its range, the Spanish sparrow occurs alongside the house sparrow. In such areas, both species breed in farmland and open woodland, with the Spanish sparrow preferring moister habitats. In areas where house sparrows are absent, the Spanish sparrow may live in urban habitats, as in the Canary Islands, Madeira, and some Mediterranean islands. In a few urban areas, such as those in eastern Sardinia, the primary sparrow species is the Eurasian tree sparrow. Before the Spanish sparrow arrived in the Canary Islands and Madeira, the rock sparrow was the sole native sparrow. In the Canaries, the Spanish sparrow occurs in most habitats, having ousted the rock sparrow from all but the driest localities. In Madeira the Spanish sparrow is common in cultivated areas, but it has not fully adapted to nesting in buildings or breeding in the drier north of the island. The Spanish sparrow is not common on most of the Cape Verde islands, due to the presence of the endemic Iago sparrow, and the house sparrow on São Vicente. On Fogo, where it is the sole species of sparrow, it is common in all habitats, breeding both in the houses of São Filipe and on the cliff walls of the volcano Pico do Fogo.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The Spanish sparrow is strongly gregarious, flocking and breeding in groups. In the winter, it mostly wanders nomadically or makes regular migrations.

Little is known of the Spanish sparrow&#x27;s survival rate, and the maximum age recorded is 11 years.

=== Feeding ===
Like other sparrows, it feeds principally on the seeds of grains and other grasses, also eating leaves, fruits, and other plant materials. Young birds are fed mostly on insects, and adults also feed on insects and other animals during and before the breeding season. Nestlings are fed almost exclusively on insects for their first few days, and are gradually fed larger amounts of grains. The portion of insects in nestling diets is recorded at a range from 75 to over 90 percent. In preying on insects, the Spanish sparrow is opportunistic, feeding on whichever insects are most common. In Central Asia, these are caterpillars, ants, grasshoppers, and crickets. While migrating through Central Asia in the spring, the Spanish sparrow feeds mostly on crops in cultivated areas, and while breeding it feeds mostly on insects, wild plants, and seeds from the previous year.

===Breeding===

The Spanish sparrow nests in large colonies of closely spaced or even multiple shared nests. Nests are usually placed in trees or bushes, amongst branches or underneath the nests of larger birds such as white storks. Colonies may hold from ten pairs to hundreds of thousands of pairs. Each pair lays 3–8 eggs, which hatch in 12 days, with the chicks fledging when about 14 days old. Males spend more time constructing nests than females.

== Status ==
The European population of the Spanish sparrow comprises between 2,800,000 and 6,200,000 breeding pairs or 8,400,000–18,600,000 individuals. Partly from the European population, the global population is estimated to be between 17 and 74 million individuals. There have been population decreases in some parts of Europe, but in other areas the population has increased and the species is not seriously threatened, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

<text>Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (January 9, 1875 – April 18, 1942) was an American sculptor, art patron and collector, and founder in 1931 of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. She was a prominent social figure and hostess, who was born into the wealthy Vanderbilt family and married into the Whitney family.

==Early life==

Gertrude Vanderbilt was born on January 9, 1875, in New York City, the second daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899) and Alice Claypoole Gwynne (1852–1934), and a great-granddaughter of &quot;Commodore&quot; Cornelius Vanderbilt. Her older sister died before Gertrude was born, but she grew up with several brothers and a younger sister. The family&#x27;s New York City home was an opulent mansion at 742–748 Fifth Avenue., also known as 1 West 57th Street. As a young girl, Gertrude spent her summers in Newport, Rhode Island, at the family&#x27;s summer home, The Breakers, where she kept up with the boys in all their rigorous sporting activities. She was educated by private tutors and at the exclusive Brearley School for women students in New York City. She kept small drawings and watercolor paintings in her personal journals which were her first signs of being interested in the arts.

===Education and early work===

While visiting Europe in the early 1900s, Gertrude Whitney discovered the burgeoning art world of Montmartre and Montparnasse in France. What she saw encouraged her to pursue her creativity and become a sculptor.

She studied at the Art Students League of New York with Hendrik Christian Andersen and James Earle Fraser. Other women students in her classes included Anna Vaughn Hyatt and Malvina Hoffman. In Paris she studied with Andrew O&#x27;Connor and also received criticism from Auguste Rodin. Her training with sculptors of public monuments influenced her later direction. Although her catalogs include numerous smaller sculptures, she is best known today for her monumental works.

Her first public commission was &quot;Aspiration&quot;, a life-size male nude in plaster, which appeared outside the New York State Building at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, in 1901.
Initially she worked under an assumed name, fearing that she would be portrayed as a socialite and her work not taken seriously. Neither her family nor (after her marriage) her husband were supportive of her desire to work seriously as an artist. She once told an artist friend, &quot;Never expect Harry to take your work seriously ... It never has made any difference to him that I feel as I do about art and it never will (except as a source of annoyance).&quot; She believed that a man would have been taken more seriously as an artist, and that her wealth put her in a lose-lose situation: criticized if she took commissions because other artists were more needy, but blamed for undercutting the market for other artists if she was not paid.

In 1907, Whitney established an apartment and studio in Greenwich Village. She also set up a studio in Passy, a fashionable Parisian neighborhood in the XVI arrondissement.

By 1910, she was exhibiting her work publicly under her own name. &quot;Paganisme Immortel&quot;, a statue of a young girl sitting on a rock, with outstretched arms, next to a male figure, was shown at the 1910 National Academy of Design. &quot;Spanish Peasant&quot; was accepted at the Paris Salon in 1911, and &quot;Aztec Fountain&quot; was awarded a bronze medal in 1915 at the San Francisco Exhibition. Her first solo show occurred in New York City in 1916. The first charity exhibition she organized was in 1914 called the &quot;50-50 Art Sale&quot;.

==World War I and its aftermath==
During World War I, Gertrude Whitney dedicated a great deal of her time and money to various relief efforts, establishing and maintaining a fully operational hospital for wounded soldiers in Juilly, about northwest of Paris in France.

While at this hospital, Gertrude Whitney made drawings of the soldiers which became plans for her memorials in New York City. Her work prior to the war had a much less realistic style, which she strayed away from to give the work a more serious feeling. In 1915, her brother Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt perished in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;.

She completed a series of smaller pieces realistically depicting soldiers in wartime, but her smaller works were not seen as particularly significant during her lifetime. Since her death critics have recognized the expert craftsmanship of her smaller works.

In addition to participating in shows with other artists, Whitney held a number of solo exhibitions during her career. These included a show of her wartime sculptures at her Eighth Street Studio in November 1919; a show at the Art Institute of Chicago, March 1 to April 15, 1923; and one in New York City, March 17–28, 1936. The majority of works created in this period of her work were made in her studio in Paris. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a commemorative show of her works in 1943.

===Sculptures from her 1936 show===
===Public sculptures===
Following the end of the War, Whitney was also involved in the creation of a number of commemorative sculptures. During the 1920s her works received critical acclaim both in Europe and the United States, particularly her monumental works. During the 1930s, the popularity of monumental pieces declined. Whitney&#x27;s last pieces of public art were the &quot;Spirit of Flight&quot;, created for the New York World&#x27;s Fair of 1939, and the &quot;Peter Stuyvesant Monument&quot; in New York City.

Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s numerous works in the United States include:
* &quot;Aztec Fountain&quot; – Pan American Union Building, Washington, D.C., 1912
* &quot;Fountain of El Dorado&quot; – 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, San Francisco, California
* Two reliefs on the &quot;Victory Arch&quot; – Madison Square, New York City, 1918–19
* Washington Heights-Inwood War Memorial – Mitchell Square Park, Washington Heights, New York City, erected 1922
* &quot;Buffalo Bill - The Scout&quot;, William F. Cody Memorial – Cody, Wyoming, dedicated 1924
* &quot;Untermyer Memorial&quot;, Woodlawn Cemetery, New York City, 1925 
* &quot;The Founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution&quot;, a memorial honoring the four founders – Constitution Hall, Washington, D.C., dedicated 1929; Whitney was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
* &quot;Titanic&quot; Memorial – Washington, D.C., unveiled 1931
* &quot;Peter Stuyvesant Monument&quot;, New York City, 1936–1939
* &quot;To the Morrow&quot;, vt. &quot;Wings&quot;, vt. &quot;Spirit of Flight&quot;, created for the World&#x27;s Fair in New York, 1939

Whitney&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; Memorial is considered by critics as the most important achievement in her artistic career. The statue was built from a $50,000 prize from a competition that she won in 1914.

Whitney also created works which are now in other countries, including the &quot;American Expeditionary Forces Memorial&quot; in St. Nazaire Harbor in Saint-Nazaire, France (1924). The Government of France purchased a marble replica of the head of the Titanic Memorial, which is now housed in the Musée du Luxembourg.

Whitney sculpted the Christopher Columbus memorial, the Monument to Columbus (also known as &quot;Monument to the Discovery Faith&quot;), in Huelva, Spain (1928–1933). With a cubist style, it is one of her biggest works.

In 1931 Whitney presented the &quot;Caryatid Fountain&quot; to McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The fountain is also referred to as &quot;The Good Will Fountain&quot;, &quot;The Friendship Fountain&quot;, &quot;The Whitney Fountain&quot;, &quot; The Three Graces&quot; and, because it consists of three nude males, &quot;The Three Bares&quot;. There is also a bronze version of this fountain in Washington Square in Lima, Peru.

==Influence in art==

Her great wealth afforded her the opportunity to become a patron of the arts, but she also devoted herself to the advancement of women in art, supporting and exhibiting in women-only shows and ensuring that women were included in mixed shows. She supported exhibition of artwork both locally and around the country, including the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Whitney also donated money to the Society of Independent Artists founded in 1917, which aimed to promote artists who deviated from academic norms. She actively bought works from new artists including the Ashcan School. In 1922, she financed publication of &quot;The Arts&quot; magazine, to prevent its closing. She was the primary financial backer for the &quot;International Composer&#x27;s Guild,&quot; an organization created to promote the performance of modern music.

By 1908, Whitney had opened the &quot;Whitney Studio Gallery&quot; in the same buildings as her own studio on West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. Artists such as Robert Henri and Jo Davidson were invited to showcase their works there. In 1914, Gertrude Whitney also established the &quot;Whitney Studio Club&quot; at 147 West 4th Street, as an artists&#x27; club where young artists could meet and talk, as well as exhibit their works. She provided nearby housing many of them, as well as stipends for living costs at home and abroad. The Whitney Studio Club expanded again when its headquarters were moved back from West Fourth Street to West Eighth Street in 1923. Thus, the club expanded both in size and scope of programming. These early galleries would evolve to become Whitney&#x27;s greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of what is now the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.

In 1929, Whitney offered the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art the donation of her twenty-five-year collection of nearly 700 American modern art works and full payment for building a wing to accommodate these works. Her offer was declined because the museum would not take American art, and in 1931, Whitney decided to create her own museum by renovating and expanding on one of her own studios. Whitney appointed Juliana Force, who was formerly her assistant since 1914, to be the museum&#x27;s first director. The museum aimed to embrace modernism, shifting away from the notions that American art was largely rural and narrow in scope.

A colorful recollection of one of her parties celebrating her artist friends was recounted by the artist Jerome Myers:

Matching it in memory is a party at Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s, on her Long Island estate, the artists there a veritable catalog of celebrities, painters and sculptors. I can hardly visualize, let alone describe, the many shifting scenes of our entertainment: sunken pools and gorgeous white peacocks as line decorations spreading into the gardens; in their swinging cages, brilliant macaws nodding their beaks at George Luks as though they remembered posing for his pictures of them; Robert Chanler showing us his exotic sea pictures, blue-green visions in a marine bathroom; and Mrs. Whitney displaying her studio, the only place on earth in which she could find solitude. Here the artists felt at home, the Whitney hospitality always gracious and sincere.

Her Greenwich Village studio has been named a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, giving it landmark status.

When Whitney died in 1942, the Whitney Museum of American Art was cleared of the debt it owed her and granted $2.5 million of her money.

==Personal life==
Gertrude had a dear friend named Esther in her youth with whom a number of love letters were uncovered which made explicit the desires both had for a physical relationship that surpassed friendship. Esther was the daughter of Richard Morris Hunt, the architect who had built Gertrude&#x27;s family home in New York City and summer home—The Breakers—in Newport, Rhode Island, as well as many of the other Vanderbilts&#x27; mansions. Gertrude considered it one of the &quot;thrills of my life, when Esther kissed me,&quot; and her mother, Alice, was so concerned about the friendship that she forbade Gertrude to see Esther. The separation seemed to have worked; for while Esther continued to write heartbroken letters of longing, Gertrude went on to have a bevy of male beaux.

At age 21, on August 25, 1896, she married the extremely wealthy sportsman Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930). A banker and investor, Whitney was the son of politician William Collins Whitney and Flora Payne, the daughter of former U.S. Senator from Ohio Henry B. Payne, and sister to a Standard Oil Company magnate. Harry Whitney inherited a fortune in oil and tobacco as well as interests in banking. In New York, the couple lived in town houses originally belonging to William Whitney, first at 2 East 57th St., across the street from Gertrude&#x27;s parents, and after William Whitney&#x27;s death, at 871 Fifth Avenue. They also had a country estate in Old Westbury, Long Island. Gertrude and Harry Whitney had three children:
*Flora Payne Whitney (1897–1986)
*Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney (1899–1992)
*Barbara Whitney (1903–1983; 1960, to George W. Headley).

Harry Whitney died of pneumonia in 1930, at age 58, leaving his widow an estate valued at $72 million. In 1934, she was at the center of a highly publicized court battle with her brother Reginald&#x27;s widow, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, for custody of her ten-year-old niece, Gloria Vanderbilt. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney did win custody of her niece at the end of the custody battle.

Gertrude Whitney died on April 18, 1942, at age 67, and was interred next to her husband in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. The reported cause of her death was from a heart condition. Her daughter Flora Whitney Miller assumed her mother&#x27;s duties as head of the Whitney Museum, and was succeeded by her daughter, Flora Miller Biddle.

<text>John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough, (13 April 1926 – 16 October 2014) was a British peer. He was the elder son of the 10th Duke of Marlborough and his wife, the Hon. Alexandra Mary Hilda Cadogan. He was known as &quot;Sunny&quot; after his courtesy title of Earl of Sunderland.

His principal seat was Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, Oxfordshire. He was ranked 224th in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; 2004, with an estimated wealth of £185 million.

==Life and work==
He was educated at Eton College and served seven years in the Life Guards, in which he achieved the rank of captain. In 1972, on inheriting the Dukedom of Marlborough, he assumed the management of Blenheim Palace and the Blenheim estate.

To fund the maintenance of the house, he opened it to visitors and as a film set, and established a number of businesses, including a garden furniture company and a water bottling plant.

He was also active in a range of organisations, including the Thames and Chilterns Tourist Board and Oxford United Football Club. He served as vice-president of the Witney Conservative Association, the local party of David Cameron.

He died in 2014 at the age of 88.

==Marriages and issue==
Marlborough was married four times and had a total of six children, two of whom died in infancy.

Firstly, he married Susan Mary Hornby (1929–2005), daughter of Michael Charles St John Hornby and Nicolette Joan Ward, on 19 October 1951. They divorced in 1961 after having three children:

* John David Ivor Spencer-Churchill, Earl of Sunderland (17 November 1952 – 14 May 1955), a godson of Princess Margaret
* Charles James Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough (24 November 1955); married, firstly, Rebecca Few-Brown on 24 February 1990. They have one son, George, and were divorced in 1998. In 2002, he married Edla Griffiths, with whom he has two children.
* Lady Henrietta Mary Spencer-Churchill (7 October 1958); married German banker Nathan Gelber in 1980 and they were divorced in 1989. They have two sons.

Secondly, on 23 October 1961, he married Athina Onassis (&quot;née&quot; Livanos), former wife of Aristotle Onassis, and daughter of Stavros Livanos. They were divorced in March 1971 and had no children.

Thirdly, on 20 May 1972, he married Countess Rosita Douglas-Stjernorp, daughter of ambassador Count Carl Douglas-Stjernorp and Ottora Haas-Heye. They had three children and were divorced in 2008.

* Lord Richard Spencer-Churchill (born and died 1973)
* Lord Edward Albert Charles Spencer-Churchill (born 1974); married Kimberly Hammerstroem. They had a civil ceremony at Mayfair Library in London on 4 July 2018, followed by a religious ceremony at Blenheim Palace on 7 July. 
* Lady Alexandra Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill (born 1977)

Finally, at the age of 82, Marlborough married Lily Mahtani (&quot;née&quot; Sahni; born c. 1954–57 in Iran) 3 December 2008 in the Private Chapel at Blenheim. There were no children from this marriage.

<doc id="326668" wikidata="Q25961" url="?curid=326668" title="Eurasian skylark">
<text>The Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis) is a passerine bird in the lark family, Alaudidae. It is a widespread species found across Europe and the Palearctic with introduced populations in Australia, New Zealand and on the Hawaiian Islands. It is a bird of open farmland and heath, known for the song of the male, which is delivered in hovering flight from heights of . The sexes are alike. It is streaked greyish-brown above and on the breast and has a buff-white belly.

The female Eurasian skylark builds an open nest in a shallow depression on open ground well away from trees, bushes and hedges. She lays three to five eggs which she incubates for around 11 days. The chicks are fed by both parents but leave the nest after eight to ten days, well before they can fly. They scatter and hide in the vegetation but continue to be fed by the parents until they can fly at 18 to 20 days of age. Nests are subject to high predation rates by larger birds and small mammals. The parents can have several broods in a single season.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Eurasian skylark was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and retains its original binomial name of &quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;. It is one of the four species placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. The genus name is from the Latin &quot;alauda&quot;, &quot;lark&quot;. Pliny thought the word was originally of Celtic origin. The specific &quot;arvensis&quot; is also Latin, and means &quot;of the field&quot;. The results of a molecular phylogenetic study of the lark family Alaudidae published in 2013 suggested that Eurasian skylark is most closely related to the Oriental skylark &quot;Alauda gulgula&quot;.

Formerly, many authorities considered the Japanese skylark as a separate species. It is now usually considered a subspecies of the Eurasian skylark. Alternate names for the Eurasian skylark include northern skylark and sky lark.

===Subspecies===
Eleven subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;A. a. arvensis&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – northern, western and central Europe
* &quot;A. a. sierrae&quot; Weigold, 1913 – Portugal, central and southern Spain
* &quot;A. a. harterti&quot; Whitaker, 1904 – north-western Africa
* &quot;A. a. cantarella&quot; Bonaparte, 1850 – southern Europe from north-eastern Spain to Turkey and the Caucasus
* &quot;A. a. armenica&quot; Bogdanov, 1879 – south-eastern Turkey to Iran
* &quot;A. a. dulcivox&quot; Hume, 1872 – south-eastern European Russia and western Siberia to north-western China and south-western Mongolia
* &quot;A. a. kiborti&quot; Zaliesski, 1917 – southern Siberia, northern and eastern Mongolia and north-eastern China
* &quot;A. a. intermedia&quot; R. Swinhoe, 1863 – north-central Siberia to north-eastern China and Korea
* &quot;A. a. pekinensis&quot; Swinhoe, 1863 – north-eastern Siberia, Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands
* &quot;A. a. lonnbergi&quot; Hachisuka, 1926 – northern Sakhalin Island
* &quot;A. a. japonica&quot; Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1848 – southern Sakhalin Island, southern Kuril Island, Japan and the Ryukyu Islands: the Japanese skylark

Some authorities recognise the subspecies &quot;A. a. scotia&quot; Tschusi, 1903 and &quot;A. a. guillelmi&quot; Witherby, 1921. In the above list &quot;scotia&quot; is included in the nominate subspecies &quot;A. a. arvensis&quot; and &quot;guillelmi&quot; is included in &quot;A. a. sierrae&quot;.

==Description==

The Eurasian skylark is in length. Like most other larks, the Eurasian skylark is a rather dull-looking species, being mainly brown above and paler below. It has a short blunt crest on the head, which can be raised and lowered. In flight it shows a short tail and short broad wings. The tail and the rear edge of the wings are edged with white, which are visible when the bird is flying away, but not if it is heading towards the observer. The male has broader wings than the female. This adaptation for more efficient hovering flight may have evolved because of female Eurasian skylarks&#x27; preference for males that sing and hover for longer periods and so demonstrate that they are likely to have good overall fitness.

It is known for the song of the male, which is delivered in hovering flight from heights of 50 to 100 m, when the singing bird may appear as just a dot in the sky from the ground. The long, unbroken song is a clear, bubbling warble delivered high in the air while the bird is rising, circling or hovering. The song generally lasts two to three minutes, but it tends to last longer later in the mating season, when songs can last for 20 minutes or more. At wind farm sites, male skylarks have been found to sing at higher frequencies as a result of wind turbine noise.

==Distribution and habitat==
This lark breeds across most of Europe and Asia and in the mountains of north Africa. It is mainly resident in the west of its range, but eastern populations are more migratory, moving further south in winter. Even in the milder west of its range, many birds move to lowlands and the coast in winter. Asian birds, subspecies &quot;A. a. pekinensis&quot;, appear as vagrants in Alaska.

===Introduced populations===
In the 19th century multiple batches of Eurasian skylarks were released in New Zealand beginning in 1864 in Nelson (in the South Island) and in 1867 in Auckland (in the North Island). The wild population increased rapidly and had spread throughout both the North and South Islands by the 1920s.

In Australia the Eurasian skylark was introduced on multiple occasions beginning in 1850. It is now widespread in the southeast of the continent. In New South Wales it mostly occurs south of 33°S. It is widespread throughout Victoria and Tasmania and also occurs in the south-eastern corner of South Australia around Adelaide.

The Eurasian skylark was introduced to the southeastern Hawaiian Islands beginning in 1865. Although once common, it has declined in abundance on Oahu and is no longer found on Kauai. A study published in 1986 found European skylarks remained only on the islands of Hawaii and Maui and estimated a total population of 10,000 individuals.

The Eurasian skylark was introduced to Vancouver Island off the west coast of Canada in 1903; additional birds were introduced in 1913. The population grew and by 1962 there were around 1000 individuals. The numbers have subsequently declined due to loss of habitat, and in 2007 there were estimated to be only around 100 individuals spread over four small areas of the Saanich Peninsula.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Eurasian skylarks first breed when they are one year of age. Nesting may start in late March or early April. The nest is probably built by the female alone and is a shallow depression in the ground lined with grasses. The clutch is 3 to 5 eggs. The eggs of the nominate subspecies average in size and weigh around . They have a grey-white or greenish background and are covered in brown or olive spots. They are incubated only by the female beginning after the last egg is laid and hatch synchronously after 11 days. The altricial young are cared for by both parents and for the first week are fed almost exclusively on insects. The nestlings fledge after 18 to 20 days but they usually leave the nest after 8 to 10 days. They are independent of their parents after around 25 days. The parents can have up to 4 broods in a season.

===Feeding===
The Eurasian skylark walks over the ground searching for food on the soil surface. Its diet consists of insects and plant material such as seeds and young leaves. Unlike a finch (family Fringillidae) it swallows seeds without removing the husk. Insects form an important part of the diet in summer.

===Threats===

In the UK, Eurasian skylark numbers have declined since the 1970s, as determined by the Common Bird Census started in the early 1960s by the British Trust for Ornithology. As of 2017, they were estimated to have declined across the UK by 4-10% over the last 10 years, and by 6-28% over the last 22-25 years. The RSPB have shown that this large decline is mainly due to changes in farming practices and only partly due to pesticides. In the past cereals were planted in the spring, grown through the summer and harvested in the early autumn. Cereals are now planted in the autumn, grown through the winter and are harvested in the early summer. The winter grown fields are much too dense in summer for the Eurasian skylark to be able to walk and run between the wheat stems to find its food.

A list of conservation interventions that could impact the species was published by the RSPB. English farmers are now encouraged and paid to maintain and create biodiversity for improving the habitat for Eurasian skylarks. Natural England&#x27;s Environmental Stewardship Scheme offers 5 and 10-year grants for various beneficial options. For example, there is an option where the farmer can opt to grow a spring cereal instead of a winter one, and leave the stubble untreated with pesticide over the winter. The British Trust for Ornithology likens the stubbles to &quot;giant bird tables&quot; – providing spilt grain and weed seed to foraging birds.

==In culture==

When the word &quot;lark&quot; is used without specification, it usually refers to this species. A collective noun for Eurasian skylarks is an &quot;exaltation&quot;. Although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; describes this usage as &quot;fanciful&quot;, it traces it back to a quotation from John Lydgate dating from about 1430. The verb &quot;skylark&quot;, originally used by sailors, means &quot;play tricks or practical jokes; indulge in horseplay, frolic&quot;. The verb and noun &quot;lark&quot;, with similar meaning, may be related to &quot;skylark&quot; or to the dialect word &quot;laik&quot; (&quot;New Shorter OED&quot;).

The bird is the subject of poems by Percy Bysshe Shelley (&quot;To a Skylark&quot;), George Meredith (&quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;), Ted Hughes (&quot;Skylarks&quot;), and numerous others; and of pieces of music including &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams (inspired by the eponymous poem). It is also the bird emblem of Kumamoto Prefecture. The Skylark of Space is a series of four science fiction novels by E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith.

<text>Alan David Sokal ( ; born January 24, 1955) is an American professor of mathematics at University College London and professor emeritus of physics at New York University. He works with statistical mechanics and combinatorics.

Sokal is a critic of postmodernism, and caused the Sokal affair in 1996 when his deliberately nonsensical paper was published by Duke University Press&#x27;s &quot;Social Text&quot;. He also co-authored a paper criticizing the critical positivity ratio concept in positive psychology.

==Academic career==
Sokal received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College in 1976 and his PhD from Princeton University in 1981. He was advised by the physicist Arthur Wightman. During the summers of 1986, 1987, and 1988, Sokal taught mathematics at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, when the Sandinistas controlled the elected government.

==Research interests==
Sokal&#x27;s research involves mathematical physics and combinatorics. In particular, he studies the interplay between these topics based on questions concerning statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. This includes work on the chromatic polynomial and the Tutte polynomial, which appear both in algebraic graph theory and in the study of phase transitions in statistical mechanics. His interests include computational physics and algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for problems in statistical physics. He also co-authored a book on quantum triviality.

In 2013, Sokal co-authored a paper with Nicholas Brown and Harris Friedman, rejecting the Losada Line, a concept popular in positive psychology. Named after its proposer, Marcial Losada, it refers to a critical range for an individual&#x27;s ratio of positive to negative emotions, outside of which the individual will tend to have poorer life and occupational outcomes. This concept of a critical positivity ratio was much cited and popularised by psychologists such as Barbara Fredrickson. The trio&#x27;s paper, published in &quot;American Psychologist&quot;, contended that the ratio was based on faulty mathematical reasoning and therefore invalid.

== Critiques of postmodernism ==

=== Sokal affair ===
In 1996, Sokal was curious whether the then-non-peer-reviewed postmodern cultural studies journal &quot;Social Text&quot; (published by Duke University Press) would publish a submission which &quot;flattered the editors&#x27; ideological preconceptions&quot;. Sokal submitted a grand-sounding but completely nonsensical paper titled &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.&quot;

After holding the article back from earlier issues because of Sokal&#x27;s refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue as a relevant contribution. Soon thereafter, Sokal then revealed that the article was a hoax in the journal &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;, arguing that leftists and social science would be better served by intellectual underpinnings based on reason. The affair was front-page news in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 18, 1996. Sokal responded to leftist and postmodernist criticism of the deception by asserting that he was himself a leftist, and that his motivation was to &quot;defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself&quot;.

The affair, together with Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Higher Superstition&quot;, can be considered to be a part of the so-called science wars.

Sokal followed up in 1997 by co-authoring the book &quot;Impostures Intellectuelles&quot; with physicist and philosopher of science Jean Bricmont (published in English, a year later, as &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;). The book accuses some social sciences academics of using scientific and mathematical terms incorrectly and criticizes proponents of the &quot;strong program&quot; of the sociology of science for denying the value of truth. The book had contrasted reviews, with some lauding the effort, and some more reserved.

In 2008, Sokal reviewed the Sokal affair and its implications in the book &quot;Beyond the Hoax&quot;.

=== Other critiques ===
In 2024, Sokal co-authored an opinion-editorial article in the newspaper &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; with evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizing the use of the terminology &quot;sex assigned at birth&quot; instead of &quot;sex&quot; by the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sokal and Dawkins argued that sex is an &quot;objective biological reality&quot; that &quot;is determined at conception and is then &quot;observed&quot; at birth,&quot; rather than assigned by a medical professional. Terming this &quot;social constructionism gone amok,&quot; Sokal and Dawkins argued further that &quot;distort[ing] the scientific facts in the service of a social cause&quot; risks undermining trust in medical institutions. Sokal repeated these criticisms in an editorial for the magazine &quot;The Critic&quot; discussing the more general politicization of science, especially biology and medicine.

<doc id="326675" wikidata="Q504507" url="?curid=326675" title="Personal luxury car">
<text>Personal luxury car is a North American car classification describing somewhat sporty, sophisticated mass-market coupés that emphasized comfort over performance. The North American manufacturers most often combined engineering, design, and marketing to develop upscale, distinctive &quot;platform sharing&quot; models that became highly profitable.

Although luxury coupes had been produced in North America for several decades, the beginning of the &quot;personal luxury car&quot; market segment is generally considered to have started in 1958. It was the success of the Ford Thunderbird (second generation) when it was redesigned from a two-seat car to a four-seat vehicle. These changes shifted the Thunderbird&#x27;s emphasis from sporting to comfort and luxury, and sales increased by 50 percent. The Thunderbird was sold for eleven generations up until the 2005 model year.

The longest-running nameplate of the personal luxury car was the 50-year production of the Cadillac Eldorado, which started in the 1953 model year, originally designating ultra-premium, low-volume versions of lower-priced Cadillac models, including the hand-built four-door 1957 Eldorado Brougham. According to &quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot;, Cadillac first entered the &quot;personal luxury car&quot; market in 1967, with a smaller high-volume model.

Before the late 1970s, personal luxury cars were usually large, rear-wheel drive vehicles powered by large V8 engines. As a result of the downsizing trend in the American automotive industry during the late 1970s, many personal luxury cars have been produced as mid-size cars with six-cylinder engines and front-wheel drive. By the 21st century, the personal luxury market had diminished as consumers migrated to other market segments.

==Characteristics==
Personal luxury cars are mass-market vehicles that have a combination of sports car and luxury car characteristics, typically two-door coupés or convertibles, typically with a small rear seat not intended for regular use by adults. Personal luxury car designs emphasize comfort and convenience, often highly equipped with interior features that were either optional or not available on other models.

In contrast to the European grand tourer sporty luxury car, where high-speed performance was key, the American &quot;personal luxury car&quot; typically blunted performance by mating large engines to heavy vehicles. The cars were usually mass-produced and often shared major mechanical components with other models from the manufacturer to reduce production costs. 
==History==
===1950s===
====Niche market====
The initial luxury cars of this category during the 1950s in the United States were expensive, niche market, low-volume vehicles. Described as &quot;quasi-custom&quot; models, marketers at the time promoted them as &quot;sports cars.&quot; This connoted &quot;anything with a convertible top, lots of performance, a few unique styling touches, and top-of-the-line price tag.

These included the Cadillac Eldorado, Buick Roadmaster Skylark, Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta, Imperial Newport, Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Windsor, Packard Hawk, and Packard Caribbean. All models had two-door convertible or hardtop body styles, built on a platform shared with far less expensive models. The Eldorado represented 0.5% of Cadillac&#x27;s total sales in 1953, with 1,690 Buick Skylarks, 458 Oldsmobile 98 Fiestas, and 750 Packard Caribbeans sold. The styling of 1950s luxury cars has been described as a &quot;baroque excess&quot;.

An example is the Continental Mark II introduced for the 1956 model year. With a price of approximately , the cost was equivalent to a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, and 3,012 Mark IIs were sold from 1955 until 1957. It was produced in the two-door hardtop body style with extensive standard equipment for the time that included power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, leather interior, and a tachometer. The only option was air conditioning for $595.

====Mass market====
The Ford Thunderbird, released in 1955, was marketed as a personal car and is often credited with playing a key role in the creation of the personal luxury car segment.

In the early 1950s, both Ford and General Motors were developing competitors to address what they perceived as the growing popularity of the European sports car niche in the North American market. The result was the Ford Thunderbird, Studebaker Speedster, and the Chevrolet Corvette.

The first-generation Thunderbird was a two-seat car with a V8 engine, a suspension designed for comfort instead of handling, and available in either convertible (folding soft-top) or roadster (removable hardtop) body styles. The Thunderbird was able to reach a top speed of , which is similar to many European grand tourers of the era. The Thunderbird&#x27;s &quot;sporty luxury&quot; format, with more features, proved vastly more popular with American car buyers than the spartan Corvette sports car by selling 16,155 units in 1955, compared with 674 Corvettes, 809 Chrysler 300D, and 2,200 Studebaker Speedsters. This market signal set the stage for further development.

The 1958 Ford Thunderbird became the first volume personal luxury car. The redesign added a rear seat in response to Ford&#x27;s market research that the two-seat layout of the first generation was limiting sales. The convertible/roadster body style was replaced by two models, a fixed hardtop and convertible. Sales totaled 198,191 over three model years, approximately four times that of the earlier two-seat model. The Thunderbird received the 1958 Motor Trend Car of the Year award.
===1960s===
Two competitors inspired by the continued marketplace success of the four-seat Thunderbird appeared for model year 1963, both shown at the October 1962 Paris Motor Show. Both followed the close coupled four-seater coupe with powerful engine formula, laid down by the 1958 Thunderbird.

The first was the Studebaker Avanti. The Avanti featured a fiberglass body, an optional supercharged engine, and front disc brakes. It was marketed as &quot;America&#x27;s only four-passenger high-performance personal car&quot;. The company built 4,647 Avantis before Studebaker ended Avanti Production for the 1964 model year.

The second was the 1963 Buick Riviera, which began life as the Cadillac LaSalle XP-715 concept car. However, General Motors management was not interested in the XP-715 concept for Cadillac and offered it up to a competition between interested divisions. Buick won based on its marketing presentation. Total sales for the 1963–1965 model years was 112,244.

American Motors&#x27; first personal luxury car was the intermediate-sized 1965 Rambler Marlin. The Marlin was described as &quot;unusual, distinctive and in a class by itself&quot;. Its design feature is the fastback roofline that terminates at the rear bumper. It was renamed as the AMC Marlin for 1966 to focus it on the personal luxury market.

The Dodge Charger was introduced in 1966 and is similar in size to the AMC Marlin. The cars like the Charger were still classified &quot;specialty cars&quot; as they were not muscle cars but included premium trim and other features.

The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado became the first front-wheel drive personal luxury car. The Toronado provided the platform for the Cadillac Eldorado (eighth generation) to switch to a smaller high volume &#x27;personal luxury&#x27; front-wheel drive layout the following year.

Up until 1967, personal luxury cars were grouped with muscle cars and pony cars as the &quot;specialty cars&quot; classification. Rather than marketing to broad income classes as with their standard models, each of these car classes was targeted by the automakers to smaller and more specific market niches while offering long lists of options to satisfy consumer demands for individuality.

For 1967, the AMC Marlin was increased in size but still considered an intermediate, a &quot;larger 3+3 family coupe designed to appeal to the market&#x27;s trend toward bigger cars with more appointments.&quot; Also for 1967, the Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation) was released, moving further upmarket and with a four-door pillarless hardtop body style being added.

The Continental Mark III two-door coupe was introduced for the 1969 model year as the flagship vehicle of Ford Motor Company and as a successor to the 1956 and 1957 Continental Mark II. The Mark III was based on the chassis of the Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation) to lower development costs. Styling features of the Mark III included hidden headlamps (with retractable body-colored covers), a Rolls-Royce-style grille, and a simulated spare tire on the trunk lid. The Mark III was the first American-made vehicle with radial tires as standard equipment.

In what would become a three-decade rivalry, the 1969 model year Mark III sold 30,858 cars for the extended 1969 model year (although 7,770 were built in 1968), while Eldorado sold 23,333 units that year.

The Mercury Marauder (second generation) was available for 1969 and 1970 as its model line of personal luxury cars in base and X-100 trim. The Marauder utilized Ford&#x27;s redesigned XL hardtop&#x27;s wheelbase that was shorter than other full-sized Mercury models and included a V8 engine. It featured hidden headlamps, a flying buttress-style roofline with available matte-black rear and trunk lid finish, rear fender skirts as well as five-spoke aluminum wheels with white wall bias-ply tires.

Also, for 1969, the Pontiac Grand Prix (third generation) downsized from being a full-size to a mid-size coupe in an attempt to reverse the declining sales of the Grand Prix model. Smaller than the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Toronado, it was designed to be nimbler and more performance-oriented than the Ford Thunderbird and Buick Riviera. Sales reached over 112,000 units, almost quadruple the 32,000 full-sized models built in 1968.

===1970s===
Due to rising insurance costs and emissions standards in the early 1970s, the muscle car&#x27;s decline coincided with a strong upswing in the personal luxury segment as American buyers shifted emphasis from performance to comfort. Offsetting this, the 1973 and 1979 oil crises impacted upon demand for cars with relatively poor fuel economy. The 1970s personal luxury models were marketed based on luxury, not performance. They were conventional in design and shared many parts with lesser models.

Due to the success of the 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix, other GM divisions followed suit and introduced similar cars in 1970. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo— considered an upscale vehicle for GM&#x27;s lowest-priced division— was slightly shorter than the Grand Prix due to being built on the Chevrolet Chevelle platform. The Monte Carlo was marketed as providing &quot;elegance and prestige&quot;, however, some reviewers found it more similar to Chevrolet&#x27;s more utilitarian models. The coupe model of the downsized Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was introduced for 1970 and was sold alongside the larger Oldsmobile Toronado. The base price of the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme were much lower than the Grand Prix. However, all three models were priced similarly if they were ordered with the same level of equipment. Nonetheless, it is claimed that Chevrolet and Pontiac &quot;took personal luxury cars to the masses&quot;. The introduction of the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme did cut into the Grand Prix&#x27;s dominance, and sales dropped 40%.

The 1972 Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation) had a significant increase in size over the previous generation, making it larger than most other personal luxury cars. The 1974 Mercury Cougar XR-7 was upsized to an intermediate platform (shared with the Ford Torino and Mercury Montego), since the Mustang was downsized to become the subcompact Mustang II for 1974, leaving the Cougar XR-7 without a platform-mate. The Cougar XR-7 was marketed from 1974 through 1976 alongside the Ford Elite, styled to resemble the Thunderbird, and marketed at a lower price. The Cougar XR-7 was priced higher than the Elite and included more standard features, but sold about 60,000 units compared to almost 125,000 Elites during the 1975 model year.

Foreign manufacturers took advantage of this American consumer trend. Notably Mercedes-Benz introduced the 450SL and SLC models. Total production was 237,287 (SL) and 62,888 (SLC), and North America was the key market for these models, with 2/3 of production officially sold there - before additional cars from the grey market. Mercedes-Benz were coy in their American ad copy about the car being a sports car, advising potential buyers &quot;Spoil Yourself&quot; and asking &quot;How can a 2-seater weighing 3,500 pounds loaded down with an automatic transmission and luxury power amenities be considered a sports car?.&quot; The 450SL addressed the same market niche as the 1955-57 two-seat Ford Thunderbird &quot;personal car&quot;, which had similar categorization issues.

The mid-size Chrysler Cordoba was introduced in 1975 as the company&#x27;s first coupe produced specifically for the personal luxury market (despite the company declaring earlier that there would &quot;never be a smaller Chrysler&quot;). The Cordoba used vintage styling cues like Rolls-Royce-style radiator grilles, opera windows, and vinyl roofs. By 1975, other models that had entered the personal luxury car segment included the AMC Matador (second generation), Buick Regal, Dodge Charger (fourth generation). The two highest-selling personal luxury cars for 1975 were the Chevrolet Monte Carlo and the Chrysler Cordoba.

During the mid-1970s, luxury features become more common in compact and subcompact cars. The 1978 Plymouth Sapporo coupe (a rebadged Mitsubishi Galant Lambda built in Japan) was marketed as a personal luxury car, featuring a vinyl roof with stainless steel targa band, velour interior, &quot;luxury&quot; wheel covers with whitewall tires, and various power accessories.

For the 1977 model year, the Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation) was downsized to an intermediate-size platform (based on the Ford LTD II), shedding nearly of length and of weight. It was repositioned as the replacement for the Ford Elite and sold alongside the closely related Mercury Cougar (fourth generation). The Thunderbird was assembled using a mix of body, interior, and trim parts from the previous year&#x27;s Ford Elite, Mercury Montego, and Mercury Cougar, plus unique styling for the rear bodywork. This generation became the best-selling in the history of the Ford Thunderbird. Helped by a $2,700 price reduction from 1976, over 318,000 sold in 1977 and 352,000 in 1978 (the best single sales year in Thunderbird history), followed by 295,000 in 1979.

The 1978 Buick Regal, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the Pontiac Grand Prix were among the first of the personal luxury cars to be radically downsized, resulting in weight reductions of more than and exterior dimensions similar to compact cars (e.g. the Chevrolet Nova, Ford Granada and Dodge Dart).

For 1979, Cadillac Eldorado (tenth generation), Buick Riviera (sixth generation) and Oldsmobile Toronado (third generation) were downsized to an intermediate-sized front-wheel-drive platform, resulting in a reduction in length in the case of the Eldorado. Engines were also downsized, with V6 engines available in the Riviera and Toronado models for the first time. The Riviera was named the 1979 Motor Trend &quot;Car of the Year&quot;. Sales more than doubled to 52,181 for 1979 and reached 48,621 units for the similar 1980 models.
===1980s===
Throughout the 1970s, American-built personal luxury cars had grown larger and more luxurious, resulting in heavier cars. However, engine power output decreased because of using six-cylinder engines or detuning the V8 engines to comply with increasingly strict vehicle emissions standards. Along with the reduced straight-line performance, the cars also had poor fuel economy. They also needed to meet the rising corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) regulations set by the United States Secretary of Transportation via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The 1981 Imperial (sixth generation) by Chrysler Corporation marked a key milestone in the decline of the personal luxury car. The V8 engine produced only , Reaction in the motoring press was especially vicious, with &quot;Car and Driver&quot; referring to this Imperial as an outmoded &quot;all frosting&quot; automobile. Sales were poor. The Imperial was built on the Chrysler Cordoba (second generation) chassis, a car with declining sales, that was discontinued in 1983.

The 1980 model year Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation) and Mercury Cougar (fifth generation) were downsized to a mid-size car and described by some as &quot;stodgy-looking&quot;. Sales were drastically reduced, resulting in extensive revisions for the 1983 model year. While remaining a personal luxury coupe, the redesign of the Thunderbird and Cougar introduced highly aerodynamic body design to Ford vehicles in North America and significantly increased sales.

In 1981, sales of the Continental Mark VI were down 50%.

For the 1984 model year, Continental Mark VII was downsized to a mid-size car, with aerodynamic styling based on the Ford Fox platform shared with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.

For 1986, General Motors drastically downsized the Cadillac Eldorado (eleventh generation), Buick Riviera (seventh generation) and Oldsmobile Toronado (fourth generation) by . With an Eldorado Coupe unit sales drop of 72% in 1986, seldom has any model experienced such a dramatic fall in annual sales. The base price of the 1986 Eldorado increased by approximately 16% to $24,251, and production was reduced to about a quarter of what it had been just two years earlier. The Riviera and Toronado used Buick&#x27;s V6 engine, while Cadillac continued to use their V8 engine. Similarly, the 1986 Riviera&#x27;s base price increased substantially to $19,831, and sales plummeted to 22,138 for 1986, only 15,223 for 1987, and 8,625 for 1988 (although the 1988 introduction of the Buick Reatta coupe may have cannibalized some Riviera sales that year).

The final year of production for the rear-wheel-drive Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (fourth generation) was 1988, during which 27,678 were built.

For the 1988 model year, GM moved the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Pontiac Grand Prix to versions based on its front-wheel-drive W-body platform. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was discontinued after a short 1988 model year run (replaced by the 1990 Chevrolet Lumina mid-size coupe). With the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Celebrity and Pontiac 6000, the Regal, Cutlass Supreme, and Grand Prix moved from the personal luxury segment to the conventional mid-size segment and were also offered in the four-door sedan body style.
===1990s===
In the early 1990s, the trend towards four-door sedans and SUVs caused the market for personal luxury cars to decline even more. The Oldsmobile Toronado was discontinued in 1992. The Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar were discontinued after the 1997 model year (although the Cougar nameplate was revived for 1999 as a mid-size sport compact).

The Lincoln Mark VIII, introduced for 1993, was discontinued in 1998, thereby ending the Mark series. The total production of Mark VIII was slightly more than 126,000 units. General Motors ended production of the Buick Riviera in 1998, with 1,956 cars produced in the final model year.

For the 1995 model year, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo was re-introduced and built on the front-wheel drive GM W-body platform. It was the two-door coupe version of the updated Lumina four-door sedan replacing the previous year&#x27;s Lumina two-door coupe.

===2000s===
In 2001, General Motors announced that the Eldorado&#x27;s 50th model year (2002) would be its last. To mark the end of the nameplate, a limited production run of 1,596 cars was produced in red or white—the colors available on the original 1953 convertible. Production ended on April 22, 2002. The Lansing Craft Centre was retooled to build the Chevrolet SSR.

The Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation) was introduced for the 2002 model year. It retained the traditional rear-wheel drive layout and was based on the Ford DEW platform. With styling cues from the original 1955 through 1957 Thunderbirds, it was part of an early-2000s retro styling trend that included the Volkswagen New Beetle, Chrysler PT Cruiser, Plymouth/Chrysler Prowler and Mini Hatch. It was initially well received by the automotive press, garnering accolades such as the Motor Trend Car of the Year and a nomination for the North American Car of the Year in its first year. However, many publications did not regard the Thunderbird&#x27;s revival that highly. It garnered a place on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2009 list of &quot;The 10 Most Embarrassing Award Winners in Automotive History&quot;. Sales did not meet Ford&#x27;s expectations and the Thunderbird was discontinued in 2005.

The 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (sixth generation) was also influenced by the retro trend, incorporating styling cues from its 1970s and 1980s predecessors. The Monte Carlo was the final, american personal luxury car in production when it was discontinued at the end of the 2007 model year.

<doc id="326686" wikidata="Q19220" url="?curid=326686" title="Henry Tang">
<text>Henry Tang Ying-yen (; born 6 September 1952) is a Hong Kong politician who served as the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong between 2007 and 2011. He held the position of Financial Secretary from 2003 to 2007. In 2012, he lost the Hong Kong Chief Executive Election to Leung Chun-ying.

==Background and education==
Tang was born 6 September 1952 at early morning at Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital in Happy Valley, Wan Chai in British Hong Kong, His family operated in the textile industry and came from Wuxi, Jiangsu to Hong Kong in 1949 to escape the communists who were taking over the Chinese mainland. Henry Tang himself was born in what was then British Hong Kong in 1952. Tang went to Culford School in Suffolk in Britain before attending and graduating from Cranbrook Schools in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1975.

Henry Tang is commonly believed to have attended Graduate School at Yale University and to have obtained a master&#x27;s degree in sociology. These were credentials submitted to then Hong Kong governor David Wilson in 1991–1992. So far there is no evidence that he did obtain that degree.

Tang has extensive ties with the central government of China as his father Tang Hsiang Chien was a standing committee member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, the advisory body to the National People&#x27;s Congress.

==Career==
Tang was named Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in 1993 and won the Young Industrialist of Hong Kong award in 1989.

Between 1995 and 2001 he served as the Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. He was also a Committee Member of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and a Steward of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. He was Chairman of the Provisional Construction Industry Co-ordination Board (PCICB) before joining the government.

Tang was a member of the Executive Council from the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 to 2011. He served as a member of the Legislative Council for seven years from 1991 to 1998 as a member of the Liberal Party, a pro-business and pro-Beijing party, prior to joining the government.

Tang has also served extensively on various government boards and public bodies, including the Trade Development Council, Town Planning Board, University Grants Committee, and Council of the City University of Hong Kong.

Tang took up his commerce post in July 2002 as part of a line-up of new secretaries aimed at improving the government&#x27;s transparency. He was promoted from Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology to Financial Secretary on 4 August 2003 replacing Antony Leung. Leung resigned on 16 July 2003 due to allegations of tax evasion in regards to his new car. Tang briefly served (25 May to 21 June 2005) as acting chief executive after Tung Chee Hwa, the former chief executive who resigned citing health reasons.

On 25 May 2005, Donald Tsang, the Chief Secretary for Administration, resigned to stand in the &#x27;by-election&#x27; for Chief Executive. Tang served as Acting Chief Executive of HKSAR soon after Tsang&#x27;s resignation was announced.

===Harbourfest case===
Tang was involved in the Harbour Fest controversy as Chairman of the Economic Relaunch Strategy Group responsible for pushing ahead with the plan to spend $100 million to revive the economy after SARS, and said that he should be held responsible. Tang had said that although Mike Rowse, a senior civil servant, had actually signed the contract, Rowse as such was not required to be held politically responsible. However, during a Working Group meeting on 31 October 2003 and during an independent inquiry in May 2004, Tang allegedly said Rowse had not acted improperly and that there had been no irregularity in the implementation of the event. Tang had also said that all parties had underestimated the complexity of the event and may have been too ambitious in organising it in such a short timespan. He later withdrew the remark: just before a government inquiry opened in November 2004, Tang requested the ERWG minutes be deleted. Internal governmental disciplinary process fined Rowse for misconduct, but a High Court judge quashed the government ruling on 4 July 2008. Political commentator Frank Ching pointed to the huge credibility gap of the government. He noted that Tang&#x27;s attempt to shift political responsibility from himself, as the minister responsible, to a senior civil servant, was a travesty of justice for Rowse, and went against the Accountability System.

===Chief Secretary for Administration===

On 23 June 2007, it was announced that Tang would succeed Rafael Hui as the new Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong effective 1 July 2007.

====2010 shoeing incident====

On 6 March 2010, Tang attended a Youth Summit in Chai Wan organised by the Home Affairs Bureau. A 31-year-old jobless man threw a shoe at Tang and it landed on the stage metres away from him. The man was dragged away by police. The man said he was unemployed after getting fired by a computer company, and the government policies were not helping him. He said he was not a &quot;post-80s&quot; teen, but supported the highspeed rail protest connecting HK to Guangdong. A protester said that the topics discussed in the summit are not those that any young person would be interested in.

====2011 car crash comment and protest====
On 15 January 2011, Tang gave a speech at the Roundtable Institute that included controversial comments about the Hong Kong post-80s generation. He said the young generations need to take responsibilities, and he cautioned them for slamming others because of opposing views. Then he stressed the need to compromise and simplify complicated issues. He further said young people should not close the door and act like emperors. That he doesn&#x27;t want to see politics lead to a bloodshed, leading to a road of no return and end up like a fatal car crash.

On 21 January 2011, Leung Kwok-hung led a group of protesters to a public forum with a toy model car. He then smashed the car in front of Henry Tang to represent a fatal car crash. On 30 January 2011 eight youth groups including Hong Kong Federation of Students marched to New World Development, Li Ka Shing&#x27;s Cheung Kong Holdings in Central and accused the government of colluding with businesses in maximising profits while squeezing the poor. The students criticised Tang and the government for policies that benefit the upper class only like no real estate tax duty, reduction of wine and profit tax. The students said the whole HK is at the mercy of real estate developers.

===Unauthorized building works===

From 13 February 2012, Hong Kong media reported unauthorised building works of Tang&#x27;s two adjoined residences at York Road, Kowloon Tong. On 16 February 2012, an inspection by officials of the Buildings Department revealed a basement with an area of more than 2200 square feet (11 m by 19 m) that was not documented in the approved floor plan. Tang admitted at a press conference that he was aware of the construction of an illegal basement at his family house and said that it was his wife&#x27;s idea. His wife agreed that the responsibility was hers The admission followed several denials and provoked widespread criticism: &quot;He has lost almost all his credibility, he lied every day,&quot; said Ma Ngok, a political sciences professor at the University of Hong Kong to AFP.

The scandal prompted some of Tang&#x27;s potential supporters in the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election to review their position. One former supporter said that it was &#x27;unbearable&#x27; for Tang to throw the blame onto his wife.

No charges were brought against Tang though his wife was convicted of a criminal offence and fined HK$110,000, the illegal basement having been filled in.

===2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election===

On 28 September 2011, in a widely trailed move, Tang resigned from his post, and then in late November announced his candidacy for chief executive. He was widely believed to be preferred by Beijing, and hence quickly received support from many financial heavyweights, including Former Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, HSBC Asia-Pacific chief executive Peter Wong Tung-shun, and &#x27;Father of Lan Kwai Fong&#x27;, Allan Zeman. However, in an unprecedented turn of events, including a series of scandals and dramatically reduced levels of public support, the final vote by the Election Committee saw him lose to Leung Chun-ying.

===Possible replacement as Chief Executive===

The Financial Times reported, on 23 October 2019, that Tang was being considered as a replacement for Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong. However, the Chinese government denied such deliberations.

=== West Kowloon Cultural District Authority ===
Tang serves as the chairperson of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, which oversees the M+ museum of contemporary art. In March 2021, Tang said that the Authority would &quot;definitely uphold the law and comply with the Basic Law, local laws and the national security law&quot; in regards to art made by Ai Weiwei.

==Family and personal life==
Tang is married to Lisa Kuo Yu-chin and the couple have four children: three daughters and a son.

Tang&#x27;s father Tang Hsiang Chien was a standing committee member of the CPPCC.

His brother, Tom Tang Chung-yen, is a member of the Trade Development Council, whose reappointment to the post by CY Leung, after he vanquished Tang to become chief executive in 2012, was seen as part of a reconciliation between the two camps. Apple Daily found in October 2020 that Tom Tang may have illegally violated land lease terms of an industrial site in Tai Po.

His niece (by marriage), Stefani Kuo, a playwright and actress, spoke out against the Hong Kong government during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, views that Tang explicitly rejected.

In February 2021, Tang said that he has a high tendency for allergic reactions to influenza vaccinations, and thus would not take a mainland Chinese COVID-19 vaccine.

===Extra-marital affairs===
On 4 October 2011, in the midst of rumours about his extra-marital affair with Shirley Yuen, his administrative assistant when he was finance secretary of Hong Kong, Henry Tang issued a statement, in which he admitted that he had made a mistake in his romantic life in the past and he deeply regretted it. He said that his wife had forgiven him. His wife said in the statement that there had been difficult times in their relationship and that he has faults, but that she also appreciated his strengths. She acknowledged him as her &#x27;best partner&#x27;. National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee member Rita Fan said on 7 October 2011 that she didn&#x27;t know about Tang&#x27;s now widely publicised infidelity when she offered her support and she refused to rule herself out of standing in the following year&#x27;s chief executive election, though she did not in fact stand.

In February 2012, several Chinese newspapers reported Henry Tang might have had a relationship with Esther Lam, the daughter of Heung Yee Kuk vice-chairman Daniel Lam Wai-keung. Emails supposedly exchanged by the two of them and a picture showing them shoulder against shoulder have been published. Tang denied the reports claiming &quot;we are only casual acquaintances&quot;.

<doc id="326691" wikidata="Q311450" url="?curid=326691" title="Billy Preston">
<text>William Everett Preston (September 2, 1946 – June 6, 2006) was an American keyboardist, singer, and songwriter whose work encompassed R&amp;B, rock, soul, funk, and gospel. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, backing Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, the Everly Brothers, Reverend James Cleveland, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. He gained attention as a solo artist with hit singles &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;, the Grammy-winning &quot;Outa-Space&quot;, &quot;Will It Go Round in Circles&quot;, &quot;Space Race&quot;, &quot;Nothing from Nothing&quot;, and &quot;With You I&#x27;m Born Again&quot;. Additionally, Preston co-wrote &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;, which became a No. 5 hit for Joe Cocker.

Preston is one of very few musicians to be given a credit on a Beatles recording, which was done at the band&#x27;s request; the group&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;Get Back&quot; was credited as &quot;The Beatles with Billy Preston&quot;. He continued to record and perform with George Harrison after the Beatles&#x27; breakup, along with other artists such as Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones on many of the group&#x27;s albums and tours during the 1970s. Preston was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence Award category in 2021.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Preston was born September 2, 1946, in Houston but moved to Los Angeles as a child with his mother Robbie Lee Williams. A child prodigy, Preston was self taught, never having had a music lesson. By the age of ten, he was playing organ onstage backing gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson. At 11, Preston appeared on Nat King Cole&#x27;s NBC TV show singing the Fats Domino hit &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; with Cole. He appeared in &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, the 1958 W. C. Handy biopic starring Cole; Preston played Handy at a younger age. In 1960, he became a pianist for Andraé Crouch with the Church of God in Christ Singers, which first recorded the smash gospel hit &quot;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power&quot;.

In 1962, Preston joined Little Richard&#x27;s band as organist, and while performing in Hamburg he met the Beatles. In 1963, he played the organ on Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Night Beat&quot; album and released his debut album, &quot;16 Yr. Old Soul&quot;, for Cooke&#x27;s SAR label. In 1965, he released the album &quot;The Most Exciting Organ Ever&quot; and performed on the rock and roll show &quot;Shindig!&quot; In May or June 1965, he had a session with Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix in New York City, yielding the soul classic &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;ve Got&quot;. In 1967, he joined Ray Charles&#x27; band. Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.

===The Beatles===
Preston is among those sometimes known as the &quot;Fifth Beatle&quot;. After befriending the group in 1962, Preston joined the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions in January 1969. At one point John Lennon proposed the idea of having Preston join the band; Paul McCartney countered it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four. Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film &quot;Let It Be&quot; and on its companion album. Footage of their collaboration appeared in the 2021 documentary &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; directed by Peter Jackson. Preston accompanied the band on electric piano for its rooftop concert, the group&#x27;s final public appearance. In April 1969, their single &quot;Get Back&quot; was credited to &quot;The Beatles with Billy Preston&quot;, the only time an artist was credited as a co-performer with the Beatles after the band started recording as independent artists. The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston&#x27;s presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the 1969 &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album, contributing organ to the tracks &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;.

In 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in Robert Stigwood&#x27;s film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which was based on the Beatles&#x27; album of the same name, and sang and danced to &quot;Get Back&quot; as the penultimate song.

===Post-Beatles solo career===

Signed to the Beatles&#x27; Apple label, in 1969, Preston released the album &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;, produced by George Harrison, the title song from which was a hit single in Britain. His association with Harrison continued after the Beatles&#x27; breakup in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison&#x27;s subsequent international hit &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, on his 1970 album &quot;Encouraging Words&quot;, which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison&#x27;s 1970s solo albums, starting with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;; made a notable contribution to the Concert for Bangladesh, the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of North America; and played at the 2002 Concert for George tribute, held at Royal Albert Hall. Preston worked on solo releases by Lennon and Ringo Starr.

In 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with Herb Alpert&#x27;s A&amp;M Records. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when Stephen Stills asked to use Preston&#x27;s phrase &quot;if you can&#x27;t be with the one you love, Love the One You&#x27;re With&quot;, a song on Stills&#x27;s self-titled debut solo album.

Following the release of &quot;I Wrote a Simple Song&quot; on A&amp;M, Preston&#x27;s solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972&#x27;s &quot;Outa-Space&quot;, an instrumental track that further popularized the sound of the clavinet in funk music. The song reached number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B chart, before going on to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. &quot;Outa-Space&quot; sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in June 1972. Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit blaxploitation film &quot;Slaughter&quot; starring Jim Brown.

Over the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles &quot;Will It Go Round in Circles&quot; (which displaced Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot; at the top on July 7, 1973) and &quot;Nothing from Nothing&quot;, and the number 4 hit &quot;Space Race&quot;. Each of the three singles sold in excess of one million copies. &quot;American Bandstand&quot; host and executive producer Dick Clark enjoyed &quot;Space Race&quot; so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.
From 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet, and various synthesizers) for the Rolling Stones, sometimes alongside pianists Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart, on their albums &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; and &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. As the band&#x27;s primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he performed as a support act with his own band (including Mick Taylor on guitar) on their 1973 European tour. A Munich performance from this tour was documented on Preston&#x27;s album &quot;Live European Tour 1973&quot;. In 1974, along with Bruce Fisher, one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;. On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s series premiere episode. Preston&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; was the basis for the Rolling Stones&#x27; track &quot;Melody&quot;, released on &quot;Black and Blue&quot; in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band&#x27;s 1975 and 1976 (plus the El Mocambo) live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like Mick Jagger&#x27;s &quot;Wandering Spirit&quot;, and made appearances on the band&#x27;s &quot;Tattoo You&quot; and &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;.

After seven years with A&amp;M, he signed with Motown. In 1979, he duetted with Syreeta Wright on the ballad &quot;With You I&#x27;m Born Again&quot;, which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Preston&#x27;s career lost momentum in the 1980s, during which he became addicted to cocaine and alcohol. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as Luther Vandross (his organ solos were included on Vandross&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;Til My Baby Comes Home&quot;), Whitney Houston and Patti LaBelle, among others. He served as musical director for &quot;Nightlife&quot;, a late-night talk show hosted by David Brenner that lasted one season from 1986 to 1987.

Preston toured with Eric Clapton, recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists. He toured with Ringo Starr, appearing on his 1990 live album. He was invited to become a member of The Band in 1991, after the death of piano player Stan Szelest. He performed on tour with the group, but the sentencing from his cocaine and sexual assault charges in 1991 ended the collaboration.

===Later work===

In 1997, Preston recorded the album &quot;You and I&quot;, in Italy, with Italian band Novecento. The album was produced by Vaughn De Spenza and Novecento members Lino and Pino Nicolosi. In 1998, Preston played organ during the choir numbers on the UPN comedy show &quot;Good News&quot;. The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, as part of the Louisiana Gator Boys supergroup.

On November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, after a long illness. Preston, among many of Harrison&#x27;s longtime friends, performed in the 2002 Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Preston&#x27;s performance of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;, provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the Hammond organ for the show.

In 2002, Preston appeared on the Johnny Cash album &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot;, playing piano on &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Tear-Stained Letter&quot;.

In 2004, Preston toured with the Funk Brothers and Steve Winwood in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America. After the Clapton tours, he went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the &quot;Legends Rock&quot; TV show. His performance included a duet with Sam Moore on &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;; this was Preston&#x27;s last filmed concert.

In 2004, Preston performed as a jazz organist on Ray Charles&#x27;s &quot;Genius Loves Company&quot;, an album of duets, on the song &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; with Charles and Norah Jones.

In March 2005, he appeared on the &quot;American Idol&quot; fourth-season finale. Playing piano, he performed &quot;With You I&#x27;m Born Again&quot; with Vonzell Solomon (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded &quot;Go Where No One&#x27;s Gone Before&quot;, the main title song for the anime series &quot;L/R: Licensed by Royalty&quot;.

Preston played clavinet on the song &quot;Warlocks&quot; for the Red Hot Chili Peppers album &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed. Preston&#x27;s final recorded contributions were the gospel-tinged organ on the Neil Diamond album &quot;12 Songs&quot; (2005), and his keyboard work on &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot; (2006) by Eric Clapton and J. J. Cale.

In late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972 documentary film &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;. He played a set of three Harrison songs—&quot;Give Me Love&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;—with Dhani Harrison and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.

==Personal life==

===Religion===
Preston was brought up in the African-American gospel tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;. His personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock &amp; roll in which he often worked, but he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like John Lennon&#x27;s openly atheistic song &quot;God&quot;. Preston was deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;.

===Sexuality===
Although the details did not become fully known to the general public until after his death, Preston struggled throughout his life to cope with his homosexuality, and deal with the lasting effects of the traumatic sexual abuse he suffered as a boy. Although his sexual orientation became known to friends and associates in the music world (such as Keith Richards), Preston did not publicly come out as gay until just before he died, partly because he felt that it conflicted with his deeply held religious beliefs and his lifelong association with the church. In his autobiography, &quot;Life&quot; (2010), Keith Richards mentioned Preston&#x27;s struggles with his homosexuality.

In an interview for a 2010 BBC Radio 4 documentary on his life and career, Preston&#x27;s manager Joyce Moore revealed that after she began handling his affairs, Preston opened up to her about the lifelong trauma he had suffered as the result of being sexually abused as a child. Preston told Moore that at about the age of nine, after he and his mother moved to Los Angeles from Houston to perform in a touring production of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, he was repeatedly abused by the touring company&#x27;s pianist. When Preston told his mother about the abuse, she did not believe him, and failed to protect him. The abuse went on for the entire summer, and Preston was also later abused by a local pastor.

Another traumatic incident, which reportedly affected Preston deeply, occurred in the early 1970s, while he was engaged to actress and model Kathy Silva. At this time Preston had become close friends with musician Sly Stone, and made many contributions to Stone&#x27;s recordings of the period (including the album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;). According to Moore, Preston was devastated when he came home one day to find Stone in bed with Silva (who later married Stone on stage at Madison Square Garden). According to Moore, Silva&#x27;s affair with Stone was the trigger that led Preston to stop having relationships with women. It was after this incident that he began using cocaine and having sex with men, and Moore has stated that she saw his drug abuse as his way of coping with the internal conflicts he felt about his &quot;sexual urges&quot;.

===Legal issues and drug addiction===
In 1991, Preston checked into a drug rehabilitation program to treat his addictions.

While on probation for a drunk driving conviction in August 1991, Preston was arrested for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old Mexican boy, after picking him up at a gathering point for day laborers. The boy told authorities that Preston took him to his Malibu home, smoked cocaine, showed him pornographic pictures and tried to assault him before he escaped. Preston was also charged with assault with a deadly weapon involving a man he picked up to do work at his home, the day before his arrest in the case involving the boy. After submitting to a drug test, Preston tested positive for cocaine. He entered no-contest pleas to the cocaine and assault charges. The sex charges which included misdemeanor charges of child molestation and exhibiting pornographic material to a minor were dismissed. He was sentenced to nine months at a drug rehabilitation center and three months of house arrest.

In 1992, Preston was sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating his probation on a drunk driving conviction.

In 1997, Preston was sentenced to three years in a California prison for cocaine possession in violation of his probation. He had been placed on three years&#x27; probation earlier that year after testing positive for cocaine use; under the terms, he agreed to spend 90 days in jail and to remain drug-free.

While in prison in 1998, Preston was indicted for a $1 million insurance fraud scheme after setting fire to his own house in Los Angeles. He pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against other defendants involved in the scam. His plea called for five years of probation, one year in jail, and $60,000 in restitution. The probation and jail time ran concurrent with his cocaine possession conviction. At California&#x27;s Avenal State Prison, Preston led a chorus and performed at church services. He served 18 months of his four-year sentence, after which he apparently became drug-free.

==Death==
Preston had suffered kidney disease in his later years, brought on by his hypertension. He received a kidney transplant in 2002, but his health continued to deteriorate. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in Malibu, California, and suffered pericarditis there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma from November 21, 2005. Preston died on June 6, 2006, in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Preston&#x27;s funeral was held June 21, 2006. At the funeral, which lasted almost three hours, Joe Cocker sang, Little Richard spoke, and a brass band played a version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Other musical performers included the Temptations&#x27; lead vocalist Ali Woodson and singer Merry Clayton. A gospel choir sang throughout. The mourners also heard letters written by Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and others who had toured and recorded with Preston. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Legacy==
Miles Davis&#x27; 1974 album &quot;Get Up with It&quot; features a track called &quot;Billy Preston&quot; in his honor.

Ringo Starr, speaking during the rehearsals for the &quot;Concert for George&quot; in 2002, called Preston one of the greatest Hammond organ players of all time. In another interview Starr said, &quot;Billy never put his hands in the wrong place. Never.&quot;

In his introduction to the 2010 BBC Radio program &quot;Billy Preston: That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;, former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman said of Preston: &quot;Every keyboard player I know loves Billy Preston. You can spot his playing a mile off, whether it&#x27;s the Hammond organ, the Fender Rhodes or the piano. He had such a &quot;spiritual&quot; touch to his technique; it made him completely unique.&quot;

In 2021, White Horse Pictures and Homegrown Pictures announced that they were making a documentary on Preston, to be directed by Paris Barclay.

Jon Batiste plays Preston in the 2024 film &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

In 2024, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked Preston as the fourth greatest keyboard player of all time, calling him &quot;the ultimate RnB keyboard player&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
Preston was nominated for nine Grammy Awards and won two. He won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for &quot;Outa-Space&quot; at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards in 1973. He also won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his participation in the album &quot;The Concert For Bangla Desh&quot; at the same ceremony.
He was inducted into the Class of 2021 of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Musical Excellence Award.

<doc id="326692" wikidata="Q2368509" url="?curid=326692" title="Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll">
<text>Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll (1532/1537 – 12 September 1573) was a Scottish nobleman, peer, and politician. He was one of the leading figures in the politics of Scotland during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the early part of that of James VI.

==Rise to prominence==
Succeeding his father Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll (c. 1507–1558) in the earldom in 1558, Argyll&#x27;s inheritance made him one of the most powerful magnates in the kingdom. A devout Protestant, he along with his brother-in-law, Lord James Stewart, illegitimate son of James V of Scotland, became an adherent of John Knox about 1556. Like his father he was one of the most influential members of the party of religious reform, signing what was probably the first &quot;godly band&quot; in December 1557, and Argyll soon became one of the leaders of the Lords of the Congregation. Together, Argyll and Stewart negotiated with Sir William Cecil to secure English aid against the regent, Mary of Guise, by the Treaty of Berwick, and were largely responsible for the negotiation of the Treaty of Edinburgh in 1560, which saw the triumph of the Congregation and the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland. It was about this time that Cecil referred to Argyll as &quot;a goodly gentleman universally honoured of all Scotland.&quot;

==Influences of national events==
=== Mary&#x27;s court ===
With the young queen&#x27;s return to Scotland in 1561, Argyll and Stewart, now Earl of Moray, retained their leading roles in the kingdom, continuing to pursue an anglophilic policy, and Argyll was separated from the party of Knox. Mary, Queen of Scots, and Moray came to Castle Campbell in January 1563 to celebrate the marriage of his sister, Margaret Campbell, to James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune. Her courtiers put on a masque, dressed as shepherds.

Mary and her court wore Highland clothes for a visit to Argyll and Inveraray in 1563. Mary wore a &quot;marvellous fair&quot; costume which had been a gift from Agnes Campbell the wife of James MacConel or MacDonald of Dunyvaig.

=== Chaseabout raid ===
The Earl of Argyll was said to be an opponent of the planned wedding of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Henry, Lord Darnley. It was said that Argyll was a leader of a plot to kidnap Mary and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in June 1565 as they travelled between Perth and Edinburgh. They would be imprisoned in Lochleven Castle or Castle Campbell. According to Adam Blackwood the plot failed while the other conspirators were waiting for Argyll, when the Laird of Dowhill gave Mary a warning. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph said that Argyll came towards Kinross hoping to meet Mary, but only to join her for a discussion over dinner.

The Argyll&#x27;s pre-eminence at court came to an end in 1565, with the queen&#x27;s marriage to Darnley, whose claims to the English throne did not endear him to Elizabeth I of England, leading Argyll, the Earl of Moray, and other Protestant leaders to rise in a revolt, now known as the &quot;Chaseabout Raid&quot;. When the English failed to help their Scottish allies, Argyll, alone of the rebels, was able to remain in the Kingdom, due to his very strong position in the Highlands. The failure of the English to come to the aid of his party led to the beginning of Argyll&#x27;s disillusionment with his previous Anglophilic policy.

=== Mary at Lochleven ===
Argyll can be connected to the assassinations of David Rizzio in 1566 and of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in 1567. Although supposed to be a signatory of the Ainslie Tavern Bond, Argyll was horrified by the Queen&#x27;s marriage to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. He joined with Moray and other Protestant leaders in fighting Mary and Bothwell in that year, leading to the capture of the queen at Carberry Hill, but broke with his former allies over the question of deposing the queen.

===Offices held and military involvement===
With Mary&#x27;s escape from prison in 1568, Argyll became the leader of the Queen&#x27;s Party, and led Mary&#x27;s army in the defeat at Langside in which he showed little military skill. He continued to champion the queen&#x27;s cause following her flight to England, but eventually reconciled with the regent Lennox in 1571, and lent his support to the King&#x27;s party, as a means of restoring peace and lessening English meddling in Scottish affairs. He was appointed to the Privy Council that year, and became Lord Chancellor of Scotland in 1572.

==Role in Ulster politics==
Argyll, in his role as Campbell clan chief, was also heavily involved in the politics of Ulster during the 1560s. Although he initially hoped for an alliance with the English to secure his claims on land possessed by the O&#x27;Donnell and Sorley Boy MacDonnell families against the encroachment of the O&#x27;Neill, English unwillingness to work with him led him to ally with Shane O&#x27;Neill, and orchestrate a marriage alliance among the three feuding clans of Ulster, which would ultimately have major effects on Irish history with the eruption of the Hugh O&#x27;Neill rebellion in the 1590s.

In February 1569, an English official, Nicholas White, visited Mary, Queen of Scots, at Tutbury Castle. They mentioned that he was going to Ireland, and White said that the chiefest troubles of Ireland proceed from the north of Scotland, through the Earl of Argyll&#x27;s &quot;supportation&quot;. Mary did not give him much of an answer.

==Marriages and death==
He first married Lady Jean Stewart (died 1588), daughter of James V of Scotland and Elizabeth Bethune; he was thus half-brother-in-law to Mary and to Moray. After divorcing Jean Stewart, Argyll married Jean Cunningham, daughter of the Earl of Glencairn in August 1573. Janet Cunningham gave birth to the Earl&#x27;s stillborn posthumous son in June 1574. She subsequently married Humphrey Colquhoun of Luss and died in 1585.

Argyll died in September 1573, without male issue, and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church. He was succeeded by his half-brother Colin.

<text>The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer. Bauxite, the most important ore of aluminium, contains only 30–60% aluminium oxide (Al2O3), the rest being a mixture of silica, various iron oxides, and titanium dioxide. The aluminium oxide must be further purified before it can be refined into aluminium.

The Bayer process is also the main source of gallium as a byproduct despite low extraction yields.

== Process == 

Bauxite ore is a mixture of hydrated aluminium oxides and compounds of other elements such as iron. The aluminium compounds in the bauxite may be present as gibbsite (Al(OH)3), böhmite (γ-AlO(OH)) or diaspore (α-AlO(OH)); the different forms of the aluminium component and the impurities dictate the extraction conditions. Aluminium oxides and hydroxides are amphoteric, meaning that they are both acidic and basic. The solubility of Al(III) in water is very low but increases substantially at either high or low pH. In the Bayer process, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at a temperature of . At these temperatures, the aluminium is dissolved as sodium aluminate (primarily [Al(OH)4]−) in an extraction process. After separation of the residue by filtering, gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide crystals from previous extractions. The precipitation may take several days without addition of seed crystals.

The extraction process (&quot;digestion&quot;) converts the aluminium oxide in the ore to soluble sodium aluminate, NaAlO2, according to the chemical equation:

:Al(OH)3+ NaOH → NaAlO2 + 2 H2O

This treatment also dissolves silica, forming sodium silicate :

:2 NaOH + SiO2 → Na2SiO3 + H2O 

The other components of Bauxite, however, do not dissolve. Sometimes lime is added at this stage to precipitate the silica as calcium silicate. The solution is clarified by filtering off the solid impurities, commonly with a rotary sand trap and with the aid of a flocculant such as starch, to remove the fine particles. The undissolved waste after the aluminium compounds are extracted, bauxite tailings, contains iron oxides, silica, calcia, titania and some unreacted alumina. The original process was that the alkaline solution was cooled and treated by bubbling carbon dioxide through it, a method by which aluminium hydroxide precipitates:

:2 NaAlO2 + 3 H2O + CO2 → 2 Al(OH)3 + Na2CO3

But later, this gave way to seeding the supersaturated solution with high-purity aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3) crystal, which eliminated the need for cooling the liquid and was more economically feasible:

:2 H2O + NaAlO2 → Al(OH)3 + NaOH

Some of the aluminium hydroxide produced is used in the manufacture of water treatment chemicals such as aluminium sulfate, PAC (Polyaluminium chloride) or sodium aluminate; a significant amount is also used as a filler in rubber and plastics as a fire retardant. Some 90% of the gibbsite produced is converted into aluminium oxide, Al2O3, by heating in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to a temperature of about .

:2 Al(OH)3 → Al2O3 + 3 H2O

The left-over, &#x27;spent&#x27; sodium aluminate solution is then recycled. Apart from improving the economy of the process, recycling accumulates gallium and vanadium impurities in the liquors, so that they can be extracted profitably.

Organic impurities that accumulate during the precipitation of gibbsite may cause various problems, for example high levels of undesirable materials in the gibbsite, discoloration of the liquor and of the gibbsite, losses of the caustic material, and increased viscosity and density of the working fluid.

For bauxites having more than 10% silica, the Bayer process becomes uneconomic because of the formation of insoluble sodium aluminium silicate, which reduces yield, so another process must be chosen.

 of bauxite (corresponding to about 90% of the alumina content of the bauxite) is required to produce of aluminium oxide. This is due to a majority of the aluminium in the ore being dissolved in the process. Energy consumption is between (depending on process), of which most is thermal energy. Over 90% (95-96%) of the aluminium oxide produced is used in the Hall–Héroult process to produce aluminium.

== Waste ==
Red mud is the waste product that is produced in the digestion of bauxite with sodium hydroxide. It has high calcium and sodium hydroxide content with a complex chemical composition, and accordingly is very caustic and a potential source of pollution. The amount of red mud produced is considerable, and this has led scientists and refiners to seek uses for it. It has received attention as a possible source of vanadium. Due to the low extraction yield much of the gallium ends up in the aluminium oxide as an impurity and in the red mud.

One use of red mud is in ceramic production. Red mud dries into a fine powder that contains iron, aluminium, calcium and sodium. It becomes a health risk when some plants use the waste to produce aluminium oxides.

In the United States, the waste is disposed in large impoundments, a sort of reservoir created by a dam. The impoundments are typically lined with clay or synthetic liners. The US does not approve of the use of the waste due to the danger it poses to the environment. The EPA identified high levels of arsenic and chromium in some red mud samples.

=== Ajka alumina plant accident ===
On October 4, 2010, the Ajka alumina plant in Hungary had an incident where the western dam of its red mud reservoir collapsed. The reservoir was filled with of a mixture of red mud and water with a pH of 12. The mixture was released into the valley of Torna river and flooded parts of the city of Devecser and the villages of Kolontár and Somlóvásárhely. The incident resulted in 10 deaths, more than a hundred injuries, and contamination in lakes and rivers.

==History==
In 1859, Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in France developed a method for making alumina by heating bauxite in sodium carbonate, , at , leaching the sodium aluminate formed with water, then precipitating aluminium hydroxide by carbon dioxide, , which was then filtered and dried. This process is known as the Deville–Pechiney process. In 1886, the Hall–Héroult electrolytic aluminium process was invented, and the cyanidation process was invented in 1887. 

The Bayer process was invented in 1888 by Carl Josef Bayer. Working in Saint Petersburg, Russia to develop a method for supplying alumina to the textile industry (it was used as a mordant in dyeing cotton), Bayer discovered in 1887 that the aluminium hydroxide that precipitated from alkaline solution was crystalline and could be easily filtered and washed, while that precipitated from acid medium by neutralization was gelatinous and difficult to wash. The industrial success of this process caused it to replace the Deville–Pechiney process, marking the birth of the modern field of hydrometallurgy.

The engineering aspects of the process were improved upon to decrease the cost starting in 1967 in Germany and Czechoslovakia. This was done by increasing the heat recovery and using large autoclaves and precipitation tanks. To more effectively use energy, heat exchangers and flash tanks were used and larger reactors decreased the amount of heat lost. Efficiency was increased by connecting the autoclaves to make operation more efficient.

Today, the process produces nearly all the world&#x27;s alumina supply as an intermediate step in aluminium production.

<text>Calan Gaeaf is the name of the first day of winter in Wales, observed on 1 November. The night before is Nos Galan Gaeaf or Noson Galan Gaeaf, an &quot;Ysbrydnos&quot; (&quot;spirit night&quot;) when spirits are abroad. Traditionally, people avoid churchyards, stiles, and crossroads, since spirits are thought to gather there. The term is first recorded in literature as &quot;Kalan Gayaf&quot; in the laws of Hywel Dda.

The same term, &quot;Kalan Gwav&quot;, is found in the Cornish language, and &quot;Kalan Goañv&quot; in Breton.

==Traditions==

=== Dancing ===
On &quot;Nos Calan Gaeaf&quot;, women and children would dance around a bonfire and everyone would write their names on, or otherwise mark, rocks and place them in and around said fire. When the fire started to die out, they would all run home, believing if they stayed, Yr Hwch Ddu Gwta (a bad omen that took the form of a tailless black sow with a headless woman) or Y Ladi Wen (&quot;the white lady&quot;, a ghostly apparition often said to be headless) would chase them or devour their souls.

One particular rhyme shows how the last child out on &quot;Nos Calan Gaeaf&quot; was at risk of being eaten by the fearsome beast:
The following morning, all the stones containing villagers&#x27; names would be checked, and finding one&#x27;s stone burned clean was believed to be good luck. If, however, a stone was missing, the person who wrote their name on the absent stone would be believed to die within one year.

=== Harvest mare ===
&quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot; is a harvest festival and many games would be played involving the harvest. When the last corn stalk was harvested, workers would leave a few stalks uncut and then play a game with the uncut stalks to see who could reap them. Once the final corn stalks were cut, the stalks were twisted into something called a &quot;harvest mare.&quot; The winner would stuff the harvest mare inside his clothing and try to sneak it into the house while the women worked on the feast. If the reaper successfully got the harvest mare into the house, he was rewarded. If he was unsuccessful, he was mocked.

=== Feast ===
After the harvest was gathered and the livestock was slaughtered, a large feast would be held that was cooked by all the women in the village.

=== Seeing the future ===

* The boys were instructed to cut 10 leaves of ivy, throw one away and put the other nine under their pillows. Apparently, this allowed the boys to see the future, and if they touched the ivy then they could see witches while asleep.
* The girls were instructed to grow a rose in the shape of a large hoop, go through the circle three times prior to cutting a rose, and then place the rose under their pillow. This allowed the girls to see into the future.
* Unmarried women were instructed to darken their rooms during &quot;Nos Calan Gaeaf&quot;, and then an unmarried woman could look into the mirror to see the face of the future groom. If a skull appeared in the mirror, the unmarried woman was meant to die within the year. If a future groom could not be seen, unmarried women were instructed to peel an apple and throw the skin over their shoulders. Apparently, the shape the apple skin made would show the first initial of her future husband.

===Terms===
*Coelcerth: A bonfire. This fire was often used as part of the tradition wherein families place stones with their names on it in the fire, and search for their stone in the ashes the next day. Any person whose stone is missing the next morning would die within the year.
*Yr Hwch Ddu Gwta: A fearsome spirit in the form of a tail-less black sow who roamed the countryside with a headless woman.
*Twco Fala: Apple bobbing
*Caseg Fedi: Harvest mare

<text>In cell biology, protein kinase A (PKA) is a family of serine-threonine kinase whose activity is dependent on cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). PKA is also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (). PKA has several functions in the cell, including regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism. It should not be confused with 5&#x27;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase).

== History ==
Protein kinase A, more precisely known as adenosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase, abbreviated to PKA, was discovered by chemists Edmond H. Fischer and Edwin G. Krebs in 1968. They won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for their work on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and how it relates to PKA activity.

PKA is one of the most widely researched protein kinases, in part because of its uniqueness; out of 540 different protein kinase genes that make up the human kinome, only one other protein kinase, casein kinase 2, is known to exist in a physiological tetrameric complex, meaning it consists of four subunits.

The diversity of mammalian PKA subunits was realized after Dr. Stan McKnight and others identified four possible catalytic subunit genes and four regulatory subunit genes. In 1991, Susan Taylor and colleagues crystallized the PKA Cα subunit, which revealed the bi-lobe structure of the protein kinase core for the very first time, providing a blueprint for all the other protein kinases in a genome (the kinome).

== Structure ==
When inactive, the PKA apoenzyme exists as a tetramer which consists of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunit contains the active site, a series of canonical residues found in protein kinases that bind and hydrolyse ATP, and a domain to bind the regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunit has domains to bind to cyclic AMP, a domain that interacts with catalytic subunit, and an auto inhibitory domain. There are two major forms of regulatory subunit; RI and RII. 

Mammalian cells have at least two types of PKAs: type I is mainly in the cytosol, whereas type II is bound via its regulatory subunits and special anchoring proteins, described in the anchorage section, to the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, and microtubules. In both types, once the catalytic subunits are freed and active, they can migrate into the nucleus (where they can phosphorylate transcription regulatory proteins), while the regulatory subunits remain in the cytoplasm. 

The following human genes encode PKA subunits:
* catalytic subunit – PRKACA, PRKACB, PRKACG
* regulatory subunit type I - PRKAR1A, PRKAR1B
* regulatory subunit type II - PRKAR2A, PRKAR2B

==Mechanism==
===Activation===
PKA is also commonly known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, because it has traditionally been thought to be activated through release of the catalytic subunits when levels of the second messenger called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, rise in response to a variety of signals. However, recent studies evaluating the intact holoenzyme complexes, including regulatory AKAP-bound signalling complexes, have suggested that the local sub cellular activation of the catalytic activity of PKA might proceed without physical separation of the regulatory and catalytic components, especially at physiological concentrations of cAMP. In contrast, experimentally induced supra physiological concentrations of cAMP, meaning higher than normally observed in cells, are able to cause separation of the holoenzymes, and release of the catalytic subunits.

Extracellular hormones, such as glucagon and epinephrine, begin an intracellular signalling cascade that triggers protein kinase A activation by first binding to a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) on the target cell. When a GPCR is activated by its extracellular ligand, a conformational change is induced in the receptor that is transmitted to an attached intracellular heterotrimeric G protein complex by protein domain dynamics. The Gs alpha subunit of the stimulated G protein complex exchanges GDP for GTP in a reaction catalyzed by the GPCR and is released from the complex. The activated Gs alpha subunit binds to and activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP, directly increasing the cAMP level. Four cAMP molecules are able to bind to the two regulatory subunits. This is done by two cAMP molecules binding to each of the two cAMP binding sites (CNB-B and CNB-A) which induces a conformational change in the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing the subunits to detach and unleash the two, now activated, catalytic subunits.

Once released from inhibitory regulatory subunit, the catalytic subunits can go on to phosphorylate a number of other proteins in the minimal substrate context Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr., although they are still subject to other layers of regulation, including modulation by the heat stable pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKA, termed PKI.

Below is a list of the steps involved in PKA activation:

# Cytosolic cAMP increases
# Two cAMP molecules bind to each PKA regulatory subunit
# The regulatory subunits move out of the active sites of the catalytic subunits and the R2C2 complex dissociates
# The free catalytic subunits interact with proteins to phosphorylate Ser or Thr residues.

===Catalysis===
The liberated catalytic subunits can then catalyze the transfer of ATP terminal phosphates to protein substrates at serine, or threonine residues. This phosphorylation usually results in a change in activity of the substrate. Since PKAs are present in a variety of cells and act on different substrates, PKA regulation and cAMP regulation are involved in many different pathways.

The mechanisms of further effects may be divided into direct protein phosphorylation and protein synthesis:
*In direct protein phosphorylation, PKA directly either increases or decreases the activity of a protein.
*In protein synthesis, PKA first directly activates CREB, which binds the cAMP response element (CRE), altering the transcription and therefore the synthesis of the protein. In general, this mechanism takes more time (hours to days).

===Phosphorylation mechanism===
The Serine/Threonine residue of the substrate peptide is orientated in such a way that the hydroxyl group faces the gamma phosphate group of the bound ATP molecule. Both the substrate, ATP, and two Mg2+ ions form intensive contacts with the catalytic subunit of PKA. In the active conformation, the C helix packs against the N-terminal lobe and the Aspartate residue of the conserved DFG motif chelates the Mg2+ ions, assisting in positioning the ATP substrate. The triphosphate group of ATP points out of the adenosine pocket for the transfer of gamma-phosphate to the Serine/Threonine of the peptide substrate. There are several conserved residues, include Glutamate (E) 91 and Lysine (K) 72, that mediate the positioning of alpha- and beta-phosphate groups. The hydroxyl group of the peptide substrate&#x27;s Serine/Threonine attacks the gamma phosphate group at the phosphorus via an SN2 nucleophilic reaction, which results in the transfer of the terminal phosphate to the peptide substrate and cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between the beta-phosphate and the gamma-phosphate groups. PKA acts as a model for understanding protein kinase biology, with the position of the conserved residues helping to distinguish the active protein kinase and inactive pseudokinase members of the human kinome.

=== Inactivation ===

Downregulation of protein kinase A occurs by a feedback mechanism and uses a number of cAMP hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which belong to the substrates activated by PKA. Phosphodiesterase quickly converts cAMP to AMP, thus reducing the amount of cAMP that can activate protein kinase A. PKA is also regulated by a complex series of phosphorylation events, which can include modification by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by regulatory kinases, such as PDK1.

Thus, PKA is controlled, in part, by the levels of cAMP. Also, the catalytic subunit itself can be down-regulated by phosphorylation.

=== Anchorage ===
The regulatory subunit dimer of PKA is important for localizing the kinase inside the cell. The dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of the dimer binds to the A-kinase binding (AKB) domain of A-kinase anchor protein (AKAP). The AKAPs localize PKA to various locations (e.g., plasma membrane, mitochondria, etc.) within the cell.

AKAPs bind many other signaling proteins, creating a very efficient signaling hub at a certain location within the cell. For example, an AKAP located near the nucleus of a heart muscle cell would bind both PKA and phosphodiesterase (hydrolyzes cAMP), which allows the cell to limit the productivity of PKA, since the catalytic subunit is activated once cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits.

== Function ==
PKA phosphorylates proteins that have the motif Arginine-Arginine-X-Serine exposed, in turn (de)activating the proteins. Many possible substrates of PKA exist; a list of such substrates is available and maintained by the NIH.

As protein expression varies from cell type to cell type, the proteins that are available for phosphorylation will depend upon the cell in which PKA is present. Thus, the effects of PKA activation vary with cell type:

===Overview table===
=== In adipocytes and hepatocytes ===
Epinephrine and glucagon affect the activity of protein kinase A by changing the levels of cAMP in a cell via the G-protein mechanism, using adenylate cyclase. Protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate many enzymes important in metabolism. For example, protein kinase A phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Such covalent modification has an inhibitory effect on these enzymes, thus inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting net gluconeogenesis. Insulin, on the other hand, decreases the level of phosphorylation of these enzymes, which instead promotes lipogenesis. Recall that gluconeogenesis does not occur in myocytes.

===In nucleus accumbens neurons===
PKA helps transfer/translate the dopamine signal into cells in the nucleus accumbens, which mediates reward, motivation, and task salience. The vast majority of reward perception involves neuronal activation in the nucleus accumbens, some examples of which include sex, recreational drugs, and food. Protein Kinase A signal transduction pathway helps in modulation of ethanol consumption and its sedative effects. A mouse study reports that mice with genetically reduced cAMP-PKA signalling results into less consumption of ethanol and are more sensitive to its sedative effects.

=== In skeletal muscle ===
PKA is directed to specific sub-cellular locations after tethering to AKAPs. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) co-localizes with the muscle AKAP and RyR phosphorylation and efflux of Ca2+ is increased by localization of PKA at RyR by AKAPs.

=== In cardiac muscle ===
In a cascade mediated by a GPCR known as β1 adrenoceptor, activated by catecholamines (notably norepinephrine), PKA gets activated and phosphorylates numerous targets, namely: L-type calcium channels, phospholamban, troponin I, myosin binding protein C, and potassium channels. This increases inotropy as well as lusitropy, increasing contraction force as well as enabling the muscles to relax faster.

=== In memory formation ===
PKA has always been considered important in formation of a memory. In the fruit fly, reductions in expression activity of DCO (PKA catalytic subunit encoding gene) can cause severe learning disabilities, middle term memory and short term memory. Long term memory is dependent on the CREB transcription factor, regulated by PKA. A study done on drosophila reported that an increase in PKA activity can affect short term memory. However, a decrease in PKA activity by 24% inhibited learning abilities and a decrease by 16% affected both learning ability and memory retention. Formation of a normal memory is highly sensitive to PKA levels.

He has served two stints as Senate minority leader, from 2017 to 2021 and since 2025. He became New York&#x27;s senior senator in 2001, upon Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#x27;s retirement. Elected to a fifth term in 2022, Schumer surpassed Moynihan and Jacob K. Javits as the longest-serving U.S. senator from New York. He is the dean of New York&#x27;s congressional delegation.

A native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Schumer was a three-term member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1980. He served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1999, first representing New York&#x27;s 16th congressional district before being redistricted to the 10th congressional district in 1983 and 9th congressional district 10 years later. In 1998, Schumer was elected to the Senate, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Al D&#x27;Amato. He was reelected in 2004 with 71% of the vote, in 2010 with 66% of the vote, in 2016 with 70% of the vote, and in 2022 with 56% of the vote.

Schumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, overseeing 14 Democratic gains in the Senate in the 2006 and 2008 elections. He was the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, behind Senate majority leader Harry Reid and majority whip Dick Durbin. He served as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus in the Senate from 2007 to 2017 and chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee from 2011 to 2017. Schumer won his fourth term in the Senate in 2016 and was then unanimously elected Democratic leader to succeed Reid, who was retiring.

In January 2021, Schumer became Senate majority leader, becoming the first Jewish Senate leader in U.S. history. As majority leader, Schumer shepherded through the Senate some of the Biden administration&#x27;s major legislative initiatives, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Respect for Marriage Act. Under his leadership, the Senate confirmed the most federal judges during the first two years of any presidency since John F. Kennedy&#x27;s, and the most diverse slate of federal judicial nominations in American history, including Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
==Early life and education (1950–1974)==
Schumer was born on November 23, 1950, in Midwood, Brooklyn, the son of Selma (née Rosen) and Abraham Schumer. His father ran an exterminating business, and his mother was a homemaker. He and his family are Jewish, and he is a second cousin, once removed, of comedian Amy Schumer. His ancestors originated from the town of Chortkiv, Galicia, in what is now western Ukraine.

Schumer attended Brooklyn public schools, scoring 1600 on the SAT and graduating as the valedictorian of James Madison High School in 1967. He competed for Madison High on the television quiz show &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;. He attended Harvard College, where he originally majored in chemistry before switching to social studies after volunteering on Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1968. After graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa in 1971, Schumer attended Harvard Law School, earning his Juris Doctor with honors in 1974. He passed the New York state bar in early 1975, but never practiced law, opting rather for a career in politics.

==Early career (1975–1998)==

In 1974, Schumer ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly, filling a seat previously held by Schumer&#x27;s mentor, U.S. representative Stephen Solarz. Schumer served three terms, from 1975 to 1981, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures.

In 1980, 16th district U.S. representative Elizabeth Holtzman won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat of Republican Jacob Javits. Schumer ran for Holtzman&#x27;s vacated House seat and won. He was reelected eight times from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was numbered the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993, and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, as a result of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with Solarz, but the matchup did not materialize. In preparation, Schumer &quot;set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city&#x27;s top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. &#x27;I told them I looked like I had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,&#x27; he would later tell the Associated Press.&quot;

Schumer introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (also known as RFRA) on March 11, 1993.

As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer was one of four members of Congress who oversaw the House investigation (leading the Democratic party&#x27;s defense of the Clinton administration), of the Waco siege hearings in 1995.

==U.S. Senate (1999–present)==

In 1998, Schumer ran for the Senate. He won the Democratic primary with 51% of the vote against Geraldine Ferraro (21%) and Mark Green (19%). He received 54% of the vote in the general election, defeating three-term incumbent Republican Al D&#x27;Amato (44%).

In 2004, Schumer was reelected with 71% of the vote, defeating the Republican nominee, Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown, and conservative Marilyn F. O&#x27;Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process. Schumer defeated Mills by 2.8 million votes. He won every county in the state except Hamilton County, in the Adirondacks, the least populous and most Republican county. Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.

An April 2009 SurveyUSA poll placed Schumer&#x27;s approval rating at 62%, with 31% disapproving.

Notable former aides to Schumer include former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, former New York State Senator Daniel Squadron, and New York state assemblymembers Phil Goldfeder and Victor M. Pichardo.

After the 2016 presidential election, Schumer said the Democratic Party lost due to not having &quot;a strong, bold economic message&quot; and called on Democrats to push for reforms in the affordability of college and trade laws.

===Senate Democratic Leader===
The Senate Democratic Caucus elected Schumer minority leader in November 2016. Schumer had been widely expected to lead Senate Democrats after Reid announced his retirement in 2015. He is the first New Yorker, as well as the first Jewish person, to serve as a Senate leader. On January 20, 2021, Democrats gained control of the Senate with the swearing-in of newly elected Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, following the 2020–21 election runoff and special election runoff, making Schumer the majority leader, replacing Republican Mitch McConnell.

===Political style===
Schumer&#x27;s propensity for publicity is the subject of a running joke among many commentators. He has been called an &quot;incorrigible publicity hound&quot;. Bob Dole once quipped, &quot;the most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera&quot;; Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought the press to a banquet as his &quot;loved ones&quot;. Schumer often schedules media appearances on Sundays. Some have cited his use of media as a successful way to raise a politician&#x27;s profile nationally and among his constituents. Schumer has appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; seven times.

In Washington, Schumer has been a lead consensus-builder on the difficult issues of health care, immigration, and financial regulation.

As chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the second inauguration of Barack Obama, Schumer played a key role in organizing the event, gave the opening speech and served as master of ceremonies. A photograph of a smiling Schumer peering from behind Malia Obama as Obama took the oath of office went viral and became a meme. Although it was called a &quot;photobomb&quot;, it was not technically one as he was standing in the correct place. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; quipped, &quot;clearly, inauguration day belonged to Chuck Schumer.&quot;

===Local issues===
Schumer prides himself on visiting each of New York&#x27;s 62 counties every year and has done so in each of the years he has served in the Senate, the only New York senator to have done so. He has a reputation for focusing on local issues important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism to local taxes to job creation. When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant.

When it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate that New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island. Along with his House and Senate colleagues, Schumer successfully worked to kill a Bush-era privatization plan for custodial and utility workers at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The plan would have called for turning over custodial and utility work to a Georgia company.

In November 2017, Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $1,908,486 in funding for Head Start and Early Head Start programs at the Community Action Organization of Erie County, Schumer saying the federal funding would yield &quot;real results to young students in Western New York by providing them with the resources they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom&quot;.

In January 2018, Schumer requested that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs complete final acquisitions for two 60-acre and 77-acre parcels in Pembroke, New York, and initiate construction of the New Western New York National Veterans Cemetery, saying the completion of the cemetery would ensure &quot;Western New York&#x27;s military veterans will have the proper burial, at a site close to the homes, families, and the very communities they dedicated their lives to defend and serve.&quot;

===Drugs===
In May 2001, Schumer and Senator John McCain introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market. A coalition of consumer groups supported the legislation and Schumer told reporters its enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60% per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71billion over the next decade.

In October 2001, during a press conference, Schumer stated his desire that generic ciprofloxacin be available for government use. At that time, Bayer held exclusive patent rights for its commercial product, Cipro. Schumer also said he believed the federal government had the authority to order the immediate production of generic ciproflaxin to expand the government stockpile of the drug.

In July 2002, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Schumer and McCain that could lower the costs of generic drugs more rapidly available to U.S. consumers and thereby lead to savings of billions of dollars in drug costs. The legislation also attempted to prevent frivolous lawsuits by brand-name drug manufacturers claiming generic drugs infringed their patents. An identical bill was introduced in the House but did not pass.

===FBI===
In November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York senator Hillary Clinton to call for legislation encouraging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York mayor Rudy Giuliani that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of. Schumer joined Patrick Leahy to report that the Justice Department supported the legislation.

In October 2016, after FBI director James Comey announced the reopening of an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, mishandled classified emails during her tenure at the State Department, Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey. In May 2017, after President Donald Trump fired Comey, Schumer told reporters they were aware the FBI had been investigating whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and pondered whether the investigation was &quot;getting too close to home for the president&quot;. In a Senate floor speech, Schumer called for a &quot;impartial and independent&quot; investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, announcing the Democrats had agreed that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would not be able to appoint a special prosecutor for an investigation into Russia&#x27;s meddling; that Comey meet with the Senate; and that Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions meet separately with senators.

In January 2018, Schumer said that since Mueller&#x27;s investigation began, the United States &quot;has had to endure conspiracy after conspiracy from the right wing, Republican congressmen, senators and of course the right-wing press, which acts in total cahoots&quot; in regard to their views on the FBI, and that the Republicans&#x27; effort to discredit Mueller &quot;has now devolved into delusional, self-serving paranoia&quot;. In May, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who made contact with the Trump campaign, Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Christopher A. Wray calling for &quot;a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers&quot;.

===Supreme Court===

In September 2005, after President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States, Schumer praised Roberts&#x27;s brilliance, his being &quot;a lawyer above all&quot;, and his &quot;judicial philosophy and modesty and stability&quot; during the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s confirmation hearings for Roberts. But Schumer said Roberts&#x27;s &quot;compassion and humanity&quot; was questionable, and objected to the Bush administration&#x27;s refusal to show documents Roberts wrote during his tenure as deputy solicitor general and to Roberts&#x27;s refusal to answer many questions the committee asked him. In June 2018, Schumer said Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it became more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California. Schumer said the court had &quot;affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act&quot; and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called &quot;the hard right&quot;.

In October 2005, Schumer said Bush Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers &quot;would not get a majority either in the Judiciary Committee or the floor&quot; and that her confirmation hearings would cause her to gather either support or opposition in a way that had not been seen by any other nominee in recent memory.

In May 2009, he told reporters the confirmation process for Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor would be &quot;more of a test of the Republican Party than it is of Judge Sotomayor&quot;, calling Sotomayor a &quot;mainstream justice&quot; whom Republicans had no reason to oppose.

In March 2016, after Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia, Schumer called for Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley to hold hearings &quot;so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court&quot;. In July 2018, it was reported Schumer had advocated that Trump nominate Garland as a way to attract bipartisan support, as opposed to nominating someone opposed to the Affordable Care Act and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; who would be more controversial. In November 2016, Schumer said the Democrats would &quot;go at&quot; President-elect Trump if he did not nominate Supreme Court justices who were mainstream and the Republicans did not have &quot;clean hands&quot; for having blocked the Garland nomination for months.

In March 2017, at the end of Senate hearings for Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Schumer said he would vote against confirmation and called on Democrats to join him in blocking an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. In his floor speech, Schumer said, &quot;If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes—a bar met by each of President Obama&#x27;s nominees and George Bush&#x27;s last two nominees—the answer isn&#x27;t to change the rules. It&#x27;s to change the nominee.&quot; The Democrats conducted the filibuster, but Republicans broke it using the &quot;nuclear option&quot;, and Gorsuch was confirmed the next day.

In July 2018, after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy, Schumer said Kavanaugh should be asked direct questions about the precedent set by &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and other cases. Schumer noted Kavanaugh&#x27;s expressed opinion on the possible incorrect decision in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot; and that this could mean he would not hold Trump accountable as a justice.

On August 21, Schumer said he was requesting that documents from Kavanaugh&#x27;s White House tenure be shared with the Senate, arguing that &quot;withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under the bogus label of committee confidential is a dark development for the Senate.&quot; After meeting with Kavanaugh, Schumer said he had asked him whether he believed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Casey v. Planned Parenthood&quot; were properly decided and that Kavanaugh had not responded and the lack of an answer &quot;should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women&quot;. He also said Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views clear due to his unique position as the only person nominated to the Supreme Court by a president who said, &quot;I will only nominate someone who overturns &quot;Roe v Wade&quot;.&quot; Schumer subsequently called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay Kavanaugh&#x27;s confirmation hearing after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance law violations, calling the plea &quot;a game changer&quot;.

==== 2020 comments about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch ====
In March 2020, Schumer was criticized for statements he made about Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by Trump. At a rally outside the United States Capitol while the Supreme Court was hearing an abortion-related case, Schumer said that if Kavanaugh and Gorsuch voted against abortion rights, they would have &quot;unleashed a whirlwind&quot; and would &quot;pay the price&quot;. He then said, &quot;You won&#x27;t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.&quot; Republicans and Democrats, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, condemned these comments as inciting violence. Senator Josh Hawley called for a censure. A spokesman for Schumer said the comments were in reference to the political price Senate Republicans would pay, and criticized Roberts for following a &quot;right-wing&quot; attack to misinterpret the comments. Schumer later apologized for the comments.

In February 2025, interim U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. Ed Martin announced the Department of Justice was launching an investigation into the matter.

===Net neutrality===
In November 2017, Schumer said, &quot;Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, net neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century. To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people. It is a disaster.&quot; In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer said the internet could start resembling &quot;a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private &#x27;fast lanes&#x27; while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites&quot;, and that the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote.

In January 2018, Schumer announced all 49 members of the Democratic caucus supported a resolution overturning the FCC vote on net neutrality and said congressional Republicans &quot;have the opportunity to right the administration&#x27;s wrong and show the American people whose side they&#x27;re on: big ISPs&#x27; and major corporations&#x27; or consumers&#x27;, entrepreneurs&#x27;, and small business owners&#x27;.&quot; In May, the Senate adopted a measure to revive Obama-era internet regulations enforcing equal treatment for all web traffic. Schumer called the vote &quot;our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans&quot;. In June, in response to the Republican-controlled House not taking up the Senate resolution restoring net neutrality rules, Schumer said, &quot;House Republican leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet.&quot;

==Political positions==
===Abortion===
Schumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.

In 2002, Schumer authored a provision to an industry-sponsored bill intended to make it harder for people to erase their debts by filing for bankruptcy. Anti-abortion activists opposed the measure, claiming it restricted their ability to use bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. After the bill appeared to die in May, J. Dennis Hastert spokesman John Feehery opined, &quot;Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up.&quot; In response, Schumer said the provision was a compromise with Henry Hyde and other colleagues and it was opposed by people who did not properly read the law.

After Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018, Schumer voiced concern about Trump&#x27;s choice of replacement, believing they would try to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

===Agriculture===
In March 2019, Schumer was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S. secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers &quot;have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices&quot; and urging his department to &quot;strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program&quot;.

===Bicycle safety===
Schumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn. In 2011, he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park. They attempted to remove a new &quot;parking-protected&quot; bicycle path on their street, which ran adjacent to the curb, with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane. While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife, Iris Weinshall, is a prominent opponent of the project, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Schumer has lobbied against the bike path behind the scenes. In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the project, drawing criticism.

===Bush administration judicial nominations===
In January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering to the federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering&#x27;s confirmation and said the US could do better.

In 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey to become attorney general of the United States (replacing Gonzales, who had resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey&#x27;s refusal to declare in public that waterboarding was illegal torture, Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey. He said Mukasey had assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal, and that Mukasey had told him Bush would have &quot;no legal authority&quot; to ignore such a law.

===Cannabis===

In April 2018, Schumer said that he would back efforts to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level. On April 20, a day known as 4/20, he announced his sponsorship of legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would also provide funding for women and minority-owned businesses and for research into the public health effects of cannabis. On June 27, 2018, Schumer formally introduced the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act.

On July 14, 2021, Schumer, along with Senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker, released for public comment a comprehensive federal legalization bill known as the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act. On July 21, 2022, he formally introduced the bill.

===Clinton impeachment===
Schumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress. Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting &quot;no&quot; on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted &quot;not guilty&quot; on the two impeachment charges.

===Consumer issues===
Schumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues. He passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates. This standardized information is now known as the &quot;Schumer box&quot;. Schumer has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, one by their own bank and one by the bank that owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their bank&#x27;s network.

With Representative Nita Lowey, Schumer has been working to ban the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), often found in baby bottles and plastic children&#x27;s food containers. The Canadian government has already banned BPA in baby bottles and children&#x27;s products. Schumer is also seeking a ban on the use of cadmium, a carcinogen known to impair brain development in children, in toys and children&#x27;s jewelry. When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the 2009 swine flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation. In the end, the FTC put ten companies on notice and identified a total of 140 scams.

Schumer has championed college tuition tax credits, calling for and passing a $4,000 tuition tax credit for students as part of a host of tax credits and cuts passed to stimulate the economy in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.

Schumer received an &quot;A&quot; grade on the 2008 Drum Major Institute&#x27;s Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.

In October 2013, Schumer announced his support for a proposal ending restrictions on shipping beer, wine, and spirits through the U.S. Postal Service, saying it would &quot;help keep local post offices open by bringing in an estimated $225million in new revenues to the USPS&quot; and broaden the availability of beers and wines to consumers.

===Death penalty===
In 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be &quot;appropriate&quot; in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. &quot;The federal law allows the death penalty... I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House. This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to.&quot;

===Disaster relief===
In 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York, as a result of the devastating flood there in 2009. A flash flood devastated the village, causing two deaths. Four feet of flood waters swept through the village, and caused much damage. Gowanda was declared both a state and federal disaster site.

Of the anticipated disbursement of FEMA monies to Gowanda, Schumer said:

===Donald Trump===

In a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks after Trump&#x27;s election to the presidency, Schumer said that he and Trump were not friends and had had &quot;civil conversations a couple of times&quot; when Trump had contacted him. Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was &quot;close to Schumer in many ways&quot;. In December 2016, Schumer called on Trump cabinet nominees to release their tax returns and in doing so follow the precedent set by Steve Mnuchin and Tom Price.

In February 2017, before Trump&#x27;s speech to a joint session of Congress, Schumer predicted that the speech would be less memorable than ones delivered by Trump&#x27;s predecessors due to what he called &quot;a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working Americans&quot;. Though acknowledging Trump&#x27;s populist campaigning style, Schumer said Trump &quot;governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue&quot;.

In March 2017, Schumer released a statement calling on Trump to apologize for claiming the Obama administration had wiretapped him during his presidential campaign. He advocated that Trump stop tweeting to better focus on working on behalf of the United States and said Trump had &quot;severely damaged his credibility&quot; by promoting conspiracy theories.

In June 2018, Schumer delivered a Senate floor speech decrying Representative Maxine Waters&#x27;s call to harass members of the Trump administration as protest of the administration&#x27;s policies: &quot;I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don&#x27;t agree with you. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That&#x27;s not right. That&#x27;s not American.&quot;

In August 2018, in response to Trump&#x27;s charge that American Jews who vote for Democrats are &quot;disloyal&quot;, Schumer tweeted, &quot;When he [Trump] uses a trope that&#x27;s been used against the Jewish people for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging—wittingly or unwittingly—anti-Semites throughout the country and world.&quot;

Schumer was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Schumer and other members of Congress were removed from the Senate chambers. He and Mitch McConnell joined Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer in an undisclosed location. As the attack persisted, Schumer and Pelosi released a joint statement calling on Trump to demand the rioters leave the Capitol and its grounds immediately. When the Senate reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Schumer gave remarks, calling it a day &quot;that will live forever in infamy&quot;. Later that day, he blamed Trump for the attack, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. He also said he would support impeachment.

===Election reform===
In March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans&#x27; believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature.

===Equal pay===
In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), a bill aimed at addressing the gender pay gap in the United States. Republicans argued that the Democrats were attempting to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections. Schumer backed the measure and told reporters, &quot;pay equity, that&#x27;s women, that&#x27;s 53 percent of the vote&quot;.

===Financial industry regulation===
In 1987, then-Representative Schumer wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed opposing repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Banks Become Casinos&quot;. In 1999, Schumer supported Congress&#x27;s repeal of Glass–Steagall, saying: &quot;There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive.&quot; Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer&#x27;s senatorial campaigns.

According to a December 14, 2008, &quot;New York Times&quot; article on Schumer&#x27;s role in the Wall Street meltdown, he embraced the industry&#x27;s free-market, deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, backing measures blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in taxes or fees. The article claimed that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies the George W. Bush administration and the SEC had proposed.

The Charles Schumer-Rob Portman Senate bill of 2015 proposed to tax the $2.2trillion multinational corporations are holding outside the country in tax-haven subsidiaries, on which 35% was already owed, as a one-time tax &quot;at a rate significantly lower than the statutory corporate rate&quot;.

In his book released in March 2010, &quot;No One Would Listen&quot;, Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos passed along an unsourced claim that Schumer called the SEC for information about the Madoff investigation. Schumer denied this.

In response to &quot;The American Prospect&#x27;s&quot; Day One Agenda, Schumer announced a new stance on eliminating student debt. In November 2020, he said, &quot;I have a proposal with Elizabeth Warren that the first $50,000 of debt be vanquished, and we believe that Joe Biden can do that with the pen as opposed to legislation&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
In 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland&#x27;s release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi&#x27;s release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya.

In April 2017, after the Shayrat missile strike, Schumer said a &quot;pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate&quot; while warning against the United States becoming further involved in Syria.

In July 2017, Schumer voted for the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

In July 2018, after Trump criticized Germany&#x27;s decision to approve a new Russian-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea bypassing Poland and Ukraine, Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi released a joint statement condemning Trump&#x27;s comments as an embarrassment and his behavior as &quot;another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies&quot;.

In October 2020, Schumer called on the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan, sent through the Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;building partner assistance program&quot;. According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He co-signed a letter stating: We have been very critical of U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan given the country&#x27;s human rights record and aggression in the region. Earlier this year, at Senator Menendez&#x27;s request, the Government Accountability Office agreed to conduct a review of security assistance to the country to ensure that it aligns with U.S. interests; this violence indicates that it does not.

====Afghanistan====
In March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S. ports, an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring a company from operating in a U.S. port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban&#x27;s regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure. Senate majority leader Bill Frist subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had &quot;bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule&quot; and that Frist&#x27;s move meant Republicans did not want a vote at all.

In October 2009, Schumer said, &quot;It cost us $6 trillion and 4,500 lives, approximately, to bring stability to Iraq. Just in terms of the loss of life and treasure, do we want to do the same exercise in Afghanistan?&quot; He said the United States could potentially be able to keep itself safe without bringing stability to Afghanistan and advocated that American forces be scaled back in Afghanistan in favor of more reliance on unmanned drone attacks.

In April 2017, Schumer called for caution in Afghanistan, noting the casualties in Iraq, and said the military would have to come to Congress if it wanted more American soldiers in Afghanistan.

====China====
In 2006, NPR reported that Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham were highly critical of the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, and its alleged cause of Chinese currency intervention.

In 2017, Schumer wrote to Trump advocating for a block on China that would prevent it from purchasing more American companies to increase pressure on Beijing to help rein in North Korea&#x27;s nuclear missile program. In May 2018, after Trump signaled his willingness to ease sanctions on ZTE in a bid for a trade deal with Beijing, Schumer observed, &quot;This seems to be an area where Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are coming together and telling the president, you&#x27;ve got to be tough on China, you have to have your actions match your rhetoric.&quot;

Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Schumer and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China. Schumer said, &quot;China has stolen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars [but] administrations from both parties haven&#x27;t been strong enough to fight back.&quot;

In October 2023, Schumer led a bipartisan congressional delegation&#x27;s visit to China that included a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. In a press conference, Schumer said the two sides spoke about their &quot;respective priorities&quot; and that he told Xi that &quot;America wants fairness and stability. At the foundation of the relationship must be a level playing field for American businesses and workers, as well as responsible competition&quot;. The delegation also met Foreign Minister Wang Yi, National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji, and Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining.

====Iran nuclear deal====
On August 6, 2015, Schumer announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran. He planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an &quot;apparent attempt to limit coverage&quot;. Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer&#x27;s decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities. In what &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as a &quot;shot across Schumer&#x27;s bow&quot;, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer&#x27;s decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.

====Iraq====
Schumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution but was very critical of President George W. Bush&#x27;s strategy in the Iraq War; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.

In April 2002, during a Senate speech, Schumer called the Bush administration&#x27;s Middle East policy &quot;muddled, confused and inconsistent&quot; and said the planned meeting between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Yasser Arafat would contradict Bush&#x27;s stated stand against terrorists and those harboring them. Nat Hentoff of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote in November 2006 that &quot;the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration&#x27;s war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties&quot;, particularly on the issue of torture.

In July 2006, Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iraq was urging the international community &quot;to take a quick and firm stance to stop this aggression against Lebanon, to stop the killing of innocent people and to stop the destruction of infrastructure&quot;. In response, Schumer, Harry Reid, and Dick Durbin signed a letter to al-Maliki in which they charged him with failing to condemn the aggression of Hezbollah as well as Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself, arguing the oversight raised serious concern about whether Iraq under his rule could &quot;play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East&quot;.

Schumer was the first senator to call for U.S. support for Kurdish independence after the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, releasing a resolution calling for the U.S. government to change its policy to &quot;support a political process that addresses the aspirations of the Kurds for an independent state&quot;. He called upon Iraq to &quot;engage in a dialogue and peacefully determine the best way to accommodate the well-deserved and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi Kurds&quot;.

====Israel====
In 1994, Schumer joined the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress in a campaign to get the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation, which by the time it was shut down in 2001 was the country&#x27;s largest Muslim charity.

In June 2010, while speaking at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C., Schumer made comments about Israel&#x27;s blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized. He pointed to statistics to show that the Palestinian citizens of the West Bank were experiencing &quot;economic prosperity&quot;, crediting this to their government&#x27;s cooperation with the Israeli government on combating terrorists. He then criticized the Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip for voting for the Hamas militant organization, calling on Israel to &quot;strangle them economically until they see that&#x27;s not the way to go&quot;, while also stating that Israel should continue providing &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; to Palestinian civilians. He argued that the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified not only because it keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows Palestinians living there that &quot;when there&#x27;s some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement.&quot; Schumer added, &quot;The Palestinian people still don&#x27;t believe in a Jewish state, in a two-state solution. More do than before, but a majority still do not ... They don&#x27;t believe in the Torah. They don&#x27;t believe in King David. So they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s our land&quot;.

Schumer supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In March 2018, he told AIPAC&#x27;s delegates that Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have nothing to do with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Schumer is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement-building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. He criticized Obama, saying: &quot;past administrations—both Democrat and Republican—have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution [the U.N.]. Unfortunately, by abstaining on United Nations Resolution 2334, this administration has not followed in that path.&quot;

In May 2017, Schumer co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. The bill would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.

Schumer introduced a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.

In May 2018, Schumer praised Trump for opening the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, saying, &quot;I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago, and I applaud President Trump for doing it.&quot; He had previously accused Trump of &quot;indecisiveness&quot; for his delays in implementing the move by waiving the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, as previous presidents had done.

In a March 14, 2024, Senate speech, Schumer said Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was an impediment to peace in the Middle East and called for elections to replace him when the Israel–Hamas war abated. Schumer said the many civilian deaths in Gaza was causing international support for Israel to fall to historic lows. Netanyahu responded by arranging to address a Senate GOP conference by video.

====North Korea====
In February 2017, Schumer said that North Korea had proved itself to be &quot;an irresponsible nation in every way&quot; and that China could be used to curtail North Korea as most of North Korea&#x27;s imports and exports go through China. He advocated that the United States tell China &quot;they have to put the wood to North Korea in a much more serious way than they have done so far.&quot; In August, after Trump said North Korea would be &quot;met with fire and fury like the world has never seen&quot; in the event of continued threats against the United States, Schumer released a statement advocating that the United States be &quot;firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.&quot;

In May 2018, Schumer called for Kim Jong-un to be removed from the commemorative coin memorializing the 2018 North Korea–United States summit, calling Kim a &quot;brutal dictator&quot; and offering the Peace House as a more appropriate alternative. In June, Schumer was one of seven senior Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump outlining the conditions of their caucus&#x27;s support for any deal resulting from the North Korea-US summit. After Kim and Trump issued a joint statement, Schumer said the meeting between the two had given &quot;a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved&quot; and that the agreement lacked details on achieving a pathway to the Korean peninsula being denuclearized, how the United States would verify North Korea&#x27;s disarming, and an assurance of cessation for enrichment of plutonium and uranium from North Korea. In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer questioned what the United States had gained from the summit and added that the country had &quot;won far stronger language on denuclearization&quot; in previous agreements with North Korea. In response, Trump tweeted, Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home &amp; much more!

====Russia====
In a June 3, 2008, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran&#x27;s theocratic government. In discussing the importance of Russia&#x27;s cooperation, Schumer wrote, &quot;Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union.&quot; He added, &quot;The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin&#x27;s dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.&quot; On June 10, the East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter about his article, writing, &quot;As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under &#x27;Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe&#x27;, your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.&quot;

In August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, Schumer said Putin was behaving like a &quot;schoolyard bully&quot;, adding, &quot;The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this.&quot;

In December 2016, Schumer joined John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Jack Reed in a letter to Majority Leader McConnell urging the formation of a Senate select committee on cyber. Schumer said the panel would focus on Russian meddling and potential threats from other countries such as China and Iran.

In December 2016, Schumer demanded a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in U.S. affairs. In January 2017, in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments, he said, &quot;Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you&quot;. Later that month, he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.

In a May 2017 Senate floor speech, Schumer called on the White House to release unedited transcripts of the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the previous week, saying the continued confidentiality would ensure &quot;the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation&#x27;s most closely kept secrets.&quot; In July, Schumer disavowed claims that the Democratic Party considered Russia its top priority and named health care and economic stability for working-class families as its primary concerns. &quot;Obviously Russia is in the news. Obviously we want Bob Mueller to be able to pursue and our committees to be able to pursue their investigations unimpeded.&quot;

Schumer spearheaded a non-binding resolution in July 2018 &quot;warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials&quot;. The resolution stated the United States &quot;should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin&quot;. It passed 98–0.

===Gun laws===
In 1994, then-representative Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein authored the Assault Weapons Ban. Supporters of gun control legislation give Schumer much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.

While a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, &quot;Field and Stream&quot; magazine honored Schumer in its &quot;Hero Awards&quot; in 2008. He supports tax deductions for hunters who donate venison and other game to feeding programs. In response to a question at a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer denied having a handgun or a permit for one. He has produced a letter from the NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife, Iris Weinshall, has a handgun license from NYC. Schumer aide Brian Fallon said, &quot;except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one&quot;.

In February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Schumer was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump asserting that were he &quot;to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack&quot; and that there was no justification for allowing people denied firearms by federally licensed dealers to &quot;simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store&quot;.

In January 2019, Schumer was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, which would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

===Health care===
In March 2004, Schumer, Jon Corzine, Ted Kennedy, and Frank Lautenberg signed a letter to President Bush urging him to instruct staff to avoid taking action against whistleblower Richard Foster after Foster spoke out on the subject of White House efforts intended to keep Congress unaware of alternative higher cost estimates for the new Medicare prescription drug program.

Schumer supported Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009 and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

In 2009, Schumer proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to &quot;address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market&quot;. Schumer said he wanted &quot;a level playing field for competition&quot;.

In May 2017, in response to an amendment by Fred Upton to the American Health Care Act, Schumer released a statement saying the amendment &quot;leaves Americans with pre-existing conditions as vulnerable as they were before under this bill&quot; and compared it to &quot;administering cough medicine to someone with stage 4 cancer&quot;. After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed the American Health Care Act would cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, Schumer said, &quot;Republicans in Washington and the president should read this report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs for the American people.&quot; In June, Schumer sent McConnell a letter requesting that all senators meet to discuss the American Health Care Act, citing the need for both parties to &quot;come together to find solutions to America&#x27;s challenges&quot;. Later that month, Schumer estimated the bill had a 50% chance of passing the Senate and added that Democrats were doing everything they could to fight the measure, calling the legislation &quot;devastating for the middle class&quot;.

===Homeland security===
In 1995, Schumer sponsored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 (H.R. 896) in the House of Representatives.

As a senator, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for New York State and City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support New York&#x27;s security and recovery efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.

In November 2001, Schumer announced hearings on George W. Bush&#x27;s decision to try terrorists in military tribunals amid Washington concerns that Bush would skip the American legal system in handling such cases. Schumer said the hearing&#x27;s two goals were to ascertain whether Bush had the power to form a tribunal apart from an attempt at interacting with Congress and whether a military tribunal was the most efficient instrument.

In August 2004, after American officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Schumer said he was troubled by the decision to reveal Khan&#x27;s identity, citing the fact that the public had learned little of Khan&#x27;s role in providing the information that led Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to announce a higher terror alert level.

Schumer supported continuing to fully fund the FIRE Grant program the Federal Emergency Management Agency administered. The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.

In March 2018, Schumer said the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Bob Casey and Pat Toomey would assist the children of deceased first respondents afford college by increasing the availability of Pell grant funding.

In August 2018, Schumer announced that the Senate had passed $1 million in FY2019 funding for the national firefighter cancer registry as an amendment to the upcoming FY2019 Health and Human Services minibus appropriations bill. He said firefighters needed &quot;first-rate medical care and treatment&quot; for the work they did and the registry would help &quot;researchers track, treat, and eventually prevent firefighters being stricken by cancer&quot;.

===Immigration===
While discussing an immigration bill on the Senate floor in 2010, Schumer likened Indian tech giant Infosys Technologies to a &quot;chop shop&quot;. When his statement set off a wave of outrage in India, he acknowledged his characterization was incorrect. The remark was also called &quot;outrageous&quot; by U.S.-India Business Council head Ron Somers.

Schumer is one of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority—68-32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats—but the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.

In April 2012, Schumer introduced SB 1070, a bill that would kill Arizona&#x27;s anti-immigration law, and ones like it if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: &quot;States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply &#x27;helping the federal government&#x27; to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant.&quot;

In January 2018, Schumer stated that any agreement on the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals before its March expiration would have to be included in the spending bill. Schumer offered Trump congressional approval of more than $20 billion for his border wall in exchange for protecting recipients of DACA. Trump declined the offer. A week later, Schumer announced that conversations on immigration and border security were resuming between the White House and himself. In a March CNN op-ed, Schumer wrote that Trump had stood in the way of progress on &quot;compromise proposals that both sides should be proud of&quot; and charged Trump and the White House with using Dreamers as &quot;bargaining chips to push forward their anti-immigrant agenda&quot;. He called on Trump to change course and said Americans would be aware that he was behind the prevention of Congress from settling the matter. In June, before a planned meeting between Trump and House Republicans for discussions on the compromise immigration bill, Schumer warned that House moderates would lose credibility if they succumbed to pressure and enacted &quot;the hard right&#x27;s agenda&quot;.

===IndyMac Bank controversy===
On June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators about IndyMac Bank, the country&#x27;s seventh-largest savings and loan association and ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans, which he considered a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote that he was &quot;concerned that IndyMac&#x27;s financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.&quot; Many IndyMac depositors either panicked or, from another perspective, justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.

A Treasury Department&#x27;s Inspector General audit found that the primary causes of IndyMac&#x27;s failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac&#x27;s reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a &quot;run&quot; on the thrift after the public release of Schumer&#x27;s letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac&#x27;s demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.

Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) director John Reich immediately blamed IndyMac&#x27;s failure on the letter&#x27;s release. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a &quot;heart attack&quot;, saying, &quot;Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We&#x27;ll never know the answer to that question.&quot; Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amid a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.

Schumer conceded his actions might have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but said, &quot;if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac&#x27;s poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn&#x27;t be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs.&quot; He added, &quot;IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ... It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we&#x27;re now in.&quot;

Despite IndyMac&#x27;s condition before the failure, the financial media sharply criticized Schumer. CNBC financial analyst Jerry Bowyer charged that he was responsible for the &quot;second largest bank failure in US history&quot;. While opining that IndyMac&#x27;s failure was only a matter of time, banking consultant Bert Ely called Schumer&#x27;s actions &quot;wrong and irresponsible&quot;.

On October 18, 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an article suggesting that an investment company&#x27;s interest in IndyMac might have prompted Schumer&#x27;s letter. His reported close ties to the founders of OneWest Bank have long been of interest to many action groups. On December 22, 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the OTS regional director in charge had been removed from his position for allowing IndyMac to falsify its financial reporting. The same day, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh continued to blame Schumer and recast IndyMac&#x27;s July bankruptcy as an &quot;October Surprise&quot; planned by Democrats to help win the 2008 election.

===Same-sex marriage===

Schumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996. He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete.

In March 2009, Schumer announced his support for same-sex marriage, noting that it &quot;was time&quot;. He previously supported civil unions. At a private dinner with gay leaders on March 22, 2009, Schumer said he not only supported same-sex marriage, he also backed a full reversal of DOMA. When the New York State Senate took up a bill to legalize gay marriage in December 2009, Schumer and other statewide officials aggressively lobbied wavering senators to support the legislation.

===Student loan forgiveness===
Schumer supports the cancellation of $50,000 or more in federal student loan debt for every borrower by executive action.

===Subprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis===

In September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#x27;s conforming loan (&quot;affordable&quot;) limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.

After the March 2007 meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values. As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to move from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.

Schumer&#x27;s top nine campaign contributors are all financial institutions that have contributed over $2.5 million.

===Taxes on high incomes===
Schumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the mid-2000s, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Then serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income. But in 2010, he suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.

In February 2012, Schumer at first said he disagreed with the Obama administration&#x27;s call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar floor instead. According to Schumer, &quot;in large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that is associated with wealth.&quot; He later stood by the assertion but also said that raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 was necessary to bring in enough revenue.

===Technology and the Internet===
In June 2011, Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin sought a crackdown on Bitcoin, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. &quot;The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,&quot; which used the anonymizing network Tor. One opinion website said the senators wanted &quot;to disrupt [the] Silk Road drug website&quot;.

Schumer is a sponsor of S. 968, the controversial PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights. On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who also supported the bill. Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.

In March 2012, Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.

====Facebook====
Schumer has offered political support to Facebook, acting as an ally and seeking to advance the company&#x27;s interests in Senate debates about regulating it or probing its involvement in various controversies, including Russian interference in the 2016 election. In July 2018, he confronted Senator Mark Warner, and urged him not to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues. As of 2018, one of Schumer&#x27;s daughters worked as a marketing manager at Facebook.

===U.S. attorney firings===

As chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.

On March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign for firing eight United States Attorneys. In an interview on CBS News&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Schumer said that Gonzales &quot;doesn&#x27;t accept or doesn&#x27;t understand that he is no longer just the president&#x27;s lawyer&quot;. When Gonzales&#x27;s chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, resigned on March 13, Schumer said during a press conference that Gonzales was &quot;carrying out the political wishes of the president&quot; and declared that Sampson would &quot;not be the next Scooter Libby&quot;, meaning that he did not accept that Sampson had sole responsibility for the controversy.

Like other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties, Schumer was angered during Gonzales&#x27;s testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he did not know or could not recall details about the controversy. When Schumer&#x27;s turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had &quot;answered &#x27;I don&#x27;t know&#x27; or &#x27;I can&#x27;t recall&#x27; to close to a hundred questions&quot; about the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and did not seem to know about the inner workings of his department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give &quot;a full, complete and convincing explanation&quot; for why the eight attorneys were fired.

==Other work==
In January 2007, Schumer published a book, &quot;Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time&quot;, outlining strategies by which Democrats could court middle-class voters. One of his aides at the time, Daniel Squadron, helped write it, and they drew from Schumer&#x27;s experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.

On November 21, 2023, Schumer made his Broadway debut in a one-night performance as the Producer in &quot;Gutenberg! The Musical!&quot;.

==Personal life==
Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, were married on September 21, 1980. The ceremony took place at Windows on the World atop the north tower of the World Trade Center. Weinshall was New York City&#x27;s commissioner of transportation from 2000 to 2007. Schumer and Weinshall live in Park Slope near Grand Army Plaza.

The Schumers have two children, Jessica and Alison, both graduates of their father&#x27;s alma mater, Harvard College. Jessica served as chief of staff and general counsel of the Council of Economic Advisers from May 2013 to August 2015. Alison is a marketing manager in Facebook&#x27;s New York office. In 2018, Jessica gave birth to a son, making Schumer a grandfather.

Despite having grown up as a fan of the New York Giants, Schumer has publicly expressed support for the Buffalo Bills. After the Bills won the 2025 AFC East championship game, he said it was a &quot;great day to be a Buffalo Bills fan&quot; during remarks on the Senate floor.

==Electoral history==
==Honorary degrees==
Schumer has been awarded several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career. These include:

<text>The is a Class B river in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, about 50 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. It begins in Kashio, Totsuka-ku, Yokohama at the confluence of the Akuwa River (阿久和川) and the Hiradonagaya River (平戸永谷川) and flows for 11 kilometers to the city of Fujisawa, where it merges with the Sakai River at the confluence known as Kawana (川名). The conjoined river, which is sometimes known as the Katase River, then flows into Sagami Bay at Enoshima Island.

The catchment basin of the Kashio River is approximately 84 sq. kilometers. Because the Kashio River is a short, meandering stream, with a minimal descent, it has long been notorious for flooding. The predecessor of the Kashio River was the shallow Ōfuna Estuary (大船入江), which existed from the end of the last ice age to about 300 BC. Subsequently, earthquakes caused crustal uplift, which cut off the estuary from the bay, making it into a floodplain with the Kashio River at its center. As the river often flooded, it formed a lake that left behind a swamp as it drained. The early lake formed in the floodplain of the Kashio River is probably the lake mentioned in the Enoshima Engi, a history of the area.

<doc id="326713" wikidata="Q1045631" url="?curid=326713" title="Management by objectives">
<text>Management by objectives (MBO), also known as management by planning (MBP), was first popularized by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book &quot;The Practice of Management&quot;. Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members, then deciding how to achieve each objective in sequence. This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm, yet productive work environment. In this system of management, individual goals are synchronized with the goals of the organization.

An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee&#x27;s actual performance with the standards set. Ideally, when employees themselves have been involved with the goal-setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them, they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities.

According to George S. Odiorne, the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals, define each individual&#x27;s major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her, and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members. MBO refers to the process of setting goals for the employees so that they know what they are supposed to do at the workplace. Management by Objectives defines roles and responsibilities for the employees and help them chalk out their future course of action in the organization.

== History Of MBO ==
Peter Drucker first used the term &quot;management by objectives&quot; in his 1954 book &quot;The Practice of Management&quot;. While the basic ideas of MBO were not original to Drucker, they pulled from other management practices to create a complete &#x27;system&#x27;. The idea draws on the many ideas presented in Mary Parker Follett&#x27;s 1926 essay, &quot;The Giving of Orders&quot;.

After the term and idea were brought up, Drucker&#x27;s student, George Odiorne, continued to develop the idea in his book &quot;Management Decisions by Objectives&quot;, published in the mid-1960s. MBO was popularized by companies like Hewlett-Packard, who claimed it led to their success.

== Concept and framework ==

Management by objectives at its core is the process of employers/supervisors attempting to manage their subordinates by introducing a set of specific goals that both the employee and the company strive to achieve in the near future, and working to meet those goals accordingly.

Five steps: 
#Review organizational goal 
#Set worker objective 
#Monitor progress 
#Evaluation 
#Give reward

== Application in practice ==
There are endless ways to exercise management by objectives. One must find specific goals to aim for in an organization or business. Many noteworthy companies have used MBO. The management at the computer company Hewlett-Packard (HP) has said that it considers the policy a huge component of its success. Many other corporations praise the effectiveness of MBO, including Xerox, DuPont, Intel, and countless others. Companies that adopt MBO often report greater sales rates and productiveness within the organization. Objectives can be set in all domains of activities, such as production, marketing, services, sales, R&amp;D, human resources, finance, and information systems. Some objectives are collective, and some can be goals for each worker. Both make the task at hand seem attainable and enable the workers to visualize what needs to be done and how.

In the MBO paradigm, managers determine the enterprise&#x27;s mission and strategic goals. The goals set by top-level managers are based on an analysis of what can and should be accomplished by the organization within a specific period of time. The functions of these managers can be centralized by appointing a project manager who can monitor and control the activities of the various departments. If this cannot be done or is not desirable, each manager&#x27;s contributions to the organizational goal should be clearly spelled out.

In many large Japanese corporations, beginning in the late 1990s, MBO was used as the basis of &quot;the performance-based merit system” (seika-shugi) which used clear numerical targets to measure performance in contrast to the previous system of non-specific contracts in Japanese companies.

Objectives need quantifying and monitoring. Reliable management information systems are needed to establish relevant objectives and monitor their &quot;reach ratio&quot; in an objective way. Pay incentives (bonuses) are often linked to results in reaching the objectives.

The mnemonic S.M.A.R.T. is associated with the process of setting objectives in this paradigm. &#x27;SMART&#x27; objectives are:
* &quot;Specific&quot;: Target a specific area for improvement
* &quot;Measurable&quot;: Quantify or suggest an indicator of progress
* &quot;Assignable&quot;: Specify who will do it
* &quot;Realistic&quot;: State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources
* &quot;Time-bound&quot;: Specify when the result(s) can be achieved
The aphorism &quot;what gets measured gets done&quot; is aligned with the MBO philosophy.

==Limitations==
MBO has its detractors, notably W. Edwards Deming, who argued that a lack of understanding of systems commonly results in the misapplication of objectives. Additionally, Deming stated that setting production targets will encourage workers to meet those targets through whatever means necessary, which usually results in poor quality.

Point 7 of Deming&#x27;s key principles encourages managers to abandon objectives in favour of leadership because he felt that a leader with an understanding of systems was more likely to guide workers to an appropriate solution than the incentive of an objective. Deming also pointed out that Drucker warned managers that a systemic view was required and felt that Drucker&#x27;s warning went largely unheeded by the practitioners of MBO.

There are limitations in the underlying assumptions about the impact of management by objectives:
# It over-emphasizes the setting of goals over the working of a plan as a driver of outcomes.
# It under-emphasizes the importance of the environment or context in which the goals are set.

That context includes everything from the availability and quality of resources, to relative by leadership and stake-holders. As an example of the influence of management buy-in as a contextual influencer, in a 1991 comprehensive review of thirty years of research on the impact of Management by Objectives, Robert Rodgers and John Hunter concluded that companies whose CEOs demonstrated high commitment to MBO showed, on average, a 56% gain in productivity. Companies with CEOs who showed low commitment saw only a 6% gain in productivity.

When this approach is not properly set, agreed and managed by organizations, self-centered employees might be prone to distort results, falsely representing achievement of targets that were set in a short-term, narrow fashion. In this case, managing by objectives would be counterproductive.

The limitations mentioned above, combined with the challenges faced by modern service companies, have led to the development of methods that integrate aspects of MBO but appear to be significantly more effective in application. These include, for example, the objectives and key results (OKR) method, which was developed by John Doerr (among others) and has been used successfully in many companies, notably at Google. Agile management techniques also have a strong emphasis on goals. The group of management techniques that are based on goals, with a strong focus on engagement, team motivation and leadership, can be summarized as Management by Goals methods.

== Recent research ==
Management by Objectives is still practiced today, with a focus on planning and development aiding various organizations. The most recent research focuses on specific industries, specifying the practice of MBO for each. In addition, following criticism of the original MBO approach, a new formula was introduced in 2016, aiming at revitalizing it, that is the OPTIMAL MBO, which stands for its components, namely: (O) Objectives, Outside-in; (P) Profitability (budget) related goals; (T) Target Setting; (I) Incentives &amp; Influence; (M) Measurement; (A) Agreement, Accountability, Appraisal, Appreciation; and (L) Leadership Support.

While the practice is used today, it may go by different names – the letters &quot;MBO&quot; have lost their formality, and future planning is a more standard practice.

<text>Li Shuxian (; 4 September 1924 – 9 June 1997), was the fifth and last wife of Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing dynasty in China.

==Biography==
Li was ethnic Han Chinese and orphaned by the age of 14. After three years in foster care, her foster mother attempted to enter her into concubinage with a wealthy man. Li refused, and ran away to Beijing to become a hospital worker. In 1959, after ten years in prison, Puyi was pardoned. The pair were introduced to one another by a friend in 1962 and wed that same year. Premier Zhou Enlai approved their marriage. It was Li&#x27;s third marriage, and Puyi&#x27;s fifth. They had no children. She remained with Puyi to his last days.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Li retired from public life. She was not a regular hospital employee, but supplemented her income with a special stipend from the government that gave her a degree of financial stability.

In the early eighties, she sought and received legal ownership of royalties from Puyi&#x27;s autobiography from the government of China.

Under the approval of the government, she moved Puyi&#x27;s ashes closer to his ancestors in the Western Qing Tombs (清西陵) from the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, allowing the last Qing Emperor to rest alongside his predecessors at last. She died of lung cancer at the age of 72. It had been Puyi&#x27;s desire to be buried alongside Li as well as his first concubine Tan Yuling (潭玉齡). Li was firmly against this arrangement, stating that she had given Puyi enough of her time and energy in life.

Li&#x27;s memoirs were published posthumously under the title &quot;Modai Huangdi Puyi yu wo&quot; (). The author, Wang Qingxiang (), compiled oral interviews with Li Shuxian, along with those of others close to Puyi in his later years, to retell their marriage and family life. Li is sometimes credited as a coauthor of the book.

<text>Reginald Victor Jones (29 September 1911 – 17 December 1997) was a British physicist and scientific military intelligence expert who played an important role in the defence of Britain in by solving scientific and technical problems, and by the extensive use of deception throughout the war to confuse the Germans.

==Early life==
Reginald Jones was born in Herne Hill, South London, on 29 September 1911. He was educated at Alleyn&#x27;s School, Dulwich, and Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied Natural Sciences. In 1932 he graduated with First Class honours in physics and then, working in the Clarendon Laboratory, completed his DPhil in 1934. Subsequently, he took up a Skynner Senior Studentship in Astronomy at Balliol College, Oxford.

==Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science)==
In 1936 Jones took up the post at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, a part of the Air Ministry. Here he worked on the problems associated with defending Britain from an air attack, and later in support of the liberation of Europe from the Nazis. More generally, he was fond of practical jokes and describes in his book &quot;Most Secret War&quot; how he used that skill to deceive the Germans during World War II. His extensive use of deception to deceive the Germans is consistent with the term disinformation, which is defined as deliberate planting of false information and physical evidence to lead an opponent astray.

In September 1939, the British decided to assign a scientist to the Intelligence section of the Air Ministry. No scientist had previously worked for an intelligence service. Jones quickly rose to become Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) there. During the course of the Second World War he was closely involved with the scientific assessment of enemy technology, and the development of offensive and counter-measures technology. He solved a number of tough scientific and technical intelligence problems during World War II and is generally known today as the &quot;father of S&amp;T Intelligence&quot;.

He was briefly based at Bletchley Park in September 1939, but returned to London (Broadway) in November, leaving behind a small specialized team in Hut 3, who reported any decrypts of scientific or technological nature to &quot;ADI Science&quot;.

F. W. Winterbotham passed Jones the Oslo Report, received in 1939 from an anti-Nazi German scientist, and Jones decided that it was genuine and largely reliable, though the three service ministries regarded it as a &quot;plant&quot; and discarded their copies: &quot;... in the few dull moments of the War, I used to look up the Oslo report to see what should be coming along next.&quot;

===Radio beam guidance===
Jones&#x27;s first job was to study &quot;new German weapons&quot;, real or potential. The first of these was a radio navigation system which the Germans called &quot;Knickebein&quot;. This, as Jones soon determined, was a development of the Lorenz blind landing system and enabled an aircraft to fly along a chosen heading with useful accuracy.

At Jones&#x27;s urging, Winston Churchill ordered up an RAF search aircraft on the night of 21 June 1940, and the aircraft found the &quot;Knickebein&quot; radio signals in the frequency range which Jones had predicted. With this knowledge, the British were able to build jammers whose effect was to &quot;bend&quot; the &quot;Knickebein&quot; beams so that German bombers spent months scattering their bomb loads over the British countryside.

Thus began the &quot;Battle of the Beams&quot; which lasted throughout much of World War II, with the Germans developing new radio navigation systems and the British developing countermeasures to them. Jones frequently had to battle against entrenched interests in the armed forces, but, in addition to enjoying Churchill&#x27;s confidence, had strong support from, among others, Churchill&#x27;s scientific advisor F. A. Lindemann and the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Charles Portal.

===Fooling radar with metal foil (chaff)===
As early as 1937, Jones had suggested that a piece of metal foil falling through the air might create radar echoes. He, together with Joan Curran, was later instrumental in the deployment of &quot;Window&quot;: strips of metal foil, cut to a length appropriate to the radar&#x27;s wavelength, and dropped in bundles from aircraft, which then appeared on enemy radar screens as &quot;false bombers&quot;. This technology is now known as chaff and contrary to the popular belief, was also known to the Germans at the time. Both parties were reluctant to use it out of fear that their enemy would do the same. This delayed its deployment for almost two years.

Jones also served as a V-2 rocket expert on the Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations) and headed a German long range weapons targeting deception under the Double-Cross System.

==Postwar and awards==
In 1946 Jones was appointed to the Chair of Natural Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, which he held until his retirement in 1981. He did not want to stay in Intelligence under the proposed postwar reorganisation. During his time at Aberdeen, much of his attention was devoted to improving the sensitivity of scientific instruments such as seismometers, capacitance micrometers, microbarographs and optical levers. His book &quot;Instruments and Experiences&quot; details much of his later work in some depth and can act as a reference work on fine mechanism design.

Jones was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1942, for the planning of a raid on Bruneval to capture German radar equipment (Churchill had proposed that Jones should be appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) but the head of the Civil Service Sir Horace Wilson &quot;threatened to resign&quot; as Jones was only a lowly Scientific Officer, and the CBE was a compromise.) He was subsequently appointed CB in 1946; and Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1994 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1965, and received an honorary DSc from the University of Aberdeen in 1996. In 1969 he delivered the Wilkins Lecture.

Jones was principal interviewee of the BBC One TV documentary series &quot;The Secret War&quot;, first aired on 5 January 1977 and narrated by William Woollard. 

His 1978 published autobiography &quot;Most Secret War: British Scientific Intelligence 1939–1945&quot; was described by historian A. J. P. Taylor as &quot;the most fascinating book on the Second World War that I have ever read&quot; and, more generally, it has acquired almost classic status.

In 1981, Jones became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. The same year he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on &quot;From Magna Carta to Microchip&quot;.

In 1993 he was the first recipient of the R. V. Jones Intelligence Award, which the CIA created in his honour.

== Quotes ==
Jones published a book in 1989 entitled &quot;Reflections on Intelligence&quot;. In this book, he mused: &quot;I for one would have little objection to any authority having any information it wished about my actions - or even my thoughts - provided that I could be sure that it would not misinterpret the information to come to false conclusions about me.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jones married Vera Cain in 1940; they had two daughters and a son. 

He died on 17 December 1997. He is buried in Corgarff Cemetery, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire. His papers are held by Churchill College, Cambridge.

<text>Ray Garrett Jr. (August 11, 1920 – February 3, 1980 in Chicago, Illinois) was a senior partner at Gardner Carton &amp; Douglas in Chicago until his appointment as the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under President Richard Nixon in 1973, where he served for two years.

==Biography==
Garrett, a Yale College graduate, received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1949. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II as a captain in the artillery, where he saw action at the Battle of the Bulge, was in the first American artillery battalion across the Rhine, and earned a bronze star. His father, Ray Garrett, Sr., fought during World War I.

He first joined the SEC in 1954 and served as Director of Corporate Regulation before returning to Chicago at Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas in 1958 as a partner. Garrett&#x27;s predecessor as Chairman of the SEC, G. Bradford Cook, had resigned in disgrace, and Garrett helped re-establish trust in the SEC.Ray Garrett also participated in revising Parts VII through XI of the American Law Institute&#x27;s Federal Securities Code which was published the year he died, and was a frequent contributor to journals in his field.

Garrett spearheaded tough legislation, making his commission one of the strongest in recent history. One of these changes was the demise of fixed commissions on stock transactions, which met with mixed results. 

Ray Garrett also participated in revising Parts VII through XI of the American Law Institute&#x27;s Federal Securities Code which was published the year he died, and was a frequent contributor to journals in his field.

The Ray Garrett Jr. Corporate and Securities Institute at Northwestern University was established in memory of Garrett. See: http://www.law.northwestern.edu/garrett/] at Northwestern University was established in memory of Garrett.</text><links>

<doc id="326752" wikidata="Q8074653" url="?curid=326752" title="Zounds">
<text>Zounds are an English anarcho punk/post-punk band from Reading, Berkshire, formed in 1977. Originally they were part of the cassette culture movement, releasing material on the Fuck Off Records label, and were also involved in the squatting and free festival scene. The name of the band is derived from the old English minced oath &quot;&quot;, a contraction of &quot;God&#x27;s wounds&quot;, referring to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ, formerly used as a mildly blasphemous oath.

==History==
The band were formed around the nucleus of Steve Lake from Reading, Berkshire and evolved from a number of jamming sessions with other musicians and friends in Oxford, taking in influences from the Velvet Underground to the Sex Pistols. The band began performing gigs in 1977/78 with a line-up of Steve Lake (vocals/bass), Steve Burch (guitar) and Jimmy Lacey (drums), adding Nick Godwin (guitar) at their second gig – adopting the name &#x27;Zounds&#x27;, chosen from a dictionary by Burch. Soon, Burch left the group and was replaced by Laurence Wood. After this the band slowly became more politicized owing to troubles with police and unfolding events of the Cold War, and became more and more involved with free festivals, alongside The Mob, with whom they developed a close association.
The band met up with fellow anarchists Crass when, legend has it, their van broke down on the road. They made their way to nearby Dial House, where Crass were based, who helped them with repairs. The two bands became friends, and although musically very divergent, they shared many common political views. After undergoing several line-up changes Zounds shortly afterwards released their first EP, &quot;Can&#x27;t Cheat Karma&quot;, on the Crass Records label (although drummer Josef was replaced for the recording by a session drummer) in 1980. The EP featured possibly their most well-known track &quot;Subvert&quot;, a call to arms against the grind of daily life. The release of this EP and association with Crass led to an increase in the band&#x27;s profile in the embryonic anarcho-punk scene, touring with both Crass and the Poison Girls, as well as performing several squat gigs in West Berlin.

The band released their first album &quot;The Curse of Zounds&quot; on Rough Trade Records in 1981, recording and mixing the LP within five days. The cover art, by anarchist artist Clifford Harper, featured a painting of fire fighters apparently trying to put out a blaze at the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, the picture continued onto the back cover, which showed that in fact they are spraying the fire with petrol, thus feeding it. The band released three more singles on Rough Trade, &quot;Demystification&quot; (a psychedelia-influenced track backed with &quot;Great White Hunter&quot;), &quot;Dancing&quot; and &quot;More Trouble Coming Every Day&quot;, as well &quot;Le Vache Qui Rit&quot; (initially intended for a split EP with The Mob for an anti-draft benefit in Belgium).

The band split up in late 1982, Steve Lake disaffected with the anarchist music scene in general and the band worn out from touring. Bass player and vocalist Steve Lake and guitarist Laurence Wood continued to work together for a while as The World Service with original Zounds member Nick Godwin, whilst drummer Josef Porter joined The Mob and later Blyth Power. Lake continued work as a solo artist recording two albums with Nick Godwin and Brian Pugsley. Zounds occasionally reform for benefit gigs with a line-up augmented by Protag (formerly of Instant Automatons, Alternative TV and Blyth Power) and drummer Stick (previously of Dirt, Doom and Extreme Noise Terror). A remixed version of the band&#x27;s song &quot;This Land&quot; was released in 2001 as a CD single benefit for the McLibel support campaign. In 2005 the &quot;Go All The Way &quot; EP was released with tracks from an aborted second album, with tracks commenting on the USA&#x27;s War on Terror.

In 2007 Zounds reformed. Steve Lake recruited Paul O&#x27;Donnell (bass) and Paul Gilbert (drums) from The Evil Presleys, a &quot;primal rock n roll&quot; band that they were in together (with guitarist Andy Parker). The reformed Zounds then played sporadic gigs over the next two years including &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London and the Carling Academy, Birmingham (both with guitarist Dominic Dominion).

In 2010 the band began playing more extensively across the UK and Europe, completing two short European tours. The first was for a week in April (the Netherlands and Belgium) and the second was from 17 September to 3 October mainly in Germany, plus gigs in the Netherlands, Poland and Italy.

In 2011, they completed a new album, &quot;The Redemption of Zounds&quot;, which was available for download from 10 July, on CD from 26 July on Overground Records and on vinyl in the US on Brokenrekids from September that year.

<doc id="326762" wikidata="Q719934" url="?curid=326762" title="Inline linking">
<text>Inline linking (also known as hotlinking, piggy-backing, direct linking, offsite image grabs, bandwidth theft, or leeching) is the practice of using or embedding a linked object—often an image—from one website onto a webpage of another website. In this process, the second site does not host the object itself but instead loads it directly from the original source, creating an inline link to the hosting site.

==HTTP and inline linking==
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the technology behind the World Wide Web, does not differentiate between different types of links—all links are functionally equal. As a result, resources can be linked from any server and loaded onto a web page regardless of their original location.

When a website is visited, the browser first downloads the HTML document containing the web page&#x27;s textual content. This document may reference additional resources, including other HTML files, images, scripts, or stylesheet. Within the HTML, codice_1 tags specify the URLs of images to be displayed on the page. If the codice_1 tag does not specify a server, the web browser assumes that the image is hosted on the same server as the parent page (e.g., codice_3). If the codice_1 tag contains an absolute URL, the browser retrieves the image from an external server (e.g., codice_5).

When a browser downloads an HTML page containing such an image, the browser will contact the remote server to request the image content.

==Common uses==
The ability to display content from one site within another is part of the original design of the Web&#x27;s hypertext medium. Common uses include:

* It is copyright infringement to make copies of a work for which the person making copies has no license, but there is no infringement when the re-user provides a simple text link within an HTML document that points to the location of the original image or file (simply called a &quot;link&quot;).
* Web architects may deliberately segregate the images of a site on one server or a group of servers. Hosting images on separate servers allows the site to divide the bandwidth requirements between servers. As an example, the high-volume site Slashdot stores its &quot;front page&quot; at codice_6, individual stories on servers such as codice_7 or codice_8, and serves images for each host from codice_9.
* An article on one site may choose to refer to copyrighted images or content on another site via inline linking, which may avoid rights and ownership issues that copying the original files could raise. However, this practice is generally discouraged due to resulting bandwidth loading of the source, and the source provider is often offended because the viewer is not seeing the whole original page, which provides the intended context of the image.
* Many web pages include banner ads. Banner ads are images hosted by a company that acts as middleman between the advertisers and the websites on which the ads appear. The codice_1 tag may specify a URL to a CGI script on the ad server, including a string uniquely identifying the site producing the traffic, and possibly other information about the person viewing the ad, previously collected and associated with a cookie. The CGI script determines which image to send in response to the request.
* Some websites hotlink from a faster server to increase client loading speed.
* Hit counters or Web counters show how many times a page has been loaded. Several companies provide hit counters that are maintained off site and displayed with an inline link.

==Controversial uses==
The blurring of boundaries between sites can lead to other problems when the site violates users&#x27; expectations. Other times, inline linking can be done for malicious purposes.

* Content sites where the object is stored and from which it is retrieved may not like the new placement.
* Inline linking to an image stored on another site increases the bandwidth use of that site even though the site is not being viewed as intended. The complaint may be the loss of ad revenue or changing the perceived meaning through an unapproved context.
* Cross-site scripting and phishing attacks may include inline links to a legitimate site to gain the confidence of a victim.
* Pay-per-content services may attempt to restrict access to their content through complex scripting and inline linking techniques.
* Inline objects can be used to perform drive-by attacks on the client, exploiting faults in the code that interprets the objects. When an object is stored on an external server, the referring site has no control over if and when an originally beneficial object&#x27;s content is replaced by malicious content.
* The requests for inline objects usually contain the referrer information. This leaks information about the browsed pages to the servers hosting the objects (see web visitor tracking).

== Prevention ==

=== Client side ===

Most web browsers will blindly follow the URL for inline links, even though it is a frequent security complaint. Embedded images may be used as a web bug to track users or to relay information to a third party. Many ad filtering browser tools will restrict this behavior to varying degrees.

=== Server side ===

Some servers are programmed to use the HTTP referer header to detect hotlinking and return a condemnatory message, commonly in the same format, in place of the expected image or media clip. Most servers can be configured to partially protect hosted media from inline linking, usually by not serving the media or by serving a different file.

URL rewriting is often used (e.g., mod_rewrite with Apache HTTP Server) to reject or redirect attempted hotlinks to images and media to an alternative resource. Most types of electronic media can be redirected this way, including video files, music files, and animations (such as Flash).

Other solutions usually combine URL rewriting with some custom complex server side scripting to allow hotlinking for a short time, or in more complex setups, to allow the hotlinking but return an alternative image with reduced quality and size and thus reduce the bandwidth load when requested from a remote server. All hotlink prevention measures risk deteriorating the user experience on the third-party website.

==Copyright issues raised by inline linking==
The most significant legal fact about inline linking, relative to copyright law considerations, is that the inline linker does not place a copy of the image file on its own Internet server. Rather, the inline linker places a pointer on its Internet server that points to the server on which the proprietor of the image has placed the image file. This pointer causes a user&#x27;s browser to jump to the proprietor&#x27;s server and fetch the image file to the user&#x27;s computer. US courts have considered this a decisive fact in copyright analysis. Thus, in &quot;Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit explained why inline linking did not violate US copyright law:

Google does not...display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user&#x27;s computer screen. Because Google&#x27;s computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any &quot;material objects...in which a work is fixed...and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated&quot; and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user&#x27;s browser to a website publisher&#x27;s computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user&#x27;s computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user&#x27;s browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user&#x27;s computer screen. Google may facilitate the user&#x27;s access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner&#x27;s display rights. ...While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act...does not protect a copyright holder against [such] acts...

<text>Joaquín José Lavín Infante (born 23 October 1953) is a Chilean politician of the Independent Democratic Union (UDI) party and former mayor of Las Condes, in the northeastern zone of Santiago. Formerly Lavín has also been mayor of Santiago, Minister of Education and Minister of Social Development. He ran for president twice in 1999 and 2005, losing both times. In 2021 he tried to run again, but this time he was defeated in a primary election by Sebastián Sichel. Besides his political involvement Lavín has been active in education in the University for Development, of which he was one of the founders and original owners, and as editor of the economics section in &quot;El Mercurio&quot;.

His wife, son and daughter-in-law have also been elected politicians.

==Early life and career==
Lavin was born on 23 October 1953 in Santiago to Joaquín Lavín Pradenas and Carmen Infante Vial. Lavin&#x27;s father is believed to have owned over 500 hectares of land. Lavin studied economics at the University of Chicago, where he studied under Milton Friedman, one of many &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; to influence Chilean politics. 

Lavin is married to María Estela León Ruíz, and the couple have 7 children, including federal deputy Joaquín Lavín León.

==Career==
Lavín was present in the Acto de Chacarillas in 1977, a ritualized pro-Pinochet act reminiscent of Francoist Spain.

In the period of 1979–1981 at the age of 26 he was appointed as a Dean of Economic Department at Concepción University. From 1981 until 1986 Lavin was a desk-editor of &quot;Economics and Business&quot; in the newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot;. In 1990 he founded with other partners the private Universidad del Desarrollo.

His professional life was always connected with politics and the first step toward this was done when he became a mayor of Las Condes in 1992.

He wrote a book, &quot;Una revolución silenciosa&quot; (&quot;A Quiet Revolution&quot;), in support of General Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s economic policies. Afterwards, in 1992, Lavín was elected mayor of Las Condes, a stronghold of the right, with 31% of the vote and reelected in 1997 with 78% of the vote.

Lavín was the presidential candidate for the UDI-National Renewal coalition Alliance for Chile in the 1999 election. He eventually lost to PS/PPD candidate Ricardo Lagos in a runoff by 200,000 votes. Lavín again represented UDI in the 2005 presidential election, but ended in third place with 23.23% of the vote, due to the presence of another right-wing candidate in the race, Sebastián Piñera, who made it to the runoff election with 25.41% of the vote.

Lavín was narrowly defeated in his bid for a Senate seat in the general election held in December 2009, but on 10 February 2010, President-elect Sebastián Piñera named him Secretary of Education.

In July 2011, President Piñera replaced Lavín as Minister of Education by Felipe Bulnes as a response to the months of student protest and appointed him as Minister of Social Development (2011-2013).

In 2016 he was elected mayor of Las Condes again getting 78% of the vote.

He is now Dean of the Business School of the Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD).

Lavín is a devout Roman Catholic and also a member of the Prealature of Opus Dei.

On 16 July 2017, Lavín garnered controversy after he hung a rainbow flag over the town hall. This prompted criticism from former presidential candidate José Antonio Kast, himself a former UDI member, who said that there was a &quot;gay dictatorship&quot; in Chile that &quot;corners certain politicians who do not have the courage to say things as they believe them&quot;. Lavín had also refused to allow the anti-transgender Bus of Freedom, a bus created by the CitizenGo initiative HazteOir, to pass through Las Condes. Lavín had claimed that his refusal to allow the bus to pass through was related to a timing issue. On 20 July, he had expressed openness to same-sex adoption.

During his campaigning to run for the Chilean presidency a noticeable effort was made by his parti UDI to put him at the forefront of all public television channels. He was frequently invited as a guest in morning shows, where he talked about politics and also did some more casual and relaxed appearances. The public nevertheless noticed that he was constantly invited to these TV shows as means of political strategy to make people feel that he is a relatable figure. Due to the constant mocking and comments in social media about the exacerbated appearances he gradually stopped appearing on TV.

<doc id="326771" wikidata="Q1061289" url="?curid=326771" title="King Wu of Zhou">
<text>King Wu of Zhou (; died ), personal name Ji Fa, was the founding king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty. The chronology of his reign is disputed but is generally thought to have begun around 1046 BCE and ended with his death three years later.

King Wu was the second son of Ji Chang (posthumously King Wen) and Tai Si. In most accounts, his older brother Bo Yikao was said to have predeceased his father, typically at the hands of King Zhou of Shang, the last king of the Shang dynasty; in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, however, it is assumed that his inheritance represented an older tradition among the Zhou of passing over the eldest son. (Fa&#x27;s grandfather Jili had likewise inherited Zhou despite two older brothers.)

Upon his succession, Fa worked with his father-in-law Jiang Ziya to accomplish an unfinished task: overthrowing the Shang dynasty. During the ninth year of his reign, Fa marched down the Yellow River to the Mengjin ford and met with more than 800 dukes. He constructed an ancestral tablet with his father&#x27;s posthumous name as King Wen and placed it on a chariot in the middle of the host; considering the timing unpropitious, though, he did not yet attack Shang. In 1046 BC, King Wu took advantage of Shang disunity to launch an attack along with many neighboring dukes. The Battle of Muye destroyed Shang&#x27;s forces and King Zhou of Shang set his palace on fire, dying within.

King Wu followed his victory by establishing many feudal states under his 16 younger brothers and clans allied by marriage, but his death three years later provoked several rebellions against his young heir King Cheng and the regent Ji Dan, even from three of his brothers.

A burial mound in Zhouling town, Xianyang, Shaanxi was once thought to be King Wu&#x27;s tomb. It was fitted with a headstone bearing Wu&#x27;s name in the Qing dynasty. Modern archeology has since concluded that the tomb is not old enough to be from the Zhou dynasty, and is more likely to be that of a Han dynasty royal. The true location of King Wu&#x27;s tomb remains unknown, but is likely to be in the Xianyang-Xi&#x27;an area.

King Wu is considered one of the great heroes of China, together with the mythical Yellow Emperor and the legendary Yu the Great.

<doc id="326775" wikidata="Q487696" url="?curid=326775" title="Northern Bavarian">
<text>Northern Bavarian is a dialect of Bavarian, together with Central Bavarian and Southern Bavarian. Bavarian is mostly spoken in the Upper Palatinate, although not in Regensburg, which is a primarily Central Bavarian–speaking area, according to a linguistic survey done in the late 1980s. According to the same survey, Northern Bavarian is also spoken in Upper Franconia, as well as in some areas in Upper and Lower Bavaria, such as in the areas around Eichstätt and Kelheim. Few speakers remained in the Czech Republic, mostly concentrated around Aš and Železná Ruda, at the time of the survey, but considering the time which has passed since the survey, the dialect may be extinct in those places today. If it still exists there, it would include the &quot;ostegerländische Dialektgruppe&quot;. Ethnologue estimates that there were 9,000 speakers of Bavarian in the Czech Republic in 2005, but does not clarify if these were Northern Bavarian speakers.

According to the same linguistic survey, the dialect is flourishing in the areas where it is spoken, despite the fact that most speakers actively use Standard German. In the south of the area where Northern Bavarian is spoken, Central Bavarian is said to have higher prestige, and Northern Bavarian characteristics are therefore not as visible as in the north, where speakers even tend to use a heavy Northern Bavarian accent when speaking German.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Northern Bavarian has 8 vowels:

And 11 diphthongs:

Before , are rounded to .

In southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the diphthongs are realized with an opener offset, i.e. .

An interesting aspect of the diphthongs are the so-called &quot;reversed diphthongs&quot;, or in German, &quot;gestürzte Diphthonge&quot;. They are called so because the Middle High German diphthongs became ( became after unrounding) in Northern Bavarian, while they generally became in Standard German. Compare Standard German &quot;Brief&quot; , &quot;Bruder&quot; , &quot;Brüder&quot; and Northern Bavarian , , .

The Northern Bavarian diphthong corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German . Compare Standard German &quot;Schaf&quot; , &quot;Stroh&quot; and Northern Bavarian , . Likewise, the Northern Bavarian diphthong corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German and by unrounding to . Compare Standard German &quot;Schnee&quot; , &quot;böse&quot; with Northern Bavarian , .

In many Northern Bavarian variants, nasalization is increasingly common.

=== Consonants ===
Northern Bavarian has about 33 consonants:

 is realized as either or when occurring postvocally.

 may be syllabic, as in Northern Bavarian ; compare Standard German &quot;Mühle&quot;.

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===

==== Gender ====
All nouns in Northern Bavarian have one of three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter. Many nouns have the same gender as in Standard German, but there are many exceptions. An example is &quot;Benzin&quot;, which is neuter in Standard German, but masculine in Northern Bavarian. Another example is &quot;Butter&quot;, which is feminine in Standard German, but it can be all three genders in Northern Bavarian depending on your location and local variation of the dialect.

==== Case ====
As in Standard German there are four cases in Northern Bavarian: nominative, accusative, genitive and dative. The genitive case, however, is uncommon and is commonly replaced either with the dative and a possessive pronoun or with the preposition &quot;von&quot; and the dative, e.g. , or &quot;father&#x27;s house&quot;. An exception is the genitive instead of the dative after the singular possessive pronouns, e.g. , which is as correct as &quot;behind me&quot;. Prepositions take the dative or the accusative, but not the genitive, e.g. (formally ) &quot;despite the rain&quot;. The dative ending -m often sounds like the accusative ending -n (see the previous example), so that these two cases are not distinguishable.

==== Inflection ====
Nouns in Northern Bavarian are inflected for number, and to a lesser extent, case. Inflecting for number is common across all three genders, and especially umlaut is productive, in particular in masculine nouns. The most common plural marker in feminine nouns is , while it is with most neuter nouns. Many nouns, across the genders, are the same in the plural as in the singular.

:English &quot;head&quot;, Standard German &quot;Kopf&quot;, Northern Bavarian sg. m. &gt; pl. 
:English &quot;cat&quot;, Standard German &quot;Katze&quot;, Northern Bavarian sg. f. &gt; pl. 
:English &quot;house&quot;, Standard German &quot;Haus&quot;, Northern Bavarian sg. n. &gt; pl. 

Weak masculine nouns are inflected in the accusative and dative case, most commonly with suffixation of a nasal consonant, such as or , while the other cases remain uninflected. Many weak feminine nouns have the ending in most cases, though not to be confused with the plural ending. Weak neuter nouns have almost been lost, with only strong remaining, and therefore inflection for case is basically nonexistent.

:English &quot;boy&quot;, Standard German &quot;Bube&quot;, Northern Bavarian m. nom. &gt; m. acc./dat. 

=== Adjectives ===
The inflection of adjectives in Northern Bavarian differ depending on whether the adjective is preceded by a definite article or a demonstrative, or if it is preceded by an indefinite article or a possessive, or if it is used as a predicate, of which the latter is only present in some varieties. Adjectives without any determiner rarely occur.

Below can the inflectional paradigms be seen, with the adjective serving as an example. This is also the form used in all situations, when the adjective is used as a predicate, and therefore no paradigm is needed. Compare Northern Bavarian with the Standard German &quot;alt&quot;, in English &quot;old&quot;.

The predicate form of an adjective differ from the other forms, not only because it is the basic form, but also because it has a long vowel, unlike the other forms, as in above. Other examples include and , which become and , respectively. Compare with the Standard German &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;breit&quot;, in English &quot;big&quot; and &quot;broad&quot;.

Comparative adjectives are formed by suffixing , and superlative adjectives are formed by suffixing . Vowel changes often take place when the suffixation happens. An example is , which becomes when comparative and when superlative. Compare with the Standard German &quot;hoch&quot;, &quot;höher&quot; and &quot;höchsten&quot;, in English &quot;high&quot;, &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;highest&quot;.

=== Pronouns ===
The pronouns of Northern Bavarian differ slightly from variety to variety. Furthermore, there are two pairs of pronouns, one used when in stressed position and the other used when unstressed.



There is no gender distinction in the plural.

The ending in the stressed first person singular nominative and -accusative and in stressed the second person singular accusative is only present in northern- and western varieties of Northern Bavarian.

At the time of a linguistic survey carried out in the late 1980s, pronouns also existed for unstressed first person plural accusative and unstressed second person plural accusative, and , respectively, but they have probably fallen out of usage today.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Northern Bavarian are conjugated for person, tense and mood. The Northern Bavarian verbs are also subject to both vowel change and apophony.

==== Non-finite forms ====
The non-finite forms have one three endings: , and . The first ending is rare, and is only present in some few monosyllabic verbs, such as , Standard German &quot;sein&quot;, English &quot;to be&quot;; , Standard German &quot;gehen&quot;, English &quot;to go&quot;; , Standard German &quot;stehen&quot;, English &quot;to stand&quot;; and , Standard German &quot;tun&quot;, English &quot;to do&quot;. The second ending is the most common ending found on most verbs, such as , Standard German &quot;bitten&quot;, English &quot;to ask&quot;. The third ending is used with verbs having a certain stem-final consonant, such as , Standard German &quot;singen&quot;, English &quot;to sing&quot;.

==== Present tense ====
The personal endings for the present tense differ slightly from variety to variety, but are largely uniform. The endings in the scheme below are attached to the stem, and not the non-finite form. The stem is found by removing the non-finite ending, if it is or .

As can be seen in the scheme above, the first person singular is basically the same as the stem, and the first- and third persons plural are the same as the non-finite form. Furthermore, the third person singular is realized as - when occurring before a fortis obstruent, and that in some southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the first person plural has the ending -, and therefore isn&#x27;t the non-finite form.

The singular imperative is the same as the first person singular, and the plural imperative is the same as the second person plural. Only one exception exists, which is the imperative of , Standard German &quot;sein&quot;, English &quot;to be&quot;, which is .

==== Past tense ====
Only one verb with a distinct simple past tense form remains, , Standard German &quot;sein&quot;, English &quot;to be&quot;, with the simple past tense form , Standard German &quot;war&quot;, English &quot;was&quot;. The past tense of other verbs is formed in the same way as Standard German uses &quot;haben&quot; or &quot;sein&quot;, English &quot;to have&quot; and &quot;to be&quot;, respectively, and the past participle.

The past participle in Northern Bavarian is formed by the prefix -, although not on verbs beginning with a plosive consonant, where the prefix is left out. Thus we see , Standard German &quot;geschüttet&quot;, English &quot;shaken&quot;; , Standard German &quot;genommen&quot;, English &quot;taken&quot;; , Standard German &quot;gebracht&quot;, English &quot;brought&quot;; and , Standard German &quot;getragen&quot;, English &quot;carried&quot;.

The verbs and , Standard German &quot;haben&quot; and &quot;sein&quot;, English &quot;to have&quot; and &quot;to be&quot;, can be seen conjugated in the scheme below in the present, as they are irregular. They have the past participles, and , respectively. Compare with Standard German &quot;gehaben&quot; and &quot;gewesen&quot;, English &quot;had&quot; and &quot;been&quot;.

Examples can be seen below:
* , Standard German &quot;Ich habe geschüttet&quot;, English &quot;I have poured&quot;
* , Standard German &quot;Er hat gebracht&quot;, English &quot;He has brought&quot;

==== Subjunctive ====
It is quite straightforward to form the subjunctive in Northern Bavarian. The subjunctive of verbs is formed with the suffix -, as in &gt; , Standard German &quot;wissen&quot; &gt; &quot;wüßte&quot;, English &quot;to know&quot; &gt; &quot;I would know&quot;.

==== Apophony ====
Both weak verbs and strong verbs may undergo apophony. The strong verbs can be split into two groups: the first group where the vowel in the non-finite form is the same as in the past participle; and the second group where the vowel in the non-finite form is different from the vowel in the past participle. The most common vowel gradations in the second group can be seen below:

* &gt; : &gt; , Standard German &quot;schneiden&quot; &gt; &quot;geschnitten&quot; - English &quot;to cut&quot;
* &gt; , : &gt; , Standard German &quot;bieten&quot; &gt; &quot;geboten&quot; - English &quot;to offer&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; , Standard German &quot;singen&quot; &gt; &quot;gesungen&quot; - English &quot;to sing&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; , Standard German &quot;dreschen&quot; &gt; &quot;gedroschen&quot; - English &quot;to thresh&quot;

Apophony is not as common with weak verbs as in Standard German. However, the number of weak verbs with morphophonological variations is high, especially change in vowel length is common.

<doc id="326776" wikidata="Q1641122" url="?curid=326776" title="Online service provider">
<text>An online service provider (OSP) can, for example, be an Internet service provider, an email provider, a news provider (press), an entertainment provider (music, movies), a search engine, an e-commerce site, an online banking site, a health site, an official government site, social media, a wiki, or a Usenet newsgroup. 

In its original more limited definition, it referred only to a commercial computer communication service in which paid members could dial via a computer modem the service&#x27;s private computer network and access various services and information resources such as bulletin board systems, downloadable files and programs, news articles, chat rooms, and electronic mail services. The term &quot;online service&quot; was also used in references to these dial-up services. The traditional dial-up online service differed from the modern Internet service provider in that they provided a large degree of content that was only accessible by those who subscribed to the online service, while ISP mostly serves to provide access to the Internet and generally provides little if any exclusive content of its own. 

In the U.S., the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) portion of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has expanded the legal definition of online service in two different ways for different portions of the law. It states in section 512(k)(1):

(A) As used in subsection (a), the term &quot;service provider&quot; means an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user&#x27;s choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.&lt;br&gt;
(B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term &quot;service provider&quot; means a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefore, and includes an entity described in subparagraph (A).

These broad definitions make it possible for numerous web businesses to benefit from the OCILLA.

==History==
The first commercial online services went live in 1979. CompuServe (owned in the 1980s and 1990s by H&amp;R Block) and The Source (for a time owned by The Reader&#x27;s Digest) are considered the first major online services created to serve the market of personal computer users. Utilizing text-based interfaces and menus, these services allowed anyone with a modem and communications software to use email, chat, news, financial and stock information, bulletin boards, special interest groups (SIGs), forums and general information. Subscribers could exchange email only with other subscribers of the same service. (For a time a service called DASnet carried mail among several online services, and CompuServe, MCI Mail, and other services experimented with X.400 protocols to exchange email until the Internet rendered these outmoded.)

Other text-based online services followed such as Delphi, GEnie and MCI Mail. The 1980s also saw the rise of independent Computer Bulletin Boards, or BBSes. (Online services are not BBSes. An online service may contain an electronic bulletin board, but the term &quot;BBS&quot; is reserved for independent dialup, microcomputer-based services that are usually single-user systems.)

The commercial services used pre-existing packet-switched (X.25) data communications networks, or the services&#x27; own networks (as with CompuServe). In either case, users dialed into local access points and were connected to remote computer centers where information and services were located. As with telephone service, subscribers paid by the minute, with separate day-time and evening/weekend rates.

As the use of computers that supported color and graphics, such the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, Apple II, and early IBM PC compatibles, increased, online services gradually developed framed or partially graphical information displays. Early services such as CompuServe added increasingly sophisticated graphics-based front end software to present their information, though they continued to offer text-based access for those who needed or preferred it. In 1985 Viewtron, which began as a Videotex service requiring a dedicated terminal, introduced software allowing home computer owners access. Beginning in the mid-1980s graphics based online services such as PlayNET, Prodigy, and Quantum Link (aka Q-Link) were developed. Quantum Link, which was based on Commodore-only Playnet software, later developed AppleLink Personal Edition, PC-Link (based on Tandy&#x27;s DeskMate), and Promenade (for IBM), all of which (including Q-Link) were later combined as America Online.

These online services presaged the web browser that would change global online life 10 years later. Before Quantum Link, Apple computer had developed its own service, called AppleLink, which was mostly a support network targeted at Apple dealers and developers. Later, Apple offered the short-lived eWorld, targeted at Mac consumers and based on the Mac version of the America Online software.

Beginning in 1992, the Internet, which had previously been limited to government, academic, and corporate research settings, was opened to commercial entities. The first online service to offer Internet access was DELPHI, which had developed TCP/IP access much earlier, in connection with an environmental group that rated Internet access.

The explosion of popularity of the World Wide Web in 1994 accelerated the development of the Internet as an information and communication resource for consumers and businesses. The sudden availability of low- to no-cost email and appearance of free independent web sites broke the business model that had supported the rise of the early online service industry.

CompuServe, BIX, AOL, DELPHI, and Prodigy gradually added access to Internet e-mail, Usenet newsgroups, ftp, and to web sites. At the same time, they moved from usage-based billing to monthly subscriptions. Similarly, companies that paid to have AOL host their information or early online stores began to develop their own web sites, putting further stress on the economics of the online industry. Only the largest services like AOL (which later acquired CompuServe, just as CompuServe acquired The Source) were able to make the transition to the Internet-centric world.

A new class of online service provider arose to provide access to the Internet, the internet service provider or ISP. Internet-only service providers like UUNET, The Pipeline, Panix, Netcom, the World, EarthLink, and MindSpring provided no content of their own, concentrating their efforts on making it easy for nontechnical users to install the various software required to &quot;get online&quot; before consumer operating systems came internet-enabled out of the box. In contrast to the online services&#x27; multitiered per-minute or per-hour rates, many ISPs offered flat-fee, unlimited access plans. Independent companies sprang up to offer access and packages to compete with the big networks (eg, the-wire.com, 1994 in Toronto and bway.net 1995 in New York). These providers first offered access through telephone and modem, just as did the early online services providers. By the early 2000s, these independent ISPs had largely been supplanted by high speed and broadband access through cable and phone companies, as well as wireless access.

The importance of the online services industry was vital in &quot;paving the road&quot; for the information superhighway. When Mosaic and Netscape were released in 1994, they had a ready audience of more than 10 million people who were able to download their first web browser through an online service. Though ISPs quickly began offering software packages with setup to their customers, this brief period gave many users their first online experience.

Two online services in particular, Prodigy and AOL, are often confused with the Internet, or the origins of the Internet. Prodigy&#x27;s Chief Technical Officer said in 1999: &quot;Eleven years ago, the Internet was just an intangible dream that Prodigy brought to life. Now it is a force to be reckoned with.&quot; Despite that statement, neither service provided the back bone for the Internet, nor did either start the Internet.

==Online service interfaces==
The first online service used a simple text-based interface in which content was largely text only and users made choices via a command prompt. This allowed just about any computer with a modem and terminal communications program the ability to access these text-based online services. CompuServe would later offer, with the advent of the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows-based PCs, a GUI interface program for their service. This provided a very rudimentary GUI interface. CompuServe continued to offer text-only access for those needing it. Online services like Prodigy and AOL developed their online service around a GUI and thus unlike CompuServe&#x27;s early GUI-based software, these online services provided a more robust GUI interface. Early GUI-based online service interfaces offered little in the way of detailed graphics such as photographs or pictures. Largely they were limited to simple icons and buttons and text. As modem speed increased it became more feasible to offer images and other more complicated graphics to users thus providing a nicer look to their services

==Common resources provided by online services==
Some of the resources and services online services have provided access to include message boards, chat services, electronic mail, file archives, current news and weather, online encyclopedias, airline reservations, and online games. Major online service providers like Compuserve also served as a way for software and hardware manufacturers to provide online support for their products via forums and file download areas within the online service provider&#x27;s network. Prior to the advent of the web, such support had to be done either via an online service or a private bulletin board system run by the company and accessed over a direct phone line.

==Responsibility==
Depending on the jurisdiction there may be rules exempting an OSP from responsibility for content provided by users, but with a &quot;&#x27; notice and take down&quot; (NTD) obligation to remove unacceptable content as soon as it is noticed.

<doc id="326777" wikidata="Q474709" url="?curid=326777" title="Amphibious aircraft">
<text>An amphibious aircraft, or amphibian, is an aircraft that can take off and land on both solid ground and water. These aircraft are typically fixed-wing, though amphibious helicopters do exist as well. Fixed-wing amphibious aircraft are seaplanes (flying boats and floatplanes) which are equipped with retractable wheels, at the expense of extra weight and complexity, plus diminished range and fuel economy compared with planes designed specifically for land-only or water-only operation. 

==Design==
Floatplanes often have floats that are interchangeable with wheeled landing gear (thereby producing a conventional land-based aircraft). However, in cases where this is not practical, amphibious floatplanes, such as the amphibious version of the DHC Otter, incorporate retractable wheels within their floats. Some amphibians are fitted with reinforced keels which act as skis, allowing them to land on snow or ice with their wheels up.

Many amphibian aircraft are of the flying boat type. These aircraft, and those designed as floatplanes with a single main float under the fuselage centerline (such as the Loening OL and Grumman J2F), require outrigger floats to provide lateral stability so as to avoid dipping a wingtip, which can destroy an aircraft if it happens at speed, or can cause the wingtip to fill with water and sink if stationary. While these impose weight and drag, amphibious aircraft also face the possibility of these getting hit when operating from a runway. A common solution is to make them retractable, like those found on the Consolidated Catalina; however, these are even heavier than fixed floats. Some aircraft may have the tip floats removed for extended use from land. Other amphibians, such as the Dornier Seastar, use stub wings, called sponsons, mounted with their own lower surfaces nearly even with the ventral &quot;boat-hull&quot;-shaped fuselage surface. This can provide the needed stability, while floatplane amphibians usually avoid the problem by dividing their buoyancy requirements between two floats, much like a catamaran.

Some non-amphibious seaplanes may be mistaken for amphibians (such as the Shin Meiwa PS-1) which carry their own beaching gear. Usually, this is a wheeled dolly or temporary set of wheels used to move a flying boat or floatplane from the water and allow it to be moved around on land. It can also appear as a conventional undercarriage. These are not built to take the impact of the aircraft landing on them. An amphibian can leave the water without anyone getting in the water to attach beaching wheels (or even having to have any handy), yet a fully functional undercarriage is heavy and impacts the aircraft&#x27;s performance, and is not required in all cases, so an aircraft may be designed to carry its own.

==Hazards==
An occasional problem with amphibians is with ensuring that the wheels are in the correct position for landing. In normal operation, the pilot uses a checklist, verifying each item. Since amphibians can land with them up or down though, the pilot must take extra care to ensure that they are correct for the chosen landing place. Landing wheels-up on land may damage the keel (unless done on wet grass, a technique occasionally used by pilots of pure flying boats), while landing wheels-down on water will almost always flip the aircraft upside down, causing substantial damage.
==Usage==
Amphibious aircraft are heavier and slower, more complex and more expensive to purchase and operate than comparable landplanes. However, they are also more versatile. Even though they cannot hover or land vertically, they compete favorably with helicopters for some jobs and can do so at a significantly lower cost. Amphibious aircraft can also be much faster and have a longer range than comparable helicopters, and can achieve nearly the range of land-based aircraft, because an airplane&#x27;s wing is more efficient than a helicopter&#x27;s lifting rotor. This makes amphibious aircraft, such as the Grumman Albatross and the Shin Meiwa US-2, useful for long-range air–sea rescue tasks. In addition, amphibious aircraft are particularly useful as bush planes that can engage in light transport in remote areas. In these areas, they often have to operate not only from airstrips, but from lakes and rivers as well.

==History==
In the United Kingdom, traditionally a maritime nation, a large number of amphibians were built between the wars, starting from 1918 with the Vickers Viking and the early 1920s Supermarine Seagull, and were used for exploration and military duties, including search and rescue, artillery spotting and anti-submarine patrol. These evolved throughout the interwar period to culminate in the post–World War II Supermarine Seagull, which was to have replaced the wartime Walrus and the Sea Otter but was overtaken by advances in helicopters. 

From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s in the United States, Sikorsky produced an extensive family of amphibians (the S-34, S-36, S-38, S-39, S-41, S-43) that were widely used for exploration and as airliners around the globe, helping pioneer many overseas air routes where the larger flying boats could not go, and helping to popularize amphibians in the US.
The Grumman Corporation, latecomers to the game, introduced a pair of light utility amphibious aircraft – the Goose and the Widgeon – during the late 1930s for the civilian market. However, their military potential could not be ignored, and many were ordered by the US Armed forces and their allies during World War II. 
Not coincidentally, the Consolidated Catalina (named for Santa Catalina Island off the coast of southern California, whose resort was popularized partly by the use of amphibians in the 1930s, including Sikorskys and Douglas Dolphins) was redeveloped from being a pure flying boat into an amphibian during the war. After the war, the United States military ordered hundreds of the Grumman Albatross and its variants for a variety of roles. However, like the pure flying boat, they were made obsolete by helicopters which could operate in sea conditions far beyond what the best seaplane could manage.

Development of amphibians was not limited to the United Kingdom and the United States. In any case, few designs saw more than limited service, as there was a widespread preference for pure flying boats and floatplanes, due to the weight penalty the undercarriage imposed. Russia also developed a number of important flying boats, including the widely used pre-war Shavrov Sh-2 utility flying boat, and postwar the Beriev Be-12 anti-submarine and maritime patrol amphibian. Development of amphibians continues in Russia with the jet-engined Beriev Be-200. Italy, bordering the Mediterranean and Adriatic, has had a long history of waterborne aircraft, going back to the first Italian aircraft to fly. While most were not amphibians, quite a few were, including the Savoia-Marchetti S.56A and the Piaggio P.136.

Amphibious aircraft have been particularly useful in the unforgiving terrain of Alaska and northern Canada, where many remain in civilian service, providing remote communities with vital links to the outside world. The Canadian Vickers Vedette was developed for forestry patrol in remote areas; a job that previously was done by canoe and took weeks could be accomplished in hours, revolutionizing forestry conservation. Although successful, flying-boat amphibians like the Vedette ultimately proved less versatile than floatplane amphibians and are no longer as common as they once were. Amphibious floats that could be attached to any aircraft were developed, turning any aircraft into an amphibian, and these continue to be essential for getting into the more remote locations during the summer months when the only areas suitable for landing are the waterways.

Despite the gains of amphibious floats, small flying-boat amphibians continued to be developed into the 1960s, with the Republic Seabee and Lake LA-4 series proving popular, though neither was a commercial success due to factors beyond their makers&#x27; control. Many today are homebuilts, by necessity as the demand is too small to justify the costs of development, with the Volmer Sportsman being a popular choice among the many offerings. 

With the increased availability of airstrips in remote communities, fewer amphibious aircraft are manufactured today than in the past, although a handful of amphibious aircraft are still produced, such as the Bombardier 415, ICON A5, and the amphibious-float–equipped version of the Cessna Caravan.

Development of amphibians has continued into the new millennium. The ShinMaywa US-2 was developed in the 2000s in Japan for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

To the east it meets the departments of Copán and Ocotepeque, Honduras and to the west, the municipality of Concepción Las Minas and the Resume Chiquimula department.

== History ==

=== Pre-Hispanic ===

The northern region and center of Esquipulas is located within the geographical area known as Region Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; people of Guatemala. Chorti culture and the Kingdom Payaki or Payaqui which was notable for leaving some of their old architectures developed within this municipality.

==== Culture Chorti ====

The first settlers were descendants from Maya people of Copán (archaeological site) Copán, Honduras who came to these lands, shortly after they were forming groups or ethnic groups including ethnic Ch&#x27;orti &#x27;, these moved Esquipulas after leaving or moving of its ancient cities, this culture achievement develop for several years, even after of the Spanish conquest these were gradually disappearing from the municipality and moved to other municipality such as Camotan, Chiquimula and Jocotan, although they reached the Valley of Esquipulas, this culture is developed more in the villages Timushan and Chanmagua.

==== Kingdom Payaqui ====

Another ethnic group who lived in this municipality was ethnically Payaqui. The priest Topiltzín Axcitl or Nacxit was the founder of the Kingdom of Payaqui. The origin of this town, is located in the depths of the mystery of the cultura maya (the name Isquitzuchil´ appears in the history from the earliest times in 1000 BC).

=== 16th Century ===

==== Spanish colonization ====
In 1524 Spanish forces first established themselves in the area now known as Guatemala with the settling of the area&#x27;s first municipality at Tecpan. By 1525 Spanish forces had reached the region South of the Valley of Monte Christo, this region then being inhabited by the Chorti Indians.

==== Conquest of Isquitzuchil ====

In 1525, the captains Juan Pérez Dardón, Sancho de Barahona and Bartolomé Becerra under the command of Pedro de Alvarado conquered the province of Chiquimula, and as a result the Catholic religion was imposed upon the conquered peoples. In April 1530 the locals led by chieftains Copantl and Galel again revolted against the conquerors and as a result, Don Francisco de Orduña ordered the captains Pedro de Amalina and Hernando de Chávez that they leave from Mitlan to &quot;pacify&quot; the region, who departed along with 60 Marines, 400 Allied Indians and 30 horses. The region was well defended and hindered the entry of the Spanish army. After fighting for 3 days, the inhabitants of the region finally surrendered, mostly for peace and public tranquility, and also for fear of the Castilian arms, in the words of the Chief.

==== Esquipulas ====

Between 1550 and 1560 the town of Yzquipulas (later Esquipulas) was founded in this region by Juan Pérez Dardón. Dardón brought with him slaves of Mayan-Chortí and Mayan-Payaquí origin from other regions of the Province of Chiquimula de la Sierra. The main street in town was laid out, running from the main Iglesia de Santiago in the South, to the town&#x27;s aqueduct in the North. The city plan eventually grew to include two city plazas, now known as &quot;Parque de la Basilica,&quot; in the South and in the North, adjacent to the older parish church &quot;Iglesia de Santiago,&quot;is the &quot;Parque Centroamerica&quot; plaza.

In the early 1700s Esquipulas was one of the most populous Spanish communities in the area. According to the town&#x27;s baptismal registry, it then had a population of 198 people. A century later, the records reflected that the community had reached 851 inhabitants, representing 30% of the total population of the department of Chiquimula. Apparently settlers were attracted to the region by the great fertility of its valleys.

=== Catholicism in Esquipulas ===

In 1594, the villagers asked the Portuguese sculptor Quirio Cataño to sculpt a crucified Christ with a dark complexion. The Portuguese sculptor, who resided in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, delivered the Black Christon October 4, 1594, as established in the initial contract. The image was collected by the inhabitants of Esquipulas and taken to their small town, arriving on March 9, 1595, and initially installed in a small shrine in a monastic hermitage just outside of the town. The inhabitants of that time called the sculpture &quot;miraculous&quot;, which drew the attention of the surrounding Catholic populations. By 1650 the town was one of the most important Catholic sites of the captaincy general since it was visited by people from the provinces of El Salvador and Comayagua. In 1680, the construction of the Santiago Church began, which was completed in 1682, the year in which the sculpture of the Black Christ was moved from the hermitage.

In 1740 the fifteenth bishop of Guatemala, fray Pedro Pardo de Figueroa, in order to attend the ever-growing pilgrimages dedicated to the Christ of Esquipulas and in gratitude for the healing of a disease, commissioned the construction of a larger basilica to the architect Felipe José de Porres, son of Diego de Porres and grandson of José de Porres, renowned senior architects of the capital city of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros.

Fray Pedro Pardo de Figueroa died on February 2, 1751, during a visit to Esquipulas to supervise the construction of the sanctuary and was buried in the basilica of Esquipulas, according to his last will. He was replaced by Francisco de Figueredo y Victoria, who continued the construction of the basilica, which was completed at the end of 1758. On November 4 of that year he decreed the solemn dedication of the new sanctuary, which was inaugurated on January 4, 1759. The image of the Christ of Esquipulas was transferred to the new basilica on Saturday January 6, 1759.

== Education ==
52% (27.664 inh.) of the population is made up young people within 0 and 25 years of age, of which 64% (17.705) of that 52% (27.664) of young scholars. Education quality is high active Esquipulas, +89.0, the best quality education across the east.

== Tourism ==
Because of its importance as a tourist and religious center, the population of Esquipulas is dedicated mostly to that trade, although there is also a strong coffee industry which produces some of the best varieties available. Currently, religious tourism and hospitality industry has boomed, fueled by the large number of pilgrims visiting the sacred image of the Black Christ of Esquipulas.

Tourism in Esquipulas grew gradually, since the area is a very attractive destination due to its natural resources and its colonial history, along with its culture expressed in its customs and cuisine. There is a strong interest of visitors on religious colonial places like the Basilica of Esquipulas, which was built in 1740 under the sponsorship of Monsignor Pedro Pardo de Figueroa (first Metropolitan Archbishop of Guatemala appoint in 1744) in order to meet the increasingly growing pilgrimages dedicated to the Black Christ of Esquipulas. Pardo de Figueroa commissioned the construction of a temple to Philip José de Porres, the son of Diego de Porres and grandson of Joseph de Porres, renowned architects from the capital city Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and the funding came from the cotton fields owners.

=== Basilica of Esquipulas ===

In 1956, Pope Pius XII erected the Prelature nullius for the Black Christ and established by the municipality of Esquipulas and the Santuario de Esquipulas Cathedral as its venue. The Archbishop of Guatemala, Monsignor Mariano Rossell y Arellano, was appointed the First Prelate of Esquipulas; one of the first concerns of Rossell y Arellano was to seek a religious order to take over the care of the sanctuary. Finally, he found support from the Benedictine Abbey of San José, located in Louisiana, USA. The order sent three monks in 1959 with the mission of founding the Benedictine Monastery of Esquipulas which is responsible for the care of the Basilica in the 21st century.

In 1961, Archbishop Rossell sent a request to Pope John XXIII, who, based in religious, cultural and historic shrine of Esquipulas raised to the rank of Minor Basilica. This Basilica is the only one that has been erected in Central America.

=== Stone of the Compadres ===

These two stones, one on top of the other in strange balance, have stood the test of time as well as historical earthquakes. They are not small at all: the upper stone is about the size of a regular sedan and together they reach a height of about three meters and a calculated weight of 50 tons. A legend in Esquipulas says that two friends became &quot;compadres&quot; (godfathers to the offspring of the other), but in spite of this sacred pact, one of them was carried away by desire and seduced the other&#x27;s wife. They were turned into stone as punishment for their sins, left for all to see their forbidden desire for each other, among the whispering wind and swaying trees. On the other hand, traditional communities believe that the stones are a manifestation of divine powers, or materialization of divine will; therefore, the place is scene of sacred rituals, prayers, sacrifices and penances. The stones are blackened by the rituals performed there, often including a sacrificed, beheaded cock placed between candles.

=== Mine Cave ===

The oral tradition dictates that it was in this place where Christ reveals the image of the famous sculptor Quirio Black Catano, creator of the famous statue venerated in Esquipulas.

Are located south of the city right next to the Basilica and one kilometer away from the road leading to Honduras, there are some hills which one was drilled in a cross lying north to south in the more margins of the Rio Chacalapa or Miracles. It is said that many went through all these places in search of a mine that salvation was to finance the work of the Basilica, but finally, up and down and doing tests, the savior was found, began drilling and operating silver mine that was a fact, when they needed was more like a miracle those deluded savior.

These caves were like a memory of that silver mine, which by its geographical location near the Basilica, they found there has been attributed to the miraculous Christ of Esquipulas, which is not true because the documents were later found which consists reliable that the image was burilado by the architect in Antigua Guatemala Quirio Catano, however many indigenous pilgrims from the West, with a mixture of Christian faith and traditions or beliefs, come to visit these caves, performing their own rituals, burn pon and candles, even money left within them.

The caves are within private land whose owner have taken advantage of the touristic value that they have, given the influx of pilgrims and the river that runs through the place. They installed the &quot;Cuevas de las Minas&quot; Ecological Park, which has a zoo with more than 25 species, and several modern amenities.

=== Park Chatún ===

The cathedral at Esquipulas was proclaimed a basilica in 1961 by Pope John XXIII, and in 1995, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the shrine, Pope John Paul II proclaimed it &quot;the spiritual center of Central America.&quot; Every year, thousands of pilgrims from Guatemala, the United States, Mexico, Europe and other Central American countries flock to pay homage to the dark wooden image of the crucified Christ, the most revered Catholic shrine in the region.

El Santuario de Chimayo, a major Roman Catholic pilgrimage site in Chimayó, New Mexico, United States, is closely linked with Esquipulas.

=== Tierra Santa tablets===

Esquipulas is famous for its &quot;Tierra Santa&quot; (Holy Earth) clay tablets that are purchased by the pilgrims during church festivals. The clay from the local deposits is cleaned and pressed into small cakes. Such clay is also known as &quot;tierra bendita&quot;, or &quot;Tierra del Santo&quot;. The popularity of this clay is attested by the many names (for example, &quot;akipula, cipula, askipula, kipula&quot;) that are used for such medicinal clay tablets all around Central America. Pilgrims sometimes eat the supposedly curative clay, or they rub themselves with it.

Similar customs prevail at the sister shrine El Santuario de Chimayo in the US.

<doc id="326782" wikidata="Q5399259" url="?curid=326782" title="Esquipulas Peace Agreement">
<text>The Esquipulas Nicaraguan Peace Agreement, also known as the Central American Peace Accords, was a peace initiative in the mid-1980s to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years, and in some cases (notably Guatemala) for decades. It built upon groundwork laid by the Contadora Group from 1983 to 1985. The agreement was named for Esquipulas, Guatemala, where the initial meetings took place. The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill&#x27;s top lobbyists, William C. Chasey.

In May 1986, a summit meeting at dawn, &quot;Esquipulas I,&quot; took place, attended by the five Central American presidents. On February 15, 1987, Costa Rican President Óscar Arias submitted a Peace Plan which evolved from this meeting. During 1986 and 1987, the &quot;Esquipulas Process&quot; was established, in which the Central American heads of state agreed on economic cooperation and a framework for peaceful conflict resolution. The &quot;Esquipulas II Accord&quot; emerged from this and was signed in Guatemala City by President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, President José Napoleón Duarte of El Salvador, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, President José Azcona del Hoyo of Honduras and President Óscar Arias Sánchez of Costa Rica on August 7, 1987.

Esquipulas II defined a number of measures to promote national reconciliation, an end to hostilities, democratization, free elections, the termination of all assistance to irregular forces, negotiations on arms controls, and assistance to refugees. It also laid the ground for international verification procedures and provided a timetable for implementation.

==Involvement of Nicaragua==
The US government refused to recognize the Sandinista regime&#x27;s legitimacy to represent Nicaragua in The Esquipulas Process, on the basis that the Sandinistas had taken power in a 1979 coup d&#x27;etat against the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, establishing the Junta of National Reconstruction. Although in 1984 the Sandinistas held an election, in which they won the majority of the votes, the main opposition parties boycotted this election under US pressure, and the US was able to claim that the victory was illegitimate. However the June 1986 outcome of the International Court of Justice case &quot;Nicaragua v. United States&quot; created a &quot;major shift in the regional context&quot; which ultimately persuaded the other Central American leaders to accept Nicaragua as an equal partner. &quot;Suddenly, Nicaragua, which had been treated like an outcast on more than one occasion, was walking the legal, if not moral, high-ground...&quot; The November 1986 disclosure of the Iran–Contra affair further weakened the US influence on the process.

==After Esquipulas==
In subsequent years, Esquipulas laid the groundwork for the Oslo Accord (not to be confused with the 1993 Oslo Accords between the Israeli government and the PLO). This was a preliminary agreement between the Guatemalan National Reconciliation Commission (CNR) and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) which brought to an end more than three decades of strife in Guatemala.

It also inspired the signing of a general peace agreement in El Salvador, the Chapultepec Peace Accords and others.

Arias&#x27; efforts on behalf of the Esquipulas Peace Agreement earned him the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize.

<doc id="326786" wikidata="Q745858" url="?curid=326786" title="Henri Langlois">
<text>Henri Langlois (; 13 November 1914 – 13 January 1977) was a French film archivist and cinephile. A pioneer of film preservation, Langlois was an influential figure in the history of cinema. His film screenings in Paris in the 1950s are often credited with providing the ideas that led to the development of the auteur theory.

Langlois was co-founder of the Cinémathèque Française with Georges Franju and Jean Mitry and also co-founder of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) in 1938. Through close collaboration with the Cinémathèque&#x27;s longtime chief archivist, Lotte Eisner, he worked to preserve films and film history in the post-war era. An eccentric who was often at the centre of controversy for his methods, he also served as a key influence on the generation of young cinephiles and critics who would become the French New Wave.

In 1974, Langlois received an Academy Honorary Award for &quot;his devotion to the art of film, his massive contributions in preserving its past and his unswerving faith in its future&quot;.

==Career at the Cinémathèque Française==

In 1936, Langlois, Franju and Mitry founded the &quot;Cinémathèque Française&quot; in Paris, their film theatre and museum. The collection grew from ten films in 1936 to more than 60,000 films by the early 1970s. More than an archivist, Langlois saved many films which were at risk of vanishing. Besides films, Langlois also helped to preserve other items related to cinema such as cameras, projection equipment, costumes, and vintage theatre programmes. He eventually collected so many items that he donated them in 1972 to the Musée du Cinéma in the Palais de Chaillot, where they covered a two-mile span of film artifacts and memorabilia. The collection was relocated due to damage from a fire in 1997.

During the Second World War, Langlois and his colleagues helped to save many films that were at risk of being destroyed during the Nazi occupation of France.

Langlois influenced the French New Wave directors François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol and Alain Resnais among others, and the generation of filmmakers that followed. Some of these filmmakers were called &quot;les enfants de la cinémathèque&quot; (&quot;children of the cinémathèque&quot;), as they could often be found in the front row of packed screenings.

Langlois&#x27; romantic attitude to film was in contrast to the scientific approach utilised by Ernest Lindgren at Britain&#x27;s National Film Archive. Langlois&#x27; methods were unconventional. He was accused of having no rational approach to record keeping. The Cinémathèque lost a portion of its collection to a nitrate film fire on 10 July 1959. Sources are in conflict as to the cause and the extent of the loss.

In September 1959, a rift developed between the Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF) and the Cinémathèque. Langlois had been involved in the founding of FIAF. The dispute between the two bodies was resolved only some years after Langlois had died.

===Removal and reinstatement===
In 1968, French culture minister André Malraux tried to fire Langlois due to the latter&#x27;s arrogance and iron-fisted rule of the museum. On 7 February, officially due to Langlois&#x27; mismanagement and inadequate housing of archived filmstock, the state-supported Cinémathèque board replaced Langlois with Pierre Barbin. Local and international uproar ensued, and even the prestigious Cannes Film Festival was halted in protest that year. Protesters in Paris included the student activist Daniel Cohn-Bendit from University of Nanterre-Paris. Support came in telegrams from renowned directors, from Alfred Hitchcock to Akira Kurosawa to Federico Fellini to Gianni Serra. Malraux eventually reinstated Langlois after intense debate on 22 April, while reducing museum funding. The was in retrospect seen as a prelude to the larger May 68 protests. Truffaut dedicated his 1968 film &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; to Langlois, and it opens with a shot of the shuttered and locked Cinémathèque.

==Later life==
In 1970, Langlois selected seventy films from the Cinémathèque&#x27;s collection for inclusion in &quot;Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum,&quot; an exhibition in celebration of the Centennial of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The exhibition, co-sponsored by the Metropolitan Museum and the City Center of Music and Drama in New York, showed seventy films dating from the medium&#x27;s first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. Langlois selected films for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, including work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the museum&#x27;s first major undertaking in film.

In 1974, Langlois received an Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime work with the Cinémathèque. He died three years later and is interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

Place Henri Langlois in the 13th arrondissement in Paris is named in his honour.

==Documentaries about Langlois==
In 1970, an English language documentary &quot;Henri Langlois&quot; was made about his life&#x27;s work, featuring interviews with Ingrid Bergman, Lillian Gish, François Truffaut, Catherine Deneuve, Jeanne Moreau and others. The film was produced and directed by Roberto Guerra and Eila Hershon.

Edgardo Cozarinsky&#x27;s 1994 documentary &quot;Citizen Langlois&quot; is an essayistic biography showing Langlois&#x27; progress from amateur collector to nouvelle vague hero and friend of the stars.

Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;The Dreamers&quot; addresses the firing of Langlois and includes period footage of the events.

In 2004, Jacques Richard directed a documentary on Langlois&#x27;s career, &quot;The Phantom of the Cinémathèque&quot;. It features interviews with friends, colleagues, academics, and such movie luminaries as Simone Signoret, Godard, Chabrol, Truffaut and Jean-Michel Arnold.

In 2014, the Cinémathèque released a short documentary titled &quot;Henri Langlois vu par...&quot;, in which thirteen filmmakers, including Agnès Varda, Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Polanski, Manoel de Oliveira, Bernardo Bertolucci, Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Wim Wenders talk about Langlois and their relationship with him.
